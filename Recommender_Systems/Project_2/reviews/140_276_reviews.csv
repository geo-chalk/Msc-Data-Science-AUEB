140,276,Somnifex,4.33,"From a 12 oz. bottle, poured into a glass.  Lovely smooth amber color, with a fingers-width of creamy white head. Settled after the first couple of sips to a fine cap, with delicate lacing.  Initial scent was bright, citrusy, with pine. Taste carried the same—initial brightness, with a resinous base tone. Settled into a pleasing bitterness, like good tea, that gradually settled to a doughy finish. As it warmed, the bitterness—the hops, I presume—shouldered its way to the front.  Mouth-feel was lively. Robust carbonation, with a notable presence, despite not feeling particularly thick.  A fine beer, it seems to be.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,MackT,3.69,"12 oz. Bottle, 12 weeks old. Clear, medium amber color. Light, non offensive hoppy aroma. Taste is light, good introduction to the IPA style.

140,276,JZH1000,4.16,"Had on tap at Hoffbrau bar and grill Westminster, CO  On arrival 1 finger of dense white head was present, sitting on top of a light amber clear body. Lacing is left. Nice looking beet.  Aroma is bright with some American WC hops and a lightly sweet maltiness. Definitely a hoppy beer, but I appreciate the amber notes that I can pick up.  Taste follows the nose but brings an actual caramel maltiness. An herbal piney bitterness is present, but the bitterness fades a bit giving way for a sweet darker doughy maltiness. This is actually pretty dang good. Very balanced woth a light sweetness following some bright and bitter hop character.  Feel is big and malty but not huge. A bit more on the crisp side despite the mouthcoating malt presence. Definitely versatile, but leaning toward a full bodied summer beer.  Overall, this beer was pretty impressive, and I'm not sure why I haven't given it a shot yet. Amber ""pale ales"" are a very nice beer style, but they could use a bit of a marketing revamp if I do say so myself.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

The nose is dominated by citrus and pine hops. The taste matches the nose with a light amount of caramel malt in the background. The bitterness from the pine and citrus hops lingers. The Ale is medium bodied with a moderate carbonation.

140,276,Perioddicals,3.73,"L - Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a standard pint glass at roughly 50 degrees. Pours a clear amber color with an off-white 1/2 finger head on a tame pour. Minor lacing that doesn’t stay. Head quickly reduces down to a light film.  S - Pleasant pine hops and citrus zest. Very nice light flavor scents overall.  T - Taste follows scent. Sweet fruit zest paired with piney and floral hops. Very light and refreshing. There’s a nice sweet flavor that I can’t pinpoint that comes through as well. On second thought, it’s grapefruit. Very nice addition.  F - Not a lot of carbonation and a lighter mouthfeel.  O - Overall this is a solid beer. Very good for regular drinking, and a standout for outdoors and camping. The sweet and bitter flavors provide a nice mix. I am by no means a hophead, but this is a nice, acceptable amount of hops and bitterness.

140,276,iamkishanshah,4.74,"Sierra Nevada pale ale was introduced in 1980, this is a historic craft beers of the world that helped shape the craft beer game that we know & love. This is also one of the first beers I've ever tried and the review will be a bit biased as a result.  Look: Thin 1.5 finger - off white/ cream color head and a cloudy orange in color.  Smell: Smells wonderful - citrus, barley malt, sweet piney aroma (I wish I could make a perfume out of this fragrance).  Taste: Very refreshing - hop forward with a punch of citrus and pleasantly bitter hops, piney and grapefruit notes, mild caramel-like sweetness and crisp clean water.  Feel: So smooth - Medium soft & fluffy ale body with a mildly sweet and semi-dry finish.  Overall, it's an exceptional beer!

140,276,Ismaelmyself,4,A perfect every day beer.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,AlexandraDen,3.9,"Pours a deep-ish golden-orange, with a nice finger and a half, foamy white head. The head has lasting impact in my glass, lasting the entirety of the drink, well over 15 minutes. Long lines of bubbles run up the glass. Looks amazing. Thick generous lacing lines the entirety of the glass as it empties.  Smells of wheat, bread, floral hops with a touch of bitterness. It’s clean and fresh smelling. Some piney notes, notes of grassy straw. General zesty citrus in the background. It’s as clean and classic as you can get.  Some have described SNPA as a mix between an APA and an IPA, but this is just straight up APA for me with mild balancing bitterness. Gentle floral hop, grassy flavours wash over the tongue before revealing straight up sweet caramel malt, some tasty bready wheat notes, and the citrus I notice here, mostly grapefruit. Gentle but tasty. It’s so straight up clean that it almost feels more complex than it is. SNPA has never been described as the absolute boldest, biggest smash your face flavour beer, but it isn’t any worse for it. When you want that clean, crisp, yet flavourful and subtle APA, this is the taste you think of in your mind. It is your classic example personified in an actual beer.  It’s well carbonated but not super strong; resulting in a nicely smooth, mildly creamy sip. Subtle medium long finish, that leaves just a hint of bitterness and lightly roasted grains on your tongue. Finishes clean and semi-dry. It’s so easy drinking and clean I’d consider this light bodied myself.  When thinking and comparing this beer to others, I want to give it a higher ranking than I ultimately put here. There is more aspects to some beers than just the categories here. SNPA is a work-horse, a beer that can be easily drank all night, be enjoyed by quite literally every single beer drinker no matter what style preference you have, and is a super clean straight up benchmark of the style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,andypeters1971,4.58,"Had it on cask at Brick Store, Decatur, Georgia, March 2022. I've never been an IPA or even a pale ale guy. The mouthfeel from the hops just doesn't do it for me. Having it on cask is an entirely different story. Some (not all) previous cask tries on my part conveyed a beer devoid of all carbonation, mouthfeel and coldness all in the name of purity. Now comes Sierra Pale on cask and the difference could not be more distinct. Maybe the best mouthfeel ever and then you get all of the taste profile and aroma that you would want, plus just about the perfect level of carbonation, and there you have it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,IKR,3.93,"Bottle dated 9-28-2021 Appearance: Cloudy amber color with generous-sized, thick, off-white head that slowly faded. A nice-looking beer.  Smell: Mild piney aromas and mild bready notes. The nose is fairly mild, but the beer was bottled over 4 months ago.  Taste: Some mildly sweet fruit notes and some faint pine notes present in the flavor profile. The beer has a mildly sweet initial taste which dies off somewhat with some lingering bitter hop notes.  Mouth-feel: Fairly light-bodied with a fairly generous level of carbonation.  Overall: A good beer that I've had before but never reviewed. I suspect the beer being over 5 months ago may have impacted it's impression so I may seek out a fresh example and review it again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,BloodSoakedAleMug,4.18,"Look: Pours a translucent, bright orange with a two finger head of soapy, off-white foam. Laces the glass pretty well.  Aroma: Caramel malt and strong pine resin. Very bitter on the nose. Slightly tropical with mild hints of orange zest. Fairly straightforward.  Taste: Pleasantly bitter upfront with a warm, dry resinous pine sap note. Goes tropical midpalate with bitter-sweet flavors of orange zest and peppery grapefruit rind. Fades out into savory flavors of brown sugar and toffee.  Feel: Thirst quenching. Medium bodied, moderately carbonated.  Overall: I'm very surprised it took me so long to get around to reviewing this one since I drink it all the time. Sierra Nevada pale ale is one of my all time favorite beers. You honestly can't go wrong with this - an absolute classic American pale ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,wadamslll,3.38,"Too bitter for me. I remember liking this when I was younger, last Sierra I had was 18 years ago. I do like how crisp and refreshing it is. Glad I bought it though, as I continue my search for the best beer for me I can buy on regular basis. Sam Adams is next, then anchor steam. Gonna keep trying and digging the journey.  Lighter than an IPA which is nice, as IPAs I am not a fan. But 805 tastes better than Sierra. I don’t understand why this is rated as Outstanding. I don’t have to however. Again, I am a Lager guy.  So I am on the 3rd Sierra, and this beer is getting better. It’s quite a satisfying buzz too. Think I need to look for stronger beers.  Ok on my 5th Sierra. Gonna drink the whole 6. It gets better. Past the 3rd. Still, my too bitter comment is honest. Probably why I prefer lagers and stouts. But I get it.

140,276,highdesertdrinker,4.34,"My turn to rate the old favorite and I can’t believe it either. Citrus, piney hops dominate the smell and it pours a rich, copper hue with some head. Tastes a lot like the aroma with the piney, fruity taste, a good little kick at 37 ibu’s, and a solid malt backbone. It works together in near perfect harmony and the mouthful is luxurious and somewhat creamy which is a characteristic I seem to like.

The flavor is citrus and pine mostly with a light caramel malt presence. The mouthfeel is a medium texture that is dry, crisp, with a light bitter hop finish. There is a reason this is a classic, there is a nice balance in the flavors and the aroma making this pale ale very enjoyable.

140,276,Rug,4.18,"Bottled 4/29/21  Man, it's a shock to me that I've never actually reviewed this legendary brew. One of my gateway beers into craft in 2018, which despite not being very long ago feels like a lifetime ago for a younger person such as myself. So given the site-wide tasting today, it's time to give this old classic/consistent go-to beer at restaurants a proper review  Pours a slightly cloudy amber gold with 2 fingers of white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing  For me personally, the nose is always the star of the show for this beer, really tying it all together with an exceptional balance of malt and hops. I'm picking up on aromas of piney hops, caramel malt, pithy grapefruit, orange zest, and light lemon  Oh man, what an iconic tasting beer. As I said, not quite as incredible as the aroma, but still nicely balanced. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting fresh piney hops, lemon peel, orange zest, bready malt, and light caramel. The swallow brings notes of pithy grapefruit, bready malt, toasted grain, floral peppery hops, and orange zest  A light medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a crisp yet full beer. Finishes mostly dry with a light spice to offset the malt  A beer more than the sum of its parts, an institution even. It's a classic for a reason, and I'm glad we have a day to celebrate it.

140,276,sulldaddy,4.29,"Sampling a chilled 12 oz bottle poured into my snifter. The beer is packaged 5/2021. The beer pours a clear amber to copper color with an eggshell white fluffy head of 3 cm that fades slowly to a rocky surface layer and some clingy lattice. The foam sticks around as a sturdy surface layer throughout the tasting. Some very fine lazy streams of carbonation are rising to the surface. The aroma is some pine notes and a bit of grapefruit rind dominate, but I do get a little caramel and grainy bread note coming through the nose. First sip reveals a medium body and very fine gentle rolling carbonation. Fairly soft texture and very easy drinking. Flavor is some crisp hop bite of pine sap and grapefruit rind which rolls to some milder caramel notes in the background. Finish is pretty clean but a lingering hop bite leaves a bitter note across my palate. Also a very drying finish. No hint of any ABV and the beer is very easy to drink. Glad to try this one again, AND finally review this beer.

140,276,Jaycase,4.44,"12 oz can. Packaged in Mills River on June 04, 2021  L: Amber in color, fluffy white head. Noticed (transfixed by) two small streams of bubbles flowing in parallel from the bottom of the glass to the surface. Left a moderate level of lacing. S: Primarily piney resin intertwined with a slight citrus presence. Caramel malt combines with those characteristics to give a nice, pleasant aroma. T: Mostly getting a piney, resinous character giving off a slight bitterness. Perhaps some citrus as a secondary characteristic but it's light to me and seems to give clear deference to the piney resinous aspect. Malt presence is perfect for this beer imo. F: A creamy feel gives way to a slight oily finish. moderate carbonation. O: SNPA is considered a classic for good reason.

When poured, the perfume explodes even more and a caramel note also emerges in the background of the herbaceous ones always predominant. ""Deep gold"" color. Abundant, soft and tasty foam that does not fade and remains a hat to the beer, therefore excellent persistence. In the mouth, body characterized by the classic smoothness of this beer which, if on the one hand is similar to an English Pale Ale, on the other hand releases hints that are markedly more malty (caramel, biscuit), more fruity (grapefruit, the white orange skin ) and ends with a decidedly more important amaro. The drink is short, refreshing (thanks to a pleasantly lively carbonation), pleasantly tasty and bitter. On the finish and as soon as the beer rests a little in the glass, a final cereal note emerges that tries to rebalance the bitter taste that remains in the mouth. No-frills beer , always at the top in the quality / price / risk ratio (given its constancy over time, at least in my opinion).",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,FBarber,4.45,"SN Pale Ale is one of the first ""IPA"" I ever drank when I first got into craft beer. At that time I didn't like any IPAs and petty much avoided them completely. I actually didn't like SNPA the first time I had it, but after having a couple more I came to appreciate the balance this beer provides. It was definitely one of the ""gateway"" ""IPAs"" that eventually got me to like these hoppier beers. Its funny though, because as the style changes and shifts, I find myself often craving a SNPA as what I really want from an IPA. (And yea, I know its a pale ale, not an IPA, but its easiest to refer to the general category).  This bottle I am drinking today was packaged on 5/21/21. It pours a lovely burnished orange color. Mostly clear, but there are some yeast particulates creating a slight cloudiness. A thick frothy buff head forms on the beer, lingers momentarily, then dissipates leaving just a ring of foam along the outside of the top of the beer. Aroma has light nots of citrus, orange and grapefruit. There is a certain maltiness to the nose, but its quite balanced. Whisps of honey tinge the aroma providing a light sweetness.  Taste has notes of citrus up front - orange and grapefruit - transitioning into some pine and green hop notes. The bitterness is there, but pretty mild - again tit comes across as balanced. Notes of lightly toasted biscuit malts provide the back bone to the beer. Feel is light, smooth and easy drinking. Moderate, but very smooth, carbonation.  Overall this is the classic pale ale. I was drinking this one this morning and kept thinking to myself ""why don't I drink this more often?"" its better than the vast majority of high priced IPAs I buy.

I remember when living in WNC, I'd go to a BBQ and always end up seeing several bottles of the stuff. It pairs well with everything, is inoffensive in taste, and isn't filling in the slightest despite its full body. My sole complaint with this beer is that of a common problem with Sierra Nevada beers in general: too hoppy! If the hops were any more overpowering, this brew would easily be an IPA.

140,276,Sabtos,4.07,"I've had this many times, but never as a side by side with the other coast's storied Pale Ale, Hill Farmstead Edward, which many know as having taken its inspiration from SNPA. Actually having the opportunity to do this head to head with Hill finally canning Edward is a blessing in the middle of a pandemic, but finding that it only elevated both beers in unique ways was even more pleasant of a surprise, so I couldn't help but completely delete and redo my old review of this reliable standby, as the comparisons and contrasts are very enjoyable to take note of.  While Edward is a hazy, nearly fully opaque pale amber-orange with a moderate, creamy khaki head, SNPA is sparkling clear darker amber with a slightly taller, slightly darker khaki foam head that collapses under large airy bubbles.  The similarities are present, yes. Edward is a little more bitter and a little more maltier than most of Hill's hoppy brews, or many other NEPAs/IPAs, which is in line with elements of SNPA, itself further diverging by being toastier and adding very mild notes of caramel and pine resinous aftershave.  However, the differences are stark. Drastically stark.  Edward is creamier, fuller, and juicier. It almost has a vanilla cream quality by comparison, with that Hill yeast and shortbread-like malt combination. It even has a hint of that bubblegum character to it that I always get in Tree House brews, and rarely get elsewhere, which is the biggest surprise to me here.  Either way, none of that takes away from SNPA, which is a high quality beer that's immensely crushable for a relatively bitter ale with a respectable complexity and insane shelf life. It may even be the preferred option for some, such as my old lady, who enjoyed SNPA more for it's drinkability in this head to head. With that in mind, Edward does feel heavier, but it's so delicious I wouldn't change a thing about it either.

Picking up a lot of floral, earthy & pine notes in the aroma. Taste pretty much follows the nose, the bitterness of this beer is very balanced. Medium carbonation with a raw feeling to it. Can't go wrong with this classic beer, it's widely available & easily crushable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Steve555,4.08,"Colour is amber/orange with a cream head that fades but leaves a ring of froth throughout. Aroma is quite floral and earthy. The taste is of burnt quite sweet malts and a piney hop taste that is pleasant and not overpowering. Medium bodied. Mouthfeel is a lingering sweet and bitter with some carbonation on the palate.  Has a piney kick that gives it character yet it's reigned in by some sweetness in the malts to balance things out. Really smooth, balanced and tasty. It's probably not at its freshest by the time it gets to this country but it's still very good.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,kevanb,4,"12oz bottle, dated 05.06.2020, poured into a stemless wine glass.  The beer pours a very nice amber color, copper and orange hues, slight chill haze and some bubbles racing around the beer with about a finger and a half of white frothy head that has good retention and excellent lacing. The aroma is very nice, pine, orange peel, grapefruit juice, a bit grassy with a nice assertive amber malt character. The flavors are good, strong grains lead the way, pale dough and amber cereal grains with a nice crisp grapefruit character, some soft floral and fruitiness comes out before the bitter pine and grapefruit peel start to take over, earthy and grassy at the finish. The mouthfeel is very good, coating with a lively medium body that finishes with a crisp and dry bite.  Verdict: The quintessential west coast style pale ale. After years of experimentation and evolution within the industry, this might seem boring or pedestrian but it's certainly one of the most sessionable and flavorful pale ales and there is good reason why this is the standard to which so many beers get compared.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Light lacing  S - Citrus, Peach and some Berries. Like some mix fruit juices in our ref!  T - Follows the nose. Refreshing citrus, herns, and bitter hops up front, but as stated by a reviewer, balanced by sweet bready malt and a light toast that follows and lingers.  F - Bold but refreshing and easy. Moderate carbonation gives a crisp feel that lightens an otherwise filling drink. Warm of the alcohol all through the drink  O - my first craft beer and now i finally see what they are all about.

S- Can pick up some mild earthy hop aroma and can smell a faint sweet and citrusy aroma as well. T- Initially taste the pale malt sweetness with an ever so slight roasted taste as well. Then there is the hop presence that brings a light citrus note with some earthy bitterness left in the mouth. F-Nice medium bodied and light prickliness from the carbonation. O- A solid pale ale that doesn't go overboard with the hops. It lets the malt be present but also lets there be a pleasant hop taste. Its also at a good price point which is great.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

I remember the dark days of macro-brewery dominance. I cannot believe that one time in my life I'd have expressed the same appreciation for Budweiser.

Sweet candy like lemon flavor, like a lemon loaf cake, warms and develops into grapefruit rind bitterness. Fresh refreshing and balanced. Feel is sturdy with moderate bubbles.

140,276,beerdedking,4.19,The craft beer that started it all for me 25 yrs ago. Still an lovely balance of Cascade hops and caramel malt. Perfect melding of the two with a bite at the end that has stood the test of time,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,hophead723,4.18,"I got a very fresh 12 pack of this packaged in the retro 12 pack, an homage to the original 1980 release with a color gradient that was the result of a printing error for their first batch of this legendary brew. Poured into my Samuel Smith pint glass, paired with Rotisserie chicken and potato salad.  Look: Absolutely brilliantly clear amber that has a hearty slightly off-white head with great retention. A solid, half-pinky thick cap leaves light lacing. The clear body shows moderate carbonation, steadily rising to fuel the aromatic head. This beer looks amazing in the glass.  Smell: The aroma is a perfect blend of biscuity malt that jumps right out of the glass with a nice backing of pine, citrus, grassy, floral, and herbal hops. The Two-row Pale and Caramelized malts hugely contribute to the aroma. I also detect honeysuckle, toasted cracker, and clean barley.  Taste/Feel: A delicious wave of caramel malt washes across the palate, simultaneously balanced by pine, citrus, and herbal hop character. Both citral and botanical, the Cascade hop shines here lending refreshingly zesty bitterness that perfectly compliments the toasty malt profile. I found the botanical properties to give an almost spicy impression, similar to Saaz hops. The body is very smooth. Slight astringency on the mid-palate. The finish is dry and lingers flavors of tea leaves, granny smith apple skin, cracked grain, lemon peel, clover honey, and a mild nuttiness. Very balanced and drinkable.  Overall: It's easy to see why this beer is the best selling pale ale in the country. It's very clean, drinkable, and enjoyable. I love how they single-hopped it with Cascade hops, it's a great way to experience what that hop has to offer. Also, these were very fresh so if yours is even a month old you will likely miss out on a lot of the hop flavors so will not detect any slight spiciness.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,DefenCorps,4.07,"Bottle with retro artwork, bottled 05 Mar. Been forever since I've had one.  A gorgeous copper with a dense, off-white head with excellent retention and exceptional lacing. The nose is excellent. Bright, sharp grapefruit, candied orange, a touch of pine, all tempered by a delicate caramel sweetness. The palate opens moderately bitter with the classic Cascade hop flavor, but without much of the chalkiness I remember. Clean, bright, moderately pungent with orange, grapefruit, a little pine, a delicate sweetness with a light caramel and honey note. The mid palate is dominated by the sweeter flavors duking it out with the bitterness. Let's call it a tie. Drying, bitter, clean and vibrant on the finish, the mouthfeel is initially a little thin and overcarbonated but once it dies down, this is a pleasure. Quite excellent, truly a classic.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,just1cho,4.32,"*Poured into a Teku glass from a 12oz bottle at 50F*  Poured a nice clear amber look into my glass, reminiscent of apple cider. Had a nice finger-half thick head with an off white creamy color to it and a nice retention. Very satisfying to look at, no complains here what-so-ever.  The aroma of this was super balanced between the malt and the hops. I got a nice mellow malty smell reminiscent of Hawaiian rolls and caramel--this was balanced out with some of the esters of the hops, smelling of over-ripe red apples and a slightly vague citrus aroma. If I could pinpoint this aroma combination to something specific, I would say it would be of caramel apples.  As for the taste, it was fairly malt-forward, but it wasn't overwhelmingly so. Towards the middle, I was able to taste more of the fruity apple characteristics that I got from the aroma. Towards the end, I was able to pick up on its more citrus-y grapefruit bitterness--very subtle, not lingering or overwhelming.  The feel of this beer was satisfying and made the beer super drinkable. It was medium bodied with a light-medium carbonation, the best way I can describe the feel of this beer is very clean and very crisp, not to mention refreshing.  Overall, I really liked this beer. I feel like this is a very balanced and well rounded beer that could be paired with almost anything with a meat dish.

Pours a slightly medium darker golden color with a little fluffy white head and some spotty lingering lacing that lasted for a while. Smells of muddled fruity and floral hops, caramel, weaker malt, vanilla, bread and maybe a touch of herbal hops at the finish. Taste follows the nose, ok balance but I wish there were more depth and complexity. Also seemed to lack a decent hoppy bitter bite. Smooth, mild mouthfeel with fairly good carbonation.

Overall: I've never been a hop head kind of guy, in fact IMHO a lot of well regarded craft beers rely on overwhelming the taster with their hops to their detriment.

First beer I had today was An Avery Pacer hazy IPA which is as light and delicious as can be.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,CDBeerDisappear,4.6,"Look: Crystal clear amber color with tons of fine bubbled foamy head. Nothing lacking in the lacing department. Not a lot of visible carbonation, might be my current lighting. Smell: Aroma reminds me of a German pilsner, and to me, that is a compliment. Taste: No sweetness on the tip of the tongue, biter from front to back, bitter on the back of the tongue. Flavor: It tastes like a European beer taking it’s first step toward what becomes the style now know as American IPA. It tastes like history in a glass. I am sooooo glad that Sierra Nevada has continued brewing this from 1980 until now. Feel: Full mouthfeel, light carbonation dry finish Overall: This is such a landmark beer! If you are old and remember how the American beer scene changed from the 70’s to the 80’s, you should drink this beer in remembrance. If you are too young to remember I recommend drinking an American Adjunct Lager, then Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and finally the IPA of your choice. If your drink carefully you will receive revelation from the beer gods of what they intended by calling men like Ken Grossman (founder of Sierra Nevada) into their service. It is a sublime experience! I have given it an overall score that is higher than any of the component scores because of it's place in the history of American brewed beer. This and Anchor Steam changed EVERYTHING!!! Thanks Ken! When you drink this you can experience what Ken Grossman and Fritz Maytag discovered with the Cascade hops, the hops that changed, yes, EVERYTHING! I was in Europe in 1980 and I felt embarrassed by the beer that was produced in the USA.

S- Hmm, apart from a 'beer' fragrance I don't get anything specific or distinctive from it at all - a bit of a surprise. T- It's a grown up APA. It has moderate dry hopping but is not OTT as some comtemporary iterations of the style can be. Neither does it use hops that bring in bonkers (to me) lychee, mango or other out of place fruit facets. F- It has some meatiness to it, some decent presence. O- It's pretty good, drinkable and sessionable. But it's not that distinct or full of character (IMO) to warrant the ratings it seems to attract. Maybe it works better in the US at US prices, vs US competition vs abroad where it's a $-premium import facing different competition?

Smell- Citrus (grapefruit and lemon), resinous pine, caramel malt and floral/herbal notes.  Taste- Much like the nose, pithy citrus with a piney and malty follow through, pretty nicely balanced.  Feel- Medium bodied, dry and crisp with a lingering moderately bitter finish. Medium carbonation on the tongue.  O- What can you say? Basic and really easy drinking.

Crushing all of those keystone lights in high school skewed my tastes just a little...Hard to imagine that this is the easy drinking beer now.  But the difference is the flavor! How much flavor! In my search of the ever stronger, ever more bitter, I’ve come full circle to this old reliable to realize what a perfect beer. Light, but full of flavor.

Body is full of bubbles and is a dark orange with hints of yellow. High clarity. Looks great so far.  Nose is bready, caramel, subtle notes of citrus and pine. Pretty distinguishable aromas. Somewhat straight forward, but hey it’s a pale. Smells good, as it always does.  Flavor is maybe a touch of pine, not any citrus, malts are pretty muted as well. As with the last Sierra Nevada, somewhat flavorless. Still carbonated at the time the of first sip, and using a different glass, so maybe their quality has just gone down. Nothing bad, just boring.  Carbonation is holding at about medium, though I’m trying to drink it somewhat quickly in leu of all the nucleation. Body is definitely on the lighter side. Pretty damn dry, hops balance it out well in that regard, though there is not a lot of maltiness to begin with. Bitterness is surprisingly noticeable considering how little flavor there is, yay early hop additions. Good mouthfeel, dryness is a little much at times though, and could be a tad more refreshing.  Drinkability is high, that’s not the issue here.  Appearance turned out wonderful, retention was wonderful and lacing was thick.  Overall, idk, I regard this beer as a very good go to, but this is perplexing. The last SN was creeping up on flat and that effected a lot of things, not so much here. In this case it could simply be that I’m used to a newer style of pale and IPA, this is probably more old school now that I take a second to think about it, so is it inherently worse?

140,276,Lanas,3.62,"I was very curious how this famous beer it taste and was little exciting before drink it.. Also it has one awesome label outside and your imagination flying. Anyway the aroma remind me a lot the ""Belgium Pauwel Kwak"" beer and also little the colour.. The taste was something between ""Lager"" and some ""Belgium"" beer in the aftertaste.. The first mouthfeel was slightly bitter and remind you a lot ""Lager"" beers and the aftertaste was very malty and remind some ""Belgium"" beers like ""Leffe Blond"" and ""Pauwel kwak"".. This combination little trouble me but definitely i enjoy that beer despite is not my style.. I like more sweet beers and less bitter.. Overall a very refreshing and good all around beer to drink but can't touch the stadards of some ""Belgium"" and ""German"" beers out there..",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

About 2 years ago I tried Sierra Nevada. Now its my go to pale ale. It pours dark orange brown, has a thick white head with lacing. Has a slightly heavy mouth feel with lots of balanced hop flavor.

140,276,Mindcrime1000,4,"Poured from a bottle into a standard tap glass.  Pours nearly crystal clear bronze with an outstanding foamy head, great retention and excellent lacing.  Malts, hops, and grains all swirl around the nose in well-balanced and equal measures.  The brew hits the tongue with a slightly sweet and spicy malt flavor. The mid-palate enjoys spicy grainy yeast. The finish is a nice, earthy dry hop note. Overall, a well-balanced, restrained flavor.  The feel is medium-light to medium, with excellent carbonation and a nice drying finish.  This was one of the first craft beers I ever tried, many years ago. This is the first time I've had one in 10 years. It still stands up. APA's can be ""shy"" on flavor. Not this classic. It may lack some of the nuance of more recent offerings, but this is one of the most well-balanced brews I've had.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,WYeates,4.18,Pours to a pale amber color with a light head. Aroma is light and contains pine snd citrus notes.  The flavor is of grass and spice with a crisp after taste.  Sierra Nevada is a famtastic brewery and this is currently my favorite American Pale Ale.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,SierraNevallagash,4.24,"12oz bottle - dated 03/05/19 - poured into a Spiegelau-style IPA glass at 45F  Pours a bright copper hue, nearly crystal clear, with about two fingers of very off white head, which possesses impressive retention, never fully dissipating to less than a full cap, and leaving a perfect ring of clingy lace behind. Fine ascending streams of effervescence are visible.  Nose: A hefty base of caramel malt is apparent on the nose. Slightly sweet, slightly toasty, crisp, and warm. Among the malt, a generous dose of Cascade hops waft up, with aromas of grapefruit, lemon, pine resin, pear, and perhaps even a note of sweet ripe mango. There is no earthiness, but rather a green element to the nose that evokes images of a forest. Lots of floral notes as well, including lilac, hyacinth, and Easter lilly.  Palate: Like the nose, the first sip unfolds with caramel malt. Semi-sweet, slightly toasty, and crisp, with notes of caramel, fresh bread, and toffee. Hops cut in rather late, bringing mostly pine sap, spring florals, cedar, and some citrus character. There is less of a grapefruit note than one might imagine with a beer like this. Cascade hops are not like Citra. They are piney, resinous, and sort of ""woodsy"". In fact, I would say the citrus notes in this beer are far closer to lemon than grapefruit. Only upon swallowing do the hops really overtake the malt, with a gentle bitterness showing up in the finish, amd the flavour profile becoming drier and more resinous. Still, well after the finish, the aforementioned caramel malt sweetness is still detectable in small doses around the palate.  Mouthfeel/Body: The beer is medium bodied, crisp in nature, but the caramel malt provides a soft, slick, slightly chewy feel to it. For a pale ale, it certainly has some respectable weight to it, and a really employable softness. Effervescence is lively and plentiful, and also incredibly fine, almost champagne-like. Still, while the beer is crisp and drinkable, and although it has a fairly low ABV, I don't think I would want to drink more than 24oz in one sitting. This is one where the weight of the malt may creep up on you.  Overall: Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is a classic. It's an old school, West Coast staple. Each of us have most likely consumed gallons of this stuff by this point, and there is a very good reason for that. It is a stellar beer. It's a no-frills, simple, easy, highly polished hoppy ale that does not demand one's attention with complexity, while remaining incredibly flavour-saturated, and never boring. It is a perfect default beer that most can agree on. It's affordable, it's tasty, it's incredibly consistent, and the quality is top notch. It won't win any awards for exotic hops or complex tropical fruit notes, but it does everything you want it to do and more, and for that, it really is one of the greatest pale ales on the market.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,jrc1093,4.22,"Bottled on 3/5/19  Pours a clear golden orange-copper topped with a few fingers of tightly-composed white foam; great retention that trickles its way down to a thick, frothy cap while leaving layers of webby lacing following to the bottom of the glass.  Aroma hits with smooth, semi-sweet caramel malt upfront, eventually giving way to deep pine, herbal hops, red grapefruit, and orange zest developing in that order; a potent and drying bouquet.  Taste shows crisp caramel malts balanced with sharp piney hops and a touch of citrusy grapefruit on the back end; hints of wild berries develop fervently around/on the swallow.  Mouthfeel has a light, crisp body reinforced with fluffy, drying carbonation; brief heft on the mid-palate serves only to guide this one to a new height, an immensely satisfying dryness tinged with a faint, bitter hoppiness; for a pale ale, this is about as good as it gets.  A seminal pale ale for a reason, it holds up with its incredible malt-hop harmony and dynamic simplicity; it does alot without ever abandoning its easy-drinking nature.

The head sticks around for a while before diminishing into a hefty lace.  Smell - Grapefruit and a breezy pine air out of this one. Gentle and caring, this smell lures you into its safe nest.  Taste - Immediately noticeable is the sweet and mild malty backbone, but that transitions quickly to a fragrant herbal bitterness. The taste lingers pleasantly for just long enough.  Feel - Perfect body, perfect carbonation. A nice creamy feel. Incredibly easy to drink.  Overall - Everybody already knows this, but SNPA is the quintessential craft beer. You can find it everywhere, and it's a welcoming and forgiving flavor.

You can smell the cascade hops, but they're not overpowering. Taste: The taste follows the nose quite well. The hops are there but not overpowering and there is a strong malty sweet backbone.

140,276,defunksta,3.97,"Appearance: Pours a deep orange, slightly amber color with a rich orange hue. Mostly clear. A strong off-white head. Beautiful, and this is what an American pale ale should look like. (4.50).  Aroma: Remarkably light on the aroma. Orange nectar, pine soap, caramel, nectarine, peach, orange, grapefruit, lemon fruit zest, with a little pine. Some caramel and toffee underneath. Maybe some lemon dish soap, peach suds, and honey malt comes through. Attenuated and repeatedly less than I expect. Again and again disappointed by the aroma. (3.75)  Flavor: Clean but spicy and soapy orange, grapefruit, lemon citrus and pine soap flavor that mixes with caramel and honey malts. Decent, but relatively mild bitterness. Uniquely, the flavors are well-mixed. They all come at the same time providing one uniform flavor. Nectarine suds with soap? Compared to other SN beers the fruitiness is lighter/airier and less resinous, bitter pine that allows the fruit to shine. The flavor isn't great but the historical quality and balance is respected. (4.00)  Feel: The mouthfeel is moderate. Bitter, but balanced with malts and leaves a clean finish on the palate. (4.00)  Compared to Revolution's Fist City, more of a dry, bitter finish. Less fruit & citrus. More of a lingering spicy mouthfeel. Less flavor overall and just more spiciness. This one is predominately spicy and bitter forward. Much less flavor. Definitely your west-coast style, but lacks the aroma and flavor I desire.  to Three Floyd's Alpha King: This one has a more of an old school grapefruit and pine flavor. Much less dark tropical flavors. Much more smooth, clean, and some would say balanced.  to SN 40th Anniversary Ale 3/4/20: Similar appearance. Much less aroma and flavor. Less citrus, dank herbs, and pineapple.  w/ Summit's Extra Pale Ale 11/16/20: Pours a near identical color. Milder aromas. More caramel, orange citrus and soap. Less orange vegetable and flower. Less smooth and malty. A stronger bitterness.  to Boulevard's Pale Ale 6/2/20: Pours a similar color with a slightly stronger head. Stronger flavors of spicy citrus, caramel, and bitterness. Less applesauce, toffee, and marmalade. Slightly heavier bodied and sweeter.  to Celebration 11/23/20: Pours a lighter color. More orange peel, citrus soap. Less spicy caramel/orange and pien. A lighter body with more citrus hops. Cleaner. 3/15/22: Milder aromas. More candied orange citrus. Less spiced pine.  to their Oktoberfest 2020: Pours a darker color with a much stronger head. Stronger aromas of pine soap and sap. Less caramel and bread spice. More bitterness and less sweetness overall, however very similar. The Oktoberfest is only a maltier version of the pale ale. 12/14/20: Pours a darker color. More pine soap and orange citrus. Less sweetened orange/french toast. More bitter and clean overall.  to SN Oktoberfest 2021: Pours a lighter color. Stronger aromas. More orange and pine soap. Less toast, brown bread.  to New Glarus Moon Man No Coast Pale Ale 4/6/21: Slightly darker. Very similar. More citrus, pine, and herbal quality. Less tangerine and juicy stonefruit. A stronger bitterness. Quite similar.  to SweetWater 420 Pale Ale 6/2/21: More resinous orange, soap, pine, caramel. Less juicy, candied orange, lemon/pineapple sweetness. Darker.  to Fulton Pale Ale Project #1 8/2/21: Stronger malts. Larger and sweeter. Less peach tea and herbs.  Two head-to-head comparisons of the classic label and the Retro Label 8/10/20: Very similar. The classic label: More orange nectar aromas and slightly more bitter orange citrus. The retro label: More pine soap and suds. Less orange flavor. 10/19/20: Classic (3 month old): More orange citrus hop flavor and bitterness. Less tart citrus Retro (6 month old): More flat citrus with tartness. Winner: The classic SN label (although it's also a month or two more fresh.  4-way battle 9/20/21 Three Floyd's Gumball Head: Has the most American orange hoppiness. A strong malty body makes it drink like a pale ale. Summit EPA: Has the flowery and pine and chewy soapy orange flavor Sierra Nevada Oktoberfest 2021: Has the most sweet orange and rich toasty malt flavor. Similar to EPA but slightly more toasted. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale: Has orange, pine soap, and a caramel malt body. Less of a malt body.  Overall: This is the old-school west-coast style pale ale. Grapefruit, orange nectar and pine-soap hops that is appropriately balanced by malts. Doesn't finish bitter. Doesn't finish sweet. The ultimate balance of old-school American hops. Finishes so smooth. The rating here is lower because it's too basic for 2020. Yet, the flavor is quality. The historical semblance rescues the rating, but it's not something you'll find on the shelves. Compared to our palates now, this is surprisingly weaker in flavor and aroma, but the respect is not diminished. It has a uniform flavor and will always remain the standard, and that is quite an achievement. (Current Rating: 3.97)",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Taste starts lightly bitter with toasty malt character. The middle opens up to a more crackery malt note with, with the hop flavors opening up to present dried citrus and floral notes. The finish opens up more of the bitterness and just slightly dries the mouth, making you want another sip. There is a sweetness that rides throught the entire sip that is never overpowering.  The mouthfeel is the slightest bit aqueous, but not so much that it's a turn off. The carbonation is right where it needs to be for an APA (this is THE APA, so it's expected.  Overall, you really can't go wrong with Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. It's the one of the standard APAs that every beer drinker has had at least once, and it's always pleasant to go back to it.

All this beer is, is a near perfect display of simplicity and quality. With the exception of a few rotating local brews I cycle in, this is my go-to when eating dinner or just relaxing after work.  With the already abundant collection of reviews, I'd rather skip the formality and just talk about my favorite part: The hoppy, ""spicy"" bite at the end. To me, this truly does set this pale ale apart from others. Some are too smooth and don't have enough attitude, but this has a perfect punch. Nice smooth beginning, citrus and light hoppy notes, and then, the moment that makes you want more. A slightly dry finish into a tantalizing sightly bitter, fairly hoppy, and perfectly spicy ending.

140,276,Bsimpson91,5,"Wow! Wonderful tasty delightful ale! Exceptional in every thing. Looks nice, I love the presentation. Looks like a classic and iconic beer. The aroma is a blast of brightness, grapefruit citrus with light hints of malt. Smells like a summer day when all the kids on the block have a fruity ice pop or snow cone. The taste is where it gets good. Wonderful top end sweetness that leads straight into those American citrusy hop notes. Grapefruit lingering around with a backbone of malt. The finish is semi dry with hop bite bitterness in the end. That semi dryness leads you to want another sip. Over the time drinking, the hops begin to build, making the beer rich and feeling very satisfied. The feel is light to medium with a bit of body. The carbonation is medium.

Malty flavours rather biscuit-y. Some alcohol as well, but subdued enough. Probably the most textbook I've ever drunk. Feel: medium to light body with still a touch of silkiness. Warmth from the alcohol without burning. Classic. Overall: It may not shock and awe. Most probably, if you're an user of this site it won't. Yet it's got everything and doesn't miss much else.

On one hand, the hoppy, fruity, and piney aromas and first sips make the drinker immediately aware that this beer has piggy-backed off of a trend towards more unnecessary hop action while a fine beer hides underneath. Such a move pacifies the beer hipsters, no doubt, but this beer is, fortunately, worthy of more praise than simply acknowledgement over the adequate execution of a trend.

Very old school, other end of the spectrum from a lot of hoppy pale ales these days. Slightly more spicy notes. There is a prevalent funkiness in the yeast or something that is not found in a lot of pale ales or IPAs these days (except Belgian ones obviously). I honestly didn't get much fruit, pine, or other hop notes.  Mouthfeel is medium, pretty refined feeling, good bitterness.  Overall, more bready and malty than I'm looking for in pale ale.

140,276,Beers-es,4.19,"My first truly great American beer, which I originally came across in Northern California in the mid-80s. Found some reasonably fresh bottles at the Safeway and realized I'd never reviewed it.  Pours a clear deep gold. Three fingers of foam creates the definitive ""dense and rocky head."" Good lacing.  Smell is initially fresh pine resin and sweet citrus, which gives way to more earthy and floral notes. Taste follows, with a pleasantly bitter finish. Feel has substance for the ABV but super drinkable.  This beer was radically amazing 30 years ago. Now it's a fine classic.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

The smell just invites a large sip. T: Not citrus like you would expect from the aroma. Pine, orange zest, grass. O: An good offering from a stellar brewery. Well put together pale ale. I enjoy the faint citrus taste with the dry, hop finish. One could wish for a larger selection of Sierra Nevada beers to make it into Ontario.

Good beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,PlinyMeNow,3,"Well. The classic pale ale, the one that started it all, I get it. Craft, yet mass produced and widely available at a good price point, I get it. The goal posts keep moving. We have APAs hopped like IPAs, IPAs that taste like DIPAs, DIPAs made to knock you unconscious. You go back to this one and what do you get? An underwhelming amber colored ale with a faint aroma of citrusy hops and bready/grainy malt, a bitter, dry taste with some balancing sweetness, medium body, and a short slightly bitter finish. Maybe I'm just hooked on the current trends, but for now I'm enjoying the ride. Returning to this classic is jarring.

Best before date: 16.09.2017  Look: The beer pours a clear medium amber with 4cm of off-white head that fades into a partial film in 2+ minutes.  Aroma: Faint intensity even after warming. Some citrusy, piney hops with balancing pale malts. A bit soapy. Lackluster.  Taste: Same as the aroma, nothing to add. The finish is short, faint, and bitter.  Feel: Medium body with lively carbonation. Crisp.  Overall: It's never a good sign if I'm in the middle of a review and I get distracted and start doing other stuff. It happened with this beer and I came back to finish what I started at room temperature.

Moderate bitterness and moderate, grainy sweetness. Medium body, watery, medium high carbo. Salty. Long bitter finish bit astringent. Perfumy alcohol.

Piney aromas after it warms.  Taste is much more fruity: lime, citrus. Mango? A bit peppery and spicy, sweet. Apples too. Alcohol is very present but doesn't blend in very well. Slightly bitter aftertaste. Honey.  Very light carbonation. Kinda heavy.  Interesting. It's sweeter than most APA's I'm used to, but not overbearingly so. All in all, it's a bit stiff: it tastes nice, but it's a bit ""dense"", if that makes any lick of sense to you. Nothing really pops, it's a bit too uniform.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,Lone_Freighter,4,"When I want an APA that is easy going and easy to find and not watered down by some company that doesn't care about beer (like AB). This is what I reach for. Pours a nice light semi-golden color yielding a one finger white head in my pint glass. Foamy speckled lacing graces the sides of the glass nicely. The smell is centered around some spicy yet grassy sweet hops, malts only slightly come out as the beer warms. Same as the taste, the palate is moderately carbonated with bitter aftertaste and finish. Overall, good for style and good for me.  This may be a simple one, but it's an APA and I don't expect it to be in the same ring as Heady Topper, a Crooked Stave Sour or even Deschutes' The Abyss. I think most people get my point if they're reading this.

The color is a medium cloudy straw, because some yeast is left in the bottle. The aroma is a slight piney citrus. The taste is a distinct piney crispness with light notes of citrus. Bitterness is moderate toward the middle to back of the palate with a hint of malt which offers a smooth finish.

I've enjoyed this beer both as draft as well as bottled. My review delves mostly into my experience drinking from the bottle. The color is a dark cloudly straw, owing to the bottle conditioning that leaves some yeast in each bottle. A creamy head lingers. The smell is fairly subdued, giving off more hints of citrus than Cascade hops. The taste however makes up for this by asserting the crispness of the hops which are complemented by light notes of citrus. Bitterness is mild to moderate due to the beer's maltiness which offers a smooth finish. As mentioned before, this is my go-to pale which I find can be enjoyed on nearly any occasion.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,monkist,4.93,"Craft beer taught me that drinking beer is no longer just an alcoholic pastime but an experience of body and mind, even more than reading a book or watching a film: as our bodies are comprised of mostly fluids, the liquid we intake will become a part of us and change our constitution for a short while. Craft beers are well known of their selected and high quality ingredients and the mastery of their brewing. Brewmasters are like artists who compose a masterpiece by putting the right amount of ingredients together and combining them in the right way to achieve a unique brew, outstanding taste, smell, feel - and nonetheless, experience. I am convinced that when we drink a masterfully brewed craft beer, our impression is different based on the type and amount of ingredients, let alone how and where they have been made or grown. Sierra Nevada has shown me that an unparalleled greatness exists in the art of master brewing by creating a true experience in a bottle: their own, one and only Pale Ale. I am not an advocate of uncontrolled substances but I must admit that having had a pint of this Pale Ale I was overwhelmed by the great Nature of the Californian woods and mountains of the Sierra Nevadas, the foothills of the Rockies. I felt for the first time in my life that the Cascade hops grown in Californian soil and raised by the sun and rain of that microclima convey an experience through the natural water, grains and yeast of California, as if I were there if I closed my eyes, as if I could feel its wind on my skin, could smell the air of the Pacific or of the depth of the shadowy forests and could even hear the rustling of the trees, the gurgling of a nearby stream... as if that scenery on the label has come alive. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is such a psychedelic beer. When you drink it, you intake nature in its purest form and you travel through time and space to re-live something wonderfully natural. A masterpiece in brewing beer, a perfect harmony of tastes and a depth like no other. This is a must for all BeerAdvocate. This is the Alpha and Omega of (American) craft brewing IMHO.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

They've been pumping this pale ale out for decades now and they have established themselves as a leader in brewing industry.  I didn't like this beer the first time I tried it (18-19). That's the thing about it: you get used to it. It has so many flavors going on at once that it can be difficult to understand for noobie beer-drinkers. Eventually you'll find a new flavor to enjoy every time you take a sip. I simply have yet to find a pale ale that is as consistent, delicious, and reliable as Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. I personally associate it with many great Northern California memories over the past 15 years.  Get one ridiculously ice cold, pour it into a frozen beer glass, and enjoy on the hottest summer day of the year. I'm sure you won't be disappointed.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Lorenzai_Konstantinov,3.95,"Poured from bottle, 1.5 finger head with significant lacing. Hazy light brown almost bronze colour. The smell is of straight up cascade hops and a little bit of acidity. The smell translates directly into flavor, with the cascade hops up front on the palette. There is a citrus almost lemon-lime element present, and a weak malt backbone is also present but doesn't add much for balance or sweetness. As it warms it seems to get more bitter. My bottle did not have very significant carbonation, which I found slightly strange since I've had this beer plenty of times before and it did. Maybe someone shook the bottle. YMMV with that. Mouthfeel was as you'd expect a pale ale to be otherwise, a little on the thin side. Overall this is one of my go to beers when I'm looking for something a little more hoppy. It's flavor is heavily skewed towards hops over the malt and makes a nice change of pace without completely obliterating your taste buds like a full on IPA does. The 37 IBU rating seems low.

The taste followed along, with a bit of bitterness up front, then the hops come in with the floral, milder than expected resin, then a bit if brightness from the citrus that seems more orange or tangerine than the usual grapefruit.

They're fantadtic representations of their respective styles produced in high enough volume to make them widely available at a fair price without resorting to gimmicks.

While it has inspired countless breweries to start a hops and IBU arms race, Pale Ale is here to stay for what you go back to when you want a taste of perfection. Not only is it the benchmark for taste, but also price and availability. If service is the rent we pay for living, Pale Ale is the rent Sierra Nevada pays to the world of beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,hreb,3.37,"12oz pkgd 09/07/16. Pint glass. Brassy orange color, moderate white head, crystal clear as SN is want to do. Piny and citrusy hop aroma, which could easily be an IPA. Flavor comes through strong with that same one-dimensional hop sharpness, but finishes with a biscuit malt aftertaste of toasted grain and a hint of caramel. But the bitter and sweet flavors don't work together and compliment each other. Rather, the malt flavor only serves to disqualify this beer from being a hoppy, West coast IPA.  As a pale ale I find this beer to be a failure, and as an IPA, it's just not very good. I deeply regret this this beer has become a benchmark for American Pale Ale, because I think there are some great APAs, and they don't taste anything like this one. I would much prefer this beer broken down into its components and served to me as separate ales: the aroma, bitterness, malt body, and color are all fine, but don't belong together in the same glass.  I do think this beer may be better in a fresh bottle than on tap.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

The smell features grass, pine needles, floral hops, and a whiff of citrus. The taste opens with a nice malt base with grapefruit and a blast of bitter hops. It is super dry and crisp. It's moderately carbonated and with a 5.6% ABV it's very easy to drink. There's a reason this is considered a classic: it's consistently well-crafted, tasty, and refreshing.

140,276,Benjolovesbeer,5,"This is by far the best pale ale I can think of, sure there are better beers, better Sierra Nevada's, and better IPA's but this is a pale ale and only 2 beers come to mind and that is Rolling Rock and Sierra Nevada. Rolling Rock used to compare when it was brewed by Latrobe but now it's brewed by Annheiser Busch and is awful. Sierra Nevada stays true to its roots and now brews the only delicious pale ale I can think of. Not to mention it is the beer that got me into IPA's, took me,away from commercial beers, first to inform me there are better brews out there , and it is Sierra Nevada's signature. An American classic. Although better straight out of the bottle this time poured into a tulip: Look: golden with a fluffy head. Aroma: pine and citrus. Feel: medium, malty, and hoppy.

The body is light to medium and the finish is semi-dry. Overall it’s a crisp and refreshing beer. The hoppiness is quite restrained compared to many other APAs that I’ve had (especially from California), but when this first came out I’m sure it was considered pretty hoppy.

Orange, golden colour, almost like an Oktoberfest. Aroma off the bat, metallic, much like Yuengling Lord Chesterfield, or maybe thats cause I just read my review of that one, smell again..no, definitely metallic, but not off putting. Dry, Its been awhile, but the piney notes I dont really find anymore. More of a dry hop, dry malt, biscuit taste. Light easy drinking beer.

Nice lacing sticks to the sides. Microbubbles are streamy and effervescent. It just looks like a nice beer from a nicely-designed bottle.  S - In putting my nose to the glass, it's not as strong, or overpowering, as I'd expected. Slight piney hop, bready malt, toffee, citrus rind. Typical of most pale ales I've drank.  T - Very balanced between hops and malts, just the right amount of bittersweet. Starts out with a strong citrus/pine hop bite. Malty biscuit sweetness and citrus fruit follows. A perfect balance of bitter hops and malty sweetness with some spice.  F - Light-to-medium bodied, moderate carbonation, almost drinks like a light beer but very smooth and drinkable.  O - Have had this on tap and in bottles and cans. Still one of my favorites, just now having one and rating it in honor of late musician Elliott Smith's birthday (he drank it/liked it).

Once done it's not unpleasant just a generic tamed hoppiness between the citrus fruit (lemon-grapefruit) and pine needle domains.

The taste is overwhelmingly that of gritty, chewy pilsner, even slightly candied, grains and almost absent of what was expected in the aroma.

Smell: 3.75 Not very aromatic, but you can make out malt, hops, slightly tart fruit, citrus.  Taste: 4.5 Slight hop bitterness at first. Almost to an IPA level of hop bitterness. Quickly kicks into savory spices, citrus, peach, and mango. Its slightly sweet, but then dries out abruptly. Maltier and darker than expected (for something listed as a pale ale). Goes a bit to the bitter side on the tail end and hop flavors turn up the intensity.  Feel: 4 Right on the edge of light, but teetering on the medium bodied side. Feels a bit thin when the carbonation dies out.  Overall: 4.25 Great beer. Better than I expected. I have heard about S.N.’s Pale Ale and, since listed as a Pale Ale, I had stayed away from it. I tend to not like light Pilsners or Pale Ales, but this brew is better than a lot of IPAs that I have had. It is hoppier and maltier than I expected and very flavorful.

Good, if moderate, visible effervescence; nice golden-brown limpidity; solid head and superb lacing. Spicy notes of green-peppercorn and wet thyme floating upon an undercurrent of grapefruit juice and orange-rind; the malt expresses subtle sweet aromas, as well, but in the hopped mix these are transmuted to impressions of sticky citric sugars, like some sort of lemon-infused rock-candy. Refreshing flavors, never overwhelmed by this pale ale's medium-plus mouthfeel: more juiciness, with notes of grapefruit, lemon, d'Anjou pear, and pineapple, all of which is underwritten by a smooth, golden-malty texture, and all of which gives way to some malt-husk and herbaceous, thyme-hop bite.

Very likable, very approachable, rich without being heavy, spicy without being too spicy, just a beautifully balanced group of flavors which manage to be complex yet simple at the same time. Lingering aftertaste with just a bit of hop bite inviting another drink.  I would say full texture which strikes me as solid yet not weighty.

Taste, just heaven, hoppy, yet a sturdy malt bill providing caramel backbone. Hop flavor is plenty of forest, grapefruit. A delicious bitter edge remains through the entire mouthfeel. A darker citrus edge throughout. Barely sweet malt presence that is smooth while the hops provide bitterness, and an almost Magnum hop like spice edge to it.  The absolute classic American pale ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,EnzoDamario,4.37,"I'm a big fan of happy beers. Aroma instantly got my attention. Cascades hops do their Job. Not impressed by the appearance, looks like a standard APA. Tastes just as it smells, great happy sensation but not over bitter. Carbonated to the right point, it produces a nice mouthfell. Nor dense neither watery.... nice bubbling. Very drinkable and refreshing. Aftertaste is asome. An excellent beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,MusaJames,3.56,Right away I like the look. Much darker than I had expected doesn't develop a giant head. Hops are the only thing I notice when I smell as my nose isn't the best at these things. Once I start drinking it starts really refreshing with a lingering bitterness. I'm not a giant fan of hoppy beers but this one manages to win me over. The only thing that I don't care for is the lingering bitterness. Having said that it isn't a big deal. Sierra Nevada Pale ale is a beer I've seen all over the place and haven't given its day in court for some time. I now understand its popularity is well earned.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,Beginner2,3.98,"A well put-together ale. But do not take it from me, take it from the experts.  MJ's 1999 ""Guide"" gave it 4 of 4 stars (very rare) and said ""it has a teasing balance between the piney Juniper-tasting Cascade hops and the fruitiness of the top-fermenting yeast."" Listed in the ""1001"", this classic deserves to be there and craft brewing would be different today were it not for this Pale Ale's offering a tasty alternative so early and making so much of the craft market. (Reviewed by Randy Mosher.) Reviewed also and favorably in Roger Protz' CAMRA classic ""300 Beers To Try Before You Die!""  5/23/21 Had again on my return to the Bay Area where I lived 1977-1986. Fitting. And I should not wait so long to revisit a classic. I have had 18 unique SN's, so my mini-review is redundant and needs no additions. I will keep count over @ UnTappd. But my one-sentence micro-review is what everyone knows: SN was a pioneer, they were the first generation of crafters and they stayed true... always experimenting and improving and expanding.

Orange citrus, pine, and light grapefruit. On the light side of medium bodied. Crisp but smooth. Light malt lays down the base on the palate with a balancing bitterness and pine-rubbed orange. Finishes fairly dry and quick with fading citrus.  The first I had this beer I was blown away by it's bright citrus and solid bitterness but after years of palate shift, it just comes off mild and average.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Raidersox,4.74,"Packaged on 6/2/15, old I know but was in a hurry and grabbed a 12 pack of a trusted brew. Chilled to 38 degrees, poured into large wine glass.  Look: Hazy gold orange with 1/2 inch off white head that dissipated quickly leaving a ring of foam and light lacing. Good carbonation.  Smell: Overtones of citrus (orange and tangerine), spice and a light pine resin.  Taste: Citrus and pine hops balanced by a light malt sweetness. Spiced Dry finish. Lightly grassy aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied and well carbonated, sharp.  Overall: Despite the age of this sample I was pleasantly surprised. This is a very drinkable pale ale but I want to try a fresher bottle and compare this review to the new one. This deserves a second look to see if the legend of this brew holds up.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

This is truly the bench mark for American style pale ales. Beautiful colour. Wonderful smell. Even better taste. Very refreshing and hoppy! At first I must admit I thought I was drinking an IPA. And at 5.6% ABV this is truly a remarkably balanced beer. I've been searching for similar products but cannot find anything comparable. A++ for this one.  We have this available in bottles in Canada (at the LCBO in Ontario) however it's pretty pricy at $15 for a 6 pack! None the less, I always keep a few in the fridge. I only wish they would bring Sierra Nevada's Torpedo IPA to the LCBO!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Malty sweetness, along with a hint of biscuit, citric and piney flavors, hoppy bitterness. A very balanced beer, all the flavors are blended in perfectly. Long finish. Medium to light body, smooth.

A hint of citrus is in there as well. It seems rather subdued, and standard. Taste is a range of slightly sweet malts, balanced out with some citrusy hops. Nice balance and contrast between the two. Mouth feel is nice and smooth. A little mouth coating, which is great. It really feels good. Overall, wow. A very good pale ale right here. I'll be returning to this one, I can tell. Highly recommended!  Served in a 12oz snifter.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Lingenbrau,5,"Nothing I need to say that anyone here doesn't know already.  When you see SNPA, you know what you're looking at. When you smell it, it takes you back to when you first got into craft, when it was a true fight for the little guy. It smells like a friggin Pale Ale.  The taste, the feel of SNPA, it's unmistakable. Citrus. Pine. Crisp. Bold. Bitter. The beer that people used to say, ""It's too bitter!"". The beer that slapped the world in the face and said I don't give a F#*!, here is an American Pale Ale, and Sierra Nevada stood by it. And here we are all these years later, still comparing pales to SNPA. Respect.  This is THE classic example and maybe the platform of the style.

140,276,SheaDawg,4.57,"Don't drink it ""ice"" cold. That's not the way to enjoy it. It should be really cold, but not as cold as you can possibly get it. To bring out the light citrus taste and basic (as apposed to acidic) taste, you need to drink it at the right temperature. It has a very light feel to what many would believe to be a heavy beer.

Halfway between a lager and a brown in color, the flavor balances quite a bit more to bitter than malt. Other than the bitterness, I don't get much flavor from the hops.

I really like the color of this brew, nice and deep. There is also a nice amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is rich with hops and mild earthy grains and malts. Just the smell of this brew is really inviteing. You really pick up on the hops , in the smell of this brew. To me the hop smell is just right, for this brew . Now for the taste, it is bold with flavors. You pick up the hops at first the the smoothness of earthy grains and malts. I like how this brew is bitter at first the smooth at the end. There is a lot going on in Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. This brew has a super nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering about it. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale has a real nice smoothness to it. This is on of the more bolder but smoother, tasting pale ale's I have had. This is a nice smooth and refreshing drinking brew. The mouthfeel of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, is hoppy, rich, bold , clean, smooth and refreshing. This is a brew that I would buy if I was looking for a pale ale to drink on the daily.

Smell was lemony, faint sweetness like honey, and a little bit of something pepper-y/spicy. The taste was similar with a refreshing finish, overall really balanced between malt and hop with neither dominating.

Smell: Citrus and piney hops, beautifully balanced with the bready malt. I remember the first time I tried this beer, it seemed overwhelming to me. Times have changed, and there are many beers out there more intense, but this is still amazing.  Taste: Just like the smell. Excellent balance of malt and hops. Significant hop flavour with pine and citrus in the foreground.  Feel: Medium body, enough to grab on to but light enough to enjoy many of them.  Overall: There is a reason this is a classic.

TASTE: Sweet and bitterness are nicely balanced here. Mild citrus and pine notes, this beer came in a winter variety pack and the beer is exactly three months past the bottling date. Probably would be a bit more flavorful if newer, same with aroma. But that is what is available. MOUTHFEEL: Medium light body, not overly dry, not overly slick...in the middle. Perfect carbonation to this beer, prickly on tongue. OVERALL: I think a super fresh bottle would pop a bit more, but this is still a great tasting brew.

S: Tangy tangerine, lime, and grapefruit, along with some soft bready malt character topped with sharp pine and some mild floralness.  T: Like the smell, sour citrus, except more heavy on the grapefruit; pine is still prominent, though not super bitter, and the malt is left as more of an aftertaste, although it is a nice one. The hoppiness is not too intense; good for newcomers to the pale ale world.  F: It's a shame it's a bit thin (and well, a tad lacking delicious hops and malt) or this would be a great beer.

Paired with last night's Mexican leftovers.  Look: Pours a nice medium copper color with some haze. Large bubbles in the head, but it quickly dissipated, leaving just a few bubbles hanging out around the edges.  Smell: Strong bready malt notes, with a honey explosion. I'm not getting much hoppiness, maybe it's a bit too old (almost 4 months since bottling). The smell isn't that enticing.  Taste: While the hops were lacking in the smell, they show up in the taste, lending a noticeable bitterness to balace and offset the sweet honey smell.  Feel: Medium carbonation, a little watery but also sticky at the same time.  Overall: Given its legacy and reputation, I can't knock this beer too much. It still stands up well to the legion beers that derived from its template.

The look was a nice dark amber, thick head, and very good lacing down the glass. The scent of ""whole cone hops"" was distinct and it was quite aromatic. I was a bit disappointed with the carbonation - or rather so much carbonation that the brew has.

140,276,Back_in_the_Saddle,3.99,"This was poured into a pint glass. Why? Oh yeah, its just an APA, people, why are we re-inventing the wheel, oh boy, well, here's the rest for the rookies using tekus, take your training wheels off guys. The appearance was a hazy pale burnt orange color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than a minute. Lacing was stringy and running here and there. The smell started off with sharp citrus rind with a light spicy character over top of a light biscuity malt base. The taste was bitter with the light spice sliding right on in and then a light sweetness from the malts. The mouthfeel was light bodied with a clear crisp sessionability about it. Carbonation hits the tongue nicely as an APA and allows the blend of the spice, bitterness of the hops and the malts to lay down sweet and bitter on my tongue. Overall, now that's an APA, folks. A crisp clear session that has proven itself to be a winner far and wide and a great food beer as well.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,Bonkinishwa,3.69,"Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. - Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. 5.6% ABV. 12oz bottle poured into snifter.  Look: Translucent golden color, with white lacing present.  Smell: Smells of fresh tropical fruit, hops, and pine.  Feel: Smooth and carbonated, balanced out.  Taste: Just like fresh tropical fruits, with some wheat and hop flavors throughout, and counteract each other nicely. The aftertaste is grainy, and reminded me of saltine crackers.  Overall: My first American Pale Ale style of beer. I usually stay away from IPA's, because of the high bitterness, but decided to try this, to get introduced into the style of bitter beers. I was pleased by how it wasn't overly bitter, and how the ingredients weren't covered by it. I did enjoy it, and am eager to try some more of the same style.

140,276,Libeertarian,3.57,"A somewhat hazy bright copper with light tannish uneven foamy head. Medium retention. Lace and legs aren't worth mentioning. Oh wait, I just did. There's almost no smell to this. Caramel and resin if anything. More resin on the palate, but leaning towards herbal, brothy, or spicy even. Decent malt presence in terms of both grain and caramel, with a delightful vegetal and minimal iced-tea hop finish as well as expected peppercorn retro-olfaction. Superb balance. Medium-bodied, kind of watery, but oh so sudsy as it lingers. Fun to slosh between teeth and tongue. A good beer if I've ever had one. Also an overrated beer if I've ever had one. And I'm a huge fan of Sierra Nevada. Strong suits are definitely taste and feel, but even those are just on the high side of basic. The hops do most of the work here, even though they aren't very ""apparent."" You could add these same hops to a bottom-shelf English Pale (like Bass), and get more or less the same taste. Mind you, I'm not saying that's necessarily a bad thing. In any case, this mouthfeel is still far afield. Know this: was I to rate it on drinkability alone, it would garner a 5/5.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,911CROFT,3.55,"350ml bottle into a conical 2/3 pint glass. Paid £1.90 for a single bottle.  Pours a slightly hazy amber coloured body with plenty of fast rising visible carbonation. A thick, foamy, two-finger in height, white head slowly fades to a thin cap leaving thick bands of excellent sticky lacing.  The hop forward nose predominately consists of bold floral and pine aromas. Lighter notes of citrus fruit and spice are underpinned by an ample amount of soft bready malt. The taste mirrors the nose, leading with floral and sticky pine hop profiles followed by a touch of peppery spice. The soft, sweet bready backbone and a touch of caramel malt provide excellent balance throughout the mid palate and linger for an enjoyable length of time before smoothly fading as hops re-enter in the finish. In the mouth, the texture starts pleasantly smooth and creamy. The medium body, lifted by plenty of lively carbonation, is crisp, easy drinking, and refreshing but the finish becomes just a little too bitter and dry. Strong resinous pine and grapefruit flavours build, and a large amount of hop oils stimulate the palate with a prolonged, moderately bitter, slightly astringent sensation that is left to linger.  Overall this is a very good beer. With the exception of the aftertaste, which I found just a little too harsh, it is very well balanced and hugely drinkable, I much prefer this to Sierra Nevada’s Torpedo offering. I could certainly see myself trying it again in the future and would absolutely recommend it to someone with a slightly higher tolerance to that bitter pine hop profile than myself.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,Strat58cat,3.31,"This is a rough draft of a beer from a brewer that has developed into one of my favorites. Originating in 1980 as the original Sierra Nevada ale, Pale Ale notably did not conquer the world. Samuel Adams Boston Lager, in contrast, sort of did conquer the world. There's a good reason. Samuel Adams Boston Lager is a landmark beer - truly supreme to anything on the market in 1985, and to this day among the best beers available. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale - despite the great marketing, awesome art on the bottle, environmentalism, and quality ingredients - is only so-so. Of course, even though it's better, it couldn't conquer Budweiser. It's not even in the same ballpark as Boston Lager. I can see what they were trying to do with it - very clearly. They've realized their vision in other offerings since Pale Ale - for example, Torpedo and Nooner. Sierra Nevada makes fantastic beers - but this world-famous, historic ale isn't one of them.  I've never liked Sierra Nevada Pale Ale that much. I didn't like it that much when it was the new thing in the 1980s. I didn't like it that much when it was an established craft beer in the 1990s. I didn't like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale that much in the 2000s when it achieved ubiquity. I tried it again last night. I still don't like it that much. Look, I know it's famous. It's just so-so.  Ironically, the shortcomings of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale seem to have driven the brewery to greater and greater heights of achievement. Today, Sierra Nevada can go toe-to-toe with any brewer in the world for overall quality. They make delicious beers. In contrast, Samuel Adams has struggled even to approach, much less surpass, Boston Lager.  Sierra Nevada has a defining aesthetic. Torpedo is a terrific IPA. Nooner is a sublime pilsner. Traded-off one with the other, these two beers compliment each other and reach insane heights, since they share a common aesthetic. The initial emergence of that Sierra Nevada aesthetic in Pale Ale, however, is just a rough draft.  The look of Pale Ale is its strong suit. It's a deep amber, suggesting toasty notes from roasted malts. Like many craft beers today - but nothing like what was available in 1980 - Sierra Nevada Pale Ale froths up a tight head of white foam, and retains it. The head laces to the bottom of the glass. The color is a simple, deep amber, suggesting a simple but high-quality brew.  Sierra Nevada Pale Ale has an old-school aroma. This is no IPA. The smell of hops is strong in this one, but they are blandish, dank hops. At most, there's a bare hint of pine. The aroma is very similar to Firestone Walker Double Barrel Ale.  Sierra Nevada Pale Ale's taste is overwhelmingly toast. Although the hops lend the dank aroma just noted, the taste is not notably impacted. Instead, I get a bland toasty flavor. It's a simple flavor, similar to perhaps the toasty malt backbone of Lagunitas. However, unlike in Lagunitas, there's nothing else going on and it's ho-hum. To my taste buds, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale tastes like bland toast. Then, suddenly, the hops make their presence known with a dramatic hop bitterness. Bland yet suddenly and unpleasantly bitter is not what I personally look for in a beer. Objectively, SNPA is not actually that bitter. The IBU is 37, while a fellow craft landmark from 1985, Boston Lager, is 30. I immensely enjoy IPAs with IBUs more than double SNPA. A Firestone Walker pale ale - Pale 31 - is more bitter than SNPA, but it works brilliantly there. The problem in SNPA is the combination of flavors, which falls far short of delicious. The dank but unremarkable hops and bland toast don't set the stage for bitterness. As a result, SNPA's bitter flavor is unwelcome and unpleasant. A novice chef might create a dish that featured a dank aroma, a bland flavor, and then bitterness. That's pretty much what happened here . . . but wait. What's this? There's a hops note that comes in, after the bitterness. It hints of something remarkable. It hints of something terrific. Yes, that hops note has been expanded and turned into the delicious flavors of Sierra Nevada's more developed offerings, such as Torpedo and Nooner. Here, it saves the day. There's something special there after all, in the background. It's lurking behind a little too much boring dank hops aroma, and too much boring toast flavor, and too much unsupported bitterness. Yes, that special note has been turned into a symphony of spectacular flavors in later brews from Sierra Nevada. SNPA is a special beer, because it's the starting point for greatness. Put together, the flavors make for a so-so ale, but it is refreshing.  The feel of SNPA is solid. It's neither watery nor thick. Carbonation is medium as well. There's nothing amiss with the feel.  Sierra Nevada has accomplished tremendous brews. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is their first brew, but not nearly the best. It's a so-so beer that charted a course to later great beers.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

S - pine, pineapple, sugar, sweet malt, wet grains, very floral, baking yeast, fresh cut grass, a slight dank note. Smells like a perfect California day -- outside the cities of course.  T - pine, sugar, slight lager note, bittersweet malts, very grainy, crisp clean water, beautiful carbonation, dried tropical flowers, dried island fruits and perfectly hopped for a light, crisp yet flavorful pale ale.  M - medium body, perfectly balanced, wonderful complexity, medium plus carbonation, medium acidity and a wonderful sweet hop to sweet malt to bittersweet hop finish.  D/O - This beer is refreshing, crisp, taste, easy to drink, simple yet full of flavor -- a true masterly crafted ale for every beer/ale drinker.

140,276,muldersha,3.58,"Had from a 12oz brown glass bottle with a packaging date of 05/05/15. Purchased in Portland, OR  Pours a lightly hazy (but mostly clear) orange/amber color with a decent white head. Not very good retention and only a wispy lacing.  Orange and pine dominate the nose right out the gate. However, with a bit of agitation this brew really sings with boisterous aromas of orange zest, sweet orange juice, pine, white grape, Meyer lemon, Oro Blanco grapefruit, pomelo, oregano, green tea, Lemonheads candy, tangerine soda, buddleia flowers, mineral salts, and petrol. Almost like someone took a young, quality Mosel Riesling and mixed it with a West Coast IPA.  Unfortunately, I think my zealous agitation left the brew a little flat. It's medium-bodied, but lighter than expected. The flavor is also very sharp, peppery, herbal, and abruptly bitter. It felt a little thin and watery in the mid-palate. The finish is pretty weak with subtle peppery nuances of orange and bitter herbs.  I've had this beer hundreds of times, but I have to confess, I rarely really taste it. It definitely didn't taste like how I thought it was going to taste. It really opened up aromatically as it warmed a little, and it really needed that somewhat aggressive agitation to really open fully. It was also much thinner and lighter than I thought.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

I hate IPA's, and so I was hesitant to try a Pale Ale by a brewery famous for its' IPA's. Good god, I was wrong.  The beer pours a beautiful dark golden color, and smells very citrusy and piney. The taste is floral hops up front with a delicious crackery malt backbone. It has a lingering bitter aftertaste, which I like much more now than I used to.

140,276,mozart4898,4.15,"12 oz bottle poured to pint glass. Had it many times before, first time reviewing.  L - Deep golden color. Aggressive pour yields a 2 finger head which fades quickly to a ring around the pint glass. Slightly less than perfect clarity from a tiny bit of yeast from bottle conditioning. S - Bit of caramel sweetness with floral hops in the background. Not overly distinctive in any one aroma. T - Balance between malt and gentle hop bitterness with neither dominating. Again, hops show as more floral and possibly somewhat piney than the citrus usually associated with Cascade hops. F - Mouthfeel is spot on for my expectation of the style - perfect moderate carbonation, not too thin yet refreshing. O - SNPA probably seems underhopped to many hopheads today (myself included) but I can't fault a beer that's been around since I was born for staying true to its roots.

140,276,DabblinWiscCraft,3.83,"Picked up a six pack at my nearest gas station. The packaged on date states it was packed two months ago. Poured right from the fridge into my Red Eye pint glass.  L: Pours a clear medium-amber with about two inches of eggshell head that sticks around for a bit and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Healthy visible carbonation, along with just a bit of particulate floating around.  S: Caramel malts and a touch of pine hop presence in the nose, but these are quite subdued. Perhaps just a suggestion of diacetyl buttery notes, as well.  T: Cracker malt flavor at the front, with just a touch of sweetness. A bit of a bright peppery quality there, too. The middle introduces some pine hop notes, along with just a bit of citrus zest, though they aren't what I would call assertive. I'm picking up just a hint of diacetyl butterscotch in the mix here. The back end is where the hops kick in--they're much more assertive as bittering agents. The back retains the cracker malt flavor, but there's a good deal of resinous hop bitterness at the back.  F: On the lighter side of medium-bodied. This one is bright, smooth, and bitter in turns. Very nice level of carbonation.  O: It's been a good long while since I've picked up a pack of SN Pale Ale. This seems to be--in the estimation of many of my fellow BAs--the benchmark for American pale ales. While I still enjoy this beer's flavor and drinkability, I have to say this it wasn't nearly as good as I remembered it being. Now, this could be attributable to a bad bottle or my developing tastes, but I don't think this one has ever delivered the kind of bright and assertive hop flavors that I enjoy in this style. It's a very good beer, don't get me wrong.

Aroma: Mainly a piney smell along with some citrus lemon and grapefruit. Some bready malts also come through.  Taste: Pine hop taste along with some bread, biscuit and caramel malt. There’s also a hint of orange and some bitter finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.

However, I recently picked up a 12-pack in the can variety and I must say that I am somewhat disappointed. The given scores are for the bottle variety; however, taste needs to include an asterisk for the canned variety. Everything looked good going in but it all fell apart at the taste; there is some off bitter taste - almost tinny. The taste shift drops the score by 1 point which makes it still a very good beer over-all.

140,276,ThomasMetal75,3.88,"*Review sample was from 6/5/15*  A-Very sediment rich and unfiltered. Dark golden and copper in color. Has a nice 2 to 3 finger head that died somewhat, but never fully went away. Head itself was a tad rocky. Very carbonated. Looks great!  S- Very citusy and piney in the hops. Has a leathery note and a bit of dank, hop, resin. It's balanced by a nice, malty backbone. Sweet, caramel malts are present. Touch of breadiness as well.  T- Same as the taste. The hoppy notes are really the first thing that hits you in this beer. But for 38 IBUs, I think this beer is pretty hoppy without going overboard at all. It's certainly not an IPA, but it closely resembles one. Again, hops are citrusy and piney with a touch of leather. It's got a slight resinous/hop oily taste. Immediately after the hop profile, you notice this beer also has a very well balanced malty note. The malts are caramel and toffee in nature. Bready/biscuty as well. The beer leans slightly more on the hoppy than malty side, but I think the flavor profile is very well balanced in general. Great stuff!  F- This is a straight up medium bodied beer. It still retains the light oily, hoppy slickness that keeps the beer's profile very enjoyable. The finish is malty and sweet before it dries somewhat. The beer is crisp, clean, and very refreshing.  -Overall, this beer is a home-run. It's no secret why it has been around since the early 80's. It's not an overly complex beer, but it's not so light that it's dull. Hop heads should use this as a true ""session IPA"" (even if it's at 5.6% ABV). It would go fantastically with some buffalo wings, fish, or virtually anything on the grill. And it's not an expensive beer at all.

Respectable and satisfying hop presence. The nice yeasty twang on the back end adds to the overall positive drinking experience. The keyword for..as well as the achievement of this beer..is balance.

Can't figure out how that ever happened, but recently I picked up a 12-pack for my father-in-law, so I know this beer is (pretty) fresh, so I'm finally sitting down to review it.  A: Poured into a pint glass - hey, a ubiquitous craft beer deserves a ubiquitous glass, amirite? The body is coppery amber in color with a 1-finger slightly-off-white foamy head on top, which is reinforced by plenty of fine bubbles. It's a nice look, and it leaves behind plenty of lacing.  S: Classic APA, with nice malt foundation of toasted bread, which is then followed up with a mild hoppiness of faint citrus.  T: I've been drinking this beer for at least 20 years now, and of course my initial impression way back when was over how hoppy it was. Now, with hundreds of IPAs under my belt, I'm surprised at how malty this beer is when compared to my recollection and my more-recent exposure to hopped-up American IPAs. It more or less follows the nose, with some sweet malt setting the table along with toasted bread. The hops follow, providing a modest lemony, citrusy flavor that balances the malt to leave a lingering lemony taste on the palate into the aftertaste.  M: Nice and creamy - more so than I remember.

140,276,thehyperduck,4.05,"355 mL bottle from a sixer picked up at the LCBO; bottled on Mar 25 2015. This one finally became available for sale in the Ontario market sometime last week - and you can bet that I didn't waste any time in tracking it down. And now, let's see what all the fuss is about. Served slightly chilled.  Pours a foggy golden-amber hue, with visible flecks of hop particulate slowly hovering throughout the liquid. Roughly two fingers of head are produced, though it does not stick around terribly long. After a few minutes have passed, a bubbly film and foamy collar have taken its place, accompanied by some scant filaments of lace. The nose is largely dominated by the Cascade hops - plenty of pithy grapefruit, with lesser notes of lemon zest and orange. A light hint of pine resin is also noticeable, with suggestions of caramelized sugar, bready malt and toasted biscuit. Nothing too fancy, but it gets the job done.  In fact, the very same could be said of the flavour profile, too - it's well-made and tasty, but not the sort of pale ale that grabs your attention in any way whatsoever. The malt backbone is unassuming but reliably sturdy; a mild, caramelized sugar sweetness comes through, in addition to some nice toasted bread/biscuit flavours. Cascade hops take the reigns for the latter half of the sip, offering up familiar notes of grapefruit pith and orange zest. Finishes with a touch of resiny bitterness that lingers briefly into the aftertaste. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation levels that give this pale ale a somewhat crisp mouthfeel. It goes down smoothly and effortlessly.  Final Grade: 4.05, a solid A-. I can't help but feel that my palate has become rather spoiled, given the explosion of hop-forward pale ales that have flooded the market over the last 10 years or so. Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale hails from a simpler time - and while it may not boast a particularly exotic flavour profile, or the ability to smash your head in with a sledgehammer constructed entirely of hops - you really can't deny this one's quality. It's just supremely drinkable and refreshing - a true staple, though at $15/sixer (in this market), the local guys probably don't have much to worry about yet.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,m_hall,4.23,"Pour from a 12 oz bottle into a nonic pint. Clear golden in hue, topped by a two-finger off-white head that falls slowly, leaving good lacing.  Aromas are biscuit and citrus fruits, with some pine and earthy hops.  On tasting the malts come up front, with the same biscuit promised by the nose, along with a mild sweetness and light fruity esters. Hop notes soon follow, grapefruit and spice. Finish is dry and slightly chalky (but not unpleasantly so) with just a hint of resinous aftertaste. A good choice if you want a hoppy ale if IPA's are a bit too much for you.  Body is medium, slightly chewy, with good carbonation for a bit of zest. Alcohol is just right for this to be a good anytime drinker.  One of the ""grand old men,"" of US craft brewing (along with Anchor Steam, Stone Pale Ale, Samuel Adams Boston Lager, and a handful of others) the original American Pale Ale continues to live up to its reputation. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is solid in every respect... newer drinkers might wonder what all the genuflection is about with this one, but one has to realize that way back in the early 80's, this beer helped start a revolution in American brewcraft, along with providing a great showcase for US-grown hops from the Pacific Northwest.

Very mild taste, not highly hopped at all in either the initial taste, mid, or aftertaste. This surprised me. It was only about 10 weeks past its bottled date,. so hop fading should certainly not been an issue. Substantial mouth feel, especially for a pale ale. But, the overall taste is just so unremarkable.

A: It pours a pretty clear copper orange color like honey whose shade depends on the ambient lighting. Nice foamy head that results from a good pour, but make it a vigorous pour so that you can get the thick, sticky, foam resting on top.  S: The smell is nice with a toasty cracker base and hints of piney hops, mango citrus, and crisp apple.  T: The taste starts with the malty toasty flavor and then a mild hop character that then becomes a rush of baked golden delicious apple and a toasty grain malt base. It leaves a coating on the tongue that begs for another sip. It is quite delicious when chilled down real good.  F: The mouthfeel is pretty standard. Smooth crisp with carbonation that is a mild level of effervescence. Fine lacing on the glass and the head lasts until the last sip.

The texture is oily with a foamy carbonation to help it go down smooth. The medium body is flavored much like the aroma - citrus, pineapple, mango, and pine.

140,276,Colt-Seavers,3.82,"A: Light amber almost translucent that produced 2 fingers of slightly off-white head that dissipated into a medium-thin layer that remained until finished. Spotty lacing; beautiful in natural light.  S: Pine, citrus-grapefruit, and slight lemon zest. HOPS GLORIOLA! Sweet malt and then a less forward yeast-funk that makes it's self known right at the end.  T: A mirror of smell with the hop forward character dominating with piney-citrus - grapefruit, lemon zest, sweet malt (thank God) and then a bit of that yeast-funky-left the laundry in the washer too long flavor. This last bit of funk would be offensive with out the dominance of hops and subsequent sweetness of the malt. Together, the flavors work well.  MF: HOPS forward astringent, moderate carbonation that co-insides, on the oily side of light.  When I let the funk out, it always includes George Clinton. As far as beer is concerned, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is right there with GC!

Taste is a real nice refreshing beer. It's like one step away from an ipa, but it's a little lighter and crispier with less malt sweetness. Immediately get a nice prickle of carbonation up front. I get mild citrus followed by that classic Sierra Nevada piney hop flavor. However, rather than a lingering bitterness, a nice biscuity malt flavor takes over to finish the sip.  Overall super refreshing beer. One of the best sessionable beers I have tried. However, it's obviously not as flavorful of a beer as an ipa and feels a bit watery on the palate. This is expected for the style. I would pair this with a nice juicy slice of watermelon on a hot summer day. It gets a 92.5/100.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Pantalones,4.06,"Third bottle of this from the six-pack I picked up in February; bottling date is December 29th, 2014.  Pours pretty light in color, but once in the glass it's more of a dark gold/light orange sort of color. Almost coppery, now that I think about it. Mostly clear, with just a hint of haziness, and lots of little bubbles rising up from the bottom. Head is just slightly off-white and starts out fairly big, slowly shrinking away into a still-fairly-thick cap on the surface of the beer after a few minutes, leaving many trails behind on the sides of the glass as it goes. And of course, there's the neat little short stubby bottle with the ""green with yellow banner"" label that I've been able to recognize on sight since LONG before I ever actually drank beer. A very nice-looking beer in every category.  The smell seems to have a lot going on. There's some breadiness, almost a yeasty uncooked bread dough sort of thing to be specific, and of course the hops (which are piney and citrusy, leaning more toward the citrus side than most of the hoppy beers I've had so far.) The hops don't blast you in the face from a foot away in this one, but I do sometimes get faint little whiffs of citrus even at a distance, which really made me want to go ahead and drink some while I was writing the ""looks"" section of this review! The one downside: sometimes there's a bit of a funky smell that's a little offputting; I'm not really sure what this is, as it's hard to really pinpoint it even when it's present. In one of the earlier bottles it came across as ""orange and BO,"" and in this one it's sort of reminding me of a blend of bread and dirty clothes that have been sitting in the ""wash me"" pile for a bit too long. I don't always get this from the smell, though--sometimes I pick up the funkiness, other times it's just a pleasant yeasty-bread-and-hops smell. I'm going to sort of give the smell score something between the score I want to give it when it smells funky (probably a 3 or slightly below) and the score I want to give it when it smells more ""breadiness+orange/pine hops""-ish (upper 3s range, pushing 4)... leaning toward the higher scores a bit since the smell isn't really impacting my enjoyment of the beer, and I don't *always* pick up the funky bits.  Taste is more consistently good than the smell. I've had this at nearly a year after the bottling date and it was still not bad (the hops had faded for sure, but even then I could tell there was some citrusy type flavor in there along with the malts), and it's even better when it's fresh of course. There's yeasty bread-like flavors, slightly sweet (more so when it's older), and there's faintly bitter hop flavors too, citrusy and piney. As with the smell, the citrus stands out more in this one than in most of the other hoppy beers I've had--it's more clearly ""citrus+pine"" here rather than ""PINE!... and maybe some citrusiness too."" Sometimes I'm even getting a little bit of an herbal/spicy sort of flavor mingled in, but orange and pine are definitely the ones that stand out here. A citrusy flavor and just a bit of the accompanying bitterness hang around afterward. What bitterness is present is very mild and definitely blended with the flavors rather than standing out as its own harsh thing off to the side. Overall, it's really nice, and seems like it's more complex than the other pale ales I've tried rather than having one overwhelming flavor and only hints of the others.  Feel is also pretty nice. Not too fizzy, not too flat/watery, easy to drink but at the same time feels substantial enough to let you know this is definitely a beer, not some kind of flavored water drink. A bit of an oily/sticky thing going on, but not so strongly that it stands out a lot if you don't think about it.  Overall... this is a really nice beer. There's basically nothing below-average here, or even anything *average* for that matter--with the exception of the sometimes-funky smell, I have nothing but good things to say about this one. Even the smell isn't that much of a downside, which is saying a lot considering just how sensitive I am to bad smells (as in ""if something smells really bad to me, I can't bring myself to eat it."") I can see how this was so many people's ""wow, beer can taste like THIS?"" beer way back in the day when craft beer was a much smaller chunk of the market than it is today. I'm glad I decided to pick up a fresher six-pack of this one after trying an old one in a restaurant once... although I don't mind the old version either, it is definitely better with only 2 or 3 months of age on it rather than 10 or 11!

Loved how the small sediment clouded the whole beer, final chug an amazing experience  Smell-> Really nice orangy, lemony, citrussy smell. Hops are just amazing, really an amazing floral smell. Not sure if i perceived pine, maybe someone else did.  Taste-> Truly amazing, hops are perfect. Not overpowering and not too low. I can easily have 3 or 4 of these.  Feel-> Defenitely a crispy one, really good to the palate. Smooth and creamy. You can actually have this one at different temperatures! Im not a big fan of warm Pale Ales but this one I can.

140,276,GFM,3.84,"12oz bottle poured into pint glass. Pours a clear golden amber color with one finger of thin lacing. Ample carbonation and streaky, clinging lacing. Mild pungent hop scent with a grainy, earthy undertone. Don't sense much of a citrus aroma. Medium bodied feel; carbonation gives it some bite. Some hop bitterness but also an earthy taste and an occasional sweet undertone. A very balanced beer. This is the true embodiment of an American Pale Ale. I would choose it over many average IPAs but not over the better ones. (8.5)",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,TheElectricOne,3.6,"Poured from a can into a tulip.  Looks pretty, with an amber-copper color with a thick, bubbly head and carbonation bubbles continuously rising from the bottom of the glass. Unfortunately, not much in the way of an aroma, mostly just yeastiness. Smells like a lager. The taste makes up for it though, with nice piney and citrusy flavors for a cheap, canned pale ale. It's always been one of the most accessible and cheap beers that actually tastes good. The feel is crisp and smooth. Overall, a nice solid beer for anytime drinking.

Very well balanced and with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Very tasty and smooth, and exactly what a hoppy Pale Ale should be!  I would picking this one up if you haven't already.

140,276,JohnnyI,3.98,"Pours in to an IPA tulip with a honey-golden hue and a hint of amber. The bottle-conditioned brew leaves large pieces of sediment gently drifting to the bottom, while the finer particles stay suspended. The otherwise translucent appearance of the beer really highlights the unfiltered nature of this one. Adorning the liquid is a massive, fluffy head that mounds over the top. In time it settles to a rocky layer of white foam, with impressive staying power. In its wake, mottled lacing clings to the glass. A sweet Hawaiian roll aroma beckons, with some tropical fruit in the nose. Faint caramel malt flavors dance with some pale malt varieties and a complimentary orange citrus hop bitterness. There's a little toasted grain and dryness in the finish. After a few sips, a pleasant bready yeast flavor lingers on the tongue. Nice juicy body with adequate carbonation. Perfectly balanced. Everything is apparent, but in moderation. This is an artful example of how the sum of a beer's parts can be much greater than the whole (or in this case, the whole cone hops!). This one is easy to quaff and entices you to take the next sip. They don't call it a stylistic standard because it's ordinary. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale sets the bar pretty high.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Appearance: Pours a beautiful, clear, deep, dark, amber color with a quarter of a finger of white-colored head that completely dissolved away into an extremely thin lacing of foam that only partly covered the top of the beer.  Aroma: Nice aromas of bready, toasted malt, imparting aromas of sourdough bread, English muffins and French baguettes, followed by some floral, piney hops. I also get notes of caramel, black pepper, honeysuckle and clover.  Taste: Delicious! Strong flavors of toasted malt up front, imparting bready flavors of sourdough bread and English muffins, followed by some caramel-like sweetness, a good amount of black pepper, and a touch of coriander. The beer finishes with some beautifully balanced, piney, slightly bitter hops. Delicious!  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and nicely carbonated. With an ABV of 5.5%, there is no alcohol on the palate.

A very mild bitter up front then a slight malt finish.  M: [3.50] Carbonation and mouth feel are right for the style.  O: [3.50] This is a beer you could transition someone from BMC to craft with. It has a mild taste but is slightly more complex with a little more bitter bite than a standard AAL. Most of the Sierra Nevada stuff I try I really love. This I only like.

140,276,PhilHeinricke,4.79,"The Wonderful Taste of Pale Ale in a Bottle  I'm new here. I don't know what I'm doing. All I know is what I like. I had been going to a local micro-brewery for about a year, and their beers had a very distinct taste, a wonderful taste, that I had never experienced anywhere else. I tried a variety of beers from that place, some were better than others, but I began to notice that beers described as IPA or pale ale had that wonderful awesome taste.  I had seen this in the supermarket for a while, but I was never particularly interested. I didn't know anyone who drank it. I had my favorites with which I was very content. But when I noticed that pale ales had that taste and smell that I had grown to love, I decided to try it.  The first thing you notice is the color as you're pouring it into your glass. It's a rich, beautiful golden brown with a tint of orange. Then the smell. It had that unmistakable pale ale smell, and I apologize that I'm not sophisticated enough to describe it better. I don't know hops from barley from wheat. But the taste. That's the taste. That's the taste I've been longing for. Men have died trying to get that taste. I'd be lying to you if I told you it was a good as the tap from the local micro-brewery, but it has that great pale ale taste, and it's in a bottle.  After I tasted this, I went back and got a case of this.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

A - Clear and amber gold, with about a finger's worth of head that had all but disappeared by the time I turned around from throwing away the cap. Leaves a thin, swirling foam, almost like soap bubbles. Laces decently as I drink it.  S - A light, pleasing smell of floral and piney hops, with just a hint of biscuity malt. Nothing really stands out in the aroma.  T - Starts with some spicy, piney hops, which then gives way to the floral that is in the smell. Finishes with the biscuit malt, and a clean bitterness. At 5.6%, it certainly isn't a ""big"" beer, but there is no taste of alcohol at all.  M - Very mild carbonation leads to the impression that this beer is watery, but combined with a dry, clean finish, it is very refreshing.  O - If I had to describe this beer in one word, it would be ""inoffensive."" Which makes it, I suppose, a good example of a Pale Ale, not as hop forward as an IPA, which is the point. I always say ""This is my least favorite Sierra Nevada beer,"" but despite that, this is not a bad beer.

About 1 finger of head that dissipates almost immediately and leaves a very small layer on top of the beer.  Smell is exclusively pine needles.  Very piney in taste. Like chewing a pine one. Little Maltiness on the back.  Very carbonated. Almost as much as a soft drink.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Smell - The beer has a nice hop smell and smells sweet at the same time.  Mouthfeel - Smooth and medium bodies. Nothing to really note other than it is refreshing  Taste - Nice flavor of fresh hops with a nice fruit after taste. As some one who is not always a fan of bitter beers I felt this had great flavor and was well balanced.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Can see a few particles floating around in the beer, but not too many. Extremely minimal head retention. Can see a lot of carbonation floating up at a quick pace.  Smell - 3.5/5 Lots of piney hops smell. Perhaps a little citrus smell as well.  Taste - 4.25/5 Tastes of pine hops, but different from all other pine flavors I have tried. It's not as intense, but rather a little more subtle, like in the background...but yet still in the foreground. I like the pine taste in this beer better becaue I find the pine taste is usually overpowering in most piney beers. But here the pine taste is nicely balanced. There is a little sweetness, maybe some citrus flavors  Mouthfeel - 3.5/5 In between creamy and crisp. A nice carbonation kick, but not too overpowering. Medium body.  Overall - 4.25/5 This was a pretty good beer. I like the piney taste in moderation, but most beers with pine tastes have an overpowering pine taste. This beer had just the right amount of pine taste.

A hoppy freshness in it, grassy and lime undertones. Floral hop aromas of orange, lime and grapefruits, followed by a decent, slightly underwhelming bitterness. Malt character is present but gently hiding behind the hops, adding a necessary body to the beer. Watery ending with only small hints of hops, which lingers long on the tongue. Carbonation adding a freshness to the beer, without being too present, well balanced.

A - Crystal clear pale orange color with great white head. Perfect lacing. One of the most aesthetically pleasing beers I've ever seen.  S - Very nice hop nose with citrus notes, light pine, and a light floral character. Some caramel and malt along with some yeast fruitiness after the hops.  T - Similar to the smell but with more of the cascade hops shinning through. The definite grapefruit quality that is always mentioned with this beer and type of hops really comes through. However, this is definitely a pale ale and not an IPA since there is great balance with the malt profile and the caramel flavors that mingle with the hops. I would say that the flavors are perfect for a middle of the road type of beer.  M - Lighter-medium mouth-feel. Has some bitterness but mostly clean on the finish. Low-medium carbonation.  Overall, the hallmark of an APA style of beer. The balance, flavor impact, and drinkability make this beer great for any time and any place. Not my favorite beer or favorite style because I usually prefer big Imperial beers with more flavor impact but if you're looking for a beer to just drink with some buddies this is never a bad decision.

It pours clear with an orangish tinge probably due to the caramel malts. Had a decent head that quickly dissipated.  The smell is predominantly earthy hops with a distinct Cascade flavor showing through. I wouldn't really describe this beer as cirtrusy, but it has maybe a touch of grapefruit showing through.  The flavor is very balanced with malts at first, then a grapefruity finish afterwards. It is quite good, and it seems like a very modern sort of beer. Amazing that this was brewed in 1980.  This has changed my outlook on this beer. I drank a 12 pack of cans of this and was not impressed. It's either the freshness or the bottles that make this beer really shine.

140,276,humuloner22,4,"I have had this beer a number of times. The first time I had it, I was not impressed. I drank it numerous times over the years and was still not impressed. In fact I held off buying Sierra Nevada products until earlier this year I was at a beer festival and tried a few others. I began being a fan and have since tried numerous offerings. This particular Pale Ale came out of the fall variety pack. You know, this beer still isn't spectacular, but it is better than I remember it being.  Smooth, hoppy, but not overly so, some pale ales have a tendency to be too malty, this one is well balanced. I think the key here is to get it as fresh as possible. Its a solid offering. Maybe its a good transition from all the bruiser summer IPA's I have consumed and the more malty fall/winter beers I tend to drink. I was bitching about them including this one in the fall mixed pack but I think it is a welcomed addition. Now, I hear the winter pack is also including it, although it would not be my ideal beer, as long as they are fresh I think I would be alright with it. Although I would still rather have something that is more of a transition beer from Fall to Winter.  Overall: This is one of the better Pale Ales out there and it is found virtually everywhere.

It's distributed wide and far and, unless you've wandered very far off the beaten path, it's usually one of the few worthy brews you'll find almost everywhere. It's a pretty amber and it's hoppy, that's apparent right away. The Cascade hops throw a strong shadow over the malted barley. A nice, mellow head adds a smoothness to the mouthfeel but the sharpness of the aroma, to me, throws the floral notes and malty finish out of balance. One is usually enough before my palate asks to move on. Unless of course there is nothing else at which point you'll see me order another and complain not!

The hops are not as assertive as so many of the pale ales you'll find on the shelves today, and that's okay. Great balance and drinkability.  M) Medium body with pretty lively carbonation. Smooth and crisp at the same time. What type of sorcery is this? Goes down easy. Refreshing...  O) Why review this brew? What else can be said? Hmm... Not a helluva a lot, but it is a classic. I always like to pretend to remember my first Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. The year was 1995. Teenage me was at a Grateful Dead show at Soldier Field in Chicago, IL. I can still hear the call of the gentle hippies, as they pushed coolers of it around on skateboards. "" Ice cold Sierra Nevada!"" I thought it was the nectar of the gods. I also later thought I was in an Ewok village. Not sure where I'm going with this anymore, but in any case this is a great beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,hoptheology,3.23,"My first offering from Sierra Nevada.  Serving style : 12 oz stubbie poured into coke glass  Appearance (4) : The foam is like 4 fingers, dood. The body is slowly pushing up and eating the off-white foam. Said body is mostly transparent and honey-blonde colored. Lacing remains all the way down.  Smell (3.5) : Grass, rolling fields, plenty of hops. Reminds me of growing up near the Black Hills with the tall grass in the ditches and the smell of summer growth. Very grassy, very green. In fact that's about it. Grass and hops. Simple, but elegant.  Taste (3.25) : Lemony, bitter. A bit like chewing cud, some slight sorghum. Easy drinking. I'm just not a huge fan of bitter beers. This beer is a tad too bitter for the Pale Ale category. It's pushing the envelope for me but still passively enjoyable. Better than other pales I've tried. I can tell the hops are pretty fresh and man those female notes sing. Bittery and buttery.  Mouthfeel (3.5) : Very creamy and caramel-like. The carbonation is balanced so well. A smooth bitter pale ale.  Overall (3.23) : This is a refreshing beer, if a little too hoppy for its style. As I said I am not a fan of bitters and this pushes the envelope just a little too far for me, but it has a decent fresh, grassy flavor. I would not buy this again, ever...as it is too bitter for me. That's not to say it's a bad beer. I can review a beer on its good merits even if I don't agree with them. This is a good beer if you don't mind a little buttery bitterness in your brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,PaulietheBrit,4.5,"My dear wife picked this up for me on a whim, noticing, as she was, that I was drinking some good pale ales of late. It poured a beautiful clear amber with medium fizz building a great finger of white tight head, which subsequently fell quickly to leave its lacy story on my goblet wall. The aroma of pine and citrus notes first caressed my olfactory organ, then dominated with a malty caramel segue. Its flavors wash my tongue with hoppy grapefruit, leaving my taste buds awash with a dry bitter finish. I really enjoyed this APA and could keep drinking them, they don't over do any aspect, keeping a balance that keeps you wanting another mouthful.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,ovaltine,4.5,"Packaged 5/27/21, this gorgeous beer pours a nearly clear golden color with a couple of fingers of creamy oatmeal colored head that laces the glass beautifully. The nose has a bit of grapefruit and some nice resiny pine, and a substantial biscuity malt aroma. Fan-flocking-tastic.  The taste is really led by the grapefruit flavor, but it is the way that resiny pine and biscuity malt flavor glides this into a drying, smooth finish that has me hooked. This beer is perfectly balanced and it is superb , IMHO.  If I had the “you can only have one beer that’s widely available for the rest of your life” challenge put to me, it would be this beer or Two Hearted.

140,276,Redneckwine,4.12,"Appearance - Light orange/amber, clear, 2 finger head dissipates into a wispy cap, a bit of sticky lacing  Aroma - Floral/citrusy/grassy hops and sweet honey/bready malts in equal measure, I feel like the yeast and alcohol are imparting some fruity, spicy ester qualities.  Feel/Taste - Smooth medium body and bubbly, effervescent carb washes this one down like a champ. Like the nose, the taste is impeccably well balanced between a citrusy, piney, spicy hop bite and honeyed, toasty malts. Malt sweetness is just enough to balance. Mild-moderate lingering hop-resin bitterness on the end, and finishes quite dry.  Overall - Haven't had this in quite a while, it's so easy to brush over... Picked it up on a whim anyway to revisit and review. Glad I did,; reminded me that it really is an outstanding APA and certainly very worthy of it's classic status.

140,276,StoutHunter,4.11,"I picked up a bottle of Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale a few days ago in their new fall variety pack at Krogers. I've had this beer many times, especially when I first got into craft beer, but for some reason I've never reviewed it and it's time to revisit it, so lets see how it goes. No visible bottling date. Poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a imperial pint glass.  A- The label looks good, it's got that typical Sierra Nevada look and I would say it's somewhat classic looking, but it isn't the most eye catching. It poured a fairly clear golden color that took on more of a amber color when held to the light with over three fingers worth of fluffy white head that left some nice patchy and spotty rings of lacing behind and it died down to a thin ring that stayed till the end. This was a good looking beer, I have no complaints at all.  S- The aroma starts off with a slightly higher amount of medium sweetness with the hops being the first to show up and they impart a nice mixture of citrus rind aromas, mainly orange peels with some grassy and slightly floral hops showing up in the background. Up next comes a doughy yeast aroma followed by the malts which impart a caramel, bready slightly grainy and sweet malt like aroma. This beer has a good aroma, it was nicely balanced and very true to style.  T- The taste seems to be very similar to the aroma and it starts off with a medium amount of sweetness with the hops still being the first to show up and they impart the same aspects that they did in the aroma, but this time all the hoppy aspects seem to show up evenly. Up next comes a light doughy yeast flavor and it's followed by the malts which impart the same malty aspect that they did in the aroma with no single aspect sticking out the most and the sweet malts seemed to be toned down to just the right amount. On the finish there's a very light amount of medium bitterness that is right on the border of being lightly bitter and it had a nice citrus rind and grassy hop like aftertaste. This was a good tasting beer, the taste was just as balanced and as true to the style as the aroma was.  M- Smooth, crisp, clean finish, on the thicker side of being light bodied with a medium amount of carbonation. This beer had a good mouthfeel that worked well with it.  Overall I thought this was a good beer and great example of a classic American Pale, even though this beer seems a little mild compare to most American Pale Ales that are on the market now it is still exactly how the style was intended to be and it had that great balance that a lot of Pale Ales seem to overlook. This beer has great drinkability, it's very smooth, crisp, clean, not filling at all and the taste does a nice job at holding my attention, I could drink more than a few of these especially on a warm summer day and I like to think of this beer as the original craft session beer. What I like the most about this beer was the balance and they drinkability, to me those were the highlights of this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything that I would change or that I dislike, it's really nice just the way it is. I would buy this beer again, it's usually a good option when at a bar that doesn't have a good selection, it an old reliable. I would recommend this to anyone who is getting in to craft beer or American Pale Ales, it's a must try for any craft beer lover. All in all I was happy with this beer, it's always the same and it always delivered when I want a nice and easy drinking beer. It's one of my favorite American Pale Ales in the sense that it's exactly what the style is all about and I think it's one of the better beers from Sierra Nevada, especially for their year round beers. Good job guys, I've been enjoying this beer for a while and I hope to continue to for many years to come, keep up the hard work.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,LagerCognoscenti,4,Nice amber appearance with big head and excellent lacing. A little cloudy and had big chunks floating in it. Other bottles I've had of this also had chunks. I don't mind this.  This smells nice and hoppy with a marmalade or orange theme on the nose. The cascade hop really shines through and there's a complex but subtle mix of pine and citrus aromas.  The taste is very well balanced between malt and hops. The bitterness is quite noticeable and very pleasant with it's citric hop character. This beer reminded me in a strange way of Pilsner Urquell in that it has some significant hop bitterness but remains very easy to drink and tastes sessionable. Being an ale the flavour is way stronger than Urquell and much more fruity so the comparison must end there  I kicked off an evening with this at home before going out and it made a very tasty first beer and made me decide to put this widely available U.S. beer in my regular rotation  85/100,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,seedyone,3.62,"On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. It's easy to see how this is a go-to brew for so many. Subtle aroma, flavor that's not too much of anything, yet not too much nothing. Congenial & balanced are the hallmarks of this of this ubiquitous brew.  I for one will always be grateful to Sierra  12/19/12 On tap atRattle n Hum, NYC. Once the benchmark in hoppiness, this classic is sure to disappoint today's hop-heads. It harkens what I consider a more civilized time when one could drink a pint without having their taste buds mugged.  I'm having this vision of bar full of guys looking like the cast of ""This Old House"" in the first shot, toobelts & all, then the slide changes to them all dressed in sport jackets & chinos. A rugged sensibility.  Bear in mind there was a time when the expression IPA designated a brew modified for long distance travel. My best reference would be having General Tso's Chicken in the restaurant vs having it as a take-away. The crispiness created by the extra step of deep frying the cornstarch dredged pieces of chicken is deteriorated by the steaming that happens once it's placed in a closed container. There is enjoyment there, but it is altered. I doubt Gen. Tso is rolling is his grave, as the dish is American in origin, but you get the point.  Pale ale is/was the foundation of IPAs & India is a long way away from NYC, where I'm drinking this.  All things considered, this, as a stand alone brew, has a lot going for it. Block out all prejudice, kick back & enjoy a classic that helped lay the foundation for the craft world we enjoy today.  In 1896 the film ""The Kiss"" was considered outrageous & disgusting. It last 30 seconds on screen. It was, for better or worse, a sensation. Today's audience would not only be totally underwhelmed, but outright bored having to watch anything so mundane for a full 30 seconds.  My point is, try to appreciate what came before because nothing just happens out of the blue. Embrace the evolution.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

I took it as a good omen. (I think this beer has actually helped me with my fade.)",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,WhiteHillsStore,3.79,A great drinking beer. The appearance is a light orange with a nice white head. The smell is full of hops but does have some more earthy smells in it as well.

I can definitely see how this one is a popular beer today.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,enjambed,3.95,"Serving Type: Bottle Poured into glass. I thought I would try it at room temperature for something different. (Although it was very good as always, I would recommend it moderately chilled to 40-45 F)  Appearance: A moderate to hefty pour produces a one finger, soapy white head with lively carbonation and decent retention that settles down to a small cap. Good lacing as well, but I'm not that serious about these kinds of things. Color is a nice copper-orange hue standard for a pale ale.  Smell: Sweet malts, with some citrus hops, floral and a bit of pine. Overall, what you would expect in a cascade-based pale ale, but it's executed very well. Normally I can get more out of this beer, but my smell isn't as sensitive today.   Taste: My taste is not so sharp right now either, but I'll give it my best. Starts pretty plain, but finishes with clean, moderate bitterness and a very noticeable (and delicious) citrus/orange flavor. Possibly some pine there too, but it could just be the bitterness.  Addendum: had SNPA again today after a bit of a hiatus and found that there was a lot more grapefruit in both smell and taste than I originally put in this review.  Feel: Medium, not too interesting, but pale ales aren't known for mouthfeel. There is a decent amount of carbonation that makes it nice and lively, and adds a little bit of crispness that works well with the hops. Dry, dry finish.  Overall: Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is a well established benchmark for the American Pale Ale, and for good reasons. Everything is well-balanced, and you can kick back a few of them without hop overload. Someone with an IPA-warped palate will barely be able to notice the bitterness, but that makes it more approachable for non-BA's just starting out in craft beer. It's a solid, everyday pale ale at an affordable price.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,leantom,4.11,"An old favorite. Here goes:  A: Pours a clear orange-amber with a nice head. The head is fluffy and leaves plenty of lacing.  S: OK, but somewhat muted. I do like what I can smell, however. Some amber malt and ordinary brewer's yeast gives way to mild cascade hops. Citrus and some grapefruit from the hops.  T: Very, very refreshing. Very sweet caramel and amber malts giving way to cascade and chinook hops. The hops taste of grapefruit and citrus, and you taste them at the back of the throat upon swallowing. However, the hop portion is quite mild and it's balanced against the lightly-kilned malt. Very good.  M: Mouthfeel is perfect. Light and well-carbonated, just like a regular APA.  O: A very good representation of the APA style. Will have again and again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Perfect balance of floral citrus hops, light caramel and very light grainy sweet malt. A wee bit of pilsner like aroma is present. Neither the hops nor malt take over the aroma.  T: Starts with a beautiful floral Citrusy, grapefruit and mild pine flavor followed by a lemony citrus in the mid palate. Bitterness is present but subdued and balanced to the sweet malt flavor. The light lemon character and hop flavor persists in a semi dry finish. Quite a complex hop flavor going on here.  M:Medium body with a velvety texture. moderate carbonation. Smooth.  O: This is one of the best overall pale ales I've ever had. Balance is the word here.

Non-resilient lacing leaves small clots behind.  S- Bready aroma with some faint hops and a twinge of alcohol.  T- Hop presence is more noticeable in the flavor as the grainy malt comes first and then the bitterness slides across the palate with just the right amount of slight citrus to complement the breadiness of the malt.

140,276,ZagZagg,4.14,"12oz can into tulip  A: Deep goldenrod hue, a bit hazy without being completely opaque. Pouring for effect yielded a nice two and a half finger head of a paper white color - moderate to light retention. Lacing is minimal, but present. Carbonation is visible and the body appears medium to light  S: Sweet pine mixed with apricot, peach, and traces of very light mango. Mild resinous aroma – oak and fresh pine needles – juicy characteristics along with some spicy renderings – Citrus peel and minced ginger. Tail end of the nose is sweet and tropical.  T: Dry and resinous initially, mixture of oak bark and pine, notes of dry earth and peat, fresh grass with piquant notes of lemon citrus in the background. Crisp and diverse on the palate – the middle mouth introduces some maltier elements that articulate the caramel backbone while also being a bit bready. The light fruits from the nose are even more suppressed on the palate, only contributing a transient zest. The finish moves from zesty back to wood-bready hybrid, very well balanced.  M: Medium body, with medium-light carbonation – solid mouth feel, copes with the palate nicely – easy drinking – Aftertaste is dry but sweet.

A classic.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,silverevo9,3.9,"First time i drank this brew I was put off a little by the spike in carbonation from the aftertaste. Had the opportunity to drink this on tap in San Luis Obispo. Had a much better experience with it there, much smoother. But, I have the bottle again and reviewing from that. This beer is really great due to the bottle conditioning. The carbonation spike is probably due to the conditioning of the brew, which I've come to like. It does offer a different flavor profile from it. The carbonation being one. The second, being a thicker flavor profile. Citrus and pine flavors persist. On the nose and mouth it feels like I'm getting the raw form of all the ingredients put into this brew. Although I do prefer the Torpedo IPA, i would have no problem purchasing this beer again, if on tap. But as long as the Torpedo exists, i will not purchase the bottle version again. Lacing is sticky and has a nice hue to the head. Flavors get more intense as it warms. 5.6% alcohol keeps you stable for the long haul.

Taste: the taste was slightly spicy hint in the mouth and as it you drink it back it has a nice malty flavor. Overall I found the taste quite enjoying  Mouthfeel: I found it quite subtle and easy to drink. It left no aftertaste in my mouth overall it was enjoyable.

Aroma is pleasant, simple: clean malt, light biscuit and malty aromas; hops are grassy, earthy. Combination is simple but very enticing.  Taste is where this beer comes through to define american pale ales: clean malt flavors, not sweet, light biscuit and subtle caramel malts, some bread like flavors; hops are grassy, earthy, simple and easy.  Mouthfeel is on the bitter side with some good lingering hop bite while the malt flavors, presence and life enhance as the beer warms.

Mouthfeel: Nice carbonation on the tongue, light mouthfeel not a thick beer.  Overall: My go to session beer. I like to have one of these with dinner. Great pale ale.

A: Bright, clear amber coloring with one fingers worth of off white (parchment tinted) head with substantial pitting. Fades to a thin cap, leaving light amounts of damp lacing along the way.  S: Sweet malt with a background of spiced pine and floral aromas. The nose is subtle, just barely enough to let you ponder what it is you are getting a whiff of. My lady companion said it reminded her of dandelions and sweet peaches.  T: Smooth and creamy, with a snap of malt, and a dry finish. The Cascade hops make their presence known with a slight kick of bitterness after the malt passes, but they don't drive the flavor profile. One of those beers that make you go ""ahh"" after a sip.

Awesome creamy medium body for a pale ale, great mouth feel. Seems slightly subdued after getting used to the abundant NW IPAs, but quickly won me over with a nicely balanced array of hop flavors and the creamy body augments the incredible balance of malt and hop in this ale.

Smell - Fruity and refreshing aromas of pine, citrus, banana and honey.  Taste - Overall a very bitter and hoppy beer. Sips reveal citrus and banana notes, with a dominant grapefruit flavour. Banana cake flavours become more prominent when swallowed. Finishes with a bitter, cut grass after-taste.  Mouthfeel - A beer that feels clean and as light as air. The light carbonation provides a slight numbing tingle. A refreshing beer that goes down easily.  Overall - A refreshing and fruity beer; an APA which ventures towards IPA territory being hop-rich. Full of flavour with a pleasant albeit slightly weak aroma, and plenty of complexity to enjoy.

140,276,davidsumner,4.29,"Preamble - Pale Ale or IPA ? Hmmmm.... doesn't really matter to me; at the end of the day, it's good no matter how you name it. I prefer this over Torpedo; as Torpedo is a tad too heavy for me. Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale is world class and a mainstay in my beer fridge.  Poor - Good frothy poor leaving a generous two finger head. Decent lacing. The color is a warm amber; carbonation is great and because it's bottle conditioned, there is of course sediment resulting in a slight haze.  Nose - Nice light pine/resin hops with a light sweet malt backbone. Pine,citrus,floral.  Taste - Hop forward; piney, resiny, faint of citrus, biscuit and tea. Just how I like it; I'm a hop head and I prefer heavier hops, lighter malt. All and all, very nice, light quaffable beer.  This is a great sessionable, all times of day beer.

Now that I've made the transition I can see what the rave is about. Appearance is good, dark bronze with an inch of white creamy head. The smell is kind of faint to me, but I do detect some fruitiness and pine hops. Taste is amazing at first with fruitiness up front and then the piney hops come in to counteract. There's a slight malt presence but the hops pretty much dominate the finish. Leaves a lingering bitterness that is at first enjoyable but becomes a little too much after a while.

Back in 2012, it was a strange experience having beer that good from a can; when poured into cup, I could tell no difference.  Pours amber-gold with clarity, and 1/2 to 2-finger off-white head, with decent retention, and leaving beautiful sketchy lace. Mild but continuing spicy, piney, malty, floral and stone fruit aromas. Begins with mild carbonation, then sweet mild malt, which carries into spicy, piney hop bite, and then some mild stone fruits, before a drying, crisp but still chewy, malty finish.  Traditionally, has bite without being bitter, and is refreshing from the first sip, with a long flavorful finish. However, I believe there is a difference between SNPA brewed in N.C. and that brewed in Chico. The North Carolina version seems harsher, with less malt balance. The rating is for the Cal. version.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Grugalug,4.1,"Poured into a pint glass.  A- Pours a golden/amber color and is very clear. About 1.5 finger head with very nice lacing and good head retention. Looks like a textbook pale ale, and that's not a bad thing.  S- Dominant aromas are a pleasant piney smell along with citrus, primarily grapefruit. Smells very bright and crisp.  T- Very much reinforces the nose: pine and citrus, although this time the grapefruit overtakes the pine. Hop bitterness balances out the somewhat present sweetness, and it is mostly felt toward the back of the tongue and is mostly felt in the aftertaste. Refreshing and crisp just like the nose.  M- Mouthfeel is relatively light, although definitely not watery. Pleasant amount of carbonation makes it seem lively. Very easy to drink.  O- Just a great American Pale Ale. If you are unfamiliar with the style, you would have a hard time finding a better example to get introduced to it. Just a great beer with a lot to like.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,Boca-X,4.13,"Poured from a 24oz bottle into a shaker. Wonderful white, foamy heady, decent lacing throughout review.. A foggy, golden, honey hue.  Hops, citrus and pine on the nose. Lightly floral.  Smooth on the tongue, perfect carbonation. Slightly sweet up front with hints of honey and citrus. Finishes off with a lightly dry, bitter, hoppy mix of grapefruit and pine. The dry/bitterness doesn't last long and then the honey seems to comes full circle, leaving a very pleasant sweet note behind.  This is a very smooth and refreshing brew. Not complex, just very complete. Nicely balanced and easy to drink. The hoppy finish is quick, cleansing your taste buds and in return beckons for another swallow...and then another...and another. Great everyday pale ale...Salud!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,TheMirrorOwl,3.63,"Appearance: Honey golden amber, voluminous white head, lots of lacing. Tons of carbonation visible, dissipates quickly.  Smell: Floral, citrus fruit and sweet malt.  Taste: Moderately bitter grapefruit flavor leads into sweet floral earthy malt. Pine in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Lighter on the medium-bodied scale. The carbonation dissipates quickly, which I like, but that leaves the beer somewhat sticky feeling. Fairly astringent.  Overall: The hop potency is more akin to an American IPA, which is what I'd call this by traditional standards. No denying this is a great brew. There are finer, but for the money, this is a well crafted IPA that doesn't disappoint. A solid go-to for hop heads everywhere.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

The head lasted a very long time, and left a nice coating on the inside of the glass.  Smell: Pleasant, with a nice hops bitterness in the aroma. There is some sweet aromas, but the hops definitely dominate.  Taste: A nice mix of hops and malt flavors, that make for an interesting and complex Pale Ale. There is a nice after-taste, and the hops flavor lasts for a while but not too long.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and crisp, with a medium body.

A very rich aroma of spicy malts and and orange citrus gave me a good punch. Very tasty; citrus mixed with a caramel, bready flavoring and a malty aftertaste. Crisp carbonation with a subtle creaminess; really helps to make the drink refreshing and makes you want to go back for more.

140,276,taxandbeerguy,4.13,"Got this in a trade from a friend of mine. Served chille dinto a pint glass.  Appearance- Hazy, orangy copper color, with 1.5 fingers of white head receding down to a half finger or so which is maintained for a good while. Decent level of carbonation seems to be present in the beer. Probably one of the orangest beers I've tried. Some nice lines of lacing left around the glass.  Smell - Nice blend between some sweet maltiness and good hop bite as well.Sort of reminiscent of tropical fruits namely some mango aroma blended in with the burn sugar or molasses malt and the citrusy hops.  Taste - Like the nose but subtle and a little milder than I expected, the malts work well with the tropical fruit nature of this beer. There's a trace element of leather hiding in the background towards the end of the sip which is interesting and works well here. Full flavored for the style, but was hoping for a bit more hop presence.  Mouthfeel - Smooth and velvety, with little distinguishable carbonation. A little soft in the mouth but does have great quaffability that could easily make this a great daily drinker If I had more access to it.  Overall - A great beer, that lived up to the hype I had built up in mind. Deliciously drinkable and just a great pale ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Emnmarko,3.94,"A- Has the color of golden honey. This is quite a clear brew. Active carbonation delivers a heaping 2+ finger head but it dissipates quickly leaving a nice halo with abundant lacing.  S- Light roasted malts along with a sweet citrus aroma.  T- Up first is a pleasant malt base with spice. Following this is a mild hop bitterness that transitions smoothly. Finally a light peppery aftertaste comes through and finishes this ale off nicely.  M- Medium bodied with a slight tickle from the carbonation. Leaves a mild buttery feeling. Dry finish.  O- This is a fine example of a pale ale. Personally I prefer a brew with an emphasis on the hop bitterness, but this beer is balanced nicely. Very easy to drink, and I will be enjoying this addition to Sierra Nevada again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Tall fluffy white head collapses and leaves a good amount of lace throughout.  Smell: Grains, bread, and citrus up front. Notes of spice break out in the hops.  Taste: The hops hit first; orange and grapefruit. The malts break things up very well. Bread and grains dominate the malts. This beer really finds its 'zen' when it hits optimum balance. The hops are tamed but not overridden by the malts. The hops return in the finish, straight citrus in flavor. Overall it is very smooth, goes down well, and has a semi-dry finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied. Moderate carbonation, somewhat flat for my liking.

Smells crisp and the smell is unique due to the use of whole cone hops. Taste Strong hop presence considering its only 30 IBU, it’s not too heavy, refreshing and yet “down to business” enough to remind you that you are drinking THE IPA. It’s available everywhere now days and it is what started the love for so many IPA drinkers and once you have one you’ll understand why. Overall This is one to be recommended to everyone.

Despite a purchase made out of complete desperation, this turned out to be a great American pale ale due to it's absolute simplicity. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is like a good burger. It would not be prudent to add too many other toppings and over complicate things. The aroma is amazing, the taste of hops is perfectly balanced, and this beer goes down really smooth. The price is fair, and this one is about as easy to get as my women. There are only 175 calories in a 12oz. bottle, and since its loaded with hops, it's also loaded with healthy polythenols, that will hopefully balance out the damage my liver takes whenever I buy this beer and end up drinking too much!

Poured into tulip; clear golden orange with a nice fluffy white head that leaves rocky, sticky lacing as it descends lazily. Smells mostly of metallic malt, with a lingering hint of spicy hops. Not really any citrus to be found, sadly, in a bottle this old. Taste isn't bad, although it's very obvious the hop flavors have faded greatly. Begins with a spike of herbal and spicy bitterness and some grassy flavors with the ghost of citrus that once was, then moves into very light, clean malt. Finishes wet, clean and a little bitter. Mouthfeel is light and effervescent, very pleasing. Overall, I picked this up because I had always skipped it over for something else, and I figured I should try SN's flagship, but I regret doing so with such an old 6-pack. I am loathe to associate myself with those who whip themselves into a righteous rage over the thought of a store that lets IPAs sit on shelves longer than a week, but it's nothing so ridiculous to acknowledge that 4 months is too old for this beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

I am a huge supporter of craft beer especially Sierra Nevada, but today I noticed something... Earlier today I enjoyed a pale ale in the can and it tasted great just as I would expect. Hoppy, balanced, a typical SN pale ale. Later in the day I had a pale ale in the bottle (bottling code 319311014) which was totally different. It was malt forward and sweet. The hop character was subdued. It almost tasted like fat tire or Sam Adams. What's going on Sierra Nevada? I have heard that Sierra Nevada was adjusting some of its recipes...

The malt is sweet like honey and contrasts the bitterness of the American hops perfectly. I don't see this as a world class beer to be sipped out of snifters or a beer to impress anyone.

140,276,Das_Reh,2.25,"Poured from a bottle into a glass.  This is supposedly THE original APA, and one of America's first craft brews. I was eager to try it after seeing the high reviews on BA.  Appearance - A nice, deep coppery color with a decent cream colored head. Lively carbonation, almost no lacing, which was disappointing. I noticed ""floaties"" in the beer as I poured, which settled to the bottom of the glass like bits of backwash... very unappetizing.  Smell - practically nonexistent... some citrusy hops and not much else.  Taste - Good grief... why are the ratings so high? It's a 1-note acrid bitterness with virtually no maltiness. The citrus/pine hop flavors are barely present, and a sticky, tart bitterness overwhelms the palette... I know Pale's and IPA's are MEANT to be hoppy and bitter, but there's no balance here. It's just NOT good.  Mouthfeel - Mouthfeel is medium, and frankly unmemorable.  Overall - A bitter, overhyped concoction of hops, hops and more hops. No balance, no complexity. This was my second one and I will not drink another. I'll stick to Two-Hearted.  NOTE: In retrospect I am under the impression that I may have been drinking bottles that were out of date.

Earthy floral hop aroma with some grassy, resinous pine and subtle citrus countered by bread/yeast and pale malt sweetness.  A touch of grapefruit and citrus peel followed by some caramel malt and toffee.    Surprisingly full bodied for the style with a blast of dank, sticky hops giving off strong dry bitterness that lingers over the yeast and sweet malt notes into a dry finish.  Hop flavor is a bit one dimensional with bitter earthy character.  Lots of grass, pine needle and spruce tip with very little of the citrus/tropical fruit notes found in the nose.  It's there providing subtle sweetness but is overpowered by bitterness and strong malt flavors.  Hop bitterness is countered by bready yeast and malt sweetness.

Slightly sweet with a hint of citrus. I also pick up a very subtle bready scent.  T - This is where this beer really shines. It is ever so slightly bitter, yet it yields a nice citrus flavor that covers the whole pallet. The bitterness really shines through just after you swallow the beer. It quickly fades and you find your mouth begging for another gulp. It really delivers in this category.  M - Medium bodied, perfect carbonation in my opinion.  O - I am pleasantly surprised by this beer. It is my first brew by Sierra Nevada and definitely not my last. At 5.6% ABV I could drink this beer all day.

Perhaps some toffee/caramel too?  Taste is immediately bright, floral and a little bitter, with hops delivering those lemon and orange notes. At the center is that classic, slightly herbal, caramel backbone.  Mouthfeel is prickly, but soft, if that makes sense. Ample carbonation. Coats the tongue for a good couple seconds and then leaves a dry finish. Lemony, herbal aftertaste, almost like tea.  Man, I can pound these back entirely too fast.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,abeeronthebeach,3.82,"A - A copper-gold liquid fills the glass. You expect this beer to have some flavour and it does. Lacing is generous and sticks around.  S - Grapefruit, a modicum of sweet malt. Hop bitterness.  T - Clean, very crisp due to the hop character. Opens with a little sweetness before the main citrus-hops arrives ending nice and dryly. Hoppiness is definitely at the citrus rather than the pine end of the spectrum. Surprisingly strong-flavoured and has that more-ishness which keeps you sipping  M - Satisfying, well-balanced. I thought the mouthfeel was pretty much spot on with this one.  O - I enjoyed this a lot more on tap than I remember enjoying it from the bottle. It's nice to have a widely available beer of such solid quality to fall back on. A fine beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,jawlessbody,4.09,"Poured from bottle into a nonic glass.  Appearance: Pours a clear, light amber with a fluffy 3 finger head that dissipates quickly. Lots of visible carbonation after the pour with small bubbles continuing throughout the length of the drink.  Scent: The nose is typical of a pale ale: hoppy and citrusy, but with a hint of pine.  Taste: This beer yields some very complex flavors. There's a sharp hoppiness right off the bat, followed up by citrus and pine with a slightly malty finish. There's also just a little warmth from the alcohol. Overall it's a balanced beer, with a slight emphasis on the hops. Very drinkable.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with a good amount of carbonation. Crisp finish.  Overall: This is an incredible beer for the price. It's drinkable enough to have a few, but it's not boring.

140,276,DeFaz,4.25,"I was looking at the recent reviews for this beer, and I was surprised that it isn't rated as the exceptional beer that I perceive it to be and as the beer that it used to be. Is it because the quality has gone down? I think not. I think right now--the age of the double IPA and the triple IPA--there is the desire for more and more--more hops and a higher ABV. This APA isn't about quantity, it's about quality, and the hops are nicely composed but they are also balanced. A pour of this beer reveals a great head with sticky lacing, and the beer has a smell and taste of hops that offer citrus, floral, and pine flavors. The mouthfeel is spot on for a hoppy session beer--perfect thickness and carbonation, giving it a nice crispness. Maybe this beer is too easy to find (much like how Sam Adams Boston Lager has become so taken for granted and too ""weak"" to be appreciated), but I think this is much better than many of the amped up double IPAs with their 10% ABV.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

I've tried all kinds of lagers, pilsners, mexican, ales, stouts, lights, etc. I tend to go in flavor-of-the-month phases for a few months or up to a couple years. Also, I don't travel, so my repertoire is limited to what's at the local supermarket in So Cal.  Anyhow, for a flavorful, 'strong' beer (ahem, ale), SN Pale Ale is a clear favorite. In addition to the flavor and quality, I think they have good quality control as I've yet to come across a bad batch at the local market. I don't know its availability outside CA, but if you see it and have not tried it, I highly recommend it.

This one came from a bottle and when I poured it up in my favorite glass:  A: Pored with a nice head of about 2 fingers. Head retention was great and was an off white color. Lacing lasted a long time on the sides of the glass. Color was a deep amber color and it was clear, with no chill haze or sediment.  S: The smell had a very pronounced hops aroma which I find appealing. It was not overpowering but just begged for me to taste and see if the hops flavor would be pronounced also.  T: My first drink proved that the hop aroma was just a hint of what was to come, as the hops stood out. The carbonation left a little bite on the tongue and the hops left a bitter taste on the back of the tongue. Not too much bitter, but enough to balance the beer. I might detect citrus in there also. I am a novice beer taster so sorry I cant be detailed enough. Just know I liked the hoppy flavor.  M: I would call this a medium body beer as it did not feel watery, but did not feel thick either.

I haven't checked the price of this beer yet, but I hope I can afford it! The head stayed moderate throughout the enjoyment of this beer. It smelled a little piney and woodsy and I didn't want to drink the last damn drop knowing that this is the only bottle I had of it. What a teaser!

Slightly bitter, lots of citrus from the hops and a nice bready malt that lingers around at the end. Great balance.  M: SN always nails this one. Good carbonation.

This a great pale ale, hoppy, slight bitter, but I don't like the lingering bitterness. I have toured Sierra Nevada's Chico plant, and they put every other brewery I have been to to shame when it comes to facilities, and tours. Part of that is the lack of corporate bureaucracy, since it is still a private brewery, and hopefully will remain so forever. If anyone goes through Chico,CA I would highly recommend this tour.

140,276,JohnnyJam,3.87,"Well I've been drinking this one for a while but haven't reviewed it yet. The beer from a bottle is better. Perhaps it doesn't make sense; I've taken some time and I have come to the conclusion that the can is not as good. It is a staple in my beer refrigerator. Always a great price.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle with a date code (my beer is four moths old) into a pint glass and I get one finger of head.  A: Pours a golden amber color with one finger of head that dissipates quickly to almost nothing but a ring around the glass on top. Little to no lacing.  S: Biscuit smell upfront that is sweet and malty and is followed by floral citrusy smell. There is really nothing that smells like pine or a resin pine smell. Very pleasing and balanced between the malt and the hop.  T: Caramel malt and hop bitterness that are not complex but completely balanced. It finishes slightly bitter.  M: This beer goes down good. It is slightly lighter than medium bodied with medium carbonation. It leaves my mouth slightly dry.  O: This is an outstanding beer. It's always available and I always have it in my refrigerator. It is very drinkable: smooth, balanced, and refreshing.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

One finger of head with nice retention and lacing.  S: A good balance of sweet malt and citrusy hops.  T: A very balanced and evenly matched combination of sweet malts and bitter hops. Bitterness is good and not too overwhelming for a Pale. Some light citrus is made present and perhaps a touch of very slight piney flavor. Sweet slightly toasty malts make up the other half of the beer and make the beer more balanced.  O: A good drinkable beer. It would not be unsuitable to drink two or three of these at a BBQ or get together or any other social occasion but not really something I would be satisfied with during a massive hop craving.

I like this one for its smooth drinkability combined with that tangy pale ale taste - not to mention the fact that at many restaurants that have not yet embraced the craft beer revolution, this remains the best available choice on the menu, so I still drink it fairly often.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,archyquaffer,3.91,"Poured from the oversize bomber into a shaker. A moderate pour produces about 1.5 inches of creamy, off-white head that's plenty sticky. The beer is hazy, with a deep straw color.  Sweet malt and mild floral hops are apparent on the nose and palate. I detect undertones of a sweetness suggestive of honey sweetened tea. The hops assert themselves, but do not overpower, and blend with the fruitiness of the malt to produce a mild and sweet citrus taste similar to a tangerine. A mild bitterness lingers on the tongue, with fruity aftertastes wafting from the burps...  This is one of my ""go to"" beers- it's refreshing and epitomizes a west coast pale ale without going overboard on the hops. The 24 ounce bombers can often be had in my town for around $2.99 on special (cheap!), and the larger size bottles are also great for filling with homebrew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,BethanyB,3.86,"Appearance: The beady, off-white head has a creamy top and real staying power. The color is a medium amber, and clarity is slightly hazy, presumably due to dry hopping.  Smell: Floral citrusy hops are nicely balanced with grainy malt. A touch of honey is detected as the beer warms.  Taste: Toasted biscuit malt with a touch of caramel. Bitterness is medium-high and lasts through the finish, but still allows the malt to come through. Citrus hop flavor plays a soft, yet noteworthy secondary role.  Mouthfeel: Medium mouthfeel and medium-high carbonation. Good balance of smoothness on the palette and dryness in the finish.  Overall: A solid example of an APA. Sessionable and balanced, but at the same time, diversified enough to keep things interesting.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Overall a solid looking pale ale.  The aroma includes a faint floral to fruity hop quality with a caramel to toffee and biscuit-like grain presence that has a soft touch of butter towards the back end. Not the most vibrant bouquet but enjoyable and easily approachable.  The flavor is clean and crisp with a hoppy bitterness that is somewhat herbal and floral to fruity. Just like the aroma suggested, plenty of caramel malt that blends into the finish and is a bit buttery.  This is a light bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Overall this is solid and very easy drinking. It is a well made brew that sometimes I have admittedly overlooked in lieu of less familiar faces and/or seasonal offerings that are not always available.

T - Caramel malts, grain, pine, light spice, fair bitterness with a melodic finish. Many pale ales have a strong affection with one attribute; this guy has balance.  M - Light-medium body with moderate carbonation.  O - Highly drinkable, remarkably accessible and affordable.

Quite some carbonation for an ale. Leaves a good amount of lacing. Looking good.  Smell: Grapefruit, citrus at start, goes to floral, spicy, light tropical. Some white grape notes and light earthy, wax crayons. Covered with malty sweetness. Good balance, like a good summer fruity ice tea.  Taste: Floral goes to light sweet malt, biscuit middle. Then the medium pine, grapefruit, citrus hop bitterness comes and lightly stays with you for a while. Also some light earthy and spicy notes.  Mouthfeel: Medium, silky body.

Evidently highly carbonated.  s: Hint of pine.  t: Nicely balanced as a pale ale should be. Easy drinking. Apparently mine was not as hopped-up as other reviews have suggested this ale usually is, possibly due to its being about four months old.  m: Silky smooth almost to a fault, in fact curiously slick, almost like you were drinking hoppy light lubricating oil.  o: A different Pale Ale due to the unusually smooth mouthfeel.

Aroma of tropical fruit along with a little floral hop character. Some toast and biscuit from the malt provides a nice backdrop.  An amazing hop/malt balance on the flavor. Floral and fruit up front quickly followed by light toast and a touch of biscuity. A moderate bitterness helps dry out the mouthfeel leading to a crisp finish.

Taste: Piney bitter hops with with some grapefruit upfront, this is somewhat compensated for by an undertone of bisctuity maltiness. Very pleasing to my palate.  Mouthfeel: Highly carbonated, somewhat dry, still refreshing. It has enough body to be very satisfying while still being highly drinkable for those with a taste for hops.  Overall: This is one of the best and most common examples of an American Pale Ale, and while it is certainly not the end-all-be-all APA, it is an immensely satisfying beer in every respect.

The aroma is grainy and bready with a dash of earthy hops that smell clean and crisp.  The body falls into the medium range and the texture is generally smooth.  As far as the taste there is a quick biscuit and grainy maltiness but then the hops explode but simmer down to a moderate dry finish.

With searching I get bubblegum, lemon, and a woody grassiness (like EKGoldings hops).  Tastes much like the flavor. Nice cohumulone grassy edginess gives girth to the flavor profile. This is very hoppy for a pale ale. Apricot and pear esters, mild biscuity malt base. Flavorful, but not a complex monster that would turn this easy drinker into something disjointed or ponderous. Hop flavors are really well integrated. Oranges, mild baby aspirin, grapefruit pithy. Ptihy is drying in the finish and helps clean the tongue in the aftertaste. Heavy carbonation stings in the aftertaste, but is somehow fine-bubbled and creamy when liquid is in the mouth. Md-light viscosity is somehow a bit creamy, too.

140,276,ThePaintedGrey,3.51,"12oz. bottle poured into standard bar glass. Reviewed from notes.  A: A rich amber color, with some haziness throughout from the yeast sediment. A lustrous cream-colored head eventually deflates to a very respectable frothy cap that retains quite nicely. Sticky lace is found all over the glass. I was quite surprised, to be honest, in this department.  S: Lots of hop and citrus aroma, with bits of pine and yeast. Not detecting much of a malt sweetness here at all. A little underwhelming throughout.  T: A sharp hop bitterness up front, with the typical hoppy/citric flavor overall, with some flowery, grassy, and pine undertones. A very weak malty backbone struggles to contain the bitterness, but does manage to round it all off in the finish. I did notice a refreshing bit of spice in the finish, with a very slight hint of alcohol warmth as it goes down.  M: Medium-bodied throughout with a nice creamy texture and mild carbonation. Very solid in the mouth and drinks really well.  O: I don't hold this in high regard as some seem to, but this is a solid brew in its own right.

140,276,BeerDocT,3.93,"Appearance 3.75: Poured out an opaque orangey golden color. Slight head quickly dissipated leaving the typical swirly foam on top. Striking look to this beer.  Smell 3.75: Very nice bouquet. Sharp, alkaline hop scent with a light hit of concentrated citrus. This is a refreshing hop hit, hard to describe. Almost like quinine.  Taste 4.0: Very nice. Front is smooth and slightly sweet. Middle is slightly dry, with deep barley and malt tastes and is velvety smooth. There is also the first hint of hops here. Finish is where the hops really come in, but it is a balanced wave of alkaline hops and features the good hop tastes of citrus and a slight chlorophyll. Aftertaste features a pleasing switch in the hop tastes: it turns to an emphasis on certain resiny, piney taste and a return of the malt, all of which is subdued and refreshing.  Mouthfeel 4.0: Creamy carbonation and general smooth as silky mouthfeel. Nice.  Overall 4.0: Outstanding and a great brew. Smooth and balanced with a little more hoppiness than some may like. I, however, am a hop-head and love it. This beer is slightly sweeter than you might expect from a bottle-conditioned beer, but it makes up for it in its sessionability. I could quaff this bad momma all night. And probably will... . ;) Recommended.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,andre_dufour,4.25,"Served from a 12 fl oz bottle into a pub glass.  Appearance: Murky and solid gold, with a mild but crisp carbonation. If you pour it with a half inch head, it'll stay with you to the bottom of the glass. The lacing is thick and obvious from start to finish.  Smell: The piney cascade hops will be the first thing to waft up from the glass, but you'll get a sense of the citrus in the background as well. You should also be able to get a brief whiff of the spicy undertones.  Taste: As with the smell, you'll notice pine first, citrus second, and a spicy undertone to compliment the finished flavor. As the beer warms, the spicy citrus aspect becomes much more prominent. The aggressiveness of the pine is tempered by attributes of dryness and graininess. The balance results in a strong and flavorful, yet tame and welcoming APA.  Mouthfeel: The carbonation is perfectly balanced. The body is heavy enough to startle the palate, but smooth enough not overwhelm it. Very dry throughout, and a very brisk finish.  Overall: Excellent and prominent flavor, while still remaining extremely drinkable.

Taste- Deep earthy hops with some pepper in the beginning, almost grassy with some baked-goods notes of grain. Pretty dry finish. Extremely full flavored pale ale that doesn't hide behind anything sweet like some other brews. Hints of citrus characteristic of pale ales sneaks in once warmed a little. Clean yeast.  Mouthfeel-Pretty dry, very dense carbonation left me pretty filled up. Medium thickness that thinned with the finish, very zippy.

No idea what it looked like, but I'll give it a ""4"" based on SN's other offerings.  This is a good, serviceable, tasty, enjoyable APA. Carbonation is just about perfect. Clean, sharp mouthfeel. I hesitate to use the term ""astringent"" because that makes it sound like a mouthwash (which it definitely isn't). Yes, it's got some hops bite, but the hops aren't overwhelming. At 5.8% ABV, it's manageable and even sessionable.  I really like this beer. It's not even close to my favorite APA - Hill Farmstead's Edward - but it's one that I'd certainly give a prominent spot in the beer fridge.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,TrueHT,4,"Comming from California, Ive always kept a bunch of these tasties in my fridge for as along as I can remember, but I will try to review this as neutral as I can.  Despite its level of hoppiness, this beer is very balanced and drinkable. It is not only balanced, but extremely crisp and clean. The initial flavor comes off citrussy and pure and has an after taste of pine and hops that isn't overly bitter.  What a lot of people fail to mention is its affordability. I see this beer all over the USA in just about every store. I rarely see it sell for more than 8 dollars a 6-pack. To get a beer of this quality for that price just makes it an obvious go-to beer even for a college student with a tight budget.  The company is known for brewing a lot of different recipes and sharing all if it on the market. All their stuff is pretty decent, but this original has always been my favorite.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,brureview,4.28,"9/18/16 Changed my mind about this beer. Poured in a Stone IPA glass. Malty, syrupy, very earthy, sweet. Lightly bitter. Great beer! excellent MF for a APA.  The beer pours a light honey color into a pint glass with a 2 finger head.  The aroma is light pine.  The mouth feel is lightly carbonated and well suited to the style. Often Pale Ales are too carbonated and not well-balanced.  The taste is bready and piney, finishing with a hoppy fruity finish and a light bitterness.  The beer is a balanced, full flavored Pale Ale, and is unlike other beers in the style, which are either too carbonated, hoppy and/or lack a pronounced taste.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

I've of course had this plenty of times before, but we finished the rest of the 12-pack today, 6/8/2013.  Aroma: Nice and citrus + earthy hoppiness, not a whole lot else going on besides a little bit of malt sweetness. Thick nose but lighter on the actual aroma. (3.75)  Colour: Poured this out into a glass to assess- pours a light amber body with a nice fluffy 2cm white head that dissipates fairly quickly into a medium-thick film on top of the beer. Lacing isn't too bad. (3.75)  Flavour: It's great- very hoppy and citrusy with some earthiness in there. There's a good presence of malt sweetness in terms of honey although its predominantly hoppy. Very tasty and easy to drink- not a complicated pale ale by any means. I give it points for pretty much inventing the APA style. (4)  Mouthfeel: So easy to drink and refreshing. Beats any of the canned AALs out there- I'll drink it anytime. Crisp, thinner bodied with great carbonation out of the can that finishes refreshingly wet. Aftertaste is hoppy earthiness.

140,276,Slackerville,3.92,"Truly a legend in the pale ale realm. Brewed with strong hop character on the nose and palate with a balanced malt base well before the US IPA revolution. After a few decades still a great example of the style.  Probably everyone has had at least one of these so no need for a detailed review. Too sum it up, if I was stranded on a desert island and could drink as much beer as I wanted but only have one beer this would be it.

140,276,Beric,4.21,"Serving: Bottle poured into pint glass Served: 28 Aug 2013 Brewed: 23 July 2013  Appearance: A copper-reddish color with a nice one finger head that collapses to just a ring of foam around the edge. Little carbonation coming up from the bottom of the glass. Frothy semi-dirty looking head.  Smell: Great balance of malt and hop here. The aroma hops won't whack you over the face, but they are present in the nose. Sweeter smelling malts play great with the smell of the hops.  Taste: A more intense version of the nose. Great interplay between malts and slightly bitter hops. A nice assertive bitter-citrus hop quality is balanced with malt that allows the palate to remain fresh and conditioned for another sip. The hops are not too strong, but can certainly be tasted slightly. A masterfully balanced taste.  Mouthfeel: Great carbonation allows this one to feel thicker on the tongue than the beer actually is, allowing it to be enjoyable for some time in the glass.  Overall: This is my standard for comparison for APAs. Sierra Nevada has a fantastic, delicious beer here that is easy to compare to others in the style in all categories, especially color and hoppiness. This is a go-to beer for me due to it's balanced flavors, yet noticeable complexity.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Upon being poured, Sierra Nevada’s Pale Ale develops a wonderfully long-lasting, two-finger head of dense, white foam. The liquid is transparent gold.  The smell is pretty subdued, but I get a sweet biscuit scent and maybe a slight hint of citrus.  This beer’s taste is remarkably well-balanced and packs a lot of flavor for its style. More than anything else, I taste sweet, bready yeastiness, but it also has some pine and citrus, and a subtle, hoppy bitterness.  The mouthfeel is crisp and smooth, yet substantial.

I'd say it lacks interest for me though. The flavors I look forward to in a beer are not there. It's pretty one-dimensional and it's just okay in my opinion.

140,276,dougbassett,4.22,"One of the ""1001 Beers You Must Taste Before You Die"" -- #24 of the ones I've reviewed here.  This is another American craft beer classic -- while it never really got as big/mainstream as Sam Adams, it did start up around the same time and is widely available in the US (particularly in Cities).  This is probably my favorite large American brewery, and their flagship beer, the pale ale, is excellent. The color is amazing, pretty close to the Platonic ideal of a pale ale: with a nice head that's lingers satisfyingly. A nose of flowery, spicy hops, quite pleasant. That's more or less matched in the flavors, although I'd appreciate the hops a bit more forward here, it's a bit too restrained for my taste. I do like the bitter hop finish, which is lasting, and I also like the mouthfeel -- this is an example to me of a beer that's brewed with just the right amount of body.  Ranks with Brooklyn Lager as a great session beer. Enjoyable in most situations/constructions. A step above the Budweiser/Coors/Miller sort of thing but not unapproachable.

T- Nice balance of subtle malts and subtle hops. All the flavors one would expect in an APA are there, but nothing really pops. Similar to the Abita Restoration Pale Ale, but with a bit more intensity overall.  M- No notes on mouthfeel.

140,276,KYGunner,4,Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale is the consummate entry for the style. In what hits every category it does it with perfect example. From exacting body and color to perfect balance in scent and flavor SN does this beer right.  A pale ale should strike a balance between malt and hops and this does just that. Both scent and flavor has malt and hop appearances but neither overshadows the other to create an easy drinking flavorful beer.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,TheBrewo,3.94,"We pour a brew of deep gold. It holds a one and a half finger head of crisp, tight white bubbles, showing nice retention. Sheets and patterns of lacing are left as it goes, with a thick film left across the top of the liquid. No haze or sediment is noted, and carbonation appears to be active. The aroma gives pale, lightly wheaty, and metallic adjuncty malts alongside citric and sweetly nectary hops. Vanilla sweetness, raw honey, toast, faint pine cone earthiness, and turkey meatiness come out with warmth. Our first impression is that the flavoring is nicely hopped, with a hearty and classically “pale ale” base. As we sip, lemon zest, sweaty pale malts, soured adjuncts, baker’s yeast, gingerbread sweetness, and orangey citric hop sugars start things off. The middle peaks with pale muddiness, coriander and cinnamon depth, German lager malts, green grassiness, and mossy tree bark. The finishing wash shows mineral water, gravel, spicy earthy hops, white sugars, continued grassy hops, sesame seediness, and a revival of bitterly drying pale malts. The aftertaste breathes of lightly wet wheatiness, grassy and citric rind hoppiness, flashes of white sugars, red cherry skins, sweaty saltiness, and adjuncty coin. The body is medium, and carbonation is light to medium. The mouths is cooled and coated with an oily film. This eventually dries into a softer astringency. Each sip gives okay slurp and smack, with lesser froth or cream. The abv is appropriate, and the beer glugs easily.  Overall, what we liked best about this beer was its drinkability. This guy is a staple for the style, as well as for the craft beer revolution as we know it. The hops are robust and biting, while the aroma is decently fresh, mildly warming, and inviting. The flavor retains its strength with each sip, and invigorates the palate with its blend. This is a classic sipping beer, and something every beer enthusiast should be familiar with.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Roguer,4.19,"A - Beautiful, pale, coppery color. Lighter than SA-Boston Lager, but darker than a simple ale or lager. Small amount of carbonation; decent, 1 1/2 finger head, nice lacing.  S - Clean, slight pine, slightly citrus. Nothing overpowers, nothing stands out. Gives the impression of a very drinkable beer (which is spot on). Hoppy.  T - More pine and hops than a non-IPA has any right. A hint of citrus, but no strong individual citrus flavors. Not super-complex, and almost no sense of malts, but lovely and forward. The more I drink, the more a subtle sweetness creeps in. Did I mention pine?  M - This ale drinks more like a lager than any other. It goes down very easy, very smooth. The alcohol and carbonation content allows you to drink it as slow or fast as you desire. Try as I might, I can't quite decide to swirl it around much, preferring to just swallow it down.  O - This can easily, easily be a daily drinker type of beer. It's far more complex and bitter than a BMC offering; it's brighter and hoppier than Boston Lager (it's most obvious contemporary, for me); yet it still goes down very easy. It offers something new, whether you're new to the craft brew scene, or just revisiting an old friend. It may not be the most complex beer around, but it certainly has some interesting characteristics.  Heck, if you're reading reviews about SNPA, what are you doing?

Taste: Almost exactly like it smells with some notes of grapefruit and grassiness. The bitterness is very nicely balanced by the somewhat sweet maltiness in the background.  Mouthfeel: Very crisp and refreshing. Finishes clean.  Overall: Nothing about this beer really pops out and makes me go ""wow"", but by no means is that a bad thing.

A bit of underlying, bready malt character follows. Finishes with some subtle spiciness.  Taste: Citrus bitterness at the front of the tongue, flavors of grapefruit and orange rind. This is followed up nicely by some big pine flavor and a little bit of malt sweetness, providing a decent balance. Finishes with some light floral, spicy notes and a parting bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Good body to this one, gains a bit of an oily, resinous feel as it warms up a bit. Light carbonation and a slightly dry finish.

The taste is exceptional, and it's a classic pale ale, lots of pine! But what truly makes this beer excellent is the value. For what you pay and what you receive, one truly gets a bargain.  Put this beer head to head with any in its class, and it will beat them hands down. However, compare the price of this beer to those in its class, and it is every bit a bargain as you can find. For instance compared to Dogfish, which makes exceptional stuff, it crushes the competition. Dogfish will break your bank account to get some of their product.

Classic resinous pine bitterness that Sierra Nevada is known for, with some fresh cut grass and black pepper. Great hop flavors here from Cascade.

Poured clear till the bottom of the bottle, where some suspended particles and foginess entered the mix - my favorite part.  Smell- To my nose it smelled piney, resiny, and a bit citrusy.  Taste- Tasted much like it smelled; piney, citrusy, maybe a little grassy. I tend to like maltier brews. This Beer is not malty, caramely, nor sweet. I'd say more antiseptic, clean, and biting. Maybe it's just hoppier then malty. I did not review the beer till after my third time trying one. Third one was the charm, maybe an acquired taste for me. Definitely on the citrus side, pungent, with a bitter taste that lingers.  Mouth feel- Well carbonated. Smooth on the swallow, but a definite bite to the tongue.  Overall- This is my first review here. Overall it's a great beer. Has a nice bite. I personally like maltier brews and had to give this a few tries before really appreciating it.

140,276,barczar,3.79,"Pours a brilliant caramel copper color with a dense, foamy half inch ivory head that slowly correlates, leaving solid lacing.  Pine, muted citrus, and lightly toasted malt form the initial aroma. There's a bit of fresh cut grass, resin, and light floral notes.  Flavor reveals underpinnings of grapefruit and orange pith, with slightly bready, toasted malt at the backbone, carrying into a somewhat bitter, lightly resiny finish. Tastes a little watery, perhaps oxidized. Could be the tap lines. Skunky and floral hops emerge as it warms.  Body is moderate to a touch watery, with moderate carbonation, a touch of warmth, and slight astringency.  Very sessionable brew. Fairly balanced, but leans slightly toward the bitter/hoppy side.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Jugs_McGhee,3.5,"11.10.14:  B-  *** 04/12/17 impression from a can from the North Carolina facility (courtesy of Schlimenhaumer):  Definitely different than California-brewed Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Hop pungency is lacking, the body is lighter, water chemistry seems different, the balance isn't as dialed in.  Call me crazy, but this doesn't hold up to the original.  C+ / ABOVE AVERAGE  *** 11.11.17 rating (California-brewed version):  High B- / WORTHY *** 01/02/21 can:  38 IBUs. Brewed with Magnum and Perle as bittering hops, and Cascade for flavour (though I think this used to be all Cascade?). 5.6% ABV.  Vibrant copper body with brilliant clarity. Fluffy white head. Frothy and enticing.  Floral and citrusy with just about the perfect amount of concomitant hop bitterness for a pale ale. A scintilla of grapefruit. Faint hop oil flavour. Impeccably well balanced despite its assertive bitterness, which is gobsmacking at a scant 38 IBUs (for those who care about the whole IBU metric; I don't). 2-row malts give this a clean drinking approachable malt backbone without too much sweetness. Despite caramalt's use, it fortunately isn't noticeable in the flavour profile.  Slightly bready. I get a flicker of pine as this comes to temperature which I don't usually find in Cascade hopped ales...this beer makes its parentage of SuperCascade/Centennial hops easier to comprehend.  Ludicrously drinkable. This is the benchmark for the pale ale style, and a beer I buy every year. I do think Odell makes some better pale ales, and one can cherry pick better expressions of the style from across the country (e.g. Zombie Dust, Alpine-brewed Alpine pale ales, Daisy Cutter), but this remains the best pale ale out there with wide (i.e. near-global) distribution. I mean, I've seen this at a Walmart in Nevada for $8.99 a sixer...this is basically the beer to look for when you're in a craft/import beer distro ""dead zone."" A must-try for any pale ale fan, and as classic a craft beer as the U.S.A has ever produced.

Normally, we cannot get this beer in Alberta, but due to the fact that Vancouver hosted the Olympics in 2010 and Sierra Nevada was a sponsor of their alpine ski team, he was able to pick up a bottle from a liquor store in BC. It poured a nice ruby with immediate hop aroma, but underlying and very pleasant caramel malt. The lacing could not have been better and it just tasted awesome!

A well-balanced brew, however all the tastes seem to fall just a little bit short of where they are trying to go. I had the New Holland Hopivore APA last night, and I can confidently say that I think it was a more well-balanced beer.

140,276,tectactoe,4,"Pours a brilliant golden color, nearly amber; white head with some heft to it, simmers down quick but lasts in the form of lacing on the glass. Aroma is strong and solid; nice dose of American-style hops, leafy and earthy with a hint of citrus, on top of a huge malt canvas, full of some sweetness and bread-like yeast attributes. The taste is spot on for the style - west coast APA full force, leafy and earthy hop presence, mild bitterness which is both the king of the forefront yet overall mild at the same time. Mild citrus flavor in the form of orange peels and grapefruit - it's there, but not in large amounts. You'd swear the malt is given in nearly equal parts, as it cuts in about halfway through to give a nice sweetness full of rich barley and slightly toasted grains, with a finish that turns to the caramel aftertaste of the malt and the biscuity character of the yeast. Some lasting bitterness resides on the tongue, but it's relatively low and easily accessible, once again - great for this style. Tight, abundant carbonation and a medium body.  This is certainly a ""go-to"" APA when you're looking for something to sit back, relax, and drink a bunch of. You can certainly toss these back all day - great drinkability, tons of flavor. Also a great beer for introducing people to the world of craft beer, namely hop-forward beers, as it has a large hop presence but is relatively mild and far from overpowering, especially to a new palate. This is APA done simple, and done right.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,microbrewlover,3.56,"This brew pours a bright brown/orange color with a two finger head which settles into lacing which stays on top of the brew and clings to the glass until the end.  The smell is strong with citrus and floral hops. There is also a pine smell.  The taste starts with floral and citrus hops, a bit of mint, moves to sweet malts and carmel then finishes with a pine like taste. Pine hop resin stays on the tounge after swallowing.  The mouthfeel is bready and chewy, hop oils dominate.  This is an average Pale Ale, not bad just average. The mix of flavors that I am used to smelling and tasting with this style are not present.

140,276,danreitz,4.7,"Served on tap at Mona's in New York City. Pours golden amber with a floral aroma. The taste is marvelously balanced; there is just enough of that piney, slightly bitter cascade hop flavor is to counter the thick sweetness of the malt. Crisp, slightly citrus aftertaste.

Pours a bright and clear copper amber, with decent white head and lacing resilience. Mild, malt-forward aroma lacks many of the anticipated ""c"" hop elements. Flavours are also mild, a well balanced caramelized malt sweetness followed by some citrus notes and an inoffensive bitterness.

On draft, pours coppery gold, nearly clear, with a sizeable head that has good retention and lacing. Aroma is mostly citrusy hops; mild sweet and grainy malt underneath.  Flavor follows suit; primarily features the citrus hop notes of cascade and other C hop varieties; light caramel malt backbone; feels mild and lightly bitter after all these years of escalating hop bombs. Finish is mostly dry with lightly lingering bitterness in the aftertaste. Flavorful and easy to drink.  Medium body and carbonation; good smoothness in the draft version.

T - Bright hoppy front, slight biscuit malts underneath, all around balanced and sweet. Not overly bitter but maintains it's clean, refreshing hop pallet. Tasty start to finish. Full of flavor without being a sip-only.  M - Light syrup feel, active carbonation, very refreshing. Not thick compared to many pale ales, but still more heft than a lager. Nice and smooth.

140,276,jazzyjeff13,4,"An American classic - I can't believe I've waited so long to review this...  A 350ml bottle with a BB of May 2013. Purchased from a supermarket not too long back. This must have been one of the first US craft beers I ever tried - once you've had it there's no going back.  Poured into a straight pint glass. A rich golden-amber hue with fine sediment and medium carbonation. Yields a large head of creamy white foam that lasts for a few minutes before reducing to a patch surface layer. Nice lacing. Aroma of sweet caramel malt with a hoppy character. Notes of grapefruit, citrus and mild pine, along with a touch of grain. Lovely.  Tastes of sweet grainy malt with plenty of hops and a dry bitter finish. Notes of grapefruit, orange peel, citrus, pine, caramel, grain and dry yeast. Quite sweet, with a hint of earthiness in the background. A well-judged bitterness upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is smooth, dry and tingly, with a subtle spicy quality. Great body for the style. Somewhat astringent, with an aftertaste of bitter aromatic hops and sweet malt.  Superb - this pale ale well deserves the praise that it receives. Plenty of flavour yet so drinkable. A nice balance between the malt and hops; it errs on the sweet side yet this is offset by bittering hops and fruity/resinous aroma. Hard to fault really - a brilliant beer.

Taste: I remember drinking this when I first got into craft beer and thinking it was a bitter hop bomb. It's actually a very well balanced Pale Ale. Lots of biscuity malt and some nice earthy and citrus hop flavors. Both malt and hops share the palate and make for a very good APA. Smooth throughout and tasty without being too complex.  Mouthfeel: Smooth with medium body and good effervescence. Above average drinkability.  Final Thoughts: No complaints here. A standard in APAs. Would I drink it again?

T: Oranges and citrus notes right off the bat with malt flavors following not far behind. The hops and the malt are basically side by side in your mouth but not competing.  M: low to medium bodied with a silky smooth feel in the mouth. The carbonation cleans up the palate well.  O: This is a great beer and a must have in any fridge.

As it warms I am able to pick up some sweeter malt and yeast aromas. The flavor is citrus and pine though I can't determine which side of the hop coin it favors although both are present. The hops flavors are backed quite nicely by toasted malt. This has a nice balance between hops and malts. It finishes with some fruitiness which I'm guessing is coming from the yeast. It's light to medium bodied. Starts crisp then follows with hop bitterness before it sweetens up and then leaves with a dry finish. I love this beer and should be visiting it more often than I do.

I thought I would hate good beer in a can but since pale ale has always been a ""go to"" decent beer for any occasion, it's fitting that it's now available in a can. And yes, I'm drinking it straight from the can. There is something about the hole in a can that aerates the beer and gives it a novel texture and taste which I must admit I enjoy.

Research purposes and all...  A: Dark, golden beer with a finger's width of head that has a decent retention time and leaves a fair amount of lacing on the sides of the glass.  S: You can smell the cascade hops as soon as you pour it. Closer inspection yields a sweet malty backbone and a touch of grains, but not a whole lot else.  T: Sweet, grainy malts up front would would be potentially cloying if not for the solid thump of bitter hops with floral and grapefruit notes. The finish is quite dry, but the sweetness is still present on the back of the throat.  M: Moderately heavy body, almost chewy, with quite a bit of carbonation.  O: It's hard to be objective at this point, having had it so many times, and having tasted this exact same flavor profile in every Sierra Nevada brew. That being said, there's a reason that it's a classic. It brings big flavors, but keeps them balanced.

This one has got some taste!  mouthfeel: Medium body, medium carbonation that is style-appropriate.  overall: To me, this is one of the best American pale ale examples out there. It has a beautiful clear amber apperance, a nice malty hoppy nose, and a wonderful sweet maltly hoppy flavor that is quickly balanced by a wonderful hop bitterness.  comments: I think this is a great American pale ale - one of the best.

Slightly earthy and floral hops, with a hint of dank resinous pine (oh and theres even more dank). Light slick English malt is the difference. Marris Otter comes to mind, but I could be wrong.  Now this is a Pale Ale. Its like a perfect blend of English and American Pales. Slick English malt is a nice base for the hops to come out. The floral, slightly citric, and a dank hops go down a bit easier because of the mouthfeel. This is exactly how to use the signature SN hopping. Too much and it just gets to be a mess (reference my Hoptimum review).  I love the mouthfeel. I love how English malt feels, honestly.

Aromas of citrus sweet and herbal spicing on a roasty, caramel backbone. The beer is smooth and crisp in mouth, thanks to the carbonation and the hops bitterness. Flavors are roasted caramel and a touch of smoke in the backbone, supporting a resiny, bitter hops profile that highlights alongside a citrus blend of lemon and grapefruit. Very well balanced, with a bitter, slightly drying aftertaste that again showcases some of the herbal highlights. Smooth, drying finish with some of the bitter and spice left to linger until the next sip. As I said of the former Draught Style, this brew is a staple of the APA style. Very tasty, and very sessionable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,rickyleepotts,2.96,"They make this beer sound delicious… but it's really not. I mean, it's a good beer. But it's not a great beer by any means. This is a beer that is for someone that doesn't understand what craft beer is but wants to fit in at a party. Sure, Sierra Nevada makes some good beers. But this is just middle of the road in my opinion. I am impressed that a brewery can have such a hold on the market and that when someone thinks of a ""pale ale"" he or she generally thinks of Sierra Nevada. Sheryl called this beer, ""boring"". Can't say I disagree. But I will give this beer my FULL attention this evening.  In the Glass: I am really digging the color. It's a thick, rich golden color and reminds me of an imperial pilsner. I have been hooked on the Odell double pilsner. Tastes better on draft, though. The head is a thin white later on the top of the glass that just sits there begging to be drank. With as much as they produce of this beer, finding it is the easy part.  Nose: The aroma is that of a pale ale… subtle hop character with a simple, yet satisfying appeal. The aroma is nothing to write home about, and if they didn't tell me they used only whole-cone hops in this, I would never have been able to guess.  Flavor: It's been a while since I have had this beer, but it tastes about like what I remember. Initially there isn't much going on, then the hops start to work. It almost reminds me of an early IPA, and as my palate has changed, the expectations of a strong, powerful beer have also changed. Very rarely will you see me order a pale ale. After the subtle IPA overtones, it settles to a typical pale ale finish leading to the somewhat disappointing aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is decent. It has an almost creamy character on the tongue, and shoves some subtle carnation to the top of the mouth. Then you swallow, expecting some of those characteristics to still be there… but they're not. I guess for a beer that costs a buck a bottle, you can't expect much in terms of complexity.  Aftertaste: The aftertaste is nice, and while it sticks around for a few minutes, it dwindles from the second you swallow. It isn't as bitter as the book explains, but it's present reminding you that you are drinking a mouthful of hops.  This beer is decent at best. Since starting at Total Wine, I have been meeting a lot of people. Some are REALLY into craft beer, and others just want to get drunk on a Saturday night. This beer would be a good beer to introduce someone to that isn't into craft beer, but wants to understand what a hoppy, bitter beer tastes like. Sierra Nevada is a good brewery, but they have never released anything I feel was spectacular.  Sierra Nevada Pale Ale - The bottle says: ""Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is a completely natural ale. There are no additives, only the finest malted barley, whole hops, brewer's yeast, and crystal-clear water. The fine layer of yeast in each bottle is a result of the traditional bottle-conditioning process that produces carbonation naturally.""",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,SmashPants,3.62,"Bottle: reasonable brown bottle with an original and decent label.  Appearance: mid-amber in colour with a light haze. Disappointingly minimal head that doesn't last long.  Aroma: a typically APA nose of citrus, pine and a dash of caramel. A touch of herbs behind as well. An enticing prospect.  Taste: a little disappointing, actually. Not as full as the aroma, and a bit weak in feel. The good flavours do still come through, however, which helps keep this beer afloat.  Aftertaste: oddly, stronger on the finish, with a good dash of bitterness. Even better near the bottom of the bottle.  Mouthfeel: a bit weak in body. The flavour could have been carried better by a heavier feel. Light-to-medium carbonation is pretty bang-on.  Overall: a good quality American Pale Ale that is only let down by its lack of body.

Foamy on top even through the last swallow. Smell contains citrus, hops, yeast... the smell is slightly muted considering the rest of the beer living so loud.  Taste starts with a light to almost sweet hop note that immediately turns bitter but is complex in the finish as it throws spicy citrus, pine without much yeast flavor that is otherwise in the aroma. It lingers on the tongue for a long time, with the pine and hops tingling well after the beer is washed down.  This is one of my favorite brews, a trusted outstanding ale that I can find nearly anywhere in the country and never leaves me wishing I had chosen something else.

There's a nice head that stays at about a centimeter through the glass, and there's also some pretty nice lacing as well.  Smell: Muted. Faint smell of hops and spiciness. Pleasant, and not very strong.  Taste: One of the best pale ales I've had. It's definitely a pale, but at times it seems TOO flavorful. Obviously, that isn't a problem, but this is a damn good beer. Spicy, hoppy, piney, but not too much so. If the ABV were a bit lower, I'd love this as a sessioner.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, some good carbonation... feels like I had this straight out of the tap. Pretty good.  Overall, this is undoubtedly worth every bit of praise it gets. If I had the choice between this and their Torpedo though, I'd probably go with the Torpedo.

Almost fizzy at times and drying on the tongue with a burn in the throat.  I first tried this beer a few years ago, but it was skunked, in fact I had a string of skunked SN brews. Last week I bought it again, deciding to give it another chance. Saturday, I drank 3 of them, and though it wasn't skunked, I wasn't impressed. An off bitterness, and not much else.

Its reputation is very much well-earned, as it's a delicious, hoppy, refreshing beer that's pretty much perfect as an everyday pleasure.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,woodychandler,4.27,"This one completely amazes me - I will be its 2501st reviewer, not having reviewed it previously in any serving style; my mother lives in Chico and I have visited her on a couple of occasions, making my first statement more incredible; and the first person to review it from a CAN was my local CANTrader and fellow CANQuester (TM), tone77! It took me a while to find this in a CAN with Torpedo seemingly more accessible. SMH!  From the CAN: ""Purest Inredients""; ""Finest Quality""; ""CAN Conditioned"".  Just the Crack seemed to release a lot of hops aroma into the room. The inverted Glug really made it seem as though I had sprayed hops air freshener and I would be lying if I said that my mouth was not watering. I was looking at a massive two-plus fingers of dense, French Vanilla-colored head with excellent retention when I was done with my pour. Color was a deep amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was full of pine hops and now I was starting to drool. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, slightly viscous and the hops were soft, not overpowering as in some (many?) AIPAs. The melding of the hops with the malt was very pleasant and caused me to think back to the mid-1980's when I had this for the first time. I remember thinking that it was too bitter, but now it is just what the doctor ordered for this Jonesin' hophead. Finish was semi-dry and both pleasant and refreshing. I am so excited to see it being CANned and I would recommend it for anyone's cooler under any circumstances. Believe the hype!  Today is T, 04 June 2019 & I recently picked up a bottle at Rieker Bottle Works here in Lancaster, PA for other purposes, but a review is also suitable.  From the Bottle: ""Purest Ingredients""; ""Finest Quality""; ""Handcrafted Ale Since 1980""; ""The Pale Ale in your hand sparked the American craft beer revolution. Bold and complexwith pine and citrus notes from whole-cone Cascade hops, this Pale Ale was first brewed in 1980, and introduced a generation to the glory of hops. Our Pale Ale is still a classic and Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. is still family owned, operated, and argued over.""  I was kind of excited to Pop! the cap & get at this one, even if it was from a Bottle. At one point, well before national distribution, my mother brought a mixed six back to Lancaster, PA from Chico for my Pops as a sort-of Christmas present. He was less enthused than I was since he had never been much of an imbiber, but he deferred to my taste(s) & we really delved in, savoring what was then a special treat. Now, it is less of an occasion, but I feel the tug of nostalgia. I went on with a C-Line pour, forming just under two fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, tawny head with great retention. Color was Amber to Deep Amber/Light Copper (SRM = > 9, < 13) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a resinous, pine-like quality & my mouth set to watering. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was like seeing an old friend after a long absence - it fell right back into step with what I remember. Its pine flavor was not as intense as the first time that I tried it, but even with its more pronounced woody-like malt presence, it was still a darn good drink! I used to get it all the time while stationed at NAS Alameda, whether in Oakland or across the bay, in SF. Those were glorious, heady times from June 1987 to October 1989 & this was like liquified memories. Finish was semi-dry, but just right since this is really the guide-on bearer for the style. I was a little disappointed, at first, not to find it in a CAN, but as it turned out, I needed a Bottle review.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Alkey,4,"Poured from 22oz bottle golden color with finger of off white head and lots of tiny bubbles. Smell is sweet malt and citrus and grass hop aroma.

140,276,CheezyBlaster,4,"The perfect American Pale at the perfect price point? Almost, but the price and consistency nail this thing to the wall as the quintessential American Pale. Not to mention, it's probably the beer I've bought the most of in my craft career. Not quite sessionable, on account of the abv, but a great easy drinker.  Takes notes from the original English pale, but quite American with a tad more bright, crisp citrus and a bit more mild toasty grain. I don't think it gets better per dollar in the US.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,ZethOfTheNorth,4.22,"12 oz can from a 12-pack bought for $15.99 at Whole Foods, New Orleans. Poured into a wine glass.  A: Gorgeous frothy head. Dark copper, pretty opaque. Very handsome pale.  S: Obviously a hop-forward APA. Sharp grapefruit, then mellower citrus. Absolutely great for the style.  T: The worst pales are thin, weak, and watery. SNPA is none of those: it's immediately full, with distinguished Cascade hops on the back end. Citrusy, but not ""fruity,"" and certainly not cloying.  M: Maybe slightly more carbed than the average APA. Slippery texture. Lingering hops might be a bit sticky/drying for some.  O: As many have and will continue to write, this is a stone cold classic. It's almost always available (even in the beer black hole that is Louisiana), is always cheap, and despite how many times I've had it, I'm honestly still surprised at how excellent it is. Fantastic flavor, more sessionable than an IPA, appropriate for all seasons. Enhanced overall score for style superiority.  SNPA is the gateway.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Living816,4.07,"An exceptional example of streamlined simplicity in a beer style that is known for streamlined simplicity. This is beer that made Cascade famous, and it shows. A good lesson in how you can make something brilliantly colorful with just black and white ingredients.  It has a brilliantly piney, grassy, vegetative pop from the hops and carries through into the taste. There's a pervasive bitterness that rides above all else. It is something of a hallmark of Sierra Nevada, and you will either love it or hate it. The flavors a bit off balance, with the hops singing just a bit louder than the malt. In my book, that's okay. I am not a big fan of malty beers, especially pale ales.  You could make the argument that this is a borderline IPA in terms of stylistic components. It's not quite a simple pale ale pounder, and not quite an IPA sipper. But it's a little of both.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Gatch,4.19,"On-tap @ The Horseshoe Pub in Hudson, MA. Finally reviewing the quintessential craft beer & Pale Ale.  A: Copper-amber in color with a nice, off-white head. A bit of lace but no retention.  S: Malty, spicy and roasty with a hint of hops. More of an Amber/Red nose.  T: Big, pale malt, subtle hops. This is a true Pale Ale. Almost seems more English than American. I was surprised how un-hoppy it actually is. Earthy, spicy, hearty.  M: Plenty of carbonation, good flavor and body, and easy to drink.  O: The beer that started it all. I got away from it for many years and this reminds me why. Good beer but it just doesn't have the flavor I'm looking for. To each their own. A great gateway brew for any novice craft beer drinker.  2021: Revisiting this beer has changed my opinion…maybe they changed the recipe, but this is way better than I remember. It probably helps to not drink other hoppy beers beforehand but this is very tasty.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,zeledonia,3.85,"Bottled 2 July 2012. Tasted 14 August 2012, reviewed from notes.  Pours a very clear medium golden orange color. One finger of whitish head, relaxing fairly quickly to a thin cap, and leaving some nice little patches of lacing.  Smell is warm, malty, and crisp. ""Buttery"" comes to mind. Nice light piney-resiny hops (like those freshly grown, light-green spring needles) overlay that and add a nice bundle of variety to the basket.  Taste is a pleasant, crisp balance of malts and mildly bitter hops. This beer is definitely not over-hopped. Perhaps a little under-hopped, even for my tastes. But mellow, smooth, and tasty. Light grainy malts, some herbal hops. But pretty tasty.  Light-bodied, a little low on the carbonation. Finish is fairly dry. Good enough.  I can see why so many people point to this as an intro craft beer. It has lots of the elements of more extreme beers, but all in moderation and gently executed. A very restrained beer, and that's what makes it so good. I was prepared to be underwhelmed, but I wasn't.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Phyl21ca,4.05,Draft: Poured a medium amber color ale with a medium size foamy head. Aroma of citrus and piney hops is well balanced against some lightly sweet caramel malt base. Taste is also a wonderfully mix of floral hops notes from West Coast hops with nice line and citrus notes though they are never overwhelming. Malt base is not too sweet and well balanced against the hops. Body is about average with good carbonation.

This is one of the best beers on the market for its price, and it is easy to find. Very hoppy for a pale ale, with grapefruit, lemon, and piney notes and lots of small bubbles. Just enough malt to counter any slight bitterness from the hops, but this is a hop-forward, crisp, refreshing beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,khensley,4.12,"Apperance was as expected, with a thin head that kept as the beer disappeared. Color was a wee bit hazy straw yellow. Nice legs on the way down the glass. More sediment than expected from a big brewery, but I dont mind.  Smell: tones of grass, yeast, and a faint bit of rust.  Taste was impressively hoppy for a pale ale. Tasted a lot like an IPA with citrus, pine notes. Begining flaver had notes of graham cracker, the middle got grasssy, with a grapefruit finish. Malt was a bit thin, but the hop finish was delightful. The bitterness fades to a tinny aftertaste.  Mouthfeel was a bit big for an ale of this style. Plenty of little bubbles to punch the tongue.  Overall this beer is a solid one to buy when the selection is limited, and if you want to pair with nice hot sandwich. More like an IPA in my opinion. 24 0z. a serving is just right.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,TheRealBigC,4.2,"There is a reason why this beer has risen to dominance in the APA field. Sierra Nevada is known for its hops and this pale ale has a really wonderful hoppy aroma. The amber body and frothy head are quite appealing as well. Taste-wise, it's a blast of hops and a touch of pine follwed by an extremely mellowing dose of malts. In many regards, it tastes like the label: Green. This is not a bad thing, but I've found that it is not an everytime beer as a result.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Thick and creamy 3- to 4-finger head of good retention and very nice lacing. Carbonation bubbles drift slowly toward the top of the glass.  S: The smell is relatively subtle overall, with piney hops dominating and caramel malt notes in the background.  T: Starts off with a long buildup of sweet malt notes, followed by a long, resinous hoppy finish that lingers on the palate. The flavors here are very straightforward, but they complement each other well.  M: Light- to medium-bodied with a nice amount of carbonation. Finish is slightly dry. Stands up nicely to the flavors and easy to drink.  O: I can't think of many NYC bodegas that don't stock Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.

There is some good citrus notes to it, along with a little pine. The pale, bready malts give it a nice base.  The taste shows off the Cascade hops nicely. It's got notes of grapefruit, lemon zest and a little pine to it. Again the pale, bready malts give it a nice base and provide a good balance.

SNPA in cans! the crack and pour yields a very nice bright golden color, fairly good clarity, lots of carbonation bubbles rushing to the top. a big solid 2 fingers worth of head. very good retentive 1/4 inch layer is left the whole rest of the glass. decent lace.  sharp grapefruit citrus, grass, and a bit of grainy, very light caramel malt. maybe a bit more subdued than i usually remember, but im not sure how fresh this is.  grassy, grapefruit citrus, spicey hops, maybe a hint of pine in there. grains and a light caramel malt come in at the end to try and balance and then are washed away by a sharp, prickly bitterness.  clean and simple. love that mouthfeel. crisp, light feel, refreshing, prickly carbonation.  ive prolly drank more SNPA, than any other craft beer. this is and will continue to be my staple session beer, even more so now that it comes in cans.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,bshotbox,5,"I love this beer, by far one of my favorites. any trip into a bar with this on tap and it is a must have for at least one pint.

140,276,Auraan,4.47,"Poured a nice clear amber with a one finger white head that receded to a white ring leaving ample lacing. Pretty nice, very true to style. Scents of pine, citrus-zest, slight orange, biscuit-like malt, and floral hop notes. A nice balanced aroma profile of hops and malt, neither overwhelming the other. Very well executed and pleasant. Flavors of sweet malt, including caramel and toffee and some bready, nutty flavors, a moderate level of hop bitterness, with floral, pine resin and citrus zest hop flavors. The citrus zest comes through more on the finish. The finish is dry, with an almost woody flavor mingled with citrus zest and pine. Aftertaste it woody and modestly bitter. A very good, balanced flavor profiling combining hops and malt, with neither outshining the other. Very good. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate-light carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel. Very easy to drink with the right body for a good session ale. Overall this is a classic craft beer. Its balanced in aroma and flavor, both of which are very well executed in their constituent elements. The nice, smooth mouthfeel contributes to the beers drinkability and combines with the flavor and aroma to make a classic session ale. One of the best easily available craft beers out there.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Balanced and delicious pale ale.  M - Light-medium body with light, tingly carbonation.  O - Great citrus flavor with perfectly balanced sweet and bitter.

140,276,Hopstamon,3.83,"Big ups to the beer that introduced me to ""real beer"" as opposed to commercial rice beers that I was drinking in college. ""Fatty Sierra Nevada's...$2""... said the guy with a cooler perched on top of his skateboard...cruising the parking lot at a Dead show. I bought one...then another... it became a standard for what my tastebuds truly enjoyed. Hops... It is crisp and refreshing.  I don't buy this as often as I used to, but always try and have some in the fridge. Highly recommended for anyone trying to break into IPA's.

140,276,rdilauro,4,"Pours a nice golden amber color with a small but quick disappearing head. The aroma was nice. The normal citrus, grapefruit overtone for a Pale Ale, but I also picked up a bit of papaya and pineapple here. I kept coming back taking small but strong smells of this one. A little confusing. Now the taste, the fist sip was full a decent amount of hops and a smooth easy drinking beer. The aftertaste was lingering and about the same as the initial taste, so, to me that is always a good sign The follow on sips left me with a bit of bitterness at end, which I would normally associate with higher IBU beer. But even the bitterness was not something from a really high IBU beer. This bitterness sort of left a tingling on my tounge. And each sip afterwards left some tingling.  A nice overall America Pale Ale without being too hoppy for the average beer drinking but giving everyone a nice crafted beer",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Melikeydahop,4.4,"Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of this beer. I especially love it after having put it in the freezer for about 15 minutes before drinking it. If you haven't had this one ultra ice cold, you are missing out.  I like to drink SNPA right out of the bottle..it has near perfect mouthfeel which I think can be attributed to the bottle conditioning. I feel like it loses something when you pour it into a glass.  Yes, as you've heard a thousand times before, this is the beer that got me, and almost everyone else into craft beer. So it holds a special place in my heart and fridge. Since I first tried SNPA many beers have came in went in my fridge yet SNPA remains eternal. It's hard to describe the taste except to say it's just straight goodness. To be a bit more specific, it's a little dry, a little floral, a little citrusy, a little bitter, and not very malty/sweet, but it has just enough of a malt backbone..exactly what an APA should be. There may be a handful of better APA's out there, but chances are you can only find them in like 3-5 states, or they're only availabe once a year when the moon is full, and jupiter and saturn have aligned. SNPA can be found at almost every single liquor/grocery store. Many times when I try a 6er of something new I wish I just bought the SNPA. Which is why before I venture out into the great unknown of craft beer, I make sure I have some SNPA in the fridge just in case the next beer is better suited for the bottom of my drain than the bottom of my stomach.  Also...the perfect beer for a BBQ.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,TheSupremeAJ,4.8,"This is an excellent example of a pale ale. This is what got me into craft beer. One day (2 years ago) at the distributor I noted that I wanted to try something different, and that I didn't know where to start. The staff recommended a case of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, and noted that it was something nearly everybody could enjoy. I completely agree.  A- Light, fluffy, straw. Moderate white head. Visible nucleation of bubbles.  S- Clean, refreshiong, mild fruity hop aroma.  T- Moderate hop strength, balanced with bready pale malts.  M- Medium body. Flavorful and balanced.  I completely love the new can option, and I think they should just eliminate bottles. They are lighter, easier to carry, sunlight resistant, non-breakable, and they fit better in the fridge. They're also more eco-friendly.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,Siriusfisherman,4.5,"Appearance: A vibrant gold with some glints of amber and a glorious white head. Superb lacing and carbonation streaming from the bottom of the sierra nevada tulip pint.  Smell: Fresh grassy, spicy and citrusy hops combined with sweet and bready malt. Some toastiness is noticeable as well, and maybe a little pine.  Taste: Much more piney spicy in the hop arena, but still has a citrusy backbone. The malt is nice and sweet like on the nose, but there is a toasty and slightly lager like character as well. Just supreme balance and freshness, very hard to be satisfied with one sip at a time.  Mouthfeel: Very crisp and smooth, the carbonation really opens the palate for the big flavors that follow.  Overall: This is one of americas great originals, and it is still top class today. As someone that appreciates originality, it is hard not to mention this as one of americas greatest beers. It balances flavor with drinkability like no other beer in the world. It is the quintessential pale ale, a true american brewing achievement.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Not very strong, but highly drinkable and refreshing. Better than average fare in most respects. I've had better Pale Ales to be honest, but this is perfectly fine to drink at any time.

140,276,WeissGary,4.45,"This is an exceptional beer! It features a fantastic amber colour, a somewhat grassy aroma, and complemented with a ’bitter but sweet’ taste. It feels like this has a lot going on in terms of its taste, body and aroma. In terms of drinking, this beer has sipping qualities; a very easy to drink yet rewarding and complex beer!

This medium bodied beer has a rich fruity/citrusy and slight pine aroma.  Citrus-fruity-pine-grasses taste that has a slight sweet malt hidden in there.  A nice lightly dry aftertaste with some leftover citrus notes lingering on.

140,276,Goblinmunkey7,3.98,"Appearance: Clear light amber. Pours with a nice carbonation. Head is bubbly, sticky, and loose. Drops to a thin cap and collar in short order. Some lacing. Cap lasts for the duration.  Smell: Biscuit malts and spicy/citrus hops. Almost earthy. Something akin to salt almost. Pith and dry, dusty bread crust. Some sweetness punches through. Raw grain and very floral.  Taste: More of the raw grain. Cracker crumbs and bread crust. Citrus comes through and layers over a slightly spicy, almost herbal base. Earthy at times. Mellow sweetness helps to balance things out. More bread than bread crust, but it's all there. Faint dusting of that same salty thing on the nose. Works well.  Mouthfeel: Creamy with a dry finish. Carbonation is on the higher side of moderate and the body swings the other way. Lighter side of medium. Easily quaffable.  Overall: This is definitely the baseline for the APA style. Nice balance without ever overdoing it. Loses a little in the long run with the drying hop profile, but solid and always worth keeping around.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

M: Medium in body, the carbonation is certainly active, but not overpowering. Crisp and clean on the finish.  O: Overall a really good beer. Clean, crisp, refreshing.

Caramel and bready malt with some grainy flavors before shifting to a pine resin and grapefruit hoppiness. Not too intense but with a lingering bitterness and slick grapefruit on the tongue.  Average body with adequate carbonation. Sticky malt leaves a coating for the hops to act on while remaining bitter and attempting to dry.  The pale ale that is the standard to which many are judged.

Not too much alcohol lacing on this one, as expected for 5.6%  S- As it continues to warm up, I can pick up a little bit more from this pale ale. Hops and malt/caramel malt to start. Then increasingly more citrus or pine from the hops as it nears drinking temps.  T- Taste quite like it smells, which is both good and mildly disappointing. The taste is an amped up version of the smell, pine and citrus with caramel malts. Mildly bitter from the hops. Pretty standard for a pale ale.  M- Light to medium bodied. It is surprisingly refreshing and easy to drink with a finish that is somewhat on the dryer side. Really enjoy the mouthfeel of this brew.  O- Above average pale ale from Sierra Nevada. It seems like it is lacking in the smell department. The crisp finish and great mouthfeel of this beer make it a decent beer and coupled with relatively low ABV, it is a good session-able craft brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

T: There is a light flavor of caramel malt sweetness upfront followed by the not too intense pine hop and a light amount of citrus zest. The beer has a moderate bitterness that lingers slightly.

140,276,killianf,4.2,"I'm new to the style, so I had no real points of reference with the beer but I'll give it my best shot.  A: Pours a very slightly hazy orange-amber, with a foamy 2-3 finger head that dissipates quickly. Little lacing on in the glass, and from what I could see, not very active carbonation.  S: First impression in the nose was fruitiness. Some orange or lemon peel. Very floral scent, and the hinted presence of hops. The smell is strong, but not overpowering. It remains quite contained.  T: Hops with a peel or floral follow and aftertaste. Aftertaste lingers a short while and my mouth was watering beneath my tongue for another sip. I couldn't put my finger on it before until someone else mentioned it but there is DEFINITELY pine in here too, for me it was strong in the aftertaste.  F: More carbonated than I thought by looking at it, medium to full bodied. Slight dryness. Very drinkable.  Overall: A great introduction to the style for me. My focus would be on Hefeweizens and Belgian Strong ales but this has definitely got me wanting more PAs and IPAs, as well as more Sierra Nevada in general. Highly recommended and would make a great summer relaxation beer. Great taste and complexity but highly drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,briano81,4,"This is a great go-to beer, especially because it is often the only decent beer on tap at bars where you would expect to only find Bud, Miller, and Coors.  For what its worth, it has a pretty nice grassy taste and smell. If you're a real hophead, this won't do the trick, but I personally like it when I'm looking for a lower alcohol beer without stepping all the way down to something like, God forbid, a light lager.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,SilentCharlie,3.92,"A, Bright golden with a good haze to it but not too merky. Large bubbles coming up ti a fine white head that is hanging around.  S, Citrus with some pine, but mainly grapefruit on the nose. Little to no malt, this is all Hops!  T, Sits well in the IBUs, not too bitter but has a nice hit. again strong on the citrus but the pine comes through more in the middle of the draw with a slight sweet honeyness towards the end. Then in more with the bitter.  Some Alcohol on the Buuurp.  Very Dry! Very IPA, Very Hoppy!  M, Big bubbles, Medium/ light mouth feel. Standard for the style but perhaps more heavily carbonates than some.  O, A very nice beer of the style. A classic for a reason with some lovely flavours and aromas. Easy drinking and doesnt try to be anything it is not.  Great beer",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,TheCondor,4.17,"Picked up a six pack of this at the store a little late in the game. For many, this is the beer that converts them to craft beer, or one of the first they try…..however for me, that was not the case. Three times I have tried to order this brew on tap and have been thwarted, in three different states! It seemed I would never sip this brew, who has quite the reputation. But finally I did.  Appearance – Pours a nice clear copper color with a respectable two finger head that sticks around for about half the beer. Leaves pretty respectable lacing!  Smell – Certainly pick up the floral hops, the orange peel, the fruits real quick. A good strong hop presence in the nose, I love it. Just what I want and expect out of a pale ale.  Taste – Very balanced beer, excellent taste. Well done by the crew at Sierra Nevada, this beer deserves its reputation. Follows the nose closely but brings a nice malt balance to the taste, making the beer multi-dimensional. Big pine, floral, and citrus all backed up by the malts. Impressive.  Mouthfeel – Light body, crisp, refreshing, perfect for any weather or really any situation.  Overall – This is a world class beer. I am highly impressed, and as I have said, this beer deserves its reputation. I could drink this in the middle of winter in front of the fire, at a summertime BBQ, tailgating at Arrowhead, whatever. Very sessionable, an excellent representation of the style. I could drink this beer anytime.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

I haven't had a bottle of this in a while so I figured I'd grab a 12 pack of cans to revisit it.  A - Dark golden/amber body with rising carbonation. Fluffy 2 finger off-white head with a high level of lacing ad retention.  S - Lightly bitter with a balance of grapefruit and pine hop notes. A touch of bready malts towards the finish.  T - Similar to the nose. Great balance between piney and grapefruit hops. Slightly floral with caramel and bready malts. Lightly bitter finish that disappears quickly. Very clean and refreshing taste. Mouth feel seems a bit light for the style.  O - A classic. A really simple and clean pale ale that is highly approachable.

140,276,Kegatron,4.1,"12 oz can into a pint glass.  Pours a clear copper gold, with a couple fingers of billowy bright-white head. This retains with a frothy richness, as a big dollop of foam stays behind and rings the sides of the glass with sticky lacing. The aroma is bright feeling in the nose, with notes of leafy spice and fresh citrus flavor. Underneath sits the pale malts, which adhere to the citrus, really pushing it forward with an earthy twang in the nostrils.  The taste is fresh citric flavor and bitterness straight through the profile, which is smoothed out on the edges by herbal character and then buffered underneath by the bready sweetness of the malt, which like the nose, sticks to that green citrus character. A dry finish ends this with some leafy pith that sticks a bit. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a softer creamy slickness in the mouth that flows very easily, allowing those hops to give this the crispness that it needs to stay quenching.  Wow, I love this in canned form, as I swear this is the freshest tasting that I’ve ever had this beer and that includes on draft as well. Just crisp, well balanced, and easy drinking as can be and now super portable as well! I’ll be drinking plenty this summer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,TheSixthRing,3.73,"Appearance - Pours a clear, golden amber with an off-white, 2 finger head. The lace is decent.  Smell - Floral aroma, with some pine hop sitting beneath.  Taste - Sappy, pine hop. Only the faintest of citrus notes. Some malt sweetness, but gets overran by the hop. A bit of soapiness at times.  Mouthfeel - Light to medium body, with nice carbonation and bite. Dry on the finish.  Overall - Never been a huge SNPA guy, and truth be told I thought I was going to give it a lower rating than I have. Just not a big fan of the flavor profile. Too much pine hop in the mix, and the balance is skewed toward hop, for sure.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,littlelorib,4.1,"Slightly cloudy, orangish amber with a good two fingers of head and active carbonation. The head is steadily but slowly shrinking once poured. Delicious spicy, pine scent has me ready for a taste. Taste follows as advertised, with the addition of a light malt flavor. I'm favorably impressed.  Light hop bitterness, with hoppy flavors of pine and spice, complimented by a touch of malt = what i want in a pale ale.

Middle of the tongue you get that great bready malt backbone that balances the hop bitterness perfectly. At the back you get a bit more hop bitterness with a nice dry finish.

140,276,indiapaleale,4.2,"Reviewed from the can almost 10 years after my first review of this beer on BA...how the craft beer world has changed in that timeframe!  Pour - familiar amber golden appearance with very rich, thick white head on top that settles very nicely. Great looking pour coming out of the can, with the head leaving some lacing after the first sip. Looks like it came straight from the tap.  Aroma - floral and citrusy notes hit the nose right away. I've had so many bottles and pints of this pale ale that its like an old familiar friend. Love the slight hints of pine and light malty sweetness.  Taste - that first sip brings back lots of memories. Who hasn't had one of these during a great night out or at a great BBQ or party? Balanced malts and hops with a zippy, lemony zing and some bitterness that isn't too overpowering. A nice floral flavor with a solid malt backbone. An all around great beer for any occasion.  Overall - A time tested recipe that's hard to dismiss. Great all around flavor profile with the right amount of hops and malts to appeal to the masses. One of several gateway craft beers that has led many folks down the road to hopheadness.

140,276,dasenebler,3.51,"12oz, canned on 2/15/2012.  Pours a crystal-clear light amber with a tight, half-finger head. Retention is very good, decent lacing.  The aroma is oddly yeasty, with an almost sulfur-lager character to it. Some hops, but not much.  The flavor is nice, very clean. Crusty, bready malts are balanced by a hefty bitterness for a Pale. Some hop flavor, but not nearly as much as I remember with this beer. Subtle grapefruit and Cascade character. The mouthfeel is very nice, with creamy yet spritzy medium carbonation. Can-conditioning worked out well.  This is about as fresh as I've ever had SNPA, and yet I remember the bottles I've had in the past having a more robust hop flavor.

140,276,paulginva,3.97,"APPEARANCE: This beer, poured from a tap into a pint glass, produced a foamy off-white 1"" head that dissipated quickly leaving good head lacing. Carbonation was soft in a hazy amber body.  AROMA: Moderately piney hops were quite prominent along with lighter resin and grapefruit. Also a light grainy malt aroma.  TASTE: Moderate pine and light grapefruit, lemon and orange hops, together with a bit of grainy malt and just a hint of yeast.  MOUTHFEEL: This beer had a medium body with a smooth texture, soft carbonation and good body lacing that dissipated quickly. The initial flavor was lightly bitter with a moderately bitter finish that lasted for a long time, leaving a slightly bitter aftertaste.  DRINKABILITY: Probably the best mass market APA that I've seen (don't get me wrong -- Zombie Dust is the best APA I've ever tasted, but it's not exactly mass market). Well balanced, but quite hop-forward. An excellent session beer that I'll drink and serve again and again.

140,276,intensify,4.08,"Poured a honey colored body with minimul head and a good amount of carbonation. The nose was treated with a plesent smell of hops and plenty of earthyness. The hops aromas seemed to selfishly hold on to the aroma as I did not pick up much of anything else. Taste however was lite on the hops but thicker on the earthy flavour that most APA's tend to give. Interesting and satisfying. Body was medium to lite which ran down the palate with a good amount of carbonation. Finish is clean and quickly disappears into the back of the mouth leaving a moist feeling. A good pale ale by Sierra Nevada.

The beer has a delicious bite as the hops take over.  Ov: While far from the greatest beer, it invites itself as a sexy destination for novice beer drinkers converting to the wonderful world of craft. The combination of a beautiful bitter flavor, fulfillment and economic price point makes the beer a great full time option.

T: A very nice balance of hops and malt flavors. A ry nice sweet flavor that allows just the right amount of bitterness to come through.  M: Excellent carbonation with a slight hop bite.

Felt sandpaper on tongue with the carbonation being high and watery mouth. Finished slowly with bitter hop taste remaining. Overall I was stepping outside my zone on this one.

Slightly outdated, but I’m doing this anyway.  Look: Poured a huge fluffy 3 finger off-white head. Color was a semi-clear amber. Carbonation bubbles were steady but nothing too crazy. There was a good amount of unexpected sediment in this bottle.  Smell: Strong citrus with some floral and herbal notes. Base malts were noticeable in the background.  Taste: First was a light lemon peal. Then a hop bitterness coated the entire mouth. The finish started with a somewhat spicy note that led into more of a juicy citrus that eventually became dry.  This is basically a tamed version of SN Torpedo. I personally feel this beer sets that standards for all Pale Ales.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

O- I have been on an imperial beer kick, so this was a big switchup for me. It doesnt have the big aromatics and robust flavor of the IPAs that I like, but it is a solid Pale Ale with a fresh, clean flavor.

140,276,VaterRoss,4.08,"12oz bottle into tumbler, bottled Dec 20th 2011 (this took some detective work)  Appearance is a clear copper with a surprisingly large white head and nice visible active carb. Leaves some nice lacing at the top. Smell is lightly floral and a tad malty (this may stand out due to the amount of IPAs I've had of late). Taste is spicy, floral hops, with some nice pale malts to back it up. Taste ends with a nice clean and sharp bitterness from the hops. As I get farther into the beer the malt comes out more and is actually quite pleasant and mellow with some light biscuit notes. A barely detectable hint of funk (old?) comes in on the taste, again, this is just barely there and doesn't really detract. Mouthfeel is medium-light and a bit prickly from the hops.  Light, refreshing, but featuring lots of taste and hops. I really like this beer; one of the first non macro beers I encountered with wide distribution and near cheap pricing. Incredible quality given the amount they ship! The gateway beer as far as I am concerned. Fairly high drinkability but a bit too bitter to be prime, if only the hops came through a bit stronger.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

M: Medium body and medium carbonation; creamy; no detectable warming; neutral finish.  O: I've had this many times previously without thinking much about it. It does hold up well during evaluation and deserves its place in the pantheon of craft beer. It's refreshing, clean-tasting, crisp, etc. -- all the things the BMC offerings have promised, but has so much more substance and flavor. It's a dependable, solid, go-to beer that is ubiquitous and a terrific value, to boot. It delivers a great deal for its modest 5.6 % ABV.

A - Very slightly hazed with fine particles, constant carbonation flows up from the etched hop nucleation point to the huge three-finger egg-shell colored, densely packed head. The beer itself is a deep goldenrod color. Overall appearance is near unbeatable as the well-formed head diminishes slowly leaving lacing all over the glass.  S - Crisp floral hop aroma that has a touch of spiciness - a bit of pepper perhaps - with a solid sweet honey and pale malt base. Crisp and light but sweet and robust. Very well balanced.  T - The hops impart a citrusy, pine flavor that lingers for quite a while. While the hops are the obvious showcase for this beer, the malt base does a good job of supporting the hop flavor and bitterness. The background has a lightly sweet touch of honey aspect to it.  M - Crisp and citrusy right away, the malt base comes in to round it out to a medium body but the hops finish out dry and moderately bitter. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is very refreshing.  O - This is an incredibly crafted Pale Ale with great drinkability - it's one of the superior examples of the style available and a classic. Bottom line, it should be tried by all.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Philousa,4.33,"Pours a pale gold, clear, with one finger sticky head. The rocky foam clings to the glass and laces well for a pale. The tart yeast aroma is clearly evident upon opening the bottle, but disappears soon after. I get sweet, sticky pale malt, toasted biscuit made with honey. Piney fresh hops sit atop, wafting easily to your nose. The initial sweet malt flavor is fleeting as bitter hops and yeast flavors take over quickly. The yeast starts tart and serves as a smooth transition to the bitter piney, earthy hop flavors. This is about as full bodied as a Pale Ale can get, with middling mouthfeel and a medium finish.  I'll make no claim that I am currently an acolyte of Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale. I'll tell you a secret, though: I hated it when I first had it in college. I was into nutty, watery beers (read: Newcastle), and this tasted like soap to me. I didn't always get along with hoppy flavors, it seems. Now I can't imagine a better stand by, go to beer in a jam. Thank you, Sierra Nevada, for making such a palatable, robust ale that is available nearly anywhere that a boring tasteless InBev product is served.

140,276,nickthetick,4.44,"A: pours a clear golden orange into a DFH Off-Centered glass with a finger and a half of dirty khaki head that hangs around for a bit and is continuously replenishing itself.  S: wonderful dark citrus greats the nose with a burst of grapefruit, sweet oranges and lemon. There is a distinguishable malt aroma of biscuits, caramel and honey.  T: much the same as the nose the citrus is the most formidable taste on the palate but is not overbearing on the sweet malt notes that make up the backbone to the beer.  MF: a medium to light body with a great effervescence, crispness and very refreshing.  O: the quintessential pale ale, the one I bring to all the parties and enjoy quietly at home. The almost light body keeps it very drinkable and the malt qualities keep the palate fresh to taste the next one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Nice white cap the dissipates but remains present & good lacing down the glass. Smells like beer - Nothing overpowering. The taste is clean and balanced with Med to higher carbonation and good mouth-feel with a bit of a bitter hop lingering. This beer is easy to find and a solid option for any occasion.

S- citrusy hops upfront, orange and grapefruit, something a bit grassy there too, a malty sweetness present underneath the hop character.  T- straight up a touch of sweetness, followed by the hops, grapefruit, lemon to begin, and grassy/herbal to end. The bitterness comes through afterwards, not over the top, but there is a fair bit of bitterness there.

Bitter upfront but then a creamy sweetness comes through with a light caramel malt, grainy but very smooth and is slightly toasted. Finishes dry with a clean bitterness.  M - Lively carbonation, creamy medium body, dry finish.  To date I have consumed more of this beer than any other craft beer by a long shot. It's a simple go to beer that has stood the test of time.

Geez...even after I acquired a taste for craft, it was even longer after that I acquired a taste for Sierra Nevada and damn was the wait worth it!  Really, this is the staple Pale Ale. Better for my palate than the other readily available Pale Ale Mirror Pond. The only Pale Ales I prefer over this one are ones that call themselves Pales but really drink like IPAs. (Alpha King and Drake's 1500 to name a few especially these days)  Doughy and grainy malt bill with a nice floral Hoppy pop, finishing bitter and earthy...just how I like it.  Similar to PtE, still argued the best of it's respective style even though created years and years back. (SNPA WAYYYY back further than PtE but you get the picture) There has been plenty of time to improve upon the style but hard to improve upon the benchmark.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

T: again with the good malt presence. Hops are muted compared to some of the west coast pales ive had. Citrus pops up in the end with a bitterness coming through to keep it balanced.

More noticeable than on other beers i've had.  The smell is farely mild. Nice floral hops up front with grains in the back.  The taste follows very nicely. The hops aren't over powering at all.

140,276,hiku7,4.2,"Pours an almost clear gold to amber with a creamy head that revives easily with a swirl.  Grassy and grapefruit citrus hop aromas up front, followed by a bready malt. Clean yeast character: no esters or phenols.  Flavor has a smooth bitterness that is moderately assertive throughout, but doesn't linger much. Some citrusy hop flavor. Bready and toasty malt. Very balanced beer by today's pale ale standards.  Slightly grainy mouthfeel, bitterness dissipates quickly leaving a moderately dry finish, but less dry than many pale ales. Creamy foamy carbonation provides some body and a smooth mouthfeel.  It's a classic. Still worth returning to. Very drinkable too.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,OremLK,4.65,"Poured from bottle into pint glass straight from the fridge. Nice and cold.  A: Gorgeous. Absolutely gorgeous. Dark golden, just slightly hazy. Just a hint of haze gives it the appearance of depth without looking dirty. Medium head which fades down to a slim foam coating on top and lingers and lingers throughout the entire glass, leaving beautiful lace along the sides.  S: Floral, pine, citrus, slightly sweet. Beer, beer, beer. Scent really jumps out and tickles the nose with anticipation and enhances the smell throughout the glass.  T: Follows the smell, but without the big bitter bite you might expect from the aroma. And that's just to my liking. Pine is probably the dominant flavor here, but there's plenty of citrus and floral flavor as well, and some notable malty sweetness especially as the beer warms up. Dances on the tongue. Delicious.  M: Light and drinkable, but enough malt backing not to feel watery at all. I've had a sore throat the past few days and this has done a nice job coating it with its foamy malt goodness. Moderate carbonation.  Overall, this is what a beer should be. I could easily see myself drinking two of these a day for the next month and not getting a bit tired of it. Moderation is difficult with beer this good!

140,276,ExtraStout,4.5,"I've had this brew many times. Luckily, when most places stock only the standard crap, I am fortunate to find this lone beacon of quality due to SN's great distibution system. Although I am a bigger fan of their Torpedo Extra IPA, I have no issues with this Pale Ale.  Dark golden color, long-lasting and just slightly off-white head. Above average lacing. A touch of yeast clouds the glass when swirled and poured into a pint glass once the head recedes far enough.  Malty sweet, but balanced by the grapefruit zing of Cascade hops. Not as bitter as other APA's I've tasted.  Very drinkable, the hoppy but fairly sweet taste and classic ale mouthfeel bring the bottom of the glass all too quickly, this beer was exceedingly good for the style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,TempeBeerMan,3.65,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  A – A crystal clear golden yellow with a two finger white head that disappears very quickly. Head has kind of a “dish soap” appearance. Decent clumpy lacing.  S – Strong aroma of extremely floral, piney hops.  T – Tastes like it smells; piney and floral. Slight citrus twang in the middle. Not dank or earthy at all. Grassy. Airy. While the hop character is indeed tasty, ultimately it’s almost all this beer has. Not much in the way of balance. Finishes extremely clean.  M – Nice carbonation for the style, but ultimately the beer is pretty thin and even a little watery. From the taste I would guess this comes from a complete absence of malt. (Ok, just kidding, I’m sure it has malt, but you can’t really taste, smell, or feel it. Just sayin’)  O – While the comments above would suggest I didn’t like this beer, I've drank a lot of these in my day. This is an absolute perfect beer for a 118 degree Arizona day, and I feel I could easily down an entire bottle without stopping. Also, would make a great “transition beer” from adjunct beers as this one has good flavor but it’s presentation and profile is so mild I couldn’t see it scaring anyone away from craft beer.

Good malt back. Such a well made beer all around.  T- I remember when this thing blew my mind as a youngster. Like how could I possibly drink more than one? Obviously this has changed, in huge part thanks to drinking SNPA until it felt normal to drink more than one or five. Piney, citrus undertones and a nice smooth balance.

Smell is hoppier than expected with notes of herbs and citrus and a very light malt in the background. Would like better balance. Taste is at least similar to the scent in that the malt takes a 'back of the bus' approach with the hops driving. Light citrus (grapefruit) note accompanies the heavy herbal/floral/medicinal hops. Less balanced than the nose. Medium bodied with a somewhat sharp effervescence in the front. Dry finish, astringent. Hops mellow in the aftertaste but remain the main ingredient.

Nice and balanced with malt and breadyness.  The taste is really on par with the aroma, but there's more bitterness here. Pine, floral, and grassy hops go well with the moderate bitterness and balancing caramel/caramel malt and bready notes.  The consistency is smooth, almost velvety. The carbonation is medium. The body is medium as well. And the finish is on the lighter side of medium. Very nice mouthfeel/dribkability.

I get some bready tones as well. Nose is simple but good.  T: Moderate hops up front with a nice mildly sweet malty finish. Certainly some hints of caramel but these pale in comparison to the hoppy bitterness.  M: Nice. Mild carbonation, smooth, refreshing.  O: A great beer, easy to drink. It is not complex, but is very good. Would certainly recommend.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,RobertColianni,3.75,"A: Pretty standard for a PA. Orange, a little lacey.  S: It smells like weed. Just straight hops, but faint. It's sweet, too. Intoxicating.  T: Again, pretty standard for a PA. It's well done. A little dry, slight citrus, and decent sweetening hops. A nice sugary crystalization is there.  M: This is where this beer really does it. It's thin, but crisp. Extremely bubbly. Tingles on your toungue. Goes down fast and kicks the back of your throat like a coca-cola. Awesome.  OVERALL: I've had this beer on tap quite a few times and never understood why everyone said it was so good, but this is my first bottle. Maybe I always had bad tap lines, because this beer is amazing. It's a safe beer done perfectly. Love it.

140,276,vandemonian,3.75,"Sierra Nevada Pale Ale tastes like hop water to me. There isn't enough malt character for balance. It also has a weak flavour that tastes almost like... chlorine.

140,276,iSip,4.03,"Sierra Nevada Pale Ale: Got my hands on one. Usually I like to have a few before I do a review, but one will have to do. The Sierra Nevada has a deep copper color with aggressive carbonation. The slightly off-white head is thick, even and lasts to the end without a lot of lasing of the glass. Flowery hops are big in the aroma and in the flavor. Under the hop flavor there a subtle undertones of malt, and the finish has a bitter aftertaste, but in a good way. The Sierra Nevada is a solid offering that a beer drinker or any style will appreciate.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Pours a delicious almost lemon yellow golden body with a huge Bolshie white frothy head that settles down put stays the course.  The bite of the hops is unrestrained in the aroma backed up with malt biscuity notes and sea breeze.  The flavour of this beer just lands on the tongue to perfection, a big hop hit without overpowering the floral tones and peppery bites.  Perfect, I mean perfect carbonation.

Nose was delicious pine and citrus. No mistaking the hoppiness here. Yum.  Taste was more pine, some grapefruit.

It consistantly tastes great...never disapointed that I bought it. I dont think I need to go into all the characteristics here...we have all had it.

T: Starts with a little bit of biscuity malt before opening with a solid bite of NW hops. Has a floral, piney character that merely tingle your taste buds, rather than attack it with scissors. Not my favorite tasting beer, but it still works perfectly.  M: Good carbonation with a proper feel on the palate. Dry finish makes it a great pairing with spicy/zesty/bitter food.  O: It's a craft beer classic for a reason, people. All the refreshment you'd expect from a pale lager, but far more satisfying to drink.

140,276,StonedTrippin,3.82,"the sierra nevada flagship brew, what can you really say about it that hasnt already been said? iconic, special, and a beer that drinks as well as it thinks, genre defining to say the very least. more of an ipa than a straight pale ale by modern standards, but a delicious beer nonetheless. a complex and robust hop nose is enticing, fresh when at its best, and the balanced flavor, medium body and effervescent carbonation make this a staple in most good bars. this is much hoppier than other american pale ales, but is not heavy as some can be, even with the crystal malt body and northwestern balance as they call it. it is highly drinkable with a slightly bitter finish and an extraordinary crispness for what it is. the colder the better for me, a little less delicious when it warms up, so drink it swiftly for sure. one of the very first beers to define what cascade hops taste like, spicy and quintessentially northwestern and high alpha. well ahead of its time, often copied but rarely equaled. the american craft standard anywhere you go, and rightly so.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Immediate citrus aromas, especially grapefruit. Also a floral (rose) scent with a hint of hops. Very pleasant smelling beer.  The immediate taste and mouthfeel of the beer is very smooth with enjoyable hops and citrus flavors. However, the end is a tad bitter and sharp.

140,276,BeerNoobNC,4.45,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass. Small layer of yeast at the bottom of the bottle after pouring.  I'm not as well-versed with the Pale Ale as I am with the IPA, but this seems like a special beer. The beer poured a very hazy, light orange color, like an IPA but a little lighter. Everything about the smell is citrusy.  Much like the smell indicates, there is a pretty heavy citrus flavor. This citrus flavor balances the hop flavor very well, though the hop flavor is dominated by the citrus.  From what I remember of the pale ales that I tried before I began reviewing on BA, this one is special. It is very drinkable, as I could easily have several of these in a row. Also, if the hoppy beers are not your thing, this would be a good beer to start yourself acquiring that taste.

No more BMC for me after that. I was going to save the review for something significant but six years is long enough!!!  Poured this old friend into a pint glass. Pours a light copper/golden color with a big white head on a hard pour. Retention is good and there are some rings of lacing on the glass.  Aroma is citrus hops, very nice. Taste is great. This is the quintessential every day Pale Ale. Nice balance between malt and citrus/piney hops with the hops leading the way. A good hops bite but overall subdued bitterness, a true APA not a mis-labeled IPA. A few of these at one sitting is a beautiful thing.  Mouthfeel is rich, crisp and provides a good hops bite within an overall balanced APA. Overall a great beer and one that is available everywhere to be enjoyed. Like Old Rasputin, the wide distribution should have no bearing on how good these beers are.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,hoptualBrew,4.38,"100th review! Chose to save this classic brew for my 100 - just an amazing beer & available nearly everywhere. Gotta love Sierra Nevada for putting out a quality product on such a large scale.  12oz bottle to my Duvel goblet. Crystal clear rich copper color with a stacked off white head that laces the sides of the glass. Very nice here, looks refreshing! Waited a minute to let the yeast settle on the bottom of the bottle then pitched it in as well. Yeast floaters all over it, suspended in the brew as if time has frozen.  Mostly all floral hops and pale malts in the nose along with a light caramel like sweetness. Not overpowering in aroma, but just enough to make a statement & claim itself as an APA.  Hop bite up front - floral with a good amount of lemon and a light nutty caramel malt backbone to fill in the skeleton. Mouthfeel is smooth & mildly ""soap-like"" aftertaste, but in a good way (if that makes any sense).  Overall, this is an absolute staple to the craft beer world & was one of my first true craft beers. It holds a sentimental place in my heart & on my palate.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,kdawg105,5,Excellent Pale Ale! Sorry Sweetwater must say they have you beat in this department. This is a smooth beer with a bite of hops in the finish.

Fresh moist hops are immediate on the tastebuds, grapefruit galore, but very well balanced with malt sweetness. Light prickly bitterness afterwards.  This is a Pale Ale that is very drinkable yet flavorful, wouldn't mind having several.  Overall this is everything a Pale Ale should be. Kept within it's limits, but loaded with character.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,fsvan,4.3,"Bottle poured into New Belgium globe.  A- Bright golden, with a tinge of orange. Lively carbonation leads to a couple fingers of barely off white head. A lovely looking beer.  S- That piney hop smell that dominates many of the SN hoppy beers, but not without a malt backbone to stand up to it to keep it in check. Barely. Slight citrus notes lurk behind, but you have to bury your face in there to make them peek from behind the pine. A superbly hoppy smell for an APA.  T- Piney hops again dominate, in a way I always expect from SN pale/IPAs. As with the smell, the hops are backed by a nice amount of maltiness, but not too much.  M- Medium bodied, perfectly carbonate.  O- SNPA is the quintessential American pale ale, the forerunner of the style. Is the absolute best? No. But after years of challengers coming forward, SNPA still stands its ground, refusing to budge an inch. That this is so affordable and so easily attainable makes it easy to forget how good of a beer this really is.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,mocktm,4.05,"Review #100! Good to see it'll be one of the beers that really started it all for me.  Golden orange hue, sports a creamy white head that clings well to the glass. Some sparse sediment is in the bottom of the bottle from the bottle conditioning.  Earthy floral like aromas up front, mixed with orange rind and some spiciness to complement the malt backbone. Meshes really well to create a very favorable balance.  As with the nose, a variety of flavors combine their efforts to produce a hell of a beer. Moderate spice and citrus underneath an assertive hop bite, all atop a malt sweetness that acts admirably to round it all out.  Medium bodied and slightly creamy, this beer just tastes incredibly clean, like mineral water. A widely distributed semi-main stream gateway beer; as sessionable as it gets.  I honestly don't know if there is a better beer that gets the distribution this one sees.

Some lacing left on the side. Smell of hops and pine notes. More hops upon tasting, not overwhelming, but enough to get the point across. More pine notes, maybe a hint of citrus (almost grapefruit-esque). Some malt and barley mixed in as well.  Dry mouthfeel, definitely has you wanting more!  Overall, an impressive 4.5/5. Highly recommended, and a fine beer to enjoy year round.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,TheBeerAlmanac,3.83,"Bottle poured into a pint glass  A: Pours a bright golden hue and settles into a slightly darker yellow with a puffy white cloud of head and just the right amount of retention.  S: Aroma is lightly malty with crisp sweetness, just a touch of yeastiness and has some lingering hop bitterness with citrus and pine notes.  T/M: A medium to high amount of carbonation and a bright, brilliant body. Some slight bitterness is introduced up front followed by a refreshing bit of citrus hop and a biscuity, pilsner-like finish.  Not exactly a complex brew, but very revitalizing; the ideal pale ale. This is the go-to beer when you want something light.  TheBeerAlmanac.com",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,vancurly,4.3,"Amber, frothy white head, which persists, nice bubbles from the bottle. Aroma of grapefruit, caramel, marmalade. Big malt hit initially, with citrus & lychee, followed by caramel, with the bitter finish. It's a like a parade in your mouth. The overall effect is one of finely-tuned balance. For me, this beer was becoming mythical.... so much good written about it, but I couldn't find it in Australia. Finally, I came across it, at the excellent Leura Cellars. One of the best Pale Ales I've ever had.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,endovelico,4.64,"Poured into Nonic glass. Reviewed under medium high natural light. Best before 14/08/11. Reviewed on 22 / 09 / 2011.  Appearance: Pours a hazy orange-copper brew with small off white head that collapses immediately leaving a medium size cap. High apparent effervescence. decent lacing.  Smell: Medium high intensity aroma. One would expect a trampling grapefruit/lemon aroma, but this isn't the case at all. Excellent balance of brisky aromas, grapefruit, lemon, light malts, caramel, flowers, pine, maybe a touch of grass. It's so lively and imponent yet balanced and delicate.  Taste: Medium intensity. Obviously, you're going to be getting hops, the thing is you get so many layers of flavours from the hops alone, that you cant help but feel marveled at the complexity achieved.  You get the citrusy flavors, you get resiny flavors, you get some of the pine and briskeness from the malt. Having said that, these are pretty common notes associated with american-hop heavy brews, the key, in my opinion, is in the fantastic balance. Each sip brings forth a different more evident note, to the point that you feel you're drinking a variation of the same brew each time.  Mouthfeel: Medium to Medium high bitterness (it would probably be higher if it were fresher). Medium bodied. Medium carbonation. It is coating and goes down smooth leaving a earthy / citrusy aftertaste.  Overall: Great example of what a APA should be in my opinion. It's so well balanced and rich and you can't really expect vast creative intrepretations of an APA so i really cant fault it for not having a unique over the top gimmick tecnique, ingridient or flavour. It's an APA, and it's a darn good example. Thank you Sierra Nevada Brewing co.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

This pours a nice clear golden color with a foamy white head which leaves behind a little lacing. The smell is of pine and citrus hops, a little caramel. The feel is medium to light. The taste is initially of piney hop flavors, a hint of grapefruit and some caramel, there is some bitter afterflavors but this is very crisp and not as fatiguing as a super hopped IPA (which I love).

140,276,PappaT,4.03,"This beer being the classic example is still a very good session beer. The Aroma is slightly flowery with some hints of 'green'.  The Taste is pleasant and almost balanced between the citrus hop flavours and the sweet malt.  Mouth-feel: Carbonation is at a level where is helps bring out the hops without being pushy or prickly on the tongue. The beer's viscosity is slightly on the light side, which means it is very easy to drink and does not make much of it self while in the mouth.

Smell: Great balance of sweet malt and piney, citrus hop's.

S: Piney hops, slightly pungent but not out of whack. Underneath that are some grassy hops and just a touch of citrus. Nice toasted malt presence, but not carmelly and sweet.  Smells like an APA, not overwhelmed with hops.  T: Very balanced, good bready/biscuit quality to match the piney hops.  The hops are herbal and spicy too in a sense.  There is a decent bitterness but it's an afterthought on the aftertaste.  MF: Good body on this one, almost medium and feels like an IPA or a bigger bodied beer; slightly pithy.

140,276,Jadjunk,4.13,"#113. So I've been away awhile and focusing on my beer reviewing efforts, so I felt an appropriate return to my reviewing notes would be with a universally reviewed and well known beer. I can't for the life of me figure out how the freshness dates works, but I do know it is good until sometime this year. It is hard to believe that I found this beer too ""intense"" in my early days as a beer drinker, but it has, like beer in general, grown on me as an essential icon in the craft brewing industry.  I poured this 12 oz bottle into the standard Sierra Nevada Tumbler Pint Glass (I felt that the hop tulip would have required more beer, around 16 ounces in order to be properly used and reviewed in). Served under 51 Degrees F.  (Appearance) Pours a slightly frothy 2 finger depth head and hangs for a couple of minutes. The surface takes a while to clear however, and a medium level of lacing drapes the sides of the glass. Color is a medium golden amber. There is a little bit of carbonation in the center and the beer is mostly translucent. For this most part, this beer looks quite appealing. 4  (Smell) A very pleasant blend of pale malts, some grassy hops and maybe even a even slighter tone of citrusy hops. The smell is rounded out well, however the potency is not all what I would expect it to be, and that's a shame. Overall it is a pleasantly enjoyable aroma and very worthy of a good drink. 3.5  (Taste) Deliciously balanced. A crisp, light and faintly sweet caramel malt base is rounded out by a complimentary citrusy and grassy hop character. There's a bit of something for everyone on both ends of the hop malt spectrum, but this beer manages to blend the best of both worlds into one delectable assortment. The nearly indiscernible alcohol presence make this extremely quaffable. It might just be one of my favorites from Sierra Nevada. 4.5  (Mouthfeel) The tiniest bit on the crisp side, but again wonderful balance. Each sip awakens on the tongue but is not overly active. There's a light/medium body to this beer and a well concealed alcohol presence. Masterfully done. 4.5  (Overall) One of the finest offerings from Sierra Nevada (I have a hard time finding something that tops Torpedo and Celebration, but this ranks up there), this is a great beer and a must try for even casual beer drinkers. Highly drinkable and thoroughly enjoyable, it will not disappoint even the most mainstream beer lover. 4",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Common becnhmark here in Oz is Little Creatures Pale Ale and this easily meets, if not slightly exceeds that benchmark.

140,276,boilermakerbrew,4.03,"A- Pours a semi-hazy full golden color. A sizeable foamy head that sticks around for awhile. Lacing is good and consistent throughout.  S- Definitely a hoppy overtone to the smell. Pine and citrus aromas are prominent and enticing to the nose. Just makes me think of the pacific coast, I don't know why.  T- Starts off like the smell, pine and citrus. Then hits you with the hops. The level of bitterness is a little over the top, but finishes without aftertaste and a very clean feeling left on the palate.  M- Heavier than anticipated. Still a manageable beer to have a few of if you are having a meal. Definitely a beer that enjoys the compliment of a meal.  O- For my first review of an APA (or IPA for that matter) it was a good experience. Not too much on the hop side to scare me away from more bitter beers, but enough to give me a taste.

Taste is extremely well balanced between the hops and malt. Simultaneous flavors of bready, biscuity malts with some slight sweetness followed by or in tandem with hop bitterness--pine and mild citrus. Also a slight herbal flavor.

140,276,paxchristi,4,"Sierra Nevada is a classic microbrew staple and this is their premiere beer. Its the essential gateway into craft beer, and I could not speak more positively about our friends in Chico. They have found a niche and it is serving them well in the microbrew/craft beer cult. Their consistency is out of this world; probably due to their commitment to bottle conditioning.  Appearance: Pours a good looking beer. I expect this from my pale ales. Golden amber with a good amount of head-- 1.5-2 inches that leaves great lacing down the side of the glass. Totally professional.  Smell: Earthy, grainy, biscuit front infused with hoppy intensity in the nose. Definite esters. I even caught a grassy/leafy smell in the undertone.  Taste: HOPS! Body is medium filled with citrusy tones-- near a bit salty yet still earthy. There is something behind the hops that gives it balance but I do not know what to call it. Total bitter finish matched with an earthy tone that brings it balance. Classic.  Mouth: Dances in my mouth. Hops sticks to the palate and the nose. Even carbonation gives this beer is a strength of this brew. It brings out the bitterness of the hops and gives the hoppy stick to the palate a stronger effect. Brilliant.  Overall: An American classic. Enough said. This is always be one of the go to beers for me. This is the poster child for American Pale Ales.

140,276,IPA35,4.15,"Poured this nice looking golden ale into a a pint glass. Slightly hazy with a foamy head. good visible carbonation.  It smells of pine resin and citrus (lemon) and the malts is a light caramel. Inviting.  The malts are a bit weak tasting, more bready than robust/caramel as with the Anchor Pale Ales. The hops are fruity with a average bitter, hoppy aftertaste. Some sweetness in there but the hop takes over quick. Not very complex but it is good and very easy to drink. That was the first pour without yeast. Now the second half. It mellows down the flavour a little prehaps? It leaves some brown stains in the otherwise white head and there are some brown particles in there that have sunken to the bottom by now.  It has a medium body, not thick but not watery either. Just fine. Under average carbonation.  I think I prefer the Anchor offerings for flavour, but this is even more drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Some slight lacing remains on the sides of the glass.  S: Caramel and biscuity malts dominate the nose. Some slight citrus is present as well, rounded out by some hop bitters.  T: Sweet malts and caramel flavor burst onto the tongue at the outset of the sip. Bread crust and biscuit meld into flavor profile in the middle followed by some citrus of orange peel and grapefruit and hop bitterness in the finish.  M: This is a light to medium bodied beer. Carbonation is pleasant and refreshing.  Overall, this is an excellent pale ale. The flavors are complex and well balanced.

140,276,ummswimmin,4,"Sierra Nevada pale is one of the original craft pales in wide distribution. This was one of the gateway beers that got me into craft beer drinking as a hobby. It is easy to drink. It tastes really good, and it isn't too complicated.  I haven't had this beer in many years, and it was really nice going back.  The coloring is a nice shade of copper with a minimal amount of head. Carbonation was present, but it wasn't over-whelming.  There is light hoppiness coming off the top and in the taste as well.

T - buttery malt and rich hops - bitter hops in there and some citrus/floral hops in the mix as well, but doesn't overpower the malt base.  M - medium bodied, smooth nice mouthfeel.

It is almost always my go-to fallback beer at chain restaurants when the rest of their beer list is limited to a variety of low-quality American beers from the large breweries.  It has a nice tan-orange coloring, but a mild (and pleasant) taste and smell.

I never thought it was particularly remarkable, but it gets so much praise on the forums here that it was time for another shot. A nice golden orange color with a small head, not much retention a tad of lacing. Smells not overly exciting, but its good, a little citrus and pine and some bready malt. Taste follows the smell with a very mild hoppy bitterness and a hint of citrus. Pretty carbonated and a nice light mouthfeel. Very easy drinking beer, a great intro to craft, and unlikely to offend anyone. Not my favorite APA, but certainly one I'll keep buying for a long time.

Tasted slightly better than the smell. Initial taste was malty and citrusy, but not too much of either. Immediately followed with an aftertaste of alcohol. Each flavor complimented each other.

A small, thin layer of foam tops the beer.  Smell: Sweet and malty with brief hoppy aromas. It's definitely on the fruity side, with scents reminiscent of oranges and lemons.  Taste: As pale ales go, this ranges more on the maltier side than the hoppier. Never mind that, though, as this is a damn tasty beer! The tastes of citrus are full-bodied, and the malts are good enough to provide a thick, grainy experience.  Mouthfeel: Every time I take a sip of this beer, I feel very relaxed, as it is gentle on the palate. This is due to the hops not being strong at all, as well as it tasting more fruity as it warms up. The carbonation that maintains itself throughout further maintains the soothing experience of drinking this beer.  Overall: While I prefer the more hoppier varieties that Sierra Nevada has to offer, this beer is nevertheless a classic in craft brewing that deserves all the praise it's received.

It was over a decade ago that I was in college and a dormie said I gotta try this danky stuff from Chico! Should have made this my very 1st review now that I think about it but here goes.  *Popped with my Sierra Nevada Opener and into my pint  A: SNPA pours a clear copper pale...leaning more towards that golden straw hue with a frothy 2 finger off-white head and some very classy lacing.  S: Smell is a bouqet abundent with citrus and florals and as I reminisce there was just nothing like it at the time it debuted.  T: Taste is just sooo good and wins me over every time with it's balance. That citrus and pine hop combo that I find in other brews made classic by this one right here. A light bready cereal malt base. Slight caramel sweetness. Just so refreshingly crisp and hoppy deliciousness.  M: Light sticky body and creamy texture make for an overall great mouthfeel.  D: Can't say enough about this brew. Super drinkability. It's hoppy but not offensively bitter. It's malty but not overly sweet. Just great balance and a for sure crowd pleaser. The beer for me when I go camping, fishing, vaca, etc. And one of the few brews that the wife and I can both enjoy togther. In fact I had a keg of SNPA at my wedding in 2004.  Truly a beer that is standing the test of time. It's only been downgraded here because of so many new amazing beers that have no doubt spawned from what is SNPA IMO. Never dissapoints.

Slight pine and dried hop leaf aromas with a bit of estery fruit in the malt. Nicely balanced malt and hops with a medium body good carbonation due to the bottle conditioning. A nice lingering hop bitterness that makes its presence known but is not overpowering. Funny how tastes can change, when I was younger and new to beer this beer seemed so bitter to me now after years of drinking what seems to be hoppier and hoppier beers this one barely registers.

140,276,ithacabaron,4.55,"Original Review, 2003.  12 oz. stubbie, into a pint glass, alongside a 3 pound homemade turkey sandwich...mmmm.  This beer pours a burnished, golden amber in the glass. Aroma is fresh cascade hops all the way. The initial taste is almost like sucking on a cascade hop leaf, the flavors are so bright and simple and singular -- but there is a generous portion of malt that backs it up, balancing the beer perfectly.  The malt profile is what makes this such an excellent session beer. While it supports the hops, it never becomes overbearing, allowing the appriciator to sip many of these in one session. Additionally, the freshness of the hops makes this beer perfect for cleansing the palate in-between bites of food.  If I weren't a poor college student, I'd keep a sixer of this in my refridgerator all the time. Seems like it would be an excellent beer to convert macro drinkers with.  ---  Re-review, July 2011. Numbers adjusted appropriately.  Pours a fantastic copper with soft orange highlights. A nice foamy head soon settles down to a thin cap. Excellent lacing appears down the side of the glass.  Aroma is soft and mild, mellow malt, fresh grass, dill, and candied grapefruit peel.  Taste expands into a buttery, smooth, golden syrup. At the end of the swallow, a firm (but not harsh) dimple of bitterness appears, a whisper of freshly squeezed citrus, a hint of pine sap. There's an immediate invitation -- but not a necessity -- to take another sip. Wondrous.  Mouthfeel is appropriately pillowy, a cascade (ha!) of warm surf.  This beer has held-up through the test of time; if anything, the ever-expanding palate of choices -- it seems like a new craft brewery opens every week -- has only magnified how excellent this brew is. More importantly, Sierra Nevada hasn't dumbed their Pale Ale down over time. This is, and remains, THE platonic ideal of American Pale Ale.

Clearly an American PA (in this respect and others). Light. Worth swishing over the tongue once or twice.  Overall: One of the better brews a gentleman can find in nearly every liquor store in the country. My favorite example of the american pale ale. Strangely won a few awards for english pale ale even though the hops are obviously american cascade and the beer is very bubbly.

140,276,Lightbearer2012,4.13,This is a historic day as I am posting my first ever review on BA and I chose this beer because although I try new beers all the time Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is always in my fridge. Why? Because this beer has replaced Budweiser as my go to. I remember trying this beer about 20 years ago and thought it was horrible. My how the palate changes.  12 oz bottle poured into a standard pint glass. Beautiful orange color with a nice fluffy head.  The smell is light and fruity with a nice hop aroma. Nothing knocking my socks off fragrance wise but smells of quality.  The taste is great and I like the balance of malt and hops. Again this beer tastes of quality and care in the brewing process.  The mouthfeel is great to me if a little light but that is one of the best features of this beer- drinkability! Perfect carbonation and ridiculously refreshing!  Overall I love this beer and for $12.99 a twelve it is a no brainer.

S - Semi bitter hops in the nose. A good balance between citric and floral hops. The malts balance it out even more with a touch of honey sweetness.  T - Taste is soft and bitter with some honey undertones and a bitter orange bite. Finish is mostly bitter but with very pronounced orange flavor.  M - Mouth feel is medium bodies with soft carbonation and a smooth finish.  O - Not a bad beer. Lots of good flavors and the mouth feel was great.

140,276,BerkeleyBeerMan,4.03,"Appearance: I pour a 24 oz. bomber of Sierra Nevada Pale ale, the old stalwart of American craft beer intro a shaker pint glass. It's a mellow 57 degrees out,a little chilly for a July night in California so I think this beer is a perfect choice. The beer arrives in the glass as a consistent medium amber with light yellow undertones. The opacity of the beer is medium. It looks a tad watery and bubbles rise throughout the glass for a long while. The head comes in at a nice full foamy inch. It's very light tan in color. Eventually the head diminishes and then retains at 1/4 inches, thinning in the center and leaving a ring of light clinging lacing.  Smell: The malt presence is upfront. The blend of pale and crystal malts works well to create an aroma of toasted biscuit with a definite sugar presence. However, this beer isn't sickeningly sweet, a quality I usually dislike. There are aromas of dried fruit, tannins, raisins and caramelized sugar. Perhaps it isn't far fetched to also appreciate a leafy quality in this beer. I think this would be a great autumn beer. The cascade hops are piney and citrus. Floral and spicy flavors emerge in the background. A highly present flavor is grapefruit. The bitterness isn't appreciable until sipping.  Taste: Upon sipping this beer I find that the taste profile is fleeting. The malts come quick and then disintegrate into a nice but depreciating slight bitterness. It isn't a huge mouthfeel of flavor but it does hit all the fine points of the style. In addition to the usually citrus flavors, a grassy presence is detectable when tasting the beer. There is a emergent flavor of cocoa. The bitterness is mild, but becomes cloying when the beer warms. Pale Ale should be served at it's proper temperature. Since this beer is relatively low ABV it lends itself towards being sessionable.  Mouthfeel: The water base seems to be distilled. The ingredients are good but lack subtlety. The balance is fine, albeit it does lean bitter. With time the beer develops a slight chalky texture. The finish is clean and sharp.  Overall: This is the archetypal APA. I will always pick this beer up when it it the best possible choice, but because of it's lack of distinguishing characteristics will lean towards more interesting options if they are available. A great beer to introduce to craft beer novices if they are bold and want to try something with notable bitterness. A legend for it's consistency.  Mouthfeel: A medium bodied sticky chewiness that fizzes in the mouth. Finishes bitter. Refreshing.  Overall: I find it hard to knock this beer. It may not be the most interesting beer ever AKA the next best thing but it is a great introduction to high quality craft beer. I will definitely be using Pale Ale to introduce my friends to craft brew. Everyone had had this beer which validates it's reputation. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is one if the best APA's.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,WanderingFool,4.18,"Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is one of my go-to beers when I'm at a non-craft bar, need a beer to share with a variety of friends or just want something to relax with. I'm surprised I've never reviewed it until now.  The beer pours a clear amber color with a small frothy white head on top. The foam dissolves quickly to a thin sheet on the surface, leaving behind numerous spots and lines of lace. From the bottom of the glass a steady stream of bubbles rises rapidly to the surface.  The aroma is rather faint with notes of orange and lemon citrus and pale malt.  Each sip of this light to medium bodied beer is slightly creamy with a firm carbonated feel. Finishes dry. The flavor is a nice balance of citrus hops and sweet malt. It starts sweet with flavors of caramel and pale malt. This is followed by mellow flavors of orange citrus and a touch of lemon zest. It finishes moderately bitter. Once gone the orange citrus and sweet malt lingers on the palate.  This is such a well balanced, easy drinking beer. I could have a pint every day of the week and not get tired of it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

S- A light floral small. Smells more like a pilsner.  T- Hoppy and mild. Good balance but somewhat dry.  M- very light, but still decent body. Hops leave the mouth dry. Slightly bitter.  O- Solid go to beer. Light and hoppy plus available year round. Not my favorite pale ale, but good.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

The next night, I just wanted them out of my refrigerator so I decided to finish the other 3. Big change from one night to the next. The first night, They seemed to taste like chilled thin cough syrup. But the next night I poured them into a pint glass and it is like the flavors mixed and matched and moved around to produce a rather tasty beer.  A - Pure transparent Orange color with off white 1 finger head that dissipated in about 2 minutes, leaving a light lace.  S - I rate all beers a 3 because of my lack of the sence of smell  T - Strong, lightly bitter and almost like sourdough bread.

Had to have something to drink while playing pool, so I figured I'd revisit this old classic (and finally review the damn thing). It pours a clear brass topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises grass, flowers, lemon peel, orange rind, and very light toffee. The taste brings in more of the same, with the more citrus-y hops gaining in potency a bit, balancing out the earthier ones pretty nicely; all while the toffee doesn't give much ground. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly dry finish.

Mouthfeel medium, well carbonated and otherwise quite perfect.

Slight fruit upfront like I described in the smell along with hops. finishing mostly with hops.  MF-Not bad. Some hop aftertaste. Leaves sort of a residue but not a bad feel or taste at all.

140,276,doktorhops,4.07,"Another American beer, this time a highly recommended one... do not disappoint me Sierra Nevada. I'm looking forward to the hoppy APA I've grown to love in Little Creatures, and I've heard much talk regarding the American micro-brewer scene on the west coast, so here goes!  Poured from a 12oz (what's that in ml's?) bottle into a tulip pint glass.  A: Looks a treat. Like most APA's I've had before: slightly cloudy honey coloured body with a nice white head that leaves minor lacing in the glass.  S: Hell yeah! Floral hops lead my nose to an ale paradise with a hint of caramel malts in the background. The balance here is sublime - nothing overpowering, but the hops are definitely the champion here.  T: It's good, not great but good. On the front palate there are tangy hops, biscuit malts, which all blends well with a caramel sweetness: very nice. The back palate/aftertaste is where it's let down; hops that would otherwise have a chance to shine merely end up as a bitter twang that upsets the foundation of flavour set out from the beginning. Like I said: good but not great.  M: The texture is where I find real sparks of brilliance - the body is perfect, mid to heavy with carbonation representative of the style (low to mid), and a slight oiliness, top marks here!  D: I started out the review comparing this to Little Creatures Pale Ale, and it that respect it is a letdown, however overall this is a good representation of the style that with a little finesse with the hopping could be as great as LCPA... (or even better). To me this APA is a missed opportunity, a great malt base let down by overtly bitter hop flavours in the back note. If it weren't prohibitively expensive over here in Australia I would definitely drink it as a back-up to LCPA though.  Food match: Hearty food would suit this brew well, roast game birds and salad with a celeriac puree and vinaigrette...

Nothing too over the top, just a solid nose. This one might be a bit old.  T - Starts off with a nice, light, citric hop kick quickly giving way to a mix of caramel and biscuit from the malt. It has a good overall balance of flavors. Finish has some hop bitterness, lingering for a short time. A tad old but still very nice.  M - Light body and flavor with moderate carbonation.

Decent head, with equally decent lacing, however I would say the appearance does the overall quality of the beer some injustice.  Smell - extremely light smell, but one that is captivating. In my opinion, hints of fruits followed by copious amounts of hops.  Taste - one word... EXCEPTIONAL. It has all the boldness and body you could hope for, coupled with hops and a perfect finish. One of the few beers that I would say combines the refreshing taste of a mass market light beer and the sophistication of a craft beer. Perfect balance. Truly one to experience.  Mouthfeel - quite nice actually. not as thin as one would expect, but once again its simply one part in what makes this beer truly ""off the charts"" good.  Overall - great beer. My 2nd time out of the bottle, however had many on tap (strongly suggest you seek that experience out if you have access). I whole heartedly recommend this beer.

140,276,metter98,3.88,"A: The beer is clear dark golden yellow in color and has a light amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a finger high dense off white head that died down and consistently left a thin film covering the surface and a ring of bubbles around the edge of the glass. S: There are moderate aromas of citrusy hops in the nose. T: Like the smell, the hops stand out in the overall taste, but these contribute a light to moderate amount of bitterness that is kept in check by the underlying malts, which also contribute some hints of toasted malt flavors. M: It feels a bit shy of medium-bodied on the palate and somewhat crisp with a moderate amount of carbonation. O: The beer is very easy to drink, refreshing and is quite sessionable. I would have no problem drinking more than one of these at a time.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,shaunb81,4.17,"I must say that I'm pretty excited to grade this beer. I have had this beer quite a bit, but have never actually graded it and I am proud to have it in my hand...  Appearance - Poured a little amber/copper body with some serious bubbly action going on. A nice one and a half inch head is apparent, which disappears pretty quickly into a lumpy, foamy mess on top. It looks quite tasty though. Medium lacing is there as well.  Smell - There are some bready and sweet malts on the front line. The hops are pretty significant and they have a faint citrus and floral scent. I want to drink this beer even more now.  Taste - So a slight sweet malt hit me on the front and was followed by an AMAZING hop presence. Dry, floral, and slightly citrus hops took over my palate and never let go. This stuff is beautiful. Nectar, to say the least.  Mouthfeel - Body was light/medium and the carbonation was medium as well. I didn't expect anything less from a pale ale.  Overall - I must say that I really couldn't find anything wrong with this brew. It was tasty, looked really good, and had me coming back for more. I was really happy to find this at the gas station next to my place too. I really can;t think of a better pale ale off the top of my head.

At first taste I was overwhelmed with the hop bitterness. I just was not expecting it, but after a few sips, this beer started to grow on me. Hops up front but with a creamy, malty mouthfeel. Very well balanced. Finishes dry with some bitterness.  Overall - A very good pale ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,CHickman,4.67,"Pours a clear yellow gold in color with a massive 2 finger foamy off white head that fades very slowly and leaves great foamy lacing sticking to the glass; the beer leaves foam rings after each sip.  Smells of floral hops, flowers, piney hops, sweet malt, brown sugar, grains, biscuit, grapefruit, citrus hops, herbs, light lemon, wheat or light yeast; the hops really take over most of the aroma, and allow just enough malt and grains to come through for a perfect balance.  Tastes of floral hops, flowers, piney hops, sweet malt, brown sugar, grapefruit, orange peel, citrus hops, herbs, light lemon, biscuit, wheat, grass, hay, light yeast and tea or some chewy hops floating in the mix; this is a pale ale that always borders on an IPA, and I love it.  Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with a zesty tingle on the tongue, a medium body, light carbonation and a slight bitter finish.  This has been my favorite beer since 1994, and is the reason I started exploring craft beers. A very high recommendation, as this beer is consistently good and always enjoyable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,lookitsmp,4.33,"appearance: Pours a nice light orange color with medium transparency. A small half finger white head diminishes down to nearly nothing. Not a bad looking brew.  smell: Malts, hops, and some very vague citrus scents. The smell doesn't really stand out from others of this style, but it is good none the less. I can't wait to take a sip.  taste: Begins with a nice biscuity malt taste, moves to a nice bitter jolt from the hops, then finally a very smooth and crisp malt finish. This is a very delicious pale ale.  mouthfeel: On the fence between light and medium bodied with fairly low carbonation. The hops dry your mouth a bit but overall this brew goes down very smooth.  overall: This is an excellent pale ale with a good balance of hops and malts.

S - superb citrusy mix of hops and strong biscuit malt, smells fresh as can be  T - a favorite of mine. great initial surge of malt and subtle hops gives way to a stronger mid sip hop bite. But my favorite part of this beer is the distinctive strong clean and HUGE malt finish. Every first taste of this beer is an exceptional treat and has never failed me  M - smooth and lightly bubbly, no real complaints  D - this was one of my first beers that I had after getting into beer in general and has only gotten better for me over time. there is no food this doesn't go with either.

Signature pale malt, faintly biscuity and not quite toasty with a vague vegetal undercurrent. Smooth light herbaceous hops with maybe a hint of orange peel.  Pale malt up front; bright and crisp on the palate with a musky/bready/faintly metallic flavor mid-way through. A touch of hemp is suggested by the hops along with a mild bitterness. Quite dry finish.  Moderately carbonated, light-bodied, with just enough heft for substance.  If you like their signature malt, you'll be pleased, otherwise there isn't a lot here to hold your interest compared to the dozens of superior examples of the style.

M - This is a fairly dry ale, but not too dry. Carbonation is pretty low. On a scale of 1-10, carbonation is probably about a 3.  O - This is a great tasting Pale Ale, one of my favorites.

140,276,SkunkWorks,4,"On tap at the Country Corner in Setauket, NY. Served in a pint glass. Its been quite some time since I've had a Sierra Nevada pale ale and I don't think I've ever given it a fair shake on tap, so here we go.  Look: copper body with a thin, slightly off white head. Good retention and good lacing.  Smell: a little grain with a good amount of citrusy hop aroma, and the Cascade hops really stand out to me. Simple but inviting.  Taste: grapefruity, citrusy, fruity hops and a little caramel maltiness to balance it out but keeping it hop forward. One of the more aggressively hopped straight up pale ales you will find and for that I am grateful.  Feel: medium bodied, dry with a lingering hop bitterness, carbonated well, refreshing and a good beer for a session.  Overall: good beer. No wonder it has stood the test of time. Drinks light a light IPA rather than an APA and thats definitely a good thing, since APAs typically leave me wanting more. If you haven't gotten around to this beer yet, what are you waiting for?!

140,276,BarryMFBurton,3.95,"The two Sierra Nevada creations I’ve had so far (Torpedo and Bigfoot Barleywine) were damn good. And this one, their ever-so-popular Pale Ale, has quite the reputation. So, before I even begin, I guess I have to admit that I have some pretty high standards for this particular brew. In any case, I’ll try to be as objective as possible. And, even if I end up disappointed, I’m sure I’ll be glad it was hyped up – that way, I got to explore this beer with a discerning eye.  A: Wow, a lot darker than I expected. Sure, it shines, but the body is more of a tree-sap amber than the typical PA light gold. Looks fuller-bodied than most – I like it a lot. Its foamy white head appears and then thins out almost immediately after the pour, leaving a classic, sudsy ring near the top.  S: A mild nose with a lot of complex hop aromas. The main component is a bright leafiness, but you can tell there are a few different hop varieties imbedded within: there’s bits of citrus, flowers, and spice here and there. Some yeast mellows everything out with a nice bready undertone. Great stuff.  T: The hops are elaborate and flavorful. An excellent blend, showcasing freshness, spiced bitters, and a rich dryness. The yeast is velvety smooth and provides some welcome breads to the mix. It’s a good and mellow experience. The only thing I can perceive as a negative is a bit of an unnatural feel in the wheat. It’s carried out with a slightly artificial undertone, like a BMC. It’s odd, because the other Sierra Nevada offering’s I’ve had were not at all like that. Now that I think about it, I also paid more for those. Anyway, it’s not excessively noticeable, and doesn’t impede the drinkability a whole lot. Overall, a very sessionable beer (technically, it’s 5.6%; but who’s counting?)  M: Good; nice upfront carb permits greater drinkability. Some watery notes here and there, but that’s only a very small percentage of the time.  O: I can’t believe this beer only cost me ~$16 for a 12-pack. You can hardly find Buds for that cheap! Certainly a great deal. Like I mentioned before, though, I did have high standards for this beer. Now, I’m not going to say I was disappointed (because I wasn’t). In fact, after having this beer, I find myself wishing we had more breweries like Sierra Nevada! All in all, this is a clear example of SN’s willingness to create the best beer from whatever ingredients they have, and then putting it in the same price range as many highly-commercial counterparts. I can certainly respect a brand like that. In the future, though, I’ll pay the extra couple bucks and get their Torpedo Extra India Pale Ale if I’m looking for a PA with a great price tag.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Arknot,3.75,"The ulitmate ""beer"". A nice balance of hops and malt, this pale ale fits my standard for a basicly perfect everyday beer.  Appearance is light copper with a thick white head.  Smell is hops and watery freshness, with a slight biscuity breadyness.  Taste is slightly bitter hops, with a nice biscuity bready malty body.  Mouthfeel is nothing heavy, very crisp, and very easy going.  Overall, If you enjoy american hops, and a want a solid beer to have with a meal, out in the sun, or hanging out with friends Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is the ticket.

Poured 3/4 straight, then swirled the remainder to stir up the bottling yeast for the final 1/4 pour.  A: Orangy-gold colored, somewhat cloudy due to the bottling yeast, with nice 1-1/2 finger frothy white head. Gorgeous matrix of lacing on the glass that sticks around quite a while. Maybe the best lacing I've seen from any beer.  S: Citrusy and floral hops hit the nose first (rose petals), with a yeasty biscuit aroma hiding behind. Orange peel, mild grapefruit. Yummy.  T: Follows the aroma, citrusy/grapefruity hops prevail with a fair amount of non-sweet malt to back it up. Hints of orange peel once again with a cleansing bitterness to finish it off.  M: Adequate carbonation to carry the flavors, cleans the palate up nicely and finishes very dry.  O: A true classic. No aftertaste to speak of, the palate is left completely cleansed after each sip and ready for another. The hops dominate with just enough yeasty goodness to balance it out.

140,276,thebrood1987,4.75,Very nice looking Pale Ale and has an excellent smell of clean hop orange fruitiness I'm guessing from the cascade hop and some fresh pine smells as well. This is a very smooth beer which has a slight crisp spicy bite with the rich bready caramel malt taste in the middle and then ending with that fruity orange/pine like bitterness from the hops. Perfect amount of bitterness for such a refreshing beer. The hop smell and taste reminds me of Oskar Blues Dale's Pale Ale.  As it warms I'm getting some more tastes from the hops other than just the orange fruitiness. I can taste some tea and herbal flavors as well which tastes excellent. Perfect craft session beer.

140,276,harrymel,3.83,"Bottled: 106310724; March 4, 2011  A: Pours a golden orange ale with brilliant clarity. Less than single finger of fine white foam falls to a medium sheet of the same. Spotty, but persistent lacing.  S: At two months old, the beer isn't nearly as nice smelling. I will give it a bit of leeway provided they at least give me a date (albeit annoyingly written), and allow for some deterioration. The beer is predominately malts at this point. Fairly sweet, with some piney hops in there still.  T: Sweet malts win this profile. Actually a hint of corn on this one. This has been a unique SNPA in my experience. Immediately reminds me of cap'n crunch (weird). I recall this beer having a bit more bite, and a little more bitter on the back end.  M: Medium to heavy mouthfeel with medium carbonation. A bit slicking on the palate.  O: This has always been a fantastic and historic beer, dunno why, but this one is a little off.

S: Piney, floral hops with toasted malt.  T: Follows the nose to a tee. Taste has a floral/pine hops quality with the toasted malts balancing it out, but still pretty bitter as the hops win the war on this. I've been noticing a tea quality to hop forward pale ales lately and this has it.  M: For a pale ale, this has a thick quality to it. Bitter, dry finish.

Slight malty sweetness, which is quickly buried under a wave of hoppy goodness. Mixed in with the hops I can detect apples and citrus. The hops never quite hide the creaminess of the malt, but there's no contest as to who wins this battle.  Obviously, this beer is a classic. It is widely available and worth returning to every so often. Even though I worship the hop, I usually like my ``unimperial'' pale ales a bit more balanced than this one.

Lightly sweet lemon-tea-ish flavor up front, quickly followed by a bracing, assertive bitterness like citrus zest & pine. Full-flavored but not heavy, very refreshing.  Medium-light-bodied, a little resinous quality in the aftertaste, good, crisp finish.  Overall, great. Very drinkable, refreshing, flavorful, exactly what I want from a sessionable pale ale.

Overall-I can see myself 50 years from now still enjoying this beer. It goes great with food too. I do my grading to style and this is definitely one of the best, if not the best Pale Ale.

This is the taste that got me into IPA's back in the day. It basically introduced the hop as a beer's main character to me. Like I said for the aroma, I've had better since, but as for the taste, this is one of the most solid beers out there. Very perfectly balanced for a beer that is known for its hoppy character. For an introductory beer to the world of craft, there isn't a much better beer to have. Bitter when it needs to be, and just sweet enough on the backside to balance it out perfectly.

140,276,drinkofczars,4.07,"A- Very light copper color. One of the clearest Pale Ales I have ever seen. Great looking head on the pour, perfect amount.  S- Nice strong cascadian hop scent. Floral notes come through a lot on this brew.  T- I wish the hop flavor was a little more powerful. Perfect amount of citrus flavor. Though the scent had floral notes, i do not detect any in the taste of the beer.  M- Perfect. I wish more Pale Ales had this thinner type of feel. I find that IPA's and other Pale Ales seem too thick.  O- Perfect beer to start someone on who is not too fond of hops. The citrus flavor and the floral scents will please any type of preference.  Solid Beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,cocogan,3.94,"Visual: copper in color with orange hues. Just a lsight layer of various sized bubbles left as a head. a smudgen of lacing.  Nose: Orange peel, slight citrus, buttered biscuit, and eggs (not sure about style.. maybe scrambled).  Taste: Clementine and orange peel flavors up front, followed by pineapple citrus,bit of bready chewiness, tin metallic flavor, and a crisp earthen finish that is dosed with a balanced hop bitterness.  Mouth: feels like beer thats for sure, mildly carbonated, left fairly dry but yo mouth waters for more.  Drunkability: solid american pale ale. it is a good stand by because it is pretty easy to get ahold of nation wide. However, i endorse drinkin local beer, so i must say that this would taste even better if i were sippin it fresh in Chico, Cali.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Radome,3.8,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into a wide glass.  A - Beer is a deep golden color and very clear. The head is not overly big or long lasting, but is made up of tiny white bubbles.  S - The aroma is big and sharp. Green, citrusy, fresh hops. There is just a hint of bready malt in the background, but it is certainly secondary.  T - The taste is dominated by fresh hops emphasizing citrus and grapefruit. There is just a bit of nutty, grainy malt in the background. Not much complexity.  M - The bitterness is sharp but not mouth-puckering. A bit of carbonation fizz. Body is moderate, as fits the strong hops flavor. No alcohol noticeable.  D - The beer is very drinkable and enjoyable. It holds up well despite being such an early example of craft brewing. My only complaint is a lack of complexity with the hops so dominant.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,ColdPoncho,3.93,"Lots of numbers and things printed on the bottle. Don't know what they mean, but I would suspect this beer is about 4 months old, based on the store.  A - A hazy but clear amber body with touches of rose around the light. Small white head lingers a bit  S - Mild citrusy hops, light sweet malt. Small nose.  T - Bitter citrus hops are the thing here, but that's not overpowering. It's also got a nice simple malty backbone and its a good balance.  M - Medium-thin body, fairly smooth. Decent  O (D) - This is a good tasting beer that is not mind blowing in any way, but it's very good and very drinkable, and I find it to be rather sessionable. A great beer year round for sure.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,legalpete19340,4.48,"A: Poured a nice bright orangish gold with a thick two finger head that stuck to the glass and laced perfectly.  S: Piney hops push forward with citrus notes in the back, dry herbal scent with crispy pale malt. Smells like a dry forest.  T: Bitterness hits upfront with loads of pine and herbal spiciness. A solid pale malt backbone holds everything up and swings into the mid swig with a crispness and caramel sweetness then backs off again and lets the hops finish things up with a slap of bitterness.  M: Medium and surprisingly foamy/creamy with perfect carbonation.  O: Just a great beer IMO. Perfect example of the APA style. I keep coming back to this beer and am impressed by how enjoyable and interesting it is. Made better because I can find it anywhere.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,pmlondrigan,3.88,"I can't believe it has taken me this long to review this beer, I've only been drinking it forever. Decent pour honey amber with a white head that actually creates lacing, surprising as I usually drink this out of the bottle. Aroma is kinda hoppy I guess, more bitter and grassy and vegitile. The flavor is of pale malt, and grassy whole leaf hops, some herbacious taste and a mite of floral woody hops. Regular body, nothing special, overall it is sierra nevada pale ale.

140,276,Azurescens,3.65,"12 oz bottle with bottled on date 029121011, checked their website and code doesn't match with their formats for '09 or '11 so I assume this was bottled in late '10. Don't really see the point of bottling codes that change format every year, especially if you can't look up the formats for all previous years. Poured into Maudite stemmed glass, reviewed on 4/7/11  A: Pours a slightly hazed nice golden orange with dense fluffy head that I can already see sticking itself to the sides of my glass. Head hangs around for a while and leaves nice rings of lace around glass. So far so good.  S: Good combination of floral hops with some sweet malt aromas and a touch of alcohol and honey, nothing overpowering. Not too shabby.  T: A very noticeable crisp hop bitterness greets my taste buds up front that slowly fades to let the caramel malts and sweet hop resins come through briefly at the finish. Pretty standard taste for a pale ale, nothing special.  M: Plenty of carbonation and a medium-light body, slightly sharp up front with a smoother finish.  O: Pretty standard pale ale, the carbonation and hop bitterness that first greet your mouth hide the nice malt and hop flavors that come through towards the end of each sip. Decent pale ale, won't be grabbing six packs of this any time soon, but wouldn't turn one down either, especially on a hot summer day.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,veinless,4.13,"Pours a crystal clear pale amber, with a good color that isn't too deep but also not too light. Head is ample, frothy, and leaves generous lace.  Some nice grapefruit citrus hits the nose along with a good deal of grainy malt beneath. Citrus is definitely better than I remember, and the malt is acts to make a well balanced aroma.  Taste is a great combination of full malt flavor, including a toffee character before the grainy finish, and soft citrus. Malt is more prevalent here than in the nose, but the citrus does just enough to keep everything a good strength and balanced. Finish is slightly bitter and dry - good stuff.  Mouthfeel is fuller than a lot of other pale ales and the finish is a good dry as mentioned earlier. Carbonation is at the right level as well. Drinkability is phenomenal, as the flavors aren't too strong, but aren't pushovers either, and the finish is easy and dry. Readily available and really good is an awesome combination.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Smell: Strong citrus hop scent with pine and a hint of malt.  Taste: Starts with floral and pine hops followed by a hint of grapefruit and breadiness. Overall not very bitter.  Mouthfeel: Medium body and carbonation. Very crisp.  Overall: A very tasty ale with a very good balance between sweetness and bitterness.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

There's some sweet maltiness here, too, as well as some citrus. A nice clean smell.  T: Pretty hop-heavy with plenty of fruity sweetness. Not a terribly complex flavor but that's not the point here. Very crisp and refreshing.  M: Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Easy to drink.  O: A great pale ale.

Smell - Hops, hops and more hops with faint malts.  Taste - Straight sweet fruity hops with malts in the back (more of an after thought). Clean finish not dry at all.  Mouthfeel - Crisp clean and smooth, no dryness here. Medium body with almost zero carbonation.  Overall - Very hoppy pale but as a hophead I like it. I give this a thumbs up go grab one for yourself and give it a go.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Kylito87,3.8,This has always been my go to beer when the wallet is tight. I can't believe I have never actually sat down to review it.  Appearance- Hazy amberish gold. Offwhite cap of head. spotty lacing.  Smell- Citrus hop kick with some earthy grass and pine resin notes. Some sweet malt in the background.  Taste- Nice clean hop kick at first and a dry bready malt. Not overly complex but that is part of the charm of this beer.  Mouthfeel- Medium body with moderate carbonation.  Overall- This is one of my all time go to beers. Is it mind blowing no but is it delicious absolutly. It is a good beer at a good price.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

The taste begins with light breadiness, a hint of sweetness but gently dominated by the floral and piney hops. Lesser amounts of grapefruit bitterness with a hint of complex, ripe fruit left over in the finish. A pleasant bitterness and not too dry. Full almost chewy.  The mouthfeel is medium with average carbonation. Slight stickiness on the lips. Overall it's good but not what I would consider the be all and end all for APAs.

This beer is always seems fresh with a great mouthfeel and a bold taste. If you are someone that like sweeter beers, this may not be the one for you. If you are looking to try a good pale ale to get introduced to the style, then this is a great place to start. You'll be hooked.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,LazyL,3.83,Pours an appealing amber/orange with a fluffy white head. Not alot of hop on the nose but a nice malty ale with a slightly bitter finish. The bitter level on the mouthfeel is good and makes this beer. The hops were used as a bittering agent here and I dont offer much on the nose or taste. Good balance between sweetness and bitterness making this a nice beer for the style and good for a couple cold ones.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,jaycount,3.54,"I figured it's about time I reviewed this classic.  A - Light golden in color, looks like most pale ales... delicious!  S - Citrusy hops, only a slight bit of maltiness.  T - Alot of hops, especially sharp at the end of the swallow. I'm not sure if I drink mild IPAs or if this is a hoppy PA but this guy has quite a bit going for it.  M - Light, carbonated, refreshing.  This is a great drink for a hot, sunny Summer day.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,yeahnatenelson,3.73,"I had to get to this one eventually...  Appearance - Pours a gently hazed amber hue with an orange heart and a stuff sudsy white head. Silly string-like lacing.  Smell - Pine resin, dry grasses, faint floral hops, and bready malt. Smells very dry with hop aromas that bring about thoughts of foliage and meadows. If I had to describe the nose in one word, it would have to be clean.  Taste -- While not as bracingly hop forward as many other APA's that have followed the trail blazed by SNPA, the hop character is still very much in the forefront. Deeply resinous with hints of prairie grasses and Spring flowers. Malting is dry and bready with the faintest shadow of honey sweetness.  Mouthfeel -- Medium-light in body with medium carbonation - lively, but not harsh on the tongue. Immensely drinkable.  Overall -- While not my start, this beer was the beer that launched a thousand beer nerds, probably in the hundreds of thousands by now. Crisp, clean, and very much an antithesis to other fizzy, yellowish water that, for most craft lovers, came before SNPA. Not my favorite APA, but after having so many in the style Sierra Nevada still holds its own after so many years.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,Guden,4.05,"A- Medium gold in color, with a lively inch tall head.  S- Light malty sweetness and refreshing citrusy hops  T- The hops are there but the flavor is more complex than the nose with a little pine, lots of citrus, some juicy fruit and apricot flavors too just to perfectly round it out. Low in bitterness for the style, making the flavors seem even more juicy and fruity but enough to balance out any sweetness and make the hops the star.  M- Light and easy drinking. Medium carbonation and low in body.  D- Extremely easy to drink, nothing too strong but enough going on to bring me back for a few more. Nicely complex without overpowering.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,RonnieBear,3.51,"Picked this up at the liquor store due to its reputation. I've tried around 25 craft beers now, and this seemed like one I had to at least try before I went too much further down the rabbit hole. Really like the label design and color scheme for some reason. Just looks like it's going to be good.  Pours with a nice foamy head. Amber color, can see right through it. Can't really smell much of it at all.  Tastes like a good, basic, beer, which is what I was expecting. Figured it would be a decent, unoffensive crowd pleaser, but girlfriend and roommate both really did not like it, and they are fairly into craft brewing as well. Kinda weird. I thought it went down easy, and I drank mine quite fast.  Overall, much more refreshing than I was expecting. This beer seems like it would be best outside on a hot day or after a long day of work.

Coming back to you now for the first time in a long time (and one of the few times in a glass), I do believe you still have a piece of my heart. Beauteous is your gel amber glow. You'll give me head whenever I please with a swirl. A scent of dainty, delicately perfumy flowers, orange spice, and rich, clean cereal malt. Your hops, tenaciously citrus, bitter and prickly on my tongue. Round, smooth malts boasting fine crystal presence flowing fairly full-bodied, clean and deceptively spritzy-dry.

S: sweet citrus, green tea. big toasted sourdough notes as the beer warms a little.  T: bitter orange peel. definitely a solid american hop varietal detected. chalky, breadiness imparted partly by the yeast present in this bottle conditioned product and partly by the bready specialty malts used. some sweetness/toast present from this specialty malts as well.  M: pretty moderate carbonation on a medium body. finish is moderately dry, but has a bitter residual as well.  D: a very common, very well made APA. i would imagine just about every user on this site has had this one at one point. not my all time favorite APA, but definitely an american classic.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Smell: Not overpowering in the least, albeit slightly metallic.  Taste: Ahh, as good a pale ale as you will ever taste. Slight piney hop profile with a full body. I think I actually prefer the taste straight out of the bottle - habit maybe?  Mouthfeel: Full mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation. Smooth operator.

The same goes for this - you may be in an unfamiliar place in Florida (I am) but you can go into a gas station and buy this (I did). There wasn't much other good beer to buy.

A bit of toast, caramel, and bread from the malt shows through as well.  Flavor-Nice balance of malt and hops-neither steals the spotlight, but they both work in harmony. Some toast and bread notes from the malt, and fresh, green, woodsy, and slightly piney flavors from the hops. Moderately bitter finish is complemented by a slight mineral tang, making for a crisp finish.  Mouthfeel-Medium body, with moderate carbonation. Crisp and very refreshing.

As an Englishman, my compatriots tend to be critical of American brews, usually along the lines of ""too cold, too fizzy, too strong"".  Crisp flavor and fresh smell work well with the carbonation and lower serving temperature. Sure, it's a little stronger than your typical english ale, but I keep coming back to this beer, Summer or Winter, whether I am in the mood for a refresher or a warmer, SNPA always works!!!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,Tucquan,4.17,"Had this on 2011-03-04, on 2017-11-19 in Columbia, PA (and many times in-between). In 2011, my rating was 4.03 and here in 2017, I've raised the overall to 4.17. I've had many, many beers since my original review. I'm glad to say, this is still one of the best American Pale Ales. I left my comments below from 2011 unchanged since I enjoy seeing my earlier impressions.  A - Almost clear, straw-orange with a 1-finger head and good lacing.  S - Light grain, bready, orange citrus, pine and hop floral.  T - Sweet, lightly toasted malt, tropical fruit, pine, mild yeast. Some bitterness but not as much as an IPA. Good balance between sweet and bitter. Finishes on the dry side with bitterness just beating out sweetness in the end.  M - Light-medium body, medium-high carbonation. Crisp.  D - Really good. Refreshing and full of flavor.  Notes: This was my gateway into craft beer 2.5 decades ago. I haven't had it in a long time and not since I started reviewing beers on BA. I must say, after a whole lot of reviews and corresponding beer education on my part, this is a very delicious and highly drinkable brew. It is SO different tasting than I remember it being way-back-when. Now, I get tropical and citrus fruits to compliment the moderate bitterness. Back-then, it was the bitterest beer I'd ever had. It really holds up well!  Notes: On 2011-06-17 I had this side-by-side with an Orval. It was fun to compare and contrast these two fine beers. For a day-to-day brew, I'd prefer the SNPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,PeprSprYoFace,4.28,One of those beers you never think to review.  Pours a golden clear. Very nice white lacing and head.  Little bit of hoppy aroma with a nice malt backbone. Not super aromatic.  Taste is classic. This is the pale ale everyone bases their pales around. Solid good taste. A bit hoppy with a nice maltiness.  Mouthfeel is great. Smooth and crisp.  Overall this is mine and most people who like good beers go to beer when we can't find anything else at a bar. You can almost guarantee they will have SNPA. Even when their are other beers I'll get this one. It's also the beer you can buy a case of year round and relax to at home after a hard day at work.

140,276,ehammond1,4.1,"Bottle (2011)  El Mercado Market San Marcos, CA  A golden amber with floating specks of yeast particles dizzying their way around the brew. A white head forms initially but does not stay for long. Some specks of lacing dot the glass.  A combination of hop aromas in the nose; there's a majority of pine with some citrus. Not overly sweet or fruity.  A balanced and compete flavor profile. There's a fine combination of piney hops with some slight initial bitterness and then plenty of bready malts.  Perfect ""Sierra-Nevada-mouthfeel,"" which in my mind could be added to the beer lexicon. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation. The mouthfeel simply sings ""Purest Ingredients"" and ""Finest Quality.""  Incredibly drinkable. While this beer doesn't do any one thing significantly better than any other beer, it's an extraordinarily well balanced and delicious pale ale.  I also owe a lot to Sierra Nevada and this beer in particular to introducing me to the world of high quality craft beer. As a student in Chico, I was introduced to this beer very early and it became my most loyal study partner shortly after.

140,276,afksports,4.03,"Sierra Nevada helped make craft beer what it is with their excellent production of this Pale Ale. Their flagjip brew. And the A- rating it has on BeerAdvocate is well-deserved. Had on tap when it wasn't the most fresh, I'm still enjoying it, an still remembering the time when it was fresh an I enjouued it more.  Copper, decent head, resin pine smell of hops paired withal biscuity malt. SN PA has a hoppy aroma for an APA. Andt it's pleasant. The taste is hops first, paired with water thorughout and biscuit toast in the middle, a touch of caramel, hops bitter, and water in the back end.

S- When you smell this beer you defiantly get hops and a little bit of malt. Im expecting a hoppy easy drinker right here. Refreshing, slightly citrus smell.  T- The taste is amazing. Its not to overpowering while at the same time showing off the fresh hops, malt and slight citrus. After drinking more of it i feel its a lemon taste im feeling.It tingles my tongue d the with the hops, and then balances very nicely with the citrus tangyness. There is a pine taste in the background that is very pleasant and not overpowering. Very nice!  M- The mouth feel is very good. the taste impacts you but doesn't overpower you enough to only drink one. Lingers for a little but is not off putting, and leaves only after a little bit, making you want more and more.  D- Overall this beer is fantastic, SN is a great company doing great stuff with beer.

The hops give the beer some of the usual ipa flavors but the great malt backbone is the star of this beer for me  Light in body and very crisp, the medium carbonation helps out in the mouth feel.

I don't think I've ever tried it on draught, and I gotta say...wow. This is a whole different beast. It's smooth, delicious and everything I'd expect from a world class pale ale. Wow. No comparison. I'll definitely be buying kegs of this stuff from now on, possibly as a regular rotation.  A: Absolutely crisp copper color with perfect clarity. Generous off white FLUFFY head, with the most decorative lacing I've seen in awhile. Beautiful.  S: Has that distinct Sierra Nevada earthy yeast aroma. Cascade hops mixed with an earthy mild citrus.  T: Mild bitterness from the perle and magnum, but leveled out nicely with some cascade in the finish, perfectly balanced malt bill. This isn't in your face like some pale ales that border on IPAs, it packs enough floral and mild earthy citrus flavor to quench your thirst and leave you wanting more.  M: Perfectly carbonated, great balanced mouthfeel all around, goes down really smooth...too smooth almost.  D: I'm not sure you can get much more drinkable than this.

140,276,Spider889,3.82,"The benchmark with which all pales ought to be graded, this is a solid beer, and excellent at times. One of my gateways into hoppy beer, and certainly well worth the cost.  Lots of visible carbonation from my pour (bought this sixer at a gas station with my brother while out of town, gotta love seeing this no matter where you are). Very clear, a clean-looking bronzen beer. A tall frothy head is expected, and this beer easily delivers. The head is a white merangue - very resistant to my attempts to break through to the resinous nectar beneath. I am left looking a thick gooey lace after each sip. The appearance literally cannot be improved for this beer/style.  The smell seemed lacking, note to self: I need to tick this brew fresh off the tap. I got fresh wet hop leaves which create an earthy pine aroma. I have also always perceived a faint ""lagery"" smell from this beer, I assume that's just my brain associating like malt profiles with each other.  As for the flavor, there is an immediate perception of fresh winter pine needles. The hops are bitter and sticky.  The mouthfeel is quite resinous, and I'd pin SN Pale on the heaviest side of medium bodied. Crisp and refreshing nonetheless. Dry finish. The bitterness lingers and treads water very near that of many lesser IPA's. But then again, that's what SN is all about.  Always a solid beer. However many more interesting beers are out there for the finding.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

It's hard for me to believe now, but the first time I tried it I thought it was too strong. the best thing about it is the price.

Appearance: Pale golden color.  Smell: Hoppy  Taste: Slightly bitter and hoppy, but wonderful. Also, citrusy.  Mouthfeel: Light with crisp carbonation. Refreshing.

140,276,Seanibus,4,"The granddaddy of craft beers, my first what-is-this beer moment when I had some in the late 80s. It is no longer a pioneer or a wow by craft beer standards, but it has held up remarkably well as a mild, versatile, enjoyable pale ale. Pours a sunny reddish gold with a slight, quick-falling head and lively carbonation from the bottom. The aroma is pleasantly malty, with a little bread and caramel and a whiff of citrusy hops. The flavor seems almost quaint in this day of punishing citrus hops, but it is clean, crisp, slightly malty with a restrained dose of citrus hops and a mellow bitterness on the finish, with a hint of lemon. The mouthfeel is clean and a little prickly.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Pours a golden yellow/orange with a large 3 finger head. Lacing is ok, but honestly this looks like almost any beer similar to this. No really stong smells but what is there is a bready malt with a little bit of pine. The taste is more bready malt at first, but after a while it just overbears your taste buds and it becomes a very bland malt beer. The mouthfeel is too prickly for more liking, and really brings down the drinkability after a while. It is ok for what it is, but not a great craft beer in my opinion.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,diabecktic,4.1,"Appearance: I couldn't pour all of the 24 oz. bottle into my 16 oz. glass at one time, but each pour left me with ~3 fingers of creamy white head. Though lacing was simply ""good,"" the retention was excellent. The beer itself is a honey/orange color with a little bit of haziness.  Smell: The nose is anchored by a sweet, bready barley malt. Notes of hops, citrus, and caramel lend a sweet, piney character that provides an excellent compliment.  Taste: This beer's flavor, for the most part, resembles the nose. The citrusy, piney hop notes accent a bready, caramelly base. The balance is excellent, as both bitter and sweet notes become apparent at once. A slight spiciness ties all of the notes together.  Mouthfeel: The beer is fairly thick for my taste. The sweetness is likely responsible for the thick, sugary body, with bitterness largely present in the aftertaste. Both characteristics linger, though, so things are largely kept balanced.  Drinkability: Though a bit on the thick side, the alcohol remains well-hidden. Hence, this beer definately warrants sipping over time.  Summary: I find this beer to be close to an IPA. It's fairly hoppy, but also rather sweet and buttery (more apparent as the beer warms). I suppose that interpretation of this is subject to the taster's palate, but this is still a very good beer. I'll close with what others before me have stated - it's a very good APA.

The head is bone white and soapy, but lasts mere moments before fading away. Left behind is some sparse soap-scum lacing, which is quite appealing to the eyes.  Nose is a bouquet of delicate floral hops, rich malts and citrus.  Bready malts and fresh hops intrinsically work together in this beer. A great example of an American pale ale.  SNPA is medium body and oh so easy to drink. It is smooth and creamy on the palate with an abv slightly too high to justify it as a session beer.

First pour of a 24 oz. bottle is crystal clear very light copper color with a white 2cm head and fabulous lacing.  Smell kind of falls flat on the nose.. I'm hardly detecting anything. It's only with a monstrous inhale that I detect a hint of grassy hops. Bummer.  Taste is where this beer really shines. Smooth bittering hops pave the way for a grassy hop flavor all balanced out by a nice malt backbone.  Mouthfeel is nice and fairly light like a proper pale ale should be. Little viscous and leaves behind a trace of hops.  I'm afraid I may have done irreversible damage to my taste buds by a constant thrashing of west coast IPAs, so I must admit this won't be a regular in my rotation. It lacks what I personally look for in a beer which is a lot of flavor, every time I take a drink. The first few sips were good, and then it started to get a little bland on me.

Appearance 5/5 Quite clear for a bottle conditioned ale, SNPA pours deep amber with a big off white crown with good retention and excellent lacing. A truly good looking and inviting beer.  Aroma 4/5 Perhaps the beer is too old, although I picked it from the fridge at a beer store of repute, but I do not get much hops in the aroma. However, there is a very delicate and delicious bready malt character, and some floral/perfumy esters.  Taste 4/5 Slightly sweet with a nice hop bite that is bitter but not big on any specific hop character. A good body to support the relatively light bitterness. As far as I am concerned this beer doesn't stand out in terms of being ""big"" or complex but is a nice drinking beer that one can have a few of without tiring the palate or straining the liver all that much, and is the defining beer for its style.

140,276,valdesd1,3.64,"A: Pours a clear off gold to amber hue. Obvious little bubbles of carbonation. Didn't pour too aggressively to get a nice white one finger head that dissipated pretty quickly. Good amount of lacing.  S: Nice floral smell. Can't quite get too much out of it though.  T: Nice bitterness up front. Sweet citrus coming through the middle. Not too much bitterness coming off the end, leaving it to be smooth but not lacking in hoppiness. Definitely taste the sweetness from the malts towards the end. Compliments it well.  M: Nicely carbonated.  D: Considering the 5.6% abv, the ""not so in your face"" bitterness and smoothness, I'd say this is a sessionable beer.  Overall I like this beer. I'd say if you're looking for a standard pale ale, or beer in general, this would be a go to. For me however, I feel like it's lacking in complexity. Maybe i'm just used to other styles.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, pine, and pine hops. The flavor was of sweet malt, pine, pine hops, and nutmeg on the followthrough. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall as I said before, this was my gateway drug. My palate is a lot different now than it was. This brew wasn't overly great, but I can see why I started out drinking this. The flavor on this one was quite nice, it is just that the nutmeg I got on the followthrough is in no-way-shape-or-form one of my favorites.

A hint of floral and sweet scents are present as well.  T - The first sip is like a sucker punch of sharp, bitter hoppy glory. Lots of citrusy and floral hop flavor. There is a bit of caramel malty sweetness. Some hints of biscuit and earthy flavors as well. The flavor tends to sweeten and mellow as you drink.  M - Light body with moderate carbonation.

140,276,bamadog,4.08,"This is one of those beers that you've had about a million times but never sat down and took notes on. Well, I've sat down to take some notes. Review is from notes taken on 2/3/2011 and poured from the bottle to a pint glass.  Appearance: Pour is a light orange/coppery color and it starts with a nice 2 finger head with decent retention; head slowly fades to a full and uneven cap with a thicker island floating in the center; body has really good clarity and shows moderately strong carbonation; a few spots and swaths of lacing are left behind.  Smell: Smell is light, and could be a little stronger and more robust, but there is some citric hoppy zest and a definite toasty graininess and a slightly sweet maltiness hides out beneath.  Taste: Spot on and quite tasty -- definite lemony citric hops that are followed and well complimented by the toasty graininess; following that the sweet malts that lie beneath sneak in and with the hops, creates a bit of a faint floral flavor that lasts for a few brief seconds before returning to the hops; nothing overwhelming here, pretty straightforward -- always a great beer to go to in the summer, and it's ready availability makes it a great go-to when you're in a place that's lacking in craft.  Mouthfeel: Body is pretty light overall and the carbonation is crisp and prickly and provides quite a bit of liveliness; there is a moderately thick stickiness hanging out on the roof of the mouth that stays pretty moist throughout the drink.  Drinkability: This is really one of those all-day everyday kind of beers with the nice flavors that don't wreck your palate and a pretty doable ABV that clocks in below 6%.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

I noted that the glass was very cold (some ice on the rim) so some of the review may be tainted by this, but I let it warm up a bit before drinking.  Appearance: Clear orange-copper beer with a off-white head. The foam was practically non-existent when it came to the table, but after sipping a bit and giving it a swirl, some of it came back. Some lacing noted the whole way down the glass, but not a lot.  Smell: Very clean and floral scent with a hint of sweetness. At first I thought it was a bit perfume like, but it grew on me as it warmed up.  Taste: Clear citrus hops blended very nicely a good malt backbone. The malt flavor ranged between biscuity and caramel, probably which alternated due the meal I was having. A pleasantly tasty beer.  Mouthfeel: Some carbonation on the tongue with a thicker than water mouthfeel. Some lingering sensation on the teeth coming from the hops.  Drinkability: Despite the poor appearance, which I chalk up to the serving glass and not the beer, this beer is an all-around good one. Went very well with the meal (Angus burger sliders and garlic green beans and I could see this going very well with many others.

Aroma has the cascade hops up front bringing out that nice floral undertone. There also seems to be a little orange present in this also. The flavor is what I would consider to be probably the true American Pale Ale. The malts are present up front along with their counterpart, hops. Nice and refreshing. Following behind these two ingredients would have to be that orange I smelled earlier. There is also a little pepper and floral in the back end. Leaves a bitter and refreshing taste in the end. Good classic beer again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,Chadpaq,4.1,"Ahh, the beer that started it all for me. Figured it was time for a review. Poured from a bomber into a...um...solo cup. Nothing's clean! I'm sorry, Sierra Nevada, I know this hardly does you justice. But I'm confident you'll be just as delicious in plastic as you are in glass.  Huge, billowing head that's hardly receded in three minutes. Is this a product of the solo cup, or a too-ambitious pour on my part? I somewhat like it. It's very serene, and makes the beer's surface appear cloud-like. The beer heavens, as it were. Salvation in a solo cup. Unfortunately, I can't see through said clouds to make an assessment on appearance, and the impermeable walls of the cup allow zero insight to the matter either. Ahh, I've finally caught a glimpse as a ray of artificial, 60-watt sunshine makes its way through the cloud cover: Golden honey comb with a touch of lemon zest. Very pretty beer, something I'd expect from the staple American Pale Ale.  I used to think this beer smelled ""piney,"" and I still do. However, I've come to regard it as a positive connotation, something that wasn't always the case. It has a very natural, pure aroma.  I need two words to describe this beer, and two words only: Drinkable Satisfaction. Often, a tasty brew isn't as drinkable as one would like because it's so darn heavy. On the opposite end of the spectrum, a beer may go down as easily as water...but it may taste like just that. This beer falls neatly in the spectrum of...well, Drinkable Satisfaction. It's damn tasty. Bitter, fresh hops with a fair amount of grain and a bounty of other fresh ingredients. But, the body isn't huge, nor is the alcohol content, so it's very sessionable.  I've always felt that this beer had a good amount of carbonation, but not too much, allowing one to truly appreciate the copious amount of hops present within it, as well as the yeast and barley. It feels quite fine on the palate.  Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. The beer that started it all for me, craft-wise. I feel like there should be a sixth rating category for this beer: Nostalgia. If I could, I'd certainly give it a 5 here.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

The color is a translucent amber that looks nice under light as the carbonation rises to the head.  Aromas smell of citrus, grain, and hops with a fair amount of yeast. Those same aromas are present on the tongue as well as the carbonation which presents a cool fizzing sensation on the taste buds.  Pale Ales are not my preference, but from an objective point of view, I can say this is one of the better pale ales. It is not overly hoppy or bitter as many others tend to be.

I have always enjoyed its pleasant taste and easy drinkability, but I guess I took it for granted because many are not as familiar.  I've drank this beer in every way imaginable, but best is out of a bottle into a pint glass.  A - Nice pale color to it, more orange than yellow. Always give a nice head.  S - Nice floral and citrus hop aroma. Doesn't smell bitter in the nose, just smells fresh.  T - Such a smooth, easy drinking beer. Some hints of pine, and some bitters, with a citrus hop finish. It has a taste that you will immediately enjoy, and it won't kick you in the mouth. However, the taste doesn't go away. It stays with you the whole time, very flavorful.  M - Easy in the mouth, doesn't taste watery or too bitter, has just the right amount of body to sip it slow or drink it very very fast.  D - It's everywhere for me, and it always pleases. It is so smooth yet flavorful, I can have one and be happy, or down a sixer and not fall flat on my face. Just a superb session drink, one of the best pales to drink a lot of.

Taste: First taste is fruity, a bit like a soft drink. Biterness then takes over and becomes almost too much.  Mouthfeel: Dry, sharp bitter aftertaste like lemon rind. Carbonation feels like very small bubbles, akin to pop.  Drinkability: Too bitter for me, not balanced.

I guess I can call this beer my ""gateway"" craft beer. It opened my eyes to how good beer could really be. So after getting a kegerator, and finding out the local distributor carries an awesome variety of sixtels, I had to christen my kegerator with SNPA.  Pours a crystal clear deep yellow with a hint of orange. Big foamy white head that takes until the last few mouthfuls to disappear. Lots of sticky lacings.

Smell is a mellow, well-balanced citrus hop scent with a tad bit of yeast and sweet malt. Taste is just as well balanced with a nice balancing of the hops and malts. This beer is definitely my go-to beer at restaurants, simply because every place has it. One tasty brew!

Nose is attractive and definitely taunts the taste. Great fresh character with good balance.  T/M: Very smooth mouth feel. Crisp and refreshing. Lots of hops in terms of flavors, but not real drying or bitter. Some good balance here with decent notes of malts in the background. Really cleans the palate with the carbonation!

It has a citrus after taste to it. the mouthfeel is a nice creamy smooth medium bodied beer with a nice crisp clean finish. This crisp clean finish also makes the beer a nice drinkable beer. I'm not a huge fan of the taste of this beer, but it does have a nice hoppy finish to it and it is worth trying for those that like this style of beer.

Crystal clear and a light tan/straw color.  Smell is mostly of malts and yeast; almost lager-esque. Slightly bready, largely nondescript.  Taste is fairly even-keeled: non-too hoppy, nor too malty. Flavors of caramel malt hit up-front with some light dryness in the cheeks. A little tinny in the mouth, but the finish is smooth with an aftertaste of freshly baked dough.  Mouthfeel is decent, but not astounding. You know its there, but overall it feels fairly macro.  Drinkability is fairly high. This beer tastes better than your average macrobrew, but it's not a knock-out punch.

(Do these guys make any beer that's not great-looking?)  Smells and tastes like the classic brew that it is. Loads of pine and grapefruit with a dry malt profile that threatens to run away and hide altogether before returning with some light sweetness mid-swallow.

140,276,TheHopMonster,3.85,"Sierra Nevada has some very respectable beers that they produce and their Pale Ale is probably their most famous.  The appearance is a darkish amber with 2 fingers of foam that surprisingly stayed around for a while. The retention was lacking though maybe it was the pint glass I was using.  I definitely noticed pine and citrus aromas most likely from cascade hops. I definitely enjoyed the overall aroma of this beer.  Taste was what I expected, but I thought it was lacking in the hop bitterness category. I'm definitely a hop head so pleasing my hop craving is kinda hard to do.

The beer is a crystal clear deep golden yellow. Nice bright yet subtle grapefruit aroma with a sweet malty backbone. A solid bitterness hits the palate right away with a blast of grapefruit and malt sweetness. The body is light and refreshing with solid carbonation.  In my book this is one of the classic American Craft beers. Simple enough to be enjoyed by the masses, yet creative enough to stay interesting.

S- Floral and citrus, orange peel, hops, sweet grasses, and pine.  T- Mellow bitter hops on the front. Hints of pine and honey with a sweet undertone.  M- The balance is what perfects this beer. Slightly on the hoppy side, but very well balanced out. Slightly thin, but nice crisp and refreshing with a small hops bite.  D- Very drinkable.

140,276,weizenbob,4,"12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass. A finger-tall head forms and settles leaving a decent amount of lacing. The color is a golden orange hue which is more translucent than transparent. Some carbonation remains present.  Smells of citrus rind. Maltiness is apparent also. Small amounts of floral hops peek through the aroma.  The taste hits initially with some hoppy bitterness, though not overbearingly so. There is a good balance between the hopiness and the maltiness. The malt itself is present without being heavy. A tinge of orange sweetness fades into a hoppy aftertaste. The flavors and their timing are akin to a leisurely rollercoaster ride with mild hoppy peaks and mellow malty lows.  Mouthfeel is well balanced also. The malt is thick enough to be felt in the mouth but this beer still maintains a light and refreshing side. The mild carbonation keeps things moving along nicely.  5.6% ABV make this a bit high to be sessionable but the whole package is so darned smooth that I'd be tempted to put these away one after another. Its relative low-cost and high-availability for a craft brew only sweetens the deal. It might be the most well-balanced brew I've had the pleasure of drinking.

It's copper color is filtered and clear with bubbles rising constantly into a lovely white, foamy head. The lace is pretty and lasts for a while.  Smells fruity with a classic West Coast flavor. The hops are excellent yet lack the bitterness some demand. There is a soft bitter finish but nothing over the top. I love bitter IPAs and DIPAs, but sometimes this is the perfect call. Probably the perfect beer to introduce macro drinkers to craft beer.  The mouthfeel is never thin or watery, but medium with great carbonation, very refreshing.

However, I was pleasantly surprised by this beer, I fully expected an extremely hoppy bitterness that wasn't really prodominant in this beer. Definitely one to get again. As far as individual aspect thoughts:  A: A nice clear amber body with swirling yeast and a nicee thick off white, creamy head, with a decent retention and amount of lacing. Darker than I expected.  S: I wasn't impressed with the smell. I expected at least a little aroma, but it was lacking heavily in that department. Most IPA's i can smell from top pop.. this APA however only had a sliggghttt hint of citrus and a slight malty hint. not much.  T: Very smooth, clean, lager type taste with a biscuity maltiness that i didn't expect at all. There were several hints of citrus notes and a woody floral taste, more-so pine esque hints. I was pleasantly surprised by the full yet lite flavor of this beer. Very warm clean finish.  M: A very smooth fluffy head and an even smoother body. It went down smooth and poured smooth. A beer that definitely belongs in the silkier side of the beer world.  D: I could definitely kill a sixer of this beer. I only had one, but a few additional bro's would've been nice to kick back on.

Taste - what a great tasting beer. Beer offers a clean start with hints of citrus and finishes strong with the pine and hops. Slight aftertaste, but not overly bitter.

Citrusy hop, a bit of esters, biscuit malt.  The taste is the very definition of this style. A firm balance of citrus and sweetness, greapefuit aftertaste.  Frighteningly drinkable. Goes down so easily you have to watch yourself.  This is just a tremendous American pale ale. The beer world has changed a lot since it was introduced back in the early '80s, and I suppose I can understand it if some people feel that SNPA has been surpassed by hoppier, more sensationalistic brews.

The beer is a nice clear amber color with a very minimal amount of haze.  Smell has a mild aromatic hoppyness, not a very complex aroma overall.  Taste provides a nice balance of a bitter hop taste with a citrus wash to follow.  Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, provides a good tingly feeling on the tongue.

It was nice to grab a bottle last night from my brother in law at a family party. The right taste to help people get into beer. One of the best Pales out there.  Mouth- Its up there with the better pales, even though people consider this one of the run of the mill beers for people to try.  Drink- Could have had more than 1 I tell you that.

It is hard to describe how natural but redefined it tastes. Bang for the buck is huge with this beer.  Easy to drink with a super smooth mouthfeel to it. I wish the aftertaste was a little less pronounced; The bitter overpowers the good taste of the beer as the flavor fades.  Overall a very solid, tasty beer, wish I had tried this beer sooner.

140,276,Groomsy,4.01,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a very nice orange/slightly golden color. Nice one-finger head that slowly disappears throughout consumption. Nice carbonation and bubbles float up to the top of the glass, very impressive lacing down the side of the glass.  Smell: A little hard to distinguish, but the first thing I noticed was the hops; a very elegant blend of a sort of citrusy type of smell along with a pine smell(?). A little bit of sweetness from the malts as well. There's a good balance in the smell, but it seems very hops-dominated.  Taste: Whoa. Good stuff here. Lots of good stuff. An abundance of citrus hops comes up front that sort of ""wake up"" your tongue followed by some slightly sweet malts in the middle to balance out the hops which just bombarded your tongue (in a good way). The beer goes down with a very nice bitterness and ""yeast"" taste that leaves a lingering aftertaste in the mouth. VERY impressive and refreshing. Kinda kicked my tail.  Mouthfeel: Moderately thin and light, but not watery; there's some substantial body to this beer that is a good balance between easy to drink and solid thickness. The carbonation also plays a role in this.  Drinkability: Depending on the setting, it would be really easy to knock back a few of these. Its great refreshing taste and solid body make it a very drinkable beer for any time of year.  For my first pale ale, I'm very impressed.

S: Hops, pine with a citrus smell, very little smell overall,but then again my nose is a little stoped up.  T: Citrus, very grapefruit to me, lemon/lime, not really too hoppy for a pale ale but is there, it does taste good and is very refreshing, makes me think of summer, a good beer to drink when riding the ol' lawn mower.

D: Very drinkable, i am not a ""Hop Head"" by any means and dont usualy drink PA/IPAs but i do enjoy this one its not over the top with hops and is very refreshing, love the grapefruit taste to it.

This beer is like the story of Goldilocks: not too much this, not too little of that, but just the right amount of everything.  M: well carbonated, dry and yet thirst quenching.  D: This has and always will be one of my favorite beers. It is both the quintessential American Pale Ale and Californian beer, as well as Sierra's best beer (obviously all my opinions). I love the simplicity of it, the straight forwardness, and that it has a similar taste to all the other Sierra beers, but is the one that really stands out among the rest.

Very good balance with the hops. It's slightly sweet and bready too, but I think the balance of the hops is what makes this beer taste so right. This pale ale definitely hits it's high notes. It knows it's job and delivers.  M - Carbonated, but very smooth. Places well in between 'too thick' and 'too light,' just a happy medium. Slightly chewy, but just enough to let a good aftertaste simmer on the taste buds.  D - Very good drinkability. It's light but very good for when you want to drink a few.

The malts do a great job at keeping them in line. Just a great tasting pale ale, no gimmicks.  Mouthfeel: Super smooth and feels really good.  Drinkability: Very drinkable, very good.

On the palate is fairly the same as on the aroma. Crisp refreshing starts up a little dryish but then the hops and malts are loose and they linger on until the aftertaste in which the malts subside and they get replaced by a hoopy fruity aftertatse.

Perhaps I had some yeast buildup from storing it sideways.  S- Slightly hoppy (considerably hoppy for a pale ale), with notes of grain and caramel.  T- Citrus and pine upfront. This brew balances hops and malt tremendously. After getting into craft beer I find this to have the level of flavor I want, but not much more. It doesn't disappoint, but doesn't impress too much at the same time.  M- Pretty creamy, but fairly thin. Carbonation was just right though.  D- Easy to drink, and good all around beer.

The wonderful hop aroma rises from the glass, with oranges shining through. The taste is just as magnificent as the beer looks and feels, with hops immediate on the tongue, with the citric fruit taste charging through, with a fruity aftertaste. A decently high amount of carbonation is apparent, with a medium body an a delicious hoppy finish. I'd have to say that all things considered, this is my favorite beer.

Smell- Decent amount of potent hops, slight flowery notes, tinge of biscuity malts.  Taste- Sharply hopped. Hops predominate the flavor, good warmth for the fairly average ABV level. Good malt undertones. This is the brew that put Chico, California on the map. Flagship of Sierra Nevada, and always a good choice for a well-concocted pale ale.  Mouthfeel- Crisp.

Sierra Nevada Pale Ale dominates.  - Pours excellent. Has an attractive bronze/gold color, and comes alive with bubbles as it hits the glass and stays alive unlike many other ales that lose carbonation quickly. - Has a unique smell that reminds me of cedar, and just calls out your name. - Plenty of hops to balance the carbonation to bitterness ratio. Has a ""foresty"" taste to it(for lack of a better word), and doesn't get old. It's hard to drink the other beers when Sierras are in the cooler. They always go first at the fights we host. - The mouthfeel is simply crisp, and satisfying - As for the drinkability like I said before they always go before all of the other beers. They're great all night. Not too filling, and you wont't be making trips to the bathroom each brew.  This beer is perfect.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Some lacing left behind, retention is quite nice.  Smells of bread, whiffs of alcohol, grain, and white grape. A bit of floral hops as well.  Tastes follows smell. I get bread, grain, white grape, and light bitter resin and floral hops.  The mouthfeel sports lively carbonation and medium bodied. Crisp and smooth. Just what I want from a pale ale. Very refreshing.  An insanely drinkable beer, and a staple in my regular line up. I get the impression that this is a slightly older bottle as there is usually more of a hop presence.

140,276,ColForbinBC,3.98,"On-tap, served in a pint glass  Pours a bright amber color with a two finger, sturdy cream colored cap. Small streams of bubbles and good retention. Head eventually recedes in a rain drop type of pattern to form a thin layer of foam. Aroma is of grapefruit, peaches and apricots with a sturdy caramel malt backbone. The flavor is almost identical to the aroma. Grapefruit up front with soft peach and apricot as the caramel malt comes through in the middle before a moderately bitter finish. Medium body with a creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation is spot on. This is highly drinkable. A nice balance with just the right amount of hops winning out to not overly assault the palate.

Smells of citrus and pine hops, very crisp and fresh smelling. Taste is great, starts with citrus and pine hops followed by understated sweet malts. I know its bitter, but it doesn't taste that bitter, quite refreshing. Mouthfeel is perfect, carbonation is just right too.

140,276,pb9613,4.97,This beer poured a color that is not amber but not golden. The color is in a league of its own. The beautiful with head that appeared on top was solid white which lasted throughout the entire drinking experience.  The beer smells of that wonderful cascade hops with a rich citrus nose.  The taste is divine. This is what pale ale should taste light. Wonderful malty flavor with a rich hops taste. The bitterness of the hops is left as an undertone to the overall flavor with the flavor hops coming to the forefront.  This beer fills the entire palate of flavors with a heavy malt flavor for body and the hops for aroma and flavor.  This is a beer you can sip all night and not realize how many you drank until you wake up with the hang over.  Overall one of the best beers on the market and the reason Sierra Nevada has been around 30 years.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,Kestrel452,2.2,"If you're relatively new to beer, I would highly recommend you steer clear of this brew. You will most likely find it way too bitter to drink, and maybe even so much so that you cannot even take another sip. Before you venture out into the realm that is known as pale ales, try some more balanced/milder beers like Honker's Ale before going for this. The beer was great except for the flavor, it was just sickeningly bitter.  I realize this is widely regarded as an excellent beer, but it is NOT something a beginner should drink. Pale ales are inherently pretty bitter, but this one is extra hoppy/bitter. You'll end up turning yourself off to pale ales and possibly ales in general by making this your first go at an ale.  If you want to get used to beer that employs a good amount of hops, drink Sam Adams Boston Lager. It's well balanced, but it also does have a substantial enough hop character to fit the bill. It's about as bitter of a beer that's enjoyable to me.  In time, you may develop a palate for extra bitter beers like SNPA. However, let me reiterate that this beer should be avoided when you're starting to try out different varieties of beer. Happy Drinking!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,StarshipPoopers,4.15,"A - This beer looks great. The head is an attractive creamy white with excellent lacing and good retention. The initial pour produced about 2 fingers of head and after 10 minutes or so there is still about half of a finger remaining. The beer itself is a bright copper colour.  S - Notes of citrus hops and slight grains.  T - Fantastic. The hops have a citrus flavour that has great pine notes. Slightly bitter but balanced well. Initially there are the citrus and hops, followed by the sweeter malts with grain and a very subdued biscuity taste.  M - I love the feel of this beer. The retention of the head is absolutely great and lasts throughout the glass. That combined with the slight bitterness of the hops and the hints of sweetness all come together to make a beer with a very nice mouth feel.  D - I'm scoring it high because this beer is fantastic from start to finish. The smoothness, appearance, and balance of the taste all make this very enjoyable to drink.

140,276,CBlack85,4.3,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  The beer pours a ever so slightly hazy copper/light amber color. An aggressive pour produces about three fingers worth of creamy white-ish head that slowly recedes leaving behind sheets of lacing that nearly cover the glass.  The aroma is of grassy piney hops, followed by the light scent of orange zest and lemons. The malt is moderately noticable, giving off a biscuity and grainy character.  Lots of citrusy hops, with the piney/grassy hops taking a backseat. Quite well balanced with the biscuity/bready malt backbone always being present but never outdoing the hops. Slightly sweet. The carbination give it a sharp quality on the tounge. Medium bodied and finishes relatively dry. Very drinkable  In many ways this was one of the beers that turned me on to craft beer, and I always seem to have some in my beer fridge. Just a terrific go to beer.

Mouthfeel: Light feel, but the carbonation makes it feel fuller without being too fizzy or gassy.  Drinkability: Superb drinkability, I could (and have) drink these all night.

Personally, this is what all IPA's are compared against.  T: Right down to the aftertaste this is 100% grapefruit citrus. Biscuit malt backbone but takes a backseat to the hop goodness. Mild aftertaste, but pleasant and unobtrusive.  M: Medium body and low carbonation. Smooth, bordering on oily. Decent, but not great.  D: Easy sessioning selection. Goes down easy, doesn't overpower the palate, and goes great with food. Can't ask for much more.  O: It all started here for me, and it will always have a soft spot in my heart.

However, they are not among the strongest I've tasted in this style of beer. They're at a pretty medium level of bitterness. Throughout the swallow, there's a creamy malt presence that sits under the hoppiness. The taste of this beer doesn't really change for me from initial taste to after the swallow. Citrus hops with an undercurrent of malt, and that's it.

S - Smell is of citrusy hops, with pine, and a caramel malt base to help balance things out. Classic American pale ale scents here!  T - Classic Sierra Nevada flavor here! (were you expecting something else?). That signature citrus/piney hop flavor is there on the forefront, but comes with a hint of caramel-ish, almost bready malts later on that keep things pretty well balanced. Perfect if you're looking for a basic, balanced ale leaning a bit more towards the hoppy side.  M - Medium body and mild carbonation throughout. Nothing over the top, and nothing offensive at all here.  D - A great pale ale to session! Whether it's just one, or a few of these, they hit the spot for sure!  Overall - A classic go-to American pale ale, often considered the archetype of APA's.

Aroma is a bit hit of malt with slightly citric, grassy, cat pee, and piney hops. Upon tasting, the entry is lightly malty then immediately followed by a grassy strong pine and slightly oily bitter astringency. Then a big dose of sweet malt and fresh baked bread comes through in the aftertaste. As it warms up, a stronger sweetness starts to reveal on the finish through the aftertaste which turns it almost too sweet.  Very nice balancing act between the hops and malt. Carbonation is light, enough to tickle the tongue, with mouthfeel being medium light bodied. Fairly crisp finish.  Drinkability is fairly high -- feel this is a pretty nicely balanced brew.

They are the brewery that set the benchmark on pale ales and here is your flagship. Similar characteristic to what I described in taste.  The mouthfeel is perfect.

This is a very good smelling brew that stings the nostrils slightly, a well balanced aroma with little to no astringency.  Taste: mild bitterness from beginning to end, but nothing offensive. You can taste the hops flowery taste, but the bitterness is about the only consistent taste. The taste is not overly complex, but still enough to keep your tongue working throughout each mouthful.  Mouthfeel: light bodied dry brew that leaves your mouth very clean. The carbonation is apparent, but it's not so heavy that you end up with puffy cheeks when rolling the brew on your tongue.

140,276,Zimbo,4.5,I've been drinking this for years and have always marvelled at how such a widely available beer can be so consistently tasty. But it is the mouthfeel and taste which really capture me. That citrus chewy oily hoppy quality once the beer hits the tongue never fails to activate even the most stubborn taste buds. Sure it isn't a 240 hour IPA but the balanced lingering bitterness and reasonable alcohol gives the brewer no where to hide faults. Just as well that I've never found any worth mentioning apart from the fact that it is hard to have just one. So easy to find and enjoy and so rewarding. The consensus is growing but I still don't think it gets the respect it deserves.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,BBMuffins,4.27,"This is a beer that I've gone back to again and again as a great, refreshing summer beer.  Appearance - It's a nice golden color with fizzy carbonation.  Smell - Smells almost exactly like it tastes, a nicely toned bitterness with some citrusy grapefruit and perhaps a bit of an apple or orange peel scent. I know those are two distinct smells, but it has a bit of both. Apples might just be me, though.  Taste - Taste is as described for smell, exactly like a nice, juicy grapefruit and some malty undertones. It's such a well balanced beer, the bitter and the malts blend perfectly to provide a nice solid beer, while not overwhelming to a standard non-IPA or DIPA craving palate.  Mouthfeel - A pretty dry, fizzy drink. One of the more crisply carbonated beers I've ever had. I love it. It's not overly carbonated, but it's dryness means the carbonation tingles and disappears at just the right time. Probably my favorite beer in this particular category.  Drinkability - This beer is an excellent example of an American Pale Ale, it's easy to drink, tastes great, feels great, and it's just a fantastic standard. I love this beer. When I go to the beer store to buy beer, and I can't make a decision, I always pick this. It does what I want in the right amounts.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,bohemiandonut,4.19,"To begin unconventionally, the first thing that sets me off about this brew is the mouthfeel. It's incredible. Easily one of the most carbonated beers available. Taste is a bitter orange honey. This is the Superman of Champagnes.  It's easy to miss this beer, but it's also easy to misbeer and under-score the nuances of any these biologique treats. Grassy, yeasty and hoppy, SNPA earns its green belt. You go way back with this beer and you know it.  Kind of a fighter, this baby. So drinkable yet so direct. A statement neither overdone nor cheap. God bless Sierra Nevada, perhaps the most solid brewery in all the world. Unstoppable, beautiful ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,imwalle,4.12,"Serving type: bottle poured into a tulip glass First kind of pale ale i have ever drank.  Appearance: Yellowish/orange with a white head, no lacing  Smell: very floral due to the amount of hops in it.  Taste: yet again you can taste the hops. there was another taste in there but i could not put my finger on it, it may have been a bit of pepper but couldn't really tell.  Mouthfeel: it has a great mouthfeel with a little bit of carbonation. the more i drank it the drier it felt. it was crisp also  Drinkability: a very drinkable beer.

Citrus fruit, bubblegum, sherbet notes. A slightly hoppy finish.  M. Medium bodied with some carbonation.  D. Quite a nice interpretation of a pale ale from the boys at Chico. A BIG improvement on their Porter I just had. Also, I appreciate this beer more than when I first tried it about 5 years ago. Like their Porter it is still lacking somewhat in the aroma/palate departments but would take this offering over the Porter.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,CajunCavern,4.3,"Bottle - Nice golden, slightly orange color with white head. Citrus, particularly grapefruit and orange peel aroma.

This beer goes great with crawfish and pizza.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,gopens44,4.15,"Revisited this beer, but previously I had only had it from a bottle, which was never a disappointment.  Poured from tap into a pint glass.  Great color, bold yet lighter yellow (does that make sense?). Nice head - thick at first,probably 2"" that held together well for about half of the beer, then settled to a thin layer. No lacing  Smelled great - not too hoppy, not absent of any scents, just a good mellow yet bold smelling beer (there's another contradiction, eh?)  Tasted better than I remembered. Not too strong, but you know that you are drinking a well crafted beer. A little hoppy, but smooth and crisp. Temperature may have been a little too cold, but the glass was sitting on the ice strip on the bar. Still not anything to bitch about. Probably served at the same temperature that you'd find if you pulled it from a cooler. So, I guess this would make an excellent tailgating beer. Not too heavy, great taste, and certainly a better idea than any macro that most coolers are invaded by!  I'd buy this baby over and over again as an everyday drinker, no doubt about it!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,89Vision,3.82,"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. This isn't what I usually drink, but I saw it in the grocery store and it made me thirsty, so I figured why not. I've had it before, though I didn't appreciate it then.  The appearance is a toasted golden color, with a very thin head. It has a bready pine scent that is pleasing, but subtle.  This beer is pretty damn tasty. While I'm not usually a fan of highly hopped beers, I enjoyed this one. It does have a fairly high bitterness, but its not unpleasant, and the hops give a nice pine, woody flavor, but doesn't become overpowering. I could see this beer being perfect for a camping or canoe trip.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,scobeer,4.13,"Golden amber colour is inviting with some really interesting citrus aromas. Very well balanced, the hops aren't overdone which makes it easily drinkable but still interesting enough to savour. Fair amount of carbonation gives a zesty feel.

140,276,VietPong,2.43,"I found this beer to be super bitter. I do like beers with a slight bitterness, but this definitely seemed overpowering.

Nose of earthy woods-y skunky deliciousness. Palate is crisp and bitter right off the bat. Woody hops, piney but not a lot of citrus. Some pink grapefruit or grapefruit zest anyway. Bitter bitter, bitter, but somehow insanely drinkable. Can drink this all night. I think it's because it's so clear.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Casey10,4.1,This has started to become my go to beer as I was drinking a lot of IPA's I wanted to back down a bit and got back into this one. I never reviewed so I thought as I might as well now.  This is truly a a great beer it is easy to obtain perfectly golden and crisp and is super consistent. Also because of afordability and the ability to find this in a lot of places makes this one in my mind a top notch brew.  Sure it's not a hard to find or hopped up monster but anyone looking into geeting into craft beer or just chilling having a nice regular craft brew can do no wrong here.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Clear amber body, multiple streams of carbonation. Pretty big hop presence in the nose, floral, a a bit of citrus and resin, significant hop bill balanced by caramel/crystal malts. Taste mirrors nose, this is certainly one of the more hoppy APAs you'll find, bordering the IPA category. Smooth clean mouthfeel with good effervescence, a hint of stickiness. Tres drinkable.

140,276,eclaycamp,4.4,"12 ounce bottle. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Maybe the one beer that got me into craft beer 10 years ago or so. Pours a light golden amber with a nice fizzy white head. Looks beautiful in the glass. Aroma is light citrus and grassy hops with some nice caramel malts in the background. First taste is both familiar yet arresting at the same time. Just a brilliant brew. There's this great oily and piney hop character in the body and in the finish that's played out perfectly by the sweetness in the malt body. Wonderful semi-sweet finish. I've been getting back into Pale Ales recently, and this beer is probably the perfect example of what I'm looking for in the style. I really like this beer a lot, and tasting it again for the first time I've fallen back in love with it all over again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

M - At once crisp and refreshing, goes down smooth and finishes dry.  D - I could drink these all day and all night.  Everything in this brew is fine-tuned to perfection.

I've been drinking this for a few years, so I figured now that is in the Top 100 list (context: minimum reviews was changed to 1000 in order to be considered a top 100 in the world beer), I felt it was time to review it!  This brew pours a coppery color with orange hues and an off-white head of three fingers that had respectable retention. Thick glaciers of lace cling in huge slow moving masses of micro bubbles.  Smells of a sweet malt-- like a Hawaiian bread and sweet caramel note. The hops come across as mostly citrus and floral. The nose translates well on the taste with a good upfront sweetness that gives way to a grapefruit and citrus hip note with a slightly spicy floral note towards the finish. The finish is clean and pleasant.  Nothing rough or uneven about this beer-- very well balanced and easy to drink. There is probably a reason that this is one of the biggest gateway beers into the world of craft-- it is a mighty fine beer.  The body is medium with decent carbonation.

140,276,newcastleme,3.55,This was an excellent ale. The only problem is that it may be too sweet of an ale.  Appearance was a pale standard ale.  The smell was moderately sweet.  Taste was the most appealing factor of this beer. It was strong with nice hints of fruit.  Mouthfeel was medium bodied and not to strong.  I would drink this beer again and feel it has incredible potential for food pairings.

T: Slight malty flavor followed by a super satisfying bitterness from the Magnum, Perle and Cascade hops is a delight. Piney hop goodness!  M: Natural conditioning provides just enough carbonation to give this brew a refreshing medium mouthfeel.  D: Perfect session ale. I can drink several and still want more.

Taste: Intensely complex flavor is initially quite shocking. The aroma suggests a fairly simple brew of yeast and citrus hops. However, the taste reveals an initial fruity, malty dependence that yields to a moderately bitter series of citrus hops that eventually give way to a dry, clean finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied beer that feels very clean in the mouth.

Nose is citrussy hops, bready malt, a touch of citrus and lemon.  A bitter, hop-dominated brew, with both citrus and earthy hops coming to the fore, but with a fine malty backing providing enough sweetness to make this highly drinkable. Notes of bread, caramel, grapefruit and lemon. Finishes bitter and tart.  Decent body, carbonation thoroughly covers the palate, allowing the hops to really pop.  A great example of the style.

Smell is of hops and yeast, with a slight undertone of citrus. Fragrant, but not overpowering. I was sort of expecting a similar bouquet to Troegs Nugget Nectar, but it just seems simpler and cleaner.  A big hoppy blast of bitterness starts it off, and never really goes away, even as the taste of the beer settles on the tongue. I caught some hints of citrus and some good malty presence, but the bitterness is always there and continues into the aftertaste. Not terrible, but definitely a little unbalanced in that department. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a good amount of carbonation that manages to retain a semblance of smoothness.  Drinkability is okay for me. Maybe I was spoiled by having Nugget Nectar first, but the bitterness was just a bit unbalanced, at least in my admittedly inexperienced opinion. It was by no means overpowering, just a little too... present in the taste without much else complexity.

The beer looks like a pale golden color, pours out with a lot of carbonation and effervescence. Nice thick head and clinging lace from the abundance of American hops. There is always some residual yeast in the bottom of the bottle from the bottle fermentation; I like this, and I try to swirl it into my glass. Smells like, well, hops and some biscuity maltiness, and despite the strong presence of hops I feel this beer is well balanced and very drinkable.

S- Nice mild bouquet with a hint of citrusy hops and yeast dominating its aroma.  T-The taste of hops is just a little out front but not overpowering (just where I like it in pale ale). The flavors lean away from sweetness toward dry, less malty, which again is a characteristic I highly favor in pale ale. A moderate citrus and pine flavor topped by a well pronounced hops clearly comes through on the back of the palate which complement its well-balanced flavors.  M-Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is a nicely carbonated beer that feels almost creamy to the mouth right to the end. Great on a warm summer day!!  D-This is a great alternative for fans of IPA's who are also looking to lower their alcohol intake, carbohydrates, and calories while holding onto some of the attributes that make IPA's such flavorful beers. It's becoming increasingly easy to find across the country which makes it a beer staple for those living in fringe areas with limited choice or traveling by vehicle.

Its a nice rustic gold, amber color.  i picked up alot of hops in the smell, there may have been a little hint of citrus in there too. i actually really liked the smell of this beer.  the taste is what throws me off. the hops sort of punch out in the beginning and theres an after taste of more hops with a little bit of fruitiness, to me at least.  like it may be because i am not a big fan of pale ale even though there is a few i enjoy.  for me this beer was bearable for about half a glass and after that i had to struggle to drink it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Always enjoyed.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Bravo4,4.35,"I poured this straight from the bottle into a German seidel.  A- It has a rich golden, amber color to it with a 1-finger white head that disipates quickly. It leaves a nice ring of head around the glass and slight lacing. The lacing annd head seems to have a gritty texture.  S- My sense of smell isn't all that good but it definately has some citrus scent to it with a slight floral hops aroma. I also detect a minute amout of pine.  T- Like the smell it has a citrus/pine flavor with a slight hops bitterness. The bitterness of the hops isn't too agressive but it isn't overly lacking either.  M- It has decent carbonation and a creamy but not heavy feel.  D- It's definately a very drinkable beer. It would be one of my choices for a session.

Nice malty, lightly caramel weetness balanced out with a fairly prominent floral/earthy flavor with light bittering finish. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy for a pale ale.  Highly drinkable pale ale with a great bottle conditioned carbonation. Good hop presence for a pale ale but not overdone.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,LacquerHead,3.93,"Poured this into a Sam Adams pint glass.  It pours a nice amber color with a very slight haze. The brew produces a white foamy head that never dissipated. (The foam clung to the sides of the glass very nicely.)  The hops was the first thing I detected along with a slight citrus along with grain.  The taste was very smooth and the bitterness of the hops was not overly aggressive. There was a slight citrus, but for me straw and grain came through the most. The overall flavor reminded me of autumn. This was easy to drink.  This is the beer I would recommend to anyone who wanted to try a pale ale for the first time. The hops is a little mild for my taste, however, the smoothness and quality keeps me going back. This is just a well put together beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,mash4077,4.67,"From a bottle into your standard 16oz glass.  A- Pours a dull copper/orange, with spots of gold in the light. Translucent with mild cloudiness. About a finger of head which disipates relatively quickly.  S- Hops are the most noticeable smell, right up front, with an orange scent coming out strongly as well.  T- Strong hops taste for the style, almost imediately, with less of an orange presence than expected considering the smell. Finishes off with playful maltiness and definite spicy flavors. Well balanced, all in all, but the hops do stand out on their own (in a great way). The malts are much more noticeable as it warms.  M- Definitely creamy, but not too heavy for the style. Well carbonated, but not overly fizzy. More ""relaxing"" than ""refreshing"".  D- Very drinkable, a midpoint between a session and an IPA.

140,276,irishking1977,3.5,"I've had this beer several times on draft, and it never really struck a chord with me. Friends that have tried it for the first time described it having a ""celery and ashtray"" taste to it. While I doubt they've ever chewed on a celery stalk and a cigarette butt at the same time, I can see what they mean, to a degree. Beer enthusiasts pretty much rave about this beer, so since I consider myself one as well, I thought I should give it an honest review:  A: Pours a translucent dull gold with a moderate head that doesn't stick around for long nor leave any signs of lacing. Decent and somewhat typical for a pale ale.  S: Floral hops aroma mixed in with some malt and citrus characteristics. Seems fairly balanced.  T: No sense of any celery stalks or cigarette butts, but I do get a sense of mild hops, with semi sweet malt and a slight bitter, citrus twang at the finish.  M: Good, solid carbonation; this is a relatively easy drinking beer. Slightly thicker and more robust than your average pale ale, but that's supposed to be a good thing.  D: A decent choice for a session beer; and a good choice for a keg during a summer cookout. I know I'll recommend this, to any casual beer drinker. Not something that amazes me by any means, but a solid pale ale, to be sure.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

The head sticks around for a good while and leaves some good lacing.  Smells strongly of hops, lots of citrus and floral scents. The hops definitely dominate the nose. The taste is very well balanced, starting with the hops, again lots of citrus and floral notes. It then moves to the malts, with a very nice sweetness. It finishes with a nice bitterness and citrusy aftertaste.  The mouthfeel is fairly thick, but not overly heavy. It is very smooth with a slightly below average amount of carbonation.

At first there wasn't a lingering residual taste in my mouth. After several sips this changed. It began to accumulate but even then the duration wasn't drawn out.  The head reduced to maybe 1/8th inch but would revive with each taste. But very little lacing.  I sampled this beer twice. The 1st solo. The 2nd with dinner. I think therefore I prefer it solo rather than with food. For my taste I prefer the beer to mesh in a wonderful way with a meal. In this case it was with grilled New York Strip, Baked Potato and corn on the cob. Perhaps it was this meal but the beer was just a beer. Nothing happened. The beer was the same as when taken solo.

140,276,jporf911,3.38,"Sierra Nevada consistently puts out a number of good beers, so I was excited to try this one out. It was recommended to me by an Indian friend (slightly ironic that he enjoys APAs more than IPAs, isn't it?).  Poured from a 24oz bottle into a traditional glass.  Appearance- Pours primarily yellow-orange with a fluffy white head that isn't as large as I expected, considering the heads on most pale ales; still, there are a lot of bubbles and a good deal of sticky lacing all over the glass, along with a thin sedimentary layer that probably resulted from the bottle-conditioning. There are even more bubbles in the second glass; in fact, I'd go so far as to say there's a veritable shitload of bubbles.  Smell- The nose is a bit floral and very citric, with a strong scent of bitter hops on the back end. There is also a slight undertone of grain, but the citrus overpowers it for the most part. Not bad.  Taste- Christ almighty, who shoved an entire orange into this bottle?! The most noticeable aspect of the taste is the almost overpowering acidity. It soon fades to a citrus sweetness with notes of orange peel and spice. Bitter hops linger on the back of the tongue long after swallowing. The second glass was not so acidic, so this beer may simply need a bit of time to breathe before being poured, or it could be a matter of your mouth and throat needing to adapt to the acidity.  Mouthfeel- This Pale Ale is thin but not watery, with a pleasant tingling sensation from the abundant carbonation and acidity.  Drinkability- This is supposedly a classic example of the American Pale Ale, but it's a tad too acidic compared to others I've had. It's good, but it's not something I would drink on a regular basis.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,charlesbyrd,4.03,"Poured from a 12 oz. stubby bottle into a pint glass.  A: Pours clean, clear, and honey amber in color. The head is soapy white and just present enough to leave a ring around the top of the beer for most of the session. A slight bit of lacing is noticeable.  S: It's a subtle competition between earthy aromas (leaves, grass) and bread, both being readily available to the nose but not overpowering the other.  T: A fair amount of tangy, citric hops clings to the palate. The initial bitterness makes way for a bready biscuit taste. The pairing of flavors is very interesting: the slight sweetness from the malt and fruitier hops fight to push through the almost metallic bitterness, but don't quite make it. The freshness of the components of this beer are very prevalent.  M: Light and crisp on the palate with medium to high carbonation. The beer clings the entirety of the mouth and has a refreshing, dry finish.  D: The quality of this beer is undeniable. Sierra Nevada has done a great job of finding the best and freshest ingredients, and it shows. It's approaching on too bitter for my taste, but I imagine fans of hop-forward beers love it. In any case, it's completely easy to drink and very refreshing for any occasion.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Mild caramel in finish sweetens the aftertaste and keeps the hops in check. Quite a bit going on here and very solid.  M- Medium in body and in carbonation.

140,276,CSAsylum,4.82,"I was a particpant in drug and alcohol study several years ago and the doctor, who was testing brain activity in drinkers after they smelled certain liquors, asked me what my favorite hard liquor was and what my favorite beer was. To the first I answered Makers Mark. To the second, I answered Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. It took me two years to fully appreciate Sierra Nevada Pale Ale again after my two stints in an MRI chamber, smelling various things and thumbing a button whenever I did so.  Nevertheless, I thought then, and still think today, that Sierra Nevada Pale Ale represents the quintessence of American beer. It is, as far as I'm concerned, the beer that comes to mind when people say ""beer.""  A: Pours a bright,clear copper-orange with a full finger of tawny head which dimishes quickly to something less than 1/4 finger and then after the first drink disappears completely.  S: Wonderful aromatic citrusy and floral hops aroma arrives immediately and dominates the nose.  T: Hops and malt dance together here. Hops first as you take it in, probably a leftover from smelling them as you bring the glass to your mouth but then a mild malty sweetness. The leave has a touch of bitterness from the hops and the whole thing makes sense like an EB White essay that ends where it begins but you're better off for having read it.  M: I think the mouthfeel is soft, not creamy but full and sweet. I think it leans on the heavy side of light but because of the hop brightness the slight heaviness of the body is a perfect balance.  Overall: I can barely add to the introduction, this is American Pale Ale as far as I'm concerned and that makes it the Americeyness of all American beers. Superb always, all the time.  If I could improve this beer, and I wouldn't really try, I would like the head to last longer and lace better. I would prefer a more robust color. But, aren't those incredibly minor wishes?

140,276,itfitz,4.97,"I remember the first time I tried a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. It was (at that time) the most different beer I'd ever had. It was the early 1990's and I had just moved from Michigan, where I'd been exposed to mass-produced tasteless beers all my life. I'd fallen in love with Samuel Adams lager, which was quite hard to find due to the relative lack of distribution.  The aroma from the spicy hops hits your nose as you pour it from the bottle. The beer comes out with an amber-orange color with a perfect amount of foam and fantastic lacing in the glass. The bitterness is not overpowering, but adds just enough to counterbalance the smooth caramel maltiness.  The mouthfeel is wonderful, and although not thin, it doesn't come across as a heavy beer. The perfect carbonation combined with the wonderful taste gives this a drinkability like few other beers, and this is my everyday go-to beer (and has been for almost two decades now).  This is Sierra Nevada's flagship beer for a reason. It can be a session beer or an accompaniment to a gourmet meal (or pizza or burgers).",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Taste: Floral sweetness quickly followed by hoppy bitterness reminiscent of pine and citrus rinds up front. Malty sweetness in the middle followed by a nice bitter finish.

A- Quintessential golden amber with a beautiful head  S- Very floral and slightly citrus  T- Very smooth and not too hoppy.

There is a light sweet malt flavor too. It's very light on the tongue... but still has some flavor  M- very carbonated and crisp  D- this is a very drinkable beer. It's so crisp and flavorful that it goes down easily. However, the primary properties of the brew (citrus/pine notes) make it so it can't be dunked all at once.

140,276,rfabian,4,"After years of thinking I didn't like pale ale I finally learned that the taste I had come to associate with it was that of a skunked beer. It's an association that still makes me leery of the style -- memories and associations laid down in the limbic lobes color one's emotions for life, and so it takes elaborate rituals of storage and the assurance of freshness for me to feel right about sampling one. Better yet to have the brew screened by a reliable taster.  Poured into a tumbler it produces a nice thick head with ample lacing. The appearance is light amber and clear. After prying it out of the hands of the taste tester, who just ""wanted to be sure, dude,"" I pondered the aroma at length for evidence of skunk, but the smell is of nice citrus hops and a hint of malt. The taste is mainly sweet malt and mildly bitter. It is medium bodied with a clean finish.

The smell is interesting, I'm hit with a caramel sweetness at first, which gives way to the typical hoppy smell - bitter and floral with citrus.  The taste is similiar to the smell, but the sweetness is missing. The rest of the taste is typical IPA - bitter at the end and hoppy and citrusy at the front. The beer isn't overly bitter, though, pretty decent for the style.  The mouthfeel is light and refreshing, the bitterness clings a little bit, though.  Drinkability is fairly decent, IPA is probably my least liked beer style (Gasp!), however, the not-overly bitter nature of SN Pale Alr made it fairly drinkable for me, especially in these hot summer days.

Grapefruit becomes more dominant with sour juice, not sweetness. Some bready malt intercedes before grapefruit pith bitterness finishes.

S- A semi sweet smell, very hoppy with a slight hint of citrus, maybe even a carmel like candy smell as well.  T- A little hoppy with an explosive after taste with a little splash of citrus and a twist of sweetness that leaves an amazing after taste.  MF- Coats the mouth well and like I said before it has a beautiful after taste with a splash of citrus that I have grown to love over the years.

140,276,popery,4,"SNPA is a great accomplishment. Plus, it was one of the first beers that I ever drank, years before I would drink another craft beer, and it's shaped my view of beer. I have no idea how to rate it because it's essentially my yardstick for every APA, IPA and DIPA that I've ever tried. Anyway, it's a darkened amber color with a wonderfully foamy head. The aroma is a wonderful combination of piney hops and caramel malt. The flavor starts sweet and finishes dry and hoppy. Mostly clean mouthfeel with a touch of slickness in the aftertaste. The finish has a healthy dose of hop bitterness for an APA. This beer is an absolute classic.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Fairly clean taste, really balanced and subtle flavor profile which really makes this the definition of craft beer. There is a nice bitter backing to this all that cleans the palate nicely.  Mouthfeel: Very light and crisp.  Drinkability: This is definitely a sit around and drink a sixer beer. This is my go to when looking for a relatively cheap beer that I can drink all day.

I doubt anything has changed at the brewery. Beer looked golden-copper colored with a white head and nice lacework on the glass. It had a resiny, pine-like aroma. The hop bitterness was lacking and it tasted more sweet than usual. Not as dry as I remember. This beer was balanced - in a bad way. It normally finishes more dry.

The malts are a bit nutty and the hops are florally. Really has a good bite to it. I love the last flavor of the sip because its somewhat buttery.  M- Its light and smooth and a crisp finish.

Dissipates to a thin layer of head with lacing on the glass. Clear golden amber color.  Smell: Citrus, floral aromas, pungent hop odor.  Taste: Somewhat bitter and very hoppy, but not overly. Crisp and clean. A very bright flavorful beer with a light lingering after-taste of grains.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and reasonably carbonated.

Looks yummy. Also slight amounts of lace on the way down  Smell- Hops and slight pine smells. Nothing too big or overpowering. Maybe my nose is broken.  Taste- Up front hops fade to malty goodness as the brew makes its way to the back of my mouth. More woody/pine flavor is detected. I love the way the hops hit fast then even out to leave a clean palate.  Mouthfeel- Very smooth. Not too light, but enough to let you know its there and then gone. Crisp and once again smooth. Good carbonation.  Drinkability- Man, this is one drinkable beer. I feel I could easily down a sixer of these and keep rolling. I would say a good transition beer. You could go either way from here, either more malty or hoppy.  Notes- From growing up in CA, Sierra Nevada has always been near the top of my list as far as breweries.

A mix of copper and gold with some pretty big bubbles rising. Thick white head recedes but leaves great amounts of marbled lacing.  S- Smells extremely fresh and hoppy yet it doesn't really smell like fresh hops. Or maybe I just haven't had the chance to smell the very hops they've used. Some of the best grassy hops I've had the chance to smell yet. Piney and a bit woody. Malt seems to soften up the whole thing. Don't know what else tosay. It smells really goodand I can't wait to taste it. Warmer now and the honey comes out.  T- The smell led me on to think this would be sweeter. It really isn't. A lot less going on than in the smell. Piney overall and wood finish. Didn't blow me away but I'm sure I'd be very happy to always have this on hand. It's a simple yet very interesting taste.  M- Medium carbonation.

It has a nice golden hue. It has a nice hoppy aroma. The malt comes through as I drink. The taste doesn't quite match the aroma. There is the malt backbone with some hops.

Leaves some nice lacing going down.  Smells very nice. Floral with hops is the main note here-with some butter biscuit smells too.  Tastes alot like it smells with the hops the overwhelming note. A light malt backbone comes in too which is nice and then it finishes a bit dry. Some citrus notes join the floral aroma-but not too much.  This goes down pretty smooth for an APA and that's probably another reason it is so popular. Not heavy or light and leaves you wanting another.  This is my favorite style of beer, and although not my favorite of this type, I can see why it is so popular.

S - The nose is a balance between hops and malts. The malts are slightly more predominant and are sweet, with some caramel. The hops are present but not to the degree that I expected. There is a floral hop aroma (not really much citrus, which is what I expected).  T - The taste follows the nose - sweet malts with an ever so faint hint of floral hops. The hops initially came through more so in the aftertaste, but after getting half way thorough the bottle the hops became more notable with some citrus and floral notes.  M - Light to medium body; some chew and also a nice smoothness to it. The carbonation is noticeable and is the expected amount for this style.  D - An excellent pale ale.

S - Subdued savory, spicy, grassy and herbal hops sit upon a rich amber malt.  T - The taste is just pure humulus; lemon-y, tea, grassy and herbal. There is a sturdy but unobtrusive malt backbone.

S: Picking up some moderately fresh hops over some subtle malts.  T: This beer has all the usual suspects for pale ale that is leaning towards an IPA. A variety of semi-fresh hops swirl and cascade over the top of a foundation of sweet toasty malts. All this smooths out with a slightly more bitter finish than I was expecting. The aftertaste lingers shorter than expected, but is a good one.  M: Smooth but fresh with a nice balance of carbonation. The body is on the lighter side, but that lends to the drinkability nicely.  D: A very drinkable and pleasing APA. Not over-powering, and because of this it can be a fine session beer for the hop-seeker that doesn't want to blister his palate with one of the many American hop-bombs.  Overall: Arguably, this beer is (in my opinion) one of the ""Big Three"" beers that facilitates the conversion of great number of Bud/Miller/Coors drinkers into craft drinkers (the other two being Sam Adams Boston Lager and Guinness Draught). I wonder how many hoppy APAs and IPAs exist today because of the success of this beer.

Enough complexity to keep it interesting but not extraordinary Most macro drinkers cannot take the bitterness down although I feel it's not that strong. Finish is medium and doesn't stick around too long.  Mouthfeel: Nice body without being heavy. Great for the style. Goes in and out very easily.  Drinkability: This is my favorite session beer.

140,276,legatovibrato24,4.47,"Has been my standby for quite a while, just now getting around to reviewing it.  Pours a medium amber color, with a great head that laces the glass with enthusiasm. Taking a whiff of this beer yields a nose full of hops and yeast. The bouquet is complex enough to entice the seasoned craft beer drinker, but lacks the intimidation to make a novice cringe. Great balance.  The first thing you are hit with once sipped is a full plate of hops. At times there is almost a citrus flavor coming through the hops, although nowhere near what is found in the Torpedo IPA, with its inclusion of the citra hop. A slight malt flavor can be had, but the dominating notes are those of hops and caramel.  Although there is plenty of flavor, the beer itself does not have a heavy body. I would classify it as a medium bodied hoppy beer.  This is an easy beer to fall in love with. It's medium bodied nature lends itself to great sessions, as does it's low ABV of 5.6%, as compared to other hoppy pale ales and IPA's.

There is a decent amount of bready/biscuit malt. Evens out the beer.  T: Lots of good hop flavor that is balanced by a lot of bready malts. This is a very tasteful and flavorful beer.  M: Leaves a nice clean somewhat bitter taste on the palate. Quite refreshing.  D: This is an easy to drink APA. This is a beer I use as a 'gateway' beer for non-micro drinking friends to get them into craft beers.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,alkemy,3.75,"Clear and copper pour with a fluffy white head. Hops are certainly apparent, but pretty tame. Scent mostly dominated by citrus, specifically orange peel. You also get some sweet caramel malt aromas. It's pretty refreshing. A nice session beer for sure. The citrus hops are most noticeable just as in the scent. Caramel, bready malts come in toward the back. Finish is crisp and clean.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,animalchin,4.18,"A - Fatter, short neck bottle - signature Sierra Nevada. Pours a dark orange with red-orange hues shimmering through the glass. A layer of head that is consistent with moderate lacing.  S - Sweet orange, sharp hops that is assisted along with some doughy malts.  T - A GREAT balance of hops and malts. I'm having a hard time deciphering what comes through more. There is certainly a bread like degree that signifies some toasted maltiness, but at the same time there is a more tangier, citrus situation from the hops.  M - Smooth and lubricated. Has a lot of mobility.  D - Another please.  Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is my favorite beer. It took me a long time to realize this, and the reasons for this statement are long and boring. I say this is my favorite beer on the basis of aesthetic, economic and contextual terms.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,Beerandraiderfan,4.83,"So I never reviewed this? This is probably my ""if you could only have one beer etc. . ."" type choice. The world gold standard.  Pours a great dark yellow and amber hue, minimal head, not much lacing. Aromatic whole flower hops. The three C's.  Taste, unlike anything else. The most mass produced hoppy bitter beer out there. Pine and citrus. Tastes like Chico. Great throughout. Drinkable for days, great price. And unmistakable mouthfeel of bitter hops and unique as hell tree/pine kind of flavor going for it. So much caramel and yet the bottle conditioning keeps the carbonation peppy and perfect so that the caramel is never heavy.  The first time I drank this beer (UC Davis keg party in '93) I was a senior in high school, and I hated it. I asked the party host if he washed his cups because the beer tasted like it had soap in it. What a noob. . .",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Very eazy and likeable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,NA1NSXR,3.86,"Appearance - Light amber/dark golden, medium size foamy head, medium-light lacing.  Smell - Smells great, sweet with a lot of citrus aromas, some caramel comes through as the beer warms up.  Taste - Starts hoppy, ends malty/bready. Balanced flavor with medium bitterness, citrus aromas contribute lightly to taste without adding tart. It is all very good, but lacks any defining element of the taste.  Mouthfeel - Medium consistency, carbonation is enough to strike a feeling in your mouth but not too much.  Drinkability - Overall very good. Drinks a bit below its abv. Its simply a very solid beer with some slight additional bitterness and citrus overtones.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,BillyBoysPie,4.08,"Bottle into a pint glass.  Pours a clear orange/gold with a full inch of dense, white foam. Retention is fine, just a little layer of foam, but plenty of lacing.  Florals and, what's this I smell... oh yeah, Cascade hops! Plenty of the citrus expected, but not overpowering/strong. It all sits neatly atop a firm pale malt background.  Taste is ever so clean, ever so easy. Taste begins with a hint of lemon and lime and moves quickly into the pale malt. Nothing caramel or toasty, just unadulterated malt. The bitters return at the end with some pith coming across with the typical alpha oil clean flavor. Creamy, well carbonated, and easy to drink.  This beer is hard not to like unless there's a component of it that you're allergic to. Goes great with all sorts of summer food fare, but has enough backbone to justify just drinking it because you like it. Quintessential APA, and a great brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

A good crisp taste, citric tones, bitter orange, malty aromas like digestive biscuits.  A rather high carbonation, a medium body and in all a refreshing feeling.

S: Smells crisp and clean. Faint citrus; hops and some malt.  T: Unsurprisingly, the beer tastes how it smells - good, crisp, with citrus notes dominated by malty hops. A mild bitterness balances the flavours well. The finish is oddly bready, but not too dry and certainly pleasant.  M: The carbonation, citrus, and hops conspire to create a refreshing beer that keeps me sipping 'til the glass is empty.  D: Exceptional indeed. A great beer for drinking, sharing, and enjoying.

140,276,bosox941827,4.33,"12 oz bottle into imperial pint glass Long time drinker of SNPA, just now getting around to a review... A - ""Classic"" pale ale, orange decent head retention with a rough pour, dissipates fairly quickly. Absolutely clear. S - Nice biscuit-y malt aroma, mixed w/light hop aroma after the pour. T & M - Caramel-y malt flavor, evolving into a nice spicy mid-palate with a solid, lingering Cascade hop-finish, with just a hint of alcohol flavor mixed in at the end for good measure. Hop finish is extremely pleasant and for me what separates this pale ale from others. A bit more carbonated than other SN offerings, with some prickly carbonation at the beginning.... D - Yeah, through the roof...could drink these all night, and have..

Coppery orange to yellow in hue, hazy, lighter and more transparent around the rims. The herbal hops get out in front of the pack in the nose, the white grapefruit, orange pith follows behind, grainy with a spicy edge, more lactose than florality or maltiness, sheer activity seems to be its strongest aspect. Medium-bodied plus, here its relative lack of movement gives it more gravitas. Sweet touch to the orange, grapefruit citrus, floral dimension a bit stunted. Malts undistinguished, smooth things texturally but don't add much flavor, light brown sugar. Peach, apricot fruit demure.

140,276,sweemzander,4.15,"12oz. bottle poured into an imperial pint. Bottled sometime in Jan 2010 I think.  (A)- Pours a clear caramel colored amber that produced a large white head that dissipated down to a light frothy layer. Left tons of sticky webbing behind in the process.  (S)- Citrus of lemon, lime, & pineapple with a good piney background. Bits of honey-like caramel sweetness; very subtle though.  (T)- Great dry pine with a burst of lemon citrus. Light honey/caramel sweetness. Bitter, but fits the level for the style.  (M)- A good carbonation level & balance to it. Crisp & refreshing. A great mix of dryness, citrus, bitterness, & malt. Smooth.  (D)- A superb example of the style. An easy drinker for sure. Not overly bitter, malty, or dry, but just right. Always a great summer APA in my opinion.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Some toasty notes.  M= green-hops bitter but nice to savor if you enjoy that flavor; malts keeping my mouth watery.  D= very drinkable if you enjoy strong hops-bitter ales.

Just crazy bubbly and rich and foamy.  S- No doubt about it, this is a pale ale. Effective hop aroma, but backed with a crisp sweetness. Weak aroma, could've been stronger.  T- Mmm, so freakin' tasty. So balanced you don't expect the pronounced hops finish. Not overpowering, but it's noticeable. Stout malt backbone provides a solid foundation for the playful hops. Florals, sweet breads, herbal bitterness, very slightly dry finish. Solid taste, a very well made beer here.  M- Crisp tiny bubbles, nothing too much, it's all nicely played down to let the flavors do their thing. Medium light body with a pleasent mellowness. Not sticky bitterness left over.  D- Very high.

140,276,apbarwood,3,"A bright, brownish-gold color with a small pure-white head. Retention is lacking with only the finest amount of lace. It takes a pretty aggressive pour to get some head. Aromas are faint but pleasant nonetheless. Ditto that on the flavor. You get what you'd expect basically but in small amounts with a good balance between fruit bitterness and pine with some herbal hop notes and just enough malt to hold everything together. The body is mediumish and the feel is slightly undercarbonated. The thing that this beer has going for it is that it's balanced exceptionally well, but it isn't going to knock anyone's socks off. I really wanted more out of it particularly from the hops. This is definitely brewed with the larger market in mind. That being said, it's not bad, there's nothing offensive about this beer at all and I think it's a good training wheel pale ale but fans of more flavorful styles of pales will be well suited to look elsewhere.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Nice bit of malt a then a small hop kick, makes it very drinkable and not unlike a milder IPA. Nicely balanced.  Good carbonated mouthfeel, very drinkable.

Smell is better though, with a clear burst of hops coming through. Nothing too overwhelming, which is good, but hard to detect any sort of pale malt to back it up.  Taste is very enjoyable. Good hoppy backbone, clearly a little more support from the malt than I could detect in the nose.  Mouthfeel is surprisingly creamy -- didn't expect that out of a beer this color.

140,276,Hojaminbag,4.1,"It's basically a mystery to me how I haven't managed to review this beer yet; I always just assumed that I already had.  Sierra Nevada Pale Ale has a clear copper body with some fairly active carbonation bubbles moving around inside. About a finger and a half of light tan/off-white head sprouts up and has some ok retention and a little bit of lacing.  The aroma has a good dose of hops that exude bitterness and grapefruit along with a decent amount of sweet malts to balance it out.  Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, when fresh, is a very hoppy APA (which I think is a good thing). When this beer was handed to me already poured, I guessed that it was the Sierra Nevada Torpedo. After re-investigating the Torpedo there are obvious differences, but this APA has a pretty similar hop profile to the Torpedo. Lots of bitter, grapefruit flavored hops with a touch of pine resin in there. A slightly sweet malt presence balances the beer out with biscuit and light caramel flavors.  Mouthfeel is a little light in body and a little high in carbonation, but it is a little bit oily the make up for the lighter body.

T - Citrus up front in flavor, closely followed by the smooth, bready malt. Bitterness is pretty moderate but lingers long after, along with the fresh grapefruit flavor.

Nice one finger head with light lacing throughout.  Scents of Pale Malt, Cascade hops waft through the air while pouring this beer. I picked up some pine scent/resin...

140,276,MellowG,4.03,"Fine, enjoyable, and widely available. Available at almost any decent deli or supermarket that sells beer here in NYC, which counts for a lot.  I like the hoppy but not excessively so characteristic of an American Pale Ale vs. an IPA. There are so many overwraught IPAs avaialbe today, and SNPA is a refreshng alternative. As one who found his way to better/fine beer by discovering ale an bitter in England (better the more north one goes), I find this and many/most other American PAs and IPAs to be overcarbonated for my liking, thereby reducing mouthfeel. But that's just my preference.  As it happens, SNPA has a nice, full and satisfying flavor that would benefit from less carbonation, to allow those flavors to come through.  All this is relative, however. SNPA is SO far ahead of the light yellow upbiquitous mainstream American beers, and in fact, way ahead of the top European imported Lagers. And it's American and available. So, go for it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

S: Very light, some pine, some subtle not flattering metallic nose.  T: This, again, is where I was most disappointed. Very thin flavor, lacked anything particularly redeeming or strong. To be honest the metallic nature reminded me of Kirin, but it did finish like a traditional IPA. Definitely tasted pine, and a lot of hops - too much in fact.  M/D: Thin and a little too dry.

Not too bad, in Switzerland.  Sierra Nevada Pale Ale: Classic American craft with good worldwide distribution (bought this one @ Drinks of the World - Basel). A: First of all, nice bottle art. Beautiful golden-orange color. One to two fingers white head, which dissipates reasonably fast (but I think this is because of the chalice, should use a proper glass). Medium carbonation, anyway. Some particles floating around. S: A hop bouquet. Pleasant. Malt (soft). Despite of being an APA, reminded me an IPA. T: Good stuff. Refreshing first of all. Perfect for a summer barbecue (Not for the current Swiss 0ºC). Fresh hops and malt. Delicate bitterness. I've heard that's a 37 or 38 IBUs. In fact, some times, it gives the impression of being a little bit more than this. M: Good. Quite balanced bitterness. A bit bitter end but does not overload the taste sense. Medium carbonation.

140,276,biboergosum,4.12,"12oz bottle at Beer Bistro in the heart of downtown Toronto's suit-heavy, after market closing dining district.  This beer pours a clear, medium bronzed amber colour, with two chubby fingers of puffy, somewhat bubbly, but eventually creamy off-white head, which leaves a consistent wall of broken webbed lace around the glass in its slow and meandering wake.  It smells of biscuity caramel malt, grapefruit, blood orange, and lemon citrus rind, and mildly dank spicy, earthy piney, and grassy hops. The taste is predominantly citrus forward (orange and overripe lemon, mostly), with a sort of white pepper spicy character, more leafy, weedy, and pine hop notes, and a lightly bready caramel malt backbone.  The carbonation is moderate in its well supportive and generally playful frothiness, the body a solid-ass middleweight, and smooth, with a mild creamy slickness. It finishes more than a bit off-dry, the green and citrus hoppiness still in an agreeable detente with the lingering caramel malt.  SNPA is obviously common as water Stateside, but for some retarded reason very difficult to come by on this side of the border. Overall it tastes pretty much like my favourite local hopped-up pale ale (Alley Kat Full Moon, for the record, which was apparently heavily influenced by it), so, yeah, I can't help but like this one a lot.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Great fresh pinecone aroma, slightly woody, but has a nice balanced aroma and the hops arent too overpowering.  Taste: Tastes incredibly smooth and pure. you get a real sense of the craft beer industry when drinking this beer. Its got a homemade, earthy and rustic essence to it, yet it is remarkably consistant each batch. Good firm hops in the forefront and the palate is smoothed out by nice caramelly malts. The hops are sweet and slightly sticky. Grapefruit, wood, and a nice lemon peel component come through.  Mouthfeel: perfect carbonation. the beer finishes slightly dry which is great after the hops from the beer make you pucker up. completely balanced and smooth on the palate and in my opinion a style leader for sure.

I had never really given Sierra Nevada much attention since they are now easily found in supermarket and larger stores throughout the states. I can't believe I have gone this long without it!  (a)- The beer pours perfectly and left an inch of head in the pint glass. The color is a rich and deep amber tone and looks like a great natural beer. (4.5/5)  (s)- I've never really had a good sniffer, but its easy to pick out the floral hops and frangrance. It's not as strong as it looks, but you can tell you're in for some delicious malt and orange spices as well. (4/5)  (t)- Very very VERY good. Definetely one of my favorite pale ales. You can taste this brew from front to back. At first taste it may seem very complex, but this full-bodied beer finishes just as strong and balanced as it starts. Perfect amount of hops, citrus and malts. Let me stop so I can get another sip before mouthfeel. (4.5/5)  (m)- Full-bodied, none of it gets lost from the tip of the tongue to the back of the throat. Warming sensation which is unusal for me because its not the typical citrus brew, but it is just a lil higher in ABV% than similar pale ales with these accents. Not too carbonated, great great beer. (4.5/5)  (d)- I typically reserve pale ales for mid-flight, but this one might be the exception. Goes great with normal foods and isn't as heavy as it seems. For a pale ale I can see myself drinking a fair amount without the palet going crazy. Around 40 IBUs so its just in that range where its not too much to notice on a busy night!

Malt is slightly sweet and caramel-flavored; hops tend more toward the earthy, funky and floral in the flavor than was the case in the aroma. Bitterness is quite high. Quite tasty.  Mouthfeel: medium body with a good level of carbonation for the style. It works, though it doesn't blow me away.  Drinkability: pretty drinkable.

140,276,CRichardsMN,3.97,"Appearance: Pours out a clear amber orange body with a light though creamy off-white head. Retains head for a short while then falls to more of a film and ring which leaves lots of lace behind. Don't know if it is the norm, but there are a few floaters which eventually settle to the bottom (really the only visual detraction IMO).  Smell: Light maltiness and a nose full of hops. Much more hops than I would have expected from a straight up PA, more like a EPA or IPA.  Taste: Again, light maltiness or biscuit and mostly citrusy hops. Finishes cleanly with a moderate amount of bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a crisp carbonation. Smooth and dry finish.  Drinkability: Not typically into pale ales (or higher) but this one is very well done. If it fit my palate, I'm sure I'd have multiples of this one around.  Comment: This is only my second brew from SN and I was a bit gun-shy (so shy in fact that not until a neighbor gave me this one did I venture forth...). The first was Bigfoot, which was not a welcome brew as it was more like biting into a grapefruit rind then getting punched in the back of the head.

140,276,TheMadJack,3.98,"Poured from 12oz. Bottle into Glass Mug  Pours a honey orange with nice thick, white head. Good lacing - at two-thirds the way through, there is still a sharp, clear line where the foam originally came to. The beer is not quite perfectly clear.  Smells of flowery hops - jasmine and honeysuckle notes readily apparent. Touch of pine and orange zest.  The beer is literally bittersweet: upon first contact there is a sudden honey-like sweetness with a crisp piney, grassy bitterness. Bready malts form a base, more of a texture than a flavor. Bitterness lingers on the finish.  Crisp, with a little bit of stickiness to the malts and in the finish. The carbonation helps serve to thicken the mouthfeel.  This is a versatile, enjoyable brew that's not a challenge to drink nor too heavy on the stomach. Only thing keeping this beer from a perfect 5 is the sticky bitter finish that lingers just a bit long - I feel like I need to wash my mouth out with something less ...sticky and lingering? Sure, we'll phrase it that way. Otherwise, very good.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

T- Not as complex as their other beers, but there is a hint of citrus, malt, and yeast.  M- On the light side of medium bodied, lots of carbonation makes for a quick dry finish.  D- Very enjoyable.

140,276,wnh,4.33,"12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass.  Pours a bright golden amber, full of suspended yeasty sediment but still clear, capped by a thick, foamy, pristine white head.  Typical Sierra Nevada hop notes on the nose--pithy underripe citrus zest and pine resin--with a touch of leafiness. A nice toasty, biscuity malt backbone holds up the hops.  Sweeter on the palate than the nose indicates, with a fruitiness that suggests yeast rather than malt. A fleeting note of caramel-like malty sweetness shows up mid-palate, then fades into a bitter but faintly sweet underripe citrus note. Finishes clean but mildly yeasty, with just a touch of lingering bitterness.  Light to medium in body and relatively soft; very quaffable, perhaps the most quaffable pale ale I've had. There seem to be two extremes in pale ales: those that rely almost solely on the hops (Lagunitas, for example), and those whose hops are all muddled up in the rest of the beer. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale manages to land right between those two paths, with hops that make themselves clear but don't dominate the beer.  Worthy of its place in the American craft beer pantheon.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,drtth,3.93,"Served in an shaker pint glass. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically.  Appearance: As served the beer is a bright clear light copper color with a ½"" white head that leaves sticky lacing on the glass as it recedes. Sipping leaves a nice pattern. By the end of the beer there is only a small ring of foam leaving some light speckles of lacing. There is a spider web of lacing still stuck to the upper inch or so of the glass.  Smell: The aroma is fresh, clean, lightly scented with floral and citric hops (grapefruit zest mostly) and a light caramel aroma.  Taste: The flavor is slightly sweet with the light caramel flavor laying over the mild floral and grapefruit hop flavors. The bitterness is restrained by the malt sweetness and is noticeable but does not dominate.  Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is medium bodied with light but persistent carbonation. The finish is medium long with the hop bitterness bursting through and concealing the malt before the bitterness fades away into dryness.  Drinkability: This is a very drinkable beer in many ways. Not only would I like another, I have enjoyed this beer in the past and I'm sure I'll be having it again. It goes nicely as a counterpoint to lightly spiced foods and is a nice, all-around beer.

Moderately-low hop flavour with a solid, biscuity malt backbone with hints of caramel. While there is substantial bitterness this is a very balanced APA with lots of malt to hold it up.

Nice piney hoppy smell with a decent malt background. A more impressive smell than your average pale ale.  Had an interesting taste of almost a combination of piney and citrus hops. Not what I usually expect from a pale ale, but a good surprise. Had a bready/biscuitty taste towards the finish.  Nice medium body, with good carbination.  Very drinkable beer.

M - not too dry like some brews very pleasant, a little light perhaps, but I like that in an ale like this. Feels like carbonated spring water and hops flavors.

Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  A - Pours a nice golden orange color with about 2 fingers worth of soft, pillow head. The head is a slightly off colored white. There is a nice amount of lacing left on my glass.  S - I get piney hops coupled wit a lemony-citrus scent. There is a sweetness from the malts present as well.  T - Pretty much follows the nose. Lemony citrus flavor with piney hops. There is just a touch of sweetness mid palate with the biterness of a pale ale that lingers on the aftertaste. There might be a slight bit of woodsy taste in there too.  M - Light bodied with good carbonation. An excellent crisp and refreshing beer.  D - A very easy to drink and sessionable beer.

140,276,mckeowbc,4.52,"This is my all time favorite session beer. It has a nice punch of Cascade hops that give it a nice floral bouquet and clean almost grassy taste without being overbearing. The moderate alcohol content and light malt flavor makes this a beer that is easy to drink and doesn't wear on the palate like heavier or hoppier beers. Also this beer pairs well with almost any food, but beef or spicy barbecue seem the most appropriate.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,carwreCk,3.95,"SNPA smells of citric hops. Taste is pretty hop-forward with citrus and pine. Not much detected from the malts. Bitter on the end.

140,276,manahansf,4.77,"Pours a clear, light copper/blonde color with a light and lacy white head. Through the glass you can see the high carbonation levels as bubbles float to the surface and send out a noseful of citrus hops aroma. The drink is very smooth and well balanced. A generous helping of citrus hops overpower the slight hints of complementing malt. The body is very light, crisp, and refreshing. It finishes with a smooth reminder of the citrus bitterness and fades out slowly.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,afausser,3.86,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a hazy deep amber with a finger of head. There is TONS of carbonation that is persistent even as the beer sits, which results into a fluffy, bubbly, foamy head that lasts a decent amount of time. There is also a very nice sheet of fine lacing.  Smell: Piney, yeasty, and light, with faint citrusy hints of tangerine and orange.  Taste: Again, piney and citrusy, with oranges, lemons, and grapefruit that blend nicely with the hops. There is also a floral/herbal element, out of which I'm picking out oregano and mint. I'm actually also getting a very faint hint of strawberries out of it. Pine, oranges, lemons, and hops in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Light--but the carbonation makes it start out a bit foamy. This, fortunately, improves as it sits.  Drinkability: The mouthfeel knocks this down for me a bit, I think, but the taste is light and nice.

However, I've never reviewed it...UNTIL NOW  A: Pours a light amber, with a one finger off-white head that collapses into a cap that sticks around.  S: Grassy and citric. Hops become more pronounced as it warms.  T: Ah, that old, familiar taste. I've never really tried to describe it until now. It starts out sweet and malty. This is followed by sharp pine and floral hops, with some of the citrus from the nose. The bitterness really stays on the palate. Perfectly balanced.  M: Slick and oily. Medium carbonation.  D: This is the definition of a session beer for me.

This one hung on for dear life till the very end... Brew itself is clear golden. Lacing is weblike and ample and really covered the entire side of the glass.  S: Nose is light peach, spice, grapefruit and tangerine, hops. A slight piney character is also detectable.  T: Starts off rather watery with a light malt backbone the crescendos into a strong hoppiness. Malts fade into the background but is still detectable. Both flavors fade gradually without ceremony, leaving a hoppy aftertaste. Slight citrus throughout. This beer has a split personality. Malts and hops very clean, and very distinct.  M: Light bodied and believe it or not, flat as a pancake. Finishes wet and lingers with hoppiness that really never goes away.  D: Drinkable because of the light bodied and enjoyable because of the simplicity. However, nothing to really think about here and therefore, not as enjoyable as it could be for me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,DrDoitchbig,4.52,"Posting this from notes due to the recent site crash. From now on I'll be saving my reviews on my computer so I can just copy and paste them if such a thing happens again. I know I won't be as happy with this as my original, my notes are just shorthand.  Appearance: Poured somewhat aggressively into my Duvel tulip. The result was a billowing two finger off-white head. Underneath that the beer was a dark amber, bordering on burnt orange. The head diminished throughout and left some minor splotches of lacing.  Smell: That classic Sierra Nevada aroma. Fresh cut pine is the dominant with a hit of lemon-lime citrus just behind it.  Taste: The same wonderful crisp pine and citrus are present from the smell. Following is a great malt backbone that keeps things from getting too hop centric. This beer is just fantastically balanced.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, very smooth and crisp. There is even a bit of creaminess on the finish.  Drinkability: I could honestly drink 10 of these. I finished an entire bomber over the course of this review and frankly I could go for another. For me this is the epitome of session beer.  Overall there may be better American Pale Ales out there, but I haven't had one. Thanks to Sierra Nevada along with Samuel Adams I never have the fear of not being able to find good beer. You can pick this stuff up at just about any place that sells alcohol.

Nothing is over-powering and the flavors blend together nicely.  Medium-bodied brew and moderately carbonated. Leaves a bitter sweet aftertaste.  I'm impressed with this beer.

Nice sweet citric malt aroma with orange overtone, balanced by a light pine hop note. Juicy citric malt meets a dry, herbal hop when first tasted. Notes of orange, melon, green tea and forest leaf come through as it is consumed. Lightly dry, tangy finish. Full enough in body to make for a well-rounded brew, light enough to be consumed in quantity.

The bitterness of the overall hop character is not too overpowering for the light, citrusy taste, yet it still lets you know that it is a pale ale.

But these days I tend to pass my old friend by more often than not, but I know that I can always count on this beer. An especially good fall-back due to its ubiquity.  A - Rich clear copper color with white lacey cap that clings to the sides.  S - Grains and malt with lots of hops on the nose with a spicy, floral, and distinctly earthy aroma which occasionally strikes me just slightly wrong for some reason... but it doesn't by any means ruin the enjoyment of the beer for me, just makes the smell slightly less pleasing.  T - Bready malts and biscuit flavors create a rich and solid foundation for the sharp, floral hoppy flavors to dance and weave through. Citrus, minerals, pine, fruit, flowers, and grass flavors all commingle--a bit muddled, but the it works.  M - Smooth, medium body, light carbonation. A bit of a dry finish.

140,276,jpeterman,4.48,"--Poured from a 12 ounce, brown snub-nose bottle into a shaker pint glass. No drink-by date visible on bottle.--  Appearance- A hard pour yields a sizable, fluffy, off-white 2 finger head, likable to a pillow. Light golden-amber liquid, perfectly clear with no haze whatsoever. (I poured the sediment in, so it is visible, creating a bit of a blur at the bottom of the glass.) Head stays around for about 3 minutes, leaving a nice sticky web of lacing as it goes. A spectacular looking APA.  Smell- Floral hops and pine hit the nose hard at first. A fresh, sweet-yet-sharp grassy scent is dominant, also. Comparison: A perfect summer day. In the background are light malts, and a smidgen of sharp sourdough bread as it warms a bit. Yeast is also prevalent, and some fresh fruits come about with every other whiff or so. Overall an irresistible aroma.  Taste- Just as with the nose, the sharp hop bite comes first; piney and very crisp. A light, sweet malt catches the back of the tongue, along with the yeast. More malt comes in as it warms. A near perfect balance for an APA. Extremely well constructed. My only qualm is that the finish is a bit slick. However, it is by no means drastic.  Body/ Mouth-Feel- Light and crisp, with perfect carbonation and just enough weight on the tongue to keep me interested. Again, a bit slick, but nothing to really complain about.  Drinkability- Easily a session beer. A 6 pack on any evening would be an absolute treat.

A half a finger of white head managed to lace nicely in the oft-rinsed tumbler glass.  S: The nose has a strong hop presence for a pale ale, offering pine and citrus in abundance. A strong caramel backbone provides balance.  T: The ale opens with a very oily hop presence, one that was strong and resiny enough that 'soapy' may be appropriate. Further sips reveal the citrus and pine from the nose. Caramel and biscuit flavors drive the malt profile that is strong enough to stand up to the hops. The malt and hop pairing leaves a nmice finish in the mouth.  M: The mouthfeel, especially when fresh, is tough to beat. The hops are vibrant and oily, coating the palate with each sip.

OVERALL it is a classic, or course. Plenty of flavor, easy drinking.

140,276,coldwarkid,4.2,"Appearance: Into a nonic pint, pours a huge 3 finger, creamy, off white head that leaves nice sheets of lace along the sides of the glass as it eventually settles down into a thin cap. A a radiant, deep golden hue glow when held up to the light.  Smell: Nice, aromatic, floral hoppiness: the standard grapefruit rind and pine aromas, along with hints of apricot and pineapple.  Taste: SNPA is a flavorful ale with more than adequate hop presence and a perfectly modest malt backbone. Mild pine, apricot, and grapefruit balanced with subtle but present malt notes, reminiscent of brown bread baked with honey.  Mouthfeel: Medium to medium-thin body. Perfectly carbonated, like all Sierra Nevada offerings. I find it awesome that they bottle condition all of their beers, even in the 12oz bottles.  Notes: A full flavored session beer. The quintessential American Pale Ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Evocatus,4.3,"Definitely one of the best APAs out there in terms of availability. Pretty common, so you'll find this relatively easily. Pours a nice golden color. Aroma is of hops and wheat with some light citrus. Taste matches aroma, also has a slightly stronger carbonation mouthfeel. Great beer to start someone off with.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,generalnotsew,4,"A: Nice 2 finger head it just disappears a little too quickly. Nice amber color and good lacing.  S: Piney, citrusy, earthy hops with a bit of malts backing them up.  T: Very clean and very balanced. Nice hop character with perfect malt backbone.  M: Perhaps a bit too carbonated for my taste. This is why I actually prefer Doggie Style over this. But still 2nd place for me.  D: Goes down very smooth. It is gone before you know it.  Not many APA's really stand up to this American classic. And yes I do believe it has earned the title American classic as it is actually starting to stand out against the macros. Price, availability, taste and drinkability are the reasons why this is APA around. Great gateway beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Jae27,3.16,"Poured from the bottle into a standard Grumpy Dave's pint glass.  A. Clear amber to yellow with a bubbly head dominated by CO2 carbonation. Not bottle fermented. No yeast. No CO2 nucleation.  S. Very light hoppyness. Nothing really strong comes through. I may be getting another cold, so I'll have to check this again later.  T. Pretty floral hops, not overly floral, just to much for my tastes. hops taste and smell like a combination of Cascade hops and Nobile hops. This is just speculation no real evidence for this. No malt flavors at all. The finish is bitter which is nice.  Not really an APA guy, but this is one of the better I have had. Nice change from the RIP's and porters I usually drink. Nice beer overall. Nothing really special though.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,MetalHopHead6,4.1,"Sierra Nevada Pale Ale poured light straw with a thick two-finger head. Thick lace sank and disappeared quickly. The color was lighter than I like.  The smell and taste were citric and light, with a bit of an acidic aftertaste. The feel was crisp and slightly bitter and the ale was very refreshing.  Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is the best widely-available beer I've had. It's a pleasure to find it on the menu at a restaurant with a poor selection. It also would serve very well as an every-day beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Small lacing appeared on the side of the glass as I drank.  The aroma of light pine hop with a clean grains dominated. The taste was mild with just a hint of pine and some sourness on the finish.

Nice drinkable beer, this one could carry you through the evening easily.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,natelocc787,4.1,"This was a whole different experience on tap. My review of the bottle came out to a B-, however it may have been an old bottle because on tap this was MUCH more like the classic APA it claims to be. Very hoppy, piney and citrusy in the nose, nice sheets of lace left on the pint glass but disappear after a few minutes. Great color to the beer and the taste is very refreshing and hoppy with crisp fruit and pine showing their muscles. Very drinkable and very nicely done. I must say it was a totally different experience on tap.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,BrewitYerself,2.86,"Poured into a frosted glass before I could stop the bartender.  Pours a clear dark copper, thick dense head, some lacing.  Smells of bready/slightly sweet malt with fruity/floral hops and mild esters.  Taste is pungently bitter and sour upfront. Pithy and herbal, almost vegetal. Finishes pretty clean with a moderate lingering pithy sour-bitterness. Not much malt on the palate - just a touch of breadiness and very slight sweetness.  Mouthfeel is very thin, overcarbonated.  Overall it's too bitter and sour, and not enough malt to balance. Hop aroma and flavor are a bit lacking. The flavors it does have taste stale. As it warms it releases more of a malty-sweet aroma, but there still isn't much more than bitterness on the palate. If someone offered me another, I'd take it, but I wouldn't order it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,drabmuh,4.1,"It was bound to happen sooner or later, I would review one of the beers that brought me to my craft beer revolution. Thank you Sierra Nevada pale ale for showing me the way into the light.  Beer served on draft at a local pub. Beer is clear and yellow with a white head that leaves some lacing on the glass. Carbonation is medium to high.  The aroma is hop filled, mostly citrus but there is some pine character in there. The hops smell great but they overwhelm me and I cannot detect anything else.  Beer has a medium body, and there is a lot of bitterness in the back of the mouth from the hops. There isn't much to speak of in the front or perhaps I am just distracted by the hop bitterness. Drinkability high. One of my favorite stand by beers that is readily available nearly everywhere.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,kjyost,4.3,"Poured into a beer glass which produced a nice foamy nice head and a nice nutty brown colour. It had a nice hoppy aroma about it, which did not disappoint as I drank it. A balanced hoppyness lingers nicely on the palate. A beer I could drink over and over, and makes me wish I could get a beer this good, this cheap in Canada. Sigh.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Josievan,3.9,"Appearance: Pours a fine golden hue with a nice head and lacing.  Smell: Somewhat hoppy, but more piney for me.  Taste: Good old Cascade hops duking it out with a pack of pine trees. This beer makes me want to lie on the cool ground on a late afternoon under immense California pines.  Mouthfeel: Significantly carbonated, with a good moderate weight for an APA.  Drinkability: For me, not sessionable, but very drinkable for an APA, which is not my favorite style.  Overall, this beer's reputation as the Old Faithful of APAs is warranted. Hop-forward beers such as APAs and IPAs aren't exactly my thing, but if I'm craving an APA, this comes to mind. I remember having this beer once before I was really into craft beer. At that time, it was quite a bit too hoppy for me to enjoy it. Now, I clearly see why it's a benchmark for APAs.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Keblar,4,"Only thing I don't care for in this beer is the hoppiness, enough that it could be an IPA rather than a PA.  Slightly cloudy bright golden orange. Good head in the glass. Nice carbonation balance. Decent head that lingers well.  Clean feel, not too bitter. Floral of course. Citrus-y. Someone described it as a grassy tone, and I think fits it pretty well.  Excellent beer, but not my style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,PapaEugene,3.97,"Bought this beer from Mitra van Bergen in Eindhoven, mainly because of my memories being in San Diego. Shared it with BA member rvdoorn.  A: Copper yellow color and a head not worth mentioning.  S: Grapefruit, floral honey and something grassy.  T: Grains, hops, grapefruit and some laurel hints.  M: Low carbonation and thin body.  D: A good beer and still a special one to me. At the time it was the most ""unique"" beer in the conference center that I stayed.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Kooz,2.33,"Lots of high ratings for this beer. Makes me wonder if I got a bad batch. I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as everyone else seemed to.  Taste was just too hoppy. I get it, people like Pale Ales to be hoppy, but this was so overly hoppy that I had trouble getting past it. This goes for both the smell and the taste.  Appearance was nice. It was a light, nut brown. And the mouthfeel was okay, but a bit too bubbly. Over-carbonation is never a plus. But I wouldn't say the mouthfeel was bad.  As for drinkability, I wouldn't have more than one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

S - light grassiness, some bitter hops try mightily to pop through, and suceed. light touch of malts, smells very refreshing.  T - grassy hops are mostly dominant, but balanced nicely throughout by some light sweet maltiness. very pleasant taste, understandable how this beer is often a gateway to some DIPA hop-bombs. has that distinct SN hop taste to it. lovely.  M - light yet full, and crisp yet subtle. a real thirst quencher, one of my perfect summer beers. good enough to a chilly fall night while watching some hockey as well.  D - oh so drinkable. right amount of flavor and character to keep my attention, yet not flashy...efficient. usually have at least a 6'er of this around, as its friendly enough for my non craft drinking friends, yet something i have no hesistations going to when i'm in the mood for a few.  anytime i go a few weeks without having one, the next time i am reminded what a quality beer this is.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

I'm sure glad I took the time to re-discover SNPA.  The brew poured a golden amber color with an off-white head that left nice lacing on my glass. Not too carbonated.  The smell was of citrus and pine. Smells nice and hoppy. The taste was of grapefrit and piney hops up front, while the malts were present afterwards. I am really digging this. Hoppy but not too much as I have had some APA's that were just too piney bitter for my taste.  Drinkability? Gosh, this one went down in a few swallows while reviewing. I can drink a few of these and have before.  Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is the American standard that all other APA's will be judged by in my book. Very tasty.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Poured into an original palm glass. The beer pours a clear copper-yellow color with almost no head and a somewhat messy lacing.  Smell: grapefruit, sweet honey and some dried grass.  Taste: Grapefruit, grains and spicy laurel. Aftertaste is bitter, but not too dry. It resembles a bit a very very diluted Pliny or Borefts bock 2009 from the Molen brewery.  Mouthfeel: watery, thin bodied, medium-low carbonation that nicely tickles the tongue.  Overall: A decent brew.

Taste is somewhat piney, with a sweet aftertaste...perhaps citrus. Some hops, not overwhelming though. Mouthfeel is very nice, some moderate carbonation, very smooth. The best part about this beer is it's drinkability. While perhaps not a session beer, this one begs for you to drink more and pairs very nicely with food (I recently had a bottle with a bleu cheese encrusted steak sandwich which was absolutely divine).

Not bad here, but the aromas are pretty subtle.  T: Full malt flavor up front that gives way to some bitter hoppiness in the back. There are also subtle grain flavors and fresh bread with just a touch of sweetness (apples, grapefruit?). These flavors are well balanced.  M: Medium body and carbonation. Maybe just a little watery at times, but pretty nice.  D: Well balanced flavors, goes down smooth. I could session with this.  Edit, 12/14: After multiple experiences with this I'm upping the drinkability on this to a 5 (from 4).

I love that herbal pine and grapefruit west cost smell. This beer is a true masterpiece. I'm not going to waste time describing the taste other than to say it's as close to perfect beer flavor as humanly possible. All the flavors are absolutlely right on, balanced in exactly the right way. The mouthfeel is creamy enough to be satisfying, but not too heavy to fill you up. It is scary how drinkable this beer is.

140,276,kurp001,4.3,"12 oz. bottle bought at Shawan Liquors  A moderate pour yields about one finger of off-white head that sticks around for quite a while. Body is a slightly-cloudy amber; pretty much classic pale ale appearance, here.  A grassy hop character is notable in the aroma, along with a mild malt presence.  Again, the hop character is the first thing that pulls through on the taste, while a full malt flavor rounds things out on the finish. Great balance, here.  Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and crisp; again, very much in line with the style.  In my opinion, this is one of the most drinkable beers ever, period. Yes, the 5.6% ABV technically disqualifies it from the session beer category, but I find myself making a session out of SNPA way too often. The flavors are just solid without being overpowering, making this a great beer to have a few of.

140,276,PretzelsNBeer,4.3,"This is the gold standard for American Pale Ales - a classic. Drinking the beer out of an american pint glass, the slightly cloudy, off-golden, bottle conditioned beer forms a nice off white head. The head eventually gives way and leaves a nice lace on the glass while the small carbonation bubbles jet to the top of the beer. The aroma gives you a tease of hops but mostly the malty sweetness comes through in the nose. The first sip gives way to that sweet initial taste then it's quickly balanced by the floral hops finishing with a faint bitterness. The mouthfeel is right on target which is on the lighter side of medium bodied. This beer is perfect for complimenting bar food: pizza, wings, poppers, & burgers. It's also a great everyday beer which should occupy any american pale ale lovers beer fridge or beer meister.

This was a bit disappointing, but in appearance only. Has a nice golden brown/tan color.  Smell - Lots of citrus and a bit of pine. I would have to say more grapefruit.  Taste - almost like what it smells. Lots of citrus and pine. Not a hard one to get down at all. I am a big fan of the hop presence in this one. Seems to be at just the right amount.  Mouthfeel - nice, clean carbonation. Maybe a medium body, since it's not light nor much on the heavy side.  Drinkability - This is a great session beer. This is the beer me and my buddies ""go to beer"" if nothing else is available. Very nice beer to have while working on the cars or relaxing on a sunday afternoon watching football.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Wisconsinality,3.67,"A- This one pours a hazy golden color with about 2 fingers worth of head. A bunch of tiny bubbles coming from the bottom of the glass. S- The thing that jumps out at me is the zest of the ale. The smell of grapefruit is pretty predominant. Also a hint of yeast. T- This is a pretty good example of a pale ale. Grapefruit can be picked out right away. There may also be some other fruit like orange in there and a hint of yeast. M- Pretty good overall, a nice medium body with a good amount of carbonation and a little bit of bite from the perceived grapefruit. D- I could have a few of these but I think after that my taste buds would be a little worn out.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

T: Tasted of citrus, malt and hops (a little hoppier than you'd expect from a pale ale, but it still had a nice flavor).  M: A decent amount of carbonation with a very dry finish. Light-bodied.  D: One of the more drinkable mass-produced beers out there. Goes down easy and has a decent taste.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,KrisPaulk77,4.1,"Poured from the classic 12oz. stubby bottle into a Lazy Magnolia pint glass.  THE American Pale Ale pours into the pint a bright, beautiful rich golden orange color with a steady, white substantial head. Good lacing throughout. The aroma is pure west coast goodness. To me, this is what I would hope California would smell like. The citrusy, piney twang of the hops, spicey and floral, are balanced with a good dose of malt sweetness, some bready-ness, and biscuit tones. The taste follows suit and does not disappoint. With a smooth, even, and creamy mouthfeel, the sharp, tangy bitterness starts the show, but the beautiful sweetnees of the malt steps in to balance things out. The alcohol isn't noticed, but the hops linger and the finish dries near the end, but your tastebuds demand another sip. The drinkability is great, and this is a stock ale in my home. This is truly a classic American ale by a classic American brewery, and as I said straightaway, in my opinion, THE classic American Pale Ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,ThreeWiseMen,2.96,"Sampled this on-tap at the brewery this past Thursday (09-03-2009). For those that don't know, every Thursday is cask night at the brewery. Following review written from notes.  Appearance: Two fingers of dense white head sit atop a hazy caramel body. When held to light, shimmers of yellow-orange appear around the edges. No apparent carbonation. Head retention is shorter than expected - quickly settles as a mere crown. Thick spotty lace.  Smell: Wow, lame. Hops have completely fallen out of this one. I get estery alcohol and toasted malt - that's all. This would hardly cut it as an English bitter. Boring.  Taste: Toasted malt and wood, with mild hoppy flavors in the finish. The bitterness and crispness are gone. The hops still affect the flavor profile and consistency, making the beer mildly piney, citrusy, and oily. Finishes grainy and grassy - a touch sour, a touch bitter.  Mouthfeel: There was actually more carbonation to this cask ale than I expected, which was kinda nice. Malty, chewy, light, and clean. The aftertaste is mild and centered around the barley.  Drinkability: I was pretty let down by this one. I was hoping that this cask conditioned SNPA would showcase the beer's malt profile; and while it did bring the malt side into the spotlight, I feel like this beer's shortcomings were just exposed. I didn't have a problem drinking this, but given my time constraints that night this felt like a waste. Oh well, now I know.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,yuenglings,4.15,Nice beer to drink on labor day while im relaxing. Its all preaty close to the same as the torpedo but not as strong of a taste but not weak very well balanced.

140,276,showell,4.24,"This has quickly become one of my favorite beers. It's very available too. My local Safeway carries it :-) . Pours a golden amber, and you can immediately smell the citrus/grapefruit scent. Tastes like grapefruit too. A little sweetness, but not too much. A litle carbonation, but not too much. A little malt, but not too much. Overall, it would be really hard to improve the taste and mouthfeel of this beer, and very drinkable.

140,276,CptAubrey,4.72,"A: Thin white head and yellow-amber beer. A fine-looking beer.  S: Citrusy hops, caramel, and malt. Smells delicious and fresh. Makes one salivate.  T: Sweet, caramelly malt up front followed by citrusy, herbal hops. Moderate hop bitterness. Touch of grain adds depth. Every flavor is lively and fresh and the beer is well-balanced overall.  M: Fine carbonation and light-medium body with an oily finish.  D: Extremely drinkable with perfect balance and surprising depth.

The smell is mildly sweet citris (if that's possible), and a little lemon. The taste follows through with a tart grapefruit with a little nuttiness maybe? The finish is definitely very tart grapefruit. Although, the whole thing seems nicely balanced.  In the mouth it feels clean and filling and crisp. I could drink a couple of these...but I have work to do.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,craftaholic,3.73,"Appearance: Pours a somewhat hazy golden color with a decent finger length head that hits the road after a few sips.  Smell: Hops are evident at the nose, a nice piney herbaceous aroma but nothing too overpowering; quite citrusy as well.  Taste: Super malty smooth from the first sip on... The hops were surprising for being a pale ale almost on par for a light IPA. While the hops are the main characteristic in flavor there is an earthy undertone that balances it out well.  Mouthfeel: Surprising medium body was expecting it to be very light, has enough carbonation and goes down smooth.  Drinkability: Highly drinkable but in my opinion would be too bland to session with.  Overall: One of the better pale ales i've had, has a tinge more hops which is a-ok in my book and the citrus really brings it all together.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,alleykatking,4.3,Figured I would have this on tap one last time before Fat Tire was put on in its place.  A- Pours a good slight haze golden copper color. Nice two finger eggshell white head leaves after a short period but leaves behind lacing on the sides of the glass which doesn't really impress but is big in number which is impressive.  S- Big citrus upfront to this with some bitter hops present. Sweet underlying malt backbone make this beer a little more balanced then what it would be if the malts weren't so apparent. Some earthy underlying hints to this beer as well that I catch from time to time while drinking this.  T- Bitter hops in the front of this beer. Nice kick also right from the get go. Some malts come through in the middle but are quickly tackled by some citrus hops keeping it down. Middle of this beer has a weird earthy grassy taste to it. Nothing bad but it gives it a little more of unique taste to it. Ends on a bitter bite which leaves you wanting to sip on more and more.  M- Light- medium mouthfeel to this beer. Carbonation is dead on and helps lighten up the beer I think. Hops left everywhere on the palate with the aftertaste being bitter and making you yearn for more. The only knock I have on this beer is it seems to be a little on the dry side.  D- This beer is my go to Pale and well my go to beer if nothing else is around. I always come back to this beer even after I drink myself to death on hopbombs or extreme maltbombs. This beer is refreshing and always does the trick. would recommend to everyone. Great gateway beer into the craft world.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Bitter and sweet at the same time. Very nice.  M- Carbonation and the bitterness of the hops is an enjoyable experience. Feels light, but substantial enough for the style.  D- Very drinkable.

140,276,nomomentwasted,3.71,"Had this on-tap at an airport bar in San Francisco, on my way back to Portland for a spell. Served into a pint glass at about 50 degrees.  Appearance: Brownish-amber color, darker than I'd have predicted a Pale Ale to be. I've had this beer a few times in passing, but upon the reviewing of other Pale Ales, this is darker than many of its kind. Carbonated well as well, with a wavy lacing.  Smell: Slightly metallic, I think the taps had been recently changed and not flushed all that well, but grassy, piny hops with a very present malty texture of slight barley. Hops are understated, with the malt character taking center-stage with almost a bready-ness to it all.  Taste: Much like the smell. Understated hops slightly cover a more malty and bready pale ale. Really not that bitter up front at all, and drinks with a very straight-forward taste that really doesn't evolve beyond slight pine and malty backbone, even as it warms up.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and carbonated enough, but little bitterness and light flavors add up to just a simple, non-lingering aftertaste.  Drinkability: Well, at 5.6%, it's drinkable, but also kind of dull and not too great and the alcohol is actually more present than I've had in a few beers almost double its ABV. I've had it better in the past, but the flavors are just a little too mild for my mood and wanted just a tad more from it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Head can be reconstituted with a gentle swirl.  The nose is a balance of subtle grapefruit and apple slice with gentle biscuit malt, and a slight hoppy resin. Flavor is well-balanced, with bitterness offset by gentle malt which is boosted by the smooth mouthfeel. As this pale ale warms, the bitterness subsides leaving the smooth, relatively thick mouthfeel (for a pale ale) in memory. Very balanced, drinkable pale ale, which has become a staple to keep in stock for myself and to share with visitors who may or may not be craft brew drinkers.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Lots of bubbles stuck to the glass raising up to the finger and a half white head which leaves messy broken lacing.  Citrus is apparent in the nose upfront and a tad bit of earth. Nothing special.  First sip is always a ""man this is a good beer"" taste. Yes thats a taste characteristic now. Really hoppy for a simple Pale Ale. Almost a lemony hop with an earthy backbone...really nice flavor here. The citrus works so well. Really well balanced.  Mouthfeel is great. Nice and crisp with perfect carbonation.

Elegantly decorated bottle.  Pours into my pint glass with a small white head and no lacing. Its a nice amber in color, sorta bloody piss like color. I wish bloody piss didn't look like this because it's a nice looking beer, with some bubbles continuously floating to the top.  Smell is a bit pedestrian, has some floral citrus hop. A little bit of sweet malt too.  Taste has a nice hoppy bite to it, but not without some sweeter, bready malt. Has a creamier mouthfeel, not enough carbonation though. Its decently balanced.

The creamy mouthfeel is the best I've found yet in a session beer. Can't go wrong with this one.

Hops are not so strong like an IPA but come together well with staunch malts and a pine tinge and cover the entire palate. It's the flavor that makes this beer so drinkable, it's not convoluted or disproportionate rather it's incisive.  It's a light carbonation that gives room, in a complimentary way.

Love them cascade hops. One of my gateway craft beers, and still one of my favorites.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,david18,4.62,"This pale ale is the ultimate for its style and can be best appreciated after laying off hoppier beers for a while.

The beer is a light orange that shows plenty of carbonation.  The smell is the weakest part of this beer. Unlike a lot of pale ales, the malt doesn't come thru.  However, the hops come smashing thru as the beer is drank. I really like the hoppy taste, but I would like a little more malt to my ale.  Very drinkable beer, that turns into a six pack really quick.

T-Too bitter for an APA, but the malt presence became more noticeable as it warmed.  M-Very smooth but not quite enough malt presence.  D-A good APA, somewhat overrated in my opinion.

S - A kind of boozy gasoline undertone comes up at first, but quickly is overtaken by the citrus and pine of the hops, faint notes of malt also in the background.  T - Crisp, bitingly hoppy at first, but had enough malt and fresh grainy taste to mellow the bitterness out. Finishes with a little bit of bitterness, bu not nearly enough to be unpleasant.  M - Fairly watery, but not limp. Carbonation is active and adds good amount of levity.  D - The ABV is slightly higher than the norm, but this is a easy drinker. Definitely a session-worthy one, just be a tad careful with it.  Overall - A nice hoppy brew with a workhorse feel. Definitely destined to be a regular in my fridge.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Sticky lace drapes all the way down leaving a few rings. The color is a glowing orangish copper with some golden tones. Mostly transparent with a bit of chill haze.  Aroma is kind of subdued with citrus notes and plenty of malty sweetness.  Taste upfront is orange peels, hops are mild but present upfront. Becoming increasingly bitter through the swallow, lingering with bitter pine. Carbonation tickle throughout.

140,276,hossua34,4.2,"I'll start off by saying that I have been of legal drinking age for nearly two years now, and the other day was the first time I've ever had a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. I waited way, way too long... Serving type: 24 oz. glass bottle.  Appearance is the standard golden beer color, for a lack of better words. Pretty much clear, though the last portion of the bottle added a slight cloudiness to my glass. A big, thick head gradually dissipates to a thin layer of foam. Lots of lacing.  Smell has a decent hops note up front, but it is not at all overpowering. Malt sweetness is also detectable; very well-balanced. Citrus notes, including grapefruit and pineapple, are present.  I am not a big pale ale fan, and I generally dislike IPAs and anything too hoppy. But I LOVE the way this beer tastes. Enough carmally goodness to balance the bitterness of the hops, which are clearly detectable. Floral tasting with slight spice. Aftertase is sweet, hoppy-piney and delicious.  Mouthfeel is slightly watery, and the carbonation left my bottle kind of quickly (the half I poured and drank second).  Drinkability is right on the money. I had no problems easily polishing off my 24 ouncer, with plenty of room to spare. Not tedious to drink, which was my fear going into the bottle, as I don't like a lot of hops.  In reflection, this may be my new standby brand for times when I don't have a great selection to choose from (displacing Sam Adams Boston Lager). I despise hoppy beers and this was a pale ale that won me over. A very well-balanced, drinkable and flavorful brew, and a pioneer brand in American microbrewing to top it all off.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,mwa423,3.68,"Upon realizing that out of the many beers I have rated, I have never looked critically upon the famed SNPA. So, picked up a bomber from the store around the corner.  A - Poured a good two fingers of frothy white head, the beer as it is poured looks like it is out of a beer commercial, lots of bubbles floating to the top, hazy straw color and the perfect mix of clear and watery.  S - Crisp slight hops, little else, very easy on the nose.  T - Very slight citrusy hops hit the tongue immediately. Not like the grapefruit type of citrus but more of a lemon/lime zest from the hops. It is followed quickly by malty sweetness, when you swallow another burst of the limey hops hit the tongue.  This is a real easy drinker and with its wide distribution it is a go to for when the options are this and BMC.

With upwards of 1500 other reviews of the beer, there isn't much left to say beyond what already has been said. The beer pours a nice golden slightly copper color with a smallish but creamy white head, okay retention, some lacing too. The nose is very subtle, some leafy hop a touch of floral, maybe an earth aroma, but not much going on surprisingly.  The taste is very easy to drink. There are definite leafy hops, nothing too resinous or too oily or too nouvelle here, just solid and honest leafy hop. There is enough bready malts and a biscuity backbone to balance out the hop to make it very complementary. There are some drying notes, some sharper citrusy spice flavors in the beer too, maybe a slight touch of clove. The beer is drier than I remember, the mouthfeel is quite mild, there is a lingering hoppy dryness in the aftertaste. This is medium bodied, not too thick, not cloying, very refreshing, very solid. There may be a touch of orange rind lurking underneath as well. This is a very nice Pale Ale, very enjoyable. L'Chaim.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,stevenseg,3.95,"I doubt anyone is here checking out beers at beeradvocate.com having not ever tasted a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. My beverage-loving buddies and I agree that Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is the gateway to more robust flavored beers. Considered a session, this Pale Ale from Chico, California is one of the biggest small-batch breweries in the nation. I honestly had only had the Pale Ale out of a bottle, and I was pleasantly surprised to find it on tap at MyBar, a little strip-mall joint just east of Sawmill Road on Rt. 161 in Dublin, Ohio (shout out to my hometown).  My brew was delivered as a full pint. As it is when I pour it at home, the color was a clear amber with a nice fluffy head, which dissipated after a few minutes into a nice sticky film with great lacing. I love lacing rings (rings of lacing that stick to the glass, which are visible after every drink) and I am always very careful as I drink to drink out of the same side of the glass to be sure to preserve them. SN's Pale Ale is so sticky that the rings are barely visible and the lacing coats the entire inside of the glass. A rarity and a testament to the density of the beer.  The nose of this pale ale had very little of that sweet maltiness. Instead it's very hoppy. If I can smell bitterness, it's bitter. Flowery, but my nose translates the smell of flowery hops to bitter, because that's what is coming.  I think Sierra Nevada calls this a pale ale so as not to scare off the newbies. This is a session beer after all and IPA's aren't typically sessions, but by all intents and purposes, the SN pale ale might as well be an IPA. It's subtle sweetness is no match for the dryness on the back end. This beer is all hops, which is a great trait for a session. The bitterness on the back end lingers pleasantly into the next sip.  SN's Pale Ale is a little syrupy. It's very thick and I could feel it on my lips. It's carbonation is done very well for a mass-produced beer. It is not creamy like and English Ale, nor is it a carbonated mess like American lagers. Instead it has a great consistency, much like a good IPA, and it surely doesn't taste cheap for being available at most supermarkets.  When I find a bar that serves Sierra Nevada, I'm a happy camper. I can slug down Guinness all night, but Sierra Nevada is a slow-sipping delicacy, a sipable evening treat.  The Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is a session beer for craft brew lovers. It's one of the hoppiest commercially available beers on the market, and that's what distinguishes it in my mind. If you are a Pale Ale lover, it's just a matter of time before you're tipping back on thicker IPA's and porters.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,boatshoes,3.6,"Picked up a sixer at the Jersey shore after dinner to spend a relaxing evening. Not my first experience with this beer but my first time intent upon a review.  Appearance- Two and a half fingers of orange tinted head that is puffy and pillowly with big bubbles off of a not particularly aggressive pour. About a fourth finger of head retains as I drink, with a small amount of lacing down the side of the glass as well. The beer itself is a very nice copper orange with a solid amount of carbonation that beads up the side of the glass. Very solid looking pale ale.  Smell- A fairly simple but pleasurabe nose of citrusy hops in foreground. Lots of lemon zest and grapefruit/orange peel coming through with the hops. A bit of graininess/malt backbone detectable as well but not nearly as present as the hop profile.  Taste- Very mild beer with lemony, citrusy hops up front and a nice malt backbone to balance out the bitterness. Not terribly complex but a solid balance of bittering hops and malt backbone that makes this a very flavorful and easy drinking beer. Ends with a bit of a hop punch at the end that is nice and crisp and leaves you going back for more.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- A solidly balanced level of carbonation and body for a pale ale. Fairly heavily carbonated but not offensively so. The hop punch and dryness of the beer keeps you coming back and leaves this beer gone before you know it. Very sessionable.  Overall, a great beer to use to introduce your macro friends to craft and a solid staple to fall back on if you need a relatively cheap and sessionable craft brew. Unlikely I'll keep this a staple in the fridge, but certainly wouldn't pass it up if offered.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

From yeast and protein coagulations consisting of B12 vitamins. This is normal because its a bottle conditioned beer usuing the purest ingredients.  The smell is more hoppy than i expected. Pine and slight citrus. Not a grapefruit type of citrus though. But at the same time lots of caramel.  Taste floral and piney hops, balanced well with malts. Lip smacking good.

I have become a huge fan of the Torpedo and I wanted to branch out and see what else they offered. I am not a huge fan of Pale Ales but this is a good tasting beer. For better or worse I have become a huge hop fan, therefore the hoppier the beer the better, but this is just as good as any of those hop bombs. I see this beer alot when I go out to chain restaurants and I am excited to now have another beverage option when I eat at those places. This will make it into my regular rotation when I need a break from the stronger presence beers.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,brokensail,4.1,"A: The pour is a hazy golden-orange color with some lively carbonation and a fluffy white head.  S: While there is certainly a caramel malt sweetness, this pale ale has a very pronounced citrus and pine hoppiness to it.  T: Up front, this has nice citrus hops with the malt taking the lead through the middle before the piney, bitter finish.  M: The body is medium with a lively carbonation which makes this a nice refreshing pale ale.  D: My fist craft beer and always a standby when out at a bar or restaurant. You can almost never go wrong with SNPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,qpHalcy0n,4.3,"Served chilled into Pilsner glass.  Pours ambery/orange with perhaps some greenish hue at glancing angles with a 1 finger head. Moderate lacing.  Malt aroma hits first followed by hops and grapefruit and almost gingery smell.  Extremely earthy taste. Bitter citrus fruits like grapefruit hit first and finishes with a piney/gingery taste. A very refreshing beer, especially on a hot 100 degree Texas summer.  It's got a little bit more bite to it than I'd like, but the excellent taste/finish overcomes this for me. Moderate carbonation.  This is a very earthy beer that is very refreshing to drink. I haven't tried many Sierra Nevada beers but I'm looking forward to more. Makes for a wonderful summer beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,drums4matt,3.82,"Picked this up - as I often do - on a hot day after making some moves on a Summer-like day.  Poured almost totally clear (other than perhaps a little chill haze) from the bottle into a Scaldis tulip. Looks nice; it pours a typical, goldenrod ale color with a one-finger, white, slightly fizzy head that only remained for a moment. Minor, though quite pretty, lacing is left around the apex of the glass.  Smell has significantly less to offer than other ""micros"" right off the bat, but after sipping one slowly and allowing for some warming-up this beer really shows its colors. There's a sweet graininess right out front with some west-coast hops just peeking their way through the soft, fragrant bouquet. Mmm. That smell sits SO nice with a hot afternoon.  The taste is nice. It offers more than the aroma would let onto. There's some nice fruity flavors right out front - tastes like a combination of the malted grains and phenoly, almost vinous, flavors. Delicate hops leave a lasting impression of floral and slightly citrusy flavor with a palate-coating oiliness.  Sierra Nevada is one of the beers that turned me onto beer. It has such well-defined characteristics - it nearly defines (or possibly ACTUALLY defines) the style of American Pale Ale. The refreshing drinkability (and not in the Miller Lite sense, either) meshes so well with the malt and hop to yield something that has become a classic.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Brencr,4,"It seems that with Sierra Nevada, you really can not go wrong. The same can be said for their Pale Ale. Clear, no sedament (not that I mind that) and good taste.

In MD we call the ""Blue Laws"", the county I live in just allowed stores to be open until 4 or 6 pm, but there are times when living on a county line has its benifits.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Clydesdale,4,"A: Pours a faintly hazy golden-orange color with some visible carbonation. The thick, fluffy head has a similar golden hint, becoming rocky as it slowly fades. A nice smattering of lacing trails along the sides of the glass.  S: Some pale and biscuity malt aroma, followed by refreshingly fruity notes of peaches. The hops recall orange oil and pine sap. There is a bit of a mineral character as well.  T: Pale and biscuity malt flavor predominates up front. Orange oil and some pithy grapefruit bitterness come from the hops up front, followed by a moderately piney flavor into the finish. A mineral hint into the finish, along with a second wave of biscuity malt.  M: A soft body just on the light side of medium. Mild, tingly carbonation, with a measured dryness into the finish.  D: I'm almost embarrassed to say I haven't ever sat down to enjoy one of these beers before. Odd for something so widely respected and distributed.

I'm glad to have a relatively fresh one to review, as the last one of these I had was really lacking in hop aroma. A little malty sweetness is in there, but for the most part it's just nice clean, citrusy, American hops.  T: Slightly bitter, great hop flavor, lots of grapefruit. Kind of a bready malt note to it.  M: Excellent carbonation, medium body.

M: Perfect amount of carbonation. Great mouthfeel.  D: Decent drinkability. A little too expensive to be a session beer for me though.

There is a full hop aftertaste that is very pleasant. This is a very hoppy pale ale. The body is moderately light and there is some sharp carbonation in the mouthfeel.

The latest SNPA case I bought this last week fits into the ""not so much love"" category. Here's the review for the bottle, and I'll review it on tap in the near future.  A: Big white frothy, creamy head over a slightly hazy golden. Super sticky lacing and some frothy retention. S: Toasted malts, fresh grains, some metallic, and a hop aroma that is really trying to push through but can't quite make it over the malts. T: A few more hops on the tongue than the nose would have me believe. A bit piney and herbal, but that fades quickly and the taste turns into a wet grainy and slightly skunked character. Some woodiness in there. M: Light-bodied with medium carbonation. D: This baby is lacking in the flavor I know and love. The bottle just doesn't do this brew justice.

S- Smells like high quality hops to me, not much else prominent.  T- Tastes like heaven. Starts off sweet and hoppy, simplistic and perfect. Then the flavor of hops rolls along the tongue and lingers for a bit, but not overly intense.  M- Lightly carbonated and incredibly smooth leading to a high level of drinkability.  D- Very sessionable. Drank a sixer before bed and it went down easier than water. Woke up and drank one at room temperature, and it was equally delicious. Not many beers can pull that off.

Not sure if that was the type used, it just really reminded me of smelling cascade hops at the homebrew store. Excellent job of showcasing hop potential.  T- Starts of with some hopiness (go figure), then some mild sweetness from the light malts, and then some hop bitterness as a clean finisher.  M- Medium carbonation with a light mouthfeel  D- This has become one of my favorite summertime beers. Not quite as refreshing as some hefewiezens that I've had, gut it's definitely high on the list of thirst quenchers (gatorade is for pussies!).

I got this as a 24 ounce bottle so it's a bit much for me to drink at one time but I find myself getting through the whole bottle pretty easily.  I poured half into a glass and liked what i saw. A nice head about 1.5"", white dense and foamy and collapsing into a lace when i got half way through the glass.  The smell was...like a beer but smelled like a good beer meaning it didnt smell weak, it smelled like a beer with something in it. I picked up a hoppy smell.  The taste is...wow. It's a balancing act between malt and hops with hops winning by a nose. The taste is good and not weak at all, when you drink it you get to taste this. Kind of citrusy, must be the hops talking to me.  Mouthfeel is good, not watery but i was expecting that. Maybe it's the carbonation? I'm sure that is helping it some but it just doesnt seem watery to me.  Aftertaste is mild, you know you drank a beer but doesnt leave a bad taste in your mouth. It almost leaves you wanting more.

A little murky through the glass. The one finger head quickly unfolds. There is a bit of lacing, however.  There is a sweetness to the scent of this beer with a prominent fruity lime aroma. A floral or pine note lingers in the mix. You can smell some of the grain but it is not overpowering.  SNPA comes in a little like an unfiltered wheat and leaves like a proper pale ale. This drink starts out sweet with those citrus notes and some quiet floral/pine. The hops kick in mid-palate, giving you a chance to appreciate boldness of their flavor. To me, the hop dominates the flavor of this brew even with the initial sweetness and what it lacks in depth in overcomes in quality.  Crisp is the one term that really defines this beer. When you combine the flavor with a medium-to-light body and almost ticklish carbonation you get a very sharp and dry beer. Not a filling beer in any sense.

Not perfect, because after drinking for a bit, the scent begins to resemble that wet hop/wet dog smell that I know some like, but I do not.  T: Again, simple hoppiness, maybe tending towards piney. A smooth malty aftertaste makes a cameo appearence, but the hops are the defininf character of this brew.The taste really sticks to the top of the mouth. It has a funny sort of bitter that I'm not sure sure I'm a fan of though.  M: Mine is very cold, it's nice. Slightly biting, but warming. Light bodied but still forceful and very much present on the tongue. I will give it a four for mouth and four.five for drinkability, but I would rather do four.two five for both. Can you tell my numbers aren't working?  D: Very refreshing and not at all offensive.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,yemenmocha,4.28,"Pours luminous amber with hint of gold and thick white head. Nose is fresh with citrus hops, and some pine.

You get a nice hit of hops but not to much then a nice caramel like malt ending with a slight bitterness.... Very nice Pale Ale...  M: Med bodied, smooth but nicely hopped bitterness.

140,276,kaseydad,3.87,"Ahhh an old friend who got me into the craft world. Unfortunately I no longer ""visit"" my friend very often.  Reviewing this from a tap on a big 22 oz. pour. It appears with a small foamy head which quickly dissolves on top of an amber red/caramal color.  Smells hoppy and also tastes hoppy with a major malt backbone to try to smooth it out.  Easy drinkability allows for multiple bottles or glasses at a seating.  Unfortunately this beer doesn't do it for me anymore. The fact that is available almost everywhere is a plus, but I tend to avoid it now...though I love some of the other SN products.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Plenty of visible carbonation. Very good lacing.  Smell: Smells of grain and bready malts. A sharp bitter nose, but with very little hops at all.  Taste: A mild beer with a good balance between the grainy malts and the light hops. No one taste really dominates. A good ""standard"" of the style, memorable for its simplicity.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, and very smooth. Good crisp and clean finish.  Drinkability: A very good pale ale. Very simple without one real defining quality, but a true standard of the type.

140,276,Rhynes2,3.66,"Took a few tries to get into this beer to be honest. Clear, light colored beer when poured out. Little head retention. Very citrusy in flavor. I am normally a fan of the grapefruit flavor in a beer but this beer was a bit too sour for my tastes. Aftertaste is a bit too unpleasant. I really liked the bottle condition aspect here.

Juicy citrus smell with faint sour notes.  T: Citrus flavors up front, some lemon, lime, grapefruit. Faint toastiness from the malts. Hop bitterness brings out the grapefruit flavor I'm getting. Slight astringency, finishes a little tart/sour.  M: A little fizzy on the tongue, body is a bit thin.  D: A lot of bright citrus flavors.

140,276,mullenite,4.28,"Poured a clear orange with a two finger frothy white head that stuck to the glass like nothing else and left a nice cap on the top of the beer and a thicker ring around the glass.  Smell is a combination of grapefruit and fresh cut grass with grapefruit winning out overall. The scent is not overly bitter however, compared to some other hoppy pale ales and balanced ipas this is subdued.  Right off the bat and on the tip of the tongue is an excellent biscuit malt flavor followed immediately by the citrus hops. Towards the back of the tongue the biscuit shows itself again this time with a much more pine flavored bitterness that lingers for some time.  A solid medium body with a great cleansing carbonation that keeps the long finish from being too sticky.  This one is very easy for ME to drink, for a beginner it might be too much but probably a great introduction to hops.  This has been a bar standard for me for a while, bottle or tap it's a great go-to beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Bockrules,4.38,"Poured from a 24oz bottle into a Weizen glass  A - Pours a huge, fluffy, off-white head. Nice Dark gold to bronze color. Very nice head retention - stays intact all the way down the glass. Leaves behind good lacing.  S - Very balanced smell of cascade hops and sweet malt. Some hints of orange and spice. Quite nice, but could stand to be a tad more potent.  T - Orange flavor and hops dominate upfront. The body is incredibly balanced; the sweet malt and hops are in perfect harmony and the orange flavor and spice play over the top to give a very rich and delicious taste. The finish tastes like an orange creamsickle and slowly the hops kick in to leave a bitter-orange aftertaste. Very Delicious!  M - Moderate to high carbonation, and medium bodied. This beer also has a very creamy mouthfeel to it, which is unusual among APAs, but suit this beer extremely well.  D - This beer is one of the classic example of a stellar APA and for good reason. The brew is incredibly balanced, but has enough hop flavor to satisfy pale ale fans. The subtle and yet complex flavors coupled with a truly unique and incredible mouthfeel make this beer the benchmark for all other APAs. I will definitely purchase this beer again in the near future.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Blakaeris,3.6,"Pours golden-amber with a thick creamy white head that leaves plenty of lacing.  Aroma is grassy, floral and citrus hop and grainy malt.  Taste is crisp and clean. Nice bit of grapefruit hop. Grainy caramel malt backbone keeps everything in balance. Lemon grass and fruity citrus character lingers throughout. Finish is crisp and dry with resinous pine and spicy hop.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied.  A very drinkable APA that is accessible even to those not yet initiated to the wonderful world of hops. Overall flavor is mild but crisp enough to keep things interesting. A great session beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Taste and Mouth is ridiculously hoppy, Ver crisp and refreshing.Nice carbonation,a little tingle on the tongue. Light to medium bodied as well.  Drink is very good. Easy to put down a few. I usually don't like hoppy beers but this is very smooth and not a dry and bitter as others.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,infi,4.3,"Poured into a pint.  Pours a translucent golden orange color with a generous amount of bubbling occurring throughout the glass, which forms a white head of extra fine bubbles forming and settling to a thin cap that moves away from the center of the glass and towards the perimeter. From a birds-eye view, it's appears to be a white ring with some thin patches of bubbles scattered in the middle. The smell is incredible with its floral bouquet of spicy hops, pine, citrus, honey and slight amounts of malt and yeast. Extra whiffs indicate that the aromas are more citrus-oriented than the pine, kinda like cutting into a fresh grapefruit. This is one damn good smelling beer.  The taste, at first, is very sweet from the malts and honey. Then, the pine and citrus come into play as they present themselves as a slight dry bitterness. And towards the end, I can taste the pith of grapefruit and a hoppy spiciness, which leaves a nice crisp and dry aftertaste. There is a definite earthy characteristic in the flavor profile - it's excellent.  This pale ale has a medium-bodied mouthfeel with adequate amount of carbonation in the mouth. And as aforementioned, a crisp and dry aftertaste remains on the tongue and inner linings of the cheeks, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Drinkability is very high. You won't notice how fast you'll be drinking it. It is remarkably sessionable, tasty and reliable. SNPA will always be one of my go-to beers.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,jdubjacket,4.17,"Ah, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. A staple for me at gas stations, crappy bars and restaurants. Pours a transparent golden color. Completely see-through.

Overall, this is a great stand-by brew for any occasion.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Definitely, a nice refreshing brew out of California. Smell is somewhat lacking for an american pale ale, but I guess I was spoiled by Three Floyds Alpha King (my go-to american pale ale). I had heard and read great things about this Sierra Nevada offering, but I don't find it lives up to the hype, though still a very good beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

T - The front is a charcoal/hop bitterness, not for long, but it's there. Soon after is the sweet caramel taste followed by some lemony citrus.  M - It's a bit syryupy but drys in the end leaving the mouth a tad bit coated, but eventually drys out, either way the taste lingers a bit.  D - Very drinkable.

The citrusy pine rolls around the tongue nicely.

Taste: This is a very well balanced beer with a somewhat hoppy taste followed by malt and really is similar to the smell. It does have a slightly bitter after taste  Mouthfeel: This has some light carbonation, however it is a very smooth beer. It really coats the mouth nicely creating a somewhat chewy feel. It is not really thin bodied but is a little less than medium bodied.  Drinkability: Its light-medium body gives it a lot of drinkability and its none massive abv makes a session beer in my book. It is not a special beer, due to it being so common, but I it is one of my go to beers and is typically in my fridge.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,remmyreel,4.1,"Was at Harry's Bar in SF today and noticed they had it on tap, so I gave it a try.  It's definitely better on tap than from a bottle. It has a darker amber color to it, which was a little unexpected. And per previous reviews, it does have a malty feel to it, certain to produce a bit of phlegm at the back of the throat.  It's not a beer I get too often, because of the maltiness and lack of refreshment I get from it.

Nice frothy white head with lots of bubbles errupting up top. Diagonal bubbles floating off the sides of the glass. Some lacing and the head dies down after a little bit. Lookin good.  Nose of sweet cascade and vienna malt. Sort of a pilsner like, clean aroma. Slightly soapy, but I'm going to go ahead and blame my glass on that one.  Taste is a lot maltier than I remember.. hints at oktoberfests or vienna lagers. I almost wish there was more of a cascade bite to it to balance out the malt, but it's otherwise perfect.  Very smooth mouthfeel. I have close to no problems with it whatsoever. Carbonation is prickly and pleasant. I can see why this beer has been around for so long and enjoyed by so many people.

The taste starts off with some sweet bready malt that gives way to some floral spicy hops and some malt comes back for the finish. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with some moderate carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer, and probably one of the most popular beers in the style for a reason.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Ragingbull,3,"This beer is another one that I would put on the ""tough to review"" list because of its familiarity. I had been drinking this long before a wide variety of microbrews became available likely due its wide distribution. Here is my attempt.  Rich roasted gold color with light head and some prickle. Mildly hoppy nose. Hops forward flavor and almost a hoppy attack. I am guessing the nose affects the initial attack as the smells from the glass impact the flavor. It stays hoppy through the finish but in a mild way. The aftertaste allows the hops to fade with a bubbly mouthfeel that dries and vanishes. My wife offered the comment that the aftertaste made her feel as if she had just licked an envelope. This beer is certainly one to throw in the cooler for a backyard BBQ, but it isn't likely one that I will keep on hand in my beer fridge. I think that I find myself lumping into the ""old standards"" by which everything else is judged and would have to call it average for that very purpose. There are going to be better beers and far worse beers. If you have nothing else to choose from you won't be disappointed, but if there is something else on the menu you haven't tried its probably worth trying the new beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Good, but weaker than I'd like.  3.5 T: Pretty good. This was right on the verge of earning a 4.0. Again, there's a subtle though pleasant citrusy taste. A bit of spiciness to it as well.

This beer is a very good beer, widely available, and the brewery from which it is birthed has never once disappointed me. It has a very nice craft feel, and is particularly well balanced for a beer this readily available. A point not a lot of people touched on is the bottle fermentation... and this adds a depth of carbonation that a lot of other mass produced beers dont have. A very nice example of the style.

A slight aggressive pour creating a 2 finger slight off-white head. Leaves some thin splattered lacing. Color is a clear golden orange. You can see perfectly through this beer and the carbonation bubbles had my eyes mesmerized.  Aroma: first thing I thought of was fruity pebbles, but in a good way. Earthy hops. Bready malts. Not to much here, but really good for a pale ale (it has a better aroma then some IPAs).  Taste is hoppy of course. Very balanced with malts though (no types to distinguished for me). Has some citrus notes as well. Great pale ale!  Mouthfeel is bitter at first, but then becomes very enjoyable (not saying that the bitter isn't). Leaves a chewy, hoppy aftertaste.  This beer is definitely a classic and something I will always buy. It is by far one of the better tasting pale ales around. I highly recommend this beer if you haven't tried it yet.

There is also a piney note from the hops. The taste is balanced with both the hops and malt coming through. The pine flavor from the hops definitely seems to be a signature of Sierra Nevada. The flavor is well balanced for a pale ale. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and crisp for the slight carbonation. Drinkability is good as the ABV is low and flavors work well for a session brew.

Sierra's trademark hoppiness definitely resonates in this beer as does some citric acid. Doesn't linger around a whole lot, and finishes crisp.  M: Medium, carbonation has an opening strength that backs off slowly and pleasantly.  D: Perhaps the scariest part of this beer, a sessionable for sure and one I would never turn down.

Some light lace stuck on the glass but barely.  S- A nice hop aroma from various strains giving off a floral aroma. I can smell a citrus a roma plus some malt leading its way to slight caramel. Very nice and pungent.  T- Was not expecting all the hops plus bitterness for a pale ale but this does fit the style. It's not overdone, it's just balanced. The malt gives off caramel at just the right time without interfering. In the finish is some toasted grain plus a bit of spice.  M- A step above medium bodied and oily. The bitterness is there but does not overcome. The malt addition works well in this nicely hopped pale ale. Creamy going down and a nice finish.  D- Good stuff, drinkable plus affordable, this one is a good package. Better off of the tap but fresh bottles are good as well. Low alcohol too which is also a plus.

Pours a medium honey with a soapy one finger head that dissipates quickly and laces the sides of the glass. Clarity is impressive given that there is supposed to be sediment in there.  Aroma is soapy hops and light malt. Hop aroma is slightly astringent and mild. Smallish caramel aroma is barely detectable.  Taste is lightly roasted malt on the front. Sweet and smooth the malt is good but could stand up a bit more. Hops in the middle are soapy and astringent. Bright flavors from the hops mute the malt slightly.

140,276,Jimbo87,4,"In a U.S. pint glass.  Clear yellow orange amber, offwhite head.  Smell: Malt, sweetness, but some hops too. Pine boards.  Taste: Barley, grapefruit, lemon. Kind of bitter. Again, a freshly cut pine board.  MF is good. Pretty carbonated. Sort of foams in your mouth at the end.  D: very drinkable. A very good/excellent beer, for the style at least. I don't tend to be blown away by pale ales, but I do like to drink this one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,ocelot2500,4.3,"Pours a clear copper color with a nice white head. More than enough lacing on the glass.  Smells of some floral hops and malt. Nothing overwhelming, but everything balanced.  Tastes of the floral hops with the malt backbone. The malt provides a slightly sweet counterpoint to the hops and makes for one really balanced brew.  The mouthfeel is nice and crisp. There is an appropriate amount of carbonation.  This is very drinkable. No wonder this is the flagship brew for Sierra Nevada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,WalrusJockey,3.98,"12oz bottle into Duvel tulip.  A- clear, bright, sunset golden-orange. Light, though, not dark. Head is slightly sandy off-white, and about a finger tall, after settling in.  S- American hops, with a backing of malt, pretty much exactly what you would expect. Emphasis is on the hops, but it is fairly balanced aroma. Nice, but unexceptional.  T- sweet malt flows in and settles around the place, to be followed by a savory, fruity hops flavor, which is much more fruity than bitter. Swallow is hoppy, but still fruity, and the combined grassy-bitter-fruity flavor persists a short time as a mild aftertaste. Very solid, exactly what you picture with an APA.  M- light, crisp, but fruity and smooth. Not watery at all, just enough body to be present, without being heavy, cloying, or thin.  D- good. Very good. Great with almost any food type, or almost any occasion. All around a drinkable beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,JohnQVegas,4.11,"Bottle into Sam Adams lager glass.  Pours a clear coppery gold, effervescent, with a nice one finger white head that slowly settles into a creamy white cap. Some beautiful lacing as well. Nothing spectacular, but it does all the little things just right.  Nose is nicely floral, with some soft, biscuity malt behind.  Taste follows suit - perfectly balanced, with a floral hop presence, plenty of nice citrus, and a beautiful, biscuity, lightly sweet pale malt body. Finish is nice and very lightly bitter, with a strong lingering biscuity malt exhale.  Mouthfeel is moderate in all respects - just feels right. Very nicely done.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,laituegonflable,3.79,"Slightly copper-tinged brown colour, very thin bead of carbonation occurring at 90° intervals around the glass. Very thin head when poured, none now. Leaves a thin web of lacing. Not bad but not GREAT.  Smells, yup, like Little Creatures. Dominant hoppiness with a generous sherbety pineapple character to it. Might need warming up but anyhow it's a pleasant, fresh kind of nose.  Isn't that interesting. Good complex flowering palate. Fairly strong hit of hops on the front, settles out into a sweet malty but subtle back palate with blended elements of guava and pineapple, with the slightest caramel hit. There are very nice flavours but it's dominated by the hoppy front palate which is the standout flavour.  I'm told that when Americans taste Little Creatures they say it's like Sierra Nevada but not as good. I have to say that cuts both ways. This is a very pleasant drop, but I do think Little Creatures has a bit more character and more complex flavours. If I were born across the Pacific though I'd be perfectly prepared to say the opposite :)",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,bsend,4.1,"Poured a 12 oz. bottle bottle into a standard pint glass.  The beer pours a nice golden orange color. Light carbonation rises into the glass to a nice 1 finger white head.  The aroma is strong with hops. For a pale ale, we see lots of wonderful hop aroma.  The taste is definitely a decent pale ale. A great hop flavor for the hop head who wants a lighter brew.  The mouth feel was decent. Beer is a little on the dry side, but certainly nothing that affects it from being enjoyable.  The drinkability is definitely there. This is one of the better hop brews to session with. After trying this one, you will probably start working this one into your rotation of usual suspects.  Final Thoughts - Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is a popular brew. If you haven't tried it, do it!

D - Very sessionable beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Darker than other pale ales I've had. The aroma is mildly hoppy and sweet with some citrus in there as well. Not an overpowering aroma but nicely balanced. The taste is well balanced and follows the nose: Mildly hoppy and citrusy. I taste orange and pine, but it's a gentle taste. A little bitterness comes through after swallowing. Mouthfeel is somewhat dry and light/medium bodied. This could be my favorite session beer. Very drinkable and I could drink them all day. So, so good.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,IMincedTheKing,3.76,"Pours a pretty amber with a nice white head.  The nose is bold and hoppy with a good amount of grapefruit rind.  Well-balanced malts and hop bitterness. The grapefruit character is present but doesn't overwhelm the beer. The medium body and modest carbonation make this pleasant enough to drink.  Overall, I don't find it very compelling, but by no means is it bad, and I definitely wouldn't turn one down.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,LordAdmNelson,3.98,"A- Pours orangey-golden-tan with about an inch and a half of white head. Very nice retention.  S- Hoppy aroma--mainly citrusy hops. Simple, but good.  T- Starts with a sweet malt, grainy, drifts into citrus hops. Grapefruit... very well balanced.  M- Slight prickle from the hops and carbonation. Slick, clean finish.  D- I could have a twelve tonight. I know this is technically outside the range of session beers, but this would definitely be a session APA for me and I would love it.  Overall, very nicely balanced. Hoppy, but malty... delicious. SN makes great stuff.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,RoadLizard,4.57,"Orange-ish color with a fairly chunky head and decent lacing. This beer smelled very good to me. Lively floral odors. Yum.  Excellent ""upfront"" hop-bite that becomes calming as it goes down. Slight maltiness at the end of the swig mixed with a little orange peel bitterness for some complexity. This is a beer that happens to be very drinkable & pleasant.  Packs a decent alcohol punch so enjoy it in moderation :)  Simply a GREAT Pale Ale!!!!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,OzarkElmo,3.88,"From bottle to tulip 03/21/2009. First taste of a legendary micro brew. Pours a slightly hazy orang/golden color. Moderate off-white head with decent lacing through finish. Aroma of cascade hops, citrus, and malts. Well-balanced beer with a good dry finish. Good representation of an APA. I kind of like a beer closer to home a bit better - Schlafly's APA. To me either one is good for a six-pack session with friends. Cheers!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Rainne,4.44,"Got my start on APA's and this one is a classic. Had lots of bottles but dare I say I like it even better on tap.  A- Copper orange/red color. Nice head and less retention than the bottle and lacing is very nice. Pretty.  S- Something else comes out on tap. A little earthier maybe? Great balance of hops and orange as well.  T- Likewise. Hops up front and malt balanced with orange and earthy floral notes.  M- Medium body, smooth and dry. Crisper on tap?  D- Super drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,FallinDeck,3.92,I like the dark red/orange red color to it. The floral white head seems to be a little lacy. The slight aroma leaves me wanting a little more.

Hoppy nose with light orange zest, a clean and inviting aroma. Citrus hops taste with wonderful bitter / malt balance and substantial body for the style. This beer simply tastes great. Among the finer pale ales that I've tried, tasty with a nicely blended barley malt finish and an aftertaste that pleases and lingers for quite a long while. I'm sure I've had this and other Sierra Nevada products a few years ago, before I became a BA, and this one is just as I remember all the Sierra Nevada products - far above the norm for quality, taste and cost.

Taste again reveals the hops, a little earthy, a little piney and a faint spicy character. Some grapefruit present in the finish.  Crisp with a medium level of carbonation. Very easy to drink. Still a classic although I think the Torpedo may have ruined this one a bit for me since I basically see that as an amped up SNPA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,Bananaman,4.43,"I've always like this beer on bottle, but on-tap it's a quite different experience (maybe partly for the lower alcoholic content) and I like it!  The beer pours a bright amber color with a huge white head! Looks amazing, you just want to take a deep sip as soon as you have the pint in your hands.  Aroma holds lots of fresh hops! I mean, there is a huge difference between the smell of this one and the botteled one. They both smell good, but this one smells a lot fresher.  Taste is, as expected, very hoppy! Lots of hops, some slightly sweet malts and even more hops. Some slight hint of tropical fruits, probably from the Cascade(?) hops. The only problem I have is that the carbonation is a bit too high, but it doesn't matter when beer tastes this good!  This sure is one of my favourite session-beers!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,joshuadlight,4.13,"So much has been said about this classic. I cannot do much to bring anymore recognition, other than to say that I concur with this beer's position as one of the greats and as the face of a brewery and of craft beer in general. Malty and hoppy, balanced, drinkable, beautiful. Its just one of those beers that a brewer stumbled upon and knew it was going to be legendary. If for some reason you are reading this review and have not enjoyed a SNPA, get out there and try this yourself. It perfectly represents the style and craft beer in general. Awesome beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,grayburn,4.2,"It's crazy to me that I hadn't had this beer before last night...it really is the staple of the craft brew revolution...so it is time for me to pay it some justice. The beer pours a pretty copper with a healthy head on its shoulders that plays well with others for a long time. The smell is a nice balance between pine and citrus hops. Very refreshing smell, not too strong. The taste is the same, just enough flavor, without wearing out the taste buds. This would be an excellent beer to get someone into good brews, as it does not come off strong enough to offend the pallette of even the stoutest macro drinker. The mouthfeel is light, with good carbonation, another factor that really plays well with the beer as a whole. I could drink this beer all the time, it is definitely worth the nametag that it carries, tugging along the burden of the brewer...excellent drinkability and a testament to the return of our barley messiah.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

The head is still quite nice with good retention and lacing is good as well.  The smell has notes of grain but is most strongly of spice and floral hops.  The taste is crisp with a powerful spicy citrus and a strong hops bitterness. There is also a very light touch of sweetness that takes the edge off a little. There's a bready sort of maltiness that kind of hovers just within reach.  The body is medium with a light carbonation. A nicely lingering finish is pretty dry.

Lots of hops in the aroma (american dual-purpose hops, Cascade and maybe even Amarillo comes to mind). Citrus, grapefruit and some light malt  T: Maltier than expected from the smell, but actually very well-balanced! Very smooth and blossomy (if that's even a word), fresh, crisp and light. Maltier at first, but some hop bitterness in the finish (not much bitterness though, mostly flavoring hops). Very refreshing!  M: Light and smooth on the tongue and throat. The CO2 tickles a bit on the palate, really nice :)  D: Absolutely great. Goes down easier than any other ale I've tried. The balance between malt and hops is fantastic and makes this one excellent beer. Both the malt and the hops are easily distinguishable and tasteable individually - really enjoyable!  Conclusion: Outstanding all-round APA with great aroma and flavor hops. Maltier taste at first, but hoppier citrusy, grapefruitish in the finish. Very drinkable and excellent CO2.

140,276,beerogre,4.6,"Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is truly an American icon. Although there are more elaborate beers than this one available across the country, few can demonstrate the level of consistency, claim the enduring drinkability or indeed have the widespread availabilty that SNPA has.  Having just spent the last few days moving house (a sure way to build a thirst if ever there was one) I finally got the opportunity to have a few beers tonight. My fridge is packed with some really great beers from such breweries as Stone, Victory, Brooklyn, Southampton and even some SN Bigfoot, Torpedo and Celebration - but despite my impressive inventory, all I wanted to do was guzzle some SNPA, such is its thirst quenching quality. The thought of SNPA came into my head a few days ago, and I know that when that type of thing happens it's an itch that's not going to go away until it's scratched. So a quick trip to the supermarket soon remedied the situation - and that's one of the real beauties about this beer - it's available practically everywhere.  With its clean, crisp, (look at me I'm stood on top of a mountain and it's so) refreshing taste it really is a beer I could drink until the cows come home.

This is just a fantastic looking beer  S: piney, citrus notes with a good malt backbone to that backs it up with a touch of sweetness  T: More on the bitter side but it has balance as I detected malty sweetness towards the end  M: Medium-body with a dry finish that highlights the hop prfile  D: overall this is a really good APA, definitely put a few of these away... tasty beverage.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,JohnWaynes44,3.86,"Poured a golden orange in to a pint glass. The head is nice, with considerable lacing.  Smell is subtle, slight hint of floral.  Fresh and bright taste. Hops are there but not overwhelming. Malts try to peak through the dry finish.  Mouth is pretty light for the style.  I could and will drink this all day. It is refined enough to compliment fine cuisine and simple enough to drink all day at a ballgame.  I love this beer. It is always consistent. You know you're going to get a good head and it's always fresh. Good value and easy to find (even in rural Indiana). This beer is solid and so is the brewery. Thanks.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Docer,3.8,"Great amber color.. looks like a pale!  Smell its slightly pine and citrus, but not too strong.  Light malt and decent hop notes. Mild citrus and pine. Doesn't taste so grainy like some other sessional pales. No rice or corn there!  Great fishing beer, slightly dry.  A bit more on the bubbly side.. I like a pale that is slightly less carbonated.  A home brew kit I have says SN uses hop pellets to make this one... I don't think it's true.. maybe in the start!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Napone,4.71,"Appearance - golden amber with a nice head. Not 'orangish' like some Pale Ales.  Smell - mild to moderate aroma, not too intense  Taste - great going down with a complex finish  Drinkability - a very drinkable beer, similar to some of the India Pale Ales I've had in the past  Sorry about that lack of technical terms, this is my first ever review.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

S- Nutty malt and piney hops, just what I would expect from a good American Pale Ale. Slightly citrusy and yeasty. Very well rounded.  T- Slightly piney, but it a very good way. Hoppy, a little bitter, but well balanced. one word-delicious.  M- Nice carbonation, has a little bite, which I like, lets you know your drinking it. Medium body.

140,276,ChrisQ,4.47,"Pouring Pale Ale into a glass, one will see an amber liquid with a half inch of bone colored creamy foam that lasts about a minute. The view of looking into the glass gives the viewer thoughts about clarity and character: a brew that isn't hiding anything and can stand up for itself.  Smelling your freshly poured drink reveals a light floral smell that invites you to taste. One's tongue is given a bath in clean flavors with a light bitterness that sticks around until your next sip. Subsequent sips cause the front clean flavors to blend with the initial sharp aftertaste, causing the taste of bitterness to mellow which creates a cooperation of flavors that keeps your mouth from getting bored.  This is definitely a drink that can be enjoyed in multiples due to its building flavors on top of itself, so I look forward to my next trip to the store.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,jczn,4.43,"Poured into a pint glass.  A: Nice, clear medium gold with warmth. Thin white head that dissapates with time. Small amount of yeast at the bottom of the bottle does not seem to affect clarity.  S: Floral, fairly light American hop aroma. Could not detect much, if any, malt on the nose.  T: The hops are definately out in front, but not over-agressive. Nice citrus flavor and good bitterness. Has decent malt background, but it is definately overshadowed by the hops. Still, does not have the bitterness of an American IPA.  M: Mouthfeel is enhanced by healthy carbonation, but is not overwhelming.  D: The beer's greatest quality is its drinkability. It maintains enough of a malt base to be well balanced while showcasing classic American hops. A great example of an American Pale Ale, it's an easy beer to drink and appreciate every day.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,youngleo,4.1,"Poured to a nice head. Head had a slight orange color to it. Also had some nice lacing. Ale was golden orange in color. Very pretty. Left some sediment at the bottom of the bottle. Had that citrus hoppy pine smell to it. Smelled good. Tasted of citrus, hoppy pine, malt, with a slight bitter aftertaste. Felt good in the mouth. Carbonation was good. Very drinkable. Would love to try a session with this ale. This is another one of those brews that you would have to be carefull with. They go down very smooth.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,CrazyMacHarris99,4.28,"Pours a clear orange with yellow tinted edges. There is a large soapy head that results in a thin layer, a thick ring and copious amounts of lacing all over the glass. The smell is clean and not overpowering. There is some fresh cut grass and lemon zest with a slight fruit and flower lingering in the back. The taste is not overly hoppy like too many APAs nowadays. Its clean and refreshing with a very balanced malt and hop mixture. Its a little bland for someone who is used to a lot of hops but perfect for the style. This one is great as a good old standby that can be drank all day long.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,KTCamm,4.15,"A reliable classic. With all of the micros and craft brews out there today, its easy to forget how good this beer has been for so long.  Pours a light amber color - mine had minimal foam, but I attribute that to the bartender pouring it.  Mild aroma, some pine, some citrus and hints of the hops lurking withing.  The last Sierra I had was a Hop Harvest, so I was waiting for the hop explosion that never came. This taste here is classic Pale Ale - great taste, but with nothing that overwhelms you in any one direction.  Drinkability - I only had one with lunch, but many times before I have worked my way well into a purchased six pack. This is an easy beer to double up on.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

The smell is a mix of citrus fruits such as lemon, grapefruit, and a little orange. There is also a big of earthy flavor that comes out in the nose, not grassy but leafy.  The taste is citrus with a good bitterness that touches a few spots in my mouth and leaves it's mark. It has a sweet sugary flavor that is quite interesting.  This beer has a nice light feel to it. Has little carbonation and is easy drinking.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,GilGarp,4.05,"This is long overdue. One of the most widely available and highly regarded American pale ales and I've never reviewed it... despite having it numerous times!  Pours from the stubby bottle into a pint glass. It has a pale golden yellow color with nice white head. The head retention is ok but it does leave some sparse lacing behind.  Aroma is hoppy but not over the top. Sweet and piney with some citrus/graprefruit notes.  Flavor is a nice balance but leans towards sweet with pineapple and pear on the front and hoppy sour bitterness on the end.  Mouthfeel is a little thin but nicely carbonated.  Drinkability is there and, since it's not too heavy or hoppy, it could be a reasonable session.  Not especially hoppy relative to what's availble today but certainly tasty. I'm sure when it was introduced it was on the leading edge of hop-forward beers. This is probably one of the better beers that's easy to find no matter where you are. It's a tribute to SN to have gotten this beer so far that it sits side-by-side with all the mass produced American macros in most bars and restaurants.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

However, it ended uip being a deep gold with a very frothy and bubbly off-white head and very nice lacing.  Smells of grapefruit, with a well-balanced malt sweetness backing it up.  The taste, at first, is straight grapefruit. However, as it settles in your mouth, it develops a bready, doughy flavor that is surely from the malt profile.

The nose doesn't offer much, but it is nice. The main aromas are citrus, bread and a hint of flowers. The taste is more of the same with a good amount of bitterness at the finish.  The mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is high; I could easily toss back a few.  This is a nice example of the style, and it remains a staple in my refrigerator.

140,276,BeanBone,4.55,"Appearance: A clear, brilliant golden orange body with millions of particles suspended within. On top, a bubbly white head that leaves above average lacing.  Aroma: Gloriously bright, citrusy Cascade hops over a sweet malt backbone. Mouthwatering, to say the least.  Taste: Decently bitter Cascades up front, in just the right proportion for a Pale Ale. A solid caramel-biscuity malt base keeps everything in perfect balance. Little hints of booze from time to time. Near perfect proportions.  Mouthfeel: A medium body with moderate carbonation. Very refreshing.  Drinkability: Amazingly quaffable, I could run through a six-pack of this without even realizing it.  Verdict: Simply brilliant and perfectly balanced, there's no wonder why this has become the classic American Pale Ale.

140,276,bluesoul,4.12,"A - Poured into pint glass a pretty gold with two fingers of white, bubbly foam. Leaves quite a bit of lace.  S - Not a bad-smelling beer, but doesn't distinguish itself really. It IS an improvement over the smells in your average BMC creation. Very similar to SN Celebration, which I had first.  T - A bit lighter than Celebration (no surprise there), but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Still plenty of hops, but doesn't have the sweet finish that Celebration does. In the end the beer tilts toward the hoppy end of the spectrum.  M - Slick and light-bodied. Finish is bitter but clean. Can't detect any alcohol over the hops. Carbonation is just a touch weak but not enough to really matter.  D - Given my choice I'll take the Celebration Ale over the Pale Ale when it's available but Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is a quality beer. Easily sessionable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Smell is not terribly strong, but what is there is almost completely floral hoppiness. Malt is hinted at in the back end. Taste is mostly of the hoppy floral variety, with a bready aftertaste.

The first taste to hit the tongue is the citrus hops which immediately mixes with a smooth, bready malt. The malt that blends with hops really makes for a nice dry, yet smooth finish.  This is definitely one of my favorite APAs. It is balanced nicely with the hops still maintaining the front seat. Having this on tap even makes it that much better.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Not much malt in the nose, but solid hop presence. Flavor matches aroma closely. The lack of body is noticed right away. Very drinkable, but the flavors becomes unnoticeable quickly. This is a solid go-to beer that never lets you down, but rarely thrills the drinker. I have long maintained that, due to the prominence of hops and lack of malt body, this should be called an IPA, not a pale ale.

Light, clear orange pouring from the bottle and in the glass. Fizzy appearance with a light head. No haze at all. Piney hops in the nose. Crisp, clean mouthfeel with just a bit of a sticky finish.

Poured with very little head, but a lacing remained through the whole thing.  Smelled of hops and malts, possibly a bit sweeter and more fruity than most APAs I've had before.  The taste was surprisingly good for me. This one is less hoppy than some pale ales I've had in the past so it was easier for me to warm up to. Somewhat crisp and very very clean and fresh tasting. The aftertaste was of hops and otherwise clean.  The mouthfeel was average. Appropriately smooth. Compliments the beer just fine but nothing special.

Also finishes with a slight bitterness that is pleasant.  M - Crisp mouthfeel with carbonation that compliments taste perfectly. Medium bodied and slightly creamy feel. Great mouthfeel.  D - A refreshing brew that is delightfully simple. As stated earlier the bitterness is initially pleasant, however it seemed to wear on me after awhile. Nonetheless the taste was still pleasing.

Sweet grapefruit aroma, presumably from cascade or similar hops. Strong malty smell. Nice cascade hop hit, but would have expected more hoppiness from an APA. Nice malty bite, but next to no bitterness. Rather thin, but nice carbonation.

140,276,magikbaker,4.22,"Here goes my first beer review ever. I am more nervous than expected. Please send me messages and let me know how I did, Thanks:  Bottle poured into a pint glass  A: Golden base with an orangish tint, slightly cloudy. Poured with a white head that formed to about a half-inch on the initial pour and quickly dissipated to a thin halo. There appears to be a few bubbles streams now and again. Overall a decent looking beer. Nothing too exciting.  S: Initial smell revealed a strong scent of hops with a moderate sweet scent. This beer is fairly aromatic. Hops are on the side of bitter and giving off a purely herbel scent. The beer has a good balance in my preference with bitterness overpowering the sweets, but also keeping a balance in check. There is little to no lacing which surprises me considering the hoppy smell. I am very excited to try this beer.  T: Just as suspected the bitterness slightly over powers the malt creating an incredible sensation. Almost a perfect balance in my opinion. I am a beginner brewer and am having trouble putting my finger on the tastes. It comes off as being a very simple taste with maybe a very very small fruity taste. Their is also evidence of yeast from taste and appearance. This beer is exactly what I imagine when I think of an American Pale Ale. Only complaint on taste is that it could definitely be bolder/stronger.  M: The beer is moderately carbonated and is of a medium build but nothing extreme. The fruity flavor only lasts for a split second and the rest of the flavor to a point. There is a excellent flavor that looms well after swallowing. It is def not strong enough to not make me want to get my mouth back on the glass.  D: I loved this beer and I cant believe I only have one. I am drinking it at a fairly warm temperate of 55 and it is going down way to fast. Still maybe a little too light. This beer would still be incredible to drink for taste as well as quenching my thirst after a strenuous activity. Like I said before this beer could be stronger. I feel as though I could drink it in 3 sips and not be satisfied after just one. That being said I wish I could drink 3 more right now. I love this beer!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Very light head noticed that recedes relatively quick. Smells of citrus come in first, lemon and orange, followed by tangerine. Gulp. Easy on the hop, well balanced with the malt is the highlight. The citrus taste can be noticed a tad and that makes the hop pounce a touch. Very easy on the palate.  Drinkability, why not. This is my beer of choice when the taps have no other macros available, or micros for that matter. It's also the goto beer when all other stores are out of the loop.

Bubbles stick to the sides of the glass at first, and light carbonation continues to rise throughout. Carbonation eventually completely dissipates. No lacing to speak of.  S: Wheat, hops, hint of orange.  T: Sharp hops on a wheaty foundation, a touch of citrus.  M: Carbonated. Light and bitter. Hops assault the tastebuds. A bit of metallic aftertaste.  D: Good drinkability. Easy drinkin'. A certain refreshing quality.  Really solid pale ale. Decent atmosphere, not a very complex flavor but good for hopheads. Does have a bit of a metallic feel, but good drinkability.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,darklordlager,4.57,"Pours a deep golden colour, with nice 1/2"" head that retains.  Smell is of grapefruit, citrus, lemon, some pale malt.  Taste is a smack in the face of fresh hops, as it moves along the palate the flavours subtly change and blend, joining in a symphony of refreshment. Starts out fruity, and move along to a pleasant flowery taste, with a little bite.  Mouthfeel is right where it should be for a sessionable pale ale.  Highly Drinkable. Refreshing. Tasty.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,thekanna,4.37,"Had a decently old bottle of this, which is probably why it tasted different to my palate as opposed to the other reviews here.  Appearance: Pours clear brown from the bottle with not much head; the consistency of light coffee.  Smell: Very sweet. Burnt caramels and molasses. A bit like crème brûlée, but made into an essence.  Taste: Wow. Sweetness that's very fully caramel, cream, and toffee... kind of like drinking a Werther's candy. Saccarine is inundating and just the slightest artificial, but the overall smoothness and creaminess mellows it out.  Overall: Why have I not picked this up before? I guess because of its widespread availability, I didn't take it to be a good craft brew. At a price that's only slightly higher than BMCs for a sixer, this is one deal that's hard to give up.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Very solid beer.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

It absolutely sets the standard.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Not a good hoppy bitterness but a different, harsh bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Could use more malt.  Drinkability: A tad on the bitter side for me, not sure why as it doesn't seem to be the hops.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,stockingcpl,4.3,"Appearance: After seeing another cycler wearing a Sierra Nevada shirt, I thought I'd write a review of one of their selections. I was not let down. This brew pours a light/medium amber color with a thick light tan hear. Plentiful lacings were left. Carbonation threads were observed.  Smell: A light sprig pine essence was detected. The overall fullness was slight, but this is a pale ale, so nothing heavy is expected. Aromatic hops were also detected. The hops may be Cascade hops. I like.  Taste: There is on onset zip that embodies moderated hopiness. Grains were detected during the sustain. Quite pleasant. The flavor is just about right for strength. Very smooth. I'm impressed.  Mouthfeel: This brew displays crisp presence, yet there is no noasty aftertaste to ruin the next sip. Carbonation matches well with the overall presence of this brew. Another great job.  Drinkability: Great brew. Not overly opressive, yet the brew has a sufficiently strong presence to know that the brewers meant business on this recipe. This would be a GREAT selection for a backyard grill-out or an afternoon by the pool.  Prosit! Nikki",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,Reagan1984,4.33,"I apologize to the folks from Sierra Nevada. Why? Because sometimes I forget how awesome Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is. How can this be the 8th style of a Sierra Nevada beer that I review? Well, I tell you, it's because I take it for granted, and so do a bunch of BA'ers. It's the faithful friend who is there and doesn't cause any trouble or ask for anything. But is there when you need him, even if he's been ignored lately. Thankfully that ended today when I enjoyed a couple of pints for lunch.  How easily we forget greatness.  One finger of creamy white head topped the bright copper/amber beer with golden highlights. The clarity was amazing and there was a ton of lacing. A stunning beer.  The aroma was of a big pine forest with some fruit tones. Some grains..  Flavor was a wonderful combination of Pine, and fresh baked bread. You get the sense of some fruit as it warms slightly. Also a nice white pepper spice happening. This seems to play well with the pine notes. There is a nice hop finish. Probably aggressive for a person stepping up for the first time. But it's really perfect.  This beer has a bright mouth feel and a medium body. Just Awesome.  I know this makes no sense but this beer Underrated by being over rated. I pledge to stop my journey for new beers and pay homage to the greatness of Sierra Nevada Pale ale again soon.  Great/classic beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,cpn920,3.95,I have had this pale ale many times and just getting around to reviewing it. It pours a nice golden amber with a head that dissipates rather quickly. The immediate aroma that I detect is a floral/piney smell. The taste is pretty smooth with acceptable bitterness and subtle malt characteristics. It has a nice mouthfeel with a semi dry finish. I could drink these through out the evening and be very satisfied. Not an overly hopped or sweet APA.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Smell: Piney, with a very familiar scent of citrus, refreshing and clean.  Taste: Full of flavor, strong hop taste at the start with a malted barley finish, medium-bodied; Bitter hints, including heavy notes of citrus grapefruit and a peppery taste at finish that accompanies the beer as it seems to sweeten.  Mouth feel: Good bite, refreshing, very crisp.  Drinkability: All together relatively smooth with a mild bite, easier to drink with sweetening aftertaste; very enjoyable.

Constant bubbles.  Smells like springtime. That's the best way I can describe it--springtime.  Crisp and balanced hops and malt in that livey, fresh style that I find typical of Californian beers. Highly carbonated but not innapropriate. Makes me want to mow a lawn.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,redjameskidd,4.15,"What can I say that hasn't already be said? It's a classic. From the stubby bottle and the green label to the taste of the floral cascades, this is probably the beer we most owe for the craft beer revolution.  Great for introducing people to the style.

140,276,beerthulhu,4.45,"A: Poured a brilliantly clear orange with a soft, creamy 1 finger dirty white head that settled rather quickly to a thin, sparse covering. Visible carbonation was very light.  S: The nose started out with a dry grassiness at first before giving way to a sweet citrusy nature.  T: The initial flavor starts out with a great graininess with a citrusy and light pine hopping. Quenching citrusy bite. The crisp, pale malting truly stands out here is never overshadowed by the bright citrusy nature. Finishes with a touch of grassiness and dried grapefruit. There is a reason why this is considered the staple per style. To many modern pales have been bastardized by amercian's lust for hops while neglecting the true intended crisp pale nature of the drink. This one offers a great balance with a crisp malting with a touch of malt sweetness and hopping that is balanced perfectly.  M: medium, oily viscosity with a nice feel and light dried citrus hop fade.  D: By style one of the best. Crisp, refreshing with a great malting and true to style.

Visible yeast sediment throughout the beer.  Carmel malts, twangy hops make up the nose. Sweetness with a touch of fragrant floral characteristic. Not complex, but plenty good.  Good, bright hop bitterness up front, nice citrus flavors. The sweet, caramel malts are present too; this is a balanced beer. Nice, drying hop aftertaste. Good hop burps, too.  Feels more than adequate in the mouth. Good amount of carbonation. I can drink this all night, which I am right now during this small break from playing Rock Band.  This is a great session beer, and a fine example of an APA. Obviously, no one needs me to tell them that. A fine Rock Band beer, too.

S: A strong smell of citrus, and something resembling freshly baked cookies...a bit sugary.  T: Crisp, citrus-y hop flavors with minimal malt presence. Seems to get sweeter as the beer warms up, tasting a bit like candy...if candy were made out of hops.  M: Well carbonated, and feels very crisp and refreshing. Even so, it also feels somewhat thin.  D: The crispness ultimately wins out over what I'm perceiving as thinness. This is a pretty drinkable brew. Just slightly high on the ABV to be a session beer, I suppose, but still one of which I'd have a few in a row.

140,276,KickInTheChalice,4,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pilsner glass (Would have liked a pint glass, bartender).  Appearance: A nice copper / amber color, a little cloudy but mostly translucent. A 3 cm head partially dissipates, leaving some nice lacing around the glass.  Smell: A strong citrus aroma, mostly grapefruit, with some yeast, a little caramel, and a lot of hops.  Taste: The citrus bites a little on the front end. I can sense a slight caramel sweetness before the hops come into play. Although not a sweet beer by any means, there is a slight sugary malt that serves as a segue between the different flavors. The main taste is the mostly citrus-tasting hops. Overall this is a simple beer that is held together pretty well.  Mouthfeel: This is pretty crisp, with slighty more than medium carbonation. A good balance.  Drinkability: The smoothness is definitely a plus, but it does turn a little dry at the end.

Not too thin, nice carbonation. It's a good, very crisp.  Drinkability - Pretty decent, although it's kind of hard to drink too much with all the citrus followed by the hop bitterness.

140,276,TheycallmeTim,4.32,"Poured from a bottle into an American pint glass.  What can I say that hasn't been said before? Pours up with a slightly copperish golden body and a two finger creme colored foamy head. Very soapy for a bottle beer--dies slowly, maintains plenty of skim, and sheets most of the glass. Wow.  From there it's like somebody's plopped you down in the most comfortable recliner in the universe and said, ""You are about to drink a beer that will get sick of you before you get sick of it."" Just enough hops to tell you to keep drinking--and smelling: there's plenty of flowers and grapefruit going on here-- and just enough malt to make it stand up. The balance is impeccable. But what might be the true feats here are, on the one hand, the quality and sock of the flavors given the ABV, and the insanely creamy mouthfeel on the other. What kind of yeast are these people using? Do they grow their hops in soil with flecks of gold? This almost isn't fair to other breweries.  My first advice to myself if and when I start homebrewing is to break into Sierra Nevada after hours and steal all their ingredients. I'm positive my beer will be stunning if I do, even if I end up microwaving it and stirring the wort in an unwashed kettle in which I cooked beef stew three days ago.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Taste: Good blend of hoppy flavors to an excellent carmelized profile. This beer has a mellow alcohol backdrop that is muted yet begging to pop out. Citrus notes from the nose play a big part in this finish.  Mouthfeel: Decently carbonated to make the hops nice and bitter in the finish, keeps a nice balance and doesn't lose it's body on the tongue.

The best beer on tap at lots of places that otherwise offer very little.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,jeffthecheff,4.68,"Pour is golden copper color with a nice, bottle conditioned head that covers the surface the entire time.  Good aroma full of cascade hops. Strength is moderate from the dry hops. Smells great but makes you wish for a stronger nose.  This is the best tasting pale ale out there, no wonder its the most popular. Light bodied but with a strong hop taste and moderate bitterness. This got me addicted to hops. The citrus/pine/grapefruit flavors are all there.  Mouthfeel is great all the way through. Carbonation is right on, where other pale ales have too much. Bite from bitterness is welcoming and doesn't make you cringe. Drinkability is excellent. If I want a 6 pack for one night this is a good option.  Overall this is a great beer and has to be the top american ale to start off on if your getting into craft beer. I won't leave this behind either.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,PintOHops,4.45,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance/Smell - Appears a perfect clear copper color with medium-high carbonation. Thin head with beautiful lacing. Looks fresh and inviting! Smells of slightly sweet raisins, with dry citrus hops & pine that dominates. Again very fresh & inviting. A little malt as well.  Taste/Mouthfeel - Tastes of very dry hops with citrus and pine notes. Good strong hop bitterness that lingers on the palate well. Some caramel notes, and some malt as well. Not much change as it warms. Mouthfeel has lively carbonation on the palate, and is a little chewy. Goes down smoothly and easily. Medium bodied.  Drinkability/Final thoughts - I could find myself enjoying 3-5 of these on any occasion. I can't get over those dry citrus/pine notes, and that dominate hop bitterness! Nice and rich, the flavors marry so well together. Very decently priced, I absolutely love this beer. Everyone must try this, even if you must seek to find. Believe me, its worth it. Cheers!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Offa,2.86,"On tap, this is at least ok, rather bopring but slightly tasty, drinkable, and reasoanbly balanced in character (unlike from thE bottle, in which form I find it dreadful)  It looks good on tap, with a nice copper body, a decent, lasting off-white head and some decent, lasting lace.  The aroma is a decent, basic ale, with a little grain, crackers, and citrusy hops, but rather muted and simple.  On tap, the taste is really rather bland, with just some hops, mostly grapefruit and other citrus, plus a light grain quality that mostly takes over in the end.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,SickBrew,4.1,Poured from a standard 12oz bottle into my favorite pils class. This beer is well know in the west as one the all time favorite pale ales.  The brew pours with about a finger of good persistent head which leaves a bit of lacing. Color is a rich golden hue which is a bit pale due to the unfiltered suspended particles. Taste is clean crisp and fresh with a definite hop character. Malts are subdued but lend some balance to the flavor. Taste does finish with touch of dryness. Mouthfeel is light which equates with a high drinkability and the carbonation is just about right. Overall this is a highly drinkable beer that really good.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Jablonski,4.17,"It's a great everday beer, and I tend to enjoy one or two in the evening or early afternoon.  Appearance: amber colored.  Smell: nothing very distinct except a hint of hops.  Taste: very balanced taste; the hops slightly overpower the malt taste.  Mouthfeel: not overcarbonated, which is often the biggest turn off for me in a pale ale",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,jdmorgan,4.1,"Pours an amber hue with one-finger white head.  The smell has an immediate hop aroma and a hint of malt. The taste is led by hop flavor that is merged well with a medium malt body. There is a bit of floral notes and malt sweetness, but all in balance. Bitterness is on the upper end of medium, but not too extreme. Consistency is medium and carbonation is medium/high.  The drinkability of this beer is good because it's a rather solid brew with an unashamed hop presence. Another great beer from SNBC, and one of my stand-by APAs.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,WakeandBake,4.17,"Clear bronze color, with a nice two finger white head that lasts a bit. A little lacing. A nice floral,citrus hop aroma,a little spice.

140,276,ZimZamZoom,3.88,"Aggressive pour from a 12-oz bottle into a pint glass. I got a nice whiff of hops during the pour which is always nice. Clear bronze color, with a nice almost white head that is fluffy and lasting. The lacing is pretty impressive too.  Aroma of citrusy hops, subtle but very pleasant. There is not much beyond that for me. The taste is again pleasantly citrus in nature, this time balanced by a decent hit of malty goodness. The whole thing turns bitter in the middle and this carries through nicely into the finish. This beer is hard to sip, I will say that. Tasty and refreshing, even on a cold winters night.  Medium bodied, smooth feel, nicely carbonated. Quite frankly this is an eminently drinkable APA. I usually pass it up in the store in search of anything new or different, but I'm glad I snagged a sixer tonight.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

S: Very faint (I'm in a place that cooks pizza's on the open flame so no suprise that's all I really smell)! Pine hops are all I can detect.  T: Crisp. Snappy. A great hoppy pale ale. Perfect bitterness for the style IMO.  M: Light. Palate cleansing. Great beer to enjoy with a meal because it's not overpowering.  D: Super high!

140,276,RickS95,3.83,"I had this years ago, but didn't appreciate it. I just thought it was bitter. I'd like to think my taste buds have matured since then, and I tried this the other night with an open mind (and because they were giving away logo glasses if you bought one).  It poured a nice-sized white head. Dark caramel in color, filtered. Strong scent of hops in the nose, nothing unusual there.  Seemed highly carbonated and bitter in the mouth. Lacing was ok, I thought I remembered more.  Being a pale ale, it had the standard issue hoppy, bitter finish that lasted. But it was refreshing at the same time.  I had this while eating Mexican food. It really went well with the spice hot nachos. I enjoyed the beer this time, so much so that I had two El Gordo glasses (22-ounce) and got to take home to Sierra Nevada logo glasses.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Citrusy aroma, with some slight hop bitterness. Taste is similar. Crisp and refreshing, with slightly sweet citrus notes, ending with alcohol warmth and hop bitterness. Nicely balanced between malt and hops, as it should be.

T - Hit's my mouth with hops and mellows out with some citus notes, then pans out with a nice clean and crisp pine finish. Lots of good character for a relatively common Pale Ale.  M - Not too bad, but a bit on the thin side for me. Good carbonation.  D - This beer has some serious drinkability. It has a really good flavor that is not overpowering, but is smooth and refreshing.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Taste - Great taste. Good balance but also a good pronounced hops flavor. Not too sweet, not too bitter.  Mouthfeel - Excellent mouthfell. Perfect carbonation.  Drinkability - Goes down smooth. Light after taste that is very similar to grapefruit juice.  Great beer. First time trying it, but will definitely buy this one again sometime. Should be on everyones list of a beer to try at least once.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,biegaman,4,"A deep bodied yellow shaded in with tones of amber. A seemingly infinite number of tiny bubbles sprout up from the base and race to the top. Clarity exist but in a somewhat blurred state. The top half inch is peach hued and adhesive enough to envelop the glass above it.  Notes of citrus, grass and pine combine for a pleasant effervescence. It is a soft fruitiness that includes orange blossom and a squirt of lemon juice. The hop character is pronounced but moderate - it's not a smack to the sinus but rather a gentle tickling of the nostrils.  Hints of grapefruit and citrus fruit are noted in the flavour, too. More prevalent now, however, is the taste of lightly toasted, caramel laced malts. It's not exactly a rich, gooey presence but it adds an extra shot of flavour to what is otherwise a very simple beer.  The hops might snip at those not accustomed to bitterness but should definitely be considered restrained. The modest 37 IBUs add a nice underlying quench to each sip. Crisp mouthfeel and good carbonation only adds drinkability to what was already something quite tasty.  Sierra Nevada is rightfully regarded as the grandfather of the American craft beer revolution. Their pale ale was particularly inspirational for a generation of craft brewers that are now re-inventing old world styles and hopping at levels previously unheard of - All hail it !",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Am I tasting orange in this beer? Finishes dry with just the right amount of hops. Wow, I'm impressed with this beer's nice flavor.

What I remember was that it lasted like grass and piney bitterness, yet sweet and...I wanted more.  Pours golden amber with a tight beige head that falls to a nice lace. Nose is pine with biscuty malt then follows to a slight citrus. Hops are spicy, fruity, and floral while the Cascade bitterness lasts throughout the tasting to the back of the throat with easy carbonation. So many flavors in this brew and is so drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,LoRezDave,3.92,"Served on-tap at Hog Island Oyster Co. in San Francisco.  Pours clear ligh amber. A proper 2-finger pour leaves a nice head.  Fantastic hop-nose not over-bearing.  Carbonation keeps bubbles coming throughout the session. Which is very nice and keeps a thin layer of head on the surface. Perfect lacing thank you Mr. Hops.  Mouthfeel is full and slightly oily from the hops - definitely not ""slick"" though.  Hops are in the forefront of taste. Malt has a nice ever-so-slight carmely taste.  The grand-daddy of PA's never fails. This one is especially fresh and ""bright"" tasting.

Minimal head that disappears pretty quickly  S: Strong hop profile. Very ""herbal"".  T: Initially very heavy on the hops, butts right up against being too bitter and piney, but backs off, well, tapers off, at the finish without going too far. Just barely.  M: Crisp and consistent, start to finish.  D: Quite drinkable, but I feel like it needs food to accompany it. I just cannot see myself putting these away without a meal or a snack.  Overall, I would drink it if it was there, or in the absence of one of my favorites, but I am not going to seek it out.

Pretty good lace on the way down. A ton of bubbles riding the entire perimeter of the glass.  A very nice, crisp, hoppy, pine scent to this that leaves a nice citrus aroma on the back end.  This has a nice grapefruit/citrus flavor with some delicious bitter hop, that never overpowers the whole beer. A great balance of malt detected throughout.  This beer is an excellent example of this style. Easily sessionable, refreshing, very nice carbonation and a very nice piney aftertaste. Due to the overall availability of this beer, it has become my session beer of choice as of late.

It was a very small head and it dissipated very quickly leaving just that thin layer of bubbles so you know its a beer still. It was a deep amber color which was beautiful and you could still see some yeast sediment at the bottom which I liked. S= very good and floral. I like hoppy beers and this was a great balance with hops and malt. T= beautiful. Not to hoppy not to malty. great balance M= Lower carbonation.

I had it on tap and it pours with a beautiful head. Nice deep golden color with nice fulffy white head. The scent is very strong with the hops but the taste is balanced when you drink it. It's a great hot day beer or for tailgating. It can be used in alot of diffrent recipes and goes great with a wide variety of food.

Very fresh and not terribly strong.  T: Starts off heavy on the hops, nice citrus crispness with a pine finish. More malt balance than I would have expected - this really isn't a bitter pale ale like you may expect from the smell or the initial bite. Finishes very clean.  M: Nothing special, very crisp and a pretty even feel start to finish. Little to no aftertaste.  D: For 5.6abv, this is a drinkable brew. It's light for a pale ale so you can easily put away a few of them, and it's appropriate for any season or food pairing really.

Scent is surprisingly not as hoppy as I would have thought. Lots of fruit and a woody/grassy aroma I couldn't place. Palate is crisp, clean and very dry. Not as hoppy as a lot of Pales and IPAs.

140,276,seedsofchaos,4.22,"Classic amber in appearance with a delicate off-white head. Lacing is present but not enticing. Carbonation is active through a beautifully transparent body. Carbonation has a nice effect on the bouquet by exemplifying the Pacific Northwest hops that put off a great smell of citrus and sweet candy. A touch of pine perhaps but the hops are floral and citrus forward. Caramel malts seem to dominate most of the malt aroma but there is just a tad of biscuit that evens out the sweetness.  Taste is a great balance of malt and hops that goes down smooth. Bitterness is low on this crisp beer with hops showing up vegetative at times but, again, obviously floral and citrusy. Very well balanced and pleasant for a pale ale.  Perhaps the definition of sessionable in my opinion. Refreshing even more so when thinking about having a few of these after a warm summer day.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

The head dropped to a thin skim and left huge amounts of web-like clingy lace down my glass.  S= This one was served to me way too cold, but after letting it warm a bit I found lots of West Coast citrusy hop aromas as well as a biscuity maly base. More hops than malt, but still within the boundaries of what I would call balanced for the style.  T= I was pleasantly surprised to find that as this ale warmed, there were flavors other than the obvious pine and grapefruit citrus coming forth. Initial hop rush was bitter and puckering and the malt base followed with bready flavors and bakery sweetness. The yeast effect on the flavor was limited to only the slightest fruitiness as this was a very clean ale. The finish was dry and the alcohol was only minimally detectable.  MF= Medium bodied. Crisp feel from the medium+ carbonation level.  D= A classic ale and it had been way too long since I had one on tap.

I love the crystal clear Amber color this beer has, and the nice white/light brownish colored head it produces, which seems to last for a good few minutes. I'm not too great on getting the scent of a beer, but I would say this had a nice almost flowery aroma to it. The taste is good, a slight bread flavored bitterness followed by a very slight tangy taste that I can only describe as fruity, almost apple and citrus flavored.

140,276,PerzentRizen,4.52,"Juicy hops, fresh flavor, and a great warm weather bite that makes you fall in love with it.  I poured mine into a footed long-stemmed sierra nevada tulip glass. The color is an apple cider color with amazing clarity despite the note on the top of the bottle concerning yeast sediment. This should be served chilled to around 45-55 degrees.  The smell is of fresh juicy hops and light malty alcohol (only an illusion as this beer is only 5.6% ABV.  The taste is fresh, tart and exceedingly good. I really love this pale ale because it has the bite of an IPA and the body of a traditional pale ale. I love the hop character.  The mouthfeel is a light, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. For the style the mouthfeel is very good (I generally like the more substancial beers in mouthfeel so I had to push myself to rate this a 4.0).  This is an exceedingly drinkable beer. In fact I plan on finishing my six pack in the next few hours as I enjoy the afternoon.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,PatrickJR,4.1,"For whatever reason, I wasn't a huge fan of this beer when I first tried it. Since I have had so much of it since then, I owe it a better review.  Poured from 12 oz bottle into nonic pint glass.  A - Two finger head that recedes to patchy white cap. Decent lacing, transparent golden/amber with continuous streams of bubbles from the bottom.  S - Great hop aroma. Big grapefuit peel is balanced by equally large floral aroma. Slight graininess from the malt.  T - Starts off with an aggressive but not unpleasant hop flavor which quickly turns into a bitter, dry finish. Lots of citrus and floral going on. Pale malt profile provides adequate backing.  M - Highly carbonated and refreshing. Carbonation keeps the hops in check and makes for a crisp brew.  D - One of the most drinkable craft beers out there. Full of flavor and pretty unoffensive. A great stand-by.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,seanyfo,4.3,"35cl bottle poured into a Kolsch Stange  A - Deep amber/copper colouring, 3 finger head that dissapates quickly but leaves good lacing.  S- Sweet malts first, some caramel, faint floral hoppy notes, flowery  T- Floral notes come through first, nice caramel sweetness offsets this and finishes with a subtle hop sharpness.  M- Moderate carbonation, moderate to full body  D- Nice interplay of hop bite and sweetness. Flavours not overpowering and this makes for a sessionable yet interesting ale. A Winner!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,gabeerfan,4.32,"Poured a clear medium amber with a nice white head that fell to a thin ring/whispy cap. Very hoppy aromas. Lots of grapefruit and pine with some fresh cut grass. There are malts present, but they are bit players in this beer. Flavors are a little smoother than the aroma would lead you to believe. There are still lots of grapefruit/pine/grass flavors. Light brown sugar malts make a larger appearance, but the are still pretty subdued compared to the hops. Medium-light mouthfeel. Not oily like an IPA and good carbonation to help keep the palate clean but still the hop bitterness does linger, but not forever. Pretty drinkable. Good flavors and low ABV make this a good drinker for the night. This is probably many BA's gateway beer. This wasn't my first craft brew, but it was about my favorite. Great beer that should be shared with as many people as possible.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,yossarian14,4.6,"On top of all the high marks for quality, I also have a soft spot for this brew, as it was a benchmark in my beering adventures. It became a beer to which I compared all others. I have recently taken to almost exclusively trying new beers of all styles (which I highly recommend) but I came upon this bottle in my inlaws fridge, and instantly decided it would be my next (third) review. I have a solid twenty minutes before I am noticed missing, and plan to cherish each and every one.  A-Light clear bubbly amber color with a large almost half-a-glass head (I poured into a curved Boddintons pint glass)that sticks around and then leaves some lacing.  S-When I smell a Sierra Pale Ale I get that green fresh hoppy IPAish sense in my head  T-But the taste is something smoother and more refreshing than expected.The bitter hops remain after a well balanced initial mouthful.  M-Carbonation is present and tingly throughout your mouth. Gets a little heavy and syrupy as it warms. I would tend to not want to let this one sit too long in the sun.  D-This one has given me many a headache which earns it a 5 in Drinkability",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,ectomorph,4.3,"12 oz bottle decanted into a pint glass leaving the sediment behind.  A - Orange and amber in color with a Thin white head that remains intact.  S - Citrus and flowers balanced with malt crackers and bread.  T - Excellent balance between the hop citrus and the bread finish. The Pale Ale standard.  M - Moderate body and carbonation, nice and even.  D - Very high. All day with any food.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,birchstick,4.2,"A - pours a clear amber with a gorgeous head S - smells almost like an IPA, but there is a nice touch of honey and malts as well T - this is starts off with a bit of malts, which give way hops. I was surprised that this wasn't very bitter given the aroma and amount of hops in this. M - full and nicely carbonated D - this makes for a perfect go-to beer. It is also a hoppier version of a pale ale, but the increased hops works well in this beer. This is one of my staples when I am out at bars without much variety. Always a good choice.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,beerfairy,4,"Had it many times, just getting around to reviewing it.  A- Golden honey color with a nice head.  S- Very hoppy, citrus smell from cascade hops.  T- Very hoppy, good mouthfeel and slightly bitter.  M- Medium-light mouthfeel, that finishes dry.  D- I can take or leave this beer, although it is a big seller so lots of people like it.

Smell is pretty malty, I was expecting a bit more hop smell in the nose but the malt was overwhelming. THis beer is so smooth and goes down very well a nice balance with the hop and the malt not overpowering but a nice solid flavor of earth and citrus.

140,276,tedsox31,4.33,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Goose Island pint glass. The color is a clear amber with a nice frothy, white head that retains well and leaves lacing on the side of the glass.  The smell is floral to me, along with some yeast and grains. I like it very much.  This is a sharp, fruity taste. I notice the fruits first, followed by some citrus and yeast, and finishing with the grainy hops taste. It has such a good hops taste at the finish. Keeps making me come back for more.  Clean, medium mouthfeel. There is carbonation, but it balances nicely with the rest of the beer.  Overall, a very drinkable beer. A session beer if I have ever had one, what with the generally low abv (comparatively) and the tastiness. I am looking forward to making the original recipe that you can find in Papazian's book.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Jayli,4.2,This light amber brew throws out dense white head that creates a nice lacing throughout the entire beer. There is a wonderful blast of hops in the aroma. The flavor follows this same trend. Great hop character with a fantastic understated bitterness. Underlying malt is sufficient. Pretty clean tasting for an ale. This is one that is good to go all night. One of my favorite Pale Ales.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,maximum12,3.4,"Well, I think enough virtual ink has been spilled over this beer. The basics have been covered about 1,500 times.  For me, this is certainly a beer worth trying. While not one of my favorite styles, it has the misfortune of following Alpha King by a short time span, & suffers by comparison to that proof of God.  It has the requisite bite, pale color, low ABV, but it's a bit more obvious & less refined that the class of the APA field. But a good beer to go & sip around a bonfire on a warm fall night, which is what I will be doing in roughly five minutes.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,champ103,4.17,"A: Pours a deep amber orange color. A billowing white head rises to over two fingers with excellent retention. Lace left all the way down the glass. S: Floral hops and grapefruit. Some citrus and piney aroma as well. T: Bitter grapefruit up front. Some floral hops and citrus fruit again. Pale and cracker like malts, even a touch of sweetness help balance everything out. Bitterness lingers, which like many people use to put me off way back in the day. Now I love it. M/D: A medium body that has a crisp snap on the tongue, just excellent carbonation. A nice creaminess follows, which finishes clean and dry. Very moreish, especially when fresh. Something I have only learned to like more and more as each year goes by. A classic.  I use to think this was too bitter, but that many many years ago. Now, its just a classic example that all in the style is compared to.

Someone came from the free bar with one of these and I asked him how it was - he shook his head, ""not so good, dude"" - I saw him later enjoying a Corona.  This is really good - hints of many flavors, and a really slight bitterness, which I normally would not like - but it's almost nothing and disappears immediately.  I was eating various cheese cubes and mashed potatoes - but this would have been good on it's own I think - good beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

A- Clover honey color with a 3/4 inch creamy white head that falls to just a creamy glaze on the surface.  S- Very hoppy with grapefruit and honey.  T- Sweet caramel malts up front beautifully transitioning in to a quite bitter brew with lots of hops and grapefruit taking the forefront.  M- Medium-light mouthfeel, that finishes dry.  D- I love this beer and is one of my most popular session beers. 4 in a sitting is perfect.  This was one of my first beers and still one of my favorites.

Far stronger aroma than when had from the bottle. Smells almost IPAish.  T - Light malt sweetness up front, primarily caramel. Quickly overcome by a juicy hoppiness. Taste of grapefruit with a hint of something a little more tart.  M/D - Medium bodied. Easily drinkable.

There are some nice floral aromas mixed with a nice citrus aroma which smells like grapefruit and mandarin orange slices. As it warms, aromas of yeast come through as well. Very pleasant.  Taste starts off citrusy which then yields to the bitterness from the hops. There is also some malt flavors in there as well, but they seemed hidden to me. The finish has some nice bitterness to it and is also very dry. Mouthfeel is relatively smooth. Moderately drinkable, for me anyway.  Overall this is very nice example of an American Pale Ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,philipquarles,3.95,"Pours a clear copper with a smallish white head. Retention isn't great, nor is the lacing. Still looks good though.  Smells of hops up front, with a bit of pine/juniper, citrus and some sweet malt. The citrus really comes forward on the palate, and with the hops and malt makes it a very well balanced, slightly bitter brew. Great example of a pale ale.  Very drinkable overall; thanks to the lowish ABV, something I could actually drink all night.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,JustinBathurst,3.85,"Poured clear orange-copper with 1 cm white crown. Good lacing.  Smells of citrus, red licorice, and dry cereal (think Cheerios).

Firm pour yields a 2 finger head that diminishes quickly. No lace to speak of. Beer pours a nice orange/golden amber.  Nose- Citric hops, not over whelming, but strong enough to let you know what you are in for.  Taste- Muted citric sweetness, followed by tart and tangy citric hops. Carmel malts rear their head. Nicely balanced, dry and bitter finish. Very nice.  Mouthfeel- Tart and tangy, highly carbonated.  Drinkability- Very high. An easy drinking pale ale.

140,276,RodBurg,4.55,"This brew is such a classic, I'm ashamed to say the first time I tried it was only about a month ago. I love the short brown bottle and the cool looking green label. The label alone conjures up images of majestic mountains and forests in the American West.  A fine layer of yeast coats the bottom of the bottle and it pours out a beautiful clear golden. A small, coarse head rises and doesn't stick around. No lacing.  The smell is wonderful. Crisp pale malts matched by the sharp cascade hops.  Tastes crisp, clean, and very refreshing. The malt and hops are in perfect harmony here. Slight grapefruit tones with a light/medium body and a good amount of carbonation.

A little caramel sweetness to help balance things out. M: More carbonation than I remembered, right on the edge (but not over) of too much. Crisp but not watery. A roundness on the tongue, mouth filling, tongue coating. Surprised that there is not more of a head given the mouthfeel. D: It had been a while since I had had one of these.

140,276,glid02,3.98,"Got this on tap at Dark Horse Tavern in Atlanta.  Pours a dark copper color with about a one finger head. Diminshes into a small layer of bubbles with not very much lacing.  This has a good floral smell with some of the bitters that are to come. Not as aromatic as some other APA's I've had, but certainly pretty nice.  This tastes pretty similar to how it smells. Some floral taste with a lot of the token Cascade bitter. Not a whole lot else going on, but what's done is done well.  Mouthfeel is alright, good carbonation and a pretty good thickness. Could be just a little thicker, although I may be expecting more of an IPA thickness than an APA. I'd wager that I'm not, but if I am then sue me.  This is a very drinkable beer. Goes down smooth with no unwanted aftertaste. The bitterness is expected and welcomed.  Overall if you haven't tried this, try it, but really who hasn't? It's a little better on tap than what I've had from the bottle - looks prettier and the flavors are a little more subdued and crisper. Definitely worth a try on tap if you've only had it from a bottle. If you've never tried it then definitely try it, be it from a tap or from a bottle.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Antilochus,3.97,"On tap at the White Horse in Parsons Green. Served in a branded, Eurostamped SNPA pint glass. Nice! Cost 4 quid though.  Orangey-golden body, nice consistent white head. Leaves a bit of lace. Nothing spectacular here but lives up to expectations.  Tangerine, orange peel, malt backbone, a bit of rust and some pine sneaking in there as well. Quite good. West coast-lite.  Palate is well balanced for a hoppy APA, well-rounded with plenty of malt presence and reasonably fresh hop character. Pine really comes through, solid bitterness makes this a very drinkable and classic APA. Reminds me a lot of St. Ambroise Pale from McAuslan.  Recommended.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,kinger,3.85,"Definitely a nice surprise, I had a feeling this ale would be good but not this good! Pours a nice copper color with decent creamy head and an abundance of lacing. The aroma is highly hopped with a nice malt scent. Mouthfeel is thick and filling with an unbelievably smooth crisp finish. The flavor is the perfect balance of bittering hops and malts for a pale ale. This is a great standard for the pale ale style and an exceptional example.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,goatherder,3.91,"Golden in colour, great clarity for a bottle conditioned beer and an ample white head. Big hop aroma up front, tangerines and rockmelons with the malt peeking through as the beer warmed up. A firm hop slap up front with all the fruitiness of the aroma which gives way to a wonderfully round, bready malt flavour. The bitterness is well balanced and gives a crisp end to the maltiness. The mouthfeel is middle to thin with the carbonation just a bit high for my liking. This combines with the relatively high abv to inhibit the drinkability for me. This beer comes with quite a reputation and I'm happy to say it lives up to it. A great example of an APA, able to showcase the hops whilst allowing the malt to shine through too.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,bobhits,3.34,"How does one review a beer like this? My gut reaction is to essentially call this the example for a pale ale and score it solid 3's. That said the ""normal"" opinion is that this is a great pale ale. I personally do feel that while very enjoyable this is middle of the road in the pale ale category.  A. A nice thick head. I'm serving it in a stone IPA glass. A caramel color, I'd say maybe 2-3 shades of amber darker than a crappy macro if that makes any sense.  S. Lets again compare to a macro for just a half second. The malt reminded me a lot of a bud, but with a bit sweeter note, and then there is some hop aroma that a bud could only dream of. Not a lot of aroma on the whole, but nothing wrong there either.  T. This beer reminds me as far in the way it's balanced of an english pale ale, but with American hops. The thing is while compared to a macro or even an english beer the malt back is somewhat sweet, it's rather boring and imo not very great by American standards. There is a decent bit of hop flavor here, but don't expect this to come off as hoppy. It's hard to really say what flavors the hops are giving off as they're really pretty subtle. I want to say a bit of a piney flavor, but really all I get a bit a bitterness to balance things out. If you're looking for a well balanced pale ale then this is one of the best beers you'll find. If you want something that says ""American pale ale"" then this imo is a bit of a disappointment.  M. I like thicker beers even in my pale ales. That said there's enough carbonation here and it is very very drinkable. My complaints are simply why it isn't perfect.  D. Mean moons ago a friend and I played beer pong with this stuff. What more need I say? You can drink this till you're on the floor or you can have a glass with you're dinner. For me I'm not drawn to keep drinking this like some beers, but I certainly have enjoyed this bottle.  Maybe I'm become too much of a snob, but I can't say that this is a beer to seek out. Clearly it's everywhere so nobody really needs to put any effort into it. If this is on tap and not much else is, then enjoy. If you're at a place with 500+ beers, you might want to try something a bit more ""interesting.""",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Biggness,4.13,"This beer pours a nice semi cloudy amber with beautiful carbonation in it with atleast two fingers of head. The smell is mild of nuts and hops. The taste is very smoothe of a nice well balanced Pale Ale, you can not compare this beer to Alpha King Pale Ale but it is a very nice Pale ale. I was worried about the mouthfeel since the carbonation looked high but you barely notice it when you drink it and its an incredibly smoothe beer. An incredibly drinkable beer, nothing about it would slow you down. Well done and I look forward to more!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,everetends,3.68,"12 oz bottle I got out of sixer that is available everywhere, sad that this is my first sixer of SNPA. I just never got around to it and was overly critical SN for quite a while.  A: Poured a golden almost amber color. Had a decent amount of carbonation activity. Poured a fluffy white head that was a bit suprising as it had good retention. Pretty good looking brew.  S: Smell is of pine, citrus hops and touch of sweetness coming from the malt.  T: Taste is also of a touch of pine, a good amount of hops (a bit more than I was expecting), and is rounded off with the sweetness of some good malt.  M: Light to medium in body, good carbonation for the style. The slight creaminess of this brew really allows some sticky hops to hang around. Pretty crisp and refreshing.  D: Really good brew for a majorly produced micro. It really does deliver and really impressed me for the amount of beer they pump out. Sierra Nevada is about 10 bucks a sixer here and I tend to stay away from it because I can get some good brews for about 2 bucks less around here.

I've been drinking it ever since, so I figured I might as well put in my two cents. It's a great looking beer with a good sized head that laces down the glass, as the beer is finished. What I love most is the smell of this pale ale with its piny/citrusy hop aroma balanced with malt goodness. This taste is usually great though there are times where I noticed pronounced differences in the beer from batch to batch. I've found that this beer can be quite variable in aroma and taste. Usually, it hits the spot perfectly. I had it with sliced BBQ beef brisket at Joey's in Pomona and it complimented and held up quite nicely the smokiness and tangy sweetness of the BBQ sauce.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Good brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

T--Clean crisp bitter balances almost perfectly with a simple malt. This bottle didn't display any particular hop distinctives.  M--medium to light body. The carbonation is perfect, washing the palette clean with every swallow.  D--Though not a knockout in flavor, the clean finish makes it easy to keep sipping.

I guess it is because it is one of the standards and original in the field. This is a darn good beer. My only complaint is that I wish it was just slightly hoppier.

Purchased a 6 pack for the 4th of July, So I figured I would show it some love with a review.  Aggressive pour into DFH tumbler reveals a beautiful crystal clear goldish color which leaves a nice 1 inch pillowish head that sticks around for quite a while and leaves a nice lace around the glass.  S- Smell is pretty attractive. Good citrus fruits smell,Floral hops with a faint malt background.  T&M-Taste is tremendous. Mild hoppy bitterness balances well with the citrus fruits and malt leaving a nice dry feeling on the pallet that keeps you coming back for more.  D-Drinkibility is phenomenal! I would not classify this as a lawnmower beer, but it is very drinkable and also quite thirstquenching.  All in All this is a great beer, as well as a legend in the craft category. I can remember trying this beer for the first time about 11 yrs ago, And although at the time I found it to be extremely hoppy (TIMES HAVE CHANGED!!) but I also found it to be a tremendous all around beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

It pours a nice golden amber with a tight dense head that laces the sides of my beer glass.  There's a small nose-- not particularly fragrant, but a definite signature lingers in the air.  I think the flavor has a little of everything-- as a pale ale its flavor is not over-powering. It produces a definite ale signature with a nice over-all bitterness and a lingering mild fruity flavor that's completed with a lasting finish.  Mouthfeel is very cordial and it's an invitation to another bottle.  Drinkability is favorable- the alcohol content is not overwhelming so that after a pint I'm not incapacitated.  Unless they water down this beer it will always be one of my default beers-- a welcome beer I'll always come back to.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,Patrick999,4.59,"With this review, I complete the Holy Trinity of American craft beer - Sam Adams, Sierra Nevada, and Anchor Steam.  Sierra Nevada....had it a million times, but never bothered to review it. You do tend to take great beers like this for granted due to their availability. Yes, there are ""hoppier"" beers out there, but this beer is an original and one of the defining American craft beers.  This beer never fails in any of the attributes to which we assign numbers. Aromatics are not all that strong, but what a minor complaint. Taste is a perfect balance between hop, malt, and ale-yeast esters. Goes well with just about any meal you can think of, from pizza to nouveau cuisine like macadamia-nut-crusted salmon on a bed of sweet potato mash. Or, you can simply raise a few pints of it by itself.  A true American classic. The American craft beer movement owes this beer a debt of gratitude, one I'm more than happy to repay now and again by draining a glass.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

The fresh, crisp taste that follows is one welcomed aftershock. This beer also features a characteristic that is hard to find in most others, its highly drinkable over a period of time. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale never loses its allure throughout a day or for that matter, day after day. This is a great ""go to"" beer whether you're entertaining others on a holiday or just want something to sip on during the NBA Finals. Every swig leaves you wanting more of the bitter yet fresh and satisfying taste of this beer. It's very consistent and the alcoholic punch isn't a bad repercussion either.

I would join a local militia and defend this country solely for its heroic efforts devoted when brewing this precedent for American Pale Ales. Light on the malt, perfectly overflexed with hop bitterness, this beer boasts balance. Touch of dessert bread met by clean, citrus bitterness. Pure perfection when following the criteria for what an American Pale should be. I would present this hop cake at any close friend's birthday.

Lots of baked malt sweetness right behind the hop curtain. I'm a fan of the balanced smell off this beer.  T: Taste follows smell -- balanced. Hops are earthy, slightly herbal but leaning toward grassy, citric pine. Malts are dark breads.  M: Light and prickly, dryer finish.  D: Given that I've found many restaurants in my area serve this along side the usual suspects (you know what I'm talking about), I've found myself drinking this often, and enjoying it every time. Thereby, very drinkable in my book.  Overall: A well rounded pale ale. To be honest, I expected a more powerful West Coast hop presence, but they've saved that craft for other brews.

Pours as a hazy somewhat white/golden/orangeish blend with nice head and excellent retention. Smells very hoppy with a nice blend of aromas. Taste is of clean, crisp water with great flavor and hoppiness. Mouthfeel is clean, crisp, and excellent. Always a nice wallop from the hops (although sometimes the stinginess detracts from the mouthfeel as an aftertaste effect).  Drinkability is outstanding.

140,276,BryanCarey,4.47,"Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is medium bodied, with a golden/orange color. The aroma of the beer grabs your attention immediately, with a mixture of spice, hops, and citrus, and floral overtones greeting the nose. Foaminess is average. As you drink a glass of this beer, it leaves a pattern of lace on the sides of your glass and it is common to find a thin layer of yeast sediment in the bottom of the bottle.  Sierra Nevada Pale Ale has a distinct hopped flavor. This beer is brewed using two- row barley malt, caramel malt, ale yeast, Perle and Cascade Hops. The taste of the Cascade hops is obvious, but this ale also manages to have a slightly malty taste, which helps keep the beer from becoming too bitter. There is a somewhat creamy texture, with a citrus and spice accented body. The finish of the beer is bitter.  Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is a classic American Pale Ale. It may not be the best pale ale in America, but it's still very good and it stands as a benchmark to the American Pale Ale style.

Hoppy, smooth, crisp, with a bite, you can't go wrong if this is all they have for decent beer. You'll find this stuff everywhere. It's a treat, or it's a last resort, oddly enough.

Flavor is mostly hoppy, with pine and some light citrus notes being dominant. There's a bit of caramel malt in the background that comes out after the main taste but before the lingering bitter aftertaste.

Head is beautiful and clings lace to the side of the glass. Aroma is strongly floral and hoppy. Color is a beautiful golden orange.  Taste is exceptional. This sampling was sampled outdoors on a hot and humid day and served at 38 deg F... a bit colder than many purists would like. Hops and citrus are strong and stand out at the beginning, with a very slight malt coming through a moment after. Hops lingers on the palate long after consumption.

Taste: Very nicely balanced, starting out with a light, almost orangey hop character. Malt is always there, somewhat bready and adding some depth and substance to the beer. Finishes with a crisp drying hop.  Mouthfeel: a bit disappointing - smewhat flat, though this probably wouldn't be a problem from the tap.

For rating purposes I am basing it off the 24oz botttle (which I found for $1.99).  Big creamy/foamy head and amber hue.  Smooth hop aroma, piney and freshcut. Floral and a tad acidic.  Nice clean sharp hop bitterness at first, then a malt smoothness takes over, and then it goes dry and sharp hop bitterness for the finish. An exceptional APA, in fact I think it to be the quintesential APA in every respect.

140,276,steelerguy,4.33,"A - Pours a beautiful golden color with a nice thick slightly off white head. The color and carbonation is what I consider perfect for an APA. The head diminishes throughout but always covers the top and leaves a little lace.  S - Nice citrus smell from the Cascades with some malt undertones.  T - Damn...that is good. The hops hit perfectly, then the crisp citrus flavor, and ends with a nice malty sweetness. This is what I would call a stepping stone beer to get into the harder IPAs and even double IPAs. Not so hoppy or alcoholic that it is a sipper though, and is very refreshing.  M - Has a very good mouthfeel, I like the carbonation...I guess it could be a bit creamier but I am nit picking.  D - Excellent. This beer is good after getting home from work, after working in the yard for hours, with a burger at a restaurant, while watching a football game. Just a good beer for all occasions.

Smell: Nice earthy and floral hop aroma balanced with a good amount of malt.  Taste: Almost perfect pale ale. Nice amount of earthy and floral hops balanced perfectly with a nice amount of malt. Nothing overpowers and it is all very tasty.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Feels quite creamy in your mouth. Nice crisp hop flavor left behind.  Drinkability: One of the most drinkable beers out there. Nice flavor and nice balanced complexity. This is a great beer for any type of drinker and does not disappoint. Highly recommended.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,NOOGIE,4.42,"This is the staple of the frisbee cricut, always availabe. Once I showed up to a tournament this weekend my friend had one right away for me. I would always take a 6 pack of Sierra Nevada when I would go on the road to a tournament. Anyways the look of the beer has a dark amber color, little foam that disappears quickly. Smells of hops and some fruit good smell overall. The taste is very hoppy and fruity, excellent taste. The feel is smooth with carbonation, good wetness. The drinkability is very good, with an extra sweetness at the end.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,ccrida,4.77,"This is my favorite pale ale, because it's basically an IPA. Today I'm in vegas slurping these out of the 24 oz bottles, so no comments on the appearance, other then memory telling me that it looks fine, with tons of lacing from the hops.  Smell is good, bright cascades baby - there's a reason these are the classic west coast hop!  Taste is as good as it gets for an APA, nice crisp toasted malt with a huge hop backbone, but where it differentiates itself in my book is that it's not just a bitter bomb, but plenty of hop FLAVOR, with a clean finish.  Mouthfeel is crisp and snappy, this is a great hot weather beer, not to heavy in the stomach, I can and have drunk way to many of these in one sitting, very easy drinker - an exceptional world classic!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,daythree16,4.32,Poured into a pint glass at the bar. Amber in color with a one finger head that fades and leaves a little lace on the glass.  The smell is mostly of citrus with hints of candy in there. The taste is of light malt sweetness up front with citrus notes and a good hop bitterness.  The mouthfeel is very carbonated but still smooth. This is a great session beer and a very refreshing pale ale.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,adams82,4.67,"Pours copper; very bright for a bottle conditioned beer and has a pretty hefty white head.  Smells of fresh cascade hops; floral and slightly fruity, fairly citric and piney, with a hint of caramel malt.  Tastes exceptional. Lots of cascade hop flavour; floral fruity, spicy and slightly citric. A beautiful blend of hops and caramel malt, very refreshing and extraordinarily delicious. The flavour is very well balanced and is dead on for the style.  Very smooth, light, refreshing. Medium bodied with an exceptionally drinkability. One the quintessential American style Pale Ales and a wonderful beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,CamuMahubah,4.2,Amber with moderate lacing...  Has a grassy piney twang...  Taste a bit bitter a first followed by a crisp ending...  Creamy despite the hop infusion...  Quaffing beer that reminds you of when you first discovered good beer could be had. This beer reminds me of some other brewer's IPA's...,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,lacqueredmouse,4.12,"Thanks very much to my girlfriend who went in search of beer for me on a recent trip to San Francisco.  Pours a burnished golden bronze colour, very clear. Tiny streams of carbonation around the edge of the glass feed a light film of white head. Nice colour, nice looking beer all up.  good tropical fruits on the nose, the sweeter end of the spectrum though - mango and peach, almost. Also a real candy/caramel sweetness to it as well. Nice.  Taste is quite light. Pleasant sweet fragrant fruitiness on the front palate, then a subtle but pleasant dry hoppy bitterness. It's definitely not huge on the palate, but everything is nicely balanced. Quite dry on the finish, and refreshing. Mouthfeel spot on. Crisp and sharp to match the light hop bite.  A very drinkable pale ale. Really nicely balanced and very refreshing. Folks from the states come to Australia and often compare Little Creatures Pale Ale to SNPA, and I'm glad I can now do the same. It would be great to drink SNPA all the time, but I don't think I'm really missing out given I have Critters here in Australia to fill the gap.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,smanders,4.1,"I know Sierra has been around for a long time but I can't help but grab a case whenever I am confronted by it.  A - Copper colored with a strong 2 fingers of head.  S - Hoppy/fruity aroma. Ever-so-slight hint of diacetyl.  T - Consistent taste throughout the life of the beer. Flowers, herbs, and a bit of butter. Enjoy the bitterness!  M - Light and crisp. Never heavy.  D - A personal favorite. Easily drinkable - as is evident by the empty bottles strewn around the table. Doesn't take a lot of work to make this beer go down.  Serving type: bottle  I think this beer has it all; taste, drinkability, and it's affordable. A perennial favorite.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Exner83,3.23,"A crystal-clear, golden color with a subtle flowery smell. Above-average activity with a solid head and light lacing.  The taste is an estery, acidic fruitiness--lightly oily with a remarkable bite. This is a pungent, hop-favored brew. A stinging, slick finish caps off the quaff.  I'd prefer more malt balance. This brew's one note short of a chord: A little more hop-to-malt harmony, and I'd be dancing.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Very easy to drink.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,BigMike,4,This is a classic example of an American Pale Ale. Consistently a great tasting beer.  A deep amber pour with a good head and great lacing.  Has nice floral hops bitterness and is very well balanced. Good mouthfeel and finishes up clean and crisp.  One of my favorite session beers.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,soupyman10,4.23,"Well gotta say, I still have a soft spot for this guy. Definitely the one that got me into craft beer, and still a win over most of the stuff out there. Pours a delicious deep amber color with a colossal head that leaves outstanding lacing. Seriously, this beer looks amazing. Nose is solid - maltier than I remembered, but lots of swirling citrus and light floral hops as well. Taste is likewise. Strong and delicious, lots of caramel malt balanced nicely with the mildly spicy grapefruit hops. Feel is good, medium body with solid carbonation. Really, an excellent beer. Might have to switch to these more often if prices keep going up like they are.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,NCBeernut,4.1,"A: Light amber with decent semi-sticky lacing. Even after the head falls, it still leaves a nice sudsy layer behind.  S: Light floral, citrusy hops. A touch of sweet breads. Very pleasant  T: Perfect balance. Nice floral hoppy bitterness and complex bready malts all come in for the duration of each drink. Just a touch of tannins left on the tongue. A little over carbonated when it begins to warm but still a fairly smooth mouthfeel.  D: I can't stop. Give me a case.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,HalfFull,4,"From a 12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass, this beer pours a lovely opaque orange with a light carbonation that holds for quite some time. Lacing is light but ever present and renewed with each sip as the carbonation is released, as if on queue.  A light hoppy aroma with notable floral and citrus segues to a great taste and a very pleasant finish. This is one of the most consistent brews I've experienced, be it in the bottle or on tap. No more twist-offs though, as they went to pry off tops a year or so back. So don't forget the opener.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,theghost3,4.64,"Light orange appearance with a white head. Good amount of lacing. Smells of flowery hops, citrus, and yeast. Taste is bitter at first, then rather sweet, and again, citrusy--much like grapefruit. Mouthfeel is crisp, rather carbonated at first taste. This is a very drinkable APA. I've been drinking it for years and it's consistently great. This is just about the best APA out there in my estimation.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,OldYoda,4.35,"This has been my ""go to"" beer for quite some time. Poured from a bottle into my trusty Troeg's pint glass. A lovely dark gold with a nice 1 or 2 finger head and lacing that hangs around.  Smell is floral hops and some malt. Invites you to jump in - and I do.  Taste is exceptional. A great hoppy bitterness and well balanced on the finish.  I love the mouthfeel of this beer - it is just outstanding. Finishes with a crisp bitterness that invites another sip.  Drinkability is outstanding. Two or three or these is a great night. Along with Bell's Two Hearted this beer defines the gold standard for Pale Ales.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,argock,4.15,"Served on-tap in a clear pint glass at proper temperature at Escafe in Charlottesville.  A: Classic orange-amber pale ale with billowing off-white 1-2 finger head with rings as you get through the beer  S: One of my favorite smelling beers with tons of Cascade floral hops with strong pale and caramel malt contribution. It helped usher in the West Coast pale ale/IPA -- what else can you say.  T: Great balance of malt and floral and slightly fruity hops flavors. The malts and fruit flavor come to the front the brew warms.  M: Smooth with low carbonation and a pleasant bittersweet aftertaste.  D: Despite its strong floral hops and relatively high bitterness, it's a great beer anytime (and thankfully available nearly everywhere). A go-to beer anytime.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Ch1mpy,4.02,"I am reviewing this only a few days after I had their ESB which perhaps was even more to my liking.  Amber in colour and a centimetre thick off-white head. Relatively little carbonation.  Dry, saturated smell with aromas of hops and vanilla.  Taste is perhaps a little insipid, but with lots of bitterness. Aftertaste is very smooth bitter and the mouthfheel is excellent. Goes down very easily.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,AmishT,4.07,"Had this on tap  A - A brilliant gold. Lucid with a one-finger white head.  S - Sweet floral hops dominate the aromas of this ale. Love the nose on this, and any other APA for that matter.  T&M - Earthy hop bitterness is the most prevalent flavor; a little feeble, however. Light bodied. The mild hop flavors blend real well with the strong carbonation. Fairly clean finish.  D - Definitely a solid session beer here. Nice hop flavors, light bodied, low ABV...easy drinking, for sure",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Rayek,4.15,"Had this on-tap at the City Grille in Denver.  A: Copper color with good clarity and small carbonation bubbles. The white head was small, but retained nicely and left a little lace.  S: Lots of citrus. Most notably lemon and grapefruit. Some pine and oak qualities as well.  T: Malt hits first with a dry biscuit quality. Hops are well balanced and lemony. Wood flavors of oak and pine come through. Finishes quite dry, with a mild lingering bitterness.  M: Medium body with the right amount of fizz.  D: Great session beer. Pairs well with Tex-Mex food.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Cs1987,4.02,"Appearance - Light amber, 2 fingers of head which reduced.  Smell - Probably the strongest American Pale Ale smell I have experienced. Very good.  Taste - Very bitter, as expected. Tastes mostly of grapefruit, kiwi fruit and passionfruit.  Mouthfeel - Smooth, good carbonation.  Drinkability - The bitterness is a little too much for me to enjoy this as a session drink.  Overall - A very good American Pale Ale, but I still prefer Little Creatures Pale Ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,clayrock81,4.08,"Have had this numerous times, and I was at a bar and got a draft and had a pen on me, so I wrote a review. A rich, copper hue with a one-finger mountain head that dies so slowly, leaving a lace ring down the entire glass. A hop smell is prevelant, floral and citrus, with some malts in there and a light alcohol smell. Full-bodied and creamy - delicious - with a coffee/bread malt taste on the back, blended with some hops for a semi-dry backbite. Has a citric taste going down before the, like orange and maybe lemon (MAYBE) and some sweetness in it like there's caramel or honey in it. A quintessential microbrew to be enjoyed by everyone.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Beer-Zombie,3.7,"pours up good looking golden brown, nice white head. definite hop spicyness in the nose. also some subtle malt. there's a little bit of citrusy hop smell too. also taste of hop bitterness for sure. pretty light bodied, medium carbo, easy drinking, great session pale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,marc956,4.2,"A taste of ""home"" while away from it. (I spent many years in California before moving to Texas last August)  Good, clean, crisp taste, best cold obviously, enough of an alcohol volume (5.6%) that you can't down them nearly as easily as a lager, but a very good beer year round that can be paired up with most any kind of food.  Now if I can just find Lagunitas IPA down here I'll be such a happy camper !!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,BamaBeerBuff,4.07,"Poured on tap at the Mellow Mushroom in T-town.  A: Beer poured a deep amber hue with a decent sized white head that settled quickly and left light amounts of lace on the glass.  S: Very intense citrus and floral hop aroma with some underlying sweetness and caramel malt (in an APA?). A very intriguing, pleasant aroma.  T&M: It had an initial tangy hop flavor that was mellowed out nicely by the sweetness from the malts. Not a really complex or robust flavor, but it's not trying to be. A solid flavor profile. It's got a medium to light body with lots of carbonation that suits the hop flavors well. Finish is mildly drying and refreshing.  D: ""This beer drank pretty good, don't it?"" It's refreshing, well-balanced, and light--this is a great session APA. It's got a nice balance of hop bitterness/tang with malt sweetness, and is a safe choice. I could definitely kick a few of these back.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,irish53b,4.16,Poured from glass into a weizen glass. The deep golden color and ample head make this beer a poster child for appearance.  The smell is quite good floral and citrus notes with a cereal grain undertone. The taste reminds me of a grapefruit with a bit of sugar on top. The taste leans to the bitter side but a bready sweetness keeps it in check.  The mouthfeel is medium with a bit of creaminess to finish. The beer is highly refreshing and has fair amount of carbonation. The beer is dangerously drinkable and would pair nicely with a sweet dessert. My personal favorite pairing is New York style cheesecake.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

A: nice orangish color, nice lacing head good retention. the yeast doesn't cloud the beer which is nice. S: very woody presence, a sweet floral aroma like a sweet pastry T: Fantastically hoppy with a good kick, sweetens as the flavor matures.

140,276,dhd1491,3.8,"Throwing horseshoes over at my neighbors' I was able to sample three beers one right after the other. Good opportunity for comparison, as horseshoes is always a multiple beer event. Anyway, the three included my old stand by, Sweetwater 420, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, and Sweetwater IPA. In my estimation, the Sweetwater IPA was the far superior of the three. Better flavor and drinkability. I was struck by how similar the 420 and the Sierra Nevada tasted. However, I think I would slightly give the nod to the Sierra Nevada. Its taste is better than average, with hoppiness and sweet malt balanced. Some cloying straw taste that is also in the 420, but not so much. Interesting that before I started sampling widely from other beers recently, I didn't notice the straw flavor in 420. It was my favorite beer. Now, I would be pretty loathe to go back to it. Luckily, Sweetwater's IPA is so good that I can still give my business to that local brewery.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,lordofthewiens,4,"I could sit here and drink this beer all day long. Gold color, medium-size white head, little bit of lacing. Mostly malt aroma, a little bit of citrus.

S- Smells yeasty and malty along with good citrus grapefruit ester  T- Too much grapefruit to drink without food. Good flavor after you acquire a taste for it. Great with pizza and spicy foods  M- Feels clean and smooth with a bit of citrus pinch  D- Drinks good but the grapefruit is too much for me to pound this beer down,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

A: Pale gold in color, clear, with dense white foamy head at about 1/4"" but receded quickly to not much more than a fluffy ring.  S: Citrus hops are prominant on the nose, similar to a an IPA but not as pungent. A little agitation reveals more floral notes with the faintest bit of light malt.  T: This sure tastes like an IPA! A nice complexity of hops dominate the palate. Malts come in second, a distant second, this being a relatively dry brew. The finish quick and clean with just nothing but hop bitter lingering to the end.  M&D: A rather light and dry brew. Carbonation is fine but brisk and the brew has a smooth disposition. A fantastic beverage but I might have considered it an IPA. Especially if you like hops, grab one of these!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,MrIncognito,4.2,"A - Slighty foggy orangy/yellow. Thick white head, but only about a finger due to a weak pour. Constant rising bubbles.  S - Hops with orange and lemon zest.  T - Very smooth, light citrus taste at first followed by a smack by the hops. Hops are strong but not overpowering and well-balanced with the orange zest.  M - Smooth with nice tingly bubbles. More wet than dry but does have a drying effect after swallowed.  A very nice beer that is balanced and full of flavor. A great beer to have with burgers and steaks.

Tart, crisp, and refreshing.  Pleasantly hoppy and well-carbonated, light and refreshing in the mouth, and finishes with a nice bitter astringency.Stands up to spicy food great!

When I am back home (east texas) you usually can only find bud light which is right next to the nascar poster, but there is SN pale ale.  The mouth on this is one of hoppy goodness.

I buy from a pretty shady liquor store in MA and many times i'm disappointed by what is obviously the result of abuse in transit or by the store. That being said, Sierra Nevada is ALWAYS a good buy. i'm not sure if the resilience of the beer they brew (the ESB i buy there is always great too) or the high turnover and consequently low shelf life of this great brew.  appearance: light amber color, very clear with some lacing and it's well carbonated which leads to a good head that sticks around for a bit.  smell: hops baby! gotta love cascade for finishing apparently... i'm trying that in my next brew. i can always smell those hops which is impressive because the website doesn't mention dry-hopping with this brew.  taste: great balance of hops and malt. not too bitter either, just a nice piny/citrus taste that keeps me coming back for more! although it's only 5.6% ABV it seems like a bit more but maybe i'm just sucking the beer down at an incredible rate...  this will be my go-to beer for quite some time i imagine!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,rgb2807,4.08,"Pours a nice orange amber color. The smell is nice, but pretty tame, not very strong.  Taste is pretty exceptional, probably the best pale ale widely available. Nicely hopped, and citrusy flavors coming through.  This stuff is very drinkable, and I frequently pick this stuff up.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,righlander,5,"Ok, I drink this beer more than i drink any other so yeah, i could be considered a fan, but whatever. This beer is a staple in my fridge. and to me... this is the perfect beer for solidarity in a pale ale. Pours a light amber. Smell is citrus and floral...with pine. Man, does this beer taste good! It's perfect for a pale ale. the taste is a sweet-but not too sweet malt, but then the hops have their say. awesome hop bitter..The lacing is awesome.. it's like drooping rings.ABV is 5.6% so it's easy to slam a 6 pack. pretty much perfect for a pale ale on drinkability. i mean this beer is perfect for a pale ale in my opinion and it's really easy to find! they did some serious work on this recipe. An extremely awesome solid beer. In my opinion, if you don't like this pale ale...then you just don't like pale ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,codyw,4.03,"This is one of the best beers you can find at almost every gas station.  A: Nice medium amber color. Two finger head that quickly dissipates to lacing.  S: Nice floral and pine mix. The hops are definitely present, but not in an over bearing way.  T: Complex pine, citrus, and spice. The hops hit you at first, but then the malt character show you that the drink still has some body.  M: Not too dry, but has a fairly clean finish.  D: Definitely high. Not too expensive and easy to take down, with a great taste.  I like it with extra sharp cheddar cheese",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,PBBC,4.32,"This Beer is arguably the best pale ale in America.  From the first pour, the appearance is excellent, tiny champagne-style bubbles foam to a nice aromatic head on top of a medium-amber beer.  The grassy, fruity, citrusy hoppiness of the aroma is present, but balanced.  The taste is really what distinguishes this beer from other pale ales. A good deal of pales lack a strong malt backing to the level of hops, however, this beer has a deliciously clean malt body and sweetness to it without being overpowering.  Overall, if I had to choose 3 beers to drink for the rest of my life, this could very well be one of them.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,AshevilleSippin,4,"Short Version: Solid all around textbook American Pale Ale. Dry and pleasantly bitter with a crisp bite and nice structure.  Details: Seems like I take these things for granted any more. Fact of business, these are truly a gem of the mainstream beer world. I was desperate and had to buy beer at a backwoods grocery the other weekend. Choc full 'o Miller, Anheueser, and 40-dogs of malt liquor my options looked grim. But lo and behold at the end of the isle I found Sam Adams Lager and SN Pale Ale as the two token yankee beers in the whole store. Score!!! I took them both.  Got me to thinking how many times I've bought these and not rated them. Probably because I get busy, don't have time to rate, and always know there will be another sixer sometime in the future where I can knock out the review.  Enough jabbering, here goes with that thar review:  This is what I think of as a down-the-line America Pale Ale. They don't veer off the standard and try to get cute. It's a solid drink you can always count on.  Poured a medium golden amber color with a 2 finger rocky/sudsy off-white head. Clear as a bell. Light herbal and citrus on the nose. Lemongrass perhaps.  It's showing decent lace if you drink it quick. After a couple minutes the head drops to a thin film with splotchy white sidewalls. Carbonation is pretty busy. Vitals are good.  Flavor is dry and bitter. It's sporting some citrus, mild spice, and has decent medium malt body. Dominant hop-bitter rather than sweet. It's not a thick chewy beer but there is plenty of meat to separate it from imposters. There's a little grain on the finish. Aftertaste is grainy, dry and pleasant. I could drink these all day long.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,AKBelgianBeast,4.12,"The classic staple.  Pours a clear ambery orange with nice white frothy head. Smell is west coast hoppage with some spice. Taste is quite good with wonderful west coast hoppiness. I have some sorry ass IPAs (alaskan) with less hop flavor and bitterness than SNPA. Some good spice in the taste as well. Certainly a staple pale ale round these parts, and IMO one of the best in the country. This is always a go to, when you have to run in and run out of the store. Great beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,jeremyd365,4.35,Had it from a 22oz bottle.  Poured a light copper with medium head. Felt pretty carbonated and smelled flowery. It tasted slightly hoppy and was quite smooth. No bite at the end and very drinkable.  Had never had anything from Sierra Nevada before although I've seen it often. This great pale makes me want to definitely check out some of their other styles.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,jadpsu,4.18,"LOOK: Pours a light clear copper/amber with a great all white head along with some solid lacing. AROMA: I get some dank hops that dominate the aroma.

This is an outstanding Pale Ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Spidey13,4.6,"Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is the beer that first turned me on to craft beer two years ago. I had it on tap last night and decided finally to try to write a review.  In the glass, it is a very pretty, clear golden/copper color with a fluffy white head. Lots of lacing is left on the glass. The nose is very bright and floral with hops. Some citrus in there too with a bit of caramel underneath. The taste starts off with sweet caramel up with and them the grapefruity hop flavor and bitterness shows up and is fantastic! There are also some bready flavors in there and, while the beer warmed up, I think I tasted a bit of the alcohol underneath. There is a nice, medium mouthfeel with a medium/high carbonation. As for drinkability, I could drink this beer all day long. Never get between me and a SNPA. Do you hear me? NEVER!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,yelterdow,4.18,"The old standby... I can't believe after years on this site I've not yet taken a pen to paper with this guy. Bottled in mid-December 2007 and sampled on 3/24/08.  Served in a pint glass at just over fridge temperature.  Appearance- Pale orangey-gold, this offers a few floaties (looks like bits of hop leaves and yeast) with great action in the glass. The head crests at about three fingers, and remains puffy for several minutes after the pour. Excellent lacing that clings to the inside of my glass.  Smell- Sweet, juicy grapefruit exemplifies the nice Cascade hop aroma... a lemony twist appears at the end, it's all about the citrus here.  Taste- A perfectly balanced, mellow APA that is surely a great and consistent example of the style. The hops and malts are totally in sync, while the finishing bitterness dries the palate and leaves a refreshing taste.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Well carbonated but slick and smooth enough to really enjoy. The texture complements the bright hops and subtle malts, letting the flavors emerge fully. One of the most accessible, yet thoroughly satisfying beers with that beautiful West Coast hop kick.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,kwm13,4.42,"This one pours a nice golden amber color with a decent head on it.  Without knowing the name of it, one might guess that this could be an IPA because of the strong hops smell. The scent also brings out citrus.  Tastes like a great Pale Ale, really hoppy, little carbonation. Crisp finish.  A great offering.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,stephens101,4.1,"This was one of the first craft brews I ever had. I remember thinking how strong it was at the time. Let's see how it treats me now. Pours a clear copper with an off white two-finger head that sticks around a bit. Smells of hops with a tinge of citrus and pine in the background. Doesn't taste as strong as I remember, which is not surprising. In fact, it's not strong at all, but very drinkable. The citrusy hops are mellowed out with the malts and a bit of biscuity goodness. There's a fruity essence apparent as well, and a subtle sweetness comes forth after a while. Very smooth with not much carbonation going on. Great balance of taste and drinkability. There's a reason this one is so popular.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Starts out with a nice hop bite and finishes with a bit of malty sweetness and hops.  M: Great! Light, crisp and clean with the perfect amount of carbonation.  D: A great Pale and a great session beer. Nothing betther than having a case of this stuff while you are tending to the BBQ.

Pours a crisp copper with a substantial 1""+ head on a rough pour. lots of lacing. gradually reduces to just a thing bone white film. Beautiful coloring.  Smell is mild and not tons of identity here. a bit of a metallic smell. hint of malt. nothing overpowering.  Taste is good. Mild hops with good malt balance. fruit in the aftertaste. A pleasant taste, mild character. Slightly bitter finish.  Mouthfeel is very crisp and smooth  So easy to drink I could have this all day long. Love it. The original. I don't think I appreciate the hop character and bitterness as much as I used to when I was just a ""virgin"". But for some reason this is not as distinctive as it used to be, but still a very good brew. Like classic rock. You can do it over and over again and it is still great.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Lukie,4.37,"Poured a nice dull orange, with a soft smooth head. It's different to other pale ales I have seen.  Mmm... Grassy overtones, with green apple, and citrus fruits.  Hoppy characters of course, with grassy notes, citrus bitterness, and some fruity malts in the back. Almost a tanderine and grapefruit punch in the beginning.  Incredibly smooth, with low carbonation. Almost creamy. It's a fantastic drinking beer, and could easily become a great session beer here in Oz if the price was a bit cheaper.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

D: Excellent example of a Pale Ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Baileyuk,3.95,Poured a slightly darker Amber color. Had a perfect head and a good level of carbonation. The smell was great with a lot of hops and citrus. I was expecting a little more hops but I have been on quite an IPA binge recently so maybe I was affected by this. That said the general taste was pleasant and the beer was very drinkable.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,riboflavin88,4.03,"I really liked this Pale Ale, it poured a brownish-orange color with a medium-sized white head. Descent lacing down the glass. Its nose was full of esters, a flowery citrus scent with grassy undertones. Its taste was mild, which made for a very drinkable Pale Ale. Taste is much like its nose, primarily floral up front with some spicy and citrus flavors in back. Hops were definitely present, but not overpowering, very crisp and drinkable. I will definitely have this beer in my fridge on a regular basis.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,johnyeast,4,Pours a copper in color with a thick white head. Smells of hops and standard grains. A familiar flavor. The hops come to the forefront of this really balanced beer. Has a sweet finish. This was one of my first micros. Early 90's when I found Guinness. First introduction to hops. Definately gets a bump in review from nostalgia.

T = As with the smell, good piney and citrus hops flavors, good bitterness level, with a smooth fresh grain, fresh baked white bread malty balance, nice bitter finish.  M = Medium bodied, good level of carbonation, good mouthcoating.  D = This was my standby beer for at least a couple years running, but it's been a year or so since I've had it and I remember why I liked it. Just an excellent American Pale Ale.

Very subtle, but at the same time very fragrant. Sweet and bitter and everything you look for in a pale ale.  Taste is sweet at first, but in a hop way. The malt adds an unbelievable balance, and the hops add a very nice kick. Fantastic.  Mouthfeel is great, just enough carbonation to keep things tart.  Drinkability is astoundingly good, this beer is anytime, anywhere.  Overall, an absolute staple in my fridge. Beer the way beer should be, easy and flavorful.

140,276,Saunapoika,3.93,"A: Nice, dark, golden, clear appearance with initially, a 1-1/2 finger quickly receding head. Lacing continues throughout the experience.  S: Fruity, hoppy, clean smelling with just the slightest hint of maltiness.  T: Sweet up front, turning into a floral bouquet in the middle and a sharp, hoppy, dry, bitter finish. Very nicely done. The smell is very deceiving as far as the taste goes. Much more taste than the smell can deliver.  M: For me, a bit overcarbonated. A slight too much stinging in the experience for me. Had I let it sit for awhile, I think I would have been happier with it. Not bad though...  D: Not too shabby. I think with a bit less carbonation, the smoothness would temp me to quaff down a couple more of these things. I have really enjoyed the SN Pale Ale for a while now and have finally had the chance to rate it. Nice job.

140,276,BeardedBoffin,4.3,"The color of this brew is a beautiful merger of gold and orange. The exuded scents are an aromatic bouquet of floral hops, lime, orange and pine needles. Carbonated and nimble on the palate, the presence of hops is noticeable throughout. A slight sweet and bready character provides a nice balance to the hops. The beer finishes with dry bitterness. This is a very drinkable, pleasing and enjoyable beer, one for any occasion.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,jkdrummer,4.3,"Nice fluffy white head is strong and laces very nicely. Pours golden. Yeasty odor but the hops are present. Very mild and no bitterness -- fruity.

140,276,hdofu,3.75,This is a good beer if pale ale is your thing. It has a heck of a white foamy head on top of a knox blocks colored liquid. It smells heavily of hops. It's taste is of malt with a hint of grapefruit. The feel is a bit oily and a medium bodied beer. I'm not big on pale ales but this isn't bad and I would drink it again.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Slynger,3.98,"This one pours a bright amber-blond with a fluffy white head and a touch of haze.  First sniffs deliver fresh earthy grassy hops and lightly toasted biscuits in the morning. A little bit of light citrus shows up with deeper and warmer sniffs. Not too deep, but it's got everything the style demands.  Light and oily, refreshing and crisp taste. Very light sweetness of crystal malts and lemon. Relaxed biscuits and grassy bitterness stroll in with light earthy spice.  This is the classic american pale ale, and I respect it and dig it. A pleasure to consume anytime.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,becktone,4.22,"Decided I'd re-review this beer now that my palate has become a little bit more refined.  Eye: This beer looks great when poured at home, not so much from the bar though. I have a feeling that the sanitizers always kill the head. Dark gold-amber in color with a nice big head thats got great retention, not much lacing though. It looks great in the glass.  Nose: Ahhh, west coast. The aroma of this beer is sweet sweet cascade hops-little bit citrus, little bit floral...simply amazing. Also a good strong malt backbone to support this brew's hop aroma.  Tongue: First off I get some citrus from the hops that is quickly followed by sweet malts that balance it out and turn to a caramel flavor in the finish. Hop flavor is present throughout the entire beer, from first taste to finish there is hop character/flavor. A classic staple of the style.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Medium bodied in the mouth with appropriate levels of carbonation, just as it should be. This is a very drinkable beer, I could, and have, just sat around and drank this all day and night. This is a classic staple of this style of beer and I'll always be coming back to it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Gueuzedude,4,"Bottle Code 8003Y11126; Sampled February 2008 A vigorous pour yields a frothy, initially almost four-finger thick, light tan colored head that leaves some spotty lacing as it slowly recedes. The beer is a brilliantly clear, rich copper color that has a bright, copper color that almost has a metallic sheen to it when held up to the light. Soft citrus hop notes greet my nose and yield aromatics similar to grapefruit, orange zest, notes of creamsicles and light pine aromatics. There is a malt backbone here as well with aromas of soda crackers, toasty grain and biscuit like malt.  This starts out with a nice sharp hop bite and continues with a solid bitterness through to the finish. Grapefruit-like hop flavors and a touch of catty-hops show off the signature Cascade notes. Slightly herbaceous, with a definite pine-sap character, the hop character is just resinous enough to keep it interesting. Lightly caramelized malt and a drier biscuit / cracker note provide a malt backdrop to the hop character that is the real focus of this beer. This is quite quaffable, though it of course has a certain heft and body to it that helps to keep the hop notes in balance.  In the modern scene of hop overdosing, this beer can seem a bit tame, but it is so widely available & still delicious that it is always appreciated when I have this beer. This was my first craft brew experience back in the 90s and I remember how shocked I was at the flavor that greeted my unsuspecting taste-buds at the time; the hop character was just out of this world & an extreme jolt to my senses. I still remember that experience and I remember thinking how anyone could drink something like this. The funny thing is that it didn't stop me from having more and I became aware of all of the varied flavors that craft beer had to offer. Definitely a classic that will always hold a place in my belly.  Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Taste - It was surprisingly light which threw me off for a second fearing a watery beer, but then the hops come through and the carbonation is great lending to a very clean finish! Its an ale that you like to swish in your mouth, very crisp.  This would be a great barbecue or steak ale!

Not as ""big"" in assertiveness as some others....I really enjoy Summit Extra Pale Ale and would probably rate that a little higher but it's kind of like comparing apples to oranges...the Summit is a little more aggressive...this is softer and sweeter...both are very tasty...

140,276,steelcutoats,3.6,"I bought a six pack of this at Dawg's in Greensburg last night and figured I'd wait until today to write my review. I must say this is one of the best pale ales I have ever tried. I'm somewhat familiar with the Sierra Nevada line...I've sampled their IPA, Celebration Ale, and BIGFOOT Barleywine, respectively.  I poured one 12 fl. Oz. bottle into my trusty tasting snifter and almost immediately smelled the aroma of hops. This is definitely a more aggressively hopped A.P.A. There was a short head, only about a quarter of an inch, which eventually subsided. The color was a beautiful amber gold. As mentioned before the nose was sharp with hops and also a yeasty malt aroma. The taste was bold for an American Pale Ale.

The smell is hopped, not heavily so but certainly present, with fruit intruding occasionally. The taste is a bit more balanced than the nose and, combined with good carbonation, this is enjoyable--smooth, delicious, at times bitter but never overbearing.

140,276,skittlebrau,4.12,"I can't believe I've waited so long to try this one considering how it is a staple of the American craft beer industry.  A: An attractive beer. Amber brown like apple juice. Tall head or maybe I just poured it too hard. There was good head retention.  S: Floral hops and toasty bready malt.  T: Hop character takes over here with lots of flowers again, but there is a respectable malt backbone. Flavor is just slightly dry.  M: Thin.  D: Drinkability is pretty good. I tend to go a little slower on hoppy styles of beer, but this one had me reaching for another.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,SpencerT,3.53,"Pours a Crystal clear golden, almost apple juice in color. Clean scent of peach and piney hops. Good balance of hop and the sweetness of malt. A hint of citrus comes to you as the pint warms a bit. Clean and refreshing with very distinct flavors.

140,276,BMan1113VR,3.88,"Aroma is moderate pine hops with light molasses malts. Pour yields a small frothy barely off-white head with fair lacing. The color is a golden honey. Taste is fruity at first followed by moderate bitterness. Not watery at all. Light to medium body, slightly over carbonated. Quite possibly the king of common beers.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Deadstar,4,"SNPA  Look: Poured a very nice golden-brown, the head dropped down to a quarter inch of foam and then to some suds around the sides in about two minutes or so.  Smell: A little bit hoppy, my nose still isn't trained very well (as well as the words in my vocabulary to really describe what I'm smelling.) Some citrus scents in there too.  Taste: Very pleasant. I couldn't really taste any alcohol in this; it was also nice and hoppy. The taste lingers in the mouth after swallowed.  Mouthfeel: The carbonation tickles the tongue while the drink itself is quite lite.  Drinkability: I'd say this brew is quite drinkable. I'm most of the way through the 24oz bottle and I feel like I could drink more if I'd like to after finishing it.

140,276,SMark,4.3,"Had this on tap at Ruby Tuesday's because they did not carry Yuengling's. I will have to keep searching for a nearby RT's with the oldest breweries beverage.  The first one was served in a footed pilsner glass and I was immediately concerned if not confused. The second, yes I drank the first anyway, was served in a pint glass. Then I felt a little more comfortable.  The beer was poured in both instances with a nice white foamy head which left adequate lacing as it was consumed. A golden color was present.  Hops were noticeable with the aroma and taste. The beer was very clean tasting and assured me I had made a good choice as I have previously had this in bottles.  Bitterness stayed with me for a while and it was enjoyable the whole time.  This is a very good flagship beer for Sierra Nevada and I should try more of their offerings.

140,276,DaveUK,4.09,"Appearance - Light brown, strong bottle conditioned head.  Aroma - Perfumed grass and fresh citrus fruit hops, orange peel.  Taste - Juicy toasted malt up front and a soft hop bitterness that builds into a strong bitter and grassy hop finish.  Mouthfeel - Powerful carbonation delivering a bubbly creaminess to compliment the initial malt taste. Light to medium body (as expected) with only a little sweetness on the lips.  Overall - A crisp and hoppy pale ale. Good hop mix for aroma - complex and intriguing. It draws you into a sip. Alcohol is completely hidden. A well crafted ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,CrellMoset,3.92,"Poured from a 12 oz glass into a pint glass.  Appearance was orangey-copper, with a medium, white head with good retention. Lacing was average in volume and retention, and carbonation was medium. All in all, a very nice beer to look at.  Smell was very intense, with piney hops dominating but not overpowering a sweet malty backbone.  Taste was great, quintessential American pale ale. An initial burst of hops, with a good balance in the middle and a nice, piney aftertaste. No alcohol detected.  Mouthfeel was again decent, working well in concert with the taste - full, without being too full, with the mild carbonation dying down perhaps a little too quickly.  Drinkability is superb - this is a definite go to beer for me, and it's good that perhaps the most easily-available American Pale Ale is such a classic. A good introduction to the style, and a good dinner party beer. Cheers!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

MF:A light to medium body. The goes down very smoothly. D:Very easy to drink. Overall it's a great beer that is very well balanced.

Taste: A great balance of the fruity hops with malt in this one. I enjoy this balance that some Pale Ales seem to overdue to an IPA point. This is, in my opinion, the bar of a pale ale.  Mouthfeel & Drinkability: Excellent and smooth in the mouth with no tart or sour aftertaste.

Citrus and flowers at the same time.  Taste is a nice balance between some very juicy hops (Cascade?) and sweet malts.  Oveall, this is a great beer. One I consider the measuring stick for American Pale Ales. Highly flavorful and highly drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,roadhouse,4.3,"This has always been one of my favorite brews - a perfect balance between malts and hops, while still allowing the bitterness to dominate.  Pours a deep golden/copperish color with a nice one finger head.  Aroma is wonderful, like being inbetween a grapefruit orchard and a pine forest (is this possible?).  Mouthfeel is medium-light, not exceptional, but good.  Starts with piney flavors and finishes with citrus and a nice bittersweet end.  One of those beers where after you have had two, you just have to finish the whole six pack. As many have already said, it's a benchmark for the APA style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,MerkinMan,4.22,"This is the standard to which all APAs should be set.  Pours a nice deep coppery color with an explosion of citrusy hop aroma. While the hop presence is certainly the focus, it is supported with a nice malty backbone.  The mouthfeel of this beer is good, but nothing that really sends off fireworks. The head retains nicely.  This is a very drinkable beer if you are in the mood for an APA or IPA. People who do not like massive doses of hop goodness should beware, but you probably knew that already.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,tsbuttry,4,"One of the standard bearers of the craft beer movement, Sierra Nevada is a solid Pale Ale that is always enjoyable.  Appearance: Excellent amber color and head that retains well while leaving a nice lacing down the side of your glass.  Smell: Do I detect some cascade hops? (Intentional understatement) There's also an unappreciated malt aroma to this beer, picking up a lot of caramel malts on this one.  Taste: Quite good. The malts don't quite stand up to the hopiness, but it's not overwhelming. It has a good, clean finish, too.  Mouthfeel: No aftertaste, washes clean over the palate and nice heavy, but not too heavy carbonation.  Drinkability: If you have too many of these, it sits like a rock in your digestive tract. However, it's dry profile lets it go well with many foods and it's always fun to enjoy one or two during a ballgame.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Gambrinus1184,4.07,"Served in-tap at the Red Door, Watertown, Conn.  A: Poured a reddish, copper color with a thin head of tight white foam. Carbonation was a little on the sparse side, but probably just the keg here.  S: Smells of pine and citrus fruits, like grapefruit and lemon zest, with a whiff of sweet, acrid hops.  T: Tastes prickly and piney on the front of the palate, but washes over with a smooth malt and a dry hop finish. This is one of fthe more well-crafted pale ales out there, in my opinion. Great malt balance, but never treading on the hop profile.  M: Mouthfeel is slightly oily, but still quite clean and refreshing.  D: Despite being a little jacked up in ABV, Sierra Nevada's flagship pale ale is one of their finest, and a very drinkable brew.  Hopheads can mellow a bit with this sturdy, but never overbearing ale, while some may just relish the bitterness they rarely get with other shoddily crafted pales. Sierra Nevada and Dogfish Head really turned me on to hops, but you just don;t see DFH on-tap too many places around here.

Good finish, a very drinkable beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,ElGrecoVerde,3.07,"Poured an orangish yellow, which matched the scent and flavor pretty well.  A lot of fruit peel smells in this one. Kind of grassy, too. When I took a sip, my first thought was ""overkill"". The flavors are good, but there's no balance and they just sort of swish around with no where to go.  It had a good feel. Like some people say, good with food as it's pretty damn crisp. But it leaves me with too much of a fruit peel aftertaste to enjoy. Reminds me a lot of gin in that way. Finished a bit harsh too.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,trentley87,4.03,"My first experience with this beer was a delightful one. Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  A: Beautiful golden-orange, almost amber. Even a gentle pour yields a generous, fluffy, long lasting head. Very clear with constant bubbling. A very attractive beer.  S: Tons of aroma coming off of this one. Strong, but good. Very floral/citrus dominated with just a hint of hops. Appetizing.  T: Better balanced that the aroma might suggest. Bitter at the front fades to nice malty sweetness and the finish is all citrus (and maybe a hint of alcohol in the aftertaste). Very tasty. Less dominated by citrus than some other pale ale varieties I have tried.  M: Absolutely perfect for me. Mouthfeel makes or breaks a lot of beers for me and this one gets it right. Carbonation is right on and it is creamy without erring to the side of ""chewy"" or watery.  D: More please.

M: Just a tad thick, but otherwise fine and the carbonated fizz manages to perfectly compliment the hops in this one.  D: Very drinkable and compliments a meal very nicely.

Pours a crystal clear golden amber with a nice two finger creamy slightly orange head which subsides quickly to just a thin surface cover with minimal lacing.  The smell is a bit yeasty with a nice floral orange-citrus note. Nice actually.  The taste is sweet biscuity malt with a big bitter component, the two being nicely balanced. Hoppy but not to an extreme, with a touch of fruit sour orange-citrus component and perhaps a tad of caramel. As noted, nicely balanced with just a touch of alcohol warmth on the tongue.  Mouthfeel seems medium to me with just the right touch of carbonation.  Drinkability is quite good, it goes well with most foods and is one of my standard everyday beers. Might be a bit more bitter than batches I've had in the past, still very good and easy to drink.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Spikester,4.5,A 24 ounce bottle about 55 deg. F. Aroma is grassy some breadiness.  Finally a pale ale with perfect balance between hops and malt. I hate to rate a California brew above the Northwest micros but I must.  The pour yielded a huge head. The lacing was plentiful completely covering the glass. Good level of carbonation. Nice light amber color. Nicely hopped with a somewhat bitter taste but due to sweet maltiness the hops don't overwhelm. The aftertaste is just slightly bitter.  As far as drinkabilty is concerned this one could be habit forming. Am very much looking forward to trying the draft version. One of the very best of the style.  Another plus is the consistency. Always good and an excellent value as well.  My favorite Pale Ale at this time. If I were only allowed one beer for all time I guess this would be it.

140,276,littleshamrocks,4.05,"12oz brown bottle with no freshness dating. Served in a pint glass.  Pours a medium amber with about one finger of frothy white head. It has a very nice clarity and about an average amount of carbonation. When held up to the light it seems to have some small particles, possibly yeast, suspended in the brew. The head settles to a small crown on top and leaves behind impressive rings of lacing. The aroma is kicked off by toasted grain/bready maltiness along with a mix of a floral to perfumey to citrusy hop presence. Some fruity esters are here as well. The malt flavor is very solid with some spicy hops in the middle and an orange peel-like bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a somewhat coarse texture and lively carbonation. The finish is lightly astringent.  This beer makes me feel nostalgic. It was one of the two or three brews that really got me hooked on ""better"" beer. I remember back then being impressed by the hoppiness of it, but now, after being exposed to a whole new world of beers, I am struck by the balance in the ingredients. It is a supremely drinkable classic of an American craft beer. If Sierra Nevada would only put some kind of freshness dating on their bottles, I would keep this one around much more often.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,MDekker,3.9,"Pours out with a golden brown hue, some head (not a hard pour) and pretty continuous bubbling. The aroma is dominated by pine and hops. It's somewhat floral, too, with a slight fruity sweetness. The taste starts bitter and ends bitter, with a little sweetness in between. After a while it makes me think of apples a little bit. It feels fresh and clean, with a mild lingering aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fine; nothing offensive. In the end, this is a ""good"" pale ale, although every time I've had it I've never been as excited as some be are about it.

S - Slight grass/piney hint with a pronounced floral hoppiness and also dashes of citrus and small wisps of alcohol.  T - The hops hit your tongue first with a small punch, then the slight malt rushes in, with the gulp ending in an excellent second wave of hops a little bit larger than the first. All this mixed with little bits of citrus and faint notes of alcohol hiding in the background.  M - A smooth and uniform feel throughout, teetering on the edge between light and medium bodied.  D - One of the most drinkable beers I have yet encountered that actually has a really great taste.

140,276,TexIndy,3.23,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. It was a bronze color with a ton of yeast floaters. Decent carb, no lacing. It had a small beige head that settled into a partial film. The aroma was floral and hoppy with a grassy malt smell as well. Something in there didn't sit right though. It also appeared in the taste. It was a weird bitter aftertaste that I usually don't find in PA/IPA's. I love a good bitter PA/IPA bite but that weird aftertaste really hurt this one.

140,276,beersabound,4.02,A classic APA. A brilliant golden/amber hue flows from the bottle to create a snappy finger's width head that fizzles out a bit quick. Not much lacing or stickage either. Wafts of clean malt hang out behind a citrusy and slightly piny hop aroma. Clean hop bitterness with a slight sweetness are followed up by a dry finish. A well balanced session beer that is quite drinkable. The mouthfeel has a little too much CO2 and pops without much of a creamy or lucious texture.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Taste follows through with very clean crisp hoppy taste, although I don't detect citrus on my palate. Beer has a nice mouth feel and is very drinkable.

140,276,MiguelMandingo,3.58,"It is kind of weird that for as long as I have been reviewing beer, this one has somehow slipped through the cracks. I used to drink this beer all the time when I first got into ""better beer"", and for no particular reason, I just stopped buying it for a while about six months ago. I had some the other night at a bar, and it just didn't taste the same. A friend gave me this bottle to review, and I am having the same problem.  Poured a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance - It pours a completely transparent copper orange. It produced a pretty solid two finger white head and it left a bit of light lacing behind. It has constant stream of carbonation bubbles rising to the top of the glass.  Smell - Crackery/biscuity malts in the front of the scent, which then gives way to resinous grapefruity hops, and a slight hint of pine. This while the scent of this beer screams Cascade Hops, the scent is slightly subdued - it isn't as powerful as I remember it.  Taste - The initial flavor is very bready, with a tinge of a caramel sweetness. That flavor gives way to Cascade Hop flavor - slightly resinous grapefruit with the smallest hint of pine. There is slight bitterness that continues from the middle of the flavor and then plunges at the end, with the caramel sweetness rounding out the flavor. I remember this beer being far more dramatic - maybe my palate has changed, but this doesn't wow me like it used to.  Mouthfeel - On the thicker end of light bodied. The carbonation level leaves something to be desired, it feels kind of flat by the time it reaches my throat. It does, however, go down very smooth.  Drinkability - This is a beer you can drink the hell out of. It tastes pretty good, it is available pretty much everywhere, which is great because I will reach for this over any BMC, any day. It is an easy drinking brew. It is also one of the quintessential ""training wheel beers"" for most people that I know.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Body is perfect medium/low with the right carbonation.  Really not anything somebody can say bad about Sierra Nevada pale... I really don't buy it much anymore unless I am at a gas station and this is the only micro they have.... but writing a review makes me think about just how quintessential this brew is.... a classic if there ever was one.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,ChainGangGuy,3.52,"Appearance: Pours a clear copper body with a small, fizzy off-white head.  Smell: Grainy aroma with a small measure of caramel and a moderate citrus hop presence.  Taste: Sweet caramel maltiness mingles with the taste of toasted grains. Predominately citrus hops, but there is a pinch of pine in there, too. Medium bitterness leads into a bittersweet finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium-thin body. Medium carbonation.  Drinkability: Overall, a solid pale ale that's readily available and generally easy on the wallet.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,SargeC,4.43,"Appearance: Deep golden color with an almost perfect, off-white head. Carbonation lazily flows.  Smell: Crisp hops, sweet malt.  Taste: Beautifully balanced to highlight the ingredients. Good initial hop flavor that evolves into hearty malt flavors.  Mouthfeel: Medium body. Nice staying power with a semi-dry finish.  Drinkability: Classic American ale. Great session choice. Very refreshing and goes with everything.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,ifixufly,4.42,"Poured light golden amber color into a pint glass with 1"" of head that disippated quickly into a tight white lace around the edges of the glass. The aroma of the brew came across as hoppy with spicy and citrusy undertones when consumed. It has a smooth mouthfeel with very little aftertaste. I would recommend this beer and seeing that it is one of my fave's, I drink this beer all the time. So bottoms up!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,rxdrewthejew,3.41,"Here in LA, you can find this beer and almost any retaurant or bar that serves beer. And that is a good thing.  A: Mostly yellow with some darker orange hues throughout. Small and bubbly one finger head. A fizzy looking brew.  S: Mild sweet crisp smelling malts and a slight hop scent as well.  T: Grainy malt with just a touch of sweetnes. Ends with a bitter hop kick, not too strong but maybe more than other APAs. Pine hops seem to dominate the flavor.  MF: Very light and clean. Bubbly but easy to drink.  D: This is one of my standards because, as I mentioned, it's so easy to get just about anywhere. A great summer beer because it's light and not too dry. Certainly not my favorite beer, but it sure beats the usual restaurant selection.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,clemsonbrewer,4.3,Nice clear pale golden brew with a big head as a result of an aggressive pour. Thin head remains on top and lots of sticky lacing clings to the glass. Wonderful smell of spicy hops and malt. Starts out strong and bitter from the hops and then smooths out with some maltiness and finishes very dry and hoppy. What a wonderful brew.

Scent is surprisingly not as hoppy as I would have thought. Lots of fruit and a woody/grassy aroma I couldn't place. Palate is crisp, clean and very dry. Not as hoppy as a lot of Pales and IPAs. You get a slight hop burn on the tongue, but it's balanced enough to let the grapefruit and spices come through.

140,276,Bitterbill,4.18,"This one has escaped my review radar for long enough! ;^)  It pours from 12oz bottle a slightly hazy gold with a good 2 finger head of foam from the initial pour and it stays for the entire session as a solid 1"" layer. Good lacing to be had here as well.  The smell is hop dominant to the nose but it's fairly light.  The taste is hoppy with a mild bitterness of grapefruit and a touch of grass. I can just taste some malt, especially when I swish the beer in my mouth, but it's just there to cut through the hops a bit...not really to balance it as hop is king in this very tasty APA that I've enjoyed for many many years. This was actually one of my main gateway beers bridging the past of light tasting, oh so similar tasting brews to the present, where you can pretty much sample flavours all over the spectrum. And....after all these years, it does more than hold its own. This is a *classic* and rightfully so.  The mouthfeel is medium as is the carbonation and it finishes dry and has a nice bitter aftertaste that lingers on for some time. *Still* one of my favourites of the style and one I frequent often. It is that good.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,racer2k,4.97,"I first tried this beer back in the early 90's while enjoying some Grateful Dead shows on the east coast. This was well in advance of the craft beer revolution and many west coast deadheads would sell this excellent beer at shows. It has been my favorite ""go to"" stock beer ever since. Always plenty in the fridge.  A - Dark copper color, good solid carbonation. Thick creamy two finger head retention. Plenty of lacing on the sides of my pint glass  S - Moderate bitter hop smell with some hints of sweet malt. Very consistent smooth smell with a solid hoppy profile.  T - Very balanced taste with a moderate flow of hops and light malty flavor. Sweet but not syrupy sweet like some of the high powered IPAs. A bitter taste hits you in the middle of your swallow and there is a nice hoppy finish with hints of pine and floral overtones. A beautiful thing.  M - Good dose of carbonation with a moderate bitter hopped feel. Very balanced and not too thick.  D - Excellent session beer. That has a perfect balance beer after beer. This beer is positioned between a lighter hopped pale ale and a hoppier IPA in my opinion. I typically shy away from Pale Ales as many are bland and not hoppy enough.

Right away, I can detect the hops. They smell of citrus with a dash of pine. Very interesting smell. I also pick up on a bit of malt.  The taste was quite surprising. This beer, even though it is an APA, to me it was very balanced. Don't get me wrong, the hops was there but not as much as I thought it would be. I also picked up on the pine taste. Very refreshing.  Feels like a light to medium bodied beer. You can feel the carbonation as it rolls around. Very clean and crisp.  I'm not a hop head by any means whatsoever, but I found this drink really enjoyable and look forward to my next encounter.

Floral, like a bouquet of hops wafting smells.  M - Good mouthfeel, with good carbonation and a very clean, crisp feeling on the tongue.  D - Exceptional here.

The head has a nice thickness that goes down slowly and sticks to the sides of the glass nice a nice American Pale Ale. The aroma is really nice with a good mesh of hops and malt that prove to make a nice smelling beer. The taste is exceptional! Nice amount of hops that give it a bitter but light flavor. The malt is blended exceptionally with the hops and a nice fruity undetone finishes nice and clean. The aftertaste is beautiful and the carbonation blends the whole beer very well.

140,276,brewdoc75,4.3,"I decided I'd go with one of my all-time favorites for my first review on this site. I've had it bottled and on tap and it is better on tap, however I'm rating the bottled version here.  Appearance: Clear orange in color. 1/2 to 3/4 inch head w/ lively carbonation eminating from below. Quite inviting indeed.  Smell: A nice clean citrusy perfume. Doesn't scream of hops, but lets you know there's some good ones in there. There is a faint sense of malt as well, but not overly present.  Taste: Outstanding. This is what does it for me. The beer has a signature hoppy bite with a pleasantly clean citrus flavor that follows. A touch of light sweetness from the malt that brings you towards the end of the drink. The finale is a enjoyable bitterness which slowly fades until the next drink.  Mouthfeel: Light, refreshing, and always making my mouth crave more.  Drinkability: I usually have the option to buy this in 6 or 12 packs. I can never bring myself to by only 6 as I know that I'll end up going back to the store.  Overall, this beer is the reason why I am now an aspiring beer geek. It made me cross-over from the mass-produced garbage I used to drink so much in college. Now, as I try a multitude of other great craft brews, this beer is still there. I compare it to the original 3 episodes of Star Wars. I can experience it over and over again and never be let down.

The price, availability, and complexity (almost perfumy) aspects are a win-win combination and help to explain why it has steadily been growing in marketshare.

Taste is good, not great though. A good balance of malt and hops leaning towards the hop side. Moderate carbonation leaves a crisp and light feeling in the mouth with a dry and bitter aftertaste.

S - Faintly metallic aroma, not much to it, hard to distinguish.  T - Highly bitter initially yet quickly turns into an almost floral aftertaste. I could definitely taste the hops, but it was not overpowering.  M - As I said, the bitterness fades fast and it is actually much lighter than I had anticipated. Nothing too special here.

Given its ubiquity in grocery stores, gas stations, and bars without an abundance of craft beer, I'm pretty sure I've drank more of this than any beer in the world.  Pours from the bottle a rich, clear golden, light amber color, always looks appetizing. Good head that fades quickly. The aroma is mostly hoppy, floral and citric, but a light malt is noticeable as well.  The taste is a good strong blend of everything to look for in an American Pale: Cascade hops, pale malts, strong bitterness, a barely perceptible yeast undertone, and a crisp, dry finish. The hops are the star here, and while there could be more complexity, citrus, grapefruit, pine and spicy flavors flourish. If I'm putting together 3-4 beers to represent west coast pale ales, this is on the list.  Mouthfeel is very good, carbonation hits just right, and among pale ales its extremely drinkable.

Mouthfeel is good and easy going.I like it,its the easiest out of the SN familly.  I can remember buying a case of this stuff a year and some change ago and being very overwhelmed by the bitterness.Now it is a shadow of its self in my eyes.See what time does?This is a beer that I would drink if there wasnt any other type of craft beer there.Not because it sucks but just because its not moving me anymore.There are plenty of hoppier beers out there that overpower this.I dont know how to say that without dogging the beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Label is attractive, no freshness date but I like that SN has kept the ""micro-brew"" look despite being the second-best selling craft beer, behind Sams. From draft it's a darker amber, but thats for another review.  S- Cascade hops and citrusey, that about all I can make out. My sense of smell is kind of shot.  T- Mmmm. I'll admit, when I first tried this stuff I was put off by its citrusey and almost piney taste. Now I'm hooked, although I would say that its definitely best between the time you take it out of the fridge and 20 mins thereafter. Sorry I don't have a thermo.  M/D- Yummy? Mouthfeel is pretty light, and I consider it highly drinkable stuff. Put it this way, I gave it a 4. I rate PBR as a 5 on M and 4.5 on D. Guinness is a 4.0 on M and 5 on D.

I'm not sure if it was the batch or what, but this brew was much more flavorful than my first tasting. The most notable difference is the powerful grapefruit and citrus taste. My original review stated that I could not taste the hints of those flavors, but perhaps it was too cold the first time around.

Pours a beautifully clear, deep amber with a two finger, tightly packed head. Lacing is always left all over the glass. Aroma is piney and hoppy, with the cascade hops overpowering the aroma with its citrusey notes. Taste is very hoppy, but balanced well with toasted malts. Hints of caramel and toffe are noted, but mostly an herbal hoppy presence and a strong orange/grapefruit flavor. Exceptionally mouth filling, but easy drinking.

140,276,GRPunk,3.96,"24 oz. bottle in an imperial pint glass.  A- Pours a deep amber color with a medium off-white head. It had medium carbonation and decent lacing.  S- Lots of floral and piney hops with some sweeter malt tones to bring it a little closer to balance.  T- Definite hop flavor is present, but it doesn't overpower the bready tones. More in balance than the aroma lets on.  M- There's a bit of a bite and tingle from the carbonation and hop flavor.  D- I could definitely drink more than one of these in a sitting. I had a 24 oz. bottle and wouldn't mind putting back another 12oz.  Overall- I consider this a good representation of the style. With the availability as it is, it isn't something I need to seek out, but it's a good ""go-to"" beer especially when options may run thin.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,hustlesworth,4.3,"i can remember years ago when i had one of these and said ""YUCK"" haha oh how the times change...  A- poured a crystal clear topaz honey amber colorwith rising bubbles topped by 2in of dense soapy off-white head with medium retention leaving 1/8in ring and random fingers of lace stuck to the glass.  S- citrus, sourdough bread, yeast and malted milkshake, roasted nuts and grains, and spicy peppery herbal hops with a floral twang to it  T- orange, grapefruit, white wine, lightly caramelized malt, fruity powdery yeast in the middle. the sourness of the citrus and the herbal pine sap hop bitterness cuts all underlying sweetness down leaving a lingering spicy resinous woodsy leafy hop aftertaste with bread and biscuits way wayyy in the background.  MF- perfectly balanced in my opinion, resinous yet refreshing. finished nice and dry and went down like a silky champagne although unlike most champagne, the carbonation was at an ideal level.  D- uh yeah, i could drink this all the time and it's definitely my go to beer when i'm lookin for a bullseye, right up there with old speckled hen and sam adams boston lager.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Some nice citrus odors and a light malt/biscuit.  T) A light citrus note up front followed by a hint of grains and toast. Plenty of hoppy bitterness in the finish.  M) Medium bodied, good mouth feel  D) Pretty good overall. I had this in a blind tasting with Liberty Ale and Hopalicious (Ale Asylum), it came in third.

140,276,mshallah,4.4,"Pale copper to dark gold in color. Appearance of the head shows a well crafted brew as it's fluffy and creamy. Looks classic. Many bubbles of different sizes. Carbonation streams from the bottom of the glass in an absolutely clear liquid. Aromas of sweet malted barley and citrusy fresh dry-hopping. Label states bottle conditioning and it shows with perfect ale cabonation that's smooth and tingly on the tongue. Tastes of citrusy cascade floral hops with a sweetish caramel malt background. Malt becomes more aromatic and an apricot fruitiness comes through as beer warms. Here is the template for many an APA. Still tastes great after all these years. If it's not broke.... Goes great with spicey foods, BBQ, burgers, pizza, indian and seafood dishes also pair well.

140,276,jkrich,4.33,"12 oz bottle with no freshness date. Poured a deep gold to copper color with a two inch off-white head which dissipated leaving some lacing Noticeable northwest, piney hop smell with some bready aromas. The citrusy hop flavor attacks the palate with a slight caramel malt flavor close behind. I have enjoyed this beer numerous times and find that the flavors are subtly different each time. Becauset this beer is available nationwide, including grocery stores, I believe I have purchased a six pack that was probably past its prime, This made the malt flavor more prominent as the hops dulled from age. Of course, I have always been satisfied with this ale, though I would like to taste the pale ale at its feshest. Highly drinkable and could easily be a session beer even at the 5.6 % ABV.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,irishkyle21,4.32,"I start by saying I cant wait for this beer to make its way to Ontario. But for know I have to deal with having it once in awhile. Pours with a rocky white head, leaves behind some good lacing as it fades to a thin layer above the bright amber colored brew.  Smells of hops, citrus, some fruits ( grapefruit comes to mind but not as apparent as some IPA's or DIAP's), and a malt backbone.  The taste starts of with some citrus, malt, and has a great dry bitter finish. I would have this in my fridge often if only it were more readily available to me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,bcgoldtoe,2.56,"As one of the highest rated pale ales, I looked forward to a great balanced beer. I was, however, disappointed to see that the complexity I seeked was sorely lacking.  A= Solid, beautiful golden color with hints of amber  S= Better than a macrobrew but this was the first hint something wasn't right  T= Way overhopped. Needs more malt and fewer hops. Bitterness does fade into slight sweetness but does it have to take so long?  M= Excellent, one of the better balanced mouthfeels. Not too thick, not too thin  D= It's ok, once you get past the overpowering hops.  If you're not a fan of strong hops, avoid this beer. I do agree with the comment about this being Budweiser with hops. If you want a great microbrew pale ale without huge amounts of hops, I recommend Dogfish Head amber ale or Fat Tire.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,t0rin0,4.2,Have had this many times in the bottle as well as on tap over the past couple of years.  It pours an appropriate color for a pale ale. I say that because many times beers without color are beers without flavor barring of course belgian golden ales and tripels and some weissbiers. The foam dies off quickly which is alright with me because it doesn't taste much like the beer (the hops seem to stick out in the foam).  It has probably the best pale ale flavor I've had. It has a good amount of bitterness for a pale ale but that bitterness disapears quickly and becomes sweet and malty. Very drinkable and is well balanced.  I have always enjoyed this beer and always will.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,tronester,4.3,"Pours a golden orange, with a great, white head. Smells of citrus hops. Taste is very well balanced, sweet malt, with a good use of bittering and aroma hops. One of the best interpretations of the American Pale Ale out there. The version on tap isn't quite as good, likely due to this version being bottle conditioned.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Nothing spectacular, but no aspect of this beer is less than ""good"". The beer is amber with a decent off-white head. Lacing is pretty good, especially for the brief time that the head stuck around. Nose is pretty one-dimensional hops, but it's a nice dimension, with lots of citrus. Overall not that strong to this particular hop-head. Flavor is likewise very good, just enough bitter bite with every sip to make this even more refreshing. Rather floral, with an underlying light toasted malt flavor. Mouthfeel is a bit spritzy, but body is better than decent and quite smooth. I don't think I've ever sessioned this beer, but it is quite drinkable. The carbonation sneaks up and I tend to feel full after a couple.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,RedChrome,3.97,"A crystal clear golden orange blend. One third of an inch white colored head retained about a minute. Only a handful of small carbonation bubbles. Thin sticky lacing ribbons.  A super sweet malt aroma lies right on top of the hops scents. Light citric blend of hops aromas comes and goes. A decent blend, with surprising grain scents in the style.  Strong hops right up front in the taste. A definite citrus sense to the hops with a faint pine note underneath. Malty sweet flavors of brown bread are subdued but noticeable.  An average thickness to the body which clings on the sides. Carbonation pop in the finish.  A very nice choice in the style. Great beer to go with a sandwich. A solid choice to always keep on hand.

140,276,whiplash3825,3.65,"*Before I start, I want to warn that I usually drink wheat beers and therefore am VERY sensitive to hop smells and flavors!  Hard-poured a nice copper with a four-finger head which dissipated to a lasting cap w/ very nice lacing.  Smell was all floral citrusy hops, which always reminds me of the bergamot in Earl Grey tea.  Taste has a nice hop bite with a clean finish. All I can taste is hops, but the bitterness gets less noticable as you go. Very citrusy and floral. This reminds me a lot of Sweetwater 420 Pale Ale. Probably very typical of the style. The taste lingers, but not in a bad way.  Good mouthfeel, though not nearly as ""chewy"" as my favorite style which is German hefeweizen.  Very drinkable in spite of the higher ABV. Once I get adjusted to the big hop flavor after a few swallows I can drink 'em pretty easily.  Overall, a very good,easily found brew.

Up front is baked biscuit and dough that transitions into some fruity ale ester flavors and then the world famous pine/citrus hop finish.  Mouthfeel is fine and drinkability is quite high due to the nearly perfect balance. What can I say? Simply a classic and my first beer experience period and one that has converted countless.

S: A nice balanced hops smell comes through, hints of citrus, hints of pine, hints of resin. Not overpowering like an IPA, but really pleasing. A little bit of sweetness rounds it out nicely.  T: This beer shines in the taste department. Nice, smooth bitterness upfront with the hops followed by a slightly sweet malt, leaving behind a well-balanced yet nicely bitter aftertaste. No real alcohol presence.  M: Nice and smooth, goes down easy.  D: Very drinkable. This was the first pale ale I ever really started drinking frequently, which led to my love of the IPA and DIPA style. Highly recommended.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Budro,4.92,"A: Pure copper, burnished like fine cookware, nearly transparent in its glassy clarity. On top of this, a full two-finger head, foamy and creamy in appearance. (Note: Every SN I've ever poured has been perfectly clear, in spite of the label's warning that you might see some yeast from the bottle conditioning in your glass. I'd love to see some yeast in there.) S: The nose: Sweet mist rising from rain-splashed stone. Seriously. The hops' pine and ctirus notes are squarely in the background, lurking like a distant fog. The overall impression is one of mineral purity. T: The suprisingly thin head, lightly flavored, tastes pleasantly of sour yeast. The beer proper boasts a bitter front and lingering sour back in perfect balance; as the latter fades from the palate, it complements the hop attack of the former. The finish is mineral-dry initially, but as the beer warms, the dryness of the finish becomes reminiscent of a sourdough roll. Nice transition. Furthermore, the beer yields underlying apple notes as it warms. No real sweetness, but allusions to sweetness in every swallow. It's subtle and complex. M: The thin head disappoints; it appears creamier than it is. The tingle of carbonation is bracing but not overwhelming; it doesn't burn with the first swallow, and it mellows agreeably as the beer warms. Don't let it sit too long, though; when the beer gets too warm, the last couple of swallows are stripped of good flavor and feel almost tepid on the palate. That's just nit-picking, though. This is an exquisitely crafted brew. D: I could drink this all day.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,LittleCreature,4,"Appearance - 3.5 Poured a finger and a half of thick off-white head which quickly reduced to a thin layer. The colour is a nice, slightly cloudy orange-brown.  Smell - 4.5 Hmm, really interesting! This actually has a slightly Belgian smell to it, like you would find in a Belgian Pale Ale (perhaps it is the highish ABV). The usual flowery hop and fruity (mostly citrus) smells from an American pale ale, accompanied by sweet malt, spice and a smooth alcohol.  Taste - 4.5 Yum! This is a seriously tasty mouthful! A strong and bold flavour, starts with smooth malty sweetness, almost cake-like, which gives way to a strong hoppy bitterness and a tart orange taste, and a dry finish. I was very sad to finish my glass.  Mouthfeel - 4.0 Feels really thick in the mouth, quite dense and heavy, almost creamy. Carbonation is low to moderate. Became near-flat a little too fast for my liking.  Drinkability - 4.0 Not as drinkable as Little Creatures Pale Ale, mostly due to its higher ABV. This is bloody good stuff though, and I could definitely go a second (or a sixth) in one sitting  OVERALL - 4.2 I was expecting this to be more similar to Little Creatures Pale Ale, but I am really glad it wasn't. I've never seen this in Australia before, and am hoping to stumble across it again. It was expensive to buy (nearly twice the price of LCPA and not appreciably better) but definitely worth it. A fine beer in its own regard.  Re-review:  On all subsequent tastings, I don't think SNPA is as good as LCPA. It is the benchmark beer of its style and very drinkable with pleasant bitterness and a dry finish. However, it lacks the fresh hoppy character of the best beers American Pale Ales.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Soft aromas and tastes of lightly toasted malt and honey. Finishes cleanly with a brush of the hops. Tastes travel well. Light-bodied mouthfeel. Continuous carbonation adds to the head, although it doesn't bite the tongue. Not the most powerful flavors, but a well-balanced session beer.

I poured the bottle into the 16 oz plastic cup to produce a 1"" off white head over an amber colored beer. The head dissipated to a thin cap over the course of drinking this beer... lacing.... somewhat (even on a plastic cup).  The aroma was of floral hops with a bit of a sweet/malty profile in the background.  The taste: fairly good. Good hoppy taste but not overbearing. The malt came trough to balance this out.  Mouthfeel: nothing offensive hear. appropriate carbonation and not too thick... a good ""gateway beer"".  Drinkability: decent beer, best I could find at Game Day... nothing special.

Not really much to the smell besides the hint of hops; the taste was slighly malty and a bit bitter. Pale ales are not my favorite, but this one was enjoyable.

Maybe my expectations were too high. It was a good beer. Crisp and clean but there was nothing special about it. I smelled some hops but not what I would have expected, and I tasted hops but nothing like I would expect from something with the words pale and ale in the name.

Taste- Opens with a bit of a bite, nothing harsh, but the hops assert their presence, this blends quickly into undertones of citrus, and then finishes with a smooth fruity bouqet.  Mouthfeel- Pretty clean on the palate, taste lingers quite a bit but not in an unpleasant way. Taste just sort of fades out gracefully, well balanced.

The almost bread like quality comes through in the middle followed with lemon like bitterness aftertaste.  M:Nice and smooth. Definitely good enough to keep you drinking.

140,276,AlephNull,3.79,"One of my favorite beers that seems to be available everywhere. When I want a hop-monster, this is the way I tend to go. The bar I got this from may have had some ambient scents that were washing out the flavors, because I know it has a more robust smell than it seemed to that day.  A - Pours a warm amber with the head poured off. As I drink it, the head leaves nice round lacing rings.  S - Not as much as I expected (as above) but I smelled no real discernible malt, but there's definitely some grapefruity hopy scent. Maybe a little piney-ness.  T - Oh yeah, that's the great pacific northwest hop beer we all know and love. Grapefruity hops from start to finish. Not a lot of variety to that flavor, and the malts are definitely overwhelmed. There might be a bit of a bready malt there, but hops dominates.  M - The heavy grapefruit hops emphasize the carbonation which helps the refreshing nature of the beer. Not quite watery, but definitely not creamy, a solid body.  D- I find it very drinkable, but if you're not a fan of those NW cascade hops you'll hate it, so I'll have to give it a slightly marginal rating, but as I said, I love it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Carbonation is pleasant and not overpowering, it leaves a bitter aftertaste that makes you want more without taking away from the thirst quenching attributes of this beer.  This is a great summer and fall beer and cheap enough to have on a regular basis if you're on a budget.

140,276,onthefarside,4.48,"I've had this one on several occasions. When I was first getting into beers i thought it tasted a little funny, but now that my taste for beer has matured quite a bit, this beer is great for me when I run out of Dogfish head and can't get to the one place that sells it in Albany. There are two bars so far that I know of in the Albany area that have this on tap. (I dont go bar hopping too much, stick to the usual place) My Place in Delmar and Hollywood down on Lark St in Albany. about $4 for a 16oz draft. On to the beer.  Appearance is a nice dark brown that when held to the light is more of a dark caramel. Depending on the bar tender you either get about 1 in head to almost no head. Out of the bottle about 1in with an average pour.  Smell- Some floral hops, not as strong as IPA but enough to know its going to taste great. Some malts and general pleasantries with this beer.  Taste- where to begin, a great almost sweet malt taste that makes the perfect transition to a slightly bitter hops. Mixed with wings and other typical bar foods, it can mix with other flavours to please your pallete. There are so many other flavours in here that i just can't pull out at the moment.  mouthfeel- when cold it has the perfect effect on your tounge, a perfect amount of carbonation, more than a usual IPA but less than a crappy macro. Good for drinking at a bar with freinds or for washing down a meal.  Drinkability- Definately my session beer at the bar. with 5.6 alcohol cont, it's rather high for a beer you can easily find in a grocery store. For a college party, get something cheaper, at 7-9 dollars around here it can be pricey for those of us in a pinch, but when i want something good and can't get my ass to the bev cent.

140,276,josiahschlender,4.45,"I've been a little disappointed with the last few APAs I have had recently, so let's see if this one does any better.  Pours an attractive clear golden color. The good, off-white head leaves quite a bit of light lace before gradually diminishing to a film of bubbles on the surface.  Lots of good aromas floating upward. It's very floral and sweetly citrus. I also notice some toasted grainy malts.  Taste is really well balanced. The malts and hops interact so well, both come on strong yet neither take the stage too much. This is a great tasting beer. The malts have a wholesome, grainy taste to it. Kind of like a perfect golden lightly buttered piece of toast. Long lasting aftertaste finishes clean.  The wholesome, balanced taste is well complimented by the smooth, medium body. Again, balance comes to mind. It's a pleasure to drink, I'm wishing I had another. Very refreshing, very versatile. I could see this beer pairing well with a lot of different kinds of foods.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,InsolublePancake,4.12,"A- Nice clear gold with a decent head.  S- Ahh, great smell. Fantastic use of Cascade hops gives this beer that great characteristic grapefruit aroma. A substantial malt sweetness backs the hops up nicely.  T- Tart citrus from the hops predominates and is backed by a nice grainy malt. The beer finishes with a moderate bitterness and a slight honey-like sweetness. Quite refreshing.  M- Light to medium body with a good carbonation level. No complaints.  D- The ABV is a little too high for this to be a session beer. Still, I can easily drink a couple of these at a time, maybe more if I feel like it.  Pretty much the quintessential American pale ale. There's hardly any denying that. There may be better examples out there, but no beer that I've had so far embodies the characteristics of a classic APA like this one. Always a great fallback beer to boot, as many places with so-so beer selections will have this.

140,276,Slar211,3.75,"12 oz. bottle from the B-Side Liquor Lounge on Coventry, Cleveland Heights, Ohio.  Appearance: Pours dark golden, almost amber, into a pint glass. Thick ivory head stays and clings well.  Smell: Sweet malt and fragrant hops, an inviting nose.  Taste: Zesty hops reveal herbal and even fruity notes, very complex.  Mouthfeel: Medium body that finishes dry on the palate.  Drinkability: A solid ale, could have this again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,WaveRebel51,4.5,"Hands down, this is my favorite beer and is always in ample supply in my fridge.  This is one of the few beers where the bottle is much better than the tap. The layer of brewer's yeast from the bottle really adds to the appearance. The aroma between draft and bottle are about the same, but the taste and mouthfeel from the bottle version tops the draft. The hop-flavor comes through much better in the bottle.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,jdoncbus,4.05,"12 oz bottle - poured into thick, pint glass. Rich orange-amber with a little lacing and active carb...  Floral hops lean foward with a mellow malt foundation. Faint biscuit with pleasing balance - could make out some barley.  As mentioned above the taste is one of balance considering the love of hops with APA's. Hits the mouth with a toasty malt and rounded out with a sour-bitter finish.  Mouthfeel finishes with a nice bitter pucker which inevitably demands another drink. Quite nice.  It's hard not to praisethis beer. I have enjoyed it for years yet have never written a review. When I need a break from IPAs, Imperial and double IPAs there is nothing like a Sierra Nevada. It's one of the original micro's and incredibly convenient since its sold almost everywhere. A session beer she be.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

S-Citric hops dominate the nose, slight sweet bready malt as well  T-highly grapefruit hopped with a perfectly balnced ammouont of sweet bready malt. Slight ammount of malt is there to give it alot of depth.  M-totally medium bodied in every sense. This is a classic, slightly chewy with a perfect medium carbonation.

140,276,Tomas77,4.15,"In the past this beer has been one of my favorites. Very good looking beer. Great for the summer although a little strong for any kind of a session beer. Orange rhine comes to mind in the aroma and taste as well. But floral and earthy scents are predominate. Bitter in the finish but not overpowering. Bready, buiscuty malts show up first on the palate then the hop flavor and bitterness, later. Great drinking beer anytime of the year. Mild enough but too many will knock you on your ass, so be careful. Just a great beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

S: Piney Cascade hops predominately.  T: Pine and cilantro upfront from the Cascade, along with delicious bready malt which makes its true presence felt as the beer warms up.  M: Very good, the beer is well built, crisp and medium bodied.  D: Very good, low in alcohol, excellent taste makes for a great drinkability.

And then on my first few sips the mouthfeel was a bit acidic, but that was maybe more to do with the strong alcohol - 5.6%. Once it settled down it tasted quite nice, with nice carbonation and flavour.  I cant help thinking it was better when I had it on tap in the united states.

A fairly weak odor, wet grains with a distinctive floral hop flavor. More subtle than I would expect.  The taste is far richer with an initial sweetness that yields to complex hopes and finishes with bitter hops. Well balanced with a good initial bite that finishes smoothly.  The mouthfeel is smooth with nice carbonation.  I can see having a few and in the past have.

140,276,smcreator,4,"Overall, this is a solid and well-rounded beer. It smells and tastes as expected, but not more than expected (which is why I rated it straight 4s). Since it meets all my expectations I feel that it is probably one of the more established APAs available, as it is not trying to be anything it shouldn't be. Great beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,largadeer,3.43,"Appearance: Slightly hazy amber, good color and head retention.  Smell: Hoppy, floral, a touch of pine and citrus. A metallic character is also noticeable.  Taste & texture: Very bready malt, earthy and metallic, lots of pine in the hops. The malt character of this beer has never impressed me much, though the cascade hops give it a nice finish. I think I'd enjoy it a lot more with a stronger hop presence. The mouthfeel is fine; a bit creamy but not particularly heavy, medium-bodied and moderately carbonated.  Drinkability: While this seems to be the session beer of choice for a lot of people, I personally find it difficult to drink more than a couple of these. I get very sick of the malt flavor after a while.  Notes: This beer is a staple of craft brewing, probably the single most common craft beer you'll find on the west coast. It's a solid pale ale, nothing incredible and a bit overrated in my opinioin, but nonetheless a good representation of the style and a decent gateway into craft beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,afinepilsner,4.1,"on-tap  Sierra Nevada Pale ale was a nice orange-amber color with good clarity. It had a white head with good retention and left some lacing behind. The aroma was cirtus hops and some light malt. The taste was more hops than malt with a little bitterness and hoppy dry finish. It was medium-light in body with good carbonation.

S: Big bready aroma upfront with hints of flora hops hinding in the back of the inital bread and biscut aroma.  T/MF: Lots of big biscut flavor upfront coupled with nice bubbly carbonation and a decent hop bite. Not quite as juicy as other APAs I've had (Alpha King for example) but this is a nice change of pace. Still I feel that the bread and biscut flavor dominates too heavily for my tastes, not quite as smooth and leaves a bit of a dry aftertaste.  D: I held this beer up against Alpha King because I wanted to know the differences, and boy are they evident.

S - Classic pale ale, with floral notes of tea rose, honeysuckle, and malty sweetness.  T - Never disappoints, with a nice balance between the sweetness of the malt and the bitterness of the hops.  M - Nice to roll around on the tongue, medium body with a little bite from the carbonation.  D - This ale is so balanced between sweet and bitter that I could drink it all day and night. Definitely a session beer for me.  Thank goodness that Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is so readily available in bottles and on tap!

T: The taste of grapefruit and a hint of apple are followed by citric and pine hops that give off a pleasent bitter bite. Sweet balancing malts chime in with a bread like flavor.

This one ranks on my all time favorites list- I am never sick of this stuff and it's always as refreshing as it was the first time I had it.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a standard pint glass. Poured a burnt yellow/copper/orange color. No lacing- small amount of head- hints of malted barley and big hops- floral scents and even a hint of grapefruit.  This goes down as smooth as anything- as a reviewer said previously- not sessionable at 5.6% but there have also been many a nights where these beers have been consumed at a high volume by all parties involved.

Pine"" with a great resinous and grapefruity taste. And it is not at all overly bitter so there's got to be some malt to balance it out, but the malt taste isn't really there.

Coded ""7082X"", but no visible expiration/best by date.  A: Warm golden-yellow & crystal clear. A little rising carbonation but mostly still. Poured with a huge 3-finger head, slightly off-white. Its consistency was crackling and rocky, finally settling to about 1/4"" of bubbly cream. Nice sticky splotches of lace and rings down the glass.  S: Pleasantly malty, a little biscuity, a touch sourdough. Hops are clean and grassy/citrusy.  T: Grain maltiness is blanketed in spicy & lemony hops. Very well-balanced flavors, melding sourdough bread maltiness with zesty bittering hops. A well done APA...  M: Found this to be just a little thin and lacking in carbonation in the mouth.

As others have noted, this really is the quintessential American Pale Ale. I know whenever I think of a pale ale, this is the beer that comes immediately to mind.  The beer pours an impressive copper orange amber color, with very decent head retention and good lacing. On the nose.... mmm.... the sierra nevada pale aroma. There's nothing quite like it. Noticeable hops and malt perfectly intermixed on the nose, with a hint of orange/citrus and ginger. The beer is mouth watering, and as always, I can't wait to take the first sip. On the palate this beer is just delicious. Again, it seems to have the perfect intermix of hops and malt, with just enough hops to keep the beer refreshing and not too sweet. In combination there is a very forward fruitiness to this beer, a mix of orange, cherry and apple I think. The beer finishes very crisply, and always leaves me wanting to take the next sip. I find this beer to be amazingly drinkable for a beer with so much flavor, and I'm not afraid to admit that at one time I could go through an entire 6 pack by myself, or would pound down 4 or 5 pints at my favorite sports bar.  I still remember the first time I encountered this beer (many, many years ago in California). I knew right then that my days of drinking miller, coors and AB products were over forever.

140,276,brdc,4,"Out last night in a place with little good beer offerings, I decided to have a good solid standard such as this pale ale, even though pale ales are not my favorite. I had a pleasant surprise (never had it on tap before) Rich golden colour with a white head with good retention and lacing. Smell is, as expected, hoppy, mostly citric fruits, but flowers and some malts provide a nice balance to its nose. Creamy, smooth, it has ample hoppiness but it also has a malty backbone and mild alcohol warmth that does balance it quite nicely. As I mentioned, pale ales are not my favorite style, and I generally think they are, for my taste, a bit unbalanced, and that includes the bottle version of this one. However, this fresh tap version (they rolled it in front of me) is better balanced than the bottle version and most pale ales I had.

That isn't a knock against the beer either, the smell is right on for a Pale Ale- though I've always preferred a more crisp smell.  Appearance, well I dunno I didn't pour it, and I frankly don't care what it looks like- it is all about the taste.  Taste, a yeasty almost dark lager taste. I prefer this taste to the sweet taste I've experienced with other Pale Ales.  Mouthfeel... this is where Sierra Nevada turns me off. The bitter, almost copperish, aftertaste coats your mouth. I'm not sure if it is the yeast or what, but something about it just stuck in my mouth. For some this is a good thing, but I prefer a rich tasting, yet crisp, beer.  Drinkability, with a meal this would certainly be the beer of choice. The aftertaste would be neglected, and the taste would compliment a steak better than A-1 (and yeah, A-1 it's that good).

Good clean citrus hop scent with a biscuit malt backbone.  Crisp, citrus hop flavor with a subtle hint of sweet, doughy malts. More hop presence than most pale ales, but it is done very nicely.  Very easy to drink and not heavy at all. Great session brew. Not sure why I always looked over this one when I saw it on-tap, but that won't happen as often now.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,CFbeermaker,4,"Poured a beautiful clear rich golden color with a 1/4 inch off white head and frothy lacing down the glass as you drink. It has a real nice scent of grapefruit and floral hops. Tastes good. You get a real nice citrus flavor with barley malt and a floral hop finish. This beer is really light, smooth and very refreshing. This is a great beer for those beginning their hop journey. I think it would be great on a nice summer day.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,jdg204,4.12,"Picked up a 6 pack so that I could finally review this classic which I've had many times before and is one of the reasons I got into better brews.  Appearance - Lovely bronze color with a nice white head and lots of little fizzy bubbles.  Smell - Very aromatic citrus smell with some nice spices added, very nice balance.  Taste - It's most likely the excellent amount of hops that sets this brew apart from other pale ales, the healthy portion and the nice crisp bitterness comes from it which is very well balanced with a nice subtle citrus flavor.  Mouthfeel - Very consistent texture with an excellent aftertaste that leaves the drinker very satisfied.  Drinkability - I have to say this brew just impresses me the more and more Pale Ales I drink. I find the catagory to not be overly impressive but this one of the originals still stands out as one of the elite and makes for an excellent brew with a spicey meal.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,matsputis,3.87,"Golden amber with some orange  It smells like a big grapefruit. Also has bready-biscuit aroma - a nice balance of hops and malts.  A strong citrus taste with bitterness starts it off, followed by the malty presence and a nice crisp aftertaste. The bitterness stays for a little bit.  It has a very nice crispness to it. Clean flavors  I especially like the aftertaste, and the bitterness gives it a nice kick. The grapefruit flavor I can deal with, but it's a bit strong. I'm fine with just one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,prototypic,4.15,"Appearance: Pours a transparent golden color with a one finger head. Decent retention and light lacing left down the mug.  Smell: Combination of floral hops and some citrus notes. Citrus scents are primarily orange, mango and a slight hint of grapefruit. After sticking with it for a few, it has a bit of a grassy smell.  Taste: Predominantly, it has a grassy taste with strong, bitter hops. Citrus tastes are detectable, but they are slight. There's a slight malty taste to it. But, the hops are definitely stronger here.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied and very easy to drink. The 5.6% abv really propels this to a session beer. Overall, this is one of my favorite all-around beers. Especially for a session. I expect that most here have tried this.

140,276,BretSikkink,4.1,"Golden-orange pale ale, some haze that takes off once it warms, almost-white lacing chills on top and gets itself all over the glass. The nose is biscuity grain, some spicy hop leaf, a little floral but citric as well.  This is a very smooth pale ale, there's a good pepper ester hop presence, but backed up by a solid bread malt sweetness. The finish is a little dry, some more sweet malt. There's a definite citric hop twang, a little fruity.  Very solid APA. Definitely a paragon of the style. Recommended, it goes well with many dishes and is welcome for many different events.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,MMansfield,4.17,"Bottle courtesy of trevorwideman. Thanks.  Appearance: Pours a very slight hazy pale amber colour with a foamy two finger white head, leaving lots of lacing and decent retention.  Aroma: Lots of floral hops and loads of citrus. A tiny bit of honey, and biscuit malt, but heavy on the hops.  Taste: Hop forward with a bit of spice. Small amount of pine. Grapefruit like bitterness in finish.  Mouthfeel: Plenty of body, creamy and highly drinkable.  Final Statement: Wow, this is different from the pale ales i've tried, and certainly one of the best. Very impressed with this West Coast Pale Ale. Highly recommend.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,DoubleJ,3.8,"One of the three major craft beers you'll find at many establishments on draft (the others being Fat Tire and Boston Lager), I got this at Famous Dave's BBQ when I was in Fresno this weekend. Paired with BBQ beef tips, on to the beer:  What's to say that hasn't been said? It's a west-coast classic with it's own unique beat. Typical of American styles, it leans towards the hoppy profile, with a grapefruit/citrus aroma. From draft, it has a creamy feel that's good to the last drop. I'm glad to hear from casual beer drinkers that this is on thier list for thier favorite beers, so it has appeal for everyone.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,alexskovan,3.4,"Poured slightly hazy pale amber with a sturdy white head. Faint aroma of hops, very understated.

A decent APA if you like the grapefruit thing.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

I could easily put down a sixer.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,slider,4.25,"I believe this is the standard to judge all APAs against. It is a very good, but not spectacular, APA that is readily available.

140,276,BlackHaddock,2.63,"Brown 350ml bottle, best before mid Oct 2007, drank late March 2007.  Imported into the UK and sold in a lot of supermarkets, thought I'd see what all the fuss was about with Sierra Nevada beers.  Poured into my Corsendonk tulip glass it looked a bright traffic light amber, almost terracotta orange colour. A tight white head sat on top, bubbles replenishing the head from the base and side of the glass.  An aroma of sour hops, mashed with an iffy yeast culture, attacked my nose, obviously not a Brit Pale Ale, thats for sure.  Young, green taste, the beer isn't ready to drink yet. Made me burp straight away, which also indicates to me it isn't the finished article.  Dry and metalic aftertaste, sorry, not for me.  Not too sure what I was expecting from this beer, something smoother perhaps, certainly not the young, dry, tinny flavours which I found. I will try another in the summer maybe, to see if the warmer weather helps me see it's characteristics in a better light.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

T - Citrus taste dominate but in a smooth way, not acidic. Hoppiness evident in the aftertaste though very pleasant.  M - Felt really good with natural carbonation just at the right level.  D - One of these babies is not enough!  Yes this really is a classic pale ale and worthy of its reputation.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Redwood21,3.8,"this is a great beer, its very smooth, and goes down smooth. there is a definate taste of hops with a finish of hop/bitterness. However the bitter finish is by no means overpowering. There is a semi complex flavor profile, but still simple enough for someone new to pale ales. A great first pale ale, but one that you will come back to. Great pale ale and great beer. Must try.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,OStrungT,4.23,"This beer pours a clear light golden yellow color with a thin whate head. The head fades fast, leaving a nice sized lacing.  This beer has a very mild floral hop aroma. I can detect some biscuit like aroma also. A very subtle sweet caramel aroma is present. All the aroma of this beer is very mild and subtle, but it is still complex.  This beer tastes much like it smells. Some subtle floral and citrus hop flavor. Also some sweet malty caramel flavors mix in with a slight biscuit malt flavor. Very well balanced, and mild.  This beer goes down very smooth, leaving a very slight floral hop aftertaste. It is carbonated well. It is crisp and refreshing.  This beer would probably make a great session beer. It tastes good, but it is very mellow. It also is not too high in alcohol.  Overall: This beer is one that I often overlook. It is not anything special, but I think I should give it the attention it deserves in the future. It is a good beer for the style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Aroma is sweet citrus, with a little grapefruit, and something that comes across as bready. The taste is a little different than I would expect from the aroma - light, biscuity malt with hints of the citrus hops followed by a pleasant, but neutral flavored bittering. It has a clean finish and very good drinkability - I have sessioned this brew quite a few times. This is a great example of an APA and is always reliable and tasty.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Scent is biscuits and citrus.  Tangy and creamy sweet malty bread to start with salty citrus hops on the backend. Although understated, flavor is substantial, not light, with just a touch of hop bitterness and ends with a crisp dryness.  Mouthfeel is medium weight with a well carbonated bite at the front of the tongue.  Drinkability is very high.  Not hard to see why this one is a classic.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Monkeyknife,4.17,Poured from a bottle a very clear copper-gold with a creamy off-white head.  Aroma is malty and hoppy citrus.  The taste is balanced with the hops leading and followed by the malts. Very solid.  Mouthfeel is very smooth and lightly carbonated.  This is a very good pale ale.

140,276,auntfloyd,4.08,"Served from a 12 oz bottle into a US pint glass.  Pours a clear, bright, copper color, with about two fingers of perfectly white head, which lasts for quite a while.  The smell is fairly faint, but the American hops put forth a valiant effort. A slight maltiness is also present.  The flavor is good and well-balanced; although fairly hoppy for a pale ale, SNPA never goes beyond the realm of good taste. The hoppiness is countered by a subtle, but full-bodied caramel malt flavor, and whole is definitely greater than the sum of its parts. A very smooth-tasting and balanced ale  The mouthfeel is smooth, with good levels of carbonation. This is a fairly (for lack of a better word, and as regards mouthfeel only!) light beer, but never watery or underwhelming. Very good in this regards. As regards drinkability, is there a more drinkable beer? Not that I've seen anyway. This is the high-water mark of drinkability... smooth, yet flavorful; drinkable but not lacking in character. In 100 reviews, I've never given a 5 before, but I fully believe SNPA deserves it.  Overall, this is the beer that really introduced the Pale Ale to America, and there's no wonder why it is held in such high regards. SNPA is an ale everyone should experience; both as a great brew, and as a vanguard of the American micro-brew revolution.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,jmbranum,4.62,"This beer was my very first Pale Ale and definitely has been my point of comparison for the style ever since.  Beautiful glowing yellowish-orange brew with a fluffy white head. Clear with goregious bubbles making their way to the top.  The aroma . . . ahh... absolutely perfect. Floral herby hop aroma predominates with just a little bit of maltyness. The flavor is stunning and very well-balanced. Definitely you can taste the hop bitterness but it isn't too strong and doesn't clobber you in the head as do so many American Pale Ales.  Overall, this is my favorite American Pale Ale, mostly for its balance. I do enjoy IPA's from time to time too (especially Bridgeport and other Pacific NW beers) but for APA's, this beer is something else.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

The aroma is really weak on this beer...not sure why so many people bust a nut over it. Some foresty hops and nutty malt notes, but nothing special.  Taste has some hops, wheaty bread notes, and a bit of sour mash and metal. Not amazingly good by any means, but a cut above most grocery store beers. Feels a bit too dry, but leaves a good bubbly bite along with a decent, lingering aftertaste of hops. It drinks well enough, but doesn't have enough hops or depth for me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,adpietsc,4.57,This beer is simply one of the best in its class. It is a delicious American pale ale. It is highly drinkable and tastes very good. The hop taste really stands out in this beer.

Blobs of lacing and well over a two-finger creamy orange head. I bought one of the big bottles of 24 ounces.  Smell: hoppy as hell! Mostly floral hops with some earthy characteristics as well. Sweet malts and sutle fresh fruits.  Taste/Mouthfeel: big strong hop presence and slightly bitter. Cascade hop like flavors and smooth as a whistle going down. Sweet malt and fruit flavors hold everything together. Fruit flavors are more and more noticable. This has got to be one of my all time favorites! Just a nice balanced APA and super refreshing and crisp bitterness that is very enjoyable.  Always an enjoyable beer for me and I always reach for this one when I want an APA.

Carbonation is fairly high. Nose is very subdued but citric hops shine through. There's a bit of sour mustiness I can't put my finger on. Not offensive, just a little more low key than I was expecting.  Taste is like, what? That sip went down so fast and easy that I have to have another, then maybe another... It strikes a good balance between malt and hops, that's forsure. There's nothing outlandish here, just a very clean citric flavour and lots of earthy bittering hop character. The nutty malt is just enough to balance things out, there's a very mild caramel-like sweetness in the background, but nothing cloying to be sure. This is a very well-balanced and pleasing session beer. Mouthfeel is well carbonated, but not obnoxious, and the body is just perfect for the style. Aftertaste is bitter and finish is dry.

It has the pentultimate balance of malt and hops with an awesome bouquet of ... well, everything.

Solid fruity hops with a solid yet subdued malt presense. Light grain flavor presents itself occasionally. Bittering is present and easily acceptable for pretty much anyone. Bitterness lingers tamely with just a kiss of sweetness.  Mouth is medium-full with a gentle crispness.  Drinkability is off the chart. Mostly due to an incredible easily quaffable flavor and body.

140,276,witster18,4.07,this is truly a fantastic brew...we are lucky to see this across the country at selected grocers. The nose is grassy of hops and sweet of semi-sweet chocolate. The beer pours a amber color with lots of small bubbles...but the beer is carbonated perfectly....the taste starts with the grapefruit and then graduates to some beautiful malted goodness with some roastedness to it. This is where the sweetness and richness(chocolatyness) and some other palate cleaning bitterness of late hops balance things out. Exceptional...especially for its' availability...for quality/availability/price...this is HARD to beat. At 7.49 a six i'd say it blows away most nearly ALL the imports on the shelf.

Great piney/floral aroma that speaks of bitter grapefruit and biscuity malts to come.  Tastes similar to aroma. Great cripsness and pleasantly bitter w/ fresh piney hops with just enough malt backbone to make things interesting.

Very crisp, grassy, hops. For some reason I always think of celery with this beer too. Also, there is a little bit of mustiness to it. But, it all adds to the subtleness of this beer.  T- The crispness of the hops are the first thing that I notice. Pretty complex for a pale ale.  M- Good amount of carbonation adds to the little kick from the hops.  D- Highly drinkable.

The nose has the expected floral hop aroma for a pale, albeit mild. Hint of grain. The hop bitterness hits the palate immediately, balanced with a grainy/bready malt flavoring. Faint taste of alcohol combined with dry taste of hops leaves a crisp aftertaste. Texture of the ale comes off more thin than chewy.  A very easily drinkable pale ale.

Aroma--Good balance of bittering and floral hops in the nose. Overwhelms the malt character, but that's okay. Some notes of citris and pine.  Taste--Again, good mix of bittering and floral hops. Slightly bitter and dry. Get some nice woody overtones at the back of the toungue. Also some citrus, pine and some malt. More complex than most American pale ales.  Mouthfeel--Good. Medium body with a nice CO2 bite on the toungue. Clings to the inside of the mouth perfectly, giving you a nice after-taste. Carbonation level perfect.  Drinkability--Highly drinkable. Sessionable if you go solow. Good for daytime and night time drinking. Very versatile. A good beer for people looking to leave the American macros behind to cut their teeth on.  I really do need to try this stuff on tap one of these days.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,beeragent,3.89,"This is what a good pale ale should be! Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a light orange, with no head, and no lacing. The aroma is all hops with slight citrus. The taste is mostly hops, creating a very nice citrus flavor, with very little malt. The mouthfeel is medium. Overall, this is just a great pale ale. Very easy to drink, and a great session beer. Definitely try this one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,umustdrink,4.03,"A - Clear orange-yellow color. Pours a thick head, fades to an eighth inch. Average lace.  S - Bitter hops, slightly piny, with an earthy malt balance.  T - Clean balance of bitter hops with sweet brown sugary malts, hints of cinnamon and pepper. For a pale ale this is very hoppy.  M - Very smooth but with some carbonation to give it a little bite.  D - One of my favorite everyday beers, easy drinking, high sessionability.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,scoobybrew,3.6,"This was poured from the bottle into a pint glass. It has a light, clear, copper color with nice head and decent retention. The aroma is primarily a citrus like hop scent with malty notes in the background. The flavor is dominantly hops, but it has a tasty malt backing it up. The body is medium with moderately high carbonation.  Overall, this is a good APA. It defined the style way back when and is still an enjoyable beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,surcorx,4.3,"Appearance--pours a copper golden amber with a slight foam that doesn't last. Nothing too interesting.  Aroma--Medium pine hops and more hops. Citrus notes. Slight grassy notes. Complex.  Taste--Clean, bright and refreshing. Mildly bitter and dry. Pine, citrus and very mild malt. An expected slight bitter aftertaste. More complex than most. A great beer.  Mouthfeel--Perfect for the American style if not somewhat light in body. Mild carbonation and crisp.  Drinkability--Highly drinkable. The classic step up beer for nubies.  This is clearly one of America's finest beers. Everyone should be able to find it and should drink it. In this category I also enjoy Goose Islands Honkers Ale which is slightly more popular in the midwest.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,BlackAngus,2.32,"A - Light copper color, crystal clear. Nice fluffy head that lasted a while.  S - Citrus and floral aroma, but there's a subtler note of something unpleasant. I smells, I swear, like sweat. Not sure why. And not just this bottle. Every time I've had this beer, I've smelled this musky sweaty funk just below the hops. No malt aroma whatsoever.  T - Meh. Yeah, there are hops here, but nothing else. Maybe some very light sweetness.  M - Light body, extremely clean.  D - I can drink it, but there are many, many better beers out there. The best thing I can say about this beer is that it's the best thing Wal-Mart carries in the beer aisle.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,shadow1961,3.44,"Opening the pub pint of Sierra Neveda Pale Ale got me a rocky white head over a pretty light amber brew. Carbonation is moderate, and the nose is of malt with citrus notes. The flavor is mildly of malt and hops. Mouth- feel is light and crisp. As the brew warmed, definite floral, citrus, and bisquit flavors started coming out. Which just goes to show you a bigger bottle is the better way to really examine a brew. There's sort of a citrus/hop aftertaste. This isn't anything wildly special, but it's balanced and well crafted, and it would make for a good summer quencher or session brew. Alcohol by volume- 5.6%. Decent.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,friendofthedevil,4.2,"One of my favorite standby beers. A hoppy taste with a clean, clear finish, not to mention being everywhere in California, has made me sample this beer a great many times. Both in the bottle and on tap Sierra Nevada delivers with their Pale Ale. While not a ""special"" beer, nor one to be saved for that ""special occasion,"" it is a great brew to drink with friends in any situation. Receives a strong recommendation from me!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,bacabuck,3.45,"Average scores for appearance and smell may have to do with the fact that it was served on tap into a pilsner glass and the head did not properly form. Bad pour by the barkeep. Deep amber with minimal head. Good lacing along the sides of the glass. Very clear and bright. Smells of oatmeal and bananas. Taste has notes of coffee, earthy tones and finishs with a very slight bitterness. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy with low carbonation. Pour me another.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,zuggy9,4,"This is an excellent pale ale. It pours an nice copper-amber with good head retention. The smell is full of malts and a nice earthy hoppiness.

140,276,dmamiano,3.44,"Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is considered to be the benchmark American Pale Ale by many. While I consider it a fine product, many others in my opinion stack up a little better. The appearance of this pale ale is certainly acceptable, with an aroma that is quite pleasant. The beer in my opinion lacks malt character that I like in my pale ales and has a very ""thin"" mouthfeel. I have also found it to be inconsistant at times, although because of no dating on its label, it is hard to tell where the fault in that is...the retailer or the brewer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,paulisme,4.55,"I've chosen Sierra Nevada Pale Ale for my first review because it's my favorite all-around beer. This one never fails to satisfy; I just love the strong and distinct taste of this beer. It pours a nice copper color with a thin head which doesn't hang around long. Both aroma and taste have hints of citrus. Finishes with a nice, slightly bitter aftertaste. This is the pale ale by which I judge all others; I've yet to find a better one among the dozen or so I've tasted. If you live in the Southeast US, try this beer with the chicken fingers and Zax sauce from Zaxby's. It's one of my favorite food/beer combinations.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,goschool,4,"There's almost 1000 reviews already. I probably don't need to run through all the particulars.  It pours an amber hue with a decent-sized off-white head the lasts quite a long time. The aroma has pine and malts. This is crisp and clean, but it's got more flavor than it get credit for having and the hop bitterness, which takes on a citrus character in the taste, is huge compared to the beers at most of the bar that serve it. It's medium-bodied and lively. A true benchmark.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Poser,4.4,"Pours a medium copper. Decent head w/ good lacing. Slightly heavy malts but it has a good hoppy aftertaste with some strong citrus flavors throughout. Just when you think it's a little too sweet, it finishes with an oatmeal flavor.  Overall, a great APA and one you can find anywhere, even in Prohibition south. A great beer for just having a beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,olegv40,3.76,"Poured a deep golden, with an admirable head. Hoppy aroma with hints of citrus, but too faint to stand out in any real way. The initial taste had major overtones of orange, quickly replaced by bitterness. The hops here seem less about flavor and more about bitterness, yet it never really felt like it got in the way, and the bitter flavor subsided to a much more sweet taste that finished very clean. The end result is a very good beer that is very enjoyable, and being readily available at many places that otherwise only serve macrobrews, it becomes a great choice during a night out at the bar.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Celt44,4.35,Apprearance is a beautiful copper/amber combo. Aroma is heavy on the malt up front but piney hops pierce their way through towards the end. Taste is superior for a pale ale - not too dry and not too bitter. Mouthfeel is perfectly balanced. Overall a Superior Pale Ale - Slightly above average ABV make this one a great tasty session brew...,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,terrabyte,4.07,"Pours a clear, yellow-orange color with a medium white foam that disappeared on me. Lacing throughout.  Aroma had a light piney hops smell, bordering on airy or grassy.  Flavor wasnt as hoppy as the aroma led me to believe. However, it was still apparent and still enjoyable. In fact, this allowed some floral, grassy, and citrus malts to come forward and weave into the palette.  Mouthful was light, crisp, but just a tad foamy.  Drinkability is quite high. With the lightness on each flavor and a light body, everything was able to balance well with each other. This is doing MORE with LESS, and its no wonder its a winner throughout the nation. Its great for those who want to bridge the gap from tasteless BMC, and its great for someone like me who likes bold flavors but only when theyre his favorite flavors. Pine & Grapefruit hops are not my favorite, and this beer toned it down to a level that was very enjoyable for me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,JohnnyM2002,4.07,"Sampled from the tap, poured into a Sierra Nevada pint glass on pint night.  A - Pours a clear, golden color with red highlights and good carbonation.  S - Powerful combination of pine & grassy hops. Nice citrus blend in the background.  T - Not as overly-hoppy as the aroma suggests. The piney/grassy flavors blend very well with the milder hops. I've heard people talk about the hoppiness of this beer, but it's definitely not too packed with hoppy goodness....instead, it's a very good blend of citrus malt and grassy hops. Sorry to ramble...  M - Medium body with very good carbonation.  D - Definitely one of the top APA's I've ever had and a great brew to keep on hand for an everyday selection.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,ClockworkOrange,4.6,"Light amber with an inch of off white foam. Great head retention. Smells of sweet malt, pine and citrus. Tastes of grapefruit and piney hops. Just the right amount of malt to back it up. Very crisp and dry in the mouth. really refreshing. This beer will always have a place in my fridge.  Well I've been drinking this beer since the early 90's and it tastes the same today as it did back then. You can never go wrong with this American classic. SNPA has never let me down. it's been a staple in my fridge for more than 15 years. If it were not for this beer and this brewery blazing a path, we would most likely be stuck with a lot less choice when it comes to craft beer. Drink it now and drink it often.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,maddogruss,3.16,"Had this tonight at the business get together. Wasn't sure if it was an English pale ale or an APA when I was there, so I figured it was an English pale ale because it tasted very malty. It had a good look to it: dark amber color with a decent, white head that retained throughout the beer. Smelled very malty; did not notice any kind of hops at all. Tasted malty as well; once again, no hoppy traces even noticed in the aftertaste which led be to believe that it was an English pale ale. A pretty nice mouthfeel; pretty thick, similiar to a Sam Adams in regards to mouthfeel. A good, drinkable beer, but did not taste like a good APA; I would have expected at least a little bit of a hoppy taste, at least to balance the malt, if I knew it was an APA when I was drinking it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,BeerBelcher,3.83,"I've had this beer many times, but never reviewed it. I feel like the introduction of this beer represents a contribution to the American craft brewing scene, and thus needs to be considered in the context of its time and place and not next to Three Floyds Alpha King, Big A IPA, Maharaja, and other beers that likely wouldn't exist without Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.  Appearance is fairly classic APA - orangey, bright, and sparkling. Only one finger of foam which was retained fairly well and left some lacing.  Odor is very lightly estery hop aroma.  Taste is light (relative to some of the other APAs I mentioned above) hippiness, and pleasingly light bitterness.  In my mouth, it is just slightly sticky, which I've come to associate with APAs.  This beer is highly drinkable; I could drink these all night.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,bigpatvoodoodad,4.6,"Pale Ale is probably my favorite style, second only to English Brown Ale, and this beer in particular is my favorite of Pale Ales. As silly as it may sound, I like the serene green color of the label and artwork. Now, as far as the beer itself, well it is just spectacular. It is very refreshing and not overly heavy. I simply love the spicy taste and the pleasantly bitter aftertaste always leaves me wanting another after I've finished a bottle or pint. Needless to say, this is a very drinkable beer by my standards and what I consider the bench mark when comparing other American pale ales.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Damian,2.96,"Drank on-tap at Sully's Pub, Hartford, CT  Poured a clear, reddish amber with a one-finger pillowy head. Some bits of spotty lacing.  Smell was hardly detectable initially. As the beer warmed, the aroma became somewhat more pronounced. Musty with a touch of citrusy hops in the background.  The taste was somewhat similar to the smell. Not much happening on the front end except maybe a touch of malty sweetness. As the beer moved to the rear of the palate, it became increasingly bitter but lacked the citrusy hop flavor that should have accompanied this. Somewhat grainy and resin-like on the back of the palate. Aftertaste was hoppy and bitter (orange peel was noticeable) and lingered on forever. (This was unquestionably the most impressive part of the beer.)  Mouthfeel was fairly creamy, smooth and full-bodied.  Overall, this beer was a disappointment, as it lacked the flavors and aromas needed to make up for its intense bitterness.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,PEBKAC,4.05,"The classic summer pour is back for one more round. Buried deep, one last summer bottle remains.  Mellow gold. A Really heavy & thick mushroom cap envelops the edges of the pint glass. Almost like paste, no bubbles, except where the whitewash makes contact with the outside rim. Not really content with sticking around, it stands for about a minute, then collapses like a tower of Jenga, leaving craters & valleys where civilizations of yeasts once toiled the land & raised their families. Ok, it's just a beer.  Spicy & refreshing, like a full-strength hose sprayed right into your face on a hot summer day. You haven't actually been able to drink any, but you know if try hard enough, you eventually will.  Consistant like a glass of sparkling wine. There's always a little extra carbonation riding the stairway to heaven. Bitterly sweet grapefruit rind, with a saltine cracker finish that makes everything so pleasant. Nothing too crazy or complex.

The taste is very well-balanced -- the same malty sweetness balanced out by a pungent but not overpowering sour-citrusy hop bite. Nice, crisp mouthfeel with good carbonation. Extremely drinkable.  I really can't find any flaws -- the perfect session beer and the perfect beer to keep around to go with absolutely anything. I love this beer.

140,276,nathanho,4,"I used to think SNPA was one of the greatest beers ever. While still a solid brewery, Sierra Nevada, is no longer a ""go to"" for me. Yes, I still look forward to and enjoy Celebration, and if I were stranded on a desert isle with nothing but Torpedo to drink, I'd be pretty happy. Tropical Torpedo is solid, but doesn't come close to Ballast Point's Sculpin offerings. I'm not bashing, I'm just far past it. That being said, if I were adrift at sea in a lifeboat with 10 other people, having 10 cases of Fat Tire, or Blue Moon, or some Sam Adams swill...and another lifeboat with 10 occupants had 10 cases of SNPA, I would grab the conch, find the first husky guy in the other boat, and bash his skull in with a rock, or a belaying pin, or an oar, or a turnbuckle, or a rock...just to get my hands on that SNPA. I would be fairly casual about it, compared to the onslaught that would occur for any of a number of superior offerings. Field to Ferment comes to mind...

The taste is of mild citrus - lemon and orange - with a sweet malt balance. The hop bitterness has an edge over the sweetness, but is fairly well-controlled, as per the style.

There wasn't much head, but I think that was more a factor of the pour since the lace was more than apparent. Since there was no head, there was no retention either.

The last time I had this was before I started making an effort to analyze what I was enjoying. I've loved craft beers since I found them, but only recently (since the discovery of this website) have I started writing about em'.  I hate to say it, but the twist top kills it for me, and resulted in a deduction in the appearance category. I know it's petty, but I have a block when it comes to equating great beer & twist tops. Besides that, it's appearance is unremarkably attractive.  This is the template for the ""West Coast Pale Ale"", and it smells like it. The scent is very outdoorsy, piney, and fresh. It's not a huge attention grabber, but it makes you want a taste. A wonderfully refreshing, unpretentious taste of an American classic.  The mouthfeel is addictive, partially due to the sticky hop finish which leaves you thirsty for another gulp.

The nose was dominated by hops with a hint of citrus thrown in. There was a natural and fresh smell to this beer, very pleasant indeed.  The hops dominated through to the taste with a good deal of maltiness added in for some good measure. This felt very light on the palate, but given it is a pale ale it does what it is supposed too. Again the sense of freshness was brought through to the taste. This is a very refreshing beer that would have been better tried in the middle of summer rather than november in Scotland.  I found this to be very easy to drink, next time I organise a BBQ I will purchase a number of these.

Smell is of grain along with some citrusy hops, along with some sweetness.  Taste is citrusy. Grapefruit is definitely present along with a little spice and some pale malt as well.

140,276,TurdFurgison,3.73,"I've had this so many times, it's bizarre I've never rated it yet. Tonight I had it on tap with dinner in Mountain View, CA.

140,276,Neehan,4,"Pours a clear copper with a generous head. A complex smell of grassy grains, hops, and bitter elements. A smooth yet biting taste of hops and grains.

140,276,BlackJeremiah,4.01,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  A: Coppery, golden, clear as crystal. Lots of streaming, but almost lazy in tempo. Head is white, foamy, with good lacing.  S: Biscuity malt, bready yeast--sweet scents. Hop smells are more citrusy than piney, but retain elements of both.  T: Nice, crisp hop and light carbonation melt into mild, sweet malt flavors. A complex, well-balanced, benchmark pale ale. Lemon, orange, pine tar, raisin nut bread and biscuits.  M: A bit drying, crisp, light on the tongue. Refreshing and pitch-perfect for the style.  D: An ideal--maybe THE ideal--session beer. Drinks well, with an ABV that is present, but not prohibitive to drinking a sixer during the ball game.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

There was a thin white film of head that lasted for a bit.  S- The smell of nice pine hops had a hint of ginger and pineapple weed in the background that gave some nice depth to the smell.  T- This beer has a light pale malt flavor that was good with a light hop spice note in the finish. The hops had a dry coriander hint that was almost like ginger. There was a hop bitterness that came through in the aftertaste.  M- This beer has a light body with a tight little fizz finish that boost the hops bitterness a bit.

140,276,uberabr,4.09,"Light, golden amber. Great carbonation. Decent head with very fine white bubbles.  Unique aroma, one that leaves me looking for words outside the typical food domain. Not much complexity at all, but the hopps are such a pleasure. I don't even have a word in my repetoir to describe it. It smells like the wilderness, a mountainy backwoods spring-water purity. Truly refreshing as an outdoorsman trapped in the city. A sweet, beachy honeydew.  Mouthfeel is good; well carbonated and moderate to full, zesty body. Tastes a kind of grassy, hoppy, sour malt. The maltyness shows up more in the aftertaste. The bitterness is definitely there, and makes a unique combination with the sour quality, a wholegrain sweet, but not sugary, effect...plays quite the trick on your tongue!  It's definitely a bit unrefined, and the extreme hoppyness is a little overbearing, but in a truly American style.  I admire Sierra Nevada and particularly love this beer. This beer is everywhere in California, I'm talking gas stations and grocery stores, so perhaps it seems a little too good to be true. I have very fond memories of sipping this brew up in lake tahoe in ski lofts during snow storms, and at outdoor concerts during the summer. Definitely a session ale.  Bottom line: This APA is a trendsetter, a one-of a kind craft-brew taste from a commercial brewery.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,isaac,4.07,"poured into my rogue dead guy pint glass.  A - this is a nice looking beer - a coppery amber hue with minimal head, which left nice lacing down the glass. i would have liked to see more foaminess on top, but, i guess, that's just my aesthetic.  S - a very light smell - sweet, fruity hop juice with tones of citrus and pear.  T - again, somewhat light - very crisp with a start of grapefruity hops, a brief middle period of sweet malt, and a sort of lemon rind finish. not overly bitter, not overly sweet.  M - medium bodied - it starts off quite bubbly and stings the tounge, but afterwards is all smooth and coating.  D - high - i really enjoyed this beer, it is refreshing, simple, but not overly simple. definitely feels like something i would drink with a dog at the ballgame, but, you know, in the good seats. also, everything about this beer, from the twist cap, to the wide bottle, to the relatively low ABV, screams session ale. though not my first choice of beer, i'll always go back to this one if i have to shop at the good ol' 7-11. otherwise, i'll take a 22 oz. of something a little more interesting.  all and all, a well rounded beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,cjgator3,3.97,"Pours a murky coppery amber color with a white lace that clings well onto the glass. Aroma is dominated by citrusy hops that give way to a slight maltiness and a bit of a metallic smell in the nose as well. Smooth bodied and a pretty simple straight forward beer (which is not a bad thing). Not overly hopped but a good amount. Overall, this is a good classic beer that is slightly better on-tap.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,bgraney,4.2,"Pours a light amber with a full fluffy head. Nice lemony background in the aroma, nothing overpowering. Smooth and subtle taste of nicely balanced hops and malt.

140,276,elricorico,4.05,"A friend brought me a bottle from Vegas this week. This is one of the beers I've wanted to try for a while.  Pours a slightly hazy orange with a finger of creamy off-white head. The head recedes, but remains as a half centimetre cap. Looks good to me.  A good toffee like malt base in the smell with a hearty dose of flowery and citrus smelling hops. Overall impression is a very fresh aroma that gets my mouth watering.  Malt doesn't keep up in the taste as much as it did in the smell. This is a beer for the hop lovers. From front to back it starts to bite on the tongue with a bitter and grainy run of hops. Some citrus tartness in the very end. As it warms more malt character starts to show, bringing a bit of that toffee sweetness to balance things out.  Mouthfeel is pretty good, with lively carbonation and a bit of body to it. My one complaint is the front of my tongue almost feels stripped. Whether it is from the hops or the carbonation I can't tell.  This is a very quaffable version of a very quaffable style. I know the Americans can get it practically everywhere, hopefully it is just a matter of time for it to come to Canada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Ben Frankins B day. The Beer that kick-started the IPA revolution. The Cascade hop wonder......  AP: A very active pale/Golden and amber color. 2"" thick frothy white head. Head has good retention. Decent lace.*update....the lace is long, sticky with a constant ring.  Smell: An Herbal, yeastie malt with slight wheat and oasts scent, very hearty and herbalized hop detected. *update* Herbal spice for sure, almost amber malty aroma. Honey and mild citrus hop. Tangy and pine scent.  Taste: A hearty, herbal and earthy hop flavor dominates, yeastie malt balances it very well. There's some wheat and earthy notes. The after-taste is dominated by a leafy hop flavor. Very clean tasting. *update section: The cascade hop is very earthy, only slightly bitter /dry and tangy. Only mild citrus/pine taste detected. I often forget just how malt-balanced this Pale Ale is ! Good balance and a long, bitter, dry and earthy aftertaste prevails.*  MF: A dry and refreshing crisp feel, good bite. *update: Big crisp and sharp bite, mellows to a rather hefty, medium-malt body. Dry in the finish.  DA: this one is an all-time classic for myself and many others...I've brought this one to many music festival over the years and it has kept everyone very happy for the weekend. now, that's drinkability! * update: I remember this one being very hoppy-bitter back in the day.

My palate has become almost immune to hops, but the bitterness started coming out towards the end of the pint and became pretty enjoyable. Semi-sweet beer with all the fruity hops and the strong malt backing. 3.5 for drinkablity because it's too filling. A pint and a slice was hard to tackle down, even though I was pretty hungry. I always feel like I just ate 4 bowls of oatmeal after a glass of most SN beers. Hard to believe , this day and age, that this relatively tame beer was once bold and extreme, and started the craft beer revolution. Times they are a-changing!  An average beer that doesn't exactly excite me, but it's solid and consistant with an enjoyable gentle boldness.

Hops are really citrus, like lemon and lime. These are the typical american hop smells.  Taste is hoppy with distinct citrus notes and exotic fruits, a little sharp.

It's become trendy to downgrade SN recently and extol the supposed superiority of some small upstart--- most of which are not near as good (and many of which are either over-hopped or over-alcoholed attention seekers) Of the good ones, many are are good precisely because they so closely mimic SN.  Success does breed contempt and. also, once it became commonplace it lost the ""cool factor"" so important to folks, but this remains one of the very best beers in America. some of SN's other varieties may not be that great but this is.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

A: even with such a large margin left for the beer head to build up (350ml beer in a imperial-pint glass), the beer head comes surprisingly restrained, on top of a clear amber body with very mild carbonation. Quite unlike any American bottled beers I've tried. S: intensely honey-ish and sweet bouquet hops, on top of a juicy peach+lychee-ish fruits and caramely malts. Very well-blended and rather settled. Pleasant but not exciting. T: effervescent-textured maltiness comes hand in hand with bitter-sweet yet aromatic, elderflowery, peachy, and sweet orangey hoppyness on top of a mildly sweet yet intense caramely malty base, a bitter-sweet tinge of lychee-fruits (on skins), tannic edge of grape-stems, and a quietly green-tea like aromatic aroma... moderately bitter and soothing in the finish.

140,276,zebedee,3.79,"Now, Ive always been ignorant of American ales, until I discovered this site, mainly because the only American beers Ive ever seen here are the usual Bud/Miller shite. Suffice to say, this ale was part of a new line in my local, evil supermarket, so I thought, what the heck, Ill try it.  This ale poured a marmalade orange colour, with a one finger head of weak, brilliant white foam. There was little noticeable carbonation. The head quickly dissipated until there was but a thin film covering the beverage.  The smell, I found intriguing. Parma violets initially came to the fore, with some sherbet and a hint of liquorice. This gave way to oranges and lychees. Quite an aroma I thought.  Despite the smell, which I feared would be a precursor to a sickly sweet drink, I actually found it fairly delicate. It tasted like I was drinking a liquid bouquet, with violets and lavender, with some sour apple thrown in for good measure. The finish was quite dry, and slightly sour.  I felt little carbonation on the tongue, but it does hit the back of the throat on the way down. I feel this adds to the dryness, which isnt a bad thing at all. It felt thin in the mouth, but not in a negative fashion.  This ale is light and crisp, and I would certainly be able to sink a few in a sitting. It lacks the sickly sweet taste I feared it would have, and is overall a nicely rounded drink. This would go down just chipper on a warm, dry day, which we seldom have here:(.

T - The scent is not deceiving. The taste starts with a nice grapefruit hop bite (not too strong) that flows over the tongue and is followed by the same lightly sweet breadymalts apparent in the smell.

I think many of their products are excellent, and the snpa is the flagship. This used to be my favorite session beer. Why do I say used to be? Two reasons: first, I think this beer is not quite the beer it used to be. This is true both because it has stood still while great hoppy beers grew around it, but also because I think it has lost a little of its unique flavoe over the years. Second, I think this beer has had freshness and consistency problems as it has grown larger. I've had way to many snpas that were stale tasting if not downright skunky. This is particularly true on tap, but I've had some bad bottles too. I think its the beer, not the storage, but as snpas presence has become more ubiquitous, I'm sure there are more places that don't treat it right. Also, I think the tap beer is not as good as the bottles (Except maybe at the brewery- where its wonderful). The krausening in the bottles lends the brew a fruity yeastiness that is part of its charm. This is really lacking on tap, where an earthier taste comes through. When you find it really fresh and well handled, this can still be a near perfect brew, but its getting harder to find that way imo.  The beer came from the tap a beautiful copper color with a good head and excellent lacing throughout.  The smell is pretty good- earthy hops, but maybe with a little bit of a stale aroma as well. The draft lacks some of the fruity esters of the bottled.  The taste is still solid, fairly soft up front with a good earthy piney hop bitterness. A little stale on the finish.  The mouthfeel is fairly thin, but there is some creaminess there as well. The hops are pretty clean, but not a hop explosion. The thinner body helps the beer remain balanced.  Very drinkable, but best when really fresh. My scores are for draft at an average place. They would be higher at the brewery or in bottles.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,xzqrut,3.53,"Beer poured from the tap, a nice copper color, with excellend head, retention, and lacing. Gave a mild hop aroma and taste, but felt it lacked a little in the bitterness category compared to other pales. Gave a nice crisp mouthfeel, good drinkability. All in all an very good beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,ghostmech007,4.03,"A copper color with a lace that hugs the bottle like there is no freakin tommorow.  The smell is all hops which blends into a malt sorta of blend and a bit of fruit smell as well.  Smooth body but full of flavor which helps.. Simple straight forward beer, which is good in my opinion. A good hop.  All in all, I have this in my fridge at all times. No matter how much my friends make fun of me. This is a good beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,dblinkhorn,4.1,"Poured from a 12 oz into a glass tulip goblet.  Appearance - A nice thick head accompanies the pour. It is bubbly and barely tan. The beer is medium darkness amber-orange coloration, which is perfectly crystal clear. There is no haze whatsoever. Lots of lace all the way down the glass...reminds me of a Belgian ale.  Smell - One of the main reason I love this brew. You stick your nose down in the glass and you smell one of the finest, most crisp hop aroma of nearly any beer. The hop smell is clean, citrusy and full of character. Also present is a very mellow malty presence.  Taste - The flavor is very clean and crisp. Hops up front, which taste of lemon, medium bitterness, very slightly sour. The malt occupies a higher percentage of the taste than the smell. It is very smooth and mellow, but has a strong, defined flavor. Very good.  Mouthfeel - This brew has perfect carbonation. The beer is medium- to light-bodied and very smooth in the mouth.  Drinkability - Perfect. One can easily enjoy four of five of these without a problem.  Overall, this is a great brew. It's main strengths are it's crisp and clean character, along with its excellent hop flavor and aroma. This brew is high-quality...a must have.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,horndecker,4.3,"First words that come to mind are: well built, sturdy, balanced, and delicious. A fine, soft white head sits for a short time above a clear butterscotch amber. The smells are fresh, citric and piney hops and bakery. The taste has a wonderful smooth bitter start, a sweet malt follows, chewy and slightly nutty. Great balance. The finish is dry and long. The mouthfeel is buttery and full. Everything works. It's a hit. So, so drinkable and doesn't fade.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Dizzy,4.17,"Sierra Nevada is the standard upon which all APA's should be measured. It pours hazy amber with off white head. The smell is citrusy (grapefruit) hops. Taste is malty sweetness, fruitiness, citrusy hop flavor and hop bitterness, all in a perfect balance. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a lot of carbonation. I could have several of these easily. I would certainly reccomend this.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,robocrouch,4,"Poured a rich copper/amber color. With maybe a hint of red. Perfect off white head, laced very well to the glass. About a finger or two thick. I loved the bits of yeast that floated to the bottom.  Taste was very impressive. Up front had robust flavor that continued with hints of grapefruit that finished with a very nice bite. Wow what a beer this is.  Drink ability is great. This is a perfect beer to enjoy while fishing.  Overall a very solid brew. The perfect model for what an APA should be. I will have to make a permanent spot in my fridge for this as it starts to become available nation wide.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,jokelahoma,4.08,"This oine poured a nice burnished copper color, clear as can be. The head was about average, off white, and faded quickly to a thin layer of foam.  The nose is quite citrusy. There's not much malt to be found in the aroma. It's hoppy, but not scary hoppy. Really not overpowering in any way. Just a good, clean, balanced smell.  The taste reflects that balance as well. There's a good bitterness up front, followed by fruity, flowery, citrusy hop flavors. The malt is more present in the aftertaste, as an earthiness that linger, riding shotgun with the floral aftertaste of the hops. There are no real flaws to be found here. Just a good, well made, well balanced beer.  The body is just thick enough to be substantive. Almost perfect for the style.  This is arguably the mother of American pale ales, a status it wears well and deserves to keep. When one compares pales, the standard to which they're compared is Sierra Nevada. Everyone should try this at least once.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,BoozySmurf,4,"clear, golden amber with a frothy white head  malty, doughy, and citrusy aromas  sweet, caramel & biscuit malts, flowery & citrusy hop bitterness provide balance  light-medium bodied, crisp with a bitter finish  drinkability is good as expected for this classic american pale ale",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,pmcadamis,4.17,"This pale ale pours golden amber with a quickly rising foamy head. After an initial agressive pour, the head nearly reached the bottom of the pint glass, but rose quickly to a one-finger head that stayed the duration. Left nice laces of foam on the glass.  *sniff* *sniff* Smells great! I smell hops first, citrus fruit second. Upon subsequent sniffs I smell grapes somewhere in there. Definitely zesty and astringent in a pleasant way. Tickles the nose hairs! (maybe it' s time to trim those suckers).  *sip* *sip*.... Wow! I taste grape fruit and a lemon-rind zing along with hops. This could be a great thirst-quencher in the summer! Slightly sweet at first, citrusy aftertaste. Bitter, but only slightly and in a very good way!  Mouthfeel is zesty and refreshing. I really like this!  Overall, a very good pale ale that would be great in the summer. Complex enough to be enjoyable, but light enough to drink several....this beer could be quite dangerous. Awesome.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,mherring,4.12,"This is one of those beers that you really have to fight yourself on as far as when to stop. I could easily kill a sixer of this without much thought. Pours a nice light brownish/red color with just a small bit of foam. The smell is very nice indeed, one of the best smelling beers I've ever had I think. It's got a very nice blend of hops and citrus, with the hops maybe taking a slight edge. Taste is also good, a bit citrusy at first and then very hoppy with a pretty smooth feel to it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Hollenbeck2,4.18,"to me this is a classic  probably one of the first micro breweries I had and the first that I actually visited in Chico, CA.  I have had this in the bottle and on tap and both are great and very drinkable to me. It has a amber color and an exceptionally full-bodied character. Cascade hops give this Pale Ale its fragrant floral and spicy flavor.  The beer has a bright, perky high note of maltiness and orange tastes and has a hint of hoppiness, the hoppiness is not over the top by any means.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,xav33,3.36,"Sierra Nevada Pale Ale 12 oz bottle Recent bottling, savored 07/06 Medium pour in a shaker.  Poured with hues of amber and copper, with consistant off-white head.  Smelt of fruity citrus and a hint of biscuity malt.  Taste begins with soft citrusy piney hops a subtle sweet bready malt kick, with enduring sour pineness. A soft approach and gentle release on the palate. Mouthfeel was slightly creamy and average carbonation.  Overall, a classic American pale ale that sets a standard, but gives room for improvement.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,beerphilosopher,3.42,"Presents itself as a nice light amber with a thick white head. Sporadic lacing in the pint glass. Nose is lively with hops, citrus, floral notes, and candy. Palate is definitely hoppy up front, with a good malty backbone giving it a touch of sweetness. Good flavor. Mouthfeel is light, with a good hop bite. Adequate carbonation. A very refreshing pale ale with strong hop presence. Something short of an IPA, of course, but isn't shy with the hops. Finishes quite well balanced. This is another one I can get on-tap locally and am thankful for it. A nice alternative to the macro crap that rules this region. A good solid American Pale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,MusicmanSD,3.78,"Ah, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, the ravest of beer these days besides Corona and all that Mexican stuff. Pours a copper-ish red color with robust head. The smell is very strong, noble hops again? I swear Redhook ESB and this beer have the exact same bitterness characteristics...Taste is strong and bitter, what a beer with balls should taste like. Not anything like the European Pale Ales! I'll say that much! The drinkability is low because of its bitterness, but it is damn tasty with many different elements slapping your tongue from all angles. Maybe I'm not old enough to fully appreciate the taste of this beer yet, but its something I'd definitely get to have fun with some friends with. And the ABV will promise that!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,teg8612,3.7,A-Pours a nice copper color with a thick head. Slight residue gets left on the glass.  S-The smell is good with the hops dominating with a hint of floral notes.  T-Taste is smooth with the hops standing up and begging for attention. Not really terrible that a none-hophead can't enjoy it's wonders. Not real malty or it might just be overpowered by the hops however there is a nice hint of citrus and flower to even out the brew. More bread-like malt flavor as it warms.  M-Mouthfeel is medium with an upundance of carbonation. Crisp and dry.  D-This is a great beer to sit around with and have a few. Alcohol content is higher than normal but not overly so which means the evening won't have to end too soon. One of the better APA's out there that really has become the standard for other breweries to follow. A great step to work your way up the hop-ladder to the big IPA's out there.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,escapements,3.02,"A=Nice color. Looks like beer, nothing special.  T=Hoppy as a pale ale should be (however, not my favorite), citrus & pine. Slight bitterness with a clean finish. Only slightly malt, could use more. Slight alcohol taste.  S=Citrus & hops  M=Smooth & dry which makes you want another sip  D=Not a bad overall beer, but lacks any outstanding qualities.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,thelagerheads,2.6,"Fishbine, we meet again. I've said this before with the Bell's Two Hearted Ale and I reiterate it here: I simply don't get the appeal of pale ales with their citrusy rind taste. It's an intentional thing but comes through like a tragic mistake. Why muddle an otherwise smooth and creamy beer with a brunt anvil of flavor? It warms a lot better than the Two Hearted Ale but the sugar-sucked lemon-orange squeeze of bitterness gives me no joy.

140,276,DaveFL1976,4.3,"What a classic American brew. SNPA pours a golden honey colour with a fluffy white head that sticks to the side of the glass. The nose is sweet but citrusy and spicy with hops. The taste is bigger than most any widely available brew. Plenty of bittering hops, plenty of aroma hops, and plenty of malt to balance it all out.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,flexabull,4.4,"A standard. When you say ""Pale Ale"" in the USA, this is usually what you mean. I think you can't really go wrong with this one... this is always a good choice at a bar or a pub. It isn't my favorite all time brew, but certainly a stand by. I have also found that this is one of the few beers I have tried that doesn't seem to lose much when drank from a bottle. An excellent session beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,HoustonTX,4.07,"A - Copper color, pale white frothy head, good retention, and only small streams of lacing line the glass.  S - Hops and malted barley.  T - Initial taste is quick and strikes the palate at a fast pace. A malt backbone which is balanced by biting hops. Residual sweetness thrown into the mix. Along with floral, citrus peel, and earthy undertones from the hops. Finish is suprisingly dry and bready.  M - Crisp and a tad oily on the palate.  D - Excellent drinkability.  A classic example of the APA style. A must try.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,MiScusi,4.33,"3/14/07 (On tap at the Flying Pig Pub- the bar that is attached to Lucille's BBQ in Victoria Gardens, Rancho Cucamonga, CA) After drinking a lot of Sierra Nevada lately (mostly when there isn't something more interesting on tap) I've come to realize this actually is a very good beer. The appearance is actually about as good as I think a pale ale could be (along with BJ's Piranha Pale Ale). The smell is fairly standard, and the taste has a very nice citrus burst at the beginning, followed quickly by pine which causes a short lasting bitterness after the sip. It is so light for a pale ale yet has such great flavor that the drinkability is outstanding. 4.5/4.0/4.5/4.0/4.5 ___ 7/22/06 I use to think this was the best beer I could ever have. After having other pale ale's I've found out that there are better out there, but this one certainly isn't bad. I feel like this lacks just a bit in the malt backbone it needs. It's got the hops there in good quantity but the extra little bit of complexity is missing. It's still good, and I actually see a lot of people drinking this out of the bottle which I just don't understand how they enjoy it that way. 4.0/4.0/4.0/4.0/4.0",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,boatyard,4.2,"so yeah i eally enjoy seeing the little ""floaters"" hanging out in the bottom of this fine bottle conditioned ale. now i am not all that great about identifying the flavors i taste, so i will be simple here. it has this nice color about it when poured. looks like a penny to me. not a shiny penny but one thats been in your pocket a few times. and it has a nice white head that leaves a decent lacing. smells piney, citrusy and sweet, and it tastes just like it smells. not alot of carbonation that i can see, or taste, but what a fine beer. this beer is the one i would reccomend all people try who want to better there beer taste. simply put not too complex, but not simple at the same time. i love SNPA",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Hops dominate smell, but some malt sweetness is there as well. Taste is exactly what I love in a pale ale: plenty of hops and yet a good malt body. Mouthfeel is lighter than the eastcoast (dogfish) stuff that I'm used to, but I still love this beer. Drinkability is great due to the lighter mouthfeel. This beer is the trademark entry into craft brewed beer. Sierra Nevada has yet to upset me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,mithrascruor,4.33,"12 oz. bottle poured into a mug.  Appearance: Pours a semi-hazy golden orange color. White frothy head is light and airy. Quite a bit of carbonation in the beer.  Smell: Nice aroma of hops with some light, fresh plant smells (flowers, leaves, etc.). Some grains are also noticable.  Taste: Great taste of hops, citrus, and malts, with floral elements as well. The hop bitterness is nicely balanced with the somewhat sweet florals. Aftertaste is mostly bitter citrus.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and smooth with a slightly grainy texture.  Drinkability: Fairly strong ABV for a pale ale, but completely drinkable. Goes down well time after time, and it remains enjoyable.  When I first had this beer (well over a year ago), I didn't like it. I found it much too citrusy. Either that bottle was from a bad batch, or I've grown to appreciate this a lot more; I'm not sure... This is definitely a top-notch American pale ale that is widely available. Everyone should try this beer -- it looks and tastes great, and you really can't go wrong with it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

D: Not enough hops to completely destroy my palate. Balanced; I want more after every sip.  I really like this beer.

140,276,TheSarge,4.25,"Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale has to be accredited with helping to boost the craft beer scene into the general public eye. I reviewed this brew at the Cheesecake Factory, which just shows this beer has a fine appreciation.  Initially this brew pours with a wet frothy head, which condenses into a sticky texture froth. After several minutes the lace is behind and sticks to the end. The body is golden amber, and has evidence of a moderate amount of CO2.  SN's Pale Ale is very fragrant. There's ample hop aroma, giving off citrusy and floral essences.  To me, the taste is somewhat toffee like. When I put it in a different perspective, it can kind of taste a bit like strawberries. This is a very finely balanced brew.  This feels a bit coarse and wet at the same time. Definitely a quencher.  TheSarge",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,hylton44,4.77,"O-blessed king of the American pale ales!  You entice my tongue with your sharp, squeaky, citrusy scent. You sooth me with the promise of your rich, dark yellow hue. You brighten my day with a sparkling white, even head.  I love Sierra Nevada Pale Ale! I know countless beverages from pop to beer have promised ""clear sparkling"" water within their lists of ingredients, but in the S.N.P.A., I really find myself wondering if they have some secret fount that makes this brew as damned refreshing as it is. There's just something clean tasting about it. It carries also a sharp, bitter tang, but it finishes very clean and delicious  Pale Ale is a nice contrast to other styles in that I don't feel like I need to hang around and let it warm up in order to release hidden attributes. Like revenge, Sierra Nevada is sweet and best served cold. I drink it pretty fast and love every second of it. I cannot think of a more welcome Summer drink.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Not weak by any means but somehow manages to diminish down to no negative aftertaste very soon after swallowing. Clean aftertaste lingers indefinitely. Or should I say as long as you can resist taking another sip/gulp.  Mouthfeel: A LOT! going on for a brief moment passing through the mouth. Pleasant fizziness, real intensity of complex flavor. Body just right.  Drinkability: Highest possible drinkability!  I hadn't read all the other reviews when I first tried this recently. Bad reviews wouldn't have changed how much I liked this one but it did feel good anyway to see everyone else seemed to think highly of it too. I like the darker stuff too.

The aroma is evident even without putting your nose too close to the glass, and it's one that makes me salivate.  There is a hoppy, citrusy taste throughout, but the aftertaste is where this beer really shines. It is oh so crisp, and very hoppy and dry. Makes you want to smack your lips. This beer has a great mouthfeel as well, and you can tell that this beer has substance.  Sierra Nevada Pale Ale has recently grown to be my favorite all-around beer.

Massive frothy white head that maintained a strong lace until the last sip. The smell is a tightly balanced floral hop with a little bit of lemon. The taste is one of the most balanced of any pale ale I've had. The hops are up front. Floral and puckery but not overbearing. Even amount of malt flavor integrated in. Mouthfeel is light to medium body with just enough carbonation.  SN Pale Ale is a classic. I can easily session these all day, which I had the pleasure of doing over a weekend camping trip.

Once the whispy thin head recedes, it could easily be mistaken for sweet tea. Aroma is a nice mixture of sweet caramel, and piney hops. Flavor starts out with a big malty taste of caramel sweetness. Also some biscuit. Then you are heavily hit with both citrus and piney hops. Finishes crisp and dry. After the glass is drained you are left with hop burps and a longing for more.

140,276,joeskirkie,4.1,"A light amber body with a very good off-white head.  In this citrusy and leafy hop aroma, the citrus wins the contest. But the real winner is you, the drinker.  A wonderful bitterness on the tongue. It's by no means overpowering. It blends into the pale malt notes that follow, which then take a back seat to the bitterness once again on the finish.  It's nicely carbonated. If you ask me, this is the quintessential session beer.

This beer pours a slightly dark yellow, witha nice amount of head which remains quite nicely. Smells of hops, very mild smell, but in a good way, not empty, just mild. Tastes almost perfect, quite mild, but also very hoppy at the same time, a very very good balance. The only reason I took drinkability to 4.5 is because at 5.6% and how good this beer tastes, it's hard to keep yourself from getting drunk. Really premier beer, I like this one a lot... a lot.

Creamy, tasty-looking off-white head that laces up pretty well.  There's a signature American hop aroma of pine and grapefruity citrus. You can definitely tell it's there but it's not overbearing. A fine balance of pale malt and hops is found when drinking. But in the aftertaste, the hops have the last laugh with a lingering bitterness.  SNPA is medium-bodied, and I believe a bit oily from the hops used. Also, it goes pretty well with the pizza I just had.

140,276,AltBock,3.86,"12oz. stubby bottle with just a simple green label with a small picture of a mountain stream running through some trees. The neck label had all the information about the beer, except for a date. Above the barcode is a bottle number that would no use to the average consumer. The bottle was sealed with a twist off cap. After drink craft beer for well over a year, this is actually the first time I got to try this readily available beer.  Appearance: When poured into a mug, the beer was a nice golden copper color with an less than 1 inch head of fizzy white foam. The head of foam dissipated away not too fast leaving behind some fizzy rings and very little fizzy white lace.  Smell: I didn't get much of an aroma from this beer as I would have liked. All I got was an average smell of little citrus fruits with just a hint of bitter hops behind that. That's it, nothing more.  Taste: For such a highly produced beer, it had an excellent taste. The taste was that of citrus fruits in the beginning, then little toasted malt, and then finishes with a dry bitter hoppy taste. I was actually quite surprised that the taste would be this good.  Mouthfeel: It was light, not watery, smooth, carbonated, and with an aftertaste of dry bitter hops. What more can I ask for from this beer?  Drinkabaility: A great beer that's a must try and it wouldn't be hard to find it, it's almost everywhere in the US and at a good price too.

Sierra pours a nice golden, almost wheaty brown that hints at bready notes with a finger and a half foamy head.  The smell is pleasant, though limited. Floral hops dominate the scent with a some citrus mixed in.  The taste is clean with hops as the dominant flavor. It's a classic, very pleasant and enjoyable American Pale Ale.

Close to perfect, but I've had pales with a bit of a stronger presence in the nose. Malts are sweet but not cloyingly so. There isn't as much of the brightness I tend to associate with American pales. From the hops I get mostly citrus flavors with some floral notes. Perfect mouthfeel from a pale. Enough carbonation to keep it from being a still beverage, but it's not intrusive, on the other hand. Moderate body. Perfect ""session"" beer.

The beer is a classic pale ale with a slight citrus flavor to it. The mouthfeel is smooth and has that nice little bite of carbonation. This beer is completely drinkable, as I tend to have quite a few when I start on this beer.  The beer is great for summer and spring. Amazing bbq beer as it matches most food. Excellent beer to make a very excellent day...now where's my lawnchair?",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,shererjt,3.63,"Poured an orangish-yellow clear with an impressively thick head. Hops dominated the nose--grapefruit, baby!--but there was an underlying caramel sweetness that really made it work. Maybe a bit of mustiness that I didn't quite get. Yeast, perhaps? Flavor was well balanced; sweet malt, hop bitterness, and hop flavor were all there. Definitely had a strong cascade flavor, but not as prominent as I remember. Lively mouthfeel that was bursting with flavor--it was significant but not overpowering. The drinkability was quite good.  I like this beer a lot, though I have to say that it's not one of my all-time favorites.

Every so often, I have to buy this beer, it's in my blood. Classic looking APA, straw colored with an outstanding smell. This beer is like potato chips, can't just have one. Washes down with a smooth, hoppy goodness. Extremely smooth and crisp, with slight grapefruit flavoring. Nice head leaves some lacing down the glass.

140,276,jwff,3.88,"Nice looking beer.. for a pale this as close as it gets. This has very citric hops and some warm/dry malts in the smell. Taste is extremely close to the smell, but with a stickier body. Mouthfeel has the right amount of carbonation with hop/malt balance.

I'm glad some things change.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

I get a massive 2 inch head from my gentle pour (2 inches is too much in my oh so humble opinion) and a scant bit of lacing. Body is a shade below amber. Nose is pretty faint but brings to mind sweet caramel and grapefruit hops. Taste is at first sweet, then bitter then full of caramel and grapefruit. Very nice balance. Neither the malt nor the hops outshine the other. Mouth is rich and full.

Was a brown-orange color that was very nice to look at. unfortunately it smelt somewhat skunky, not very pleasing. The taste however made up for the smell. it had a full taste with a hint of bitter and rich aftertaste common in ales.

140,276,rabsten,4.83,"Sierra Nevada sets the bar for me. While I use Sam Adams Boston Lager as my benchmark, SNPA is probably the one I SHOULD be using.  Poured from a 24 oz bottle into an Imperial pint glass. Fluffy, khaki head on top of a copper body. The lacing is absolutely spectacular. Way back in 1987 or '88 I read the William Least Heat Moon essay on craft beer, ""A Glass of Handmade,"" wherein he pointed out how good beer leaves lines on the glass. He was talking about Seirra Navada products. Nice.  The hops in the brew are evergreen-y. Balsam more than pine. Citrus in there, too.  Taste. One of my favorite beers. Hard hop hit up front, mellowing into a malty middle, with a yeasty finish. Floral undertone. A total taste experince.  Feels light and crisp up front, and rounds out near the end without ever becoming heavy.  Drinkability. Well, lets say I've had several evenings lost when I've gone into a bar to get ""just one beer,"" only to find they have SNPA on tap or on special. I can drink this all weekend long.  Bottom line: If you're on this site, you already know how good this brew is. If it's not ""the best"" APA available, then it's sure damn near the top. Occasionally, I'll want someting different, APA-wise, like the excellent Great Lakes Burning River. But this beer Kicks Ass. And as a bonus, it's available everywhere!  Bob says go get some.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,EStreet20,4.27,"Wow I was looking over my reviews and realized I never sat down and reviewed this one. I fell in love with SNPA a few years ago before I knew what a craft brew was. Just tried it at a bar/restaurant that had a few ""different"" beers as I saw it back then. Def a go to beer for a nice pale ale that's available and inexpensive at my local liquor stores.  12 ounce bottle poured into a shaker pint glass.  A - Pours out a nice golden color with a two finger white head capping the beer to the top of the pint. Head sticks nicely and retains well.  S - A fresh citric hoppy smell along with a nice malty sweetness that lends a great balanced smell.  T - A nice subdued malty sweetness follows a nice rush of some citric and bitter hops. The beer finishes with nice bitter hops on the tongue.  M - Feels nice and slick and has a crisp carbonation.  D - A great session pale ale. Has a nice hop fix along with an interesting malt flavor coming through without anything overwhelming. Very drinkable.

140,276,KarlHungus,4.45,"This brew pours a brillant clear red color with a touch of bronze to it. The head is massive for a pale ale, creamy yet fluffy. The aroma is full of pine resin with a hint of orange underneath. The taste is more than I have grown to expect from a pale ale, and is more than the aroma lets on. It is full of pine, and has a nice lingering bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, I have been a BA living in America for almost a year now, and have to say that my biggest mistake in that year is not having tried this sooner. It might not be the best pale ale out there, but it is close to it. I will certainly buy this beer again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

A golden copper color with tons of bubbles of carbonation rising to the surface.  Not the most bold or fragrent nose but smells of citric and piney hops are present, they mingle with some faint sweet malts.  A solid and balanced taste, obviously the hops are most noticble with citric and piney flavors but they are nicely balanced out by the malts.  A crisp and refreshing mouth feel, medium bodied and nicely carbonated. A lot of ""fine"" carbonations, small bubbles popping all over your tongue.  A really solid beer and a great American Pale Ale. By far the best beer that I can find in my local super market.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,strattor,3.68,"Served to me in a pint glass a slightly cloudy golden-red with a white head.  Smell of citrus hops dominates.  Taste is of citrusy hops, but without much bitterness.

It would be easy to down a few of these without any problem.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,LarryV,3.97,"Pours a pale amber color with a 1/2"" head. Smell is piney hops. Taste is dominated by the hops followed by a slight hint of sourness. Malt backbone just barely balances out the hoppiness.  One of the hoppier pale ales on the market, and a decent session brew. Nothing really special about it, just a good, solidly brewed beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,indy169,3.25,"There was a time when this beer was one of my favorites. I thought it had great body, plenty of hops, and wonderful drinkability. Not the case any more. What happened to this once great brew? Appearance is still fine, deep golden color, respectable head with fair lacing. Smell of hops is much fainter than I remember, with no discernable direction. Taste is nothing special. Malty, but not too much & not too fresh tasting. Hops have no cajones. This is SN's #1 brand & it is simply average. Now, I don't know if the offerings from DogfishHead & Bell's have raised the bar beyond the reach of SN Pale Ale, or if SN changed it on us, but it does not seem nearly as special as it once did. I still love the Celebration Ale from SN.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

I had forgotten if I had tried it before, and was glad to get reacquainted with this excellent ale.  From the bottle, pours a red-orange/amber color with a copious foamy light tan head. Head fades at a moderate pace down to a thin sheet: good retention, and good lacing here. Nose is marked by a definite hops presence as well as some fruityapples and grapes, maybe. Taste is solid hops all the way back, bold, but not overdone or over-bitter. Mouth is watery but substantial; pretty decent. Finish is again hops with a light bitterness. Drinkability is good if you apprecate a hopsy ale.  Overall: A decent hopsy ale, recommended.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Sosh,3.28,"Finishing this beer as I type this. It poured into my glass a golden orangish color, with considerable head and a decent lace. I've seen this beer hyped up on this website and finally bought a six pack. This first beer I really enjoyed, but maybe it was all mental due to the hype. After finishing the 6 pack, I'm really not all that impressed. This plenty other beers I would buy over this.

140,276,cproioi,3.48,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a glass. A: Golden in color with a white head that produced decent lacing.  S: Smelled of citrus hops not a bad smell rather enjoyable.  T: When I have an American Pale Ale I wanted it to have alittle more hop's bitterness to it then this beer had. My findings is that American Pale Ales normally have a more hoppy bite to them then other types from around the world. However, not with this beer. It was just kind of there in taste. Nothing really stood out to me at all.  M: It was fine nothing thick at all but never once did I think of it as watery.  D: Relatively high. I would drink this again after doing work outside but other then that I can't see myself buying a bottle just for the hell of it.  End notes: I've heard a lot of people talking about how great this beer was. I guess I had my hopes up to high because it really didn't bring to me what I was hoping for. It's not bad by any means but more of it's not my favorite. I would never think of trying to talk somebody out of buying this.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,plaid75,4.47,"Poured a nice copper hue, with a one finger head. Good head retention and lacing.  The smell was rich with hop and grapefruit character. A light and airy aroma, which is inviting, in my experience, to non-craft drinkers.  The taste was crisp and dry. A very nice hop to malt balance, accented by grapefruit and flowery flavors.  The mouthfeel is crisp and clean, not too full and not too thin.  A very drinkable Pale Ale. In fact, I have found this to be a cross over beer for many people who are not experienced in craft brews.  In my opinion, a staple. I use this beer as a standard from which I measure every American Pale Ale I try. While few have exceeded this one in flavor and aroma, most fall short. Another plus is that it is readily available in most areas of the country I have visited.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Head is good initially, frothy 1/2'' which fades into a thin line. lacing is very above average and carbonation is persistent and even.  Smell = Decent nose although a bit subdued. What's there is nice though. Clean piney hops with some honey-like sweetness coming through behind.  Taste = Excellent APA. Perfect amount of hops..not enough to be an IPA but present enough to make a definite statement. Outstanding drinkability as flavor hits the perfect balance without being overwhelming nor watered down. Extremely well balanced. This should set the standard for APAs.  Overall = Probably the best ubiquitous beer you can find.

Well, gotta join the movement.  The color is amber golden and it pours with a finger of nice, thick foam. The smell is strong of grass, citrus, and a little roasted just like a PA should. The taste is an excellent balance between sweetness and bitterness with the latter taking over in the end. There's a tinge of chocolate in there too. Carbonation is just right. A friend to trust.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

The aroma is very strong but tends to be all over the place.  In the mouth, this is a wonderful PA. Layers and layers of hop character melded with just the right amount of sweet goodness. The taste spectrum is far ranging and there is always a nice nuance to find.  The feel is bold and full - creamy on the tongue with a nice crisp carb to keep it lively. It finishes dry and earthy - making you want more.  Musings: I am not a huge SN fan in general - but this is onebrew I almost always have around. It is a perfect summer brew - refreshing and brisk but still maintaining the depth.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Aroma was sweet malt, bread yeast, and mild hops at the end. Mouthfeel was full from the tiny carbonation, although I didn't notice any alcohol in the back as I swallowed. The taste was a slightly sweet malt with just a little hop bite and then the sweetness of the malts follow finishing very balanced tasting with a slight citrus drying at the end.

I had my first back in San Francisco in 97 and thought ""Wow the Americans do make good beer"". Canadian youth grow up with a lot of mythology about American beer based on things like Old Milwaukee and Coors.  I liked this so much I brought a few bottles home to Montreal with me. Fortunately it is widely distributed in the States so I always have some when I make a trip to Boston.

First taste and the hop bitterness is immediately recognizable. There is definitely a strong hop profile in this beer that is more apparent than the malts. Malty sweetness is faint but there, but that isn't what this beer is about.  Great, great beer for hop lovers, and beer lovers of all kinds need to try this one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Aromas are somewhat lackluster as nothing really jumps out at you. Somewhat hoppy, slight spicy characteristic.  But the taste is what truly makes this pale ale. Very balanced, with a good solid backbone of hop and malt. An interesting spicy wheat component is in this brew also.  The beer is very palatable and can help you through the long haul of a night especially if you end up at a non-beerfly type of establishment that doesn't have the best beer selection in town.  Very dependable especially at the price.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,ultralarry2006,4.1,"Poured from 12 oz.'er rendering nice head that recedes to surface skim. Hazy yellow amber. Slight amount of lacing. Aroma - Citrusy and some pine. Hint of bready malt. Taste - pretty much as promised by aroma; much citrus and bready malt very evenly balanced. Not especially as bitter as nose would have. Very clean finish. Mouthfeel - full, more carbonation than expected, slight hop slickness coating. Drinkabilty - could pound one after another, or just chill and sip. A good stand-by for hopheads when other things are scarce (owing to its wide availability), and a good gateway to hoppiness west-coast-style to the uninitiated; in short: an American classic and standard.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,sammy44,3.82,"A deep copper to amber color. Nice white head that hung around until the end. Tried two of these, one pouring the yeast into the glass and one without. I couldn't tell much difference except a liitle bit of cloudiness.  Smelled strongly of hops. A little citrusy and piney. A little more unbalanced toward the hops than what I think a pale ale should be. Almost into the IPA range. Nice full mouthfeel and fairly drinkable. All around a good beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Mebuzzard,4.42,"Poured into pint glass. A darker golden color with nice foaming head that did lace. Smell of hops and then some lemon and grass, maybe a pinch of ginger. A good taste. Balanced (or should I say imbalanced) just right for a PA. Hops are the main note, with malt and lemon in the background for body. Nothing special on the mouthfeel, but that's good anyway. Easy drinking, dangerous...can drink several without thinking of it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Graebner,4.4,"I realized that I had reviewed all sorts of strange beers, yet had never talked about my old and trusted friend Sierra Pale Ale. So here goes:  The appearance is good, but nothing to write home about. Pours out a yellow-amber with quite a bit of carbonation, lots of bubble column activity. The head peaks at two fingers of light fluffy froth, which diminishes to a paper-thin layer of white. Never judge a beer by its cover, though  The smell is where it starts to pique your curiosity. Lots of flowery hops, some citrus fruits and flowers, a little malty sweetness and some herbal nose. Makes you go ""eh?"" and scoot closer for a better angle.  The taste...mmmm, the taste. A little sour at first, maybe for a split second, then malty sweetness, then a crisp, clean, and ample hops finish. Also characters of citrus, herbs, a little spice, and some bready malt. It finishes very cleanly, though.  The mouthfeel is also superb. Carbonation on the front of the tongue, smooth over the middle, and a little more carbonation in the back. The hops also dry the back of your mouth and throat with their bitterness, but it's not at all unpleasant and contributes to the very balanced character of the beer.  The overall drinkability is phenomenal. Whether you are coming in from a hard day's work or school and just want to sit and sip, or you're out with the lads for the evening and need a session ale to accompany you, you can hardly go wrong with the Sierra Pale Ale. I could drink this morning, noon, and night, then pass out, and drink it noon and night the next day as well. It's that good. In my opinion this is simply the best widely-available (as in gas station) beer you can buy. I'm proud to call it my friend.  An interesting note: I recently discovered that, when enjoyed out of a glazed clay mug, one gets an even better taste out of this beer. It seems the clay and/or the shape of the mug (slightly bulbous at the bottom with a narrower neck, in this case) brings out more flavor. Either that, or I just got an exceptionally good bottling. Give it a try.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,cheers2beers,4.18,"This beer pours a nice golden straw/amber combo with a white head that didn't stack up. Very little laceing is noticed along with a slow and steady column of beading. The aromas are grassy,floral,and some sour fruits. The flavors are simply fantastic. A nice hop character balanced with these sour fruits and herbal/floral notes make up a great taste that beckens me to drink more. A slick grainy liquid goes down very easy for a most splendid quaff. I have had this pale ale on many occasions now and found out that there is no wrong time to drink it.Goes great with dinner, and even better while your working out in the yard.Sierra Nevada is obviously doing something right!

The color was a nice medium amber color.  The aroma of this beer was slighty floral with a nice fruit smell.  The taste was very good, a nice crisp bitter taste intially with a nice mouth feel. A light malty flavor and with a very nice complimenting hooppy flavor. This was finished with a nice bitter aftertaste.  All in all a good beer and it seems to be available more and more places on draft, so that is good for every one.

140,276,dreadnatty08,3.59,"Pours a light caramel color. Super bubbly and topped off with a fluffy white head. Aromas of that nice grapefruity Cascades, so distinct with SN. Also a bit of a biscuity malty background. This is perhaps one of the most balanced beers I've had. Hops are assertive, yet not overpowering. That bready malty character gives it great body and complimentary flavors. This is a perfect everyday beer as it doesn't get in the way of foods nor is it boring. However, I feel it's a bit too syrupy on the tongue, a little out of character for this style. Would also like to see some more dry hopping for additional aromas. Overall, a rather average beer, not my favorite of SN.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Crosling,2.26,"Amber color with a large covering cream. Stinky, doughy and sweaty yeast aroma, which hints of medicine and vitamins, unsuccessfully attempts to disguise itself with a lightly aromatic, herbaceous and floral hop scent. Light caramel in the nose as well, but pretty much just stinky yeast and dulled hops. I still find the yeast character to be obtrusive upon tasting, though not as bad as the aroma. The malt flavor is very light and grainy and to me, doesnt blend well at all with the mildly aggresive hop flavor and bitterness. The hops which shift from herbaceous, to floral to piney (on the finish) are moderately pleasing, but overall, this is just a poorly balanced beer, plus the yeast stinks or something.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,BigBry,4.1,"Finally got to try the famous SNPA, on a recent trip south of the border. One of the specialty selections available at the Wildhorse Saloon in Nashville. Enjoyed a 12 oz bottle with lunch. Nice, light orange color with an short white head. Smell of lots of hops, and a hint of pine - perfect for the style. It tastes of a lot of hops, some lemony citrus, some pine, some floral, but all well balanced. This is a hop-lovers delight. This feels great in the mouth. The carbonation is not overdone, the brew has a creamy consistancy. Its complex with lots of flavors, but not over the top, making a very drinkable American Pale Ale.

140,276,brewdlyhooked13,4.5,"Original review (10/10/02) What can I say? This beer is well known by anyone who has been bold enough to venture outside the confines of American megabrewers. A wonderful teasing light aroma that gets the mouth watering *right now*. Initial taste sends the citrusy components evenly across the palate. The hop bitterness patiently waits its turn, then smoothly transitions the mouth experience, allowing one to easily pick up the full hop flavor. Outstanding. Once it all subsides, there is just enough trace bitterness residue in the mouth that it begins to act like a magnet to whatever vessel currently holds the remainder of the brew. I can't explain it, kinda like the commercial says, 'It's like (beer) science, you can't mess with science"". An experimental beer aged for 3+ years...  Appearance - pours a honeyed orange/gold color, quite nice. A quick life to the head, it leaves a few nice ropes of lace but quickly ends up a loose cover. 3.5  Aroma - a rather average hop aroma, mildy citric, decidedly underwhelming.2.5  Taste - ahhhh, that's more like it. A brief play of sweet malts, swept over by the appropriate wave of piny hops, enough to keep this beer fresh for quite a long boat ride. Ends with a strong grapefruit rind finish which become more prominent as the beer warms. All the requisite elements of the long program have been met with minimal deduction (my ode to the '06 Olympics). Yum. 4.5  Mouthfeel - hefty carbonation, sturdy body. 4.5  Drinkability - my palate tends to tire of IPA after a while but this is one I could drink several of. 4.0",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Enola,3.63,"This is a beer that you can find almost anywhere. The color is a light amber. There was little head. The smell is like a fresh cut pine tree. The taste is fairly bitter. The mouthfeel is filled with lingering bitterness. I could session these but this is not my favorite from the style. All in all, an average beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Phatz,4.31,"This is one of the easiest drinking beers I have had. It is a very mild beer that is not a bring out the fireworks beer, in any individual aspects; but the simple pure fact that it is so easy going makes it a perfect choice for just about any occasion. I had chili tonight and it was great next to that. It is also great next to burgers and dogs or BBQ chicken. It is a great party beer that is easy to simply accept and enjoy with out much thinking. From time to time I like beers that are puzzling, then other times you just want an approachable, sessionable easy beer like SNPA. Here's the breakdown:  Appearance: Pours a golden amber slightly orange hue. Small white head with decent retention. Plenty of active carbonation bubbles.  Smell: The smell is not as large as I would have expected. It is subdued but very pleasant. Slightly toasted malt aroma, a suggestion of white bread and a hint of citrusy hops.  Taste: Initially the taste appears straightforward because it is *so* easy to accept. Upon further contemplation I realize it is simply so well balance that you easily miss its beautiful layers. Slightly citrusy around the edge but marvelously malty through the center; this is a beer for swirling in the mouth. There seems to be a slight hint of toastyness through the malt character but the hops make it seem so bright it is simply brilliantly blended. The aftertaste is fantastic! It is layered, like the front end, with sweet first followed by tingly hoppyness that really encourages you to take the next sip. mmm! Very good stuff!  Mouthfeel: So creamy and smooth yet crisp and especially dry finish. Marvelous!  Drinkability: I think I have already established that the drinkability here is exceptional. This beer is easy and pleasant to drink! The epitome of Quaffable. This my new everyday (no-thinking) beer. I highly recommend it for your next party or cookout or to simply have on hand when you want to knock back something and dont want to have to think about what your in the mood for. It is a good fall back always-appropriate selection IMO.  Hope this is helpful! Cheers!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,ReDave,4,"One of my favorite ""standard"" ales. I try to keep some on hand at all times. If i go to a bar or restaurant, this is my fall-back if they have nothing else special.

140,276,Rezzin,3.65,"This is the beer that got me started on craft brews and it's been a long time since I had one. I picked up a sixer today just to have some 'old faithful' on hand.  A - Pours an amber / orange with a soft white head that drops fairly quickly. I need to change dish soap I think.  S - Fruity and citrusy with a slight malty background. Not as hoppy as I recall but it might be because of the beers I've been drinking as of late.  T - Fruity and mild. Hmm... I'm wondering if I have a bad bottle. It's almost tasting somewhat metallic. Easy drinking and good despite the metallic flavor. Perhaps I'm mistaking the citrus for metallic? Nice and crisp with a tiny bit of bitterness at the end.  M - Well carbonated. Smooth yet somewhat on the thin side to me.  D - Well, this went from my favorite to a fairly regular beer. Too many craft brews have destroyed my pallete. Easy drinking APA but no longer as hoppy as I'd prefer in my APA's.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,thepitch,4,"A special beer to me. The first craft brew I ever had, this beer cultivated my taste for hoppy brews. If I could rate this beer based on memory alone, it would be straight 5's all the way. But, let's get on with it.  Presentation is awesome. I love the fresh-looking green label.  Poured the beer into a pint glass. It formed a small, white head that faded relatively quickly. It has a nice, but not robust, clear, copper color.  Initially, it smells great. A spicy, floral bouquet of hops. The beer tastes good, but not as good as I remember; maybe my tastes are changing, or maybe this is from a bad batch. Hoppy, spicy, floral, bitter but lacking in overall body with a quickly diminishing aftertaste. It tastes like an awesome beer, but maybe a bit watered down.

Not really all that bitter, but did have a nice little bite to it as you swallow. Rather dry at the finish, but leaves a citrusy kind of aftertaste.  M- Feels at home on the palate. Not complaining though, cause it doesnt deter that taste or make it hard to swallow. Slighlty coarse at finish.  D- I would very much enjoy drinking a sixer of this stuff.

The smell is hop heaven - extremely floral - nearly intoxicating in itself. Mouthfeel is not thick but neither is it watery - I'd say just right. Taste is similar to aroma: a trace of sweet malt quickly balanced by floral hop tones and bitterness but with a very clean finish. The cascades really linger on in the nose - wonderful aroma without the lingering bitterness of some beers.  Exceptionally fine beer - has become a staple in my fridge.

Taste is just about perfectly balanced, the malt and hops (pine & grapefruit come to mind) complement each other, not fight each other for dominance. There's a lingering hoppy aftertaste, but again, not overpowering. Mouthefeel is smooth, not heavy or watery, and it would be oh so easy to down one after another as a session brew, as I have many a time during football season. A nice, solid, dependable brew for all...just enought oomph for craft brew lovers, but wouldn't overpower a macro drinker that you're trying to win over.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Taste is also refreshing. A little fruit maybe at the beginning of the sip...then the hopps give it a nice crisp finish. This is a fairly carbonated beer that makes your tongue tingle. Drinkability: This is a beer that I tried a long time ago and did not really care for. I decided to give it another try and I purchased a bomber. I still was not so sure of it, but my the end of the 24oz I began to appreciate the hopps(for this reason it got a 4.5 on taste). This beer opened me up to many others, and I feel that it is now my standard for american pale ales.

The beer pours a slightly hazy, dark golden color with a pillowy one inch head. Aroma is hoppy and fruity with plenty of citrusy smells too.

This is backed by a balanced malt that is rather basic.  The taste is well balanced as well. A good malt base supports a aggressive sweet citrus hop taste up front. This is mixed well with carbonation that is leveled just right. The hop characteristic lasts through and finishes with more of a floral taste. There are hints of pine and earthiness to it as well.

140,276,akahn,3.83,"Amber golden color with lots of streaming bubbles. Off-white head of big bubbles. Sticky and lasts as an irregular skim. Some spotty lacing.  Mellow citric hop aroma, with a broad citric hop flavor. This beer has a serious hop bite, bitter, but not offensively so. Barely a hint of malt coming through, expressing itself as an underlying sweetness. This shows up more as the beer warms. Juicy, rather than dry.  Affirmative supporting carbonation that compliments the hops well, and a solid medium body.  Definitely drinkable, sessionable, but speaking from countless experiences this eventually leads to a sticky, unpleasant feeling in the mouth. But I guess that's a problem with lots of hoppy beers. This is probably THE beer that got me interested in beer, and returning to it after a long time was interesting. This beer is the same as I remember it, but I can appreciate it even more now.

The hops are obviously the focus of the beer but this does not prevent the beer from preventing some delightful sweet and toasted malts. Again the normal floral/citrus hops are most prevalent but once the beer is tasted the citrus flavor seems to dominate. The mouthfeel is carbonated well with some nice thickness. There is also a welcome dimension of bitterness associated with this beer. Overall I really enjoy this one and have to give it a 5 on drinkability. This is one I will come back to again and again.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,DarkerTheBetter,3.68,"This beer pours an apricot honey color with a thin white head that left a nice frosting of lace. Smells of muddy oats, wheat, green grass and pine along with some musky lager-like tones. The malt base of this tastes like doughy wheat crackers of some sort, or perhaps rye crisps with a bit of straw. The hops bring out a definite grapefruit dryness but also lets in a little green grape and blueberries. The finish awkwardly transitions to a sterile dryness that almost mandates another sip. The mouth feel is light to medium bodied with lots of light carbonation that I found to be a bit distracting. This is a nice mellow blend of flavors that is a bit to dry in the end for my liking.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Big, off-white bubbles settle down into a little pool foam. Slightly hazy, some yeast in there.  S - citrus, grapefriut, muscadines. Toasted malt in the background. Strong cascade hop aroma.  T - bitterness right up front. Tart. Citrusy, flowery flavor of hops dominate then give way to light, toasty malt backbone. Hop flavor very present. Tastes like you're eating a grapefruit. Biscuity, toasty malt there, pretty balanced. Dry.  M - moderately thin body. Moderate to low carbonation.  D - highly, highly drinkable beer.

140,276,Citadel82,4,"This has become my ""go to "" brew for all occasions. Tough to beat it pricewise as well as for flavor. It is spicy and hoppy and has enough of a malt backbone to make it interesting.

140,276,arguemaniac,4.4,"Pours a crystal clear amber color with a brief, foamy head that leaves behind thin and sporadic lace. Caramel and citrusy hops in the nose. The flavor features a superb balance between malt and hops: smooth caramel along with a grainy pale malt flavor that, like many great American pale ales, has a slight but distinct apricot fruitiness. There is crisp citrus hop flavor that provides a nicely balancing bitterness. Hop spice and some toffee in the finish. The mouth feel is smooth with fairly active carbonation.  In my opinion, its one of the best beers out there, for a variety of reasons: its infinitely drinkable, its tasty enough for the even the most serious craft beer purist to enjoy but approachable enough that even the most committed swill drinker can appreciate it and, to top it all off, its widely available on draft and in bottles (six-packs, 12-packs, and even bombers!). For all these reasons, its one of the best beers to recommend when turning macro drinkers onto better beer. Highly, highly recommended.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,VoodooBrew,4.1,"The beer that started it all, or so they say.  SNPA is crisp, clean, very drinkable, and nicely hoppy. The nose is bright citrus, mild grapefruit, and some piney notes. We find these elements again in the palate, with of course more of a pronounced bitterness, chased by a tartness that takes residence on the sides of the tongue.  While I'd be fine with, say, a Dogfish Head 60 Minute for session purposes, SNPA is still thoroughly enjoyable as a crisp, easy-drinking APA with enough flavor to satisfy the discriminating beer drinker.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,TheManiacalOne,4.1,"24oz. bottle poured into a pint glass.  A: Pours an amber color, with a very thin, quickly dissipating white head. However it leaves a bit more lace than you would think, given the thinness of the head.  S: The hops aroma is what prevails in the smell with some malt and a bit of citrus. Nice blend.  T: The malt comes out a little bit more in the taste, but the hops is still the dominant flavor. There’s a slight bitterness, but it’s not unwelcome. Almost no after-taste, which I would image, is mostly due to fact that malt seems to be used sparingly. I consider that a good thing in this case.  M: Smooth, but crisp, very well-balanced with a nice finish, medium carbonation.  D: Not very filling, definitely a beer that you can go with for a long while in one night.  Overall this is an excellent beer. It’s very straight-forward and doesn’t try to blow you away or try to hide anything.

A really perfect color, what a beer should look like. The smell was slightly citrus, but mostly of the hop and malt combination. The taste would be just as you would imagine from its scent, mostly the great combination of the malt and hops, with some bitter citrus to it. This leaves the most prominent element to the aftertaste- bitter, but in the good way, lingering on the tongue. As I continued the head disapated to a quater inch head leaving some lacing as it went. A decent amount of carbonation, not enough to take away from the taste, and also a good mouthfeel to it, not watery at all.  Overall, I think this would be a great beer to drink as an all around refreshing beer. Pleanty of taste to keep you drinking, with a good amount of carbonation and a crisp taste to the finish. A wonderful pale ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,Metalmonk,3.91,"As far as easily-accessible, ubiquitous beers go, this is one of the best. Found in smalltown groceries and dive bars, as well as more upscale establishments, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is a great everyday/session beer. Affordable, tasty, accessible.  A good pour results in a soapy head atop a beautiful amber/copper body. Sometimes I just love to look at this one. The smell is unremarkable, only very faint hops present, citrus too faint (considering the orange-y hint in the flavor), but once past the lips this hoppy ale has a satisfying flavor, citrus-y, a pleasing and slightly bitter pinch on the back of the tongue. Refreshing in the mouth (an excellent summer beer) but if it stays too long it gets a bit tart. I drink this as a ""daily beer"" since lots of my favorite stuff is usually too precious to bust out every single day, which is why I've rated the drinkability high. Never gets old. Considering the local choices, I'll take this over mega-brewery headache-beer anyday.

140,276,nickss,4.1,"Guess it's about time I reviewed this bad boy, since it is usually my fall-back brew when I go out and they have the normal selection. Not a bad fall-back at all if you ask me.  Yellowish-Orange hue with a fluffy 1"" head.... constant stream of bubbles ascend to the surface, giving hint to the carbonation levels.  Lots of hop in aroma... floral citrus. Surprisingly, there is a significant malt aroma as well.  Nicely hopped, lots of citrus... well balanced. A classic. A wonderful session brew.  I would like it to have a bit less carbonation in it, but the thickness of the beer is perfect.  Could drink this beer all day and all night.... Sierra Nevada is consistently one of the least appreciated brewers for what they do in my opinion. I feel that people consistently overlook them when comparing them to other great craft brewers simply because of their size.

140,276,RJLarse,3.46,"I have long shied away from this beer, probably because of the packaging. Something about the label and carton does not appeal to me, probably the bright green. But I saw its overall rating (recommended) on BA and had to give it a try. I poured this one into a pint tumbler.  Pours a shiny copper or rich gold color, with a thin but resilient white head. The beer is quite clear, with a few streams of bubbles rising through it.  The smell is sharp and clean. It smells of hops and faintly like yeast. The smell of malt is not detectable.  The taste is complex, strong taste of hops up front, with mellow malt flavor to follow, and then a very resilient hop and malt aftertaste. There is a remarkable balance in the taste, and it is hard to choose a dominant taste characteristic.  Mouth feel is good, rich robust flavors, none of which are overpowering. But the taste and the beer in general is a little heavy.

I must say from the onset that I was certainly not disappointed!  Poured from the bottle into an oversized wine glass, a sizeable, bubbly head quickly formed and almost as quickly dissipated, leaving no lacing to speak of... only a ring around the rim of the glass, and an island in the middle that was maintained throughout my drink by several rows of carbonation at the bottom of the glass.  The smell was amazingly fruity. Orange rind, grapefruit, and a hint of pineapple even before my nose was above the glass.  The first sip was sharp and assertive citrus and hops, with a brief but pleasant attack of fiz on the lips. Finish is bitter and more citrus, but seamlessly moved into a gentle floral bouquet... here I had to think for a moment, but the most memorable and lingering flavour was reminiscent of rose hip. Simply delicious.  Mouthfeel is a little thin but bolstered by an immediate burst of carbonation. It would be quite quaffable if not for the desire to savour every flavour.

140,276,casualbeerman,4.05,"Of all my older reviews, this is probably the one that I tanked the worst. I originally rated this slightly below average (I think I had it at 2.9 overall). Sierra Nevada Pale Ale isn't perfect, but it was worth a higher rating than that. It's kind of ironic, over the years its become a pretty consistent choice for me. At the time I felt like it was just too much: too bitter, too thick, it took me what at least felt like a half hour to drink a single bottle. This can definitely take some getting used to if you've been raised on lighter beers. What can I say? I was 22 when I wrote the review. So anyway, what do I think of it 13 years later?  Appearance is attractive. A nice dark color brown, and a thick, stable creamy head that lasts. I remember being vaguely annoyed that this ""pale ale"" wasn't very pale at all when I first sampled this. I didn't learn till later that all ""pale ale"" really means is ""pale compared to porter"".  Smell is one of the strong points: It has a nice, fresh, slightly sweet smell that is dominated by those cascade hops: a little citrusy, a little, piney, even a little turpentiney.  Taste (as is pretty typical) follows the smell. A clean, strong malt backbone, yeast that is usually more clean than funky, and those citrusy, piney, slightly tar-like, sometimes vaguely raspberry-like cascade hops. The bitterness is assertive, and taste-wise that's what turned 22 year old me off. Today it usually doesn't bother much, though I'm still unlikely to kill a sixpack of this even with the next day off and someone else to drive me home. Overall this is mostly very good. It's pleasant, well balanced, fairly complex. It's essentially the blueprint for mainstream American craft brews for a reason, and how an American beer with quality ingredients will taste: IE some sort of riff on all 2 row barley strongly flavored with whole cone Cascade hops. Fans of the trendy American IPA's will probably generally appreciate this (at least as a fallback/session brew) as most IPA's I've tried basically taste like Seirra Nevada turned up to 11 (or maybe 10.5 because this is already a hoppy beer that has above average alcohol conent) On the other hand, lovers of popular English style ales (which to most are THE prototypical ales) might be disappointed as this doesn't share all of their characteristics (I've never got any Diacytle notes and don't get many fruity Ester notes out of Sierra Nevada). Not saying its better or worse than a good English ale like Bass, just different.  I left the score for mouthfeel low. This beer can get heavy on me quickly. Its still not my go-to for a session beer on a hot day. Maybe I'm giving you a sage review here or maybe I'm just a pussy. It's a yummy beer though, so my advice is try one and decide for yourself.  Overall, I upped my rating to 4.25. This is a generally tasty beer that I rarely regret ordering. Its almost always fresh-tasting, its complex, it just works. Sure its way too strong if you like say Coors Light, probably kind of wimpy if you mostly drink Imperial Stout, but for most of us who are somewhere in between its generally a solid choice.

The label says it's bottle conditioned, so I expected it to be a little hazy. Finger and half head that lasts. Lively carbonation is visible.  Scent is pleasant, not overpowering. Citrusy hops and a little yeast. Could be a little stronger, but not bad at all.  Taste is also very pleasant. A little lemon at the back of the throat with some wheat and grain flavors throughout. Just a hint of hop bitterness at the finish. It's not a ridiculously strong flavor, but it's very enjoyable. Really quite tasty.  Light to medium body on the tongue. Very clean feeling. Goes down quick and easy. Carbonation is light. Feels quite quaffable.  Seems like an infinitely drinkable beer to me. Everything about it is tasty, but there's not too much of anything. It's extremely well-balanced. I almost want to describe it as subtle. It would be an excellent choice with food, as it wouldn't overpower it, but does a decent job of cleaning the palate. If I was drinking just for the sake of drinking, I would want more, but there's nothing wrong with this brew.  **Edit** Had another bottle of this today (1-4-06) and it was hazy with clearly visible yeast that even settled a little at the bottom of the glass.

Smell: Pleasant hoppy aroma imbued with some leafiness. A roasted maltiness also reveals itself in the scent of this beer.  Taste: The hops are less pronounced than the smell leads on. Still some palpable bitterness, but definitely subdued. The hops impart a certain pungent flavor, very much like lush grass. The malts are quite evident, present in toast-like flavor. There is some definite sweetness intermixed, maybe a trace of citrus.  Mouthfeel: Light-bodied, with good carbonation. Finishes a bit watery, which is a detriment.

Also, one of the few brews that introduced me to the craft beer level.  Pours a hazy orange/amber in color with a nice head that sticks around as long as I could possibly want it to.  The nose is absolutely bursting of floral and citrus hops. Smells scrumptious and delicious. Just a beautiful smelling hoppy ale.  The taste is marvelous. If I had my eyes closed, I'd believe there was 1/2 a grapefruit sitting in the bottom of the glass. The excited citrus hop flavors graciously slide down the hatch. This one tastes almost rough and rugged at first swig, but after the first few sips, it eases up on you and becomes quite drinkable.  The mouthfeel is medium-bodied with perfect carbonation. Maybe even a touch bigger than medium-bodied.  Drinkability is great too. It gets mellower and mellower the more you drink.  Plain and simply a true american classic, and one of my favorites.

140,276,BamaScholar,4.1,"With nearly 700 reviews of this ubiquitous converter of macro-drinkers already here, there isn't too much more to say about this bad boy.  It's more amber in colour than one would expect.  Smell and taste are non-pretentious...good floral hop aroma with strong hop taste but not exclusively so. Lingering malt squeaks in with a caramel drizzle and homey bready finish.  It's hard to go wrong with this one, folks. Not perfect, by any stretch, but good for having just one or several, and a good balance of flavours.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,jslot38,4.2,"12 oz Stubby Bottle.  Well, often times I've floated through the site and seen people get pumped up about their 100th, or 1,000th beer review... this is my 10th, and I choose one of my favorite kick back beers for it.  Appearance: Pours a clear copper with amber hues. Inch and 1/2 off white foamy head. Slowly disappates. Intermitant lacing.  Smell: Floral hops aroma power through your nostrils. A grained spiceness floats about. Lovely.  Taste: Such a great use of hops. This is one where you don't feel as if the hops have you by the neck (although I appreciate those at times), and yet remindes you of its style. Lovely esters and floral notes linger right on through a slightly biscut malt background. However, the whole hops are certainly the primary flavour, and are done to near perfection.  Mouthfeel: Although the hop rush up front might make you wonder to the mouthfeel of this beer, its level of carbonation and malt background, and the nature of the hops allow for a great mouthfeel.  Drinkability: Not filling, not too alcoholic, not too too hoppy, not too malty, a perfect mix which adds to a great drinkability. This is one that I'd pair with Dogfish Head's 60 minute that goes as a great 'session' Pale Ale.  Notes: One of the first craft beers I ever had, and while that night I was turned away, I've grown to love this beer, a great introduction to a great style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

D- Extremely drinkable!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,jaluria,3.68,"A light brown color with a golden hue that has an off-white colored head that dissipates quickly. Aromas of grapefruit, pine, and hops seem to come out. The taste is typical for this style with a mildly astringent mouthfeel due to the hop bitterness. Nothing about this beer is overpowering which makes for a very good session beer or a relaxing beer. Good example of the style; perhaps a bit too sweet in the finish. A solid beer that is readily available in many areas.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,maddamish,3.67,AP: This is a very good pale ale. Amber in color. Almost no head to speak of. Even with an aggressive pour this was no lacing to speak of.  Smell: Orange pulp and hops  Taste: This beer is one big hop bomb with a hint of orange peel. This is a very complex beer.  Mouth Feel: Very smooth. A bit watery but nothing to complain about.

The quality and consistency of this beer is impeccable.  Getting into the wonderful world of craft-beer, this was my first true love, and will always be one of my all-time favorites.  For anyone getting into micro brews, this beer is going to seem like a kick in the face, with its standout cascade hop character. It certainly was for me. Funny - after a while, and many other beers tried, the hops now seem finely tuned and very well balanced.  Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is refreshing, vibrant, alive.

Bitter, but not overly so, balanced well. Has a slightly bready finish.  M: Medium body, flows over tongue easily, nice carbonation. Bitterness really hits at the back of the palate.

140,276,Pepeton,4.5,"Well, well, well... It's been a long time since I had a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Four years, almost to the day. So this review might be biased; actually it is. And since I still have 4 bottles left of it waiting for me I'll rush this review.  Pours a nice orange, golden with a compact white head and beautiful lacing.  Citrusy hop smell surge from my glass, some malts too. Even some spicyness  Taste is amazingly crisp for an ale and medium bodied; I detect something that I haven't noticed before: Faint flavor of turpentine? Pine or Fir sap? Some sort of tree oil? But good.  Great bitter aftertaste that I missed so much (is quite an ordeal to get fine beers down here in México!)  Absolutely great drinkability. Actually I'm going after the remaining four.  ¡Salud!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,bighoppymonster,3.95,"Pours a dark, orangy straw colour with a nice foamy slightly offwhite head. Sharp hops in nose also with some grainy aspects as well. Smooth taste rolls down the throat with some nice hop bitterness on back of the palatte. Slighlty metallic aftertastes linger long after you swallow. Overall an excellent APA.

140,276,JerzDevl2000,4.57,"All hail the king of pale ales! This is great stuff - hands down. Pours nicely, deep gold with a bit of copper in the color, and one of the best aromas I've ever smelled in a beer; very full and fruity. Head fluffed up nice and high, all the way to top of my pint glass. All this before the first sip!  Very smooth mouthfeel, almost buttery with just a touch of lemon. The right amount of hops counterbalances a wonderful base almost perfectly. Slight amount of haze even a few minutes after the pour from the yeast that was on the bottom of the bottle. Very simple, and yet very complex at the same time. Smooth, hoppy, and a flagship for pale ales. Simply amazing!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,FirstMan,3.8,"When you are on a business trip in Washington D.C., it can sometimes be hard to stick to your mantra of drinking local. Especially when you're trapped in a hotel near the mall in McLean, Virginia. I spent probably a good hour trying to find a bar that had anything other than the regular macro selection. I wonder what the wait-people must have thought of me when I came up, asked what their draft list was, and then had my face glaze over as they went through the list - Bud, Bud Light, Coors, Bass, Harp, ...  At any rate, I finally found a place that ended the list with ""...Sierra Nevada, Guinness"", so I sat down.  I was served the Sierra Nevada in a frozen glass, which just isn't classy, but I tried really hard to see beyond that. Once the condensation was wiped off, I could see that this was nice and clear.  This is a pale on the darker side - slight pumpkin and amberish tones. Nice head stayed around for a quite a while and left little tracings along the edge as it went down.  Nose is full of aroma hops, with slight toasty grain essence in the back.  Taste is clean and light with a really nice citris hop bitterness that is slightly unbalanced when it's below temperature, but evens out as it warms up. I kept thinking ""fresh"" while I was drinking this - whatever that means (no, I am not an early 90s rap star).  Mouthfeel is slightly creamy with sharp tingle of carbination evening it out.  Overall this is a great stand-by beer. If you can find it in the wasteland of beer that exists below the Mason-Dixon line, I advise you drink it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,daliandragon,3.28,"Enjoyed this today at Traxx bar in Penn Station after a day of hanging out in the city and watching my girlfriend run the NYC marathon. We had a few minutes before catching the train back to suburbia and her brother was buying so I figured I'd give this original microbrewer a shot. This pale ale features an attractive golden/copper color and only a trace of head. The nose is very mild, with hints of hops and a fresh characteristic but mostly a mystery. The flavor is full bodied and rolls nicely across the tongue. It's not bad at all but not very special either. It's hoppy and crisp and tasty but still tastes somewhat generic. The taste is also marred by far too much carbonation in the mouthfeel. This is not a bad beer, but for the price and the brewer's reputation I'd like to see a more individual taste. I hate to to mention it but I wonder if Sierra Nevada is still at the top of their game..",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,mcnut,3.6,"Sierra Nevada makes a good beer, sometimes the problem is that all of their beers taste remarkably similar.  Now its not fair for me to say all of them, as I've only tried their porter and the pale ale. Other than color, the taste was shockingly similar, well lets get to that.  The pale ale is just that, a pale golden beer with a soft lacing of head. The smell of hops and some citrusy notes comes out in the first whafting, with more hops to follow.  The taste is very strong of hops and a mild alchohol aftertaste.

The hope smell was evident on the initial palate that transcended to a bitter finish that had a fruity /citrus undertone. The carbonation was fine and it was smooth in the mouth.

Smell: medium to strong hops with maltiness. Taste: strong bitterness when cold. Sweet malts are present, but barely. Finishes with strong clean bitterness.

Nice malt balance with a bitter aftertaste that is enjoyable. Just a very nice smooth pale ale that goes down incredible easy.

The appearance is copper heaven. There's a light/small white head that doesn't seem to last all that long. The smell is slightly metallic but more ""beery"" and floral. I can taste the hops before they hit my palate.  The taste is smooth, vibrant, and refreshing. There's just enough hop bite to make you go ""Ahhh!"". Drinkability is a bit of an issue as my mouth becomes increasingly dry and by tastebuds ever spent after each bottle.  This is a must try, no matter what your tastes are!

140,276,asabreed,4,"12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass.  Appearance: This beer looks great in a glass. A weird brown and amber which is nice to look at. If it's at the right temperature it leaves a pretty good head on top and some spidery lacing on the glass.  Smell: Some slight sweet malt and burst of piney and oily hops. Very floral, and very engaging.  Taste: Almost IPA strength with the hops, though the malt presence seems to balance it out pretty well. The piney hops are at the forefront, and it settles down then into a yeasty and malty, slightly dry finish.  Mouthfeel: Moderately thicker body, it seems, for a pale ale, though the carbonation -- which seems to be on the heavy side -- makes it easy for sipping, and makes it very easy to drink.  Drinkability: Certainly a widely available beer on tap around the U.S., I think at least. Worth a shot, since some say this is one of the best pale ales made. Though I'm slightly inclined to disagree, I do think it's a widely available beer that I'm thankful is widely available.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

T - Not very hoppy in taste, but finishes with a bit of pine bitterness in back. Again, not as bitter as I like, but this is an APA sent to the masses, so it needs that lighter touch.  M - One of the cleaner, and smoother hop bears you'll find. This is mainly designed to be, but makes it a very easy going beer.  D - Many things factor in its high drinkability, being ABV, ease of drinking and frankly cost. At maybe $6 a six pack that is a great beer when you want to watch a game with the guys, but still drink a good beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Mouthfeel: Crisp carbonation with a dry finish that makes you want to drink this brew all night long.  Drinkability: Extremely easy to drink, cleanses the palette quite well with bold food flavors.

The foam lasts for awhile and the buble quality is high- the small bubbles make for a very creamy head. Smell is very refreshing, an enticing blend of citrusy fruit, with perhaps a hint of yeast. Taste follows through with the smell, refreshing notes of citrus. The malts are good, something about this beer reminds me of bread. Mouthfeel is excellent; it's thick, rich, and satisfying. Later into the sip the hops really kick in, with a bitterness that challenges the senses but doesn't repel. Quite drinkable, this beer can be effortly paired with basically anything. Not exactly a session beer though, as you really want to take the time to enjoy each bottle.

Pours a brilliantly clear orange/copper color with a half-inch of fluffy white head that has pretty good retention.  Smells of Cascades and more Cascades!!! lovely floral hop aroma to say the least. There is a slight hint of caramel malt in the nose, but the hops absolutely dominate. Love that smell.  Taste: Huge piney/floral hop flavor smacks me in the face, followed by a slight nutty malt flavor that is soon overwhelmed by more hop bitterness, followed by a thirst-quenching dry finish that leaves me wanting more.  Mouthfeel: medium-high carbonation and medium body give this beer a great mouthfeel.

Light on the malt in aroma.  Taste: Very light bready malt, with spicy and bitter hops in the middle and the finish. Stood up well to my spicy sausage and double Glouscester cheese.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, for a pale ale. I'd expect this kind of mouthfeel with a stout or a porter, but in an APA this is a very pleasant surprise.  Drinkability: This would be an excellent session beer; I could drink it all day, even with all the hop flavor I'm picking up, due to the fact that the hops enhance the experience, rather than pummelling the tastebuds.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

When I twist the glass the streams of bubbles twist, pretty sweet. Perfect color for an APA, pale but respectable.  Smell of hops, some malts (maybe caramel), maybe spices. Very well balanced.  Yum. Hops on the front, but not as overpowering as I thought. I'm not sure I know any beers, especially Pale Ales, that merge hops and malts so seamlessly. Cascade hops? I'm bad at guessing varieties. A slightly sweet finish. Aftertastes of hops.  Good mouthfeel, carbonation and hops are matched well. Starts off bubbly and intimidating but finishes smooth. Crisp the whole way through. Feels good rolling around in my mouth.  Very drinkable -- an all-around great beer. I see why this is such a staple of the beer drinking world. APAs may not be my favorite, but within the style this is hard to beat.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,sopor,3.6,"Clear golden-amber with lots of quickly rising bubbles. Thick slightly rock head dissipates evenly leaving some nice lace on the glass. Smells of slight biscuity malt and citrusy hops.  BIscuit maltyness lead by just a hint of sweetness are quickly joined by an assertive but not overly powerful hops. Hops taste slightly citrus, slightly herbal. Biscuity bready flavors last for the after taste.  A refreshing brew with light body and light carbonation. Very drinkable, not outstanding for any reason, but good.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,SkeeterHawk,4.07,"Appearance: It pours a super clear golden color with a loose half inch of head at first pour that fell within about 30 seconds to a small ring maintained by a few bubbles rising. There isn't any lacing on the glass after drinking.  Aroma: Citrus hops are the first thing that you notice. It smells fresh and green. There are some floral hoppy notes coming out in the aroma as well. I can get a bit of caramel malts and a bit of a nutty malt aroma like it is derived from British pale malts.  Taste: The taste starts out with the flavor of the hops and then pretty quickly the carbonation kicks in and leads the malt into the profile. Finally at the end of the flavor, there is a bitterness that fades in to be the dominant force at the end of the profile.  Opinion: This beer is a staple of any American beer aficionados diet. It is pretty readily available, and tastes good. This makes it common at beer gatherings. The beer overall is really drinkable, even if you aren't a hophead like myself. Here in Houston, it goes great with some BBQ at the local park.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,ggroller,4.1,"I've had this beer many times before. I spotted a case bottled on 5/13/05 at my local distro and decided to make this my session beer for the next few days.  Color is straw bordering on a slighty darker, copper color. Very little white head but nice lacing.  Smells of bread, malty sweetness, and just a hint of hops. Cascade, I think, although I could be wrong.  I taste the malt and biscuity/ bready yeast first, then a punch of bitter hops. Very, very little hop aroma in the nose.  Mouthfeel is very carbonated.  Overall, a very drinkable beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,FLAbeergutinMASS,4.6,"On tap at the Land Ho in Orleans.  What a great beer. This is a perfect example of what a Pale Ale should be. It does not have all the characteristics that I truly enjoy, but its balance is so good its incredible. The perfect amount of hops, followed by a fruity, but not over powering body, finished by a slight pine ending. Tops in its class.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,ReebShorts,4.28,"Poured into a mug, with an Ayinger logo that I picked up at Central Market for $3 (handwashed). Impressive bubbly white head on pour that did not fade away completely (until about half-way through). Color is orange, only slightly cloudy.  Smell is NW hops, yeast, some citrus (orange, tangerine, something like that) was not a powerful aroma, so had to dig the nose deep to pull out the citrus. Smells good, like an easy drinker that's not too sweet.  Ok, first drink I thought, I just found an excellent new session beer. Man, this stuff is tasty. Not overwhelming by any means, but I'd much rather sit around drinking these on a lazy &lt;insert day&gt; afternoon, than bud or something along those lines. I was pleasantly surprised at the lightly creamy finish. Also just a tinge of alcohol finish, very nice, this killed the potential for any lingering effect, instead it asked ""please drink again right away, sir"". Drinkability on this is off the charts.  I can't belive this is the first time I've tried this as I've been around it in various bars many times, but i'll be sure to make up for lost time now.  Next time fishing with the old man, i'm taking some of these along. He'll appreciate it after the last outing with a halfer of Pabst.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,burnstar,4.18,Nose is malty and a bit yeasty with some nice floral hops coming through. Pours a wonderful amber with a medium white foamy head. Aroma and appearance combine to make this a most enticing libation. First sip starts with some pleasant sweet maltiness and finishes with enough lingering hop spicy bitterness to balance it out. Medium to full bodied for a pale ale and coats the mouth nicely. This is a very enjoyable beer and I'm glad it's becoming so widely available.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,SaCkErZ9,4.32,"I tend to like hoppy beers as opposed to less hoppy beers so this is a great example of what a pale ale should be. It is pale; actually a light to medium amber color. It has a perfect hop aroma and taste balance. One can definitely feel the small bite of the hop bitterness which i absolutely love. A very drinkable beer anytime of the year and on any occasion. I personally prefer drinking this beer with a bacon chesse chicken sandwich and fries while watching any kind of sporting event, preferable college football. A great beer to keep in the fridge all the time (which is what I do).",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,futaboots,4.23,"Back again with another classic.  Back when I knew not much about good beer, drinking this was like getting a slap in the face. Drinking my first IPA, that was like getting punched in the face. This beer was a gentle slap to the cheek.  Instantly, when you take the first sip of this beer, you will notice flavor. A bitter, acidic citrusy, fruit punchy flavor. It is hoppy, that's for damn sure. There is also an underlying, rich caramel note, to this beer. Finishes dry, with that lingering bitterness from the hops.  Appearance. Clear as the glass I'm drinking out of. Copper colored, with a head that refuses to die.  Mouthfeel, carbonation is a bit high, but acceptable. There is a slight bit of a syrupy feel, but overall this is pretty crisp.  One of my favorite beers of all time, it is so versatile, and pairs well with a wide variety of foods. Can be enjoyed by itself, either in a pub with a large crowd of people, or as an after work relaxant. The amount of hop bitterness turns off some people though.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,thechaacster,3.9,"Pours a slightly hazed amber with a modest head that recedes to leave a nice lacing that lasts through the glass. Mild but slightly raw hop aroma. Flavor is highly hopped, floral with citric overtones. Hop bitterness is definitely up there, but a nice doughy malt backbone keeps it all together. Super smooth mouthfeel, and easily drinkable. Being one of the very few truly well known craft beers, it commands respect from American BAs.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,charlatan,3.82,"This is a simple, but good beer. There are no frills. The appearance (amber, medium head, a little lacing) is nothing special, and the smell is rather clean and slightly herbal. Hops are the focus here, and while the initial flavour may seem one dimensional, I have rarely found a better hop flavour (again it is very clean, herbal and fresh). The carbonation is good and the finish is pleasantly creamy with a hint of raisins coming through.  This is what run of the mill pale ales should be imitating. Good stuff!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,chilidog,4.15,"I say this is a good vacation beer, for it seems to be the one I order when on vacation, otherthan a brew-pub. Its SN most Available brew in locations that offer little micro offerings. Its nice to see thisone from time to time. Its 5.6% abv is nice for its higher than most macs, so one or two with a meal...hotel...next day, your ready to go. The beer itself pours a nice orange/amber with an average, no fizz creamy head. Lace is an added touch. The aroma is bold of floral, hoppy crispness to the nose. The taste again follows the path of the aroma as a crisp, citric hop jumps first (not over the top strong). A mild sugary caramel malt balances well as the mouth is teased with a mild alcohol feel. Again, a good drinkable stand-by micro. Kinda like seeing a friendly face in a crowd of macro strangers.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,ryantupy,3.78,"Poured a bright golden orange haze with a little white head that tended to cling to the glass. Smelled of very strong hops, some floral notes, and some citric scents aswell. Tasted nice creamy and smooth with a very mild malty crispness. I found it a little on the bitter hop side but in an enjoyable way. I really enjoyed this beer and ended up buy another round of it. So i would definatly reccomend this beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Backer2004,3.93,"I haven't reviewed this one yet? Anyway, always a very good choice, though it seems to be one of the more expensive beers in North Carolina at a typical grocery store. Nice copper colored, without too much hoppiness. No bad characteristics to speak of . . . I'll still pcik the Flying Dog Pale Ale for the price alone.  I do recall now having the Sierra Nevada comped on my stay at Bally's in Vegas, which was a plus.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,ommegangpbr,3.83,"SNPA... Snuh Puhhh... In my experience, one of the most readily available brews to be found in bars outside of Bud Miller and Coors. Quite the change up from the common three. This actually has color, aroma, and quite a backbone when it comes to flavor. This one spits in the face of all that is typical macro flavor. This brew has balls. Big ones. It's not afraid to jiggle them. SNPA isn't my favorite beverage... the bitterness that lives there isn't for me. But I like knowing that it's out there. Kind of like the drunken irishman that will beat the hell out of the frat boy that gets out of line.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,SCW,3.98,"Had this one on-tap at Stout in Manhattan.  My sample poured a deep orange, almost amber color. I always admired how Sierra Nevada Pale Ale was a little deeper and richer than most pale ales.  The aroma? Usually, it's pretty impressive. I don't know if this particular keg was old, but I had virtually no hop aroma in this one.  The taste was well-balanced, very dry in accordance with style. There are a significant amount of flavor hops to round out the bitterness in the aftertaste.  The beer was medium-bodied and drinkable, and altogether, an American classic.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,cooter,3.29,"Pours a macro-like yellow. Head appears creamy and very light. Carbonation light to none. Above average but not spectacular lacing.  Mouthfeel is sticky, hoppy, somewhat sugary, but very metallic and granular near the end. I've never gotten that from this beer before, and I've had a few in my day. Somewhat rice-y in front, but smooth.  Taste includes bitterness, a hint of hops, grapefruit, and some of both green apple and melon. Pungent kick near the end of each swallow of alcohol. Rather nice but needs either mellowing or less light when stored.  This beer is all over the place today. Creamy but grainy, flavorful but plain, smooth but cloying. Maybe this is a bad one, but there's some saving grace due to it being a style that can handle adversity--it does.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,danielharper,3.4,"Purchased from Great Spirits, Huntsville, AL.  Looks good, with a nice solid amber coloration topped with a foamy snowcap of head. The head dissipates over time, leaving little lacing, but it seems to fit the characteristics of an APA pretty well.  Smell is quite distinct, so much so that I can almost use it to describe other things, ""like a SNPA"". Really pretty overwhelmed with hops, but unlike other heavily-hopped beers, it doesn't seem to be overdone or unpleasant. It's just, well, how a SNPA is supposed to smell. Pretty decent, although I find it a bit uncomplex.  Unfortunately, this beer tastes pretty much just as it smells, and while the simplicity and hoppiness of the aroma are nice, the same things in the taste seem overdone. It's nice that the beer is well-hopped and pretty balanced overall, but there are no other flavors that jump out at me at all, and the beer leaves a bitter aftertaste that I don't really find enjoyable.  Mouthfeel is moderate, with a nice foamy carbonation mixing with a watery consistency to make something reasonably unique. I goes down smooth, yet it coats the tongue quite nicely. Pretty decent.  I tend to associate this beer in my mind with Samuel Adams Boston Lager, and of the two, the SA is my favorite hands-down. I can see why this is so well-respected by BAs all over the world, and I enjoy one now and again, but this beer isn't anything really special, and I find myself satiated for it after just one.  I do find it better on-tap, though. I had one at Ted's Buffalo Grill in Nashville, and found the quality much-improved over the bottled variety. Unfortunately I've never found a place in Alabama that serves it on-tap, so I am unable to test this hypothesis in a reasonable manner.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Tim460,4.18,appearance: Golden-orange color with a small white head that quickly dissipates.  Smell: floral hops and citric as beer warmed a hint of grains appeared.  Hops very apparent at first with bitter taste. As beer began to warm a malty taste kicked in that balanced out the beer nicely. Medium body that goes down smooth. This is a very drinkable APA and one of my favorites that is readily available.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,mjohn27603,3.85,Pours yellow golden from a 24 fluid ounce bottle. Aroma is of piney hops with with some sweetness. Head develops into 1 head and then goes away within a minute or two. Sip reveals a piney hops flavor with some bitterness if held in the mouth for a while. Hops seems to dominate here. A very solid beer that you can find in many run of the mill places. Not citrusy hops flavor. Still a pale ale without running into the IPA category. Some slight sweetness too.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,palliko,4.3,"Appearance is a cloudy orange with white foam and clinging lace. Aroma is floral hops, green leaves and lemon blossoms. There are some barley and malt notes, too.

Color is an amber shade....head that retains for a few minutes. Tons of carbonation.  Smell is earthy with some charcoal and slight alcohol...  Taste is the best part of this beer, can get a bit musky, cardboard in the nose but the hops eventually kick its ass.

Pours a very slightly hazy (chill haze, yeast?) gold with orange tints. One finger off white head of creamy foam, which drops to about 1/2 finger and stays for most of the beer. Strong carbonation evident, almost appears effervescent. Lacing all the way down the glass.  Aroma is of lemons, grapefruit, and tangerines, followed by a slightly bready, pleasant pale malt smell; maybe a little yeast in there. Some caramel smell there as well. The aroma lasts for the whole beer. Impressive!  The first flavor to hit is a very smooth sweetness, quickly followed by a good dose of bitterness. Then lemons and grapefruit, fresh and tart. Really well balanced APA. Nothing huge or anything, but seems right on style. Backing up all this hop character is a perfect malt base. It's bitter and hop flavored, but the pale malt really comes through, balancing it nicely.  The mouthfeel is just so smooth it seems weird. When I poured it, the carbonation looked out of whack, but it's surprisingly soft. A little sweet, a little bitter, with a long finish in the back of your throat.  As APA's go, this has to be one of the best out there. Assertive, but not IPA-like, 5.6% ABV, a great representation of the style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,fisherman34,3.65,"Golden with a tinge of amber. Hoppy aromas of grass and mild citrus. Some grainy malt flavors combine with notes of citrus hops and white grape skin.

140,276,wingnutter,4.21,"My 1st review on BA. I recently ditched the world of macros and entered the world of crafts and micros. SNPA was one of the 1st beers I tried, and my 1st APA. The 1st 6 pack I drank was an enlightening experience.  The first taste I took I was almost floored by how much hoppiness and general flavor this beer had. A tad overwhelming at first (to a macro-head, which is what I was). By the 3rd one, I began to LOVE this beer. When the 6 was gone, I drove back to the store at mach 3 to pick up a 12 pack (and was glad and surprised SN makes a 12 pack of this. Thumbs up for that.) This beer opened my eyes to a whole new world.  Nice hoppy, piney taste, with a citrusy kick. The 1st taste is a nice kick in the taste buds, but it quickly fades into a nice dry finish that makes me want to take another sip right away. I liken the taste to ""drinking a pinecone"". I think I started my internship of ""hophead in training"" with this one. I never knew I liked hoppy beer, but apparantly, I do. As I try more APAs, I will instinctly use this one to judge others against.  Great taste, HIGH drinkability, decent ABV, widespread availability and reasonable sticker price make this one a winner on all fronts.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,carln26,4.17,"Nice copper to amber color, very clear with a thick off-white head. It had an aroma of grapefruit rind (very pronounced), and a more subtle hop flower and grass aroma backed by mild caramel on the finish. The taste has the citrus/hop up front with the hop flower coming across subtly. The caramel is very light on the finish. Very smooth, and light mouth feel, very drinkable.

Clean, hoppy taste and wonderful aroma makes this a great choice almost any time.  Appearance: Crisp, clear amber. Nice pale ale.  Smell: Certainly not hiding the hops here.  Taste: A solid example of an APA. Slight citrusy sweet taste up front, followed by a great hop bitterness on the way back.  Mouthfeel: Good. Nothing remarkable here. Light and clean.

Smells of floral hops. Quite complex. The hops are very dry and complimented well with hints of citrus.  Tastes great--just bitter enough. The hops are bittersweet and present upfront, all floral and citrusy, mellowing out in the middle and met at the end with a sweet kiss of malt.  THE session beer to end all session beers.

But since I'm well stocked on it at the moment... The citrusy hops aroma and flavor and crisp, bitter finish set the standard for west coast pale ales. The only bad thing I can say about it is that I've consumed so much of the stuff that it can get a little boring. But if I haven't had it for a while, when I finally do it's clearly a great beer, a true classic.  Most beer drinkers can probably agree that this beer's most important quality is its availability.

140,276,1whiskey,4.41,"Pours out with a 1""head thats holds up most of the way, with some foamy lacing. Appearance is a gorgeous transparant amber color with lots of bubbles and a little yeast settlement. Absolutely beautiful. The aroma is all about the citrusy hops and piney spices. Very appropriate for a brewery located at the junction of the Cascades and the Sierras...very nice. Taste is even better....mirroring the aroma but with a slightly more bitter hop taste, some floral esters....yeast is very prominant here, even for a bottle-conditioned APA. Some grainy malts are subtle here(that's what I prefer anyway), just enough to provide some balance to those wonderful hops. Mouthfeel is great, with a medium body and the perfect ammount of carbonation. Very crisp, biting finish and the best dry afteraste I've ever had in a APA or even an IPA, for that matter. This is THE preeminent West Coast pale ale, and for good reason. It's great by itself, or it pairs well with most anything. A favorite snack of mine involves paring it w/ jack, colby, and medium or sharp chedder followed by a jonagold apple when you're done with your beer. Try it, it's great!!  NOTE: If you have tried this beer and didn't like it, give it another chance already! Sierra Nevada distributes aggressively and is botttle conditioned, and some unworthy distributers and retailers(gas stations, supermarkets, etc.) sometimes store it warm for long periods of time. I've gotten a couple of brews that were quite...well....lets just say they had seen better days. So pick it up at a reputable retailer or try it on tap, I'm sure you won't be disappointed.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,mushroomcloud,3.83,"12oz bottled 3-14-2018 (2018 Party Pack) Clear amber with a 1/3"" white head on top. Decent retention as it fades to a cap. Nose seems muted, faint pine and grapefruit rind hints. So good, clean on entry, bright, fresh - great malt backbone carries the beer and balances out the Cascade bitterness. Medium body, great carbonation keeps it lively, persistent bitterness along with nice balance and drinkability. Could drink all day and have before!  5-30-2005 Sierra Nevada Pale Ale....old faithful!! Picked up a 12 pk today at an outrageously low price. Happy Memorial Day!! The Pale Ale pours out a deep honey gold color. A 1"" head formed and sank to a small white cap that rode the beer most of the way down. Light lacing left on the glass. The nose of this beer is a nice citric hop with a little pine/spruce. The flavor is dominated by a nice hop twang. A little citrusy, lemon/grapefruit. Very clean and easy to drink, the 12pk may not last long. Nice carbonation on the tongue and also a crisp mouthfeel. This is a standard among American Pale Ales and I always enjoy it. In fact I have not had a bad Sierra Nevada brew. If you haven't had it , have it. If you haven't had it in a while, go get some. Good session stuff!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,silver0rlead,3.65,"Pours a pale amber color with a small white head that dissapates quickly. Smell is floral, piney hops with a grainy malt background. Taste is very similar to the smell with a floral and resiny hops taste that gives way to a grainy, bready malt flavor and ends in a dry, slightly bitter finish. Overall a pretty standard pale ale, but nonetheless an original as it was one of the first craft beers to become widely available.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,cubedbee,4,"Sierra Nevada is a nice old familiar beer that is thankfully found at many a restaurant serving mainstream swill. Pours a lovely amber with a thick finger and a half of head and good lacing. Smells of citric and piney hops with a definite malt presence behind. Flavor is close to the nose, with grapefruit and lemons coming through and a strong malt backbone. Simple, but good. The mouthfeel is on the ligght medium side and the medium carbonation is just right on the tongue.

140,276,diablo14,4.1,"theres not alot i can say abou this beer that hasnt already been said. one of the very best all round session beers going around in the world, let alone the US. its the sort of beer youd be proud to have in your fridge as your standard beer.  theres nothing different in the appearance of this brew from the hundereds of other pale ales out there, and its not the most complex brew going around. nevertheless SN pale goes by the old english beer philosophy of less is more. simple grapefruit zest smell/taste, with a hint of cut grass and sneaky malt in the mix. pleasing hops presence, its floral on the nose, bitter on the palate, and goes down the hatch with a fine zing as it hits the spot. an absolute delight to drink anytime ,anywhere.  all i can say is its a pity you cant just head down your local in australia and pick this up whenever you like, coz its a pearler of a brew",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

A carbonic bite, then smooth smooth bready malt flavors accented by grapefruity hops, followed by a clean bitterness that has me wanting more of the stuff. This is a classic, quenching pale ale with just the right amount of bitterness. The wonderfully hoppy character of this beer come out more when just slightly chilled. The bottle I'm having now is probably just a bit too chilly, but the previous bottle was just perfect.

140,276,Symposium,4.4,"Ah, the seminal classic. I find myself drinking this one more than probably any other beer just because you can seem to find it everywhere--even the most pathetic bars and convenience shops. Though it may not live up to some other APAs I've had (Alpha King comes to mind), I find myself genuinely satisfied every time I have it.  The beer pours an inviting light amber with a sturdy head that works itself down after a few minutes. Looks like a pale ale!  The nose is colored by citrusy hops that remind you that you are holding a real West Coast beer.  And then the drink. Malt is mild and upfront, followed by a healthy dose of those lemony, grapefruity hops which eventually turn pleasantly bitter.  What is so fantastic about SNPA is the balance and cohesiveness of all of its flavors. While I love ridiculously hop-heavy IPAs, it's refreshing to have a beer that comes with a sense of decency.  For this reason I can drink this ale all night. Sure, you might get bored, but it'll never let you down as far as quality goes.  A classic of the style and one that is a much welcomed fallback when the only other choices are macros or skunky imports.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,thetros,4.83,"The Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is a jewel within a strong line-up of beers from this respected West Coast brewer.  Consistency comes to mind when I consider this beer as a top 100 contender. The smooth malt and sweet bouquet of hops has a consistent freshness that makes this a beer drinker's staple. For a beer to earn its rank, I believe it must taste good this year and next, rather than just have a fine batch or season.  Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is appropriate for all seasons as it is heavily hopped and malty enough to stand up to a hearty meal, though fresh and crisp enough to accompany your picnic or ballgame. Medium carmel color and a tamed head make this pale ale a charming pint, indeed.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,AlexJ,3.28,"This is another one of those beers we've all had a million times, but never think of reviewing. I rarely even order it anymore, I guess I had my fill of it in college.  It pours out a clear, pale amber color with a medium sized head of off white that had medium retention and laces nicely.  The aroma is kind of sweet and doughy, not really as I remember it. There's a slight undertone of floral and piney hops. I think perhaps this is an old keg, or from unclean tap lines.  The flavor is very similar to the nose. Bready malts and rather bland, unpronounced hop flavors. I know that this beer is better than this, it must be an old keg.  The body is light to medium with moderate carbonation and a muted floral hop finish.  I remember there was a time when the sight of the green SNPA tap handle at a pub was enough to excite me, I guess those days are long past. I'll choose to remember this beer from past experiences, which were always good. This is one of the beers that has lead us ALL down the path of beer rightiousness.

Hop aroma is strong with a faint smell of fresh lettuce? Taste is of that typical Sierra Nevada malted barley, a strong hop flavor for an APA and orange rind which I don't remember from the past. Taste is good with a little bit of bitterness at the end. Mouthfeel is smooth and easily drinkable. A true classic APA in my opinion.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,beersarang,4,"Probably the most solid example of the American Pale Ale.  This APA pours a nice copper with a froth white head that holds its sticky lace well.  Nose is of citrusy hops. Cascade all over the place.  Lightly toasted malts enter the palate, but the citrusy hops coat the palate, and leave on the exhale. Goes down pretty smooth and mildly astringent.  Medium bodied, pretty drinkable.  A very respectable APA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

The flavor has smooth malt at the start followed by an excellent balance of hops towards the end. The hops come across better with more sips. Gotta love the balance, nothing is overstated. The mouthfeel is light-medium bodied, very carbonated and it has a refreshing effect. I wonder about the drinkability.. while it would be great to have one or two, and they would be a very drinkable one or two.. having much more than that would be over doing it for me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,Skidz,4,"Some times, you just have to go back to the basics...  Pours out bright golden orange and sits amber-tinted gold in the glass, moving from the lightest golds to the deepest ruby-amber in the tulip. Good sized white head, fades to a thin skim, leaving lacings around the glass.  Smells of fresh citrus, oranges, lime and bits of fresh ruby red grapefruit. The slightest hint of pine hangs around. Caramel blends in, and holds some fruity esters, mainly apples, bright and vibrant. All lightly toasted.  Citrus comes out immediately in the mouth, big notes of grapefruit and orange, displaying a tangy pine resin inbetween. Malts seem cleaned out and sterile, providing light sweetness, with faint reaches of carmel sitting on a near crackery core. Finish is nicely bittered, still holding on to grapefruit oils and bits of pine.  Crisp and lively in the mouth, it fails to dissapoint. Medium-light in body overall with vibrant carbonation.  It's just that easy to drink. Simple, yet elegant.

140,276,Chadbrew,4.3,"I would be OK I think if I could only drink from one brewery and that brewery was Sierra Nevada. Pours out a honey colored slightly hazy beer with mild carbonation and little to no head. Definitely some hops in this beer, you can smell them first and then some sweet malt. The taste is a quick bitter-sweet that lends way to a nice malty flavor. Then there is a wash of floral hop aroma followed by a bitter-dry finish and a lingering citrus taste. Mouthfeel is very good for this style. I expected a thinner beer but this has decent body. A very drinkable beer.

Dissipated to a thin covering left good lacing down the glass. Clear with some carbonation evident.  Smell: Hoppy, mostly citrus fruit with some floral notes. There is also a hint of sweet caramel malt, but I notice mostly the hops.  Taste: Outstanding. Hoppy on the outset, balanced by a firm maltflavor in the middle. It finishes hoppy. What I want in an APA, very well balance and not too strong in any diredtion (although it maybe leans a little towards the hoppy side which for me is good for the style).  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, lightly carbonated. Smooth and well balanced beer.  Drinkability: I believe this is the first 5 I have ever given. Just a perfect beer to drink. I was wrong in a previous review. This is the APA by which to judge all other APA's. Helping this beer out is that it is available practically all over (I have seen it in gas stations) .

Hops are strong and prevalant, but don't totally overpower the tastebuds.

Pours a amber orange with a nice head that dissipates quickly. Still, a great looking pale ale.  The smell hooks you in. The cascade hops smell citrusy and fruity and inviting. Beneath those is a sweet malty flavor that balances it out, resulting in what I consider the ""real beer smell.""  Great taste. Sweet, fruity, citrus hop flavor. This is backed up my a warm malt flavor that isn't truly balancing but just enough where the hops don't overwhelm. Still, not bitter and very smooth.

140,276,troutmask96,3.59,"A decent pale ale, nothing too special here. Pours a dark golden translucence with a large head. Very hoppy smelling, with notes of pine and citrus.

Was there an APA before Sierra Nevada Pale Ale? Was there Sierra Nevada before there was an APA? The answer is yes, of course, but I wouldn't know because I'm 24 years old.   So what up-makes this APA? The answer seems obvious; all them west coast hops. That's the flavor, primarily, and the malt could only get in the way if it were to present itself any more strongly.

Smells like a light/moderate toasted caramel malt with grass/resin grapefruit/orange hops and hints of honey.  Taste has a light sweet acidic toasted caramel malt with the same hoppy taste as the smell and the background may have a slight licorice and cola flavor.  Has a medium body, dry slightly syrupy texture, soft and lively carbonation, and a slight metallic finish.

The smell was a very nice, floral hops aroma with some maltiness poking through the hops. The taste was malty but with a very large dose of flowery, floral hops and bitter hops especially in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth and very pleasing to the palate. The body was medium with moderate carbonation feel. The fruity and floral hops lingered in the finish. This is a very, very nice pale ale, and one can see why it is considered a classic in the American Pale Ale style. I can't believe it took me this long to get around to reviewing it.

Has that west coast floral/piney hop aroma with some malt and grains underneath.  Also tastes like what one would expect a west side PA to taste. Dry and very hoppy with just enough malt to bring balance. The moderate carbonation is in line with a medium mouthfeel. Long dry finish that lingers but doesn't wear out its welcome.  A very drinkable brew that ,IMHO, sets the bar for west coast PAs.

I enjoyed this beer at lunch at Hiway Pizza in State College, PA on tap on a wonderfully spring-like day in February. There are noticeable differences between the bottle and draught, and I think I like it on tap better, but its also one of the best quality bottled APAs out there. This is the APA to which I compare all others, due to its sentimental value to me and its widespread availability, and theres only a select few I would take over Sierra Nevada (like Red Seal Ale).  This ale is a light amber color with a white, dense, mostly diminishing head with little lacing early. The aroma is more malty than I remembered, but still very nice. Its also a bit piney and citrusy. The taste is marvelous! A wonderful balance of bready maltiness and bittering hops. The hops are noticeable right off the bat but still rather mellow, but the bitterness picks up a bit toward the finish. And theres a slightly grapey taste in there. The finish is crisp, medium in length, but just so damned easy-drinking! I think its sweeter on tap than from bottle. One of the most refreshing beers out there.

Read a lot of other reviews, kinda surprised by my appraisal of it: Perfect amber orange pour, head and lacing somewhat poor (old beer?).

140,276,Dithyramb,4.77,"One of my old standbys from way back when. SNPA is quite possibly one of the first micro-brews that started this long, strange trip for me. Had two bottles last night while at a very non-beer-knerd establishment. Presentation: 12oz short brown twist cap bottle and the traditional green label that doesnt appear to have changed much over the years.  Appearance: Decidedly orange, with a golden hint and a bit of chill haze. Doesnt develop a long lasting head, but the white lace lays on top and clings all over the glass.  Smell: Raw hop leaves, grains, and a bit of something floral.  Taste: Extremely well balanced, yet tipped slightly into the hop bitterness category. The hops are stinging when you first drink the brew, almost as if the beer is too cold and it is chilling your tongue. There is a very smooth, creamy, and bread laden malt undertone that holds up well. The hops tip the balance scale on the back end of the flavor profile. Citric floral hops finish, giving a slightly acidic and dry feeling. Very well crafted and worth a few.

This is a stunning APA out of the bottle, but out of the tap it's frickin' exceptional. It pours to a clear amber color with a medium frothy white head that stays for most of the pint. The smell seemed somewhat subdued, though I have somewhat of a nasal cold. This didn't kill my judgement, however, as I could still smell the wonderfull citrusy/hop smell. Also, the retro-olfaction was actually improved somewhat, as the odors seemed to get caught up in all the mucuous from the cold. I will definately be revisiting this from the tap wherever available, particularly if there is nothing new to try (though the bar I had this at, the Sanctuary, still has quite an enourmous selection of beers that I haven't tried.)

Some floral/citrus notes (lemon?) and grains with the malts getting more pronounced as it warms, along with a bit of yeast. The carbonation is crisp at first but becomes smooth. Easy to drink.

Smell was faint at best, consisting primarily of hops and pine.  Taste was almost non-existant. Not hoppy enough with a sweet cloying finish.  Ugghhh. Sierra Nevada makes some damn fine beers (Bigfoot is still my all time favorite beer), but I'll pass on this one from now on.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,SkullFission,3.73,"This pours pale (as expected), with a thin head if you're light on the pour. The taste is a bit over-citrusy for my tastes, and I much prefer the SN porter and stout to this, but it still holds its own. The smell is rather nondescript, although it hints to the taste. This is a better compliment to lighter foods than the porter or stout are, and it's the only SN available at the Albertson's which is close to me (the closest liquor store is 45 minutes away, but I still catch it on the way back from university), so I keep coming back to it. A sometimes thin, sometimes thick (depending on age I suspect) layer of sediment dwells on the bottom due to bottle conditioning, which encourages a light pour. Enjoyable, but certainly not the best SN offering.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Smells hoppy and herbal. Tastes really hoppy for a pale ale--also has a woody taste. Pretty carbonated. You know what SNPA tastes like. A balanced mouthfeel.  Ahh, the classic pale ale. The taste of this brings back good memories. This beer goes so well with any meal, especially pizza. Mmm. Anything by Sierra Nevada is always welcome in my pint glass.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Luigi,4.3,"I must say this is one of my favorite beers. Has a very hazy orange color to it. You can see the particals of yeast from the bottle conditioning. The head is fairly large and settles to a sticky lace around the glass. Smells hoppy with a little grain. Bitter spice, citrus,malts, and pine dominate the flavor. A very drinkable pale ale! I think it is the perfect session beer! In my opinion, Sierra Nevada Pale ale is truely a classic American beer!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Zraly,4,"Pours a medium-golden color with a two finger head, precisely what should be in order. Nice herbal hop scent. And a curious accumulation of small yeast mounds at the bottom of my glass. I'm not sure if this is typical or not, but...an interesting sight for an APA.  The malt flavors are dominated by notes of raw grain and bready malts. A slight hint of sugar is layered amongst the very generous hop flavor. Smooth drinking with citrusy, herbal and slightly woodsy hop character. It's rather easy to drink more than one.  Sierra Nevada's flagship...and a good one at that. This should be the standard by which other APA's are judged. This is the lay of the land. Someone order the pizza.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Illini5596,4.28,"Nice golden brew which while it has a dissapointing head, the lacing is quite nice. The smell is strong and carries through the classic ale aromas, hops dominating them all. On tasting the first impression is sharply that of the hops, which slowly blends to a vanilla creamy sweetness with a very even mouth feel. The after taste is a twang of sharp hops tempered by smooth cream. All over a very drinkable ale. The level of hops may put off some people but it is very well rounded and masterfully crafted. A good beer drinkers beer, great for sharing with your friends, and a good introduction to master crafted ales.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,KroMagnon,4.49,"Clear, color is a light reddish-golden (on tap it seems darker to me though). The head is white and dissipates a bit rapidly. The aroma is clean with a bit of maltiness and a nice citrusy hop smell. The flavor is crisp, clean, with a slightly sweet malty base followed by a piney, resinous hop note and a solid bitterness. Several years ago this was the hoppiest beer I had regularly; since then its hoppiness has been surpassed by others, but I don't think any beer is as well balanced and compliemented as this one. This is a great beer and delicious.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,BruceBeerman,4.62,"Ah, the sweet nector of a west coast pale ale. The cascade hops with their citrus/floral aroma, the nice bitterness, and the wonderful mouthfeel of this beer it very nice. One of the best of its style.  It is nice golden color with 2 finger head. The foam disapate slowly and nice lacy foam clings to the glass as you drink it. It is bottle conditioned, so don't pour the sentement at the bottom of the bottle (dead yeast). It won't hurt, but just a little too bitter and off flavor as the rest is intended.  I love the history of this bewery and how they were pioneers in developing and marketing the APA style. One of the first and few true west coast micros to be sold in Pennsylvania.  Half of my homebrews are APA style because I liked it so much. SN APA is one of the reasons why. I love the floral cascade hops (and plenty of them).",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

(swirling...swirling...) Thin and whispy white head that kicks up retreats quickly to a ring around the glass.  The aroma is all cascade - oranges and Flowers, a bit of sugar behind. A good aroma but somehow a bit boring.  Flavor is on style - rich malt up front with soft herbal hop flavors moving accross the tongue. Body is pretty light, hop bittering is there at the end but subdued and mildy dry. Nothing terribly complex, just good, light bodied balance.  Tasty and quaffable, Classic, if not The Origional, American Pale Ale. I seem to remember liking this more 5+ years ago tho...have I changed...? ....or the beer? Possibly both.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

There are heavy traces of citrus in there and a flowery character to wrap up the sweetness, like the nectar of this beer :)  Taste is.. great. Its tihck and bready with a caramel like sweetness thats balanced with the bitterness. Butter and flowers flow throughout the sips. Bitter and sweet blend perfectly and then comes the somewhat prickly alcohol and a large bitterness in the aftetaste together with spicy traces.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Crotor,4.43,"Pours crystal clear light amber with two fingers of off-white head that lingers, laces, and threatend to dimple. An ideal appearance for an APA.  Smells of bready malt and slight, citrus hops. No esters. Nice and *clean.*  Tastes crisp, with prominent, bready malt. Expertly balanced with the grapefruit rind hop flavor of Cascade hops. No yeast esters thanks to the 1056... Just clean, bready malt and citric hops in perfect balance. A simple and impressive profile.  The mouthfeel is fairly light, and slightly creamy. Entirely pleasant.  The drinkability is top-notch. This'd be a hard beer to grow tired of. Leaves me wanting more. Compliments a wide range of food, and does little damage to the palate. A hell of a session beer.  Goddamn. I'm damned impressed with SNPA this time around. For about the past two years I've only had it as my ""fallback beer"" when at restaurants, and it's usually been served way too cold, usually in one of those frosted tulip-pilsner glasses. Drinking it now, at the proper temperature (so that I can actually *taste* it) it's way more nuanced than I'd thought. When ice cold, all that I was able to taste were prominent, citrus hops. Now that it's warmed up, I can taste the depth of bready malt, and the hops seem to be in perfect, complimenting balance. This beer must've blow people's minds when it hit the market back in the 80s...",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Smell: Smells mainly of fresh, pungent hops with a decent malt presence. ver west coast smelling.  Taste and Mouthfeel: Tastes smooth and crisp with an almost pilsener-type hop taste. The malts are decent and balance it out well. It smooth and clean in the mouth, but a little too light-bodied for my tastes.

The taste was smooth and crisp, leaving a slight aftertaste that disappeared quickly. After the initial hop hit on the tongue, subsequent sips proved pretty refreshing. It felt somewhat bitter on my tongue, but the bitterness contributed to the compexity of the flavors I was tasting. I don't know if I would drink many of these in succession, but this was a good dinner beer. I had it with somewhat spicy food, and it went pretty well. It would be interesting to try it with salads, or other types of entrees.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Powerful grapefruit hop flavors with somewhat rough grain underpinnings. Very drinkable medium-light body.  Very fresh tasting, but with a disappointingly one-dimensional flavor profile. Lots of tasty grapefruit hop flavor, but no malts or additional complexity in sight.

The aroma was not really distinct so I give it an average.  However, the taste is very full which I like personally; it has notes of hops, a little malt, a little fruity and a little sweet; a real nice blend. The M&D life this beer to a new dimension. I have never been more impressed by a mainstream beer than this. It is extremely smooth all over and this is an ideal session beer, watch out @ 5.6%...

There's a bit of hop aroma, along with some malt smells and some weird things I can't identify.  The taste is good and well-balanced between sweet and bitter. Not being an IPA, it isn't bitter.  The body is good, too. Not too heavy but far from light.  This is the gold standard for American Pale Ales and a very drinkable beer.

The thin cap stays the entire time, though..leaving a soft lacing on the side of the glass.  Smell: Definite citrousy hop aroma, which makes it difficult to smell much else. There are some fruity, and even woody undertones.. can pick up some sweet malts as well.  Taste: mmm, very well-balanced and smooth. Would be a superb session beer...for some reason I enjoyed this on tap much more than the large bomber I originally sampled this from. Sort of a lemony-hoppiness to the brew..with some very pleasant smooth malts for a nice, well-rounded taste. Finish is bitter and hoppy, as expected.  Mouthfeel: As creamy & smooth as I've ever seen from a pale ale. Moderate overall mouthfeel but slides down dangerously easy..  Drinkability: Fairly cheap and widely available. A staple of the APA style and one of my favorite beers to have on-tap in the area, since most of them have it.

The smell is very nice with a dominating sourish note. But there are also some fragrances like coffee, diacetyl, white bread and aroma hops.  The carbonation is quite strong, but not sharp.  The taste starts off with a mild malty taste, but that is soon replaced with a growing, fruity bitterness. The body is liberal with notes of bread, herbs and diacetyl. The finish and aftertaste is a mixture of mild hops (cascade?) and a sweet-sour note that reminds me of lemon curd.  A nice micro pale ale from a not-so-micro American brewer. On the whole, one may call this a nice beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,bigchris1313,3.98,"Appearance: Golden yellow, with a white head.  Smell: Hops. And a smidgen of malt. But most importantly, hops, which for me is the selling point because I love hops.  Taste: What can I say, other than it is the epitome of the Pale Ale. More hops than a pilsner, with a tidbit more malt. Almost grassy.  Mouthfeel: Like a macro with more body and somehow ""more solid"" carbonation.  Drinkability: It gets a 4.5 because it's a solid beer that isn't very powerful.  Notes: What can I say about this beer? It's the beer that brought me into the realm of Beer Advocacy. This is the gateway drug of good beer. Furthermore, it's an incredible fall-back beer. If you're at a a moderate to nice bar in California, chances are they have this beer in bottles, so even if they fail to have anything incredible, you can usually get this beer.

Smell- Scent of hefty malt with a equally hefty amount of hops. Definite woody and floral scents.  Taste- Pretty much the perfect combo of malt and hops. A nice citrus tang to it. Maybe some apricot in there that goes well with a hoppy malt flavor.  Mouthfeel- Goes down nicely. Great level of carbonation. Slides down the throat with ease.  Drinkability- For some reason I get worn out on this beer when I drink it too often. For me it's maybe a 12 pack a year. A great pale ale, but one to be consumed only on occasion for me.

140,276,longarm,3.41,"An old stand-by, if there's a beer that hooked me on the APA style, it was this one many years ago. Certainly as in most things related to first loves, perceptions can be inflated due in part to relative experience and naivete. It should be interesting to see how this classic holds-up to closer inspection.  Appearance is light amber, showing light hints of caramel malt. The head is decent with moderate fluffiness that fades faster than I would like. Overall carbonation, however, holds quite well.  The aroma is unimpressive for the style. Somewhat dominated by alcohol odors, but mild doses of caramel malt wisp around too. Surprisingly, the aroma hops are extremely mild and less than I expected from memory.  Flavor has mild hop bitterness with tinges of pine. Malt helps to round-out the flavors, but a slight sourness on the finish detracts from the overall flavor profile. Bitterness masks this a little, but the off-flavor is certainly present.  The mouthfeel is slightly above average.  While it doesn't live up to expectations, this beer will always hold a special place with me and warrant the occasional purchase. It's decently balanced and a good transition to the wonderful world of American Pale Ales. Although I don't live there now, when I first started drinking this beer, I lived in Northern California.

A light bitterness at mid-sip that leads to a hop filled floral aftertaste. The standard of American Pales in terms of flavor.  Light bodied; crisp, clean, refreshing, and unobtrusive on the palate.

At first it seems a bit hoppy, then sweetens up, but leaves just as it came with a nice crisp, refreshing finish and no tartness.  Mouth is good, nice carbonation and it goes down smooth, had this on tap as well and it seems a bit thicker.  Drinkability is nice, but I've never gone totally nuts for it, quenches thirst very well and takes the edge off if I need a good hop fix though.

Subdued flowery hops greet the nose, while the mouth is met by a very pricky medium-bodied sensation. Smooth malt contends with distinctive flowery hoppiness right from the start, with the hops winning out in the end. There's a very nice bite in the finish, followed by a good lingering bitterness.

This is the One -- the beer that hopheads should revere for starting the richly hopped, highly complex pale and india pale ale craze. It is also perhaps a beer microbrew lovers in general should hold in high regard for sparking the renaissance that is currently in progress. I was a macro swill drinker in my early college years, and I remember my friends and I being shocked -- SHOCKED! -- that a beer still had yeast sediment in the bottom. What a revelation! Come to think of it, we said, how is it that all these other beers are brewed with yeast, but have no yeast left in the bottle? And so it began...  This is the simplest and best expression of the beauty that is Cascade hops. It is at once mouth-puckeringly hoppy and smoothly refreshing. This orange, pine, grapefruit, and flower-laden beauty dances over the tongue as gracefully and effortlessly as a butterfly flutters about a field of wildflowers, and is just sweet enough to make you think you can capture her -- but alas, she remains elusive.

Actually it seems to serve sometimes as a crossover beer; it's widely available, a lot of people know about it, but yet it's very good, unlike a lot of popular brews. Appears a vibrant orangy amber color with a typical head and lacing for a pale ale. Fruity hops abound in the nose. Taste is of course hoppy, which is good.

This is a true classic, an all around good brew, and one that got me into craft beer (although I didn't think much about it then). You can't go wrong with this one.

The color is a nice amber, with a medium, off-white head that stays for awhile and leaves good lacing down the glass. Light hop smell, bitter, yet offset well by the malts, a smooth citrusy taste that's well balanced and refreshing. Yeah, it doesn't pack a lot of punch, but it's not supposed to. You could certainly argue that ""it's not as good as it used to be"" but it's still a really good, really drinkable beer, especially since you can find one just about anywhere these days - considering that the 'default tap' at many bars is Budweiser or Coors, thank God.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Pours out to a clear light caramel, forming a creamy off-white head with veyr good retention and sticky sheets of clumpy lacing. Bubbles rise slowly through the beer with mild-moderate carbonation. Aroma is very bready and yeasty nearly overpowering the citric hops, with lots of bready alcohols and sharp cheesiness. Much different than I remember. Hops are slightly oxidized. Mouthfeel is middle of the road with a crisp finish and medium body. Taste begins with crisp carbonation, followed by rather non-descript hops, potent yeast, bready alcohols, malts which are barely perceptable in contrast to the hops and yeast. Mild to moderate bitterness. Crisp finish.  Much different than I remember, and different than what I had on-tap at Sierra Nevada Brewery. This is the 3rd bottle that has tasted this way. I'll chalk it up to a more refined palate, but this just doesn't do much for me anymore. Considered a ""classic"" American Pale Ale in many circles. Way to bready and cheesy. I would pick nearly any pale ale over this. Boston Ale is a MUCH better mass-produced alternative. If you have to drink this, drink it ice-cold.

140,276,Rootdog316,3.5,"This was a great pale ale as far as I'm concerned. I had it straight off the tap in a pint glass. Had a little bit of an amberish color to it. Although I thought it was a great beer, it tastes very similar to the Rock Bottom Brewery's Potomac Pale Ale (my last review). Sierra Nevada however is definitely in my top five of favorite pale ales.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,oxmasterscream,3.88,"Poured a light amber, clear color with a continuous stream of bubbles, seemingly feeding a tiny, creamy, white head. Nose is citrus and cascase with a sour, grainy thing happening. Taste is citrus up front, tangy and slightly fruity in the middle, bitter and dry for the finish... very balanced. Mouthfeel is very carbonated and medium to light. Great stuff from a big producer. The classic American Pale Ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,BrewMaster,3.95,"This beer was served from the tap with a dull amber color and a thin 1cm head. The aroma is a nice malty one with a bit of floral hop scent mixed in. Being that I've had this beer so much here in CA I've never really stopped to notice the beautiful aroma of this beer. But this time I did and I appreciate it much more now.  The flavor has a mild sweet malt profile with touches of cascade hops. A soft nuttiness is also present, but not in an overpowering or oily fashion. The beer is smooth and certainly suitable as a daily drinker.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,DrunkMcDermott,3.56,"Served at InField's, Chicago Loop. Good to see this style-setting beer at more places in my neck of the woods. Pours an appealing amber body under a thin pale ale head. Originally had a mild taste, but I felt that I was ""tasting"" the glass more (maybe it wasn't rinsed correctly), but the fine balance of hop and malt came through. Definite northwestern hop profile with spice, bitterness and a light fruity touch. A good, toasty malt blend that's just a little sticky on the palate. Leaves a nice aftertaste and a little alcohol warmth to enjoy afterward. Not ""extreme"" by any means, but an excellent session beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,cptnjck101,3.7,"Well I finally got around to this American classic. It wasn't bad, it wasn't great, above par in every category, but I couldn't drink more than a few of these. Can't really say anything about this that hasn't been said before, good for the style, but nothing to write home about. A must try for any connoisseur of the cold ones.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,claytri,3.5,"Well after I finished my Newcastle Brown I finally got the Sierra Pale that I had ordered. Maybe the knockout I got from the Newcastle caused my Sierra impressions to suffer, but this was purely slightly above average across the board.  It poured clear gold with a white head. It smelled of hops and malt. It's taste was clean and sharp with a malt start and a hop finish. It was light and dry in the mouth. A decent beer, but not one I'll be searching for.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,fdrich29,4.4,"Short brown bottle from Dick's Last Resort after I was allowed to leave work early because business was so slow (which I directly attribute to their lack of Dogfish Head and Stone products).  Hops and lemons fill my nose and the taste is hops galore, although not to the point that it's intrusive. Definitely a good starting brew for folks who are getting into the hops.  This is a standard nowadays, a true American beer and style to boot. This baby is dangerously drinkable, make sure you pick up enough to satisfy your thirst.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,orbitalr0x,4.6,"What can I say that hasn't already been said?? This is the best APA around and quite honestly my favorite domestic beer. Pours out of the bottle with a small head that doesn't stick around long. Smells of those wonderful Cascade hops...how I love them. The taste is smooth and hoppy. Great on a hot summer day, or any day for that matter. This is what beer should be.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,kmpitz2,4.22,"One of the first non-macro American beers I ever had back years ago. Its been over a year since I last had this one, so lets see where this takes us. The beer pours a light golden color with about one finger of head that falls quickly. The nose is hops and more hops. Just what I want in a good APA. Theres some floral and some citrus in the hop character...it just comes together and smells good. I guess I have come along since I last sampled this beer. The hop character is nicely balanced with sweet malts. Just a good beer. I would like to see a bit more hop carry through in the flavor, but it doesn't detract from the beer. The beer is not too thick or too thin in my mouth. Nice all around. This is an easy session beer. I'm glad I revisited it after taking some time off from it. Just a good offering.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,CAMRAhardliner,4.74,"This beer seems ubiquitous in America and the rest of the free world but believe it or not, its hard to come by in Ontario, Canada (thanks to our silly language laws with regards to product labels). I was expecting a lot and was pleasantly surprised. All I can say is wow!  Pours a light bronze color with a small wispy head and minimal lacing. The aroma is amazing. A flawless boquet of aroma and bittering hops with a solid bready malt background. Lots of cedary and citrusy hops without being too harsh. The taste is very hoppy but a bit more restrained than Liberty Ale. Along with hop and malt flavors there's fruits like melon and grapes evident. Incredibly Complex and well rounded with hops clearly up front.  The mouthfeel is exceptional with subtle carbonation (thanks to the bottle conditioning I suppose). This beer is excessively drinkable and as good as I imagined. Thank god they sell it in western Canada.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,FormatKid,4.3,"This one came served to me from the bar in...a Mason jar? Yep, ah well, it's a treat to find some halfway decent draught offerings in my little town.Filled to the brim of a 16oz Mason jar so not much head to speak of, although there is a sturdy layer of foam on top of the ruby-hued amber body.The scent was a bit of caramel malt, with a hefty dollop of Cascade hops, piney and grapefruit. The taste was really nice, seemed to be really fresh, resinous hops with enough malt presence to back it adequately. Mouthfeel was about medium-light, and makes the beer really refreshing. This beer had more hop presence than a local IPA I was having afterwards, so I ended up returning to it. When I had it this time it just really seemed to be pushing Pale Ale into IPA territory. Delicious, and as ever a real go-to beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,stevef,4.06,Serving style bottle at about 40 degrees from the refrigerator. Pours a nice slightly off white head. Pretty amber color. Very slight smell of malt and a light hop aroma. The taste is spicy and slightly peppery with a very pleasant hop bitterness at the finish. The malt is hardly noticeable at the beginning but as it begins to warm it becomes more apparent and a slight sweetness is detectable. The spiciness and peppery taste grows slightly as it warms too and I detect a very faint hint of clove toward the end. This is the beer that got me started on my quest for better beer and still one of my favorites. It's only fitting that it would be my first one to review.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,EvilFlyingCow,3.65,"I just bought a sixer of this. Poured a yellow-orange color with a thick light-tan head with alot of rising bubbles. Malts and hops with some lemon are very noticable in the smell. The taste is malty at first, with strong hops at the finish. The mouthfeel is strong and malty, coating the tongue with its hoppy aftertaste. I will definately buy this beer again when I am in the mood for a nice pale ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,benmiliron,3.82,"Paid $1.29 for a single bottle.  This is the classic pale ale. The quaffer/session beer for the rest of us. Good price, good brew, I'd keep this around if you're looking to get a bit tipsy for less than $7.00.  Other than that, it's really nothing special. Nice hops, but not fantastic. Not something to go for if you're looking for the unique brew. It's good, but nothing spectacular.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,crookedhalo,3.9,"Pours a golden amber colored with a thin off-white head. Cascade hop aroma and some muted caramelly malt notes, too. Not particularly bad in any sense, but nothing to email home about, either. I feel this brew shines in its drinkability. It's been a while since I had this beer, and maybe I'm being a little sentimental, but it's good. It's good so revisit some old stand-bys every now and then. Good carbonation. Lacking a bit in malt complexity, and thin in the middle, but Cascades are good...",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,ppoitras,3.95,"Enjoyed on tap at The Pub, Amherst, MA.  16oz pint glass presentation. Hardly a head, but what was present was a white film over a dark amber brew, with no lacing. Light pale malt aroma coupled with a bit of hops, with the flavor carrying on where the nose left off, and an overall acceptable feel. Mouthfeel and drinkability excellent.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,jvajda,3.73,"Appearance: Good orange-hoppy look. Smell: Mostly hops on the nose. Taste: A tasteful amount of hops and bitterness make this a well-balanced ale, from the perspective of a hop head. Mouthfeel: High carbonation and bitterness make this beer very active in the mouth. Drinkability: Well-balanced means easy to drink frequently.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Ahhdball,4.02,"Slightly hazed orange with a off white to beige head capping off the top.Malt, crisp citrus and hops bleed aroma into the nose with refreshing ease.Malt hits the tastebuds first but are doomed to a quick end by the tidal of hops. Caramel soon joins and smooths out the rest of the drink. Very nicely balanced. The entire drink shalaqs the mouth with great malt and hops. I'll have this again.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Beaver13,2.91,"The SN Pale Ale pours a bubbly golden orange with a decent white head that has good retention and laces the glass.  Its aroma is malty biscuit with some metallic hops.  The taste is biscuity malts up front with some faint floral hops and then a fairly harsh bitter aftertaste. It is medium bodied with a sticky finish.  Overall, I'm not too impressed. I was expecting more fruity notes to balance the bitterness. I can respect what this beer has done for the microbrewery business, but I've never been able to get into it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,niknar,3.88,"Pours out a amber/copper color with a pretty decent off-white head. Strong lacing down the side of the glass, and much better than average head retention put this beer among the top. Smell is a category I always struggle with. Having said that, I do detect some hops and citrus notes... possibly some malt in there as well. Overall a pleasant smell. Taste is well above average. Strong hop bitterness balanced by a sweet maltiness and some citrus flavors. Though not overly complex, I feel this is still a very delicate balance that makes it a very good beer. True to the style, it finishes with strong hop bitterness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is excellent as well. Light and crisp without being over carbonated or too thin. I consider this a very strong offering worthy of a special occasion or everyday consumption alike. Definitely a beer that any craft beer lover should try. Maybe a good beer for someone who was recently converted from macros, but I wouldn't make this one part of such a program too early due to the bitterness!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,nortmand,4.4,"Sierra Nevada is known to many as a standby and a gateway to great beer. This alone gives it high marks. Pours amber with a finger of white head. Smell of citrus and raisin. Raisin-like initial flavor, with a bitter, back of the tongue finish. Nicely carbonated, with a slightly astringent ""stickiness"" mid-tongue. Very drinkable, nice balanced, hoppy Pale Ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Gusler,4.44,"It's with a certain amount of shame that I must admit, that I rarely drink my favorite beers like SNPA, as I'm to busy with all the new beers, or some over the top beer that has caught my fancy, its a shame when we forget our ""Old Friends"", whether it be beer or people, something I plan on rectifying in both cases.  The beer disembogues the stubby brown 12-ounce bottle a slightly hazy amber color, the head portly and off white in color with the left over lace a fine velum like sheet, that obscures the glass. Oh what a wonderful nose, malt, citrus crisp, hop floral, and just plain sniffable, with the start rich in malt and somewhat sweet, top is middling in its feel. Finish has a determined acidity, the hops wonderfully spicy and the aftertaste desert bone dry. Sorry ""Old Friend"" if I have ignored you lately, it was not intentional.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Enygma,4.17,"Appearance: The bottle pours a nice amber color, with a nice frothy head that dissipates slowly into the beer as you drink it.  Smell: Strong citrusy hops with definite floral notes, the cascades come through quite strong and beautifully. the malt comes through very slightly, but is largely overpowered by the hops.  Taste: Slightly sweet malt tickles your taste buds and is quickly overpowered by the cascade hops, leaving a bitter and spicy finish to excellently balance the beer. The mouthfeel is medium and supplemented by a medium to strong carbonation.  Overall: Definitely solid beer. This one has long been one of my mainstay beers, I can find it almost anywhere I go, and pretty cheaply at that. Furthermore it's a great session brew, I can and have had many of these throughout the night, and I often feel like i just can't get enough of it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,bigbeerdrinka,4.35,"This was truly the brew that got me started on good craft beer, and to this day its still a favorite. Pours a beautiful amber with a nice white head about an inch thick. Aromas are of citrus and bitter hops, with a bit of doughy bread malt. For flavor this beer has it all. Initially this beer shows off a barrage of hops, some citrusy, some piney, a just a little that provide some nice bitterness. Somewhere in between all of it some bread and dough like malts sneak their way in to provide a perfect balance. But just as the malts appear, the hops come back into the picture to finish this beer in perfect pale ale fashion, leaving just a bit of spiciness to make you crave another sip. The body of this beer is nice and light with a crisp carbonation. Very well balanced.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,davewrona,4.5,"I really enjoyed this one! One of the best I have ever had. Tried several other Sierra Nevada products this day and this by far the best one!

Highly recommended!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,alexAK,4.33,"Pours a deep, but clear and consistent golden brown. Aroma is pleasant with slight flowery undertones.

140,276,TongoRad,4.5,"After a break I have been drinking this beer quite a bit lately and must say that I am impressed with it all over again. It's a classic in the light caramel/ citrusy hops vein but what I am struck with is just how elegant this beer has become. Residual sweetness, bitterness, malt and hops in the nose- it's all in perfect proportion. This is a real quality APA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Rio,4.2,"Poured clear and golden, without much of a head, just a ring around the edge left now. Tiny bit of a hoppy smell to it. The taste is a wonderfully smooth malt and hops flavor to it. Very nice, smooth feel to it. Previously, I've liked the sharper, crisper feel, but the smoothness of this one is wonderful.  This is a definite beer to pick up again. Wonderful Pale Ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,connecticutpoet,4.42,"This was an excellent ale that poured a clear deep yellow with a good head that dissolved to lace rings.  The aroma was beautiful, of tangy bitter hops and pine and cedar notes. It drew me toward the first taste.  The taste was very bitter, with pine and grapefruit overtones. There was no prominent maltiness. It was very dry and excellent.  I highly recommend this one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,misterscooter,4.15,"This is a beer that grew on me slowly and is now a regular in my arsenal. My first impressions, several years ago, was that it wasn't worth drinking because of the lingering aftertaste. Either I have grown used to it or their recipe has changed slightly. There are some other Sierra Nevada beers I don't like for similar reasons but the Pale Ale has gained my affection.  The color is a solid brown with a bite in the aroma. It has a complex, woody, but dry taste to it and a bit of a tingle from the carbonation. Back to that aftertaste. It is also very dry but, like I said, either I'm used to it or it has been toned down. If that is what you notice at first and it turns you off, be sure to give it a few more tries. You might be surprised.  I wasn't surprised when Consumer Reports rated it the best overall beer based on taste and cost. Of course, since they couldn't review every beer out there, people might not agree. But they aren't way off base.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,masterbruewer,4.1,"Poured a dark golden color with a nice slightly off-white head that was thick and stuck around a while. Steady carbonation.  The smell was hoppy, maybe a little piney and citrusy.  The flavor was strong, but not offensively so, hops, with pine and citrus notes. This had a classic pale ale taste with no off-flavors. A very solid brew.  The mouthfeel was smooth, for a pale ale. The hops are out-front, but not in your face with bitterness. Nice carbonation, but not too tingly.  I could drink this all night long. It is a solid pale ale with strong hop flavor, but none of the disagreeable bitterness and over-pined flavor of some pale ales.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

The Quintessential American Pale Ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,bignick,4.1,"This is known as the epitome of an American Pale Ale, as well it should. It has a nice appearance in the glass, with a slightly cloudy orange color. The lace sticks around until I finish the beer. The smell is citrusy, and so is the taste. The taste is also dominated by hopiness and a little bit of sweetness from the citrus flavor. This is overall a very versatile beer. It is great in the summer and the winter. It is great with or without food. It is, without a doubt, a pleasure to drink.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Hibernator,4,"I have been drinking this beer for years and as of late it has become my staple at most Boston bars/restaurants that have the conventional/limited selection of beers.  This beer is readily available in the area that I live and very reasonably priced for a craft beer of this magnitude at most supermarkets or liquor stores.  For reviewing purposes, I had this out of a 12 oz twist off bottle. I think this is a great label as well, great shade of distintive green with the Sierra Nevada logo to match.  The appearance is a nice burnt orange color. I can smell floral like aromas from the beginning. Nice head on this beer.... maybe 1/2 -3/4 inch or so.  The hop aromas are right there. I think its the balance of the Cascade hops that I dig so much in this beer.  There is a real nice crisp and clean character to this beer. One of my favorite Pale Ales.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,aquatonex,2.74,"I expected more from this Pale Ale, perhaps it was the batch that was the problem. Pours light amber. Smells a lot of hops and alcohol, kinda skunky.

I was not impressed at all.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

I wished there was more carbonation in this beer but it had to do. Smell was quite hoppy for a pale ale. Some citrus undertones with some grain in the background were there as well. Taste was mostly hops as well. Some undertones of malts can be tasted as well in the middle and into the aftertaste. Finally I know what the fuss is about for this beer.

It is the blend between easy drinking and hoppy complexity. This beer has lots of interesting nuances for the sipper but goes well with food and mowing the grass. Along with Liberty Ale by Anchor Steam this beer helped define the American Pale Ale. What also is a bonus is the availibility of this beer even in gas stations and supermarkets.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,RedwoodGeorge,4.3,"Appearance: Ale poured to with a gold-white head that dissipated slowly leaving no lacing. Dark gold color with a slight touch of red.  Smell: Rich without being overpowering, well balanced notes of hops with a hint of yeast and fruit  Taste: Nice malt notes with a touch of hop bitterness at the finish. The taste, like the smell is ""well rounded"" without simple or overpowering notes.  Mouthfeel: Okay but nothing impressive. A bit on the watery side without the desired creamy notes. More like a lager than an ale.  Drinkability: Quite nice and dependable - an ale I'd go for if there wasn't something more exotic to offer. Good with meals because the taste doesn't compete with the food.  [Additional notes] This has become my ""go-to"" beer. Not being as big a drinker as most here on BA, I only drink five or six beers a week. Currently two or three of them are SNPA; I can understand why so many people consider this a gold standard to measure other beers against. While I'm not a ""monster hop"" fan, I've been very fond of the bold, clean hop flavor that's short of an IPA but unmistakably a west coast brew.  Considering how often I keep coming back to this beer, I've upgraded the 'drinkability' score significantly as well as the 'mouthfeel' (those fine bubbles are very lager-like and do a good job of refreshing the palate.)",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Aromas are a little weak, but hops are noticeable. Malts and citric notes are apparent after a good inhale.

A hint of alcohol of you really get your schnozz in there and sniff. Pretty bland tasting I think but it has a nice mix of hops and a touch of citrusy sweetness. It's definitely a drinkable brew. Great for a cookout and a good representation of the style.

The taste is a orchestrated mix of malt sweetness and fruit aftertones. The hop bitterness is just enough to appreciate the sweetness. Hints of lemon/orange zest and fresh rasberries linger in the buds. The roasted malt will show its power in the end.This is a medium bodied pale ale and has that nice crisp but smooth refreshing flavor you need in a nice pale. As far as drinkability goes, you can have a 12 pack a day of these, yes they are that good. SNPA is like the Don Corleone of beers. It is the Godfather.

Light hoppy intro on the palate that blends nicely with the malt and some underlying sawgrass & hay tones.

Sticky sheets of foam cling to the glass with tenacity. perfect lacing. The aroma is impeccable. Soft toasty malt balances citric cascade hops. Very clean, with only a touch of floral esters. The standard for american pale ale. The hops are artfully placed, with impeccable balance. Simple, but effective. The flavor starts with an incredibly clean toasty malt. Chico yeast is a wonderful thing. A touch of lemon, apple and strawberry into the finish, where it meets a solid, fairly bitter citric hopping. The balance on the finish is a thing to behold. The malt maintains it's sweetness, while allowing the citric hopping to even out the balance. A lingering soft grapefruit finish. Medium bodied, with a mild, even carbonation. A very smooth mouthfeel, the standard for american beer. Drinkability? I've had more of these than I can count, and loved every one of them. The standard for american pale ale. The best thing about this beer is that it's widely available, and you can find it at a chain restaurant or run-of-the-mill liquor store anywhere. It's a solid brew, not really stetching the boundaries.

Pours a nice golden amber color with a slight white head that left some nice lacing. Hops are definatly present in the smell with citrus notes. The flavor is very similar to the smell with the hops being upfront but not too much so and a bit of malt and spice is present too. It also has a slight bitter after taste and the mouthfeel is good. The best thing about this beer is its availability, this can be found either on tap or atleast in the bottle and a wide variety of establishments. A good beer to covert macro drinkers over with in my experience, a good taste but not too aggresive.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,rlcoffey,3.08,"Pours a gold to amber color. Virtually no head despite noticeable carbonation. Very slight lacing. Floral aroma that isnt overpowering and wasnt that pleasant. Taste is very average for an APA. The hops are there, and leave a pleasant aftertaste, but they dont stand out like in many APAs. Good ""structure"" to the beer, the mouthfeel is there, but the taste is nothing special. Above average drinkability, I may have another despite being unimpressed. Its been a while since I have had an SNPA and I didnt remember it being anything special - and it wasnt.  Its a slightly above average APA.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,usualpulp,4.42,"Pours a nice amber color with a small white head, which leaves laces down the glass.  Most noteable smells to this beer are hops hope and hops, though there are some great floral undertones, but the number one thing that sticks out is the cascade hops.  The taste of this beer is just great, it starts fruity and flowery with a slight bitterness, then ends with a whallop of hops that hit nice and clean.  This is one refreshing beer, that is one of my standbys and which I almost always seem to have around. This is truely the beer that sets the standard for american pale ales.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Hunter,4.13,"A solid representative of the style. Coppery color, white pillowy head that regenerates well upon agitation. Lovely lacing. The hops come out in the smell, leaving little else for the nose to pick up. Taste reinforces that smell - a nice mild bite of hops, some traces of malt and spice, finishing in a pleasant bitterness and clean aftertaste.  The quality of this ale matched with its relatively wide availability makes it a godsend when stores/pubs see fit to serve only this, Bud, and Budlight.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Dukeofearl,4.57,"Oh, boy, where to start... This is a very good hoppy beer for someone who is not partial to hoppy beers- that's how good it is. Pours a nice dark golden color with a small off-white head. Aroma is floral, slight citrus, and nice hops. The flavor is its best aspect (that's a good thing) and very enjoyable. The smooth flavors follow through with pine and herbal-oily notes. The hops are present throughout the taste, but end very nicely. Moderate clean mouthfeel with some creaminess, but not as much as some others I have had. Leaves a bitter aftertaste that just begs to be covered up by some more SNPA. This is my first 5.0 on drinkability",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,LarryKemp,4.47,"It has been a long time since I have tried this pale ale. I had forgotten what a well made beer it really is. The beer poured a deep golden with a firm tan head. The head faded fast and is probably the least impressive aspect of this beer. The aroma of hops comes through but with each sip the smell of the malt gets stronger. What a joy. The hops on the tongue are not overpowering and the chocolaty, malty taste comes through very strong. The mouthfeel is medium with a tingle of carbonation that lasts throughout the beer. This is a delightful beer that is a joy to drink. No aspect of it rules which makes it a pleasure to sip with a meal or while typing a review. I will most certainly be buying more of these for the fridge.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Aromas are crisp, with citrus and floral notes dominating. Flavor starts with a malty sweetness that is quickly usurped by the cascade of hoppy bitterness. Quite well-balanced and a brisk and short finish that satisfies and keeps you wanting more.

140,276,BadBadger,4.08,"A very pleasant pale ale. Pours a very nice amber color. A nice white foamy head arises at initial pouring, though this decreases to about a quarter of an inch rather quickly.

140,276,Holyterror,3.68,"This is one of the few beers I drink that has a screw-on cap. It took me a while ot notice that. Go figure.  Sierra Nevada makes some of the best mass market beers you can buy, so my expectations were high. I was not disappointed. It poured a hazy golden orange, very appetizing color. The head was moderately thick, good for this style, and settled into a thin white cap and laced the glass pretty well. I lack the vocabulary to properly describe the aroma, but the hops became evident even before the first taste. It had a very grainy taste, heavy on the hop oil, which lingered on into the aftertaste. The hops are very prominent, a plus for me. It is still balanced, and washes down smoothly without leaving excess bitterness on the palate. Good mouthfeel, perfect for this kind of beer. About halfway through the frist glass, it becomes very drinkable. Definite candidate for a session beer, especially if you like the style (which I do).  Definitely recommended as an introduction to the American Pale Ales. Another widely available brew to fall back on as well.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,irishmoss,4.15,"Pours a light golden to slightly amber color that's crystal clear. It has a one-finger head that dissipates to a nice rocky covering and a white ring around the edge. The aroma is light floral hops and a bit of citrus hops as well The taste is just a well-blended balance of hops and malt, which is as smooth as can be. Finishes crisp and at this low ABV, can be enjoyed for the entire night, and I have done that plenty of times.

140,276,abcsofbeer,3.68,"Pours nice medium amber color. I am editing my review about the head and lace. When poured properly there is a very nice 1/4 head that leaves a nice lace down through the glass. Aroma is fairly hoppy and pleasant. Taste is very smooth, but with a definite hop presence. Carbonation is noticeable but light. I have read mostly good reviews about this brew, never a bad one. This is a good standby favorite, one that will be one of my all around favorites.  Taste is moderately spicy, but smooth. I think that pale ales are my preference in beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,andyo,4.07,"this beer has become a standard at my house. My wife loves it, so, it's usually what we get.  What else can I add to the reviews? This one poured really nice, an orange/copper color, with a nice, thick slightly orange head.  This pale ale has a slight bittersweet taste, with grass and citrus notes. Definate hoppy taste, yet not over powering this beer. Very crisp, and very refreshing. A good American Pale Ale- a standard for this style.  After a few years of drinking this beer, and trying many others, the ""specialness"" of this beer is sort of lost for me. Still a good beer, but it just doesn't ""wow"" me anymore.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Aroma: Very earthy with zesty lemon and slightly grassy herbal notes.  Taste: Nicely sharp citric hop bitterness up front, with some bready malt. The mouthfeel is quite smooth and balanced.  Overall: This is the classic American pale ale. It's one of those beers that is good any time of the year. I always have a case of this stuff on hand. This is also a very good beer for those just breaking through into the world of craft beers. It is a very accessible, drinkable beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,HochFliegen,4.24,What a great beer. It pours a nice clear golden color with a good head. The smell is very strong of hops. Very floral and powerful.

Smell: Beautiful grapefruit hops and gentle honey-like malt aroma with additional grainy notes.  Taste: Slightly bitter on the first sip leading to a full grapefruit/lemon taste provided by the cascade hops and an underlying malty sweetness perfectly complimenting one another. Some biscuity and fruity notes round out the taste nicely. Dries nicely on the finish. The most balanced beer I've had in which cascade hops are generally thought to take center stage.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and medium bodied with good carbonation feeling slightly prickly on the tongue.  Drinkability: A great session beer for all the right reasons.

The sweet, crystal-malty aroma follows immediately. It's flavor is moderately malty with a hint of sweetness balanced with a clean bitterness and just enough hop flavor to tilt the malt/hop balance slightly to the hop side. Moderately full mouthfeel. Malt flavors quickly dissipate, leaving a nice hop flavor in the aftertaste.  There are many beers I used to enjoy that no longer taste that good to me. In contrast, every time I grab a six-pack of SNPA, I am pleasantly surprised all over again at what a great beer it is.

140,276,99bottles,3.72,"I had one of these the other night and I can't believe that I never bothered to review this beer that I drink pretty frequently.  Apperance: SNPA pours a golden-amber color and had a nice inch of white sticky head that laces the glass. What I think of when I think pale ale.  Smell: This guy smell like he tastes. Hoppy and slick, with some small malt footing.  Taste: Mmm, mmm. Good old SNPA. This has a ton of Cascade hops pushing a tangy bitterness. They hit hard at first sip, but then they settle down and stop attacking your tastebuds. A good malt base of sweet biscuits balances this over time.  Mouthfeel: Slippery hop oil is the most dominant factor and gives this beer a somewhat heavier mouthfeel than most pale ales.  Drinkability: Yes please. This beer has such a wide distribution, I find myself getting it a lot at restaurants and bars that whose selections are only American macros and this. I could drink these for awhile, but if I had other more exotic beers to choose from this would easily be passed over.

Mouthfeel - A very smooth pale ale, very crisp in the mouth.  Drinkability - Very easy to drink. A great beer to just sit back and enjoy a few. Also a great starter beer to the land of craft brew.  Comments - This is one of my all time favorites. One that I am constantly going back to at least once a month for a revisit.

140,276,yeagerbm,4.55,Fantastic beer. Haven't had this one in a while so I thought it was time to review it. Appearance- Bright orange with a smooth white head. Smell- Hops and malt. The kind of smell that lets you know this beer was dry-hopped and will be delicious. Taste- I had this beer before and knew that it was good. Now I come back to it after trying hundreds of good beers and I see that it is nearly perfect. A delicious aromatic hop experience which is balanced by a great malt flavor. This beer is not extreme. It is wonderfuly flavorful and easy to drink. I don't know if I'll ever give a beer all 5's or if that beer even exists but I don't know if a pale ale can get a better taste than this.  A+ with a smiley face!,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,psyco1,3.9,"I guess I'm more of a porter and brown ale guy, so this can be taken with a grain of salt.  It looks like a pale ale should, there's some yeast on the bottom of the bottle and the head stays for a bit.  The smell is hoppy, somewhat floral and citrusy.  Taste, that's where I just don't get along with this one all that well. I'd rather have a bit more malt presence, it's just too hoppy and bitter for me.  Drinkability, if I had to choose between this and a macro, I'd take this. But, if there was a SN Porter to be had, I'd be all over it.  edit on 10-3-04  I've raised my review score, since I've either started loving the hop, my tastes have changed or the fact that this is one of the few decent beers you can get around here on a night out and I've become more accoustomed to it.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Not bad but not quite as lively as some other pales I've had.  The taste starts with a citrus and slightly malty taste with a decent hop bitterness at the end.  This has a mostly lively mouthfeel, but isn't harsh. The bitterness that helps the taste takes a tiny bit from the mouthfeel.  This is drinkable as most decent American pales are. I have no problem having a few of these.  Overall it's a good beer, but there's at least a couple of local pales that are at least just as good (and possibly better) and I usually go local when I have a choice.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

A standard looking pale ale i might say. Smell is big on hops and citrus as is the taste. Big hoppy notes are present, I wish there was a little more malt flavor in this as the citrus and hops aren't balanced that perfectly to my palate. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both decent.

I have had this on tap previously as well and the odor is generally much more pleasant. The taste was extremely pleasant with a wheat-like malt flavor that is offset by citrus hops. The carbonation is moderate and the drinkability is very good. Overall, this beer goes down nice and smooth and has quickly become my favorite ""normal bar"" beer. It is definitely one of the best American Pale Ales that I have had to-date.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Joey7F,4,I am very impressed with Sierra Nevada after trying their pale ale. I had some of this at a barbeque where we had some spicy indian chicken. The floral hoppy quality of the beer was refreshing and complimented the spicy food. It is very drinkable and is slightly creamy. The tingling after taste is one of the better ones from any beer I can think of. Apparently their other offerings are equally impressive. I can't wait until I can try the Celebration Ale (I just turned 21 so I could get it back when the stores had it) Highly recommended.  --Joey,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,IronDjinn,4,"Appearance is a slighty hazed near-twilight amber, small suspended particles. Head was a thick flash of dense white fizz, which recedes probably due to the hop oil presence. Aroma of cascade hops, citrus, a bit over evergreen and some biscuity malt. Flavour is a nice dose of hops up front, citrus and pine tones, all with an underlying sweet malt body that does a fairly decent job of holding the whole thing together. Full carbonated mouthfeel up front, with a smooth but oily finish that is quenching, this goes down easy. Would definitely like to get my hands on more of this stuff, as I could see a new session favorite in the making.  A classic, was my very first intoduction to American pale ales back in the day, and a pleasure to revisit.

There's a fair amount of hops in here; I think they could even label it as an IPA. I think it would be better with a little more balance, and a small reduction in hops.

I was wondering where the hops were. I could not detect the trademark floral hops that I come to expect with this beer. Despite that, the sweet malts were nice.  The hops were in the taste and they were a nice match to the carmel sweetness.  This beer was a little thin but still smooth and easy on the mouth. A very silky smooth offering from SN.

I see people drinking these wherever I go, so I thought I'd give it another shot since I haven't had it in a couple of months. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale definitely has a bit of kick to it. It pours out a nice amber color with a slight head. The one thing you notice about it right away are the hops. They are bright and outweigh the malt by quite a bit, making it a bit too imbalanced. This causes a dry sensation when drinking it, but it still tastes good.  I polished off a six-pack of this before a Yankees World Series game last October, but I have to admit it was a bit of a struggle near the end of the pack.

In a pint glass, the beer was a brilliant copper-orange hue hazed by a suspension of fine particulates, and topped with a scattered white head that left nice lacing. The nose was mouthwatering, exuding a soft sweetish maltiness and a very lively zingy citric hop bouquet. The taste was firm and crisp, with a dry malt base that presented a limey zip transition into the clean bitter citric finish. The body was richly full.

Sadly, I didn't take any notes so I have to rely on my feeble memory!  After having one of my favorite local beers, Millstream Schild Brau (Amber Ale), I decided I wanted something with some hoppy kick to it and saw the SNPA on tap. Boy, I got what I asked for and more! You can't ask for more hop flavor out of a ""all year"" beer, I mean there was not too much subtley to describe, just knock you on your ass hop clean and fresh hop flavor.1 This beer goes down easy and has a nice head for the style, great lacing. I have no idea why people would drink something like Bud (which laughably touts its high quality hops in their commercials) when stuff like this is available nationally.

Tastes of sweet malt, caramel and tangy fruits segueing into citrusy/spicy hops with a nod towards grapefruit and a bit of pepper. Light to medium bodied but perhaps a wee heavy on the carbonation. Phenomenal drinkability as always. This was the beer that opened my eyes to the potential of American microbrews over 20 years ago.

140,276,WetCoaster,4.12,"Ah, the classic micro. It&#8217;s funny; I drink this ALL the time, but I just realized I&#8217;ve never reviewed it.  Appearance: A moderate pour produces a quarter inch of smooth, off-white foam that lasts for a minute or so. It leaves a ring and some decent lacing. The body is a slightly hazy pale amber with extremely fine carbonation. Pretty, but not a prom queen.  Smell: A really nice balance of hop spice and unusually fruity yeast esters over a base of sweet malt. Mild, conventional, but quite pleasant.  Taste/Mouthfeel: If there&#8217;s such a thing as what pale ale &#8220;should&#8221; taste like, this is it. Starts out rich and malty, with a slightly tangy sweetness. As it moves to the back of your tongue, the bitterness and citrus flavors of the hops makes their presence known, and the finish is crisp and almost ESB bitter. The mouthfeel is smooth, soft and light/medium bodied, although the carbonation is a bit sharper up front than I'd like.  Drinkability: Second to none, IMHO. Probably the most &#8220;sessionable&#8221; pale out there; while it doesn&#8217;t have any strong/outstanding flavors, everything that should be there is there and works together seamlessly.  This beer is sort of like a great bicycle; you don&#8217;t think much about it because it always does exactly what it&#8217;s supposed to do. It&#8217;s easy to understand how this beer help launch the micro revolution&#8212;it never lets you down.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,jwilli7122,3.88,pours gold/amber with a very nice looking medium-sized white head with great lacing. smell is simple citric hops. taste is simple but solid - smooth bready malt taste surrounded by citric hops. there is no hidden treasure - but there is no letdown either. I can see why this is considered by some to be the standard american pale ale. a good beer.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,TinusTime,4.2,"Pours a shade darker than amber with a whispy little head. Aroma is of Hops, nice citrus piney floral hops. Once you smell it you know what you are in for. Taste starts off with a little prickly hops on the tongue , melds into a bit of nice malt in the middle, then drys off strong with the Cascade hops. Mouthfeel is nice with great carbonation keeping the beer from being astringent on the tongue. Drinkability-- I could drink this all day no matter the season. One of the benchmarks for American Pale Ale. For a lot of people i know this is the when all else fails- beer , as it is widely available and often the only craft beer on tap.. This is not a knock because this is a very tasty beer",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,AllThingsNinja,3.91,"Poured into a pint glass, this is a beautiful beer. The perfect white head floats atop a beautiful amber brew that is brimming with hoppy goodness. As I come back to the beer, I'm always impressed by the malty nose that so pleasantly contrasts the intense hop finish. It is a wonderful beer, but it requires a true appreciation of cascade hops to enjoy.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,BuckeyeNation,4,"Quintessential amber with a blizzard of fine yeast suspended within. The beer is topped by a bone white crown that is rocky and pitting as it melts. Unfortunately, the lid didn't last very long. There's a decent amount of lace, though nothing too special. The nose is of average intensity and is primarily of citrusy hops.  The flavor profile is on the simple and straightforward side; not that that's a bad thing. Each mouthful starts out with a gently spicy-bitter push, backed by a solid underlay of malt. Things don't really change in character from start to finish or with warming.  Although SNBC uses Cascade hops (along with Magnum and Perle), grapefruit zest isn't bursting across the tongue. The mouthfeel is slightly more full than medium and has no rough edges whatsoever.  I expected very good things from Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and was just a little let down in the end. It's not that it's bad beer, not by a long shot, but there are better versions out there. I'm sure I'll come back to it again since it's so widely available (and since my local hoppy options are so limited).",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,WOLFGANG,4.15,"Deep amber color with perfect clarity. Billowy long-withstanding white head leaves plenty of lace. Quite appealing in appearance.  Mixture of citrus and floral hops and a nutty aroma lingers. Hints of pine as it warms a bit.  Taste starts tangy with a lemony bite on the palate. Then a slight touch of sweetness ( like nut and honey) is present, but finishes well with slight bitter hop.  A lighter mouthfeel I guess is to be expected.  Built for Summertime enjoyment (IMO). Not hard to drink this throughout the day I imagine.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,flaminghomer,4,this wasn't as bitter as i remember. maybe my palate has grown more loving of pale ales. i don't know.  i noticed that there was sediment at the bottom of the bottle so i gave it a healthy swirl to help make it a bit better looking. i thought that this would make it a bit cloudy but instead it was pretty clear with a bunch of little floaties hoppin about. i guess it's yeast?  taste was very crisp and clean. the hops were not as strong as i remember but they were there. i found it to be very drinkable and good. i'll buy it again.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,RocketWidget,3.93,"Not a bad beer at all. Currently enjoying this brew while waiting for my homebrew wort to chill, so really in the beer mood! Pours a true gold color, with lots of sediment and average head. Smell is crisp and hoppy but not overpowering. Taste sets a very good standard, hoppy and sweet and just enough bitter flavor. A very drinkable brew. Overall recommended.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,BeefyMee,3.94,Appearance: Orangey-yellow with a pillowy head that left nice lacing.  Smell: Very hoppy for a pale ale. The hop aroma isn't all that strong but it is the only thing I can smell.  Taste: Interesting. The hops hit upfront but are not abrasive and even less powerful than the smell. A subtle bready malt flavor follows in the aftertaste. Gets addicting.  Mouthfeel: Surprisingly substantial. Those little bubbles tingle on your tongue so nicely.  Drinkability: I wish I bought a sixer.  Beef Notes: I like this beer more and more every time I drink it. It's quickly becoming a favorite as I develop a taste for hops. I will be buying more.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,PartyHatjo,3.9,"Pours a cloudy, amber color (due to the yeast used in the natural carbonation). The color ""seeps"" a bit into the plentiful head, giving it a not quite white color. The hoppiness is present in the nose, and the taste. I originally didn't like this beer, but after drinking it nearly everyday when I was California, it turned me into a hophead. The bitter-sweet balance is nearly perfect here. I can easily drink a six-pack of this, although the flavor can get harsh towards the end.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,jtfest,3.95,"Somewhat hazy, more orange than yellow, with a smallish off-white head. Light, pleasant, sorta' floral aroma. The mouthfeel was full and consistent. The taste begins very smooth and almost sweet, then blends into a nice mellow hoppy finish for a drinking experience that was far more enjoyable than the appearance promised. I would enjoy this for a session.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,johnrobe,3.88,"A true modern classic and one that started me on the path to better beer. Others have improved on the original, IMHO, but as the trend has been ""bigger is better"" in craft brewing, SNPA retains high marks for drinkability; simply one of the finest session pale ales around. Once I began stockpiling Celebration every year I stopped buying this beer, so this is a homecoming of sorts. It pours a light orange amber with a frothy white head that leaves rings. The aroma is light but dominated by citric hops. The taste is mostly citrus with some pine and is pleasantly bitter. A simple sugar, candy-like sweetness makes a brief appearance on the palate but the malt doesn't develop like some of the bigger PAs. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied and slightly creamy but not heavy, an excellent lunchtime brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,MobBarley,4.45,"A classic. I simply have nothing bad to say about this beer. Deep amber color with some yeasty clouding. Skunky hops aroma with a grainy malt backbone. Assertive hops flavor that balances well with a substantial maltiness. A syrupy bitterness lingers. Mouthfeel is great...tremendously refreshing yet chewy. Drinkability is legend. My ""go to"" beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Zorro,3.06,"I have a love/hate relationship with this brew. Some of the best and worst beers I have ever had were this brew. I believe that this is one beer that is very temperamental about how it is transported and stored.  Pours a clear orangish gold color.  Smell is malt, vanilla and hops smells bitterer than it tastes.  Taste is very mild yet full. This has a floral hop taste with a bit of oak flavor to it. A dry ale, I remember this being a bit sweeter in its draft form.  Mouthfeel is thicker than you would think.  Drinkability is good, but I prefer a Fuller's to this.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,palma,4.03,"Appearance: Sweet-ass looking foggy gold body with some yeast sediment due to the traditional bottle conditioning as it explains on the label. Not much of a head developed on the pour and whatever did faded rather quickly.  Smell: Not very impressed with the smell which had a fruity aroma but also was very leafy and earthy. Smelled kind of like moss...yes, moss. Not what I was expecting but I guess that plant-like aroma was what they were going for.  Taste: Almost a 4.5. Great hop bitterness throughout with strong fruity flavors. At first there is a noticeably sharp hop bite to the beer, but then the malt comes through just enough to give it a perfect amount of sweetness to compensate. Then after a few more sips the bitterness and the sweetness really start to begin to mingle together very well and the brew just gets more enjoyable. I love the lingering aftertaste of this beer which is very dry with an awesome bready flavor.  Mouthfeel is extremely smooth. Has a great light carbonation that gives it a nice crisp and smooth finish.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,coasterfreak75,4.67,"I was really impressed by this beer from the start, my wife purchased it for me as a Christmas present. When I read the label and saw it was bottle conditioned, being a homebrewer, I was excited. The color, a nice copper, was very impressive. The fruity aroma was the next hint I was in for a great drink. The only fault I find is the head retension, there was none. But overall I was greatly impressed with this pour.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,RootedFool,4.6,"&#65279;One of my favorites. Purchased a case for the weekend (edit: my roommate purchased it, because I'm a bum; but I'll drink most of it).  Pours deep yellow, more like gold, and leaves a nice airy tan head that left thick sheets of lace on the glass.  Scent is an earthy, rainy plume of grassy hops. A subtle malt sweetness lies in the background, balancing it all out.  The taste is a glorious flow of bitter-sweet, almost toasty hops. The sweet coming in with the mild malts mixing it up. Aftertaste is rich, earthy, pleasantly gritty (if you can imagine that). Goes down, on the whole, smooth as bitter silk.  Mouthfeel is perfect -- not too thin, not too thick.  An incredibly drinkable beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Stimack,4.42,"A beer that I must say I really love. Pale Ales are one of my favorites and this one does not disappoint! Pours to a nice golden color with a small bubbly head. Small amount of lacing diminishes quite quickly and leaves you an excellent tasting brew! The smell is a somewhat strong hint of citrus and hops making you want to dive right in! The taste is dry and hoppy with a good deal of carbonation. One of my favorite beers of all time, one that I can drink regardless of the season!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Charthepirate,3.95,"Pours a deep golden, with a well maintained head and a thick lacing. Small carbonation and layer of sediment. Very nice looking beer, no doubt.  A nice, biscuity, hoppy smell.  Flavor has a nice bready biscuity maltiness. Flavor is followed by a big citrussy hop bite. Nice, bitterness, but it's a bit unbalanced for my tastes.  Great beer, not above amazing, but I could be happy with a case of it.  Char",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

The taste is great. Again, it has a nice malt palate with a floral hop flavor that really makes this beer. The mouthfeel is good. This is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a beautiful beer that drinks very well; an excellent pale ale.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Rob6852,3.83,Beer came in a 12 oz. brown twist top bottle. Poured a Golden-amber hue with minimal head and lacing. This beers' dominant smell is of citric and hops . For a person used to drinking stouts this was a refreshing turnabout. The taste of this beer is hoppy but not overly dominated by them. The malts even things out but the hops definatly dominate this fine brew. Leaves the mouth dry at the end waiting for the next drink. I'm not really big on hops but am learning to enjoy them. This beer may make a hop lover out of me yet. I can drink several of these in a sitting and not feel overpowered by them. A damn fine beer.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Beastdog75,3.75,"Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is truly one of the beers that helped kick start the micro revolution in America. This was also one of the first ""good"" beers I ever had back in junior year of high school. I remember enjoying it, but being shocked at what I perceived to be just ""dryness."" Obviously, with a much maturing of the palette, I can now fully appreciate this beer.  SN Pale Ale pours an amber-like gold color with a nice foamy white head that retains well, but thins out in about 2 minutes and leaves minimal lace. The smell is truly hoppy, with citric and pine notes being the dominating aromas. Quite clean. The mouthfeel is smooth and lightly carbonated. Very quenching. There is a light maltiness in the flavor that gives an illusion of sweetness, but the hop presence nullifies it and takes over from there. The piney and citric notes return, with a healthy dose of woodiness as well. This beer is slightly drying on the way down. Very crisp, sharp and quenching. The Cascade hop flavors linger for quite some time after the beer is done with, and there is some warmth to finish out this beer.  This beer certainly did not seem as bitter or dry as when I first tried it back when I was 17, but it did have a good, slightly strong hoppiness to it that really makes this beer one of a kind. Adding the yeast sediment contributes some cloudiness to the beer, but I didn't recognize any immediate changes in the flavor. This would be good with some bbq ribs. A good beer if you're trying to slowly convert someone into a hophead, and it is so very easy to quaff a few of these down.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,JackTheRipper,4.5,"Pours a slightly amber golden color, the yeast in the bottle forms a slight haze in my glass. Thin head, no real lacing.  Smell: Citrus, hops, not too punchy.  Taste: Well balanced, the hops definitely stand out most, but there's a good amount of sweetness underneath.  Mouthfeel: Full, good amount of carbonation. Finish is a bit oily. This beer is more warming than I would have expected from a 5.6% ABV beer.  Drinkability: This is a very nice ale, I look forward to my next one. Goes down very well, not too demanding on the taster. Kudos.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,stewart124,4.1,Very nice rusty color with a decent head and beautiful laces left on the glass after each sip. A good amount of hops are present for a sweet smell. An outstanding taste that is not overally hopped up but still gives you that nice flavor of hops and fruitiness in your mouth. This beer really hits your tastebuds and can be appreciated by those who are still new to this style of beer. I recommend this to anyone who is still trying to get a feel for hops. A very nice beer for anytime you want to kick back and enjoy life.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,daledeee,4.22,A nice pale ale. Some say this isn't as good as the brewery got bigger. Pours a nice medium head with a bright straw colored body. Nice piny hoppy nose. A good shot of hops in the taste and some malt. Not as strong as some other American pale ales. But this is very drinkable. Good carbonation and hop finish.  This is a fine beer.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,mschofield,4.1,"Copper-amber with a pillowy white head. Nutty, malty, and citrus hop aroma. Very hoppy taste (orange grapefruit and lemon citrus notes), the grainy malt plays second fiddle.

A very refreshing and tasty brew, a great every day drinking beer and transition beer",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Ieatlambfries,4.3,"This is an excellent example of an American pale ale. Nice appearance, slight chill haze, small head, nice lacing as the head dissipates. The smell is hoppy/citrusy slightly alcohol like. The taste is in my opinion outstanding for the style. Hops are apparent as is a slight citrus taste. Something vegetive also in the background, but in a good way. Mouthfeel was good also. I found it to be very smooth. Extremely drinkable. I could drink this all night at a pub on tap.

140,276,mntlover,3.88,"The pale ale which others are judged by, or so it seems. Nice golden beer with a touch of amber. White foamy head eventually dies to a wring of white bubbles following there way down the glass. Aroma is of hops citrus and flowery with hint of malt. Taste is crisp light hops with light malt coming threw. Mouthfeel is light as it should be great beer for killing thirst after hot day at work.

Wish I had more of this right now...",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,HardTarget,4,"Aroma: Deep citric hop aroma that lets some malt come through. Appearance: Clear dirty blonde/pale orange with a small white head. Collar of head remained but didn&#8217;t lace. Flavor: Grapefruit hops dominate the taste but only leave a moderate bitter. Some bready malt provides a good base. Mouthfeel: Coats the mouth with a medium-heavy body and a slight bitter pucker. Overall Impression: It&#8217;s all about the hops baby. Enough malt to keep it all civilized, but by no means brings it to balance. If you&#8217;re a hophead, this is a refreshing brew, but a bit one-dimensional. Maybe I&#8217;ve just gotten use to the Celebration Ale. This &#8220;Pale&#8221;s in comparison but it&#8217;s an unfair association.

140,276,counselor,4.33,"This beer is one of the classics - It pours a lovely dark golden with a stiff, rocky head that does't quit until the penultimate mouthful. This beer raps you on the nose with lime and bitter hops smell to let you know this is no sissy beverage. The taste backs up the nose with a crispness that hits your throat and all up in your sinsues letting you know this beer is not all about a hop assault on the sense. Qaulity ingrediants and a mild estery flavor from the yeast from bottle conditioning. Yet, after the beer is in your gullet, you are then reminded of where you started, with a dry, citrusy back end from the hops. I could (and have) enjoyed several of these in a setting and welcome each opportunity to do so.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Foxman,4.18,"It pours a golden orange, with a nice off-white head that settles out quickly to a skim of tight bubbles. Lace disintegrates as fast as it clings.  The aroma is very mild, with the expected piney Cascade, along with the requisite malt undertone, though really, until it approaches room temp, the whole aroma is an undertone.  The taste begins with hops, the bitter dryness preparing the palate for the mild malt sweetness that follows quickly. There's a very distant hint of spice that fades just before you can lable it firmly. The hop/malt balance is what gives this exemplary pale ale its understated flavor integrity.  It's light bodied, with the hop dryness supplying a finishing tingle on the tongue and back of the mouth.  I challenge anyone to drink just one of these. The aforementioned hop/malt balance make this beer go down about as smooth as a beer should, with the carbonation and distinguished sweetness performing a olfactory pas de deux with the pine-scented hops. It's a classic, as it should be, and happens to be the first micro-brew to truly wow me, in Winter, CA, roundabout 1992 or so. It was a year or so before I could get it on the east coast, but since that time, I've never hesitated to fall back on SNPA's stylistic excellence and wonderful flavor.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,BrianOfMayberry,4.4,"A very fine (as well as a defining) example of American Pale Ale. Just the right amount of hoppiness and just enough malt presence to balance it out. It has become one of my favorite table beers... I would consider Sierra Nevada Pale to be a ""standby."" When I play gigs in a bar and I am greeted by a sea of ""lite beers"" on tap, it is very comforting to see the green tap handle there in between the typical brands.. The bottled version is just a notch below the on-tap version, but it stands up well -- probably because it is bottle conditioned... The color suits a beer of this style. It is suitably pale, but has an orangish-red glow that make it very appealing.

140,276,merlin48,3.98,"Fortunately, this brew IS widely available, even out in the boondocks of the central Appalachian mountain coalfields, in my case at a beer store near Pound, Va, near the Ky/Va line. Pours a a just off-clear amber, with no real head. Minimal lacing. Nose is powerful, lemon rind and hops. Mouthfeel fizzles the tongue with carbonation and initial bitterness of citrus and hops. Feels pretty nice. Taste is excellent for a pale ale. Pine and some spice are in the background somewhere. Alcohol is well disguised, but definitely lets its presence be known after a couple of these. Some excellent malt flavor balances the hops toward the end of the glass. I've always felt a bitter aftertaste from this brew, but that's not a major issue, especially if you're having it with pizza.

Very fresh, and slightly evergreen.  Taste: Creamy up front, with a nice malty middle. Not much in the way of sweetness, and what there is gets kicked out before closing time by the fresh hop finish. Yeast is hardly noticeable, except for a brief moment every now and again. Finishes dry and clean, with a refreshing tingle.  Notes: This has to be the ultimate fall-back beer, since it tastes good and is extremely widely available. Makes for a wonderful session beer also, with enough hops to break through even a saturated palate.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is, hands down, 1 of the best overall beers out there!! and that's a bold statement!!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,GreenWBush,4.25,"With as many boxes of SNPA that have piled up in the last couple weeks, it is finally time for me to critically review this beer. This beer has definetely become my default of choice as it is available almost everywhere, and in most podunk towns, it is the only bottle-conditioned choice.  Color is relatively uninviting, a golden-brown-amber. A good head comes up, but dies almost instantly. I found little to no lacing on the glass. The taste is sharp on the tongue at first, but then the Cascade hop kick gives way to a rich maltiness.  The maltiness is steady throughout the palate, complemented by a short hop-kick to close out the swallow. The alcohol is hidden quite well in there. This is really almost all I drink, its sad to think that most establishment's closest runner up to this beer is Sam Adams.  I used to think that this beer was very hoppy, now really all I can taste is malt. I've been ""ruined"" one too many times.

This is an outstanding beer that is readily available even in the most remote parts,  Copper/amber in color with a respectable off-white head. Good lacing effect too. Fresh hops dominate the nose. The taste is much more balanced between hops and malt. Starts with a caramel sweetness that is quickly attacked by a very fresh hop flavor (Cascade hops I believe).  Probably the best readily available beer on the market.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,winomark,3.6,"Appearance: Light copper color with a thin white head and lots of streaming bubbles.  Aroma: Good hops and malt on the nose, nicely balanced.  Taste: Again, nice balance of malt and hops throughout the palate. Hops take over in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Crisp and refreshing. Somewhat tannic on the finish.

140,276,farHillsBrewer,4.42,"This is the standard by which all American Pale Ales are judged. Some may be better, but this is the best seller, the one that has penetrated markets and contends for the title of King of Beers. The slight chill haze is easily excusable since SNPA is bottle conditioned. The aroma provided by generous amounts of Cascade hops is a quite evident spicy-flowery-citrusy, that pleases throughout the lace coated glass. A hint of sweet malt covered by some underlying bitterness provides excellent balance. Each swallow finishes with a crisp hoppiness that begs for more.This is a great session beer, not that I'm inclined for excess, you understand, that works for picnics, parties, and for those of you who understand, crab feasts.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,goz,4.4,"Pours a golden orange, with a decent sized white head that somewhat lasts, and laces quite well on the descent. Aroma is all about the cascades - floral, piney, citric...maybe a tiny hint of bready malt in the back. Flavor starts with a small bit of malt, and then come the beautiful flavors of the cascade hops, rolling all over the tongue.

I like the bottled Sierra and choose it over any other mass-produced American beer. I consider Sierra a mass-produced beer at this point since they have grown so large.  The tap version of this is superior to the bottle, which led me to comment. It has a nice amber appearance in the glass with little aroma to speak of (Of course, I was drinking it in a place that was using a lot of fried onions.) I loved the taste. It has a very earthy taste to it. Lots of grain appeal. It gets better as you let it warm. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean, and you can drink a few of these without even realizing it.

SN is nearly as dark as Newcastle, and has many of the same flavor characteristics as the famous Brown Ale. SN definately qualifies as a full-bodied ale with an almost nut-like finish.

The hops stick out a little more yet the malt is still there with a little spice to make it nice.  The taste seems more hoppier than its bottled friend. The hops are more pronounced and fresh.

Pours a clear, translucent orange with a medium head that fades and leaves some lacing and a thin coat atop the liquid.  The smell is very fruity and sharp with a good presence of hops in it. Very malty as well.  The taste, puh, very malty with lots of orange presence complimented with a back-of-the-throat bitterness, very strong. Perhaps a bit too sweet. Not very carbonated either.

SN Pale Ale pours a nice deep hazy copper-gold with a nice thick, clumpy head. The aromas are clean and pure, a nice floral and hoppy (Cascade?) nose. The taste is what makes this beer stand out for me--an absolute redefinition of quaffable. The taste reflects the nose with a nice dose of hops, sweet malty middle, and some more hops in the slightly bitter finish. I wish I was more adept and describing my perception of this beer, but alas I will let it speak for itself.

It is obviously very hoppy, so much so that it may scare aware some. To my taste it hits the spot any time of year.

140,276,RoyalT,4,"Appearance  Nice, light orange body with an OK head.  Smell  Sensuous hops aroma consistant with the style and the very slightest hint of pine tells us that this one is serious.  Taste  It tastes like a lot of different hops in there. I get a little citrus, but not quite like an orange, and a lemon without the sourness (if that makes any sense). Some hops seem to have a strong floral taste, whereas others are a little bit more crisp. This is a hop-lovers delight.  Mouthfeel  This feels great in the mouth. The carbonation is small, of course. The brew has a consistancy that just glides along the cheeks and gums. Nice job, SN.  Drinkability  This one has it all. Its complex yet purposeful. There is an abundance of flavors in there, yet we know right away that its an American Pale Ale. In fact, this one would be a great reference taste for other pale ales.  Comments  I have been very impressed with the offerings from this brewery thus far (this is my fourth SN review).  Update  I first reviewed this beer the same month that I joined the site, so I thought it would be fun to revisit it with the 2004 vintage now that I have 1,000+ reviews under my belt.  This really is an understated but incredible Pale Ale. The nose is big on the hops and very complex, but the taste is expertly balanced. Its everything good in a mild sort of way. I think this is the most often named beer when folks ask the perennial BA question in the forum, Whats the best beer to introduce a macro drinker to craft beers. Im upping my Drinkability rating from 4.0 to 5.0 while bowing in the general direction of Chico, CA.  Update  I had a few bottles of 2006 and thought it was grainier since I last remember. It is a terrific beer but just seemed so ordinary this time around. Its a definite 4.0 across the board at this point.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Realale,4.17,"Pours a beautiful full gold, with just a blush of copper. Fine sticky 1/2"" head settles slowly to thin, complete cap.  Cascades! Grapefruit City. But there's a nice bit of piney freshness as well, and the underlaying biscuity malt base is not obliterated by the hops. A bit too much hop to be well-balanced, in my particular parlance, but nicely done, nonetheless.  Medium full in the mouth, with the malt slightly outweighing the good hop flavor on the palate. Great length from the hop bitterness, and the bottle-conditioned carbonation level is just right, lightening the body a bit, and scrubbing the hops from the palate in preparation for the next sip. Easy to down several of these.

Head isn't huge, but a light lacing hangs around for a remarkably long time, adding even more to the visual appeal. Smells exactly the way it tastes, maly, hoppy, but neither particularly overdone. There's a reason why this one's so well regarded. Being tasty, and remarkably easily available for its quality, this is for me effectively the standard against which other pale ales must be measured. So easy to get, that when looking at other pale ales, the first question just has to be ""how's it stack up against Sierra Nevada?""  In summary, a good, solid ale.

Drinkability gets a 5 because this is an ideal session ale. A gorgeous beer. I buy it by the case.  It's not incredibly complex but the hops used here are delicious on the palette and nose -- evidence of intelligent, careful brewing. There are mild esters in the background but not unusually flowery like HopDevil. Bitter but not unpleasant. The hops here are a flavor, part-and-parcel of the beer, instead of some crazy quasi-adjunct that's there just to burn people's tongues off. There's even an influence of American pale lager in this beer on the nose, in a good way, -- somewhat Pilsnery. Clean, smooth body with a very controlled hop bite and medium malt.

140,276,SteveP,4.07,"I am really pleased to get this - from what I understand this is the original American Pale Ale, a style which is making something of an impression over here in the UK, it's path having been laid by the popularity of the Golden Summer Ales which have a similar hop profile, though are softer and cleaner in the palate. The aroma is quite heavenly - delicate, floral and spicily citric, though that does die down after a while into something more grassy and rain like, even a touch metallic. When worked slightly the pale malt aroma does rise, but doesn't last long against the hops. The taste is surprisingly clean up front, but the sweet malt soon makes an appearance, slightly sticky but with a rounded body - a satisfying base from which the citric hops do their work, gradually taking over from the sweetness to emerge dark and tangy in the finish.

Drink the damn thing if it's 20 years old. It is a delight. Hoppy, but not overpowering. Sweet enough to make it that year round treat. Dry aftertaste indeed. But it has that pale ale citrus flavor that everyone loves. So drinkable, it is a shame more people do not love it. If it takes you more then a day to finish (given that you are one to finish a 6er in a day, extenouating circumstance not standing) you got some problems, cause even the ""Bud-Light Boys"" are down with this delight.

Caramel aroma is surpassed by citrusy hops, with floral and herbal tones finding their way to your nose as well. The taste is earthy, with a moderate to low hop presence, and some peppery notes as well. The mouthfeel is appropriately carbonated & slightly coating, with hop oils relaxing on your pallet. Notes: This is quite enjoyable. The hop levels are subdued for a pale ale, but perhaps this is closer to the intended style. It is apparently quite a popular beer, and I can see why &#8211; It can be equally embraced by the masses looking for a change, and beer geeks alike.

Nice patchwork of lace left behind as the beer went down.  Smell: Citrusy/flora hops with a sweet malt aroma.  Taste: Starts off with a smooth sweet malt taste and citrus hops.

Not crazy-hoppy.  Feel: Very clean and smooth. Not fizzy despite appearance of lots of carbonation.

Did I mention lots of citrus flavor? Classic cascade hop taste. It's almost more an IPA than a basic Pale Ale. The malts are also very well balanced in this beer. Sweet and smooth. Not as present as the hops, but complimenting them perfectly. It finishes with a long lingering bitterness that mellows nicely.

Gave off a nice scent of floral hops with a sweet malt smell in the background. Starts off sweetly like some English bitters I've had, and then the hops kick in. Whoa! Big hop zap! The hops definitely win out over the malt in a big way, finishing off with a big, crisp citrusy note. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but compared to a macro pale, its like a stout. Definitely hits the spot on a warm day (like, say...today!), so long as you are not afraid of a little hoppiness - then again, who in their right mind gets a SN and DOESN'T expect hoppiness. What perplexes me is that my brother, who dislikes hoppiness (he won't even touch an IPA) loves this, and cites it as his favorite beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,RenoZymurgist,3.24,Thick white head subsides at a medium pace. Nice amber color with adequate carbonation. The hops are very prevalent and this is refreshing for a pale ale. Aroma of citrussy hops with a hint of sweet malt. Mouthfeel is a bit light but good for a pale ale. the carbonation bits enough to let the hops ring through the maltiness.

The taste is malty and hoppy. Very smooth mouthfeel, and well balanced. I tried this beer once before quite a while ago, and didn't care for it.

140,276,freed,4.72,"I consider this the benchmark. The continental divide. Beer flowing to the east should go back to the drawing board. Beer flowing to the west is how life should be. And those beers are tributaries that flow into the great standard. I don't mean to make SNPA sound like an amalgamation of beers, but its really just one of those great confluences of smell, appearance, taste, and enjoyment.  It pours a rich golden color. As the pour slows, the head billows up with a turbulent cap that settles with a nice crisp rim of foam. The aroma is of ample fresh hops, bursting is bright green flavors. The first sip is crisp, malty, and satisfying. Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter, its always the same taste. With a nice malt background the hops are a wonderful compliment. The biscuit and the citrus are a wonderful mix.

140,276,JoeyHotrod,4.15,"A truly wonderful beer. This beer was the one that made me a true and proud hophead. Upon pour the ale is a beautiful golden color with a nice head that sticks around for some time leaving a nice lace. A quick sniff of the beer instantly brings says hops. Not just any hops mind you, but cascade hops some of the most wonderful of all hops. Taste wise you are treated to full frontal hop brilliance. Some floral notes, citrus notes here and there with just enough malt to balance things out. Truly world class in every way and one of my personal faves.  Edit: 9-11-06  Going to have to drop my ratings just a tad after having this beer numerous times since this initial review from 2003.  While I'll always have a soft spot for this beer and will continue to drink it from time to time, I've since had better examples of the style. Still a classic.... though no longer world class imho.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,nomad,3.7,"Poured a pale gold that was strongly orange-hued. Also had a huge frothy head, very little carbonation, and a lil' bit o' lace. Smelled of fresh hops and clean malt, but mostly hops oil. Also had some clean and easy scents of grapefruit, all faint and moderate though. Did I mention the hops. Taste is a pleasant refreshing bitter with a soft golden malt underneath. The yeast imparted an earthiness and combines with bitterness; the flipside is that the yeast creates not the best finish. With a smooth watery mouthfeel a touch viscuous from all those hops, this beer has great drinkability. In all a simple quality pale, in fact, the classic.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,xgrigorix,3.75,"Pale amber color, with a tight crisp white head.  Floral scents, with lemon mix with hop aromas.  Medium body. Excellent malt character along with raw grain flavors.

140,276,elmocoso,4.38,"This one looks a true gold color when held up to the light. There is a small but faithfull head and good lacing along the side of the glass. Very active carbonation, though does not sting the tongue.  A big whiff of cascades when poured but after sitting 4-5 minutes, the smell recedes leaving a maltyness and slight alcohol character.  This is a good tasting beer, better when slightly warmer than fridge temp. A clean crisp balance of maltyness and hop-bitterness. Feels real good on the tongue and in the belly.  One of the best session beers around. You can't go wrong here. Grade A drink!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

On tasting, it has a fair bit of hoppy taste without overwhelming the rest of the beer. At 5.6% ABV, the alcohol is low enough to be able to have quite a few in a session!

140,276,far333,4.1,"This is a rock-solid beer. Consistent, smooth, and full of character without hitting the senses too hard. It's a great ""old faithful"" beer for me. Many bars that don't serve great beer or have vast selections will offer this, so I know that my chances are good that I will be happy at most places. It also goes great with most foods. It pours from the bottle a dark amber with a white head that hangs out for a while and produces fine lacing around the glass. The smell is hoppy and yeasty. The flavor also is hoppy, with some yeast and fruit undertones. Not a strong malt flavor, but there is a lingering bitter hop aftertaste. Very smooth, very drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Admiraldinty,4.32,"I've reviewed this before in the bottle. Had this on tap at Orleans in Davis Square. This beer is much better on tap.

It pours golden amber in color with a nice full white head. The head diminishes rather quickly leaving lacing behind on the glass. A thin layer of fine bubbles linger throughout. An overall very nice looking beer in a glass. In tipping back a glass you are met by a nice aroma of hops with floral undertones. This beer has a great taste, dominated by hops, although a light citrus flavor comes through. This medium bodied beer feels very smooth in the mouth, which in addition to its taste contributes to its high drinkability.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

Aroma was straight up hops and IMO freshly mowed grass. Taste was fresh floral hops, some citrus hops and a balance of malt. Mouth feel was smooth with a slight twist and some carbonation and made this a smooth and easily drinkable beer. I got no bitterness from this beer which made it very enjoyable. Good beer all in all.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

And a couple years later, it still is. It's something of the standard, I think, as far as American micros go, especially with regards to pale ales specifically.  A nice clear, tan color with a white head that lingers in parts for most of the pint. Aroma reminds me of walking down the aisle with all the herbs and spices without actually smelling any one single spice; it's subtle and fresh, but it's not terribly powerful. The definition of balanced use of hops, it finishes with a nice crisp and clean hop bite after a malty-to-citrus flavor. The bitterness lingers just for a while. Really easy to drink, this brew isn't spectacular, but it's quite good.

140,276,Jarod,4,"This beer came to me a crystal clear golden yellow color that was teaming with tons of dancing bubbles of carbonation. The head that was produces was exactly 1 inch thick, pure white in color and was thick and creamy in nature. The head seemed to last a good way down the glass and produced a sheet like lace at the top and delicately designed lace as it traveled down the inside of the glass. The aromas that came from the glass were of citrus hops, bitter hops, citrus fruit (lemons, grapefruit), and some sweet malts. The tastes that were produced were creamy in nature, good carbonation and the flavors that came out were of sweet malts, citrus hops, floral hops, fresh fruit (grapefruit), grass, and more hops. The combination of the sweet malt and the hops seemed to keep each other in good balance. It was crisp the whole way through and ended with slight hop dryness.

Carbonation is perfect, also has slight piney taste. Malts are subdued per style, but are there to balance everything out. Very solid and tasty beer.

The Cascade hops are very apparent, with a luxurious,strong fruity scent. A mellow sweetness is noticed first, then the powerful hop presence dominates. Definitely a hop-head's beer. A bitter, full taste follows the swallow...very yummy. The medium body leaves a nice fizzle on the tongue. Sharp and very satisfying.

Taste: The malt/hop balance leans more to the hops, with grapefruit and citrus flavors in the forefront. The malt backbone is a bit thin, and is bready and slighty fruity.  Mouthfeel: The thickness is on the lighter side of medium, along with a crisp, dry mouthfeel.  Drinkability: Pretty good.

This was a little to hoppy, but overall this is a great taster. Good balanced fresh hops with a bit of citrus and finishes dry and piney. This was actually hard to pin down as far as taste for me due to the finish happened to fast and I was feeling and wanting more. I still thought it was good but something was missing for me on the overall taste. Malt was present. Color was fine for a pale, kinda coppery yellow, with a nice floral aroma with good strong hop presence. I almost liked the smell more then the taste by just a bit. Solid pale, I can see why alot of folks like this stuff. This is a drinkable pale, very good, but needed something for me to really enjoy it fully. I kept a puzzled look on my face after every sip.

Smell: Slightly rustic, raw and mildly pungent hop aroma of leaves, flowers and heavy on the citric fruit. An undertone of grain is in the background also.  Taste: Creamy smooth with a soft malt crispness that cradles a bready malt flavour. Hop bitterness is more than ample and shows off a bit yet there is an underlying sweetness that seems to put everything back together. Esters through a shadow of alcohol down which make a potential heady night. In the finish is a citric hop flavour with a touch more sweetness from the residual sugars, though this brew seems to dry up a little in the end.  Notes: The typical American Pale Ale ...

Their Pale Ale pours a cloudy golden hue with bits of hops that eventually settle at the bottom of the glass and a thick, lasting head. The aroma is surprisingly pronounced and fruity -- citrus with apple undertones. The taste is an excellent balance of spicy hops and sweet malts. Mouthfeel is crisp, with moderate carbonation.

Smooth texture, light body, but fully flavorful. Uncomplicated and refreshing. Bitterness is low, malt is firm. Perfectly balanced, and infinitely enjoyable! In past years, I'd given this staple micro less credit than it deserves. I thought all pale ales were alike, and this one wasn't extraordinary to warrant the attention it receives.

There was a big hops aroma, balanced with fruit, some malt, and a bread-like smell.  Mouthfeel: Great mouthfeel for a pale ale. This brew had a medium body and was very smooth.  Taste: A great hops bitterness, balanced by lightly roasted malts. Occasionally, a little sweetness shines through. The finish drys out but the hops flavor just lingers and lingers . . .

A great citrusy full sharp delivery of wonderful cascade hops fiil me with joy. The staple of American pale ales, and this one is bottle conditioned which adds to the aroma to form a balanced full aroma with the blend of hops, yeast, and malt. The sweetness mixed with the decent amount of bittering hops does wonders for the soul, if the brewery in Chico had a church I might become a cult member. The hops are grapefruit citrusy flavored that tickle the back of the throat and at the same time the warming feeling of acohol crashes upon the palate just right. It is full of flavor and it is just the right texture to deliver the flavors, and it with the medium body this beer is one to be enjoyed all night.

I like to think that Pacific Northwest Pale Ale is a sub-style of American Pale Ale and Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is the quintessential (and original) interpretation.  Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is yellowish, almost orange colored and has a huge, airy, white head that leaves a lacy curtain of dried bubbles on the inside of the glass. An intense, grapefruity hoppiness dominates the nose and overshadows the sweetish, almost biscuity malt in the flavor. The resiny, almost sticky hoppiness lingers on and on and almost causes you to forget that there's some really good, sweet maltiness hiding deep inside the bottle. Somewhat incongruously, the malty portion of the beer is relatively dry (not surprisingly, considering the 78%+ attenuation), while the hops don't let the flavor go quietly. Instead, the citric stickiness hides out in the back corners of your mouth, creating an almost sour sensation (not sour from sugar, like in a Coke, but sour from citric, like from grapefruit). In my mind, this is the primary difference between American and British hops. The British hops do a tremendous job of bittering sweet malts like Maris Otter, while the American finishing versions, like Cascades, aren't as much bitter as they are resiny, citric and robust.  Anyhow, I'd say that SNPA, although the originator of the style, would now do better in a beer competition as a British IPA, expect for those American hops. It's the sparing use of caramel malt that lends the primary difference. Most other APA's tend toward having a more pronounced malt flavor to compliment the hops, while SNPA (and those brewed in its ilk, like Rogue's Oregon Golden Ale) really feature the American hops. I find it ironic that the creator of the style wouldnt be able to win an award for the style.  Although not my favorite APA (a little too harsh, without enough balancing maltiness, just a little too prickly in the mouth and with a touch of sourness) I still drink quite a bit and will continue to do so for as long as SN remains such a great producer of quality beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Reidrover,4.09,"I had heard a lot about this beer from other ""micro"" beer drinker, so when it went on sale for $4.99 a six i thought i,de give it a go. Pours pretty nicelly, but doesnt hold a head to well, the smell is good. Has a nice after taste to it , thiough the feel in the mouth is pretty average. I was drinking this with a hang over already so maybe i found the drinkabilty less than i would have in top condition LOL",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Amdahl,3.87,This beer pours a nice amber with about 2 fingers of head. A nice lace covers the side of the glass all the way to the bottem. The head doesn't go down very fast. A nice floral hops smells great on the nose. The taste is hoppy with a floral overtones. This is a very good Pale Ale that is not very full-bodied.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,GreatPondBrewer,4.43,"This is definitely one of the classic american ales on the market, and I was glad to find a six-pack hidden on the shelf of my local supermarket. The pour revealed a nice amber/dark golden color. There was a thin head that disappeared after about a minute, but a nice lace remained until the last sip. The smell was a crisp, sharp one with some nice fruity(citrus??) hops. The first taste revealed more of those hops and a pleasant bitter taste that receded quickly and left a nice dry aftertaste. Overall a very good brew that I would recommend to anyone!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,francisweizen,4.5,"A CLASSIC, what can I say about this beer. Well, it pours a nice dark amber colour into my pint glass, with not that much of a head to be found. It smells of *raspberries*, fruity hops, and some nice background malts. It tastes more of the same, hoppy, malty, fruity, bitter, and dry...wonderful! This has a nice crisp, and full mouthfeel, like any APA should which lends to it's very high drinkability. a beautiful beer! cheers! F",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,GeoffRizzo,4.6,"Pours well, keeps a white foamy head throughout, which is impressive. Has a yellow-orange appearance, and smells great. Has an earthy, fruity, all around awesome taste, extremely smooth. The slight bitterness is proven in the aftertaste, but this beer goes good with anything, or any scenario. Sad I didn't try this one this sooner. Awesome brew!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,cretemixer,3.98,Pours a beautiful deep golden hue with a thick off-white head. Head dissapates to a thin layer after a minute or so and leaves a fine white lace. Aroma is nicely balanced with a slight floral odor which is very pleasing. Really clean balanced taste as well with a slight spicy/sweet hop bitterness. Well carbonated and refreshing. A fine example of American pale ale.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,mickstepp,4.47,It's hard to believe that I'm just now getting around to reviewing this beer. This was the first American Pale Ale I ever tried and it was an epiphany. I still consider it one of the best and the benchmark for the style. Nice golden color and a decent head and lacing. That wonderful citric hop aroma and the crisp grapefruity taste. Just tart enough and with a nice supple mouthfeel. I could drink this stuff all day. There are hoppier pale ales and there are more complex ones but there are none that are consistently better.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,kelticblood,3.97,"Being my first time trying this brew or anything from Sierra Nevada I didnt know what to expect.The appearence didnt do much but the smell and flavor is what got me.A great hop and citrus taste accompanied this clear light yellowish orange Ale.It has a high drinkability percent ,but i'd wish it was ust a bit more maltier.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,purplehops,4.22,When I think of American Pale Ale this is the beer I think of. It is a brassy yellow-orange with a white head that clings to the glass as you drink. The aroma is very floral with notes of hop spiciness. The taste starts with a pleasant maltiness that is not over powering and just the right amount of carbonation to get your attention without taking away from the malt flavors. The finish is crisp and dry with plenty of hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is a pleasant medium full maltiness with well balanced carbonation and hop bitterness. It has been a while since I have had a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. My loss! This is a good example of what an American Pale Ale should be. Well balanced with all of the ingredients evident in the aroma and taste without one or the other over powering each other. I think I will have another!,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Riggo,4.07,"A classic american west coast pale ale from Sierra Nevada, a brewery that oozes integrity.  This ale pours a beautiful honey-gold color with a rocky, off-white head and medium head-retention. The nose is a beautiful bouquet of grass, hops, and citrus with some later notes of yeast and wheat. At palate entry, spicy bitter hoppiness and leafy, floral notes. At mid-palate, yeasty, caramel malt notes appear. As it warms, notes of bread dough and cracker. The mouthfeel suffers from too much ""spritzy-ness"" and the overall flavor is too bright and citrusy. A very good APA, but would benefit from some more depth and earthy, malt balance. The Finish is crisp, clean and dry.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,JISurfer,4.03,"Great googily moogily!!! This is a very good beer out of the bottle. It is ranked in the Top 5 of best bottled beers I've ever had. I'm usually not this big of a fan of American brews persay, but this is up there with my favorite European beers. I know it may sound crazy, but it's true. I saw that Consumer Reports gave it a good review, so I thought I would try it, and I must say that they know what they are talking about. The taste is ""wheaty"" and has a smooth delivery. It doesn't have a harsh aftertaste and leaves light on the palate. This is a must for anyone who is into wheat ales.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Shiloh,4.2,"This brew is a class act! The golden hue of this offering is very deep and mid dark. The body is medium plus, but, it is the taste that gets you and holds on...the taste is of a slight bitterness from the hops which fails to leave, but is more somehow, mellow, crisp. Very rewarding.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,alittlehazy,4.25,"Man, I can drink this beer all day! Nice citrusy taste, moderate carbonation and nice apperance coming out. Dry finish, very refreshing.

140,276,rockdick,3.53,"This was my first pale ale to try and it wasn't too bad. Had a good light copper color with a decent head. Taste and smell was a hint of spiciness, but mostly sweet. Went down pretty easily. I don't think it belongs in the Top 50, but it is worth have a 6 pack on hand for pale ale drinkers.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,BeerBuilder,4.5,"This Pale Ale is a favorite of mine. It truely defines the American Pale Ale style. It pours to a beautiful copper color, with an off-white head that lasts. It forms a nice lace-work as it is sipped down. It has a bit of chill haze as well. The aroma is mainly of a citric, spicey hop nose. On first taste, one first noticies to floral, citrus hop flavors. The hop flavors are balanced out though by a biscuity malt flavor. This beer is light-medium bodied, and finishes with a dry hop bitterness that lingers. Overall, this is one tasty brew, with a exceptional hop and malt flavor.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90

140,276,Morris729,4.22,"Pours a clear medium amber color with a thin white head that quickly dissipates into a nice lace. Nose is composed of hay, grains, and bitter hops. Flavor is a malty bread-like sweetness with fruity notes of grapefruit and lemon and a pleasant bitter aftertaste. It feels crisp and creamy in the mouth and leaves you wanting another. A great pale ale!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,rastaman,4,"Good stuff!!! Floral hoppyness on the nose, lots of fruit-lychees, passionfruit, grapefruit, with some tea like qualities.

140,276,HossMcGraw,4.27,"Not too shabby. Nice smooth piney flavor. Not quite as smooth as other pale ales I've tried but that's how it's unique and I like that. It's definitely got a very cool, raw edge to it out of the bottle that I don't encounter on draft. Everybody likes this.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,bditty187,4.3,"Transparent, copper hue with a white head that reached a solid finger, then laced nicely. The nose was soft yet inviting, the citrusiness of the hops is foremost, there are hints of caramely malt... this is a nice bouquet. For all intensive purposes, this Pale Ale is near flawless and worthy of its classic beer status. The palate has an absolute wonderful balance of hops and malt the citrus & tanginess mesh with the caramely malt there is no flavor gaps. The carbonation is near perfect. This is an outstanding beer and a must try for any beer drinker.  Note: This beer could realistically be rated with straight 5s.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Dogbrick,3.53,Had the draught version at California Pizza Kitchen. Considering how widely available this beer is I'm surprised it took me this long to try it. Not the best APA I have had but still better than average. Good bitter hops flavor and somewhat dry. It is nice to know there are actually decent beers at the grocery store.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,TheLongBeachBum,4.13,"It has been warm today in Long Beach, and I found that by 6pm, I had imbibationally destroyed 50% of the Six Pack I bought a while ago. A solidly great drinking Pale Ale, and whilst I lived in UK, this was considered by many Limeys to be the best exponent of the APA style. As I worked my way through the bottles, I was amazed that I kept ""finding"" additional facets to this beer the more I drank it. I think its beauty is the way it can seem so simple, but yet retain such complexity under closer scrutiny, so much so that I find myself struggling to explain my tasting to be honest. On one front is a solid thirst quenching hoppy beer that has a lovely fruity hop-oil aroma with a lingering bitter finish. But in other dimensions, the more I concentrate it has a malty light biscuity oatmeal taste that really complements a citric hoppy bitter finish. A Marvellous Quaffable Beer, considered a standard fall-back beer in most bars in CA - but much, much more complex than people realize IMHO. Fantastic!!!!. Hmm. Those remaining 3 bottles look really lonely.......",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,putnam,4.05,"Good, vigorous head. Simple yello-brown color. A big, sticky nose of broad, meaty herbs, like beet tops. The palate displays a mild, well tempoed segue of toasted malt to hop bitterness. There is an overall steamy quality to this beer, reminiscent of a hot tub in a pine forest. Rich, creamy and velvety, easily bearing elements of grain and flower. Alcohol driven but not out of balance.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,hyuga,4.73,"Pale copper color and a large, impressive white head with great retention. Leaves a huge amount of beautiful lace. Refreshing hoppy aroma of citrus and a bit of pine. Characteristic pale ale malt aroma behind that, which I assume is from pale grain. Crisp citrus and pine-like hop character hits first. Specifically, the initial wave of hop bitterness reminds me of a Christmas tree. Not far behind is a grain-like maltiness, also very crisp. Just above medium-bodied, but good and complex. Hoppy, but still very well balanced. High drinkability, very refreshing. Wonderful pale ale that is worthy of being considered one of the nation's top microbrews.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,BeerAngel,3.7,Pours a light orange color with a 2 finger head that hangs in through half of my SNPA trip and leaves a lace all the way down. Smells of hops and a light woody smell that gets your mouth watering. The taste is initially crisp with a taste of bread and tons of hops that is characteristic of S.N. It has a light bodied mouthfeel and this is a beer that I could drink a few of these bad boys. Cheers!,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,NeroFiddled,4.36,"Bright, clear golden amber in color with a 3/4"" head that holds well, eventually dropping, but leaves a complete surface covering. Very nice.The aroma offers bright, fresh, floral & citrusy hops over a light maltiness. The body is medium-light with a fine, crisp carbonation. The flavor is a combination of tangy, fruity, citrusy hop flavors and a very lightly caramel & biscuit maltiness well backed by bitterness. It finishes dry with a short lingering hoppy bitterness and a bready/biscuity maltiness. Extremely well balanced. Very refined. Crisp & refreshing. Highly drinkable.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,aaronh,4.06,"My favorite trait of this beer is the wonderful head atop the beautiful dark amber body when you pour it into a pint glass. I wish every beer could look this good. The aroma is a bit of a floral perfume aroma. You know this one is high on the aroma hops. Take a sip and you taste just a slight hint of sweetness, and then get more of a grapefruit and lime citrus sensation. The beer finishes very well. Bitterness is more prevalent on the finish as the beer warms, but it's not overpowering. This is a very well balanced beer that even some of my Silver Bullet and Corona drinking friends will finish. Possibly the best American Pale Ale (Great Lakes Burning River is close). Get some soon.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Jon,4.42,"The beer that essentially led me here. SNPA is perhaps my all-time favorite old standby, and for good reason... I just don't know why it's taken me so long to review it. The pour is a light copper with a nice sized bubbly off-white head. The smell is great and features lots of hops, citrus and some yeasty notes. The taste is huge on the hops at first, especially for an APA. This beer is fairly carbonated for the style, and it shows in the mouthfeel, which is rather prickly. To me, this is a very easy drinker and is the trendsetter in the APA style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,zakery,4.33,"Pours a clear golden color with a white fluffy head with medium sized bubbles. Laces down the glass.  The smell is hoppy, obviously, with a fresh citrus coming through the most. There is also a faint yeast smell lingering in the background.  It has a medium body with surprisingly high carbonation for the style. The hops hit you first and stay till the end. It is very fresh tasting with appetizing and slightly bitter citrus flavors. The cascade hops not being overly bitter leaves an opening for the malt to come through as well, and it is a balanced beer.  Very appetizing and drinkable. If you're planning to have more than one, be prepared to have food ready because your taste-buds and stomach will be turned on by this beer.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Pegasus,4,"Light golden amber color with a thick and dense head that a pint glass will barely contain. The substantial remnants of the head linger to the bootom of the glass; lots of stickly lace, good carbonation. Strong aroma of grapefruit rind as well as hints of sweet malt. Begins with sweet malty flavors which are soon overlaid by sharp grapefruit flavors from the hops, finishes with slightly oily hop bitterness, excellent mouthfeel. A superb pale ale, nothing less.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,theman336,4.4,"I'd never had this until recently, when a six pack was given to me as a gift. I wil forever be greatfull to Tess, as her present turned me on to a top quality brew. The hops jump in from the get go and don't leave until the bottle is empty. There is less sweetness than you expect, but there are hints of it which help to balance out the bitterness of the hops, which is definately present from the beginning of the sip until the beer is swalowed. The hops aren't overpowering, just up front and even. It's beer the way it was meant to be. Absolutely fantastic stuff.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Todd,4.3,"Bright, clear golden amber with a healthy looking head that settles into a lasting white lace.  Biscuit, grain and loads of spicy hops in the nose with a dose of floral / citrus. Esters. Touch of earthy leaf.  Smooth, even mouthfeel. Body is medium. Sharp, tangy, fruity, citrus bitterness starts things off ... with rind, salt and a leafy feel on the palate -- near puckering. Lightly floral and spicy. Some mineral flavours. A malty dextrin flavour hides behind the hops, acting as its backbone and providing a bit of needed balance. Hop oils cling to the palate and merge with a bready/biscuity flavour in the finish.  One of the quintessential American Pale Ales. Simply a classic among American beers.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,doho95fu,4.43,"This is the beer I drink most consistently and that is due to its own consistency. Sierra is always good - never had a bad bottle. The appearance in amber and clear, the smell is good but doesn't really hit me with anything. The taste is great, with the right amount of hoppiness, doesn't blow you out with hops. Nice head and lacing.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,BeerManDan,3.92,"So much better than ""on-tap"". Not as bitter in the aftertaste and while drinking it. Although the flavor is not as intense as ""on-tap"". With the bottle, it has a balance flavor without the big bite!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,shirfan,4.1,"Dark golden color, long-lasting and just slightly off-white head. Above average lacing. A touch of yeast clouds the glass when swirled and poured into a pint glass once the head recedes far enough.  Malty sweet, but balanced by the grapefruit zing of Cascade hops. Not as bitter as other APA's I've tasted.  Very drinkable, the hoppy but fairly sweet taste and classic ale mouthfeel bring the bottom of the glass all too quickly.  Although I'll remain a Saranac Pale Ale customer due to significantly lower price, this beer was exceedingly good for the style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,zerk,4.03,"The beer that created the APA style. Hazy peach color with a persistant lace, slightly sweet cascade hop aroma, and a crisp sweet / bitter balance.

140,276,Skywave,4.24,"Everyone's ""benchmark"" American pale ale is well deserving of its reputation.

If you can make a beer this good, then you are doing just fine.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Lupe,4.3,"Deep clear amber color, large light beige head, and wonerful lace down the entire glass. Malts and hop floral scents dominate. Start is malt sweet, the middle moderate as with the carbonation, just the right amount of bite leading to a spectacular finish which is clean, crisp, dry. An excellent brew.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,cokes,3.29,"Obviously, an archetype for most APA's. Pours a yeast-filled golden amber. Thinnish white head with some stick. Nose is inviting with floral and citric notes. Malt is noticed with some faintly carmel/bready aromas. Hops jump forward in the taste dept. But not in a huge way. Maltiness provides some support by adding bready and biscuity hues along with some faint nondescript sweetness. Yeast pops ups here and there with some unwelcome mustiness. Decent in the mouth. Creamy, and smooth. Medium bodied. A good standby, as it is available almost everywhere. But there are much better APAs out there.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,IrishRedRock,3.97,"I expected this to be extremely hoppy from some of the reviews I read, but found it to be less hoppy than many other brews.

A quality beer, and for some odd reason I like the bottle.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Wildman,3.88,"This beer poured a golden amber color and formed a small white head that didn't hold and left little lace. Some carbonation present. If had an aroma of hops with a slight bit of citrus. The flavor was of hops with some malt. A bit of citrus aspect. The finish was slightly sweet/citrus with a bit of a bite.

Beautiful yellow amber, with ample hop head (ha! ha! get it?). Scent of hops is obvious, but also a prevailing lager-sulphur snort (could be the hops) pervades.

Pours a golden amber from a 12oz bottle. Carbonation is fair, and leaves one to wonder what it would be like if the cap weren't a twist off.  The next time I drink this Beer, Im going to do a roast duck with an orange sauce, the two should pair up eminently.

A fantastic, sticky, chunky, creamy head that keeps full coverage the whole way through while leaving rings in its wake. Scents have heavy hops and fruits, a pleaseantly soft mixture. My palate held a perfectly balanced malt base with a less bitter, more complex hop profile. A fantastic, velvety smooth, medium body. This brew drinks the best so far!

Pours nicely into the glass with a tight white head, with a golden color after things settle down. Nose is a bit yeast/fruity, with mellow hoppiness detected. Taste is sweetly malty, fruity with oh-so-sublte Cascade hops leaving their mark.

Bracing floral and citric hop nose. Plenty of malt backbone to hang the hops on. This beer has balance, though it definitely leans to the hop side. Some grapefruit, but not enough for puckering. A beer I could (and have) drank all night. Not an example of an American Pale Ale, but the beer which defined the style. We must be careful not to take a craft brew cornerstone like this for granted.

Perfect hoppy smell matched with the fruit and florals. The taste is maybe on the hop side for some, but I find it perfectly balanced, flavorful, and refreshing. SN always produces a quality product, and this one is readily available. This matches well with all foods, and I recommend it to newbies like me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,psugrad98,4.1,"Light golden orance in color with a hint of cloudiness. Smells like orange blossoms and somewhat fruity. Slightly hoppy with a nice malt sweetness, kinda has a fruit taste to it. Very refreshing.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Suds,4.35,"This is a resolutely enjoyable beer. Appears as a very pale, clear, burnt-golden color with small wisps of yeast swirling beneath the head. Crisp hops aroma and bitterness. This beer deserves praise as an example of rock-solid craft brewing consistency.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,jackndan,3.6,"Sierra Pale Ale: Good looking beer, cloudy caramel, had a big white head that disappeared in a few minutes. Wonderful aroma, sweet, with a little hoppiness. Hits the tongue with a little sweetness, and then a nice bitter hop bite. Several sips later, it seems the hops dominate. I can tell this is a fine beer, but the bitterness is a touch to much for me.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,John1985,4.26,"Beautiful gold color, fresh hop taste, malt tries a bit in the middle but gives up to the hops for the finish. Very refreshing and unique. As the beer warms the malt does come out a bit more to make the beer balanced. A take-no-prisioner pale ale!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,packetknife,3.25,I grabbed this with huge expectations. I heard all this wonderful stuff but I was sorely dissapointed. It doesn't have a lot of character. It's rather run-of-the-mill. The exception being it didn't leave any aftertaste so it was readily drinkable with a meal. I feel like I should be at a farm when I have any pale.,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,jtw5877,4.4,"Pours a nice amber color with a decent head, hops are in your face. This is the beer that got me into hoppy pale ales, I love it, and it is readily available in my area. What else can I say... A real good beer to convert your macro friends.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,mickeymac,4.42,"SN Pale Ale is an American classic: full of hops and topped with a beautiful white head. Out here on the west coast, it can be found in just about any drinking establishment, even those that stock primarily macrobrewed lagers. I've never had a bad one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,jonnylieberman,4.45,"This beer is a staple. Bread, water, salt, butter and Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Nothing wrong with this beer at all.  I can drink it all day and all night and sometimes do.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Murph,4.15,"This has to be one of the best examples of an American Pale Ale out there. Pours a nice orangey-gold with a nice creamy head. Smell is nice citrusy/floral hops from the cascades. Huge cascade hop flavor that is nicely balanced by some malt. The malt is not strong enough to really be perceptable but it prevents the beer from getting out of balance. A nice crisp and clean mouthfeel and the beer is highly drinkable. As I said before, almost a perfect example of an APA. Highly recommended to all.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,frank4sail,4.69,"12 Fl Oz Bottle. Golden color with a slight tint of amber. Not huge head retention but, a constantly laced glass. The smell of hop mflowers fill your head. Thick malty mouth feel and taste followed by hoppy bitterness. The finish mellows into a grassy/flowery/malty feeling of taste bud satisfaction. I can't think of a better mass produced American macro-brew product.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,marc77,4,"The thick, almost rocky, ivory - white head is well retained. It sits atop a very clear darker golden bubbly brew. Although the (ubiquitous in APAs) citrusy Cascade nose dominates the aroma, it is actually quite soft and pleasant. Not at all grapefruity, the Cascade hop nose is very appealing and clean. I've noticed dry hopping with Cascades leaves that ""grapefruity"" flavor/ aroma; Sierra Nevada uses a lot of late addition hops for aroma in their PA and doesn't dry hop. This brew is clean and well balanced all around. The assertive and clean hop bitterness dominates, but a firm maltiness manages to provide an adequate foundation for the hops. Yes. This is is the defining example for the style, although it's much better on tap.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,aracauna,3.35,"It's a beer. Typical smell, bitter hop flavor. Not bad for the style. Unfortunately, I'm just not a big fan of the style.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,mmthompson33,4.03,"This beer has established itself as a 'staple beer' of those in America who take their beers at least a little bit seriously. It's right up there with Anchor Steam, although they taste quite different. Definitely a bitter hoppy beer. When I started moving past Bud Light, this was the beer that tempted me away.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,budgood1,4.08,cloudy orange/golden color with little yeasties floating around. pours a thin head which sticks to the glass the whole way down. smells of those cascade hops....citrusy and moderately pungent. mouthfeel is fuller than expected and tastes wonderful. bitter hops and slightly bready with a bitter aftertaste. more depth than i was expecting too. very tasty!,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,bmills1608,4.22,"Very light copper with hints of gold.  Hop citrus nose up front. Taste is lemon/grapefruit; slight floral spice. Malt dryness kicks in at the finish.  This is a super-solid beer, plenty of complexity, easy to drink. Doesn't make the mistake that too many American Pales do by relying way too much on hops and hops only.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,WilliamPhilaPa,4.22,"The color is a pale gold with a frothy white head that diminishes rather quickly. Very hoppy ( not as much as Hopdevil which I also had ) , citrus, light sweetness, yeasty aroma. Flavor is citrus up front as well as bitterness, very hoppy, and moderately acidic.Finishes dry and bitter. Not as smooth as I would have liked but still a great brew!",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,pbrian,4.4,"Revolutionary. Second to Sam Adams in availablity, second to none in quality. The definition of fall-back beer. Went perfectly with the slice of pizza I just had for lunch.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,ThreePistols,3.15,"Pale golden color, frothy white head that diminishes fairly quick. Hoppy, citrus, slightly sweet, some floral tones, yeasty, aroma. Flavor is citrus, bitter, hoppy, slightly yeasty and moderately acidic. Finish is bitter and slightly dry. Could have been balanced better. I would have like to have experienced more malt. Overall this is a good beer however it is not my style of beer. Too hoppy for my taste but I enjoyed it all the same.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,hooligan,3.64,"golden beer that foams to a thin lacy white head, no chill haze. Smells like citrus with a leaning towards grapefruit and faint elements of yeast. Clean crisp malt character and an aggressive floral hop taste upfront, with the malt dying down and the hops prevailing on the palate afterward. Slightly lacking in malt character in my opinion, which makes this beer slightly unbalanced with the hop bitterness and strong hop aroma.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,ADR,3.77,"To my tastes, over rated...amber color, nice floral scent and a floral hop finish...an expiration date would be nice, since I'm never sure how much yeast I should expect in the bottle and unless you really know the demographics of your liquor store, you don't know how fast it sells...OK, Sierra Nevada Pale is good and complete (doesn't lack in taste or complex mouthfeel) and many people's idea of a Pale, I just like ones that ends on a chewy, fruity note...",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Bierman9,3.53,"Considering what I had heard/read about SNPA, I was a bit dissapointed by my glass of SNPA (on tap). Clear, medium copper color, with a small fine head. Bitter hoppy nose. Medium-rough on the tongue, with medium body, at best. I tasted lotsa hops, but more on the bitter side....not smooth enough for me. Was it even a bit citrusy, or sour? I could drink a few, but not as good as expected.... may have to try the bottle-version of this and re-review....we'll see...  overall: 3.6 appearance: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | mouthfeel: 3.5 | drinkability: 3.5  42",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,mophie,4,"Like many others, I'm sure, this was the first Sierra Nevada I ever had, so there will always be a special place in my heart (and my fridge) for this fine brew. A great intro for those who are just getting into micros.  And by the way, this is one beer I recommend in a bottle rather than on tap.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,jermar,4.82,My steady bitter companion. Very consistent and reasonably priced for such a classic. I love the yeast sediment and floral hoppiness!,Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,proc,4,"The gold standard for widely available American brews. This is the beer, after Sam Adams, that get many people to explore ""better beers"" and to educate the beer drinker as to what a hop is acutally supposed to be used for. Pours out to a nice, amber color in the glass with a decent head. Aroma is that of slight spice, malt and light hops. The malt to hop balance is incredible for a beer of this style and makes for a very tasty beer that isn't overhopped as many of the style are. Starts somewhat malty and finishes with a wondeful taste of hops. Sierra Nevada is an excellent brewer. The Pale Ale is a champ and a staple of my 'fridge.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,geckointhebox,4.76,"What is to say?!? The more I write the more I want to run to fridge to get another (just to make sure I am reviewing it properly). If you like ales, this is a fine one.",Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,"California, United States",American Pale Ale,90
140,276,Jordan,4.66,"Mildly sweet at start strong hops bitterness finish, enough malt keeps it creamy. Grapefruit-like aftertaste lingers, does not turn me off. Smells like the outdoors.
