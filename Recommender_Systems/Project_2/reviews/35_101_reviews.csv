35,101,Sigmund,2.94,"355 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 5.5%. Chestnut-coloured beer, moderate off-white head. The aroma has some caramel, dust and grass. Fizzy mouthfeel. The flavour has plenty of caramel but is not too sweet, also notes of brown bread, the spice addition (cinnamon, ginger, orange peel) is fairly moderate and quite mild. The bitterness is low. Certainly drinkable, but not really great.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,RyanK252,3.77,"Bottle poured into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass  A: Pours copper amber with a frothy light khaki head that settles to a thin layer and leaves a little light lacing.  S: Toasty, bready, solid hit of spice, dark fruit, slightly earthy, and some toffee sweetness.  T: Follows the nose, leads with big toasty bready malt, spice comes right out, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg, orange peel is more subtle, dark fruit, plum and fig, a bit earthy, rounded out with toffee sweetness.  M: On the fuller side of medium body, moderate carbonation, slight creaminess. More body than you'd expect for a 5.6% lager.  O: It's been quite a while since I've had this one. I can understand some people not being super into how heavily spiced it is, but on a cold festive night it hits the spot.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

35,101,blazerkor,3.34,"So they say they brewed this one with cinnamon, ginger and orange peel... I'm not getting any of that in the smell. Just bready malts and that's it.  It tastes like it smells. It's so much like their Boston Lager but maybe a little brighter. So really really malty with a little hops coming in late.  It's not too thin and it's smooth with sudsy carbonation. There is a small bight of bitterness on the finish but it's gone quickly.  Pretty basic, it definitely doesn't live up to the complex flavors the label promises. I'll give it a 3.5 out of 6.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,1009,3.74,"I've been reading Jim Koch's book lately, so I was craving a good ol' Sam Adams and found this in my fridge. They claim this is a newer/improved version of the classic brew, but honestly still just as satisfied with it as I was last Winter. It pours into a nice amber/caramel like color with a foamy white head. The beer gives off malty and toasted aromas as you lift to your nose. The taste that follows gives hints of caramel, maltiness, and slight cinnamon and nutmeg notes. Very nice traditional Christmas holiday tastes. A very smooth beer, not overly carbonated. A wonderful treat for the holiday season!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,jwp777,4.09,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle:  Pours a clear, semi-dark amber color. Head is off white and bubbly but the bubbles are small and quite dense. Starts about 3/4 inch thick and retains well. No lacing.  Smell is probably my favorite part of this beer (that’s rare). Instant waves of toasty malts, freshly baked bread, cinnamon, and a sharpness from the ginger. I get just enough orange peel to balance, but not til the end.  Taste more or less follows the nose. Finish is toasty and medium length.  Mouthfeel is fairly light, but not watery. Carbonation is fairly low, but it still manages to be a bit crisp. Very clean throughout. It’s like eating perfectly baked wheat bread that’s just out of the oven. I could probably drink it in warm weather too but it’s exactly what I need to combat the bitter Oklahoma cold.  Overall - my favorite Sam Adams brew and, for me, a good representation of the style.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Shelbs90,3.88,smells toasty. very amber looking. it tastes very good. i really love this beer. smooth and nutty taste. not very carbonated which is nice. can’t taste ginger but can taste the citrus. could be a summer beer as well,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,TheBricenator,4,"Look: Nearly clear amber in color with a dense off-white head that settles to a lid, leaving great lacing as it recedes Aroma: Warm bread, orange peel, ginger root, a little toffee, wafts of cinnamon, and some dried dark fruits Taste: Rich and deep bready malt, toffee, and dark fruits come on first and joined shortly after by orange, ginger, and cinnamon. The spices along with bready malt are prominent in the middle and closes soft and clean with orange peel notes showing up again Mouthfeel: Full, clean throughout, medium-high carbonation, and a soft and clean finish Overall: Tasty stuff here. A delicious and well-made spiced bock and one of my favorite winter seasonal beers throughout the years. I didn’t realize until I saw the bottle that its recipe had been tweaked and I’d love to do a blind side-by-side between the old and new one but no biggie, this is very good regardless",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Iamaskier,3.31,"Pours with good carbonation but surprisingly poor head. Smell is light and sweet, hints of orange. Taste begins with a mild caramel malt and turns to a slight hoppy orange peel that lingers. Overall a decent dinner beer that I’d put above a blue moon and below a fat tire.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,MonDak_Joe1953,3.57,"12oz bottle. Label is notched for best by APR (2021). This is the 2020 release. Deep amber colored body. Clear. Half a finger of off white head just stays there. Strings and spots of lacing stay on the sipping side after each sip. Aroma of light roasted malt, with an accent from the orange peel. Spices are not expressive. Taste is of a rich lager malt, with orange. The cinnamon and ginger make a brief appearance at the end of each sip. Slightly heavy mouth feel, with a smooth, creamy touch. Very good carbonation. A comfortable beer to drink, and reminds one of the spices of the holidays. Less expressive than some of the other holiday beer releases. Beautiful look in the glass.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,odannyob,3.47,"Pretty flavorful on a quiet, sunny, mid-November, late morning taste test, from a cold glass bottle to a 12 oz. clear glass tumbler to my curious taste buds. Yup. Not bad, a'tall. Not 100% sure, so think I'll have another, just so I can be accurate w/my assessment. Has a very smooth warmth to it, too.

35,101,ATL6245,3.99,"Reformulated 2020 version  Appearance: Clear amber, off white head with good retention. Slow rising bubbles  Aroma: Caramel and toasted malt.  Flavor & Aftertaste: Caramel and toasted malt notes. Cinnamon spices noticeable. Orange peel a little hidden. Sweet malt backbone. Restrained bitterness.  Mouth-feel: Full bodied, smooth and well rounded. Low carbonation. Nice long finish with spiciness lingering.  Overall: I loved the 2019 version, so I was afraid they might screw this up. It's just as good. Drinks nice & smooth. spices compliment the malt & hops. Not bitter. I really like the crisp finish with the spiciness lingering well after the malt & hops. It a solid choice if you are not sure what to take to a Holiday party or just want something to enjoy that has low alcohol on cold winter nights. A big, bold Imperial Stout is not always preferred.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Danzifer,3.67,"They claimed to have improved the recipe so let's give it a try. I remember it was already good previously.  It's deep reddish amber, fizzy, decent head. Smells of roasted malt with a hint of citrus. Tastes predominantly of sweet spices followed by a huge malty backbone. Delicious. Mouthfeel is a little on the thick side. Overall, a good beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Been drinking this one for over a decade and hasn’t changed but marginally thru the years  Spices are my fave part of this brew as the alcohol seem non existent so very drinkable,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

A bit past the best by date but still a decent beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,mlepizzera,3.48,"Very solid beer. I am an amateur when it comes to the knowledge of a great beer, but regarding the limited range of my tastebuds, this is a hoppy and smooth drink. The more I drink this beer the more I enjoy it. I am about a quarter done with this 12 pack and after 3 of these I can honestly say I would recommend this beer. Very drinkable, not too heavy on the hops so not too bitter but just enough to make a novice like me impressed. Cheers",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Not a great pair with turkey or ham. But something to drink while your waiting. When pairing it with fish, or chicken, it was not a great accompaniment.

35,101,Kenny_Gage2,3.8,"From a 12oz bottle: Pours a dark amber/copper color with about a 1-2 finger caramel head and has a good amount of lacing. This is a beer that definitely follows your nose. A Sweet malty/bready forward taste is followed by a bit of spice from the cinnamon, and a perfect amount of bitterness from the hops. Every sip yields a slight warming sensation inside. Overall a great beer, tasty and pleasing to the senses. Labeled as a Winter Lager, personally I think this beer is a great drink for any season, be it winter, spring, summer, or fall and it pairs well with many foods.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

35,101,NickSMpls,3.81,"A pretty beer, clear dark amber with a two-finger head with sticking lacing. Definite malt nose and the spice notes are pleasant. Taste is malt forward, with bready finish. Very clean taste, just enough bitterness to balance a bit of sweetness. We have not had this in a long time (5+ years at least) but thought to revisit it. We'll sek out a sixer or two every winter as we like a lager break from all those Holiday Ales.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Harrison8,3.84,"Pours a translucent amber with a finger of khaki foam on top that retains well. Aroma is caramely, toasty, bready, nutty malts with hints of cinnamon, nutmeg and other spices. Spices add a little more zest and pop to the flavor profile, which carries the same caramely, toasty, bready, nutty malts forward. Mouth feel is lightly creamy, with a bit of a sharp crispness on the back of the tongue. Thickness is medium-thin.

I know it's more on the commercial side i would guess , but Sam Adams hasn't disappointed at all in my 47 years. Not really too much of a difference in taste and or smell from bottle to keg , and with that , i know the product is consistent. Some beers seem to lose something in transition between the 2 , but this one doesn't.

35,101,Bsimpson91,4.65,"Subtle Spice, deep Maltiness. New 2019. Starting With the looks. Poured into my favorite tulip glass, Results in a beautiful deep amber tone with reddish orange highlights. A few soda bubbles around the side and some very small champagne bubbles make there way to the top. The cap is nice, off colored white that sticks around for a while. lacing is there but doesn't stay around. Moving along to Smell. What can I say, It smells just like any ol' Dark Lager. the aroma is a fresh bold Malt that invites you to take a sip. Moving along the flavor. The one and only spice that hits me is the Cinnamon. The Cinnamon really hits you with its heat and a subtle aromatic quality. Ginger may be present, but its subdued. The flavor progresses into a deep , pleasant Maltiness. Much depth like any Oktoberfest or Bock, the flavor is welcoming and hugs your taste buds. The finish is simple and somewhat dry. Clean flavor throughout the beer. Now for feel. Very similar to any dark German Lager, It's a tad thin. It stays true to its style. Carbonation is medium. Not really creamy or silky, which is a let down for me. Overall A Festive enjoyable Beer, I would only buy on such a occasion.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

35,101,WilliamGustin,3.31,"Alright - this is one of those ‘it depends’ beers. Great deep copper, molasses color and pours with a brief head. Nice mouth feel with a good swallow. LET IT WARM UP A BIT is my best advice. Doesn’t do much when super cold, but a nice bread malt aroma...maybe a touch of spice is in there if you give it a chance. Not over the top and a reasonable bock buuuut a touch of hops may set some people off. I like this beer with dinner when I’m out eating warm, winter comfort food. Not a 4-5 range beer to buy to take home but a nice beverage on a cold night out.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Historiker,2.74,"Very pretty copper color with no head to speak of. Smell was disappointing. Maybe toast if I use my imagination...maybe. The first thing I tasted was hops. And if you like hops, that's great. But I don't love them, and Sam Adams said ""complimented by hops,"" which was inaccurate in my opinion. Taste was similar to the smell - burnt toast, and something reminiscent of banana bread. The ""Cinnamon, ginger and orange peel"" were 100% undetectable. Mouthfeel was medium. This wasn't a Christmas beer. It was just a beer, and not a very good one at that. Move along, folks. Nothing to see here.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Taste is toasted dark bread, a hint of toffee and or coffee, semisweet or semi dry, depending on how you look at it. There is a noticeable amount of hops, decent amount of bittering on the back end. Mouthfeel is medium. Overall it’s a good Bock, I just can’t smell or taste any of the spices that are supposed to make it a “winter” beer. Maybe that’s a good thing. I couldn’t drink very many of these but one or two is ok.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

35,101,defunksta,3.97,"2020:  Appearance: Pours a deep amber color that is clear with a strong off-white head. SRM of 18. (4.25)  Aroma: Mild aromas of toasted brown bread, dark bananas & caramel, nuts, brown sugar. Roasted caramel notes. An underlying baked cherry underneath. (4.00)  Flavor: Mild flavor too with more toasted brown bread & cherries, oranges, with roasted caramel underneath. Sort of like the Boston lager, but seems to have more caramel, molasses, and cherry malt flavors with less spice. Finishes sweet, but with a roasted caramel roastiness. Leans sweet. (3.75)  Feel: Medium bodied. Low to medium carbonation. Finishes balanced, but leans sweet with a roastiness that lingers on the palate (3.50)  Compared to Schells Bock 11/20/20: Pours an identical color. Milder aromas/flavors. More toasty, cherry, and slightly darker. Less caramel and nuts. More roasty and less smooth.  Compared to Breckeridge Brewery's Christmas Ale 11/22/20: Pours a similar color. More toast, citrus hops, caramel on the aroma. Less molasses and malty. More complex. Overall, more complex flavors and spices with less unilateral maltiness of molasses. Winner: Sam Adams.  Compared to Sam Adams Oktoberfest 12/22/20: Pours a slightly darker and more ruby color. More generic brown and bock flavors? I don't know, it just has less here. Less caramel, toffee, red fruit, Munich malt. Milder overall. Different than I expected.  Compared to Sam Adams' Boston Lager 3/1/21: Much darker pour. More malty caramel, molasses on the aroma. Less cinnamon and that traditional grassy bread spice.  Overall: A little bit different and milder than I was expecting. Nonetheless, a great beer. I don't get as much cinnamon, ginger, orange peel on this one and the flavor is slightly muted. Yet the flavor profile is complex and reminiscent of Boston Lager with the roasted brown bread and nuts. Maybe slightly darker with more roast and cherry with slight orange. Not much banana this year as last. More muted overall. Less spice too. Mostly just brown bread, caramel, and nuts. . Yet, it's quite a good bock and I'll have to try it a few more times this year.

Clear beyond the darkness. A nice tan and clingy head. SRM of 21. (4.00)  Aroma: Strong aromas of citrus, banana, and spices. There is nutmeg and clove. A bready malt with a strong banana profile. (4.25  Flavor: Flavor follows the nose with more citrus and bready spice. Lots of clove, nutmeg, and all-spice. Not getting a whole lot of cinnamon, but maybe a touch. Then a citrus and strong creamy bread sweetness underneath to allows it to finish sweet. (4.00)  Feel: Medium to lighter weight, yet has a full bready body.. Excellent carbonation. Leaves a cream sugar sweetness on the palate that is pleasant. (4.00)   Overall: An complex and delicious beer. An interestingly strong banana flavor. Nice nutmeg and clove spices. Lots of cream and bread. Finishes sweet, which often turns me off, but this was pleasant. The sweetness is attenuated and appropriate. The body is light enough to finish clean too.

A super nice mid brownish almost copper color with a nice small off white head. Decent amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. Really digging the copper color of this brew. The smell is rich with roasted grains and malts. Then a nice mix of citrus with spices. You mostly pick up on cinnamon an ginger.

You first pick up the light roasted grains and malts, then a mild amount of spices. The spices are a nice touch to this brew. This brew has a super nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering about this brew. This brew would go nice with dinner or on a cold winter day. The body of this German Bock is a solid medium. The mouth feel is Bold, Spices, Rich , Clean Smooth and Refreshing. Overall I am going to give Samuel Adams Winter Lager a 4.25 out of 5.

Plus, it was a good lighter abv option to go with watching the game.  This beer pours a reddish brown hue and is clear with light carbonation visible. The head is off white and creamy, dissipating very slowly to a rocky layer with a neck. 4.25/5 The aroma is very sweet and fruity with notes of plums, ages, red wine grapes, and dark cherries. It comes across a bit syrupy and almost like cough medicine. 3.5/5 The flavor has that same sweetness and fruitiness, but luckily does not come off as cough syrup. Notes of plums, red wine grapes, dark cherries, and dates kick things off before transitioning to wheat bread and then finally to floral hops that feature very little in the way of bitterness. The bitterness is light enough that it does not linger after swallowing. 3.75/5 This beer is quite wet but not coating and it is medium bodied. There is very little carbonation and no dryness or lingering dryness. It is smooth and syrupy, but also thirst quenching at the same time (generally not two terms that go together). 4/5 This is a very good beer, although it is quite unbalanced in favor of fruity sweetness.

Better out of the bottle than on tap in my experience, it's nothing to write home about necessarily, but a solid brew to keep around for cold-weather sessions. It is a shame that this one isn't around a little later before it gets replaced by Cold Snap, the taste of which does not seem quite as appropriate for the depths of winter.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Not too bad.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,1000lbgrizzly,3.52,"Deep mahogany/ruby body, clear with fine updrafts of bubbles. A small coarse head appears on the pour but immediately disappears; between that and the color this now looks like a Flanders red. Still beautiful. There's pungent toasty bread crust and caramel on the nose, a bit of raisin, and a hint of citrus and cinnamon in the background. If the malt wasn't so 'raw' smelling this would be awesome, but as is it seems a bit unrefined. The orange flavor gets more potent on the tongue, yet still melds nicely with the malts which now seem more like a beer's should, instead of bread crust. No sign of the spices here, however. Finish is actually bitter, like black tea. Body is light, nearly like water, with assertive but fine carbonation. The orange peel was a star both aromatically and gustatorily, delicious in its own right and played well off the malts. The rest was just trying to keep up; the malt, which as I understand it is supposed to be the focal point and thus delicious in this style, were ho-hum, even seeming amateurish, as if it was untransformed from the raw grains. It wasn't warming like a winter beer should be (in my book), yet it wasn't refreshing either.

Once swallowed you are left with a lingering roasted grain flavor that is lightly sweet with hints of the orange peel and spice. F: medium to low carbonation that softly foams giving a creamy fuller feel. Overall, I really like this but I like malt and wheat beers.

A: Pours a deep amber. Little head on this one. What head there is is a foamy white. Medium carbonation.  S: Malts initially. Some caramel. Fairly mute, I would say.  T: As remembered, the orange peel is prominent. Some hops as well. Caramel later on. A little cinnamon somewhere in there.  M: Medium-bodied. Slight dryness.  O: My favorite winter beer, hands down. Takes some of the best traits from each of the various winter seasonals that I have tried over the years for an excellent product. Warm flavors without losing the hop bite. Will be picking up some more (and more and more).  Sam should consider keeping this on the shelves through February.

35,101,BloodSoakedAleMug,3.98,"Sam Adams is okay, but I don't really get my hopes up with their seasonal offerings. To my surprise, this one was pretty well made.  Look: Pours a light toasted brown hue with a quarter finger, off white head that leaves no lacing on the glass.  Aroma: Gently toasted, creamy wheat smell upfront. Rich aromas of caramel. In the background notes of cinnamon and mild ginger, candied cherries and burnt orange peel.  Taste: Crisp with clean notes of slightly burnt caramel and mild chocolate. Very rich and wheaty with notes of frosting and vanilla. Restrained flavors of christmas spices like smoky orange peel, cinnamon, thyme and even ginger follow suit. Slightly floral and yeasty, very clean tasting. Midpalate; notes of candy apples and bananas. Finishes dry on more flavors of toasted caramel and creamy wheat.  Feel: Body is slightly watery and bubbly but it works. Thirst quenching, yet dry. Malty, but balanced by notes of holiday spice and bitter floral hops.  Overall: I'd recommend this, just make sure you're buying it fresh, as this being a malt forward, lightly hopped beer - won't hold up that well over time as the flavor will fade.  If you're looking for a lightly spiced, malty, thirst quenching beer, this one is worth trying - but I doubt hardcore fans of bocks or holiday beer in general will fall head over heels for this.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Not a strong aroma but a pleasant one.  Taste is a good rendition of roasted malt without the underlying bitterness that sometimes accompany that grain bill. The spices, orange peel, cinnamon and ginger, come off more like a dusting on top of the cake rather than in the body. Good medium level blend of complex flavors that harmonize beautifully. Hops are in there but they are singing along with the rest of the voices and contribute rather than stand out. Finish is quick with just a bit of rich malt in the aftertaste.  Texture is medium, which is to say there is a sense of fullness without being in any way heavy.  I suppose I could call this a festive beer what with the spices and all, but it doesn't actually wander too far off the dark lager homestead. It's just a good, solid, well made dark lager that I could serve guests anytime of the year.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Second, only 1 of Boston Beer's 4 bocks are among the Top 100 bocks rated for quality.  And a third point which is IMHO.... This is a much better bock than its ratings indicate.

LOOK: Pours with 3 fingers of khaki foam that dissipates into 2 fingers worth within 3 and a half minutes. Copper in color. There is a plethora of small rising bubbles that explains why the foam head refuses to die all the way. Lacing is thick and moderate in quantity. SMELL: Mild aromas of cinnamon, ginger, caramel, sweet bread, figs, and plums entangle with subtle aromas of orange peel, spicy hops, and earthy hops along with hints of pale malts. TASTE: Mild wheat (suddenly appear!), pale malt, and caramel flavors enter initially and are immediately followed by mild cinnamon and ginger flavors. Mild orange peel flavors arrive next onto the palate as pale malt flavors grow stronger. Mild sweet bread flavors, subtle spicy and earthy hop flavors, and hints of figs and plums enter lastly as all previous flavors push on. FEEL: Full-bodied and subtly carbonated. Goes down smooth and creamy. Finishes very crisp. NOTE: A good beer by the Boston Beer Company. This was nothing mind-blowing, but it is easily likable.

35,101,ThisWangsChung,3.53,"Re-review.  Pours a beautiful copper color. The head is two fingers high and off-white in shade. This beer's head really leaves behind a ton of lacing on the glass, though its retention isn't amazing.  Almost immediately, cinnamon and ginger invade my nostrils. You know, as much as people say Hardywood GBS invokes gingerbread - this does that very same thing nearly as well. Also adding to the experience are touches of wheat and apricot (though I don't get much orange peel here). This offers a very intriguing aroma, spiced in all the right ways.  As it washes over the palate, I initially pick up flavors of ginger, molasses, and wheat. Orange peel rounds out the mid-taste, with a nice kick of cinnamon finishing things off. It's not a particularly deep beer, but it balances all its elements extremely well.  Creamy and soft textured, this just feels rich - not just for a 5.6% lager, but in general. The finish is dry, keeping it an easy drinker. Carbonation is gentle, and this seemingly aids this beer's substantial body.  I've always felt Sam Adams do lagers better than ales. The standard Boston Lager is still quite tasty, Double Agent is probably their best hoppy offering, and Noble Pils is tragically missed (or is it - hi Spring pack!) This reaffirms that belief. It's not comically cinnamon-heavy like so many Winter warmer-cum-pumpkin ale offerings, nor is it some dinky, watery weakling in terms of mouthfeel. This is a perfect ""please the masses"" kind of beer that works great for parties or guzzling by the pitcher.  3.53/5: A worthy offering that I overlook too often in the winter",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

35,101,WayneEsten,4.1,"The bottle had an ""enjoy before date"" of April 2016 and came from a 12 pack.  Into a Riedel Ouverture beer glass it poured dark amber with a hint of ruby. The head was light tan and about an inch and a half high. It's a very attractive winter lager.  I could smell the malt and caramel as others have noted, but I also detected a very faint trace of the orange peel.  The taste was malty and a bit sweet, but not overly so. I've had four of these over the last couple of days and on a couple of occasions the orange came through clearly. It was probably because I let those bottles warm up a bit longer when I set them out of the refrigerator before pouring. This beer fills the mouth, not like a stout, of course, but more than most lagers I've had. The carbonation is mild and the finish is very, very smooth. Earlier today I had a bottle with fresh ground peanut butter spread on a hot thick piece of wheat toast. Wow, what a combination. My new winter treat.  Overall, I really like this beer. I've always thought Sam Adams Boston Lager was well made, just not for me. I like my beers a bit darker. This one is just right for me. Given that it's a seasonal beer and only shipped in November and December, I'm stocking up on 12 packs to hold me until early spring.  UPDATE/EDIT 1/4/16: This was my ""go to"" beer this past December so I've had over 24 bottles of it. I reduced my rating for LOOK, TASTE and OVERALL from 4.5 to 4.25. This beer is so much better when it is removed from the refrigerator 15 to 20 minutes before it is popped and poured. I still really like it.  UPDATE/EDIT 5/14/16: Well I finished all the SA Winter Lager I had stashed away about two weeks ago. I reduced my final rating for LOOK, FEEL and OVERALL from 4.25 to 4.00.

35,101,Pantalones,3.47,"Written from notes taken last night, as I don't currently have a working computer. 5th bottle from the six-pack; best-by date is April 2016.  Looks very nice -- dark red-brown color, very clear with lots of bubbles rising from the bottom (they're easy to see with the help of a flashlight, but still barely visible without.) Nice layer of light tan foam on top, leaving a good amount of traces behind on the glass as it starts to shrink down. Never fully vanished in the time it took me to drink the whole glass, though it did get down to a thin coating on top after a while.  Smell initially comes across as mostly a darkish ""beery"" smell, just a bit of a caramel-y sweetness in there too. Taking further sniffs as the foam shrinks down, more sweetness and maybe some cinnamon(?) start to pop in. There's a bit of something else in there I can't quite identify, too.  Taste is pretty mild at first, but I found myself liking it enough on the first sip this time that the ""sip"" ended up being more like a gulp. Malt still seems to be the primary flavor -- the wheat is more noticeable taste-wise vs. smell, and there's a bit of a toasty thing on the end, too. Cinnamon (as in the smell) stands out more, but still very much secondary to the malt. There is an odd ""something"" in there that's not entirely pleasant, but I can't quite place what it is -- wasn't noticing it in the first half of the glass at all, oddly, but toward the end it's more noticeable. Would have rated a bit higher in this category had this ""something"" not started to come out so much toward the end.  Feel is fairly light for such a dark-colored beer, but not watery or overly fizzy at all -- substantial enough to feel ""beery"" but light enough to be quickly and easily drinkable. Does get a little pricklier later on, it seems, which is unfortunate considering how nice the initial mouthfeel was.  Overall, my opinion on this one has gotten a bit more positive toward the end of this six-pack. I may have gone in expecting more of a bock (heavier, stronger flavors, etc.) and also more on the ""winter spices"" end, but looking at it as more of a... well, ""winter lager,"" as the name suggests -- a slightly darker/heavier and slightly more Christmas-spiced version of a standard year-round sort of lager... it's not nearly as disappointing as I first thought. I doubt I'll buy a full six-pack of this one again, but when I get one of the winter variety packs I won't mind having a couple more of these.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

As other reviews have stated, I don't really notice any of the flavors advertised on the bottle, except perhaps just the slightest hint of orange zest. That said, there's plenty of flavor in this bock. A lot of malt but never overdone or too sweet, and as with many Sam Adams beers, balance is quite the main feat here. A bit of clove and banana bread, and a nice mix of textures which combines the clarity and light body of a lager with the slightly creamy head and gritty texture of a wheat.

35,101,teromous,3.62,"Appearance: Dark brown body with hints of red. Brilliantly clear body. Eggshell white head that is creamy and leaves good lacing on the glass. Good head retention.  Aroma: I smell lemons and there is a touch of a roasted flavor that I really have to bury my nose into the glass to pick out. Pretty faint aromas. Nothing really stands out here.  Taste: There is a really nice caramel sweetness with a hint of walnut flavor and toasted bread crust. The label says ""brewed with orange peel, cinnamon, and ginger"" and I don't pick up any of these flavors. It's a pretty decent bock but the sweetness is on the lower side. There is a slight tang on the aftertaste but it's indiscriminate flavor-wise.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is nice and smooth but it's a bit thinner that what I would expect out of a bock.  Overall: I'm picking up some lemon aroma on the nose...I don't know if this is from the orange peel or possibly the ginger but I don't think it adds much to this beer. I don't get any spices in the flavor of the beer but the overall flavor of the beer is really nice. It is like a bock that has a little less caramel flavor and a little more nuttiness. It is a bock that I would recommend but I would say not to expect the advertised spice.

35,101,Strat58cat,2.9,"This is another beer that starts Samuel Adams fans down the path of only drinking Boston Lager. Sure, it looks so good that you can almost taste your hopes for what it is. Plus, you've heard about how they add spices in this lager, and brew it up with a heavy malt, so that it's a true winter beer from the winter environs of Boston. It may be the first seasonal you drink from Samuel Adams, because of all the promised goodness. Then you drink it and it's like . . . wtf? Damn! I shoud've just had a Boston Lager.  This is another old-school, ""big"" beer from Samuel Adams, but by ""big"" they mean a big beery malt. Beery Malt? Really? It is extremely lightly hopped (22 ibu) compared to today's beers, or even the original Boston Lager. The spice that they talk about adding during brewing is barely detectable. After trying this one, nobody could blame you if you decided to drink only Boston Lager. However, they do make White Christmas, which is pretty good.  The look, as with many of the beers from Samuel Adams, shows their attention to quality ingredients. It's a deep copper color. The head foams up very abundantly and laces very abundantly. Looks good!  When you snuff in the aroma, however, you realize that something may be amiss. There's just not much to it. Forget about a powerful aroma of grapefruit, pine or any of the other hallmarks of a modern IPA - of course. Also forget about the ineffable scent of paradise that you get in a Boston Lager. It's basically just a meh smell of beery malt. There's a barely detectable hint of cinnamon spice in the mix, but it's about a 1 on a scale to 10. Uh, oh.  The taste confirms that damn! I should have just ordered a Boston Lager. It's malt. That's the flavor - beery malt. Now I'm not talking about a Lagunitas Sucks multi-layered, syrup-thick complex of flavor combining sweetness and spice. I'm talking about a powerfully beery malt. ""Beeaahh"" as a Beantown resident might say. Time has sort of passed by that so-so flavor. The spice is really not contributing much. It may smell great when they brew it, but it doesn't do much for me.  The feel is fine. It's not super-thick feeling, but far from watery. With the powerfully beery malt flavor, the consistency is pretty substantial. The carbonation seems medium.  Overall, time has passed by this approach to craft beer. Perhaps as a reaction to the watery beers of the giant brewers, Samuel Adams brewed a hugely beery-malt of a beery malt beery malt. Did I mention it tastes like beery malt?

I’m not getting much in the way of savory spices, but the beer finishes with some nicely balanced hoppy bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with some good carbonation to tickle the taste buds. With an ABV of 5.6%, there is no alcohol on the palate.  Overall: This is a good winter beer. Good balance between malt and sweet and hops. Very drinkable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

35,101,HoppyBastard,3.67,"Poured from a 12 ounce can into a Shaker pint glass, date on bottom of can is ""JUN 2015"".  APPEARANCE: pours a clear amber color with one-finger off-white head that dissipated slowly until a thin, almost unbroken layer of small bubbles remained, medium carbonation and some lacing was present on the glass.  SMELL: molasses, bread, spice, subtle to the nose.  TASTE: the taste is initially sweet molasses, this is a malt forward beer, next there is a mild hop bite with some spice, the last note is the orange citrus, there was a slight metallic taste that was not appealing to me.  PALATE: this beer has a smooth mouthfeel, medium carbonation and body.  OVERALL: this beer looked better than it tasted, it was good but not great, I would probably not seek this one out again as there are better options available, Sam Adams makes a lot of beers but many are underwhelming.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

35,101,PorterPro125,3.64,"Serving Type: 355 mL Bottle  A- Pours a deep reddish amber colour that is quite good looking. This is topped by about a finger width of dirty white head that quickly dissipates into a thin layer that lasts throughout the session. The head retention just plain sucks but other than that, Winter Lager is a great looking beer.  S- The aroma of this lager is fairly complex and I really dig it. Deep maltiness and a slight hop character that is finished off by cinnamon spice. Pleasant and inviting.  T- Identical to the smell but with the hops less pronounced. Well balanced and easily palatable.  M- Light to Medium body. Medium carbonation. Finish is fairly dry. Slightly astringent.  O- After only having access to Boston Lager and Latitude 48 IPA for the longest time, I have to say that I was a little excited when I saw Winter Lager on the shelf. Overall, Winter Lager is a beautiful beer that sports a strong malt backbone that is well complimented by a cinnamon-like spiciness. Easy to drink and quite tasteful.

35,101,PhilHeinricke,3.77,"I'm not a big Samuel Adams fan. Years ago when Coors was the best beer available, the addition of Samuel Adams Lager was like heaven, but now compared to IPAs and porters and microbreweries, Samuel Adams is just boring and unexciting.  My neighbor is a beer fanatic, and he has a keg in his man cave so when he invited us over for x-mas dinner, it was a no-brainer. The only problem is that he had just finished off a keg, and he hadn't replaced it so the only thing he had was this.  And I was pleasantly surprised.  This is good stuff. It's got a reddish hue to it with a head on top that you have to respect.

Taste: Much like the nose, the sweet notes from this bock are dominated by a weird farmy astringency. The bottle says there's spices in this but I can't pick up on any.

The taste pretty much followed suit but added a little extra with some nice spiciness. This was not overpowering it was just enough to keep it lively. Nothing to really hold my attention or make me yearn for another one. Overall it is a Sam Adams and usually they are all just average drinkable beers. I hate to say that because I have just moved from Vermont and love the New England Area beers but Sam Adams just seems to produce more average brews than strong ones and this beer, Winter Lager, just happens to be one of the average ones.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

35,101,JohnnyI,3.76,"Pours a nice copper color with bright amber highlights. Accentuated by a rocky, antique white head that dissipates quickly, leaving ample lacing on the glass. Nice clarity for such an amber beer. The aroma is fruity, mildly tart with a familiar lager scent, but does little to conjure the spirit of winter. The flavor follows the nose, finishing with some mellow spice and faint toasted grains. Without the hints of ginger and cinnamon, this would be quite pedestrian. Sam lists orange peel as a special ingredient, and might help explain the fruity tang that the beer conveys. The caramel malts and spices do mesh well with the Noble Hops, delivering a harmonious brew. Rather inoffensive and easy to drink. The mouthfeel is medium-thin, with effervescent carbonation that awakens the gentle flavors. Not as rich as my ideal bock, but tasty nonetheless. Like many Sam offerings, it's a nice gateway in to bigger, bolder things. I would certainly not turn my nose up at this beer if offered, but I'm unlikely to ever seek it out. Especially with so many other superior seasonal offerings widely distributed. Stock this at a holiday party and it's sure to be a hit with some casual beer drinkers.  Edit: I actually had a holiday party, and found that I ended up drinking a lot of these myself. I kept coming back to it for the smooth, easy drinkabiIity and pleasant flavors. I've revised the score up a little to reflect the fact that I thoroughly enjoyed it and have developed an appreciation for for this subtle spiced lager.

Albeit, the caramel malt is very good, but it's rather faint relative to the grainy notes. Some German hops as well.  On a side note, there's this sourdough yeast smell that's somewhat off-putting. Almost like a homebrew gone wrong.  T: Very mediocre for a bock. Grainy and somewhat sour (I hated the sourness of this beer), giving it the feel of a bad homebrew.

Some malt and breadiness to it mixed with a slight whiff of citrus or light berry.  T: The taste is rather enjoyable, if not overly simplistic. The malt flavor strikes you right away and lingers before dissipating into a slightly sweet mixture of orange peel and assorted spices.

M: Chewy, thick, lightly carbonated tingle with a dry finish.  O: Samuel Adams is generally my go to for non-craft brews. It's almost universally carried, isn't overly expensive, and most beers are above average. The winter lager isn't generally a favorite of mine but it isn't a bad beer. It's exceptionally average in many regards while being above in a few.

Taste: Lots of citrus up front, followed by some dry hops. Almost reminds me of a beefed-up Radler. The hops continue on through the taste, which doesn't linger too much but fades pleasantly. Overall: I'd throw this above Shiner and the other Texas bocks, but below Anchor's and more serious beers.

Appearance: A lustrous copper hue, with moderate carbonation and a three-finger light brownish head.  Aroma: Very light, slightly sweet. Definitely a berry smell.  Taste: It's definitely better than the Sam Adams Octoberfest, and I'm getting a slight berry bitterness that tickles the senses but doesn't bowl you over.

Mouthfeel: Medium body, lots of carbonation. Slightly bitter and biting on the tongue.  Overall: I'm going to agree with the Adjunct Hippie on this one. The Winter Lager is fairly decent, but it's not a bock. I liked it better at the beginning than toward the end.

35,101,hoptheology,4.12,"This one has been sitting in my beer fridge staring at me for the longest time. I gotta drink this one or else it will start crying.  Appearance (4.25) : Pours an aggressive tan-beige head. I'm measuring about four fingers. Actually I have a tape measure sitting right here. 3 1/4"". Impressive. Leaves lacing as it slowly recedes. The body is a dark honey color with about 30% opacity. Nice clarity on this one. Due to the massive head, the generous lacing, and the clarity of the dark body, I'm giving this one a solid 4.25.  Aroma (3.75) : Barley malt, oats, some faint wild berry, toasty grains; and finally darker earth notes upon very deep inhalation. Complex, characteristic. Bouquet is soft and weak, however.  Taste (4.25) : Well, this is quite interesting. The berry notes and the malt-heavy toasted grain play well with each other and are very loud. Hop bitterness is cheering from the sidelines, still present but kept on a margin by the barley and berry. The sour lambic-type taste gives it an interesting spin and the hops help balance out the malts nicely. It's very forward, very strong in the taste department, and for this reason it is a sipper and not a chugger. I will say, it is pretty impressive. I like the flavor, it's a true craft.  Mouthfeel (3.25) : Airy, light, estery...ends a tad papery and semi-dry. Medium bodied.  Overall (4.12) : If someone pushed this glass in front of me and told me it was from a top craft brewer, and they charged $15/4 pack, I would believe them. I would probably also try to find the beer to purchase it. This is actually a fine, fine beer and to think that Sam Adams made this is pretty incredible. It's got a great craft feel to it, a bit lambic and a bit festive, not too malty, not too hoppy, and that extra berry sourness just makes things interesting. The bottle talks about spice but I'm not intercepting any spice. Just good, berry, malty, hoppy goodness.  Edit : I see that this is a Bock. It is absolutely nothing like a Bock. I would knock the rating down but it's too good to do that. Approach it like a Bock and you'll probably be sorely disappointed. Approach it like a winter beer and you'll be jumping rope.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,jwhancher,3.47,"Was given a bottle from my neighbor over the winter. Best by month was March of this year but I did have it stored away in my fridge since at least that time. Poured into a Prima Pils glass for review.  Pours a dark copper/amber color with good fluffy white head that persists. Very good carbonation present.  Smells chewy with caramel and brown sugar. Cinnamon and nutmeg give it pie crust likeness. Orange peel seems faint but adds a subtle citrus note. All malt and spices, no hops in nose.  Tastes caramelly with candy bar like texture. Feels a bit chewy. Spices add some complexity. Fair amount of upfront bitterness. No hop flavor, again just malt and spices.  Medium- full mouthfeel. Alcohol is well in check. Seems to have a slight carbonic bite.  Well crafted Bock beer with spices. For me, I'd prefer simply the bock with no spices. Worth a try in the winter or fall times of year.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,BeerWithMike,4.65,"Sampled tonight on 3/12/15 though I last had this on draught in January at a local bar and grill. From their seasonal 'Winter Sampler"" (or comes in a 6-pack). Bottle chilled down to 36 degrees F in my beer cooler and poured into a vintage Sam Adam's pint glass.  Pours a nice dark amber in color with a thin off-white head. A good amount of acing was seen with each sip. The aroma is of caramel malts with a few spices. The taste of the caramel malts comes right though with some toffee, cinnamon and nutmeg in the mix as well. Very tasty with perfect carbonation. Medium-bodied. No harsh or bitter aftertaste at all. A tasty brew for the cooler months.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,FLima,3.33,"Transparent copper color with a thick head with medium retention. Predominant aroma of caramels and white bread. Sweet flavor of caramel malt, licorice, cinnamon and just a bit of soap, nutmeg and earthy and citrus hops (maybe just the orange peel). Wheat gave it some good roundness. Mildly dry aftertaste. Medium body with low carbonation. Decent beer for who likes malty beers with lots of caramels.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,RVigz,3.55,"Appearance: Dark amber color with an off-white head.  Smell: Typical lager maltyness with hints of sweet hops.  Taste: Sweet start with a malty bite and finishes with a sweet/malty/hoppy balance.  Mouthfeel: This is probably the best part of this beer as it is incredibly smooth and well carbonated.  Overall: A good ""anytime"" lager that isnt too special and isnt too heavy, but very drinkable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,LiquidAmber,3.79,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a one finger light tan head with good retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of mild caramel malt, slight holiday spicing. Flavor of sweet caramel malt, mild toffee, light cinnamon, finishes with caramel malt and light grassy hops. Medium bodied with a hint of creaminess. A pleasant light bock style beer with an appropriately mild holiday spicing. Is as I expect from Boston Beer, a nicely made, mellow ale that doesn't push the envelope, but is a satisfactory and enjoyable example of its style.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Bone53,3.37,"Served from a bottle into a tulip glass at around 45°F  Appearance: Dark amber with very little off white head that dissipates as fast as it arrived.  Smell: Sweet with caramel, cinnamon, and ginger notes.  Taste: To me this tastes like they ruined Boston Lager by adding spices to it.  Mouthfeel: Light as expected from Samuel Adams.. Goes down fast and easy.  Overall: I had low expectations and they were met. I'll stick with a Boston Lager if I want a Sam Adams.  *Following my last gulp the empty glass smelled just like a ginger bread cookie. It reminded me of some childhood memories. This was by far the highlight of this beer for me",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,illpass78,2.85,"12 oz. bottle poured into a nonic.  Appearance: Pours a clear reddish brown with a half-inch off-white head. Head retention is decent. Lacing is a little more than average. Looks like an attractive dark lager.  Aroma: I'm a little let down by this aspect of SAWL. The ad copy says it's made with cinnamon, orange peel and all these other good-smelling things. I expected it to smell like potpourri. It does not. It smells like malt and wheat. Citrus is very, very faint at best. Forgettable aromas.  Taste: Follows the nose, which means the flavors teased in the ad copy are nearly nonexistent. I didn't expect them to dominate, but orange is faint and cinnamon is very, very faint. Tastes like a decent wheaty dark bock. It's not bad but I expected more.  Mouthfeel: Kind of thin and watery. Not super impressed by the body of this beer; there are bocks out there that make a bolder statement on the palate.  Overall: This is a decent straight-up bock. There are better bocks, and better winter seasonals, on the market. I had this with a homemade pizza and some roasted vegetables, and it didn't fail to compliment the meal, but it didn't add much either. This is the kind of beer I would only get again if it was the only thing on draft that wasn't a BMC lager or a light beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Easily drinkable, good for a winter beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Light wieght on the month with light carbonation. Some honey & Carmel upfront, with a sour bready finish. Honestly I think this is very plain tasting beer, no complexity.  I'm a SA fan and have had a dozen of their brews, this is my least favorite, just not enough there. Easy to drink but the sour finish is a turn off for me.

Beer is carbonated nicely light body, sessionable. Overall, a very good beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Haydn-Juby,3.75,"A: An amber brown color topped with a finger of beige head. Good retention and lacing as well.  S: I get no spices as advertised however there is an appealing breadiness and its quiet malty.  T: Once again very little spices show up but they are in the background. Something in the vein of nutmeg or cinnamon pokes its head in the finish but I probably wouldn't know if no one told me. A nice malty body shows up , like in the Boston lager, being similar to bread crust and a little bit toasty. A bit of noble hops show up too being a bit spicy and earthy.  M: A bit creamy and a substantial body size. A fairly dry body and its easily drinkable.  O: A really good beer. Perhaps not what I would pin as great spice beer or bock for that matter ,its a very drinkable and nice lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Poured into a stange; dark amber, clear with a nice big creamy-yellow head that descends very slowly, leaving lots of lacing. Smells of caramel malt, light sweetness. Bready, with a hint of spice. Taste is clean, bready and lightly sweet. Nice and malty, not much hint of spice in the flavor. Slight metallic finish. Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated and smooth, nice body for the style. Slightly more robust than a lager, but less than a doppelbock. Overall, it's about what I'd expect from a standard beer from SA; to-style, well-made, but relatively boring. But, it's a fine tasty beer that would be great with a meal, for cooking, or alone.

S: Dark fruit, orange peel, spice--this is a winter warmer crossed with a weizenbock, and smells just like I would expect.  T: A splash of cinnamon across the tongue, followed by orange peel, sweet malt, and a little malt bitterness to close things out. Quite nice, really.  M: Prickly carbonation--too much.

35,101,Rhf9120,4.68,Big fan of this one. Smells of cinnamon and nutmeg with hits of citrus. The taste is a pleasant mixture of the spices and citrus with a slightly bitter after taste.

35,101,Bosoxfan20,3.8,"A- Pours a deep, clean, amber with a 2 finger off white head that hangs around for about 20 secs before leaving a soft, thin layer.  S- Cinnamon and nutmeg blend with citrus fruit notes. It is an interesting combination, but it has peaked my interest. Reminds me some of a fall/pumpkin style lager to this point.  T- Sweet notes come before same tangy flavors, and then finishing with a common lager bitterness. Once again, more fall than winter character, but they come on pretty strong for the style, so it hits the spot nonetheless. Spices flow quite nicely with some of the juicy, acidic citrus. Love the complexity  M- A bit light for the style, but overall well done here. Thin on the tongue, but goes down rather easy. A nice touch of warmth in the back of the throat.  O- Maybe my favorite offering from Boston Beer Co. Yeah, so I feel that it is more of a fall beer than that of winter. So what.

Taste - Strong flavour of sweet malts along with the dark fruits. Spices not as prominent as expected by the aroma. Caramel sweetness.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.

35,101,Andrew041180,3.67,"A: Arrived a deep amber/ruby color. Very clear. I like the color a lot. Not much as far as lacing or visible carbonation go. Very little head which did not appear to be an issue with the glass, but may have been due to the pour.  S: Not much is noticeable here, a vague sweetness is all.  T: Sweet malts dominate, but not in an overbearing way. Caramels and toffee type flavors, with very little apparent contribution from the hops. There is also a very mild spice flavor that actually adds to the beer. This is rare for me, as usually all I can taste is the spice.  M: Very little above average by way of mouthfeel. On the light side of medium bodied. Just a touch of texture.  O - Nice crowd pleaser for the winter months. Not a lot to get excited about here, but certainly nothing to complain about.

Can detect both the hops and roasted malts, but they are a bit subtle. Can smell some spices too.  Taste: Good balance between the hops and malt flavors. The mouth feel is smooth and crisp, but a little thin. The taste is complex and full of multiple flavors. A nice balance between the bitterness of the hops and the sweetness of the malts with some spice flavors, makes this an enjoyable beer to drink. A nice long aftertaste that doesn't turn bitter.

35,101,bullseyestrat,4.43,"Samuel Adams Winter Lager is one of my winter favourites. Its a very full bodied and bold beer by any standards. Rather complex and filling but more willing to let you have another after another. I've had Sam Adams Winter Lager in a bottle, can, and on tap. Honestly there's no difference in taste other than the can is a wee bit more foamy like other Sam Adams cans available. The appearance is more of a dark brownish black like most bock beers and dark lagers. Looks imitating at first to most light beer drinkers but its easy to get used to. Smellwise its more of a full bodied smell with a bit of ginger in there. Tastewise its a rather complex beer without being too pretentious in itself. Very full and bold with some ginger and spices that aren't easily obvious. In the mouth Sam Adams Winter Lager is very tame and smooth. Very odd for a full Bock Lager like as such really. Overall Samuel Adams Winter Lager is probably the best winter beer available in my opinion. I mean I do like Harpoon's, Narragensetts, or Long Trails offerings but Sams Winter Lager will always be a winter favourite.

Color is quite nice, a clear dark amber/light ruby Not too much of a nose to it, malt with a touch of spice and a slight citrus hop aroma. Beer itself tastes about the same. Malty, get a touch of cinnamon and residue bite from the ginger, then hops which aren't very heavy. Feels a little thin in the mouth, like something the should be for thirst quenching in the summer.

T: As with the aroma, there is a spice laden flavor to this one. All the same spices that you get in the aroma. Fairly powerful spice but doesnt overwhelm and make it seem like its no longer a beer.  M: Medium body with ample carbonation. A bit of stickiness but still quite drinkable.  Overall this lager fits well into the winter scene with its pleasant dose of spice.

The beer is a fairly pale yellowish brown with a reddish tinge, and is crystal clear. Carbonation is light. A very nice looking beer.  I get mostly clean malt in the nose with a hint of spice. The taste is of slightly sweet malt, a bit of caramel, maybe a very slight fruitiness akin to cantaloup, and just a kiss of earthy hops. The spice is there but I can't quite discern what it might consist of- a little nutmeg maybe. The spice is definitely not overbearing. The overall flavor is quite clean and lager-like. The mouthfeel is tingly with a pleasant burpiness leading to a bittersweet aftertaste, and with just a touch of a soapy feel from the spice.

Smell: Malty and sweet with a pronounced note of orange peel and subtler hints of cinnamon.  Taste: Very malty and rich at first with a dominating bitterness toward the finish that seems to come more from orange peel than hops. There is some spice, but it's extremely subtle in the taste.  Mouthfeel: Appropriate for the style, though a bit highly carbonated. Light, but not thin.  Overall: A solid lager but not much more than that. I personally feel it could have been better balanced or even leaned more heavily on the spices to create something a little more ""winterish"".

35,101,mfnmbvp,3.43,"12 oz. bottle, with label notched at best before March 2014. A new winter seasonal to me from Samuel Adams, acquired as part of the winter variety twelve pack. Expectations are about average given the brewery and the style, but I don't really know what to expect.  Poured into a Firestone Walker pint glass.  A - Pours just over a finger of soft fluffy tan head on top of a dark copper colored body. Looks alright, but fairly unimpressive.  S - Smell is pretty light and subdued. Dark grains, some cola / cherry sweetness, a hint of the cinnamon & spicy ginger, and some citrus zest, probably from the orange peel. Not terribly powerful smelling, but you can pull distinct aromas from it if you try.  T - Taste follows the nose: dark toasted wheat, chocolate maltiness, some medicinal cherry which could possibly be the cinnamon, a hint of the ginger, and a light citrus tartness on the finish from the orange peel.  M - Feel is smooth and clean. Light bodied with crisp carbonation.  Overall, a fairly tame and uninteresting, yet safe and approachable take on the style from Samuel Adams. A nice winter offering for the mixed twelve pack, that's for sure, because I couldn't see myself wanting too much of this one. Worth a try.

A full range of malt, from the caramel and rick dark breads, slight molasses tones, and a light hint of grass and floral hops that faded to a mildly bitter close.

35,101,CalgaryFMC,3.6,"Snagged a six-pack from the same place I found the superlative Lagunitas Little Sumpin' (see that review). I am a big advocate of Boston Lager and like this brewery well enough, gimmicks like ""chocolate cherry porter"" notwithstanding. Why does everyone have to murder porter with all kinds of additives and random flavorings like chai spices and sock lint? Its not already an interesting style? Its kinda like how a beer is magically made ""wintery"" by chucking in some spices. Bock is already supposed to be pretty hearty and rich. Ahem. I digress. This winter bock pours a rather pretty red-orange amber color, with around three fingers of light tan foam and a pleasant aroma of mellow rich dark malts, caramel, molasses, a little sour dark fruit like sultanas. Nice but the whole aroma is downplayed, like great song on the radio that you want to crank up but the volume knob is unfortunately busted. Taste is similar, with some toasty bread crusts, biscuits, barley-based coffee substitute and crackers, subdued caramel and molasses as per the nose, and candied plums along with herbal/spicy hop notes. Some would have the cinnamon, ginger, and orange peel spice addition amped up. I respectfully disagree. This is actually an example of skilled spice use in brewing, the spices provide a background warmth and some aromatics but not at the expense of everything else. I get a little sulphur on the nose and perhaps the palate as well, maybe a hint of DMS, but at expected levels for a lager and these components add complexity without being nasty. Fairly light body but semi-chewy nonetheless and the finish is quite nice: The malts stick around, there's some hop leaf and a floral sweet spice like licorice tablets. Has some of the sweet and sour character of old world porters. This beer used to be higher ABV and more flavorful (or so I read, wasn't into beer back then), too bad its been neutered a bit because its pretty good now and must have been even better ""back in the day"". Compare it to Anchor Bock, which has bolder flavors but perhaps less complexity.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Chiefy770,3.83,"Poured from a bottle into a nonic pint glass.  Appearance: The body had a similar color to tea (you know, brown with an orange hue). A white, fluffy foam head collapsed and left a mediocre amount of lace.  Smell: Grains stand out. Mild sweetness breaks through. A minor amount of spice. Smells like a sweet bun.  Taste: Sweet and toasty malts up front. Minor spice notes are around but do bring much to the table. This beer is much sweeter than I anticipated. It is not an overwhelming sweetness, just more than I thought there would be. The hops are incredibly minor but subtly break out in the aftertaste.  Overall: Not half bad. Personally, this could very well fall under the ""brown ale"" style but hey, I don't make those sort of calls. A tad more spice could not hurt. Great to enjoy on a cold night. A pinch too sweet to make this a session beer. Worth trying but is low on my list of must-have winter seasonals.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Sweet, but not sickeningly so as the more acidic orange balances it out. Not getting much of the cinnamon that the smell pointed towards, but there is a slight spice kick.

The head doesn't stick around long and their isn't much lacing but not a big deal. The scent is a lot like the taste, very balanced with very very light citrus and some other spices which Sam Adams claims cinnamon among, although it isn't easy to pick up anything specific. I actually got some ginger and something of a coriander scent although I doubt it's actually in the beer but that's fine I like coriander. The mouth-feel is pleasant and full....not too water and not too creamy, like I said balance was their aim here. The taste is very pleasant with a bouquet of spices and notes, none of which jump out at you, but I think that's why this recipe works so well. Hints of ginger and orange for sure and you will get some cinnamon on the taste, something I didn't get from the scent. This is a very very smooth beer and this is something anyone can enjoy. Some of the more ""refined"" beer snobs might be a bit disappointed with the ""lack"" of complexity or boldness but putting this in perspective as a fine seasonal brew, I think it's pretty damn good and would recommend this to anyone.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Taste: A very earthy taste, i can taste nuts and the malt. Alcohol finishes it off.  Mouthfeel: very little carbonation, and not very thick beer, which makes for a good combination.

Cool amber red body with an off-white head that hung around for a while in my tooth brush holder.

35,101,jondeelee,3.46,"Winter Lager opens to a bready nose with decent touches of sweetness and spice, the initial aromas quickly fading to a plainer base of cereal grains, with light sweetness and spice. The grain notes are probably the most noticeable, with Grape Nuts cereal, biscuit, toast, and wet hay dominating. Sugars come in second place, but are rather faint after the first blush wears off, adding some berry and apricot notes, these mixing with a light grapefruit hit from the hops. The spices mainly come across as peppery and somewhat indistinguishable due to weakness, though bits of ginger and orange do come through. As a whole, the nose is decent, but weak, and dominated excessively by grain notes, the sugars and spice almost falling by the wayside. It’s a shame that the initial aromas couldn’t last a bit longer.  On the tongue, the beer opens with a decent grain and sugar hit, with toast, biscuit, and Grape Nuts cereal coming from the former, and the latter adding a nice caramel blast, as well as light berry, orange, and apricot fruit esters. The spices seem to come in around mid-mouthful, with ginger and white pepper making the biggest noise, and the cinnamon mainly adding a touch more spice, as well as pepper, but almost indistinguishably so. In subsequent mouthfuls the peppery spices take a larger role, giving an almost rye-like quality to the beer, and the sugars unfortunately move into the background, leaving peppery spice and toast as the main notes. The aftertaste is a continuation of the peppery toast, with some light fruit esters and a touch of grapefruit remaining, and lingers for a short while. Mouthfeel is medium-light to medium, and carbonation is medium.  Overall, the initial perceptions given by both the aroma and the taste were very nice. Unfortunately, subsequent examples of both couldn’t live up the promise, and the beer came across as more watery than expected. There are still good flavors in here, but they needed to be cranked up a notch to be noticed—especially the sugars, which are almost lost.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

35,101,Damian,3.66,"Drank from a 12 fl. oz. bottle For brewery-fresh taste, enjoy before month notched APR Served in a pint glass  Thanks to my dad for saving me one of each beer from the Winter Classics Variety Pack.  A dense, foamy, two-finger rocky cap of tan colored froth topped the crystal clear amber liquid. The head slowly fell to a thick cap. A drippy curtain of sticky lacing coated the glass.  Crisp, dry, powdery yeast notes dominated the aroma initially. As the head fell, spices and orange zest came forth. Touch of ginger. Caramel malts lent some sweetness.  The flavor profile was a touch more muted than the nose. Caramel malts came through on the front end. Generic spice notes appeared in the center. Some citrus zest as well. There was a slightly buttery quality on the back end that signified this as being a lager. Earthy hops appeared in the finish.  The mouthfeel was a bit of a letdown. It was somewhat thin with a crisp, bubbly effervescence.  Sam Adams has been making a number of respectable beers lately, along with a lot of forgettable, nondescript standbys. This beer definitely qualifies as one of the latter.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Pours crystal clear reddish copper color with a nice 1-2 finger fairly dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a nice amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of apple, pear, caramel, ginger, toast, grass, cracker, light pepper, and herbal. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and solid complexity. Taste of apple, pear, caramel, toast, cracker, grass, ginger, light cinnamon, light citrus, and light herbal spiciness. Lingering notes of light fruits, caramel, toast, bread, grass, ginger, light cinnamon, and light herbal on the finish for a short bit. Nice flavor balance with a fair amount of robustness; with a nice subtle balance of the added spices; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and very smooth mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a good bock style. Good flavor balance with a fair amount of robustness; and extremely smooth to drink.

35,101,TheQuietMan22,3.61,"Serving type: 12-ounce bottle. The “enjoy before month notched” is “MAY.”  Appearance: Poured into a flute. The color is ruddy copper. A finger of eggshell-colored head dissipated fairly quickly to leave a very thin skim and a bubbly ring around the edge.  Smell: Caramel, toffee, brown sugar, cherry licorice, apple, a little dark fruit (perhaps raspberry or fig), and grassy hops.  Taste: The malts give way to a much more generalized beer bitterness. They begin to emerge after it has warmed a bit, though. Toasted malts, caramel, toffee, brown sugar — which are punctuated with an average bite for the aftertaste. The apple, cherry licorice, and other fruity flavors come in late.  Drinkability: A solid brew. Upon first impression, it is not too festive or wintery but it is tasty drinking. It will do the job.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,GeoffTBreashears,3.75,"Firstly this beer is always a favorite of mine for the winter season. Upon pouring from a bottle there was a beautiful thick foamy head, however there was very little retention as the head dissipated quickly, leaving almost nothing more than a thin film of foam. The appearance held a nice dark amber color.  The smell was a malty sweet scent. Very appealing.  The taste was a nice balance of malt and spices...cinnamon, nutmeg, etc. Light hops, enough to create a slight spicy bitterness that was very nice, especially on a cold winters night. Being a winter lager the beer was a bit thicker and heavier than most, but perfect for the season. The carbonation was not at all overbearing and seemed to be at just the right balance.  Overall I would highly recommend that this beer at least be given a try during the winter months. It is definitely the most widely distributed and most well known winter brew, but don't let this deter you from giving it a try, as I'm sure it will come to hold a regular spot in your fridge over the cold season.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Some have complained of the spices used in this beer, but even though I am not a big fan of spices in beer I don't feel it was over- or under-done with SA Winter Lager.  Would I buy it again? Sure - I'd like to try it on draft, and if discounted at the beer store I'll pick up another bottle or two.  Would I recommend it? Depends on the other options available, but if at a beer bar or store with a wide selection, I'd probably recommend a pass (but not take any offense if my advice was ignored).",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Maxwell,3.11,"The beer pours a candied brown, bordering on amber, with a huge fluffy cream head with yellowing notes. The beers body is lager clean, completely free of any haze, and quite translucent, though the beer’s darkness does fight this a little bit. The lacing is fat and sticky, leaving webbing behind on my mug. On the nose, the beer smells spicy, with a little too much cinnamon burn and a note of ginger. Slight citrus notes are found when the glass is swirled, and underlying all the smells is a caramelly smell that is tinged with wheat. The beer tastes abrasively spicy with a clear cinnamon burn that seems to hurt the other flavors. The beer begins with light caramel malts and slight cinnamon before opening into a slightly biscuity malt that is immediately torn out of the mouth by the cinnamon spice which drowns out most other notes and lingers in the mouth. Slight hints of the ginger and orange peel can be felt at the fringes of the palate, and perhaps a touch of grassy hops can be tasted, but this is all below the cinnamon, which is rocking around on the palate like an unwanted elephant. This flavor is much spicier than I recall it being in years past, and is really hurt by the overwhelming cinnamon. Now, when I say it tastes like cinnamon, I don’t mean the nice cinnamon flavors of a baked good, but the burn with a slight bitter flavor that you get from putting too much cinnamon in your mouth… In case anyone was thinking I was just complaining about the taste of cinnamon… On the mouth, the beer feels medium bodied with a slight chew to it. Carbonation gives a little bite in the beginning, and then mellows over the tongue to provide a clean drink, though the spices punch nasty burns on my tongue. The mouth is left dry with a spice burn after the beer has left, with saliva only on the very edges of my tongue. Overall, this is a very heavy handed beer. I’ve had a couple of this year’s batch, and I have to say that the Boston Beer Company really overdid the spice this year. On their site they claim they searched far and wide this year to bring the best cinnamon sticks all the way from Vietnam, and while I applaud them on finding cool foreign ingredients, I wish they would stop playing with a recipe that tasted perfectly fine last year. This beer needs to tone down its spice so that other flavors can be enjoyed. I am a little weirded out that no one else has said anything else about the spice for this years version, so maybe it was just my pack, though that would be very strange... Perhaps its just my palate? Anyways, its cheap and easily found so try it for yourself, don't trust my opinion.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

The bock pours out a dark-golden brown with a lightly tanned head. The head pours thick but disappears quickly as though it were wispy. The smell of the beer was incredible - my nose was pleasantly assaulted with the aroma of spice, cinnamon, and oranges - it was truly great. I was surprised at the rich taste of this lager - rivaling their Boston Lager in my opinion. I could distinctly taste everything I smelled from the bottle making it a great experience.

The head has decent retention fading to give a lighter level of lacing  Smell – The aroma is biggest of some caramel and bready malt with notes of some spices mostly of a cinnamon and ginger nature .  Taste – The taste starts out of sweet caramel and a nice toasted malt and bready taste. There are notes of cinnamon and ginger that quickly come to the taste. These flavors last throughout with some more bitter citrus flavors coming and going as the taste moves on. In the end a lightly roasted malty flavor with a very light herbal hop are left on the tongue.  Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the medium side with a carbonation level that is average to below average. Both good for the bock nature of the brew.

Flavor begins with sweet malt and caramel, with a moderate level of floral hop bitterness. This moves into some indeterminable sweet spices in the middle alongside the malt, caramel and hops and some breadiness and toasty malt flavors. The finish continues those flavors with a nice aftertaste of caramel and floral hops. A good, malty, sweet, yet not cloying flavor profile. Quite balanced between sweetness and hops.

The malts are pretty huge in this. The taste is similar to Samuel Adams' Pumpkin Ale mixed with their Oktoberfest. The bottle mentions some cinnamon and nutmeg, and it's there, but appropriately it's more in the background. A very enjoyable beer.

On the tongue, just what you'd expect form a great snow seasonal; mild hop presence, a slight ginger bite mixed a fuller sweetness from the cinnamon and orange, thick and creamy (reminiscent of cream sodas), with a warm lingering finish.

35,101,BarryMFBurton,3.43,"Time for a seasonal I’ve always had the urge to try: Sam Adams Winter Lager. Here’s hoping it’s better than the last beer “brewed with spices” I had from these guys: their pumpkin ale.  Enjoy by April, five months after the date of this tasting.  A: Shining red color with an absolute torrent of bubbles in the body – the space above the nucleation site looks like a jet in a Jacuzzi. Despite that foray of fizz, there’s only a short, creamy white head and minimal lacing. A bump of retention appears in the direct middle of the glass, churning with the rising bubbles.  S: Very Sam Adams-like; that is, very average for this brewer and in general. Grainy, red malts appear with a touch of vegetable to it before cascading its mild caramel and cinnamon-sugar tones. Some roasted barley, orange zest, coriander, and ginger peek through to give this an edge of shandy, nearly, and a profile quite reminiscent of their Harvest Pumpkin.  T: Instantly recognizable as something that was mass-produced, as light, grainy wheat overpowers all that more complex malt presence; indeed, some chocolate, cinnamon bread, and raisin are evident underneath, but nowhere near the fullness of the duller grains. Spice notes of lemon, ginger, and white pepper dot the edges of the palate, picked up by a little herbal hop kick; biscuity and thick on the ends. Finishes with a fortunate taste of earthen bread, leaving the BMC malts as a mere memory, though with a hop dryness that seems a little artificial – like an extract was used.  M: This isn’t a beer that seems like sub-6% ABV, with smooth chewiness and a medium body. No noticeable carbonation disturbing the body on this one.  O: This was a better-than-average Sam Adams beer, but not by much. A respectable, cheap dark lager if that’s your thing (and you can’t find any Boston Lager).",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Bitterness and spicing come in at the same time in the finish: bitterness is light, good for balance; spicing is delicate, with cinnamon up front.  Mouthfeel ~ a bit of a lighter body and higher carbonation than most bocks: medium body and medium-high carbonation. Surprisingly dry finish really supports spicier end.  I really like all bock varieties and this is a solid offering by SA. Not as complex as some continental varieties; it is very tasty and more balanced than many others. Spicing is a nice addition to the style!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,rdunigan,3.8,Ahhh...Sam Adams. I have found most of their offerings to be solid choices...no different with the winter lager. Drank this out of a bottle with April as the notched as the month to drink by for best taste. Got this at my local krogers on sale in the Winter Variety pack. Good looking brew poured into my pint glass. The smell is bready with strong orangy overtones. I think this beer tastes great. Hops and spices from start to finish. Overall a great winter lager. cheers!,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Smell: Caramel and biscuits with a grassy undertone. Sweet and bready. Serious bread action, like moist brown bread. Faintest hint of hops add a mild spiciness. Very mellow and unassuming.  Taste: Malts and more malts. Bread, biscuit, and caramel all over a faint spiciness. Grassy and gritty. Flavors never really blend together, but fight and come across in waves. As it warms it takes on an aggressively bready, almost yeasty quality. Watery at times.  Mouthfeel: Moderate, but barely. Carbonation is on the high side. Drinks pretty smooth, but packs a slight rough edge on the finish of each sip.  Overall: I remember my first encounter with this beer. It's much the same now. It's a mess when it warms. When it's super cold it's drinkable, but as it warms it falls apart and becomes a watery mess.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

35,101,shigg85,4,"This is one of the go-to winter holiday beers. The taste and the smell go hand-in-hand producing a cloud of wintery spice and everything nice. It pours a nice amber brown into a glass and retains a small little head for the first half of the beer. After that, the appearance can begin to fail a bit as it loses its carbonation and (too large) of pieces of spice/flower begin floating around in the glass. As much as I like real solid pieces of the mix in my brew, these can get in the way of just enjoying the drink.

35,101,thehyperduck,3.58,"Tried yesterday, and reviewed from notes. 12 ounce bottle pulled from a six-pack and served in a mug.  Poured a clear amber-copper colour, topped with about two fingers of fluffy off-white head. Good retention, with minimal lacing. Pleasant aroma of toasted, bready amber malts and caramel, with some understated spicy notes of cinnamon and ginger.  Simple, elegant taste, with well-restrained spiciness. Mostly malt-dominated, with lots of bready toasted malts, caramel and a slight orange citrus. Kind of a gingerbread feel. Cinnamon is the most dominant spice, but there are notes of ginger and allspice that linger into the finish - which provides a bit of herbal dryness, but is overall rather malty like the rest of the flavour profile. On the thin side of medium-bodied, with a bit too much carbonation for my liking.  I was expecting a winter warmer when I tried this, but a spiced-up bock is probably the next best thing. The only serious concern I have with this brew is the fairly light, fizzy body - I prefer my bocks to be a little sturdier - but given the 5.5% abv I assume they were aiming to make a light, sessionable brew rather than a serious sipper. I'm ok with this.  Final Grade: 3.58, a solid, respectable B-grade. This is an excellent winter session lager. It is refreshing and light, not overly complex, and the spices are well-integrated (i.e. not overpowering). There are other bocks and warmers I would pick before SA's Winter Lager, but this is a noticeably light, easy-drinking example for the style. Worth a try, but not a worldbeater.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

There is a nice malt smell that I haven't really picked up on in other brews, I like it.  Oh! This tastes a lot better than I expected. I haven't had all the Sam Adams beers, but I feel a lot of them go for strong bitter and strong malts, but this one is a lot more subdued, which allows the fruits to come through.

M: Medium bodied, full, and somewhat fluffy. Moderate carbonation rounds it out nicely.  O: A good winter seasonal. Spices are reined in just enough. Nice body too.

35,101,falloutsnow,3.5,"Purchased as part of the seasonal pack from Hyvee in Omaha, NE. Best by April 2012 notched on the bottle's label. Poured into a standard US pint glass.  The Sam Adams' winter lager is a malt-forward seasonal beer that just misses the appropriate balance between its sweetness and hop or spice complexity. The malt component is on the borderline of cloying, not allowing the additional pieces of this beer to appropriately shine through. At times, I was reminded of Great Lakes' Christmas Ale with the use of ginger and cinnamon and a malt-forward beer, but the Sam Adams seemed to be missing a clarity of taste in relationship to that. Its aroma is satisfying, while the appearance and mouthfeel are only about average. The result is a slightly muddied, though still tasty and better than anything I could pull off, winter bock.  Pours a tall, dirty-white head that's made up of small and medium-sized bubbles. Head declines in a minute or two to a fairly thin ring around the glass with some small foam islands in the center. No lacing to speak of. Body is a dark brown-orange in color when in a secluded area, copper-orange when held to a light. Transparent in body, with a few streams of quite active, visible carbonation.  Aromas of fairly sweet, dark maltiness, and some noticeable orange zest. Less apparent, but present, are cinnamon and ginger scents.  Taste opens with a strong malt component, somewhat dark sweetness, with slight citrus rind, transitioning to some obvious spiciness from hops and added ginger, cinnamon. Begins to fade out with a return of sweetness and some very mild cinnamon, ending with some strong grain and milder biscuit components. Aftertaste is well-balanced between malt sweetness and mild bitterness from hops, with a citrus flavor edge, perhaps from the added orange rind or hops. In general, tastes a bit too sweet for me, could use some more balance from hops or additional spices.  Body is about medium in heaviness with adequate, but slightly less carbonation than I think would be optimal. The result is a fairly smooth lager, whereas I would like a bit more crispness with the body and lower alcohol content. Finish is fairy dry, a bit wet around the edges.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

A slight citrus tartness and dry spiciness accent this lager, along with a toasted grassy note and an ever-so-slight diacetyl tone. The finish is quite dry.

I had this offering on-tap earlier in the season and I definitely prefer the bottled version for this year. That is unusual as I tend to prefer tapped versions of a beer over the bottled sampling.  I paired this with a spicy (as in hot sauce) cheese kielbasa sandwich and it held up very well.

The smell is spicy, almost exotic - again, something I would normally associate with warmer times. This is completely personal preference, of course! Maltiness is quite apparent - my mouth is still feeling dried out by it as we speak! I'd prefer if the slight hoppiness of this brew were more balanced with some comfortable sweetness; the malty feel seems to call for that.

The cap is a little cratery and is sparsely populated with tiny bubbles. The amber-copper body is alive with carbonation columns.  Smell- The heavy malt is sweet and toffee-like in character. I detect a little bit of orange peel, but not much else is distinguishing itself.  Taste- The palate is much less malty. The spice really zips over the tongue with hints of cinnamon and ginger that blend quite well with the crystal malt. The distinct Bavarian hop really hits home in the finish.  I think the spice could stand to really linger much more than it does. It is mostly an after thought by the finish.  Mouth feel- The Winter Lager has a solid medium body and is quite chewy. The coating is great. It makes the finish go on forever. Again, I just wish it was the spices that were lingering, not the Bavarian hops.  Overall- This is mostly the Boston Lager with some muddled spices added. And if that is what they were going for, then I guess they hit this brew right between the eyes.  I really think this could have been amped up with the spices, maybe even kick the alcohol up a bit and make it more interesting.

35,101,canucklehead,3.62,From the look of this beer it looks like they might be trying to recreate the type of beers that show up in Norway in the Xmas season. It is a Vienna lager in style and actually tasted a little like Negro Modelo in its caramel notes in the nose and the also the malty finish. Easy drinking yet with enough complexity to make it interesting. With all the winter ales out there it is nice to see a winter lager.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,SaCkErZ9,3.41,"Pours from a 12oz bottle into a Sam Adams pint glass; you know, the one with the etching on the bottom, the lip on the top, the curvy figure, the one that costs like $10? Emerges crystal clear and amber in color with a decent white head. That revolutionary etching on the bottom is keeping the head taut and firm.  Aroma was a bit lackluster. Certainly malty in body with a little bit of chalky astringency in the nose. Slightly bready with a touch of burnt cracker.  Fairly tasty brew. Really bready and cracker-like in the finish. Really lingers in the finish. Slightly sweet with a nice hop balance that keeps this one in check and away from the sweet side of things. Again, slightly chalky with a touch of fruits. I am guessing there are some noble hops in this one because there is an underlying taste similar to their Noble Hop pale ale.  A pretty good beer. SA has always put out stellar beer and for the price, I think they are the best in the business. I could certainly drink some of these over the winter months.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,notchucknorris,3.3,"On tap at The Counter  A: Clear deep brown color with an almost nonexistent tan head.  S: Sweet and malty with some breadiness. A bit of faint spices as well, but really not much shines through.  T: Light and malty flavor with some bready malts and a touch of ginger and maybe some other spices I couldn't quite pick out. It's by no means bad, but none of the flavors really jump out at you.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,thecheapies,2.84,"Garnet body. Little head. Not much lacing.  Stale hop and doughy malt in the nose. Mild sweet spice, hard to pinpoint. Smells of dark wheat. Candy-like sweetness. I get some cinnamon and maybe roast apples. Not appalling, but not my cup of tea.  Whew! There's the cinnamon, almost powdery in feel. Touch of allspice and a little caraway seed. Flatline flavors. The cinnamon is burping back up.  Medium body with pretty weak carbonation. I hope it's the tap system's fault.  Not a recommended Sam Adams seasonal in my book. It's cloying, one-sided, and difficult to keep drinking. Got this one by mistake after ordering a Boston Lager. Not a fan.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,dmfrench,3.58,"Pleasant but somewhat metallic spiced up hoppier Bock ___  A: Deep and slightly dulled clear red/orange body with a somewhat persistent one finger yellowed white head.  S: Light and dry euro hops, some lightly buttered biscuit malt, and just tiny hints of spices, though I really can't identify any individuals. A bit of metallic zing is present as well.  T: Spices come out much stronger on the palate. I can say orange zest for sure, maybe ginger, but I'm really not getting cinnamon as a distinct entity. The spices sit on top of and balance well with the regular dusty hop and dry malt flavors. A bit of an adunct/metallic vibe takes away from an otherwise pleasant experience.  M: A hair thin, but fine textured and appropriately carbonated (not too much).",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,LeRose,3.58,"Poured cold into a Sam Adams lager glass.  I really liked the color - reddish/brown, clear. Decent head, lasted a while, a little lacing on the glass.  The nose - just a hint of the spices - ginger and cinnamon right away and something else I couldn't figure out. Nutmeg or cardamom maybe? Nice hit of orange aroma as well.  Thought the taste was pretty bold. I have had this every year they have made it and maybe my CRS syndrome is kicking in, but seemed a lot more flavorful - maybe just thinking critically about it. The spices are not overwhelming, just a touch of orange/citrus taste, but kind of acidic with a little bitter on the end. I liked it less the warmer it got - to me the mouth feel changed and it started leaving more aftertaste and coated the tongue.  Like it, will buy it again next year.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,obrike,3.58,"One of the offerings in the winter mix 12pack.  Like the look..pours a very nice red/brown with uniform sudsy head. Some lacing sticks around too.  Smells ok, a little subdued, but there is a faint winter spice nose there (cinammon...nutmeg?)  Tastes ok as well, nothing great but certainly quite drinkable. A little like an adjunct lager at first, but it smooths out with some of the christmas spices on the backend.  Overall this is an above average brew, and a nice change of pace from the normal SA Lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Beautiful head,but not white,more creamy bone color. The grains are in the aroma,cant smell any skunky hops. A very nice suprise to the taste buds,a very full bodied (whatever that means) lager.

The flavor is a slight tart at first but very balanced. This beer warms you well as a good winter beer should. Hints of spice, but other than that not terribly different from basic Sam lager to me.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

35,101,akorsak,3.8,"A 12 oz bottle from a winter mix case. Thanks macnak. In a mini tulip cuz I'm just that classy.  A: The bockbier is a dark color, deep cuprous amber but just barely translucent. Situated atop the bock is a crème-hued head that provides a moderate start and adequate lacing afterwards.  S: Toasted malts, caramel and fresh bread, start the nose off right. The spices quickly follow with the cinnamon and ginger coming through nicely (and complimenting the malts). Mild hoppiness brings the citrus.  T: The spiciness, evident in the aromas, comes through even stronger in the first sip. A mulled bock, the cinnamon and orange zest come through very nicely. The ginger adds an Eastern sensibility, tangy and sweet. Toasted malts, bready and caramelly, are a perfect accompaniment, chewy enough to stand out but not so strong as to crowd out the spices. Served at, or close to, room temperature, the beer fires nicely.  M: I'm wondering about how this beer would taste if warmed up, maybe mulled with some additional spices. Funny how certain beers can continue to surprise me...",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,jneiswender,3.29,Poured out of a 12oz bottle into a 4oz sample glass. Served cool. Pours an off white head and a nice reddish brown amber body. Very clear. Yeast is strong in the nose. A bit course in the malt department. Not smooth and almost candy-like most bocks. As it warms you get a little more depth to the malt. Hops is there in the background but you don't think about it. Not a bad beer but not what it use to be. The nose is too yeasty. I remember when this beer was very spicy and holiday like.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,ToasterChef,3.53,"A bottled stored in my chilly cellar is poured into a pint glass.  The beer is clear, colored caramel brown and has an average amount of rising carbonation. The thick brown foam head settles down to a small, but even layer of foam. Patchy lacing is left behind.  I can smell a lot of cinnamon coming off of this beer, as well as a good mixture of malts, but mostly gingerbread.  The beer has a good malt flavor, with its spicier elements being more prominent near the finish. Cinnamon and ginger are both tasted. The malt base has a candy like flavor, close to caramel or toffee, but neither is an exact description. THe spices leave a lingering pepperiness.  The beer is a touch stickier than I expected. My lips are left slightly sticky and the coating in my mouth is thicker than I thought it would be. It does contain some of the malty sweetness I tasted.  This is a fine winter lager. It's not one I would go out of my way for—in fact, I don't enjoy it as much as some of the other Sam winter seasonals—but I'm glad I have a few bottles to enjoy.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,BucannonXC5,3.97,"Poured from a bottled into a pint glass. Color was amber with hints of brown and red in there. Minimal head. No lacing on the top. No film on the sides.  First smell was spicy malts, cinnamon first? Also some roasty caramel malts in there as well.  Tasted a lot more roasty than the smell. Also toasty nuts and light spices.  Medium body. Creamy texture. Soft carbonation. Long finish.

Aroma is malty, with hints of yeasty spice.  The spice flavors are very subtle; however, this begs the question, why even brew with ginger and cinnamon if you can't really detect any in the finished beer? Toasted malt notes complement a tangy hop flavor. Not too sweet, which I appreciate. The carbonation is medium-low, and the finish is smooth.  This is a balanced, drinkable beer. Nothing outstanding.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,gerite,3.5,"Poured from the 12 oz bottle into a crystal mug. This was part of the Sam Adams Winter Variety Pack, but not the best beer in the pack. Is says Lager, but it is really a Bock with some ginger and cinnamon added for extra flavor. It appeared a little paler than most bocks with about a finger of tan head that left some god lacing. The mouthfeel was light to medium with maderate carbonation. Even with the extra, there was not as much aroma and flavore as expected. Overall it is a pretty good Christmas beer but there are better ones in the Winter Variety Pack.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Schwarzwald,4.45,"This is a very nice lager. I would love to see them take it to a double and make it a little more deep.

Smell consists of orange, malt, various spices and a hint of caramel sweetness. I Taste consists of malt, spices and grain with a hint of orange, bread and some hops. Good blend of flavored and the spices add a kick to it. Medium bodied with high carbonation. Aftertaste is a creamy malty taste.  Overall, not a bad Bock; It has character and refreshing. Nothing to crazy in terms of tastes, but still a decent Christmas beer. Worth a try.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Nice formation of the head, but had weak retention, and very poor lacing.  I detected faint hops and a fresh ginger spices. Took another waft and caught more spices with my nose: cinnamon and a sweetness resembling oranges.  Slick mouthfeel with a medium body and level of carbonation. Quite malty/sweet with some nice hoppiness. Good mix of spices, some of the spicy notes in the background.  Overall enjoyable beer, not quite to the standards of winter warmers, but I think this represents a bock fairly well. Not a bad choice for a draught beer at a sports bar and it complemented my fish n chips very well.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

I don't have the most discriminate taste or smell, but the smell has an obvious aroma of spices. This blend of spices reminds me of winter. The spices do have a somewhat sour and nutty smell to them.  The taste of this beer reminds me even more of winter. To me, the taste is similar to that of an octoberfest, but the spices are much more noticeable. Once again, I can't put my finger on the exact spices in this, since I don't go around tasting random spices all day. But, I know the spices they use in this beer go very well in it, and that it gives it that winter flavor that makes this the perfect winter beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

A - deep amber in color, clear, slightly tan head of a finger hangs around for a minute, dissipates and leaves some streaky lacing on the glass  S - very subtle nose on this, hint of caramel malt  T - Minimal hop profile melting into a mixed bready malt and allspice. Quite subtle but pleasing.  M - solid carbonation on a medium body - a touch heavier than the regular lager.

Nice, but not exceptional holiday beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,ummswimmin,3.11,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass.  The taste of this beer is decent. Nothing really to write home about. They take a stock lager that gets the job done, and then they add some winter spicing... very lightly.  I recommend this beer to people that are newer to craft beer. They will probably like this winter lager.

The head is a tan color and is 1/2"" and dissapears to leave a thin ring around the glass. Lacing is minimal and slick on the glass.  The aroma is straight up medium lovibond malts and wheat, very one dimensional.  The flavor is somewhat more complex than the nose, but again with the medium malts leading the charge.  The mouthfeel is medium as is the carbination.  To me this is an average Bock, not bad but not great even if it is easy drinking. It would probably be good with about any food, but it wouldn't be great IMHO.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

S: Malty and spicy. Lots of ginger, cinnamon, coriander.  T: Decent bready toasted grain malt flavor, back by lots of spice. A little too much spice for me to really enjoy this with american family style food.  M: A little creamy, lighter carbonation, but seems a bit light for a bock.  O: Not a terrible offering from Sam Adams, but not their best. I won't be purchasing this again.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,PossumMunsen31,2.95,"Very mediocre offering from Samuel Adams. Pours dark with little head. Taste is avg. initially but gets better with a pretty solid finish.

Good carbonation and slight lacing after a half a finger of head (maybe the pour, glass was full) But the taste was surprisingly good! the mouthfeel and flavors were well balanced and complex enough to keep my interest past the bottom of my first one.

S: Bready, with a tinny sedimentary hint. Malted barley and yeast with a touch of spiciness, though not as much as one would expect from a ""Malt beverage brewed with spices.""  T: Malt-forward with a nice, mild spice in the mouth and a smooth, crisp finish. Flavors of oat bread, cinnamon and ginger dominate, with brandy notes and some tinny malts. The finish has a nice flavor, but the aftertaste leaves a somewhat hollow flavor in your mouth.  M: ""Macro""-feeling, in that it has a generic feel I mostly associate with mass-produced beers. It's smooth and crisp, and the spiciness adds a dance to the feel, but the overall texture is fairly bland and a touch watery in places.

Pleased with the taste and flavors.  M: Very clean and crisp. Just the right amount of carbonation. Great mouthfeel  O: Overall I think this is a great beer.

S- Has some roasted aroma to it probably stemming from the spices. That gives way to the malty characters and bready yeast notes. As it warms up I can pick out a touch of cinnamon floating in there. Also getting what smells like a hint of vanilla as well.  T- This one tastes almost just like it smells. Some malty flavors and subtle spices. I would say it has a caramel flavor in there but because of the spices it makes the caramel taste like it's burnt. The finish has a touch of bitterness to it left over from the hops.  M- little heavy on the carbonation but not by much. Has a good body to it. Creamy finish.  O- Not a huge lager fan but this one was nice.

Taste: Like the aromas, it has a sweet malt character, nice spices, a bit of caramel and light hops giving it a very slight bitterness.

A: Pours a half finger head of fair cream and thickness, but bad retention. Semitransparent copper colour.  Sm: Spice, caramel, amber hops, brown sugar, and a hint of molasses. A moderate strength aroma.  T: All the notes from the nose coalesce quite nicely in a balanced manner to produce the flavour. It's a bit dependent on its tingly sugar tone - which doesn't really work. The spice is quite nice. Slightly complex. The build is nice.  Mf: Smooth and wet, with some tingly business from the candy-ish brown sugar. Suits the flavour generally.  Dr: Quite drinkable and nice for the style. I enjoyed it on tap and I enjoy it now out of the bottle. I won't pursue this in future, but I do enjoy it. It's not exactly special, but it's enjoyable.

A pleasant orange zest comes through the malt and behind that a hint of spice from cinnamon, and ginger. Some bitterness from hops is added for a touch of balance but leans toward the sweet malty side.  M: Crisp medium body, slightly chewy and a dry finish.

35,101,CraftBeerTastic,3.18,Ba Review #90 Served On: 12/02/2011 Glassware: Pint Glass Labeled ABV: - Date/ Code: May 2011  This was in the 2011 Winter Classics mixed 12 pack.  Look: Poured a deep clear ruby copper color. Carbonation bubbles were steady. Head was a two finger creamy tan cap that formed a tin coating after a few moments.  Smell: I detected some ginger and a rich malts and a slight sour hoppiness. I got the feeling that Boston Beer may have used the base from their Boston Lager to make this. Regardless it had a very inviting nose.  Taste: Up front was a robust ginger and possibly cinnamon. Middle was of a Boston Lager sourness with a faint hop bite at the end. The finish was somewhat harsh with the spices reappearing. The Boston Lager quality dominated most of the palate. Aftertaste coated my mouth with a bitterness with hops drying out the mouth. Towards the end I noticed some booziness after the beer warmed up.  This is a nice winter offering. It offered a little more complexity than the Boston Lager. I also think the ABV is a little higher. Not a bad brew.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,StonedTrippin,3.55,"not crisp and cold and refreshing like most lagers, and not even fully seasonally applicable due to its average abv and dumbed down flavor profile. sam makes some epic beers, but this one is just average for me. it pours a light indian brown color into that funny sam adams glassware the use, good head. smells like a malt bomb, but tastes like a bit of cinnamon and clove spice, brown sugar, baked dessert, and even a light spruce element from the hops. its thick mouthfeel drags it down and sits in the gut a little bit, filling but without the needed winter buzz, carbonation is fine. not a good session lager for me. of the winter brews the cream stout and the scotch murder this one for my money. id say pass it by but its so damn common in the northeast, it probably cant be avoided. not a bad beer, but safe and boring by current holiday beer standards, although i get that its a mass appeal brew, real affordable, and marketed well. i do enjoy most of the sam seasonal beers, but this one is the weakest link...  edit: oddly enough for a large brewery like this, i feel like this one has gotten better over the years. i have enjoyed a few of them this season, eight years after my initial review, and i feel compelled to raise a few scores. seems drier and i can taste a bit of the lager yeast, a more balanced and complete beer, still safe, but better than i remember it being.  edit: perhaps newly reformulated in 2020, the box says it is, but maybe they started last year with this, this seems lighter, less malty, drier, maybe with some citrus on the back end. continual improvement somehow still in this seasonal classic. improved crispness and drinkability for me.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,airforbes1,3.53,"I'm doing a side-by-side comparison between this beer and Old Fezziwig.  This beer is lighter, being red-orange. The head is thin. To be honest, I can't make out the spices I'm smelling. All spice? It reminds me of a pumpkin ale...maybe a less aromatic version of DFH Punkin. The beer actually smells a bit boozy, which surprises me for a 5.5% beer.  All the other spiced winter beers I've tried are ales, so maybe I shouldn't be surprised with how....clean this beer tastes. It has a clean, malty beginning and middle and a mild generic spicy finish. The mouthfeel is thinner than I'd like.  This beer is OK. I prefer Old Fezziwig to it, however.

Pouring this beer lead to a one finger head which took awhile to dissipate. some of the head clinging to the side of the glass. its kind of a white-ish head; maybe less than white. the color of the body is dark orange-ish. some of the bubbles leftover from the head pool into the middle.  the smell is definitely of wheat (not necessarily in the Kansas City, MO brewed Boulevard wheat sense). a bit malty smell but I kind of pick up cinnamon as well but maybe Im confused into smelling cinnamon as malt. The malt and wheat smell come together for a very nice smell.  The taste confirms my smell of cinnamon as with the malty and wheat smell you can taste hints of cinnamon. The wheat smell is pretty subtle but still tastable with the malt. it after tasting and re-recognizing the smell its faintly Christmasy. These tastes other than wheat and malt are very faint keep in mind. the mouthfeel is very nice as its smooth and you can get it down pretty well (its not harsh like any steel reserve). mouthfeel is almost silky (or maybe Im overexaggerating). and...the song silver bells has returned to haunt my brain.  overally I really like this beer because its cold outside (at least in Nebraska it is) and this beer really does seem to go well with this kind of weather and the coming Christmas season (and Thanksgiving which has since passed). You can find it in stores now but only until spring comes which is awhile off right now.

Worth a try but nothing to go crazy over.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Random dots and streaks of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt/grain and a variety of winter spices. Not much going on in the smell department. Taste is of malt/grain, some citrus flavors, and a lot of different spices (cinnamon, clove, etc.). There is a slight bitterness from the spices with each sip but it quickly fades. This beer has a bubbly level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel.

35,101,schoolboy,4,"I've always enjoyed the SA winter collections. This one has long been one of the fun highlights. A nice, dark lager. It's very malty but has a nice aroma too (but mild, as per the style).  It's pretty in the glass and you don't get tired of it. I've bought these separately as well as in the collections and will continue to.  I miss some of the beers they've removed, like the fruity lambic.

35,101,RossCain,3.78,"From a bottle dated best by April 2012 into a becker pint glass  A: Pours a rustic, auburn brown with a large and foamy cappuccino colored head. The pillowy head lingers for a bit and clings desperately to the sides of the glass upon the initial pour.  S: Malt forward with dominant notes of rye bread kissed by spices. A pang of citrus from the orange zest can be picked up in the aroma, too.  T: Big and chewy malt flavors hit the palate upfront with some evident sweetness. The spices of ginger and lemon zest complement the taste profile in well-blended form. Finishes with nice, biscuity notes that fade slowly off of the palate. Satisfying.  M: Lighter bodied and somewhat thin for a bock with slightly prickly carbonation. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth as it tapers off into the finish but the spices add just the slightest of a drying touch. Overall refreshing but the mouthfeel leaves a bit to be desired.  O: A pretty solid beer and one that I would not pass up on draft in light of lesser options. This beer is a great value and something that could easily be shared among friends of varying degree of beer savvy. Not spectacular but certainly solid and easy to drink.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,emerge077,2.86,"Deep saturated copper color, jewel tone clarity, lasting foam and fine lacing crowning the edges. Retention is good, the skim doesn't break after the first few sips.  Sweet and malty smell, nuts, brown sugar, grains of paradise. Later it smells a bit bland and lagery.  First sip is a little vegetal and gross. Later sips aren't as off putting, but there's something there that just doesn't work. Some astringency in the mouthfeel, though light bodied and fairly smooth otherwise. Earthy vegetal flavor that reminds me of pumpkin or squash oddly enough. Some nutty malt character in there too, maybe some nutmeg? Overall the flavors don't coalesce well. Not too sure what to make of this, not really looking forward to finishing the glass either. edit: drank a 2nd one straight from the fridge a few weeks later, didn't seem as bad.

Not nearly as complex as I remember.  T: Notes of orange peel, cinnamon, ginger, dark bread, heavy cream, caramel, roasted nuts, and grassy, lemony hops wash across the palate. The finish is spicy and oddly prickly with notes of nuts, grassy hops, and spices.  M: Full bodied, dry, and bubbly. Has a ponderous, cumbersome feel to it that renders it less than drinkable.  O: The concept behind this beer is novel, but as a product, it doesn't come together (at least not this year).

No hops bitterness in there, but some malt tastes.  M- Lots of carbonation. Really light for the style. It was almost watery and went down fairly easy.  Overall, I was not impressed with this beer. It was very light in the mouthfeel category and the taste was just lacking.

Moderate lacing left as I drink.  Smell: Smells of malts, wheat, citrus, caramels, and a tad bit of spicyness.  Taste: Pretty nice. Dark malts and caramels, with citrus mixed in. There is also a notable buttery-ness to it. The end is grapefruit-like and a tad bit bitter.  Mouthfeel: Really nice. Pretty high carbonation but it's smooth and creamy.  Overall: Definitely recommended for cold days in the winter and fall. Delicious beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Rantingfury,3.83,"I poured from the bottle into my usual truncated conical glass. The head was a finger width of tan foam that faded to light lacing. A ruby amber hue in color, much like American iced tea, was evident when the glass was held to the light. the aroma starts off with a sweet caramel malt note, and then fades to a faint of spice and hops. The taste hit in two waves... The first was the malty bready taste, and faded to a nice spice/hop note. The after taste the ginger made a subtle but clear presence that was nice as well. Mouth feel was light to medium with a good bit of carbonation tickling my tongue. Over all I like this seasonal. The spices were a little on the light side in aroma and taste, but this beats over doing it by a wide margin. It's a good seasonal lager overall, but it's not outstanding to where I would go out of my way to buy it again.... Fortunately for this beer my regular store stocks it, so a few more six packs will be consumed.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

I remember some ginger in the nose. Good strength, smelled good.  T - Nice mix of roasty flavor with the spice profile. Neither one outweighs the other. The spices are not overdone.  MF - This is a medium-bodied beer, good amount of carbonation and and a nice finish.  O - Very nice on cold nights, I have nothing to compare it to yet in the style, but I liked this beer for sure.

Hops come faintly at the beginning, full of malt and spice in the middle. At the end, there's some metallic character, but it definitely tastes better than it smells.  Mouthfeel is a bit scratchy, coarse.  Not bad, but the most 'winter'-y part of this is the spice, and even for the price point, most other winter seasonals are better.

S: A little caramel with some straw overtones.  T: Light caramel, some peppery spice, straw on the finish. Caramel lingers on the aftertaste. Towards the end of the glass, some leather joins the finish.  M: Medium light body, good creamy feel.  O: Nothing exceptional, but quite solid.

There appears to be a very small amount of carbonation.  S: Toasted malts are the backbone for the aroma. They are complemented by a sort of earthy/grassy smell along with a touch of sweet caramel and a light hop profile.  T: As in the aroma, the taste is mostly comprised of the toasted malts. The grassy aspect again makes its presence known, though only slightly.  M: Pretty much what you'd expect from a dark lager. It has a medium body along with a feel that isn't overly lively and is relatively smooth.  O: I wasn't overly impressed with this one.

Good retention and lacing, with lively, tight carbonation bubbles.  Smell: Slightly sweet and malty. Not a necessarily robust smell.  Taste: Malty with a nip of cinnamon and ginger at the back end. Plum and caramel fills the middle and blends well with the malt and spice.  Mouthfeel: Dexterous in a very Sam Adams kind of way. Well carbonated finish pairs with the spices to give a nice tang without lasting dryness.  Overall: A re-review of my first review on BA.

Just a hint of spiciness, at least partly from the hops. Watery. Very flimsy body, I wouldn't even call it ""light"". No kudos for this one, Samuel Adams.

Pours a decent head. Scents of some toasty winter spices, ie cinnamon and nutmeg. Smells decently. Very thin, has been totally dumbed from original recipe. The flavors are one of a true winter warmer but not accentuated properly.  This beer used to be a 7% ACTUAL wheat bock with a thick body, and a hearty, meaty flavor to it.

35,101,Sorvahr,3.83,"Purchased from a Wal-Mart in Memphis, TN for $8.50. I had had this beer last year and remembered it was pretty good, so I decided to get a six-pack of it for a review. I'm always annoyed by the whole seasonal brew concept--if a beer's worth selling, it's worth selling year round, not for only a few months out of the year. And this beer certainly is; I'd drink it any season. Poured into a New Belgium snifter glass.  A: Pours a deep, clear garnet, one of the reddest beers I've ever seen. The off-white head came up to one finger but has excellent retention. Lacing is exceptional though, going all the way down the glass and quite persistent. It's quite impressive to see a whole sheet of froth appear on the glass and break up into lines and segments that slowly slide down the side.  S: It has a real malty aroma to it, you can smell the cinnamon and spices a bit but the bock malts are the primary smell. Very appetizing.  T: Definitely one of the richest Samuel Adams beers available here (the really fancy ones like the Double Bock cannot be found in Memphis). Powerful, bready malts are the first thing that comes up on the palate, followed by the tingle of the various added spices. The beer is hoppy but not so much as to throw off the balance of the beer and overwhelm the malts that are the primary attraction here. It's sort of like the Boston Lager but bigger, bolder, and with a warming effect from the additional ingredients. The spices begin to come to the fore as the beer warms up, bringing an almost ""liquid pastry"" quality to the taste. The finish is a lot like chocolate but with yeast undertones. All the various flavors seem to have been balanced in just the right amounts.  M: Thick for an inexpensive beer but not too heavy as to be un-sessionable. The spices impart a warm, tingling quality and the beer lingers on the palate for some time.  O: For less than $10, it's hard to get better than this. This is a very good beer that is masterfully balanced and uses its additives well. Recommended.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,blackcompg,3.83,"Poured from their winter sampler into my 12oz beer glass...  Appearance - Poured a finger of tight, lite orange eggshell head, color of the beer is a beautiful translucent red-amber.  Smell - Smell is coriander, touch of orange citrus, toasty bread, touch of vanilla and carmel.  Taste - Starts with a nice vanilla carmel, then fresh wheat bread. At the center there is a burst of semi-sweet orange and coriander spice, and minerals at the sides of the tongue. As the sip finishes I get a touch of grassy hops, drying orange peel and some pumpernickel breadcrust. There are tiny pockets of spiced carmel in the corners of the mouth.  Mouthfeel - Lite to medium mouthfeel, medium carb really gives a nice crispness, and has a slightly dry finish, really nice actually.  Overall - I was really impressed with this beer, pleasantly surprised. Very flavorful, complex and very well balanced, and at 5.5% ABV this is extremely sessionable.

35,101,stakem,3.88,"Thanks to Eric for gifting me with one of these to try. Poured into a matching SA sensory glass, this brew appears a clear amber color with a finger of off-white froth across the top. A constant stream of carbonation rises to the surface and supports the creamy topping that resides. As it slowly recedes, it leaves patches of lacework sticking to the glass.  The smell of this brew initially has some malty sweetness faintly of caramel with some fresh noble hop character that comes across a bit herbal with a slight metallic touch. More sniffs reveal a spiced inclusion of cinnamon and something along the lines of orange peel with the faintest accent of something along the lines of coriander.  The taste of this brew immediately gives a nod in the direction of the cinnamon and orange peel that was noted in the aroma. However, it is a bit more earthy almost like nutmeg is also included and the orange peel has a brightness about it more so than the typical orange rind character, not quite coriander but sort of. The toasty malt inclusion tastes more like toffee than the caramel that was indicated in the aroma. The hops are present with a mild herbal quality that provide enough contrasting bitterness to keep the sweetness of the malt in check.  This is a medium bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. The sensory glass really gives the visual perception of this looking over-carbonated from the constant stream of bubbles but it is pleasantly modest and not overdone in the feel. The finish is quite crisp and while the spices are very upfront and noticeable, they are not overdone. This was a refreshing spiced brew that is a well done example of a spiced winter offering, I wouldn't mind having this again.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

The spicing is mild, evenly spread between ginger, cinnamon and orange peel. There is the clean flavor of lager yeast fermentation.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is medium-heavy.  Overall Impression: Overall I find this a very well executed winter lager. It is very good bock with just enough spicing to enhance the beer without overpowering the underlying flavor of the beer.

Little to no off-white head and leaves minimal lacing. Great beer.

35,101,BEERMILER12,3.7,"A: Pours a golden orange color with about a fingers worth of slightly off-white head  S: Malty with a touch of spice. Orange peel, cinnamon, and some candied ginger mostly, with maybe something else  T: This tastes pretty much like Boston Lager with some spices added. Some wheat also, which is also different from the BL  M: Medium bodied with plenty of carbonation  O: Certainly not the best winter seasonal I've had, but far from the worst. Some of their other 'seasonals' from the mixed pack work better IMO, but that's up to BBC. Still a solid beer though",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,rangerred,3.66,"Poured into a pint glass.  Appearance is a clear dark amber with about one finger of head that is slow to fade.  Smells sweet with some spice and bready malt. Not bad.  Taste begins with some spice that fades to a caramel, bready maltiness. There is a sweetness throughout but it does not become cloying. It is well balanced.  Overall I really enjoy this beer and look forward to it every year. Like many Sam Adams beers it has great flavor and is easy to drink several in one sitting.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,gregb13,3.5,"Pours a nice looking reddish amber. Very thin head and light lacing. Smells a little sweet, malty, some pie spices and what I could swear is pumpkin (this smells very similar to their Pumpkin Ale). Taste follows the nose. I definitely get some pumpkin.

35,101,Jesse13713,3.04,"I remember enjoying this quite a bit last year. Let's see if this year is the same story.  Appearance - A light, watery root-beer like brown that is lightly carbonated. Slightly clumpy dirtied clouds that linger on top of the brew. Transparent and fresh-looking.  Smell - There is definitely some noticeable malt in the aroma. A bit of barley and bread notes as well. Faint spice.  Taste - More watered down than I remember, but there's definitely some heavy malt characteristic. I get the very faintest hit of spice in the aftertaste. Pretty bland, actually.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability - I could definitely drink quite a bit of this, but it just isn't that special. I remember it being better last year. It's holiday properties are weak and dwindling at best. It also exceptionally dry. It's an alright bock/lager, but it's just sort of average.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

T - Malty first and foremost. The other things from the nose are quite muted. A lot of neutral malt flavor. I remember this having more going on. Oh well.  M - medium-thin bodied, smooth, every so slightly drying.  O - this is fine, not great. The nose is quite good and would be much appreciated also on the tongue, but it's not there.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

I can definetly smell the spices in it, it smells like Christmas in a bottle  Tastes really good not overpowering just the right amount of flavor and taste to enjoy the beer.

I would definetly get this again, and I would recommend it to beer drinkers everywhere.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,BeerResearcher,4,"Served in a standard pint glass. It pours a dark ruby-hued amber color with a solid 2"" beige head and plenty of web and trailing lacing. The first smell is sweet wet malt and nut bread. A light whiff of mixed fruit cup with a hint of nutmeg and peppery spice follows. If there was a liquid bock honey granola bar, this would be the recipe, less a mild taste of white rum and raisins. A bit of lime-like citrus taste pulls through in the aftertaste. All in all, a solid Bock...not spectacular...but a solid brew.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Some orange peel and lots of spice. Ginger it seems. Very bitter...very drying...very spicy.  M: Leaves a very dry taste in the mouth. This is rather offputting to me.

35,101,paxchristi,3.35,"Taken from notes taken from winter 2010. Poured from bottle into stein.  Appearance: Dark brown color with some orange and/or ruby hues. Had frothy head that eventually hung back onto side of glass and eventually settling into film on the top.  Smell: Light aroma. Caramel malts, a bit of brown sugar and orange peel.  Taste/Mouth: Nose justifies the taste. Smooth and has a nice sweet finish to it that is slightly accented by the orange spices-- probably some clove and/or coriander in there somewhere.  Overall: You know, I remember getting this during the winter for several years from 2003-2008, and I remember not only this being way better, but I remember there being some noble hops, a warmer experience in the mouthfeel, and it having quite a bit more body to it. Not only that, but I remember being overwhelmed with suds. Damn...bit let down. Going to try in on-tap this winter and review it again.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,ChrisCage,3.56,"A- Pours a nutty brown color with an ever so slight haze to it. As for head, there isn't really any...starting out with about a fingers' worth, but quickly settling to nothingness. The carbonation appears to be fine and lazy looking, and as for the lacing, there really isn't much of anything. If it weren't for the color, this wouldn't look like anything of substance!!  S- The aromas are quite pleasant, with orange zest coming right up front, some baking spices and a blend of sweet malt mixed with some roasted darker varieties. There is a root beer like quality in the smell that I quite like....the finish really has no bitterness to speak of either.  T- A little bit of spice, blended in with toasted semi-sweet malt give this a unique flavor....it's rich yet mild, with Earthy tones primarily and towards the end, the orange zest pops up again, leaving the palate with a soft tartness. Not bad....not bad...just not great tasting IMO.  M- I'd put this more on the medium-lite end of the spectrum as far as body goes. I also find the sweetness to be a little bit on the cloying side as well, but this is a Winter beer and probably should be a little sweet and sticky...  O- Not a bad beer, but not my favorite. I wouldn't go out of my way for this one again, but wouldn't refuse it either....now I know I'm drinking this a bit past it's prime but I had this when I first bought the sampler pack in Winter 2010 and this wasn't really any different. I'm guessing this is standard for the style....I just couldn't do more than a bottle of this in a sitting...oh well!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,ktrillionaire,4,"(From backlog.) On-tap at Carraba's. Looking at the pour, it seems just like Boston Lager: bronze liquid with a smallish ecru cap, and radiant translucence. There is a small amount of hop character in the nose, which plays out as fruity-floral and spicy on the palate, atop a dry and biscuity malt base. Again, I see very little difference between this and Boston Lager. Nice feel, very crisp. Easy drinking overall, although I prefer BBCSABL over BBCSAWL.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,chinchill,3.93,"2010/11 release served in a pint glass. Small amount of sediment added (recommended) mid-tasting. Revisited with 2019 release which had no sediment.  Pours a lovely clear reddish mahogany with a 1 finger tan head that has moderate retention.  Pleasing but mild (weak) malty and spicy aroma. Flavor - Nice medium roasted malt flavor with detectable but rather subtle added flavor from spices, especially orange peel. [""Subtly spiced with cinnamon, orange peel and ginger""] ... Better too little than too much, IMO. Tastes more like Sam Adams Lager than expected. Good finish with spices coming more to the fore at the end.  M - cinnamon and ginger combine to produce a mild spice 'bite' on the tongue.  O - a nice variation for fans of Sam Adams Lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Tight bubbles. Orangish amber color. Very clear.  Flavor: Earthy flavors dominate. Cinnamon in background. Caramel sugary sweetness. Low bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy. Medium mouthfeel.  Overall: Great mouthfeel. Spices seem muddied. This may be because of age. A good balanced beer.

35,101,Knapp85,3.53,"The Winter Lager pours out as a slightly hazy looking brown color with a generous tan colored head on top. The aromas of some wintery spices, malts and some hops are on the nose. The taste is a little spicy but balanced enough that you can get all the flavors at different times. The mouthfeel is carbonated enough to make the mouth tingle but smooth enough to drink several if one chooses too. It's a pretty good brew in my opinion I love when the Winter season falls because it's always great to have that first Sam Adams Seasonal of that time of year.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Bockrules,3.5,"Poured from the bottle into a mug  A - Pours a copper-to-dark amber with tinges of orange on the outside of the glass. Two-finger, fluffy dark tan head with moderate carbonation. Maybe it's the glass, but it seems slightly hazzy. Head diminishes quickly and is gone about 1/4 down the glass. Virtually no lacing.  S - Very sweet malt and orange zest smell upon opening the bottle. This becomes much less pungent in the mug. Maybe this beer would benefit from a different glass.  T - Orange, malt and cinnamon flavors upfront. Moving past the front of the tongue, the orange flavors become more subdued and the malt flavor dominates, but there is an awkward bitter flavor lurking in the background... The finish is a smooth transition from the body, but as the sweet and malty notes fade, that out of place bitter flavor makes another entrance.  M - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Suits the style well enough.  First, 5.5% is a bit weak-sauce for a bock. This can be summarized as initially exciting me, and then failing. The smell reminded me of cooking Christmas deserts upon opening the bottle, but once in the class hardly anything was detectable over the malt smell. Finally, initially the taste was reminiscent of mulled cider, but the body and finish were unimpressive and then that awkward flavor snuck in... Overall an alright Bock, that flopped.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,gkunkle,4.18,"Reviewed from notes.  Had this on tap at the little taproom in the Spokane Airport. It was poured into a shaker pint, beer was a dark brown with a slight redish hint, sort of like barkdust (I say that in the most positive way) I cannot report accurately on the head as the server seemed to quickly dismiss it into the sink. (dummy) Due to the lacking head, I can only describe the head as having properties of darkish sweet malts and some spices. The taste was quite impressive to me. Taste is of dark malts as well as a slight wheat flavor, there are also elements of spices, very good. Mouthfeel is nice, carbonation is refreshing. Overall this is a great beer, I'll definitely be buying a 6 pack of this when winter rolls around.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

The citrus smell is definately orange and there is also a caramel taste with grainy and earthy qualities. Slightly alcoholic.  M- Dry and heavy but nice for a winter beer. light carbonation.

35,101,CHickman,3.34,"Pours hazy amber orange in color with a massive 2 finger foamy tan head that lasted a long time and faded very slowly, leaving decent creamy lacing; an impressive head out of the bottle.  Smells of herbs, malt, light toasted grains, faint brown sugar and spices - a pretty non-descript nose and much mellower and lighter than I expected.  Tastes of malt, herbs, pine cone, light toasted grains, brown sugar, grass, hay or other earthy notes, light caramel, pepper and other spices, some piney or floral hops, orange peel and/or coriander, and a funky yeast finish that trails off dry with some spices like cinnamon or allspice. Definitely tastes like a winter beer, but like the nose, the flavor is much more timid than I expected.  Mouthfeel was creamy and smooth, yet somehow crisp which makes sense considering the high fizzy carbonation and medium body, and this went down easier than a lot of other winter ""spiced"" beers.  I wouldn't buy a 6 pack of this beer, but it's a nice change of pace and a decent enough beer to enjoy in the Sam Adams Winter Pack. A good beer to sample, but not one that I'd add to my list of regulars and definitely not a session beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Can drink quickly...but would rather not. Summary: This is an above average beer. I gave it 7.6/10, or C. I'm a little disappointed in this beer. It's a seasonal beer, so I was expecting something special...a higher alcohol content, some holiday spiciness, or that feeling of warmth...instead I got a beer that tastes slightly better than the average winter beer.

It poured with a finger high dense beige head that died down and left some lacing on the surface. S: The smell is quite spicy and has aromas of cinnamon and ginger along with notes of orange peel. T: The initial taste has some brief hints of caramel and malty sweetness but quickly transitions to flavors that share similarities with the aroma. M: It feels medium-bodied and smooth on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation. The finish has a bit of dryness from the spices and a slight amount of warming from the alcohol. O: The relatively light body of this beer could make it one that's very easy to drink for the style but there's no way that I could have more than one of these in a sitting given all of the spices.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

I can't get past a very strange soapy sweet smell. At least it's not overpowering.  Very thick malt of taste with a good sugary bread finish. Mildly hoppy but still has that really strange soap character. Luckily this odd soapyness is kind of sweet and seems to hide things and make the beer pleasant.

35,101,dalimsta,3.58,"Following up on my last review of this beer (on tap)--what a huge disappointment!  - Not as brilliantly colored - Flavor is much, much more subdued. The bold, complex flavor I'd experienced before changed to a pretty ordinary lager with a bit of dry spice. Also tasted a bit watery, which was certainly not true of my first few pints. - Pretty much the same mouthfeel, though again maybe a little more watery. - Goes down easily, but leaves an odd dry sensation (likely the spice) that doesn't really demand a second bottle.  This isn't a bad beer at all, and I still like it, but from the bottle it seriously pales in comparison with the draft version. One of my friends suggested that they may have come from two sources, and that the Boston brewery typically puts out better batches than the PA one.

35,101,devilben02,2.64,"Pours a rich, deep reddish-amber color, with a thick, creamy sand-colored head that clings to the side of the glass. The aroma is largely just a thin graininess, but there are subtle notes of sweet malts and a dull earthy hop presence underneath. The flavor is more defined, with a sweet caramel malt base contrasted by a bit of earthy, peppery hops, but it all just seems a bit stale. The added spices are not distinct themselves, but they instead build on the dull earthiness of the hops. The mouthfeel is fine, but it doesn't do anything to prop up the dull, dreary flavor profile. Overall, I finished every bottle of this beer from the winter sampler pack, but I didn't particularly enjoy them.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,DrewKid4,3.97,"A: Pours a dark caramel amber. Small frizzy white head.  S: Caramel, cinnamon, slight nutmeg, and pepper. Slight citrus and roasted malts.  T: Citrus and cinnamon. Slight malts and hops present.  M: Very smooth and well balanced. All of the above flavors counter each other to make it smoother than expected.  D: Very drinkable for a winter beer. Good for friends and the Beer Advocate.  I do have to say that I believe they changed their recipe along with their more obvious change of label. I actually prefer the past Winter Lagers because it really did taste more like a winter warmer or heavier bock.

Seems like clove may be one of the spices. Hops are not overpowering.

35,101,biboergosum,3.63,"355ml bottle. Here in Canada, for some continuing reason, we get the Swedish and English label info - not sure why that is, but it certainly is a welcome sight to see these 6-packs at this time of year.  This beer pours a clear, medium burnt amber colour, with two fingers of foamy ecru head, which leaves a nice Swiss cheese spectrum of lace around the glass as it readily recedes.  It smells of mild toasted caramel malt, ginger spice, a bit of orange citrus, and an underlying layer of earthy noble hops. The taste is ginger and clove inflected bready caramel malt, some other black pepper-esque spice, and more nondescript earthy hops.  Any carbonation is quite mild, the body a sure medium-light in weight, and yet a tad astringent – the heretofore understated hops and emboldened alcohol equally responsible. It finishes mostly sweet, and with that persistent edgy, simmering spice bitterness.  A decent, moderately spiced lager, evoking memories of holiday seasons past, and worthy of some love when you don’t want to drink something all that heavy in your craft beer pursuits in the current one.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,fdw3,4,Pours a dark amber with an off-white that fades relatively quickly and leaves little lacing. Smells of sweet roasted malts with notes of spices and faint citrus. Taste is well-balanced with a subdued sweetness from the roasted malts with spices (cinnamon maybe?) sitting in the background. Body is moderately full and relatively smooth with moderate carbonation.  A solid offering from Sam Adams that's perfect for warming up when it's cold outside. I will come back to this one when it's on tap and feel comfortable recommending it to fans of the style -- very good!,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,nickthetick,3.13,"A: pours a mahogany into an American shaker glass with a finger of dirty white head that dissipates at a moderate rate and leaves spotted lacing.  S: subdued caramels and christmas spices.  T: nice caramel and equally moderate malts, conservative use of spices. A little cinnamon baked apple lingers.  MF: medium body, moderate effervescence and fairly refreshing.  D: this represents a good middle of the road bock/christmas beer. I'll defiantly keep buying the mixed 12s and keep drinking these, but wouldn't pass the opportunity to cook with them.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,CuriousMonk,3.2,"From winter brew tasting notes (2010): Pours a clear copper color with a half inch of head. The aroma is a blend of cereal malt, cardamom, nutmeg and lemon rind. The taste is very similar to the aroma with the addition of some cinnamon, ginger and caramel malt flavors.The mouthfeel is low-to-medium bodied with strong carbonation and a dry, spicy finish. It's a bit over spiced for my tastes and definitely could have used a stronger ABV to hold it all together.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,biegaman,3.68,"Sam Adams Winter Ale has a handsome and blushing chestnut colour with golden undertones. It also has irreproachable clarity, razor-sharp tawny highlights and a soapy, all-engrossing crown - is there anything it doesn't have? Well, lacing for one. But otherwise, no, that's about it.  The aroma is evidence of a clever recipe and a responsible brewer. Any use of spices can be disastrous if proper restraint is not exercised. None of the additional ingredients would necessarily be noticeable if you weren't already tipped off. That said, conspicuous or inconspicuous, you can readily appreciate their zesty, savory contributions.  Ginger is the first thing to hit the senses. Its zestfully sharp piquancy is the aromatic equivalent of caffeine and awakens the palate before the savory sweep of cinnamon and citrusy splash ensue soon after. Bitterness is needlessly assertive, but the toasty, bready caramel malts acquiesce none and respond with a spongy, toffee-ish flavour.  All technicalities aside (this is lagered and thus not strictly speaking an ale), this has a number of ale-like elements, specifically and especially the yeasty by products. A stinging spice (flavoured like clove, similar in character to turmeric) is drying and faintly peppery where as esters, all resembling one bruised fruit or another, linger in the aftertaste.  From what I'm told, Samuel Adams Winter Lager was a once stupefying seasonal that has been gradually toned down over the years. While my first time trying it was only five years ago, I could then - and still do now - draw comparisons to a Belgian dubbel or German weizenbock which alone grants it more character than most beers brewed on a similar scale. In other words, no matter how good it might have once been, it's still pretty good now.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,lsrose,3.89,This beer pours a beautiful head. I have had a lot of this one from bottles this winter and have wanted to try it on tap but haven't yet. It has some good taste of spices and hops.

Smell: I smell a little ginger, caramel, and citrus. This beer has a really good smell that makes it appealing.  Taste: It has a flavorful rich flavor. It has quite a bit of Christmas spices that I pick up such as cinnamon and clove. It has a lingering taste of hops at the end.  Mouthfeel: It has a medium amount of carbonation and body that sits and goes down smooth. It has a creamy texture that leaves a sweetness in the mouth.  Drinkability: Very good beer that I would drink again. The flavors work well together and it is not too heavy. Looking forward to my next one.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Jdmpolk,3.48,"A- Golden reddish color, almost reddish brown. White and slightly tan head. Little lacing left on the glass.  S- Initially a very strong citrus hop aroma, however after the head dissipated the toasted malt becomes more prevalent although there is a tug of war going on between the two.  T- A nice dryness persists through the entire tasting. Slight bitterness on the back end lets you know the hops are still around. The middle has a malty almost caramel sweetness to it. A hint of fruit is also mingled with the caramel sweetness exhibited in slightly cherry or banana flavor.  M- Very light, a bitterness streaks down the middle of your tongue, but it lasts only a minute leaving a pleasant after taste.  D- Despite the off taste and smell the other factors come together to make a nice beer to drink.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

I smelled mostly toasted caramel malt with a hint of gingerbread.  The flavor consists of cinnamon bread, orange, ginger, just a hint of bitterness.

Taste - good tasting beer, you can taste the malts followed with some caramel and sweetness near the end. not much bitterness.  Mouthfeel - there are some added richness and deeper taste to this, this is a good beer. the palette is filled and a added amount of bitterness near the end.

35,101,Wegomlegging,2.65,"Clear brown pour with nice head. Scents of very light spice and cherry. Aside from the light sweetness and hint of spice, this was watery in flavor in that there was not much. Mouthfeel was pretty standard, as was drinkability.

35,101,JohnnyBarman,3.53,"Six pack picked up at the LCBO - consumed with vigor during this week's snowstorm. Figured it was appropriate...  Poured into a nonic glass. A nice amber-copper brew, which leaves behind an inch of off white head that settles into a ring. A few flecks of lacing here and there. Looks like your basic English pale ale or winter warmer.  The nose is nice, but incredibly subtle. Malt, caramel, cherry, nutmeg, a few other spices here and there.  Tastes malty, rich, a decent spice profile, with smoke, caramel, clove/nutmeg and dark caramel. Finishes spicy with a good blast of pepper. Drinkable, not something I'd want on a regular basis, but certainly good for the evening.  Nothing terribly exciting, but pretty good for a craft brewery with as big a presence as Sam Adams. Something I'm sure would go well with many different folks at the holidays / to ward off the chill.

35,101,GarthDanielson,3.1,"Poured on-tap at the Rainforest Cafe in Ontario, CA. The beer was poured into a pint glass, and served WAY too cold, likely due to the fact that they have all the taps set-up for BMC. I let this one sit for quite some time to adjust the temp a bit, but I'll still likely try it again some time in case the review needs adjusting.  The beer was a great, deep amber-red color, with no head. The beer was vibrant and crystal in appearance. Smells of sweet malt, with a hint of hops. The beer had flavors of caramel and old world fruit sweetness (fig and date), with toasty characteristics. Very crisp finish, with a nice, smooth, darkly sweet, fruity aftertaste.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Served in my SA perfect pint glass.  This is a dark reddish (nearly purple!) brown. Nice 2 finger tan head-- good retention early, but after a few sips, nothing is left. Some small chunks of lacing are left behind.  The smell holds big malts. Some Ginger and cinnamon come up too. Not bad. No notice of hops.  Taste is sweet. Caramel malts and toffee notes hit first. The sweetness dries out with some toffee and coffee notes-- very mild bitterness. Still not a big hop presence: perhaps a slight noble hop spice?  Body is solid for a bock-- medium full with good carbonation.  This is the best ofthe winter pack so far. I will happily drink this one again!

35,101,peensteen,3.32,"Pours a dark ruby red colour, 1/4 inch head that vanished almost immediately with no retention or lacing at all. Aromas of spicy malt, bitter hop and faint alcohol round out the nose. Palate is spicy with a good malt presence, dry hop notes and a semi sweet finish. Medium mouthfeel that is quite watery and does not linger.

35,101,TheHammer,3.46,"Appearance: Well the body is a beautiful blood red with amazing clarity and steady carbonation. The down side though is that is poured with less the a finger of head that immediately vanished and didn't lace whatsoever.  Smell: Has a bit of a ginger, cherry and cinnamon smell with a bit of a sweet malt backing. Pretty much what I would expect for the holiday season. Didn't require much warming to kick into high gear.  Taste: Sweet and spicy and it's like drinking mild liquid gingerbread. A mild caramel malts starts us out with touches of cinnamon. The sweet spicing then builds as ginger, nutmeg and fruity notes of orange and cherry come forward and end with a slightly dry alcohol kick to end it.  Mouthfeel: Well points get deducted for the lack of head, and the it does leave a bit too much of a dry aftertaste. The carbonation is done well and it builds up to a crescendo fairly well.The aftertaste though is the alcohol drowning out the underlying spice.  Drinkability: Sure, I could have a couple of these but really this one is seasonal for a reason. A decent desert beer, but I think this would go good with Turkey. It's medium light and sits down well enough.  Final Thoughts: All in all a nice change of pace but nothing to write home about. Sam Adams has impressed me enough to wish they had more of a presence at the LCBO, and sincerely wish they could get a mix six pack up here. I really ought to make a trip out to Boston one of these days.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Ample carbonation is apparent.  S: Malt, cinnamon, and slight orange,  T: Starts with strong orange and nice cinnamon. Sweet malt with slight roast takes over in the middle and rides all the way until the finish. Smoke conquers the finish, some of the alcohol is present, and a some orange zest as well.  M: Medium-body with slight cream and a crisper finish.  D: This beer does not have a very high abv, and it is not extremely strong.  Overall: Not a bad seasonal offer. It is pretty balanced, not sweet, and the finish is not cloying. However, there are much better seasonal offerings. To be honest, if you want a winter beer that is not as heavy and flavor loaded, but still delivers some interesting taste, this beer is for you.

Lively carbonation.  Smell: A lot of malt sweetness. Caramel, toffee. Subtle hints of ginger spiciness and cocoa.  Taste: Caramel sweetness with some bready notes. There is a definite spiceness from the ginger (especially as it warms) and just a touch of bitter orange peel in the finish, but I'm struggling to find the cinnamon that the bottle describes. Nice sweetness that lingers on the tounge. Not much for hops, just a little bitterness to balance the malt.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied. A somewhat dry finish with a tiny bite on the tounge from the carbonation.  Drinkability: I don't really like a lot of Sam Adams beer, but this is one of the few that I really enjoy.

S- Very minimal aroma, just a whiff of yeast and malt. Was hard to pick this out, I've never had a beer with such a lack of aroma before.  T- Thankfully the taste doesn't follow the nose. Caramel and spice hit the palate first, twangs of ginger and cinnamon followed by some heat from alcohol. Had to check the label again to make sure that it said this was a lager, much more flavor that what I was expecting, both for a lager and after the nose. Finish is dry and slightly sweet some more caramel and a hint of hop bitterness.  M- Medium in body and in carbonation. Clean and crisp in the mouth like a lager should be, but with a lot more flavor.  D- Very drinkable, the 5.5% ABV make it a session candidate .  Weird beer, not at all what was expected, no aroma, way more flavor than a lager usually has, classified as a bock not a winter warmer, and strangely flavored not in a bad way though.

The nose is fairly subdued - had to take several deep inhales to describe the aroma.  I suppose the taste follows the smell, but man, with all the ads claiming travel to other countries, 'looking out for exotic ingredients', there's not much going on here. Some sweetbread malts along with a note of slightly astringent bread crust. Just a faint touch of candied ginger, some orange, and a sprinkle of cinnamon.

I don't think they would complain today since this beer still has the same flavor profile it once had, but the intensity of those flavors have been dialed down. It's still a decent beer, though.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,jeffthecheff,3.6,"Amber red color with okay clarity. Head is thick and foamy from a straight pour.  The most prominent aroma is ginger spices, which is behind a full, toasty, malt body. Smells like a gingerbread cookie. Cinnamon is definitely there too, with a touch of citrus. There is enough malt in the nose to balance the spices so that it doesn't smell like a ""spiced"" beer.  Flavor is spicy and full with caramel flavors, a touch of citrus, and some puckering cinnamon. The body is full, maybe too full, with moderate carbonation. The finish is a bit cloying which knocks a few points off, but otherwise this is a decent seasonal that I don't mind in the mixed pack.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

S- slight sweetness up front, malt, citrusy fruits, a bit of hops, slight holiday spice aroma (cinnamon, nutmeg-ish)  T-Citrus, cinnamon, ginger, hops  M -Moderate carbonation, medium bodied, dry finish  D -Very high! All the flavors worked well together along with the right amount of carbonation. I enjoyed the first 22 oz. bottle by the fireplace, it's a cold & snowy evening, the perfect night for a winter brew.  Note: I enjoyed a second bottle a bit later with a peppercorn spiced pork tenderloin, baked potato and steamed green beans....it paired well with the pork and all of the sides!

Taste is the expected spicy, sweet, and bready. Not much going on here, but it ends pleasantly with a spice and herbal hop zing.  Mouthfeel is a bit too carb.'ed, but a nice finish. Easy drinking, but resins soon build on palate.  Drinkability is average for style. It's somewhat refreshing and tasty, but nothing to write home about.  Impression: Like most of SA beers it is not outstanding and has no major flaws. For the price it's okay. Recommended only if you're crazy for this style.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Good amount of caramel character. Not picking up very much in the way of spices. Perhaps nutmeg & a little coriander.  M - Full bodied enough. Slightly more viscous than I would have expected.  D - An enjoyable offering. I've had 4 of 6 and looking forward to to the other two.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

35,101,DavoleBomb,2.83,"Poured into a weizen glass as this is apparently a weizenbock.  3.0 A: If this is a weizenbock, I don't know why it's filtered. Clear orange amber color. Half a finger of frothy beige head with poor retention and just a touch of lacing.  2.5 S: Not really too appetizing. A weird mixture of caramel, clove yeastiness, wintry spiciness, and a touch of garbage. Some toasted malts, grassy hops. Can't say I like this a whole lot.  3.0 T: Toasty malts, wheaty, some hints of spiciness. Again, grassy hops and maybe a bit earthy as well. Fairly boring and a bit lacking in flavor. Not the worst option in a pinch (from personal experience), but not something I'd like to drink often.  3.5 M: Lighter medium body. Aggressive weizenbock level carbonation. Could be creamier and a bit smoother, but okay.  2.5 D: Having had several of these in a night, I can say it's not the most drinkable.

Reason being we had to catch the end of the wild card game where Marshawn Lynch went into beast mode to beat the Saints. Context is important for beers, so this one hit at perfectly the right time.  It's smooth, filtered amber body sits underneath a tiny head that retains with great lacing. I'm sure the barkeep could have given me more head on it - the appearance is certainly a strong point. There's not much more than malts by way of smell, but those malts come out strongly in the taste. Brilliantly sweet and subdued at the same time, this brew is just strong enough in flavor and alcohol to warm up a winter afternoon.  It's an easy taste with a balance of hops that favors the malts and lets them shine, Sam Adams Winter Lager is a bock for the cold weather. And a highly drinkable one at that.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Not powerful, but present. It's moderately hopped with a bittering hop. The malt doesn't seem to have as much of an effect on the flavor, but I would put it as on the sweeter side.  The lasting flavor is a mix of bitter hops and ginger, followed by sweet, probably from the malt.  I liked this beer. A solid, but not too powerful flavor. This could definitely be a session beer.

There was not much smell to speak of with this beer. Maybe could pick up some strained hops. Taste was fair, had some bitterness to it but was not overwhelming and nothing stood out.

Smell - Very little smell at all. Not even enough to get a bearing on its hop vs. malt levels.  Taste and Mouthfeel - bitter taste but doesn't seem to come from hops. It lingers more toward the back upper part of the palate than on the tongue. Maybe some of the ginger is noticeable. Texture is pretty well-balanced.  Drinkability - Somewhat bland and tasteless.

Lacing seems to retain.  S - Smells a bit like a Boston Lager, with more to offer. Cinnamon and nutmeg deep within the nose. Dark malts seem to be present, along with a hoppy flavor. The best word to describe the aroma would probably be spicy.  T - Basic and pleasantly smooth. Doesn't have too much going on, which is in most cases a good thing. Cinnamon notes are followed by a sweet bitterness.  M - Creamy, smooth, chewy. Nothing much bad about the mouthfeel.  D - Easily drinkable. I enjoy the smoothness of this beer. I'm enjoying one during a cold night in January and its serving its purpose very well.  A very pleasant beer to enjoy on a cold night. I believe I enjoyed last year's a bit more though.

Spices are muted but present- allspice combined with an old clove studded orange.  T- More cinnamon in the taste which is a happy surprise. Some earthy bitterness on the corners of my tongue- the wintery hops are staying on the shelves of the root cellar I suppose.  M- Fairly easy drinking but overly light.  D- Simple but good.

S: Sweet and bready, with a huge amount of refreshing and slightly toasted malt scent.  T: The sweetness almost reminded me of the type you would get from fresh beets. Even though the sweet element was very present, there was a bit of breadiness and slipperiness that made this refreshing to the 10th power. This was like a mini-Doppelbock!  M: Sweet for sure, but not overbearingly so. The carbonation was perfect for the style, and drinking this one on the cold side (but only slighly so) definitely aided in giving this one a crispness (IMO of course).  D: I could honestly drink this all day long. Many have stated in forums that this brew was not what it used to be.... etc..etc...etc. That may be so, but I can't speak to that.

35,101,TheBrewo,3.68,"This brew pours a dark amber color, and puts up a one finger tan colored head. The head retains nicely, with mild lacing as it goes. The liquid is translucent, showing active carbonation and no sediment. The aroma is predominantly darker malts and wheat, dark candied fruits, a tinge of metal, and flashes of molasses. There is also spice, namely nutmeg and gingerbread. Faint hops flash at the very back of the nose. As we taste, there is a semi-malty start. It is quite heavy, and the combination from the grain bill gives us a little sourness. This quickly fades, and Christmas-like spices warm the middle. The end is partially sweet, from dark fruits and berries, and hops work their way in for a bitter balancing finale. The aftertaste breathes of grain, candy sweets, and distant citric hops. The body is full and the carbonation is medium. We sip with a bit of creaminess, but the bitter hop finish moves things along before there is time for coating or satiation. The mouth is wet, but left a touch dry after a little bit. The abv is on the lower cusp for the style, and the beer drinks with a satisfying ease.  Overall, what we enjoyed most about brew was the full look and blend of Christmas spice. The latter is apparent in both the aroma and the taste, giving us something that is seasonally appropriate and fitting for the weather. For the style it is arguably weak in the robustness category, but it certainly does not disappoint.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Taste is middle of the road wheat ale, medium-full malt, the yeast, the banana flavor fills up the body and the citrus gets the edges. Not much hop action, maybe a little coriander spice hidden in there.  Very drinkable because it is so mild. But that's the problem, it just doesn't stand out, even from other wheat ales.

Even if it's an ""ale"" why is it listed as a Bock? Fail.  Crystal clear dark brown. No head, no lacing.  Smells sweet. A hint of grapefruit juice? That's about it.  Nutty, sweet malts on the palate. Earthy, spicy hops balance out the malt. Quite bready. Has that typical Sam Adams metallic twang that I detect in the majority (yet not all) of SA beers.  Fairly thick mouth feel for what it is... which isn't much. Alcohol is very present, tastes ""hot"" especially for a 5% beer. Complete fail. Bock beers should not taste like this much alcohol.

There is quite a bit of sweetness here as well. Some cinnamon is present, but there isn't as much as there was in the nose. The finish is sweet and has a bit of hop presence.  M - It has a medium body and good crisp carbonation. There is also some bitterness. It has a bit of a creamy feel to it.  D - This has pretty good drinkability.

35,101,Bouleboubier,3.38,"Marketing this as a straight-up bock brew would have been more appropriate. Mentioning the additions to the recipe of cinnamon, ginger, and orange peel on the neck label set me up for quite a letdown. None of these flavors made much of an impression on the taste. To be true, through each sip, sensations of the cinnamon show up front while the ginger nips at the back, and the orange peel comes across as old and dried - preserved by chemical means. But they're all super weak in presence. Old Fezziwig, which boasts the very same seasonings, delivers in the way I hoped this would. Getting past my disappointment with the showing of the spice, what's right in front of you is a decent bock, if not rich or complex. Drinkable, yes.  I poured it into a pils glass (why? i can't recall). Finger-width head - diminished rapidly. A deep iced tea color and real clear. Aroma was nearly indiscernible - some faint fruity tones, which did show up in the taste as well. Spices? Nil. Last thing to add is a fairly clean feel, soft and smooth-ish beginning and slightly dry with a teeny-tiny warming rush in the finish. Comparable overall to a maltier, Mexican-made Vienna lager.

Not too much aroma a faint amount of cinnamon and gingerbread maybe, malty this is pretty subtle.  The taste is the same as the nose pretty faint cinnamon and ginger bread with a malty sweetness. There is a little bit of a a dryness that finishes pretty nicely.  The flavors are faint but I like it. I don't know if I'm being biased but this is a nice drinkable winter lager.

35,101,woodychandler,4.43,"I was out to Subs & Six Packs on Columbia Avenue on Tuesday and saw this available as a single bottle and decided to give it another whirl. Today is 16 Dec 2015, the boss is LT Dan, my partner is a redhead and my name is Woody. This is a true account of the events that follow. Only the names have been changed to protect the less-guilty. And now, for the facts. Just the facts.  From the bottle: ""German brewers may have been onto something centuries ago when they created rich bock beers for the winter. Our brew is a dark wheat bock subtly spiced with fresh ground cinnamon, ginger, & orange peel for a deep smooth flavor that's perfect on a cold winter's night. Cheers! [undersigned] Jim Koch""  The Pop! of the cap is never as satisfying as the Crack! of a CAN, but I am making do as best as I CAN't with these CANfounded bottles. An aggro pour to vent my frustration released two fingers of foamy, tawny head with decent retention. Color was a beautiful Copper-Brown (SRM = > 17, < 22) with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled of cinnamon and orange peel and I was put in mind of a Wassail Bowl. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium. The taste was spicy, but it lacked Ooomph. Yes, I got the cinnamon and ginger, but they seemed somehow muted, like I was not getting the full effect. Finish was dry, thanks to the spices, but I just wasn't feelin' it. A GLBC Christmas Ale would do the trick! Clearly, I liked this a LOT more on draft.  My original, on-tap/draft review dtd 24 Dec 2010 follows:  I had some on-tap last night, which I thoroughly enjoyed, BTW, and my usually non-drinking fellow USN-retiree buddy offhandedly mentioned that he scored some at a local PX for his son and he is actually having some and really enjoying it. TheCANQuest (TM), like heaven, will have to wait while I indulge in some bottles.  I should remember that ""Bock"" is a style of lager, but when the label(s) scream(s) ""Lager"", I default to the Greg Koch ""fizzy yellow sissy beer"" expectation, sometimes to be pleasantly surprised, as in this case. I got a finger of deep-tan head with good retention off of my pour. Color was a deep-copper with NE-quality clarity. I have seen pennies that were less copper-colored than this beer. I was reminded (again) of the beauteous Linda Lou, a striking redhead whose hair was not only this color, but hers was also as coarse as wire. Sigh. She left me while I was on a seven-month deployment to marry somebody other than me. My beer may taste faintly of salty tears. Boo hoo. Nose smelled of ginger (OK, now a reference might be getting old), cinnamon and nutmeg. I was reminded of baking cookies with my maternal grandmother as a kid. The other kids used to make fun of me for my culinary endeavors until they tried what I had made. I still like to cook, just not for by myself. If only I had Linda Lou for whom to make meals ... Mouthfeel was big, thick, creamy. You should really brace yourself for this one. The spices were simply alive on the tongue, each getting a turn on the ol' palate. It was like eating one of those cookies. The finish left me in a melancholy, nostalgic mood but that is not necessarily a bad thing. Good news, also, for my followers - it CAN be purchased outside of the Winter Sampler, unlike Old Fezziwg.

There's a malty aroma with a hint of cinnamon, but it's far from overwhelming or offensive.  This beer has an excellent mouthfeel that is creamy, yet not too thick, heavy or bubbly. The spice in the flavor is so subtle that I wouldn't have been able to place it without reading it on the label (cinnamon, orange zest, ginger).  The smooth, malty flavor is very pleasant and leaves very little aftertaste, making this beer very drinkable.

S - Spicy, cinnamon as soon as I opened the bottle, but it disappeared rather quickly and what remained was some sweet, caramelly, bready malts with some graininess here and there.  T - Less spice in the taste than what was in the smell. Dominated by the big, sweet, caramelly malts. Sweetness becomes a bit cloying towards the end.  M - Medium body, a tad high on the carbonation. Mostly clean on the finish but does leave some residual sweetness across the palate.  D - Pleasantly surprised, as I really wasn't expecting much going in. Nice character overall, but it gets a little too sweet for me by the end.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,BeerBuckeye,3.55,"A - Pours a deep amber, good head on it.  S - Sweet and malty. Some nice spice notes in there, orange for the sweetness, ginger for more of the crispness.  T - Pretty flavorful actually. Good amount of spice in there, some cinnamon, finishes with a decent amount of hops as well. Even a little fruity.  M - Coats the mouth a little. Crisp, but with a good amount of carbonation. Aftertaste is just a little bitter.  D - It actually feels a little heavy, easy to drink though.  Overall - Winter Lager, IMO is the best of the pure Sam Seasonals (i.e. Noble Pils, Summer Ale, Octoberfest, and this). I always find myself drinking some during the winter, even with the plethora of other great winter and Christmas beers out there. This beer isn't remarkable, but it's solid.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Jadjunk,3.73,"#8. This is my second Sam Adams, a winter seasonal. Neck reads: ""Samuel Adams Winter Lager is a classic holiday tradition. Subtly spiced with a blend of freshly ground cinnamon, orange zest and ginger for a rich, satisfying brew that will make winter seem a little warmer."" Let's see how it adds up.  (Appearance) Beer pours one-two finger depth off-white carbonated head that dies away quickly but leaves the surface covered with a thin film. Beer appears a dark copper or bronze with tones of red light. It is a dark beer, but bright enough to see through and is very clear. There is a good deal of thin sticky lacing streaking the sides of the glass that loses its momentum and becomes thinner as the beer warms. Carbonation seems very low, and clustered bubbles are very thin. It could carry a much more impressive appearance, but what's here doesn't look half-bad. 3.5  (Smell) Pretty good balance of sweet caramel malts and some earthy or toasty nuts amongst lighter piney hops. Beyond a faint citrusy odor, some ginger and some wheat scents, there is not much else that I can detect at this point. Beer does not smell as complex nor as pungent as I had hoped. 3  (Taste) Better. I can taste an appropriate amount of toasty grains complemented with spices here, of which I know one is cinnamon, and possibly some nutmeg or allspice. Nothing is overbearing. The orange flavors are more subtle here too, but pair well with the spices. Sweet malts and a touch of slight bitterness from some hops on the finish round out the taste, but the malts are far more dominating here. The beer is largely on the sweet side, but is impressively flavorful. 4  (Mouthfeel) A very medium body. The beer is carbonated, yet smooth and crisp at times. There is little aftertaste, just the same distinctive malty wheat and caramel with a complementing spice or two. The beer is slightly thin; it could be thicker-bodied. The alcohol is not as well hidden as in other drinks. There is a faint roasted note that remains the large part of the drink. Mouthfeel is pretty decent. 4  (Drinkability) Very drinkable, very nice flavor and a pretty good mouthfeel. I could have several of these in a row should I be craving something malt and spice heavy. I found it very easy to drink and largely enjoyable for a holiday brew. Perhaps not my ideal choice for a Sam Adams winter seasonal, but a fine one nonetheless. 4  Verdict: Not disappointing for a winter brew. It has enough complex flavors for me and most everybody without being a hard drinker. At some times thin and not very intense with flavor, it still remains a fairly impressive Sam Adams beer and I wouldn't mind making it a winter season regular.

35,101,tapman,3.23,"Colors of red, brown, and dark amber make up the body and a small head emerged after a careful pour which subsided very quickly to make a thin lacing. Carbonation appears minimal, a big difference between this one and the 'boston lager'.  Sweet malt aroma with some bready, tart hops and hints of spices supporting the sweetness. Too sweet for my nose. Nose is somewhat delicate nose, much less harsh than the regular 'boston lager'.  Tastes like a Sam Adams Boston Lager light, which is weird since it is darker than the SABL. Decent balance between hops, malt and spice, it is hard to pick any of them out. I can taste a little alcohol, though it is neither warm nor astringent. Good bitterness in the finish, I don't really get too much of the spices.  A fine mouthfeel, a little thin for a holiday bock if you ask me. Maybe a holiday helles, but then the color is off. meh.

S: Whoa, where are the spices this year? There's maybe just a hint of ginger on the front end of the aroma, but this smells much more like a straightforward bock (plenty of German hops, some caramel malt) than the sumptuously spiced winter warmer that this beer was last year. It's a decent enough smelling bock, but I miss my cinnamon and toffee.  T: Thin and sharp, with ginger and earthy hops dominating the front and back ends, respectively, followed by a little bit of bitter citrus on the aftertaste (orange peel, I presume?). Some bready malt shows up as it warms, but this doesn't have any of the candied fruit and spice complexity that I loved about last year's version. Disappointing.  M: Light and prickly. Not enjoyable.  D: While I'm upset by its thinness in terms of flavor, the hops do give it a nice crisp finish that avoids all potential pitfalls of being cloying or over spiced. Pretty easy to drink.  Notes: Perhaps I just got used to drinking last year's Winter Lager after a few months had mellowed it and sweetened it considerably, but there's just no way this can be compared to the 09 I drank just a couple weeks ago.

A - Dark bronze with burnt orange highlights, pouring a nice two finger head that settles into a finger and a half of fluff. Leaves light lacing down the glass that dissipates into spots and then nothing fairly quickly.  S - Caramel malt upfront quickly moves into ginger backed by orange peel and a bit of cinnamon (interestingly, there's a light sour cherry to it as well). I get just a little earthy and herbal hops on the back.  T - Caramel and a little toffee, with the ginger and a touch of orange coming in nicely (not as strong as in the aroma, which is nice). Like the ginger, the hops aren't as present as in the smell (and they weren't very present in the smell to begin with). I could use a touch more earthy hops.  M - Just the right amount of carbonation for this kind of brew, but I feel like it ends a bit cloying. It sort of dampens the whole experience at the end.

35,101,Brenden,3.6,"I had this on tap last night and it was one of those odd things in which the head is weak and all of the flavors don't come out for some reason. This has happened before with Noble pils, and it's been several locations.  This beer is deep copper, almost burnished bronze in color. A thick off-white head sits on top, about two finger high. It stays around for a while and leaves some sticky remembrance of itself on the glass. The aroma is backed by malts with plenty of spices but not overdone. There's also a firm wheat aroma and hints of fruits. There's a touch of something like white pepper that, in my opinion, makes the nose a touch dry and detracts from what little sweetness there is. It may be a lack of malt backing coming through that does this one in here. From the bottle it's full and flavorful. On tap, some of that's missing. I definitely lose a bit in the mouthfeel here. The body is medium but feels a touch fuller to me, and carbonation is adequate to add to the smooth feel but not too much to go beyond that.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

S: Malts foremost, with some hints of spice and alcohol.  T: Malts are noticeably present and it's a very crisp taste, but it's also rather bland. I'm not detecting what I had expected. There is something a little metallic to it when first poured, but that disappears as the beer warms, bringing out more of the hops and definitely the spices. I may have to let this one sit a few minutes next time.  M: Pretty crisp and light as one might expect from a lager. A little heavier than most lagers, but still goes down clean. Dry finish.

It had a nice reddish-brown colour. It's quite bright and clear, and has next to no head.  The smell has a bit of roasted toffee in it... I think there's a bit of warmed-up apple in there, too.  The taste? It's a bit different than I thought it would be after the smell and look. It's quite a bright flavour... at first, it's this hit of tangy, fruity hops, with some spice. It's like a bit of cinnamon in the background (maybe even some clove or other spices), with some apple... almost like chilled apple cider in some ways. Then, after you swallow, these sweet malt characteristics some out, like a bit of roasted toffee... it's more sweet than bitter, and more malt than hops. The spice and sweetness come out in the aftertaste, almost like you ate a bit of apple crisp a while earlier.  The feel is great. It's bright and fizzy in the mouth, smooth, slick, and not watery. Very refreshing.  Overall, quite a nice little lager. I enjoy these winter and fall lagers so much more (on the whole) than run-of-the-mill lagers. There's so much more flavour and depth to them, without them getting so complex that they overwhelm you. A great beer to just sit and drink on the holidays.

There are smells reminiscent of a bakery's cake department. Also some grassiness from the hops.  Taste features a delightful melody of winter spices. As the label mentions, cinnamon, orange zest and ginger are all present, but subtly in the background. All on a rich malty backbone. Not overly sweet as there is a nice balance to the beer. Perhaps some hints of caramel in there too.  Mouthfeel is very satisfying as the richness of the beer imparts a satisfying warming quality as I drink. Drinkability is excellent.

There's also a hard-to-define and rather perplexing barnyard funk quality (though not like a saison)...it's not really a good thing, but it's very mild. Could just be me.  T: Full bright-lagery maltiness with a well-balanced spiciness. Definitely get the ginger and a bit of citrus from the orange zest. Not much cinnamon, though the quality is somewhat evident.

I don't drink lagers much, but this is definitely one of the better lagers I've had (along with the Boston Lager.)  M: Quite full and rich. Lively carbonation. Quite nice.  D: I'm definitely a biased ale man, so lagers aren't exactly my cup-o-tea (or ale, I guess ha.) So with that in mind, it's a little easier to understand my criticism with lager drinkability. It's certainly one of the best American lagers that I've had (along with Yeungling), and it has a nice, full flavor. However, its ultimate lack of real complexity coupled with my finding it a bit cloying keeps me from reaching for another.

It's got a nice spiciness along with a lightly sweet finish and a subtle tang that builds between sips.  The high, prickly carbonation is actually kind of painful on the tongue.

35,101,Satchboogie,2.78,"From notes reviewed on 12/3/10: 12oz bottled poured into a SA Perfect Pint glass best by: April '11  A: Pours a light mahogany color, clear, dark red-orange hues when held to light, 1.5 finger bubbly head that dissipated quickly. Leaves a little lacing.  S: Smells exactly like a Boston Lager but a little spicier and sweeter. Orange zest is noticeable in the background.  T: Lots of malt, not a whole lot of hop character, spices are there but don't contribute much besides the orange zest, which helps to balance out the heavy malt bill. Alcohol seems more noticeable than a Boston Lager. This is basically a spiced up Boston Lager, but it isn't anywhere near as good.  M: Medium to high carbonation, medium body, a little chewy and sticky. I like the mouth feel on this better than the standard Boston Lager.  D: Alcohol seems too noticeable and ""harsh"" when compared to the Boston Lager. Has the same unpleasant aftertaste of SA lagers. It doesn't make me want to take another sip.  Overall this is pretty much a last resort for places that don't carry craft beer. I'd take the standard Boston Lager over this every time.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Smell is of caramel and toasted malt some citrusy hops and a faint cinamin/herbaly spice note. Taste is mostly sweet bready malt with a hint of cinamin and spice with a tiny citrusy hoppy twang. This beer seems subdoed from years past. Mouthfeel is clean and light, very light bodied beer.

Aroma is of mild sweet caramel malts along with some grains. Nothing real flashy to report here.  Sipping reveals a bit of sweet biscuity malt along with some slight caramel. The finish is mild and decent feeling. Some slight cherry or other berry flavor comes through as well.  Sharp carbonation up front, as a typical lager, with a medium-body. A bit watery finish, but not bad. Decent overall.

With that said, it seems extremely similar to their Boston Lager and Boston Stock Ale...perhaps somewhere wedged between those 2 as its not quite as sweet as the Boston Lager and not quite as hop forward as the Stock Ale. The differences are very subtle. Good beer, but too easily interchangeable with the others I mentioned.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,msfoster77,3.7,I was dissapointed with this beer. It poured an amber color with a tan head that went away very quicly. At first taste I get the hops bitterness and then I taste the ginger. I think the bitterness also comes from the orange peel. I bought a six pack and I think that's all I really need of this beer.

Drinkability: at first I would say the drinkability was average, but as the beer warmed up a couple of degrees and carbonation went down, it became much more drinkable.

Mouthfeel - Medium mouthfeel. Smooth and mostly dry. Leaves some on the palate. I would prefer a bit more.  Drinkability - This beer is ok. I like the plain ol' Boston Lager better however.

It had a malty smell along with a faint holiday spiciness in the background.  The flavors had a good balance. The malt profile was good, not to sugary. For the most part it tasted like a regular Sam Adams Boston Lager with spices built on top. I couldn't taste any of the spices advertised on the commercials. The spice aspect was very subtle and not very distinctive - sort of generic tasting. It also had a sour hoppy taste that cropped up now and again.  Drinkability was decent.

35,101,KidsDoc,3.7,"12 oz bottle into Unibroue tulip  Great pouring brew. Amber with tan head that builds to 2 fingers then slowly dissipates. Leaves a top lacing throughout the tasting. Minimal to no lacing left on the glass.  Aroma is mostly sweet malt and roasted grain. This stays strong throughout, the sweetness builds as the beer warms a bit.  Taste is malt all the way. Only in the very first sip did I get any faint hint of citrus hops followed by malt, caramel, and some roasted nuttiness? The beer finishes with a cinnamon aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is surprising medium-full bodied for most of this beer. Thins some as it warms. Carbonation is light. There is a sticky aftertaste that forces the next sip.  D: an enjoyable winter bock. Not filling at all and truly leaves you wanting more - maybe that aftertaste is what does it. I would certainly have this as a sipping beer for an evening",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,bagpiper2005,4,"Pour: Deep, clear reddish-brown color with a thick 2-fingered off-white head that retains decently. Leaves nice lacing on the glass.  Smell: Sweetness radiating from the caramel malts. Some hints of syrup/molasses, some spice notes, and some floral and spicy hops. Maybe even a bit of cinnamon coming through?  Taste: The palate is greeted with a delicate malty sweetness, giving way to some caramel and toffee flavors. Faint cinnamon spice comes through as you move to the middle of the palate. It's somewhat yeasty/bready, and has some nutty tastes in there as well. The back in hop bitterness is mild to moderate, and has hints of floral/earthy and spicy bitterness, and even a hint of ginger. No strong aftertaste to speak of. A very small hint of alcohol warmth.  Mouthfeel: Light to medium, absolutely silky smooth, and a fair bit of carbonation without being excessive.  Drinkability: This beer is very easy drinking, and not overly filling. Gets top marks in this category.  Final Notes: Definitely on the somewhat lighter side when it comes to winter beers. A great session beer and one to pair with either a big Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner, drank after dinner as a dessert beer, or paired with either a caramel or chocolate dessert. The ABV is not overkill (5.8%) and the flavors are very good.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Spica66,3.75,"Poured into a tulip.  A: Dark brown/red color. Nice head formation, minimal retention. Good carbonation level.  S: Smells like a good brown ale more than a lager. Hints of the spices that were used are definitely present, but I can't make out one specific aroma- which is good. I hate you open a seasonal beer and it screams ""nutmeg!"" or ""cinnamon!"".  T: Good brown malt base with some spice and hops on the finish. Not great, but well balanced.  M: A little watery, good carbonation level.  D: Clean, balanced taste. Smooth, light mouthfeel.

S- The smell is slightly hoppy with a touch of fruityness mixed in. To top it off someone decided to pour in some American Macro Lager into my beer, or at least the smell of one.  T- The taste is malty, a bit of dried fruits a touch of caramel which is all thrown down the drain when the taste of American Macro Lager comes into the mix.  M- Feels like a typical American lager, not so much a Bock though. Most Bocks I've had are lower in carbonation.  D- Would be a good cross over beer for the die hard American Macro Lager types.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Cinnamon comes through nicely and has hints of citrus with a hop bitter ending  M- Fairly heavy with mild carbonation  D- I for some reason think this may be Sam Adams best beer.

It smells of light malt, slight wheat, and light spices. The taste is better. It's pretty sweet and a little dry. It has moderate maltiness and has a maple like sweetness. It drinks pretty light and crisp.

A little sweet but pretty good.  t - Tastes of hops, cinnamon, and bready malts. Hints of spices, but a bit of a drop off from the smell; not really getting the fruit in the taste.  m - Medium body and moderate carbonation. Pretty smooth and creamy body.  d - A decent bock that is widely available and easy to drink.

Taste is woody and bitter. earthy, spicy. green hop bitterness. not as fruity as aroma leads me to believe. chewing on spiced wood, without any of that pleasant resinous pine. Just a bit funky nutty and earthy bitterness. Liquid walnut skins. the spice bitters.  Mouth is superb and fits the style perfectly. creamy and full with some good carbonation to cut through the bitter earth and leave the brew quite palate pleasing.  This is an interesting one. The flavors are really not all that palate pleasing and I'm not crazy about it, but the mouthfeel is pretty solid and all in all, it's not a bad iteration of a winter lager.

Poured a very nice dark red/amber body with a very slight off white head that lingered for a minute or two before dissappearing, no lacing is present.  Smell - hints of cinnamon and malty sweetness.  Taste - taste follows the nose, sweet malts, some very subtle hints of cinnamon and spices, they dominate much more as the beer warms up.... the hops show up for the finish, not heavy, but just enough to make their presence known.  Mouthfeel - I want to say medium but on the light side. Carbonation is very crisp and dances on the tongue.  Drinkability - this one is very high on the drinkability scale.

S: You defiantly get the spices in the smell as advertised with also a malty smell.  T: Similar to the smell you get a taste of spices and malt. As the beer get warmer the spices come out more.  M: Not a lot of carbonation but it goes down smooth. Has a bit of a warming feel at the end.  D: Another great seasonal from Samuel Adams.

A fair level of carbonation.  Smell: A scent of ginger spice, orange peel, sweet malt, and a tad bit of cinnamon, as well as herbal hops which lingers in the nose.  Taste: Starts off with citrus and hops, and a carbonation tingle, followed by a Creamy and sweet malt taste, slightly roasty which turns into somewhat of an earthy flavor. Ginger-spice and maybe a hint of cinnamon. Has a dry finish with a bitter bite at the end. A bit light, but no doubt tasty.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied. A Slick, crisp, and chewy mouthfeel.

35,101,Khazadum,3.75,"The first of the Samuel Adam's winter pack! Hopefully I'll barrel through these like I originally planned in a week. Poured this into my Hopleaf pint glass for instant consumption.  A- Creamy finger's worth of head generated on a traditional pour. Great retention. We are talking minutes of hangtime on this one. Some fine lacing depicts the larger than average bubble size, although this doesn't seem to hamper the headtime nor ability to stick. Ruby body with golden hues allows light to penetrate and display the many columns of carbonation.  S- The nose is a bit of a battle. It opens sharp with hints of cinnamon and other astringent spices ( nutmeg? ). A quick explosion of malt fizzles too fast for any real understanding. Following that, there is definitely the earthy hints of ginger balanced by a bitter orange, perhaps the peel is thrown in... upon reading the bottle I see that indeed orange zest is used in the brewing. Fantastic job getting all of these to come across. The malt fades away as time goes on leaving the spices and citrus to dominate.  T- The orange peel and hops are the opening notes. We have the balance of fruit bitters and floral bitters all at once. The citrus gives it a glowing edge that I definitely am a fan of. Towards the middle the cinnamon perks up unusually allowing a gentle transition towards a back end of sweetness. The finish is moderately clean. The remaining flavors are mild and border on the grassy and tea-like qualities of beverages, perhaps this is the ginger's role.  M- Decent body, full, smooth, and clean. The carbonation is where it should be. Alcohol doesn't detract and has only been detected on a few sips.  D- This is damn good. I'm shocked, but I shouldn't be. Definitely a suggestion to craft enthusiasts and novices alike. Samuel Adams has always been a solid beer up until now, why wouldn't I enjoy their winter offering?",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

The aroma seemed to have a good spice kick like cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, and brown sugar. It also had a good fruity malty aroma with slight hop character. The taste was pretty similar with fruity malts cinnamon brown sugar accents but it did have a little hop flavor on the backend. The brew was medium in body with a fair amount of carbonation which had a sweet, spice, and slight creamy finish.

S: A bit of caramel sweetness gives way to earthy hops. Nice.  T: A bit of sweetness quickly gives way to the earthiness which lingers, yet the beer finishes crisply and cleanly for a beer of this depth.

Pours light, clear chestnut with a fizzy slightly off-white, one-finger head which disappears quickly. No lacing at all. Smells strongly of malted barley, with a hint of spices and hops further back. The body is substantial, though a little weak around the edges, and tastes much like it smells: predominately toasted malts, with a bit of browned sugar, nutmeg, and cinnamon. A little on the sweet side and lacking in hops, but the malt doesn't overwhelm the palate and it still finishes pretty clean. A lower-than-normal carbonation helps bring the flavors out.  A pretty decent beer. Nothing special, but I wasn't disappointed and it went pretty well with the meal. I would have liked something a bit richer, but for a lager I really can't complain.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Nondescript maltiness up front that quite bland and flavorless but not super sweet. In the middle the carbonation becomes more prevalent and there is a lifeless ripe fruit flavor with a banana edge and faint spices. Finish is short, semisweet, and spicy.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,weizenbob,3.61,"12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass. The label changed this year to a strange blue, red and green design. I prefer the old blue and white label but that's neither here nor there; you can't taste a label. A frothy two finger tan head tops this dark caramel-hued beauty. Lots of carbonated bubbles meander to the top. The head eventually settles leaving thick lacing down the sides of the glass. Sam Adams sure knows how to make good looking beer.  The smell is lagery with the scent of sweet potato emerging with a good amount of clove. Ever so slight caramelized malt scents drift through the nose as well as some faint chocolate notes.  The taste is full and thick and delicious. Not surprisingly there is a heavy malt presence. Tastes of clove and cinnamon cut through the mix. It's a little bit woody in the middle. The alcohol is noticeable toward the end of the flavor profile and sticks to the back of the mouth, mildly resembling whiskey. One could hope for a bit more sweetness to compliment the malt, but as is, this isn't bad.  This is pretty pleasant in the mouth as well. Winter warmers should be pretty malty and although this isn't as thick as it could be, it's still a substantial beer. Mild carbonation is perfectly balanced with the malt profile, adding a small bit of effervescence that tickles the flavors on your tongue in just the right way. It's not too heavy. Some might even call it tame.  I guess drinkability would depend on your tolerance for alcohol. At 5.6% ABV Sam Adams Winter Lager is a bit mellow for a winter warmer but it is pretty easy drinking, which is saying something given the amount of flavor they've packed into this brew. Still, 5.6% is far from sessionable. If you don't mind getting a little flush in the face and putting on a solid buzz, you could put a few of these away with relative ease and enjoyment.  As a side note, I hate to be one of those guys who complain that this year's seasonal isn't as good as last year's seasonal, but it should be noted that the formulation of the Winter Lager has changed in recent years. At one time this was a super malty 6.9% ABV warmer. I hadn't had this in a few years, and I remembered it being very malty and sweet and perhaps a bit more subtle with the spices. That's not to say that it used to be better, because this is very good on its own terms. It's just different than you may remember if you haven't tried this in a while. I still recommend it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

M: Medium bodied, medium to high carbonation. Lighter than i thought it would be though.  D: Very easy to drink many of these, though that may not be all that positive. I was expecting a little more bite to this one, but didn't get it.

The biggest complain with sam adam's beers for me is their nose. They simply don't have enough aroma. The spices are there but I can't pull them apart. There's some malt but I can't get much from it.  Ginger, and other spices. The bottle tells me orange zest and cinnamon and I can see the cinnamon and a touch of orange but without being told I'd be a bit confused about it. There isn't much to say here. It seems a touch wheat based though I'm not sure if that's the spices. Think lighter body and fairly simple. Nothing about this beer is bad but nothing is good.  Without the spices this might be a great summer beer. With them it's just odd and not good for a hot day or a cold one.

Light, grassy hops dance around the palate before some sticky spice dashes through. Cinnamon and orange zest combine for an interesting flavor.

35,101,dcook11,3.5,"I like to let this beer warm up a long time, so I left it out of the fridge for about forty minutes. This beer is reviewed out of a pint glass and as part of the winter seasonal pack. I must say that many of the Sam Adams beers in the seasonal have a very similar quality to them. Pleasant to drink, but very safe.  A- Pours a cranberry red with a one finger white head. The beer is highly carbonated and small bubbles rise to the top of the glass in fine streams. Some lacing is apparent but quickly fades as the beer warms (although I did take the beer out for a good forty minutes before drinking). Like many other Sam Adams beer in the six packs, this brew could have benefited from more lacing and a more persistent head.  S- Like all of the beers in the seasonal, the first impressions are of a slight caramel sweetness from the malt. This is backed up by a touch of cinnamon that blends well with the sweet malt. I also detect a faint butter scotch. A slight hop presence is noticeable, but very subtle...almost non-existent. The final scent is that of ginger, which levels out some of the sweetness. The smell is very balanced and you have to really struggle to get these scents.  T- An initial bite from the ginger. Ginger is much more assertive in the taste then the smell and one of the first things I notice. I malt sweetness and a touch of cinnamon follows the ginger...and finally a mild hop presence. The taste is much more malt than hop dominant, but the balance is still well established.  M- The mouth feel is light bodied with a slight bite from the high carbonation.  D- Drink ability is relatively high as this is a very safe beer. It's well balanced and delicious, but quite neutral. I could drink more than a few of these back to back, but after a while the ginger may begin to pose a problem.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,MrSkyGuy,3.67,"You know, I have to admit outright that this isn't my favorite SA, but that may very well be due to the fact that I don't prefer seasonal winter brews by taste.  I drank this in a clear freezer-frosted pint, and again in a room temperature pint. When I don't detect a difference between the two, it usually raises an eyebrow. SA's Winter Lager pours average with a relatively weak head that flattens quickly, but it does make up for this somewhat with a smooth hoppy aroma. I detect the light holiday'ish spicing, and I don't like it. Perhaps the dark caramel color is messing with what my taste buds are telling me, but I left this lager feeling a little underwhelmed.  No hard feelings to Sam Adams--they produce a solid line, but this one is lower on my list than the rest.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,crossovert,3.36,"12 oz bottle.  It pours a deep copper red with a foamy white head. It doesn't look much like a bock, but it does look very nice.  The smell is malty with a hint of caramel and alcohol. The hops come through a little bit and there is a hint of orange, but the spices don't really come through. It isn't super fragrant.  The spices and whatnot come through in the flavor. This one has a diacetyl problem like I have tasted in several recent SA beers. The cinnamon and ginger are pretty noticeable, along with the buttery bready malts. The 2 aforementioned spices have a little bit of spicy bite in the finish. The orange comes through with a bit of tanginess.  It is an interesting brew, not really a bock, but what else woudl you call it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Light aroma of malt and a hint of spices. A little note of yeast.  Decent taste of malt, yeast and some light spices. Reminds me of some of the belgian spices on first taste.  Fairly heavy carbonation. Easy drinking brew.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

35,101,StoutHunter,3.55,"This brew came in the Samuel Adams winter 12 pack, lets see how it goes. Poured from a 12oz brown bottle into an imperial pint glass.  A- This beer pours a dark copper color with 2 fingers of white head that died down to a small thin ring that stayed till the end.  S- Not a lot going on in the aroma. There is some roasted caramel malts and a slight toffee smell. There's also a bit of grassy hops at the end.  T- The taste starts out with a lot of slightly roasted malts mixed in with a some various spices that I can't individually point out. There's also some orange peel thrown into the mix and just like the aroma there's a slight presence of hops at the end.  M- Medium bodied and medium carbonation.  D- This beer is fairly drinkable, I wouldn't drink a lot of these but a 2 or 3 would hit the spot. Alcohol is barely drinkable. Kind of reminds me more of Vienna style lager then a bock.  Overall this was a good beer, but nothing I would rave about though. The flavors are very balanced and unoffensive. I don't think i would by a six pack of this but I don't mind the 2 that they throw into their winter variety pack. This beer is better then the white ale that's for sure.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

S: Weak smell of spices on top of a typical lager smell. T: Spicy. Flavors change over the course of the drink. Starts with hints of cinnamon which give way to ginger and malty taste. Very tasty. D: This is a very drinkable beer. Definitely sessionable.  This beer overtook Boston Lager as my favorite Sam Adams brew. Delicious. Add this to the reasons why I love winter. 12/14/12: The 2012 version of this beer is not nearly as good as the '10 or even the '11 and I feel the difference is significant enough to warrant a note on this review. The delicious spicy finish is MIA in this version, much more subtle. Hops are more prevalent as well.

35,101,cheesepuffs,3.56,"This was my first bock, and I guess I just don't like the style in general after reading more about them, but this seems like it fit the style well. It's not my kind of beer but it's not bad by any stretch of the imagination. Much hoppier than I expected.  The main thing that stuck out for me was that the head and lacing were phenomenal. I poured the perfect pint into a Sam Adams glass myself and the head stayed for minutes and the lacing was impressive. It did everything it was supposed to pretty well, but unfortunately, personally I'm just not into the taste. Seemed almost skunky to me so maybe mine was just old but it didn't go down easy for me.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,sommersb,3.29,"12 oz. bottle with a best before date of March 2011. Served in a Sam Adams perfect pint. Came in the SA winter pack.  Very attractive, clear copper beer with a good amount of bubbles from carbonation streaming from the bottom. Nice amounts of lacing and a hearty 3 finger head of creamy off-white.  Smell was very crisp, but seemed weak to me. I got a little malt aroma and some hop aroma, but not the spices that the label listed. The taste also disappointed me. I got some malts but as in the smell, they seemed weak for the style. Still not much on the spice front. No real malt sweetness in the taste - it seemed like it had a burnt character instead and a bitterness I didn't expect for a bock.  Mouthfeel seemed a little heavy on the carbonation, but the aftertaste was clean and malt forward. This is an OK beer, but overall nothing special.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,ixodus,3,A: Poured into a Guinness Pint Glass. Dark brown/red with a finger sized white head that bubbles down slowly to a white foam covering the top.  S: Not smelling to much here. Some roasted malts and a light hop smell with some spices I can't put my finger on.  T: A nice malty taste with some spices in there still can't pick them out.. maybe cinnamon? Also a slight orange peel taste at the end. Much better then the White Ale.  M: Rich and smooth with nice carbonation.  D. I can see me drinking a few of these. Not the best beer I've had but if I was in a restaurant with a limited selection I wouldn't mind getting a tallboy of this.

35,101,ccbrewer138,4,"Usually stay away from commercial lagers, even if coming from a craft brewery, but Sam Adams typically has some exceptional versions of all styles of lagers and ales also.  A-deep amber in color, with a huge, fluffy, off white head that very slowly disappears. Nice lacing on an imperial pint glass, the closest thing that I had to a Sam Adams glass. Good head retention, also brilliant in color and clarity.  S-picking up mostly toasty malt and spices, little hop aroma, not a very strong smelling beer. Good job with the spice blend though, very balanced and nothing sticks out as overpowering.  T-with little description on the bottle, it is hard to pinpoint what style this would be. Tastes like some wheat might be used, also Munich or Vienna. Very smooth lager character which blends well with the spice blend. Again, nothing about the spice is overpowering, hard to pinpoint whether you are tasting hops, spices, or both. Strange thing is, it's refreshing, yet warming.  M-medium carbonation, and medium body, fine by my book.  D-for a winter beer, very drinkable.

The taste starts a little sweet, then you're hit with a nice cinnamon and ginger spiciness. Lightly hopped so it finishes a little awkward. I also pick up a little orange peel/zest in the finish.  Light and drinkable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,epicness,3.88,"A - Dark amber, almost brown color. Off-White creamy head that dissipates rather quickly leaving watery lacing on the glass.  S - A faint sweet caramel malt with a little bit of cinnamon. Not much of a true scent really present with this one.  T - Caramel and spicy up front which gives way to a dominate earthy hop taste. There's also cinnamon and ginger present towards the finish of the beer, but the true finish has a citrus flavor which becomes more noticeable as the beer begins to warm up.  M - Light to medium bodied with slight carbonation.  D - Pretty drinkable beer with only a 5.6% ABV. Although it does have a nice flavor, and the ABV isn't high. Due to the complexity of the flavor, I couldn't see myself drinking more than 2-3 of these in a sitting before I became sick of it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,NODAK,3.85,"Nose has some sweet malt present, with a hint of wheat and spiciness showing.  Taste is comprised of sweetness upfront with hints of orange and caramel apparent, along with a hint of spiciness that I think comes from the cinnamon. A small bitterness is on the backend, with some wheat lingering afterwards that make it clear that this is a wheat lager.  It isn't as forward on the flavors as I recalled.

Dark, transparent reddish brown color with little visible carbonation. On the nose, it's mostly bready malt with a hint of spices. In the mouth, it's malty, bready, with hints of diacetyl and peppery spice; I'm not really getting the ""nutmeg"" flavor, but it's not bad... slight citrusy hops balance. Mouth is crisp and clean and slightly dry. Drinkability is good: It's unassuming and flavorful, yet not terribly complex.  Overall: A decent brew, not terribly complex or interesting.

35,101,DelMontiac,3.73,"Poured from a 12oz bottle dated best by April (2011, I assume) into a pint glass.  A: Great dark amber color with an off-white very short-lived weak half inch head.  S: Not particularly exiting in this category. Weakly sweet and malty is about all I can say.  T: This is why I look forward to SAWL each year. While not abound with some complex assortment of distinguishable flavors, SAWL fits the BA definition of a bock to a T - plenty of caramel malt sweetness and lightly hopped. I can't deny a nutmeg presence and at times I think I detect cinnamon or maybe ginger or both.  M: Great drinkability. No problem with SAWL being the only brew at a football watch party.  Overall: I never miss SAWL when it hits the shelves - a great goto winter brew. It's always a hit with BCMers when I take some to a MMA/football watch party. Two bummers though - SA, why did you change the label guys? The new label looks like spring! The old label, while a bit boring, represented the cold snowy blustery nights of winter with it's color alone. The other bummer is that one pump and done head.

Mahogany/burnt orange body, brilliantly clear with a faint glimmer of lighter orange highlights. A small thin beige cap of dense cream rests atop the glass. Decent retention.  Aroma is rather lackluster, with not hint of melanoidins or other deep malty notes. There is a low roasted wheat element which forms a backdrop to the spices and citrus, but everything remains rather vaguely presented.  Low caramel notes and a moderate bitterness on the palate, but no toasted malt notes are present. The cinnamon adds some complexity and the ginger lends liveliness and warmth to the palate. The orange peel comes through in the finish along with a dry crackery note. No diacetyl.  Medium-light bodied, moderate carbonation, slightly warming but more from spice than alcohol.

S - Sweet caramel malt, muted earthy hops, cinnamon and nutmeg. T - More caramel malt and spicy, earthy hops dominate with some toasted nuts and crackers around the edges. Ginger and cinnamon are noticeable, but not a prevalent as the nose would suggest. Orange peel flavor gets strong as the beer warms up, providing a nice bittersweet balance. M - Medium-thin body with medium carbonation. Nice and smooth. D - Moderately drinkable, I could probably have two.

35,101,SovereignBCS,3.21,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  A - I absolutely LOVE the color of this beer. It looks like it ought to be drank under a hand-knit afghan while sitting by a crackling fire on Christmas eve. The appearance is rich amber, and it just looks warm and inviting.  S - Smell is good, but nothing exceptional. Warm cinnamon and orange peel, some other spice, maybe coriander?  T - Extremely malty, but a good flavor overall. The cinnamon and spices come through in the flavor, but the orange zest is conspicuously absent, even in the aftertaste. A great winter beer, wouldn't want this in the summer months.

Taste: lightly nutty malt with just a hint of fruity yeast character and a solid balancing bitterness. Slight caramel around the edges as well. I quite like it.

As always a nice inch of foam from these beers.  S - Well it has some spice but really dominated by a dry grain.  T - Yep the grain is pretty harsh. Almost makes me wonder why it is considered a bock with ""lager"" in the title, but it just tastes like a spiced lager which the spice is having a hard time covering up the lager funk.  M - Light to medium, it drank rather well.  D - Well thankfully I only have one more since I only sprung for the half case but it really hasn't improved much from last year.

The nose comprises caramel, light roasted malts, light milk chocolate, rye bread, and orange zest. The taste is very similar, but a bit spicier: Newcomers nutmeg, cinnamon, coriander, and cola add some complexity to the flavor, but seem to somewhat overshadow the other parts. Or, rather, it comes in phases. However you prefer to hear it, everything doesn't mesh perfectly. Yeah. The body is a nice medium, with a moderate carbonation and a semi-grainy feel.

Head dies down to something thicker than a thin film. Thin strands of lacing here and there.  Smell: With a good swirl I can smell caramel malts and ginger. Without the swirl - smells are muted.  Taste: Mild caramel malts up front that run into a spicy finish. The spices really run together, cinnamon first then merging into ginger with a spicy heat on the tongue. If there is orange peel in there, I can't find it. It's okay.  Mouthfeel: Mild carbonation - I think the spiciness on the tongue is more from the ginger. A little watery otherwise.  Drinkability: Okay - I think this really isn't a bock but is instead more like an attempt at a watered down winter warmer. The spices become more of a bitter finish as the beer warms up - I dunno...maybe it a bock lager after all but the spices take away from it.

A wet sweet blanket of malt with biscuit tones backed up by moderate bitterness and those additions of clove, ginger, and orange. The malt is musty and whole wheat. Fortunately not horribly sweet, but it can't seem to figure out what it wants to be; sweet or bitter, spicy or hoppy.  Fizzy with a moderate body.

There is a slight off-white creamy head that dissipates after a few minutes. There isn't as much lacing as I origionally expected, but a little bit, and there's a ring of foam around the top of the liquid.  The smell is good, dominated by malts in a big way. In addition to it there is some holiday spiciness involved. Hints of cinnamon, nutmeg and some slight orange zest.  The taste is much like the smell. A big malty start. After the malts hit your tongue you get the tastes of cinnamon and nutmeg. No hops really present in the flavor but it has a slight earthy bitterness at the end.  The mouthfeel is good, certainly full bodied. Rich, well balanced and full of flavor. A perfect winter beer, especially if you're not particularly in the mood for a stout or porter.

About average in general, but below average for a Sam Adams.  Smell: The spices take center stage on the nose. I can catch some roasted malts in there too. Smells good, but it's something I've smelled before for sure.  Taste: Lighter than expected off the nose. Orange peel and malts come in right away, followed by a bouquet of spices. Just a hint of hops come in towards the middle-end. Not much of an aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Decently high carbonation, it goes down really smooth. Great mouthfeel.  Drinkability: Extremely drinkable, there's nothing offending in the start or the back that'd make you not want to drink more.  Why is this a winter seasonal?

35,101,Groomsy,3.69,"Review taken from notes, consumed on Nov. 3, 2010.  12 oz. bottle marked with freshness date of March 2011; poured into a mug.  Appearance: Absolutely beautiful in my eyes - pours a very sexy red/ruby color with a very solid 1-finger beige/tan head, although I could have maybe poured this a little harder. It leaves some very good lacing at first down the glass, but the head dissipates to a few millimeters (though it sticks around) and leaves only some minimal spots down the mug. Looks like a beer from a dream.  Aroma: I actually find the aroma a little hard to discern, it took some concentration. But when I was able to narrow it down, the malts were the first thing that blasted my nose, especially caramel/toffee; this beer is loaded with them. I also detected some spices like cinnamon and even a little bit of orange in there as well. Hop aroma is there, very earthy, but not nearly as prevalent as it could be. Weak, but promising for what it is.  Taste: The taste starts off with a strange but inviting mixture of tangy orange peel and roasted malts, with flavors of caramel being the most evident. The malts really dominate in the beginning here. There's just a bit of earthy hop bitterness in the middle as well, followed by some cinnamon and almost a sugary dough type of taste in the finish, which is dry and crisp. The alcohol in this brew almost overwhelms the taste, but not quite. Very warming and hearty with some spices going down. Wonderful taste here.  Mouthfeel: There's a ton of carbonation in this beer which brings out the various flavors, and going down, the beer isn't overwhelming, but it's pretty thick and creamy. I guess the word would be ""heavy""; this is a beer to handle gently. It finishes on a slightly bitter/alcoholic note.  Drinkability: Definitely a good beer with wonderful flavor, but I couldn't slam these down. This is a beer to enjoy on a slow night while having conversation with friends and is definitely a ""sipper"" type of brew. I couldn't imagine having more than 2 or 3 in one sitting, no matter how wonderful the flavor is.  A great seasonal from Sam Adams, and a solid way to dive into the Winter Variety pack. Enjoy this one and savor it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,geryeb624,4.08,"12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  A- Pours a nice dark amber with a little over a finger of creamy head. Looks very nice, decent retention as well.  S- Malty, a caramel Oktoberfest type way. Also some light spiciness in the background from the cinnamon and ginger, though by no means overwhelming.  T- Very nice bready, crackery maltiness with a little dark fruit and a little spice. Does well to not bash you over the head with the spice. Quite a hearty flavor, with some nice holiday notes.  M/D- Smooth & creamy mouthfeel, very drinkable and quite delicious.  A very nice winter seasonal that captures the season without killing you with gimmicks. Other than maybe Brooklyn BCS, my favorite beer of the season so far.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,WeezyBoPeep,4.01,"Poured from a bottle into a standard pint glass.  A: Clear, dark red and amber with a brownish hue. Light beige head with okay lacing, nice retention, wonderful clarity.  S: Spiced lager with a decent hop presence and a big blast of roasted malt. Brown sugar is detectable, along with some caramel and grains; mostly corn.  T: Surprisingly refreshing and forward for a lager, this beer is hoppy and malty at once with spices lingering in there. Middle is slightly bitter, but it doesn't carry over to the finish, which is sweet and buttery with that brown sugar hint really hitting home on the way down the throat.  D: Definitely drinkable. Possibly my favorite Samuel Adams beer so far. Excellent fall/winter beverage.  Value: For once,I don't mind spending 8 or 9 bucks on a sixer of Samuel Adams.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,speter,3.58,"A: Pours a deep copper color with a solid two-finger fluffy head that persists. Good lacing.  S: A blend of bock and a wit. There's a high level of malt, along with the wheat and spices.  T: Follows the nose closely as a blend of a bock and a wit, which works surprisingly well.  M: Medium body with brilliant carbonation. A touch of warmth.  D: A nice beer for a winter evening.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,GeeButtersnaps,2.83,"Appearance was very enticing, deep amber in color and very clear. Gave off a fairly faint aroma although I could smell the malt and what smelled like a hint of spice. Taste was pleasant but a little bland at first however I did not like the way it finishes. Hard to describe with my unrefined palate but it tasted a little harsh at the end, hardly inviting me to take another sip.  While this is the first Winter Lager I've ever tried I would have to say that to me this beer is a C possibly C+ at best, wouldn't recommend.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,phideltashaggy,3.51,"Poured from a bottle into Boston Lager perfect pint.  A-I think the appearance is my favorite part of this brew. It pours a beautiful rust/brown color with a straw-colored head with ok lacing.  S-Hops and darker malts dominate the nose. I sense a touch of spice and fruit, but both are faint.  T-Not as much spice as I was expecting, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The malts are very upfront with a slight dry hops finish.  MF-On the thinner side for a Sam Adams.  D-This is a decently drinkable beer, I could easily drink two or three, but not terribly quickly. Not a session brew for me, but a nice beer to sit down and enjoy over a conversation.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,mbrown26,3.96,"A pretty solid 4 out of 5 offering from Samuel Adams. Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  A: A nice amber hue and a dirty looking head that dissipated fairly quickly, but left a nice lace through the end of the beer.  S: Nothing to write home about for a seasonal bock beer. Smelled caramel, toffee and coffee notes.  T: A great tasting beer that had a nice balance between alcohol and flavor. Neither overpowered the other. Best characteristic of the beer was the taste.  M: Didn't make my cheeks pucker and got me to think about what flavors I was tasting. It drink like a beer should drink.  D: Easy to drink. Every sip made me look forward to the next.  Recommendable and will hopefully buy more.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Vixie,3.7,"Pours a nice red color with about a half inch of tan head.  Smell is malt, coffee, toffee. It almost reminds me of the smell of spiced cider.  Taste starts nice and sweet, a bit like apple, a bit like apricot. There is some spice there, can't quite put my finger on exactly what, does leave a bit of a peppery taste in the finish. I can detect just a hint of hops at the back end as well.  Not bad, a bit watery, but the carbonation and spices helped make it a bit more solid.  I found this one easy to drink and to like. Just a nice pleasant beer, nothing outstanding, but very much worth trying if you want a nice easy to drink beer. I'd happily have more of this.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,MirImage,3.95,"Appearance: Beer pours a dark reddish with a white head, okay lacing.  Smell: Smells a little biscuity with some nutmeg and orange peel notes.

Drinkability: Fairly easy to drink.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,puboflyons,4.07,"From the 22 fl. oz. bottle with a date of April clipped off the label. The pour is a nice looking amber-red with about a finger of cream colored sliky head. I like the label on this year's edition better than the snow white one from 2009. The aroma is well-spiced with nutmeg and malts. The taste also has an enjoyable nutmeg, toasted maltiness to it. A very likeable beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,wmtxbb,2.98,"Appearance: Copper amber, very clear. Head dissipates into nothingness. Not very impressive.  Smell: Almost non-existant, maybe a little malt smell... that is about it.  Taste: Amber malts with some spice. Sort of an interesting zing flavor from the yeast. Maybe a little ginger. I'm having trouble finding the ""cinnamon, orange zest and ginger for a rich, satisfying brew..."". I like the aftertaste, but this beer isn't a quality brew. There needs to be more of a malt presence.  Drinkability: Overall, this brew is drinkable, but not above average. I haven't been impressed by Sam Adams yet. They make better beer than some of the other big brewers, but most of their beers lack malt character and aroma. A sure sign they are cutting corners to make a subpar product for the masses.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,bohemiandonut,4.12,"All of these beers are pouring marvelously. Fluctuating inches of creamy head atop a darkly cherry body. The scent is everywhere, tart spicy drafts that just beckon a cool November breeze. Very tart. Amazing.  Taste almost supports the smell but not to the degree I'd hoped. Still, a good length away from Boston Lager and a much more drinkable affair in my book. If this veered away from the spicy sweetness it offers in the mouth toward the cherry vagueness of the smell I could see this being an absolutely impeccable ale. If Sam Adams ever does a Wild we are in for one helluva treat.  A nice dessert for Santa.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,JayS2629,3.2,"Poured from 12 oz bottle my buddy brought over.  A- Nice copper amber with a sudsy foam.  S- Either its weak or my sense of smell is. Slight orange peel. I smell the hopps a little bit.  T- This is supposed to be brewed with cinnamon, orange zest and ginger. I really don't taste any of those. Not complex. I sense hints of the orange zest and maybe a bit of ginger, but it isn't much different than the regular lager. They water down the taste. I sense no cinamon at all. It seems like I almost taste wheat?  M- this is ok. Its smooth. Watery.  D- Easy to drink, but nothing impressive. Watered down for the masses. I won't buy again, and I love Sam Adams. Its redeeming factor is that it has that signature Sam Adams taste, and thats a winner.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,thebrood1987,4.25,Smells like a really nice sweet malt with some cinnamon and some orange on the back. The taste is a very nice malty full bodied beer. Its like a wheat beer but with a bunch of rich malts thrown in to mix with the wheat. The malt tastes like a hint of chocolate with bready and toffee/carmael like malt. Like I said this blends very well with that cereal malt wheat taste that Samuel Adams uses in some of their beers. The cinnamon blends in so well as well. The hops are very mild but mix in with the orange corriander like finish. There is also some very slight ginger in there as well to mix in with the cinnamon and malts used which reminds you of Christmas in a way. I guess that's why they call it Winter Lager and now give it it's new more festive label. This is a very good beer and my favorite seasonal from Samuel Adams besides the Noble Pils.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

D - Definitely drinkable on a cold winter night, as I can attest to.  Overall, this is a decent dark wheat lager, but nothing overly special.

35,101,Andrew644,3.16,"Poured from a 12oz bottle.  A- Nice amber color but the head starts average and then disappears quickly  S- Nice malt smell but the spices overwhelm the hops.  T- The maltiness is perfect but having three spices in the beer really overpowers the hops, I get almost no hop flavor and the ginger overpowers not only the hops but also the other two spices.

D- The drinkability is average, it is a nice beer for the winter months.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,thebeerdoctor,4,"Poured from a 22 ounce bottle, this copper colored holiday annual has a subtler nose this year, with less emphasis on immediate aromatics, although there is plenty of malty depth. The palate has lost a bit of its chocolate profile, but there is a cherry note here. The Saigon cinnamon that once almost sent this lager into the land of wassail, has been properly applied again this year. Other so-called craft breweries could learn from this careful recipe. It is festively tasty and bright, and very well matched for the winter season. Being analytical towards this brew is all fine and dandy, but in the long run, it is probably best to just sit back and enjoy. Your beer taste buds are smarter than you think.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

The scent is very malt forward, a thick maple syrup type smell emanates from the brew. It's very smooth and mellow with a slight spiciness to it reminding me of the winter holidays.  The flavor profile is pretty impressive on this one, I get a honey wheat bread type flavor in the beginning fading into the sweeter maple and brown sugar body of the brew which is the bulk of it. The end finishes with a slightly nutty aftertaste, like candied walnuts in my mind.  The mouthfeel is great, full bodied malty and smooth as crystal clear water.

Notes of clove and some fruit also sneak in there. The flavor pulls all these aromas together, with the initial sweetness being cut by the bitter crisp hop finish at the end.

Mostly just the malts and so many spices going on my palate just wasn't able to distinguish many other than of course the cinnamon.  A little thicker/heavier of a beer.

Topped by about two fingers of cream colored head. Retention is so-so but eventually drops to a small cap. A few streams of bubbles rise in the glass. Minor lacing.  Aromas are faint and mostly nondescript. Malty and spicy, a good amount of cinnamon. Some hops in the background. Not too much going on.  Taste is pretty close to the nose. More flavors stick out. Malty sweetness with holiday spices. Cinnamon and some nutmeg stand out. Wheat bread. Slight hop bitterness on the finish.  Heavier side of medium bodied. Pretty smooth and creamy.

It pours a little browner than the Boston lager, with a white head. Smell is malt, with a hint of spice. Taste is the same, but I think it's still a bit weak for a winter ale.

Sweetness get a bit grainy as the brew warms.  T: Palate follows the nose, but is a tad more rounded out. Quite malt forward - toasty and caramel - with a sweetness that lingers.

The spices hang around the aftertaste for a bit.  M: Creamy, medium body with average carbonation. Finish is both malty sweet and drying from the spices. Just a touch warming.  D: Pretty nice.

Smells nice and malty, roasted caramal, toast.  Taste, like most of the BBC beers, is just solid. The great thing about drinking their beers is when you crack one open, it just nails the style on the head every time. Assertively malty but not overdone, pleasant toasty and caramel feel, just what you want after coming out of the cold.  Mouthfeel has a warming sensation to it, not too thin like most bock's fall victim to.  Overall, a great beer that most people can appreciate, especially in the cold midwest winters.

Taste is sweet malts, bread, orange, winter spice such as cinnamon. Reminds me a bit of the Octoberfest but better. Taste is a little funky at the end. Mouthfeel is a bit thin. Easy to drink but I'm not sure I'd want to session it.  Extra notes from 2010 batch:  Didn't like it as much this year, maybe due to different tastes this year or just a recipe change. Has kind of a artificial Hi-C fruit punch taste to it, mouthfeel is weak and prickly, seems unbalanced. Still, not a bad beer.

M - Kind of grainy, but overall pretty smooth. I think its just the right amount of carbonation with this brew.  D - Very easy to drink. Goes down smooth and leaves you wanting another sip pretty soon thereafter.  Poured into a regular pint glass. I had one of these cold, and one that was just cool.

Samuel Adams Winter Lager doesn't do such a bad job living up to my vision but its not a perfect fit either. It looks and smells good enough for most people I suppose. Tan head, lacing, blah blah.

I don't really pick up any hops or alcohol here so this one seems to be all about the winter spices and the rich caramel malts.  Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is a bit on the light bodied side with moderate to active carbonation that scrubs the tongue nicely. The finish is relatively short and mostly malt and wheat finishing up their work and moving on.  Drinkability: This is a pleasant enough beer to have with dinner or as something to drink while engaged in chatting with friends. It has an interesting mix of flavors but it not so complex as to demand your full attention. It would be interesting to have 3-4 of these of an evening to see if the flavors grow on one. While I won't go out of my way to have one of these again I also won't make any special effort to avoid it. This is a good workman-like beer and a good value for the money. One of the strengths of this beer is that the spices are subdued and enrich the flavor without taking it over.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,strictly4DK,3.82,"Sixer of 12 oz bottles bought from Montana West bottle shop. Poured into my Duck Rabbit pint glass.  A - Dark copper with ruby hues, translucent, pours a 1.5 finger fizzy off-white head. Recedes to a collar with no lacing.  S - Spices (cinnamon, ginger) are faint but definitely present. Sweet citrus from the orange peel compliments the winter spices and doughy malt backbone.  T - The same aspects from the nose are all present but the spices exude a greater influence while remaining balanced and complimented each other. Finishes with the traditional lager notes, slightly sulphuric and toasty. Solid backbone for the sweet spices upfront.  M - Slightly thin body which makes it very refreshing. Carbonation is slightly biting which I think fits well with the light spices. Toasty grains linger on the palate.  D - This is a tasty, refreshing lager that provides exactly what it advertises (cinnamon, ginger, orange peel). I think it could honestly do without the orange peel but either way it's very easy to drink a sixer. Will definitely anticipate this beer for next winter.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Lots of sticky lacing left by the head. Not much lacing as I drink it. Head is easily resurrected with a swirl of the glass.  S/T - Yeasty, bread aroma. No trace of winter spices in the smell. Light flavor. Sweet caramel malt. Slight hop bitterness in the aftertaste. The winter spices are barely present in the flavor too, which is more refreshing and appreciated.  M/D - Light-bodied.

So transparent, you could almost read through it.  Light spice, malt and hops in the aroma.  Fairly dry, with a light sweetness of malt, and a more pronounced hop bitterness. Nothing over the top. Surprising burn of alcohol for then 5.8% ABV. Light spiciness at first that's overpowered later by the pleasant hoppy flavor.  Thin for a winter brew, but pleasant.  Way, way drinkable.

Served on tap at Rachel's Roadhouse with meal.  A--Orange with hints of red in the hue. Some lacing in the glass  S--spicy esters, cinnimon, nutmeg.  T--Not bad, get some caramel notes towards the end, spicy, but not a real big flavor profile.  M--A little thin but fine.  D--It is what it is.

I have had this several times this year and this brew is really starting to grow on me.  It's a nice amber/dark copper color with a respectable light tan head.  Aromas are lightly spiced on solid malt smells wafting out of the glass. Hops are back seat but present.  Tasts as it smells. Solid malt, hops, and spices present and very equally balanced. I typically do not like spcied brews, but this one is nice and mellow, equally malty, and very sessionable.  Mouthfell is medium+ for a lager, a bit light for abock, but works very well to make it sessionable. Carbonation is medium/appropriate as most SA products.  I will look fwd to this seasonal in years to come. One of the better seasonal offerings by BBC/Sa in my opinion.

Heavy lacing and very high carbonation apparent.  S: Fairly faint nose which I found surprising. A little breadiness which just a hint of spice to it. Pretty average.  T & M: Medium bodied creamy mouthfeel. Taste just slightly on the thin side but definitely malt dominate, the slight spiciness from the nose comes through in the finish.

35,101,infi,3.5,"Poured into a nonic pint.  Pours a translucent and hybrid ruby red/dark caramel brown color, which forms a thick off-white foamed head. The carbonation is easily seen throughout the glass, as it's not too dark in appearance. Fairly translucent as well. The head's foam creates a nice amount of speckled lacing all around the glass too.  Smell is particularly heavy in roasted caramel malt like the Oktoberfest, but also has some hoppy scents to it and a nice nutmeg spice characteristic. Under all of these scents is a slight metallic undertone. Taste is quite pleasant surprisingly. I've had so many of these, but straight from a bottle, so poured into a glass created quite a difference. Upfront the palate is hit with a beautiful nutmeg, cinnamon and slight peppery essence and eases nicely into the bready malt. A very minute hop bitterness is discerned through the end as well as more bready flavors.  Mouthfeel is nice and crisp, but just a bit substantially thicker than other traditional lagers. Good for the style. Coats the mouth very well and lingers for just a few seconds. The drinkability is decent - I honestly don't see myself having more than one or two of these for a night, but it's still very pleasing.

The aroma does not stand out for me; I get a slight lager smell and little else.  Winter Lager is the most frequently rated bock on this site, and consistently it is rated above average. Based on taste, I agree. The malty sweetness stands to the fore front, but taste relies heavily on the added spices cinnamon and ginger.  The mouth feel is light to medium bodied with little carbonation. That's OK, it doesn't need a lot of bubbles.  Drinkability is good.

Light sweet alcohol smell in the tail end as well.  T- Very bready and sweet caramel malts right upfront. Light almost bitter hop in the tail end of this beer. Light hints of darker fruit (raisin or prune) throughout the whole beer. Not bad tasting until it warms up.  M- Medium mouthfeel. Carbonation is good for the beer. Clean tasting the whole way through. Sweet malts left on the tongue and aftertaste after each sip. Kind of watery in the mouth a little.

35,101,alkemy,3.83,"Dark amber pour hinting of ruby. The malt dominated the spices. There was an earthy hops aroma, but it was fairly weak. Cinnamon and nutmeg are there in weak amounts. It's malty sweet and the spices are hinting...it's tough to pick out a single one. This is actually a good thing. No single flavor overpowering another. Nice and balanced. I've always enjoyed this, but I was more fond of it this year than previous years...maybe it's my fancy pants Sam Adams glass I just got!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,WWWade,4.1,"Sam does it again. The change of seasons brings new weather and new beer. For the past few winters I have been excited to try all of Jim's new brews almost as much as a child getting giddy about opening christmas presents. I have to admit that I prefer dark full-bodied beers. This is surprisingly a very drinkable and smooth beer. Making a smooth drinkable full-bodied beer is not easy, but Sam Adams does this better than most. A- perfect head and dark  S- not strong, but not weak. Honestly I don't have a great nose. It is usually stuffed up, so I'm sorry.  T- Smooth with perfect carbonation.  M- rich  D- Amazingly drinkable. I had to slow myself down as I could hardly contain myself.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Clockwork420,4.03,A - An awesome brown rusty amber. With a perfect 3 or 4 mm light cream head. Nice bubbles around edges of glass. Looks great.  S - Sweet flowery. Hints of rust smell. Bread. Fruit. Sugary.  T - Creamy and smooth. Perfect carbonation. Rusty taste almost. Alcohol ting. Sour aftertaste. Only downside.  M - Feels right. Carbonation is not over powering. And neither is the balance. Slippery and easy to drink. The after taste is something I could get rid of though.  D - I only drank one but the drinkability is fairly high.  Cant say very much negative about this one. Except that the after taste is kind of sour and lingering. But you would expect that from any brew in this type. Its just preference and nothing more. I did not dock points in any area that wasnt totally deserving and not a trait that cant really be helped.  Good beer.  :),Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Some slight fruity aromas as well.  T- Some light bitterness initially with a sweet caramel malt flavor in the finish. Dark candied cherries and spice show themselves throughout.

Quite the mix of cinnamon and nutmeg with maltiness more dominant than the hops. Slight touch of floral hops amongst the abundant malt. Medium bodied with a somewhat dry spicy finish...yummmm.  This is very drinkable as the flavors are all subtle and it is medium bodied with a medium carbonation.  My favorite of the Sam Adams catalog of beers(Octoberfest close second). Finally, a winter beer that is more interested in being medium and drinkable rather than overpowering.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Josievan,3.6,"Appearance: A semi-translucent dark amber color. Head is so-so.  Smell: Spices and malt intermingle, but overall aroma is not very strong.  Taste: Sweetly malty and mildly spicy. Its rather undiscernable what specific spices are at play. I detect more winter/spice characteristics than bock characteristics.  Mouthfeel: Relatively thin-bodied. Highly carbonated, as are most Sam Adams beers. Quite smooth if not for the carbonation.  Drinkability: This beer's drinkability score is a notch higher than its other scores because the alcohol is completely hidden and it goes down so easily.  Notes: My perception of this beer is about the same as my perception of most Sam Adams beers: not exactly a stellar brew, yet never a bad choice either. Not my favorite winter seasonal or my favorite Sam Adams beer, but a decent beer nevertheless.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Nice lacing.  Smells of hops, and spice, perhaps a hint of cinnamon, but smell is week.  Taste is crisp, malts, and spicy. Finishes dry with a little cinnamon aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is nice, some carbonation, and mild spiciness.  A solid winter beer, and very drinkable during the holiday season.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Most noticeable would be cinnamon and ginger. A bit sweet to balance this out and little or no hop aroma.  Taste starts off a bit sweet, definitely malty. Then come the various spice note and a little bit of a citrus/fruity flavor. Hop bitterness is minimal.  Mouthfeel is a medium-bodied, with a lots of carbonation.

S: The smell was very rich in hops, with light tones of cinnamon.  T: The taste, was one of my favorites for the winter season. I tasted a little bit of an orange peel, but overall the beer was just a fairly dark wonder of joy.  M: The beer was fairly silky, and left you wanting another drink.  D: I rated the drinkability low on this beer, mostly because of the seasonal aspect of it. During the hot summer months this would not quench my thirst.  Overall, great beer, and another solid attempt by Sam Adams, although I think some of my local breweries do it better. I highly recommend this to you and yours, as always, Cheers.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

I know thats far fetched but it really is a great beer. What I like most about this beer is the fact that although you can taste the extra spices they don't overpower the drinkability.

A bit fruity where dark dried fruits dominates. Some floral hops, but faint.  T: Full in taste, sweet and bitter at the same time. Dark dried fruits together with cinnamon and other spices.  M: The long-lasting aftertaste holds a lot of bitter dryness. The body is full and the carbonation is medium.  D: A nice beer, a real winter beer. In Sweden this is marketed as a x-mas beer - but this doesn't go to well with x-mas food (at least not swedish).

35,101,kratos69,4.43,"The winter lager, which was the last Sam Adams I had yet to try, got me extremely excited to try it. Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance - Amazing dark colour, with a slightly tan head, and mild lace that stuck to the side of the glass.  Smell - Potent hops, with slight notes of vanilla and what I suspect was orange or some other citrus fruit. Slightly spicy, as a winter beer should be, but by no means overwhelming.  Taste - Very hoppy, the citrus notes are more present in the taste than in the smell. Slightly sweet, and just enough spiciness to be pleasant. I experienced virtually no aftertaste, but I did happen to experience a number of flavors while sipping, including something of grapefruit and perhaps chocolate.  Mouthfeel - Very smooth, not as harsh as the Boston Lager, oerhaps not harsh enough. I remember trying a beer once, I think it was He'Brew Genesis Ale, which was actually too smooth to be enjoyable. This, however, was very pleasant.  Drinkability - I enjoyed drinking this beer. Heavy enough to satisfy, yet not so heavy that it becomes a chore to drink the beer. Would definitely get a 12-pack next time around.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Clear red amber liquid with more orange zinc hue around the rims, easily transparent. Whiff of nutmeg and ginger in the nose, toasted cocoa and caramel, close to white pepper at times, moderate apricot, apple fruit and close to zero citrus presence, it's really all over the place, sometimes smells like Dr. Pepper. Light-bodied with sufficient carbonation to churn it up into a larger presence. More metallic and herbaceous here with the malts, caramel and molasses a diminished force. Ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg remains strong, contributes to its overall dryness.

Thanks to Sweemzander for this bottle!  A - A moderate pour gives the Winter Lager a big, light tan/cream-colored head three fingers tall. Good retention and clumps of lace down the glass. The beer is a clear amber color with few bubbles coming up.  S - Lightly toasted malts swirl around with a small bit of white chocolate and vanilla with a nice caramel sweetness at the end. A little bit of spice comes out. Some white pepper it seems like. A dry flour-like smell on the finish hinders it.  T - The flavor looses a lot of the initial nuances the aroma has but ends up being better in the end. Toasted malts with a light caramel sweetness that is balanced very well by a smooth hop addition. The end has spice notes, particularly white pepper, and possibly a touch of clove. The finish leaves a lingering dry but sweet vanilla flavor.  M - Winter Lager is creamy and smooth with a well-balanced dry finish and a touch of carbonation bubbles. Medium-bodied, it's mouthfeel is probably the best part of the beer.  D - A good winter seasonal but one of the weaker seasonals from Saumel Adams in terms of their Christmas offerings. I'd stop at two pints too.

This beer pours a clear brown color with a vague rose hue to it, a nice cap of beige head sits atop early on but soon fades to a ring of foam around the outside perimiter of the brew.  The smell is primarily sweet and spice, no real hops to notice. Some lingering scent of ginger. Overall not as present as I would like.

Once the beer warms up a little, the nice aromas start emerging.  T: The ginger flavor starts right up front and continues all the way into the finish. There is a nice sweet toasted malt flavor in the background and there is also a citrus peel bitterness to the flavor.  M: The carbonation level is good and the mouthfeel is somewhat dry in the finish. It is pretty nice.  D: This is a one off beer.

Small head with almost no retention and doesn't really leave much lacing behind it. The aroma is almost non-existent. A little malt but that's all.  The flavor is mostly malt with some spice flavors in there. The malt comes first and some spice towards the tail end. Overall, its a little thin on flavor on mouthfeel.

S - Spiced malts, smells good, but not much more than that.  T - Malty to start, moving toward spices, and then finishing a nicely spiced hops flavor. Some underlying metallic taste however, which was enough to drop the score for me.  M - It is average, nothing more to say really. Does not impress me in either a positive or negative way.

Taste: I wasn't expecting much, but in comparison to SABL this is a step up. I could taste some nice nutty flavors and has sweet caramel flavor. You can tell the earthy and somewhat spicy hop presence that was seen in the nose. Nice and bready with some spices like ginger present.  Mouthfeel: A little overly carbonated and medium bodied.  Drinkability: This has a bit more flavor than Samuel Adams Boston Lager and was definitely enjoyable.

T - Starts off with a light malt sweetness, some caramel, toffee notes. Light spicing. Mid-stream gets more bready, not bitter, without any hop bite. Finishes with a yeast note that would certainly remind me of a marzen. Aftertaste is the only bitterness I would say is present. Generally, the taste is very light - an indication that perhaps this micro-macro isn't trying to take risks.  M - Moderate body, a combination of some malty sugars and just a bit of carbonation bite. Leaves behind a chewy grainy sensation.  D - Very easy to drink. Manageable ABV.

A: Pours a large 2 finger head that is pretty rich and slowly bides back. A very clear amber orange reddish brown color like the glass is made of rust. The head leaves a lacing on the glass as it fades.  N: Lots of sweet malts start this beer. Almost a syrupy molasses like nose, but just slightly. A slight toasty malt aroma also makes its way in there with a touch of nutty aroma. Some crystal malt and other darker malts really hammer out the aroma and finishes with a touch of some spicy earthy malts.  T: Starts very lightly sweet with some dark malts, a little but of a syrupy like molasses or some other syrup taste. Then comes some nutty flavors, almost nutmeg but not really, as well as some interesting crystal and other dark malt flavors. It has a strange toasty syrupy flavor to it that is pretty reminiscent of winter beers. A light crisp lager taste hides in the background as well. A slight spicy and earthy hop flavor bitters the palate but ever so slightly, perhaps more hops would be nice.  M: Medium body, not too light or heavy, good carbonation.  F: Finishes a little sweet still, a little drier would make it even nicer.

Taste: Some caramel sweetness, with a hint of nutmeg, which is countered by some orange bitterness. Decent earthy wheat taste. It's fairly balanced and pleasant, but all pretty muted.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and sturdy, with just the right amount of carbonation. Easy drinking.

Some orange. Spices were a little lighter than expected, but seemed holiday-ish.  The spicy hop profile is the best part, setting it apart from most bocks. I probably wouldn't have identified it as such if that aspect was milder. Claims to be brewed with spices and wheat. Probably cinnamon. I don't taste anything that the noble hops couldn't accomplish. Citrus notes as well. I notice a lot more malt as I go on. Mildly sweet caramel flavor. It's really fairly similar to Boston Lager, and undoubtedly shares a lot of the same ingredients. The finish was a little on the heavy side though.  Very nice feel. While I couldn't say much about the wheat in the flavor profile, it likely is a contributor to the rich and smooth body.  This is a well-made brew and a good seasonal choice. One or two is all I would want. I don't find bocks to be imminently quaffable. I got bored with it by halfway through the second one.

Has some interesting flavors and is actually quite refreshing.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,mklinger,2.92,"Served at a restaurant with dinner. Poured into an imperial pint glass. It poured a deep orange with a slight tinge of brown (like the burnt umber crayon). Minimal head, even with some sloshing around.  Aroma was strong on the spices. I get cinnamon, maybe a bit of cloves & nutmeg. Not much for hop or malt aroma.  Flavor was odd. More like spiced maerzan than the dark wheat bock it's been labeled as in the past. Just plain weird. Nothing like its taste in the past. I boggle at how the can call this the same beer as in past years.  Mouthfeel & drinkability are OK, though I certainly won't be buying any 6 or 12 packs of this this year. It's just amazing to me that they are calling this the same name as previous years' beer. In the past I've bought multiple 12 packs of the SA Winter Lager. Those were a rich malty, slightly spiced lagers -- great stuff. This was thin, pale, and overspiced, I thought. Quite disappointing, especially given my expectations from the past.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Taste was good but not great. Bit of caramel and toasted nuts noticed. Pretty malty beer. The body was a bit on the light side for a winter beer. Fairly simple to drink, not a beer to ponder. Easy beer to have with food or by itself. Another crowd pleaser from SA.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

(S)- A sweet/dry maltiness & spices  (T)- Malty, with an orange peel & gingerbread cookie thing.  (M)- Good balance & carbonation level. Festive.

35,101,JohnL9013,3.66,"Sam Adams Winter Lager has always been something I've looked forward to, but the magic has kind of run out this year.  A: Typical dark lager, looks exactly like the Boston Lager. Unimpressive head with reasonable lacing.  S: The smell is a little subdued. There's a hint of malt and spices and nothing offensive, but nothing crazy.  T: I was surprised by how similar this is to the Boston Lager this year. It really just tastes like the Boston Lager but with some winter spices added. Is it good? Certainly... Boston Beer Co. could throw out their Boston Lager and replace it with this as far as I'm concerned, but I am disappointed with this lager this year... it's just far too light for a true winter lager... I am really surprised BA could possibly classify this as a bock with its balanced presentation and relatively low malt content for a bock.  M: Easy-going, there's a tad too much carbonation, though, but very clean.  D: One area where this beer excels is that it goes down so, so easily. I could drink this all night and be quite pleased.  Where did the winter lager that I had from Sam Adams two years ago go? I didn't get to try it last year, but I remember trying it a couple years ago and it being a little heartier and more ""winter-like"" than it currently is. Sam's needs to rework this beer.

Average is the best word.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,BillyBoysPie,3.73,"From a bottle into a pint glass.  Poured a nice half-inch of head, off-white/eggshell. Dissipated, but left lacing. Transparent brown - there's not much of another way to put it. Perhaps a few ruby notes, but nothing major.  Smell is mostly malty, light caramel with a little bit of real maltiness coming through. Spices are next, they seem to only impart a spiciness as a blend, not to be singled out. A nice little bit of hops on the end to clean things up. Maybe a touch of orange from that.  Taste is very clean, as a lager should be. The spices don't muddle the hops and malt - all three play even partners in the taste. The hops are, in my opinion, the most interesting part of this beer - you get the nice caramel with warm spices, then a very clean piney taste mixed with orange. A well balanced example. The spices are what warms you with this beer - not enough alcohol to be warming you.  Carbonation is typical Sam Adams, but it works. Instead of being a heavy Winter Warmer style of beer, it's a crisp, refreshing Bock-style with spices. It's very light bodied and would be a great session beer for a cold Saturday evening - unless you want something with more alcohol.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

The aroma has sweet caramel malts and a touch of spicy hops. Some warming winter spices slide in at the end.  The taste is lighter caramel malts blended with some bready and toasty malt. Noble spicy hops make there presence known along with some cinnamon and subtle orange peel. The spices are well done in that they are detectable but not overwhelming.  The body and mouthfeel are rather light for the style.  Overall, this may be one of the better spiced winter beers I've had. With that said, it lacks the body and intense malt presence I enjoy in my Bocks and winter beers. This is much closer to a spiced Marzen than a Bock. Not something I would buy regularly but would be happy to drink if offered.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

35,101,MaxBrews,4.13,"Presentation: Bomber and a wide Pils glass  Appearance: Pours a perfectly clear mahogany. A proper pour gives this beer a large frothy head that is tan in color. Beautiful for that moment as the head dissipates at a moderate rate but into a beautiful off-white lacing.  Aroma: Orange peel, spices a decent hopping, bready malt, a fair dose of roasted malts and dark fruit. As this beer warms up an earthy spice becomes apparent which I'm guessing is a combo of the ginger and cinnamon. A really malty beer that is well balanced, combining a fair amount of hops, orange peel and winter spices.  Mouthfeel: A lot of carbonation and a moderate body and a dry finish.  Drinkability: This beer has that clean lager thing going on but so many little nuances of flavors it even turned on someone whose a bit weary of lagers. So drinkable too. I kinda just spent a good 40 minutes sipping this bomber smacking my lips trying to figure all thats going on. If you kept handing me pints of this I would lap it up.  That being said this beer more then likely won't blow any minds.

Taste is very malty at the start, with the same hints of orange and winter spices. Finishes with a touch of hops to lend some balance. Mouthfeel has quite a bit of carbonation and is pretty light bodied, in a way that almost reminds me of some spring seasonals.  Overall, I'd say that this beer is a very nice winter seasonal, I'm pretty sure it's to style, although I haven't had too many bocks.

The retention seems pretty good. Trace amounts of carbonation are rising to the top. The color is light than I was expecting for a bock, more of brown and quite clear when held up to the light.  S - Caramel, roasted malts along with some spice notes and hops hit the nose. Overall, not quite as strong as I was expecting.  T - Caramel and malts are definitely present. There is a nice combination of hops and spice notes. Again, like the nose, not as full bodied as I would have wanted but nothing terrible.  M - Medium bodied with ample carbonation. Into the mouth, the palate tastes caramel and roasted malts. Then comes a subtle blast of carbonation that cleans the palate for the spice notes and slight hoppy finish. A pretty smooth finish overall.  D - Like the Creamy Stout, this beer appeals to a larger crowd, and it seems to fit the bill. Personally, when I have a bock, I want something full bodied and heavy, especially during the winter. I understand what Sam Adams is putting out but this beer seems more like a fall/spring beer, not a winter beer or maybe even a bock for that matter.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Taste is primarily malt, just a little bit of hops, and not all that much of the typical winter spice normally found in this style.  That said, I like this beer a lot. Some winter ales are over the top with the nutmeg and spice, but not this one. Just a good solid, well balanced beer, and something I look forward to each winter.

The nutmeg and cinnamon meld nicely with the caramel malts.  T - So good, in a bottle this was merely an average beer, not sure what's changing on tap but this is very very nice. What a comfort-food feel, memories of Christmas morning arise with the cinnamon and spice complimented by the not-overpowering taste of nutmeg. Makes me want to chill in front of a fire on a winter day.  M - Medium bodied with nice carbonation, slightly sugary sweet feel that lingers in the mouth.

Taste is well balanced - toasty, biscuity malt body, light caramel sweetness, complemented by notes of fruitcake and herbal hops. Nutty and I think just a hint of chocolate in there. Finish is very lightly bitter, earthy, more of the fruitcake. Well balanced, quite tasty.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, moderate carbonation sits on top of a body that has a nice fullness without being syrupy.  Excellent drinkability - the earthiness is just a bit trying by the end, but still nicely flavorful and well balanced, easy drinking beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Very little head retention.  Smells of of wheat as well as spices.  Taste is a nice combination of all of the ingredients in this beer. I get the hops, wheat, and spices all at the same time.  I could definitely session this beer for the night.  Morey's Bottom Line: I'm not big on lagers, or Sam Adams for that matter...but this is a well crafted beer no questions asked. Fairly unique too.

Thought it would be a little more flavorful, but still ok overall.  M- A little watery for my liking, but not bad. Leaves a wet taste on the tongue with a fruity aftertaste. Resembles a Marzen aftertaste effect.  D- Easy to drink a few of, but not really a session beer. Good beer to drink with heavier food such as steaks and ribs.

Smell: Has the aroma of a macro to me, there is a heavy amount of grains with touches of wheat.  Taste: Had a big kick of malt as well as some ginger and a strong yeast presence that made it like drinking a big hunk of bread (if that was possible). There is some displeasing characteristics such as it being somewhat metallic as well as unbalanced hops.  Mouthfeel: Light yet crisp and leaves a full coating of dry powder in the aftertaste yet leaves the tongue wet.  Drinkability: Easily could session if it's your thing, will give it another chance on bottle but so far it wouldn't make it past more than one with me.

Body is a beautiful dark amber with ruby highlights.  S-sweet malts with a spiced up aroma. The spices seem a bit overboard in this beer but this was probably done to remind the drinker that its a bock but also a decent winter warmer with its cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger. There is wheat present but i was expecting more (the bottle emphasizes on the wheat.)  T-I love how balanced yet intense this beer is. Right off the bat you get a malty punch of flavor but its immediately balanced out with the caramel, spices and noteable bitterness. You can detect a subtle alcoholic burn if you let it sit on the tongue and drink it down slowly, this is where you get another hint at a winter warmer.  M-Medium-light bodied with a pleasant carbonated tingle on the tip of the tongue.  D-Easy to drink, easy on the stomach, nothing offensive about this beer.

It's very malty, with a lot of caramel, and it seems to be incredibly spicy. I'm okay with some mild spice in a beer, but this one is a bit too much.  T: The taste is better than the nose, that's for certain. The caramel and malt is quite up front, with the spices much more subdued.  M: The fizziness is rather light for a lager and it's rather full bodied as well. I haven't had this beer in quite some time and I found this to be quite impressive.

Kind of a subtle aroma, I could have used more.  Taste is clearly malt and grain driven. Semi sweet, but also some bitter hops to balance. I find some caramel and what seems like charred chocolate. Almost a burnt, carbon flavor. Strange. Very dry finish.  M: Quite smooth, good carbonation. Nothing too notable here though.  D: Pretty good.

S -- Pretty weak aroma, not much coming from the beer but some vague spiciness -- maybe some light cinnamon and bready malt.  T -- Flavor trumps whatever is missing from the aroma. Sweet, dark bread-crust, toasty malts and nuttiness with some slightly vinous character back, finishes with a hint of molasses that heightens the dark bread character. Spicy hop character blends with sweet malts in the aftertaste. No fruit character to my palate, but for the vaguely tart vinous character -- I suppose that could be orange peel, but I'd be reaching.  M -- Medium body with a soft mouthfeel.  D -- Very nice drinker for cooler to colder days and nights.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,bsp77,3.56,"Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Summit Pint glass.  Appearance: Clear, somewhat dark copper with reddish highlights. Thin off-white head. Not much lacing but the color simply looks hearty.  Smell: Faint fruity malts and faint winter spices. Key word ""faint"". But what's there seems good.  Taste: Mostly malt driven, highlighted by bread, toast, cherry and a slight wheat taste. The winter spices (particularly the nutmeg) are more noticeable on the finish. Besides for the spices and slight wheat taste, it is Bock-like.  Feel: Moderate carbonation, medium body, somewhat dry finish.  Drinkability: Nice, hearty winter lager with just a touch of spice so you can't forget the upcoming festivities. Of course, this isn't really a Bock. A Bock with wheat and spices?

35,101,SpdKilz,4.22,"Wow, saw these in stock at my local Bev Mo today and despite it being mid October and almost 90 today I couldn't resist picking up a sixer of these.  Appearance - Pours a dark red/amber color with over a finger of fluffy white head that dissipates relatively fast but is leaving some decent lacing on the sides.  Smell - Spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, and perhaps some clove. There is a definite sweet/malty scent to this also, after the initial spices wane away. Overall smells extremely inviting and I can't wait to dive into one of my favorite beers (one of my first craft brews that led me into the great land of good craft beer).  Taste - Yes! I missed this so much. I was hoping it would taste just like it did last year (for some reason SA's Octoberfest this year did NOT remind me of what I had last year so I was worried my tastes had changed so much my old favorites would never taste good to me again). This is for sure how I remember the brew from last year and it definitely has more of a cinnamon note to it as others have said. After the initial spice kick you get a toffee/malty taste at the end. Extremely well balanced for the amount of spices in it.  Mouthfeel - Medium mouthfeel with decent carbonation that ever so slightly prickles the tongue at the end of the sip.  Drinkability - Very much so. I can't wait for it to get a bit cooler outside so I can sit out in the cool autumn air with a jacket and enjoy a few of these on the porch. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw this today and couldn't help myself to having one tonight. I can't wait for the other SA Winter Seasonals to come out!

Smell: Its aroma is light with just a hint of spices coming though a modest, sweet dark malt.  Taste/Mouth Feel: The flavor has a good layer of dark sweet malt with notes of sugar, caramel and lightly roasted grain mixed with just hint of spices. The spices don't really jump out at you but they add just enough subtle complexity. The hops adds another level of leafy/spice and some bitterness for balance as well.

Categorized as a bock and on clearance made me pick this up, knowing I could still enjoy a few of these during the season.  Poured into Sam Adams Sensory Glass.  Color is a dark amber/copper. Clear. Pours about a 1/2 finger slightly off-white head. Fizzles down to a thin layer, more foam built up on the edge of the glass. Leaves some thick splattered lacing.  Aroma is sweet and malty. Definitely has the winter spices in it, but also has the 'bock-ness"" to it. A tad of licorice comes of the end and also some brown sugar. It has a very inviting smell. Really tempts you to drink it.  Taste: right of the bat spices hit me. Enough ginger to remind me of a ginger-bread cookie. Very malty with spices. Leaves a lager-like aftertaste (yes bock is a lager).  Mouthfeel comes off a tad crisp, but then gets very smooth, almost creamy. The alcohol makes its appearance here.

35,101,johnmichael712,3.83,"It's March right now, and I have one Samuel Adams Winter Lager left in my fridge from this winter, so what better time to review this beer than on a cold, rainy afternoon?  Appearance: Poured out of a 12 oz. bottle into a pilsner glass. Freshness date on the bottle is notched as May, 2009. This beer pours a nice dark orange/light amber color with a large white, easily and rapidly formed head that showcases the heavy amount of carbonation in this beer. The head looks to be fairly sticky, which it is, and it leaves a small amount of lace on the glass as I drink.  Smell: The nose of this beer is fairly clean for all of the spices in the beer, but is dominated by a musty ginger, bitter orange peel, and a hint of cinnamon. The heavy amount of wheat malt used in this beer is also prominent.  Taste: This beer starts out with a solid malt backbone, and tastes strongly of wheat malt with hints of caramel. This malt dominance moves to a moderate amount of sweetness and a crisp bit of carbonation that fades to a very spicy, faintly hoppy, bitterness toward the end with a bit of dryness and a warming feel due to the numerous spices and the alcohol. Along the way there are hints of orange peel, ginger, and cinnamon. Overall this is a good, malty, dark lager that seems to be a perfect fit for winter due to the spices, and I'd love to try this beer along with a gingerbread cookie.  Mouthfeel: This beer is fairly full-bodied, especially for a lager, and feels nice and smooth on the tongue. I tend to enjoy my beers with a little less carbonation than Sam Adams Winter Lager, but that's just my personal preference.  Drinkability: The drinkability of this beer is fairly good, although it's not really something I'd want to enjoy year-round. In the winter time, though, there isn't much better than relaxing with a few friends and enjoying a pint or two of the liquid embodiment of the season.  Notes: I've had a long history with this beer, and it was the first beer that turned me to the craft beer world. I still look forward to the coming of winter and the Winter Lager hitting the shelves, and my friends and I still like to reminisce about old times with the beer that opened all of our eyes to how good beer can be. Although this (obviously) isn't as good as it was when I first had it, it's still a deliciously perfect beer for the winter months, and I'll probably buy at least one six-pack every year for as long as the Boston Beer Company keeps putting this beer out there.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Honestly not that complex - a bit like a spiced up Boston Lager.  M - Full bodied and somewhat thick, but still crisp due to the moderate/high carbonation.  D - This is a very drinkable winter beer.

Alcohol comes across a bit stronger than it should for the average, and finish is a bit rough with hop.

35,101,becktone,3.38,"From notes 11-20-08  Eye: Nice look to this brew. The brew pours a crystal clear copper that supports a nice creamy off white head. Retention and formation are excellent, color is very nice. Too bad the label touts that this is a dark wheat, if thats so then why isn't there any haze from the wheat? Probably because they filtered the shit out of this beer...gotta please the masses, you know that they will never touch a beer that isn't sparkling clear. Lacing is pretty good.  Nose: Slight spiciness upfront, though I really wouldn't classify it as ""spicy"" persay, but there are hints of spices that were used during brewing. Some nice caramel aromas are found in this brew as well. A general sweet dark malt aroma on the top, maybe munich, vienna, or victory...something to that extent. This brew has a nice aroma, but it is just terribly uncomplex and one dimensional. On top of that, it is very weak. It smells appetizing, and better than some winter brews I've had, but its hard to give this one anything above more than average.  Tongue: The spices come through a bit here, but not much. Lots of grain flavor that I'd describe as harsh. Some of the malty and caramelly notes come through. However, now that I've got it in a glass it tastes more like the Boston Lager, looks quite like it too. On the other hand, when I was drinking it straight from the bottle it seemed to have a wider range of flavors. Some cinnamon does come through, as the back label states, more of it coming out in the aftertaste. Finish is kinda dry leaing towards some spicy hop character. Okay but I've had better.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability: As I've already stated finish is drier. The beer is medium-light in body with levels of carbonation that seem to be a little high to me, they scrub away and take the attention away from the more delicate flavors in this beer. This beer is easy enough to drink allright, I finished that 12er in no time...did I enjoy every beer though, was I happy to be drinking every beer?, no. I didn't look forward to the flavor of each and every brew, it was beer so I drank it. You won't catch me buying this beer again.

These spices blend nicely into the strong maltiness of this beer. This is definitely a cold weather beer.  M: Full-bodied and smooth.

35,101,MaineBirdMan,3.65,"For a seasonal beer I found this one to be quite drinkable. Often times holiday beers focus to much on the ""spice."" I enjoy drinking the pumpkin pie but would rather eat it. This winter larger is very easy to drink. The color is nice and the aroma is fine. I don't taste much of the spice, which I like. I just bought a case of it at a local beverage store and I'm not dissatisfied (hey, a case of good beer for $12, not bad).",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Mouthfeel: light-medium body, light carbonation. Taste: Winter spices subtle but present. Some sweetness on the tip of the tongue but finish is dry. Drinkability: Good beer. This is a seasonal that you can find in more bars than most other good winter beers and is often a fall-back for me in an otherwise BMC bar.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,BeanBone,3.91,"Appearance: Clear copper/burnt orange body with a finger and a mass of sticky, off-white head. It easily topped my Pilsner glass and left good lacing.  Aroma: Brown sugar and caramel malt with a decent dash of spices. A little bit of citrusy hops on the edges.  Taste: Bold, toasty malt with the spices providing decent balance. There's also a bit of honey that lingers into the aftertaste. Citrusy hops show up in the finish, but are still firmly behind the malt backbone. Occasional tinges of booze in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and medium-light bodied with moderate carbonation. Compared to the sweet body, the finish drys a bit.  Drinkability: Another relativity quick Winter seasonal from Sam Adams. While very full-flavored, Winter Lager goes down easily.  Verdict: A solid Winter seasonal and, at least in my opinion, one of Sam Adam's best offerings. A safe bet for a mellow, but still full-flavored Winter seasonal, Winter Lager is worth a try for sure.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

35,101,prototypic,3.98,"Appearance: It's crystal clear and pours a nice looking copper-amber color. Head is vanilla colored and about a finger and a half tall. Retention was on the shorter side and lacing was rather light.  Smell: It's overall rather light on the nose. There are some spicy notes. Mostly cinnamon and some nutmeg up front. That's followed by a very malty, sweet smell. There's some toasted malt that adds a nice element to it. Smells like there's some light hops that are mostly floral in character. On the tail, it's a little yeasty smelling.  Taste: Caramel malts are noticable initially and provide a somewhat sweet taste. It's mixed with a light toasted malt flavor. Cinnamon and other spices blend pretty well. Nutmeg is the only other one I can identify. Spices are very flavorful. Hops are light in the mix, but are definitely effective in adding some zeal. It finishes sweet and a little spicy.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied and goes down smooth. Carbonation is active, but provides a very nice crisp bite. Its no quite lush, but it does have a nice feel. Drinkability is very good. It's got a nice flavor and goes down very easy. ABV is modest and it doesn't intimidate. I could handle a few of these.  Winter Lager's a good beer. It's definitely nice during the cold months. Frankly, I prefer BBC's Holiday Porter and Old Fezziwig. I wish they put those in six packs. But, this is good beer. Definitely one to pick around this time of year. Easily recommended.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Yup, head gone after 2 minutes.  Aroma: Sweet, metallic, caramel, some nice malt in there. Not too strong though.  Taste: Malt, caramel, sweetness, some spice in there somewhere. Quite tasty to be honest. Hops are not very pronounced , but add a subtle bitterness to the brew. The finish is sweet also. Reminds me of a pilsner in some ways.  Mouthfeel: Crisp, nicely carbonated.  Drinkability: Quite drinkable. I feel like this category is the beers' strong point. It is tasty, malty, crisp, with a nice depth of flavor.

Sweet, malty distinctive BBC smell to it...I guess it is their proprietary yeast that I'm not a huge fan of, but most of their standard lineup has a very easily identifiable scent for me. This one smells like a double boston lager with some creaminess and spices thrown in.  Taste is malty with a lot of the sweetness replaced by hoppy and toasty bitterness. Not getting too many winter spices in the flavor.

Taste/Mouthfeel - Tastes of lots of orange peel like citrus flavors, some sweet caramel malt, and a little cleaner than other winter seasonal's. Dark chocolate with warm pepper like spices on the finish. Hop bitterness lingers a tad. Mouthfeel is a little thin, a little watery, crisp, and has a lite body.  Drinkability/Final thoughts - This winter seasonal is very good and allot more drinkable than the seasonal ales. I could enjoy about 3 of these, full flavored like an ale, but allot more drinkable.

There is some spice that is lending this sweet, almost perfumey aroma, with caramel underneath that produces a pleasent bouquet.  Overall pretty spicy flavor profile with sweet spices like cinnomon and nutmeg, but they are balanced. Some underlying malt sweetness keeps the spices in check and gives the brew some depth. A hint of hops towards the end gives additional complexity and some dryness.  Nice carbonation, lighter side of medium body.  Very good drinkability. A winter session beer dare I say?

I've had it before, and I wasn't overly impressed with it compared to the other brews made by Sam Adams, but I thought, ""what the hell...""  Appearance: Dark copper in color, a very thin head that reduced to an even thinner lacing that didn't really stick around.  Smell: A little like carmel, a little bit of a hoppiness to it in the back. I really couldn't pull a whole lot out of this.  Taste: Nice carmel, and again like the smell, just a smidge of the hoppiness to it. It was kind of sweet and reminded me a bit of a Scotch ale. Again, it tastes OK, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it (also, is it strange that it's named ""Winter Lager"" yet it's classified as a bock on BA?).  Mouthfeel: Solid carbonation, dried the palate nicely. Again, not bad - something I could live with and it didn't let me down, so I gave it the 4 as listed.  Drinkability: Again, I would give it a fair drinkability, but I'm just not a huge fan of this one compared to the other brews from Sam Adams.

Smooth, buttery and just a little roasty. Lightly roasted malt, with caramel flavors. Little bit of hop to carry the end, but overall the experience is sweet. A little dry and grassy to finish. Light to medium body, not too much behind it. Very drinkable and inoffensive, easy to session. Not much to say about this one.

35,101,Phillyduke,3.66,"A: 12 oz NR with a March 2009 ""Best By"" date notched on the label poured into a SA glass. Beer is crystal clear and a deep amber red with very active carbonation and a 1-2 finger head of dense off-white foam. Head shows decent retention and leaves some fine lacing as it recedes down the sides of the glass.  S: lager yeast, mellow holiday spices (cinnamon and ginger), rich caramel malts, and a touch of herbal graininess.  T/M: Medium-bodied with a smooth sweetness from the caramel malt balanced by the less-than-aggressive spicing and hop back bite. No one flavor is really taking the lead, rather they all blend together quite nicely and evenly. Malty sweetness builds at the front over time, but a slightly dry finish remains. Gentle carbonation tingles the palate.  D/O: Although this is classified as a bock, I'm reviewing it against a style I feel is more suited for comparison: Winter Warmers. To that end it's a tasty, accessible winter brew that should appeal to the masses, but compared against other better holiday spiced beers, it's rather unremarkable. These are great to keep on hand during the yuletide season for those that may be put off by more aggressive or powerful seasonal offerings, and the drinkability is high for those times you want to have a few throughout the course of a winter's evening without thinking too much about what you're drinking.  That being said, there are better holiday spiced beers out there, which is a shame, as I understand this isn't nearly as ""big"" a beer as it used to be.

Nose is good balanced combo of rich malts, spices and hops. Taste is good and is a nice change from some of the over produced holiday beers. It is smooth and balanced on the palate with a combination of moderately rich malts, sweet caramel, holiday spices and a nice hop bitterness.

Minimal bitterness near the end helps this beer finish clean.  M-Medium-high carbonation, with a medium body bordering on the light side. Leaves my mouth feeling crisp.  D-This is a good beer, very drinkable and a classic winter seasonal. This beer probably has a lot of nostalgic appeal, as it's one of the earlier craft beers that I encountered.

35,101,GWaters,3.3,"As far as Winter/Holiday beers go, the Sam Winter Lager is a hesitant winter beer. I do find some spiciness, and fruit, but not enough to categorize this as a winter beer - in my humble opinion.  That stated, I do think this beer is very drinkable, and enjoyable. For the money, I would still go with the Sam Adams Winter Porter, or Old Fezziwig.  Pour: Dark amber with a slight eggshell colored head that leaves some lacing.  Smell: Light spiciness, maybe some orange peel, floral hops like regular Boston Lager. Not an obvious winter/holiday ale.  Taste: Smooth but basically tastes like a toned down Sam Adams Boston Lager. Just a touch of spiciness, not really detecting the cinnamon, but there is something in there. If you serve at room temp, you may get a bit more malt out of it.  Drinkability: Pretty drinkable because its smooth and light but nothing interesting.  This beer is average in my opinion. It doesn't take any risks, and just gets by as usual.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,diabecktic,3.88,"Appearance: This beer is quite aesthetically pleasing, to say the least. The beer itself is a transulcent dark shade of red - almost like a ripening black cherry. The tan head (~1.5 fingers thick) has great formation, retention, and lacing.  Smell: The label describes it best. It's a very hoppy smell that's accented with mild citrus, cinnamon, and spice tones. As expected, the spice most closely resembles ginger. Overall, it's fairly strong.  Taste: The taste matches the nose well, but the balance seems to be skewed a bit. Hoppiness dominates (like many of the Sam Adams lagers) and then fades into the malt. The cinnamon flavor is stronger than the smell would indicate.  Mouthfeel: Someone below said the brew is ""chunky"" or ""chewy."" I'd say that it's quite thick, but not THAT thick. A tad creamy - apparently characteristic of the boch.  Drinkability: This is definately a sipper. The flavor is excellent, so you don't want to drink it too quickly. I don't know if I'd call it a ""dessert beer,"" but drinkability isn't that bad for a thicker beer.  Summary: Just what I'd expect from the Boston Beer Company. I don't know how unique this brew is in terms of a winter seasonal, but it's put together very well. It's said that you must look at the whole picture to appreciate it; you would be wise to do the same with this one. It's quite hearty and will definately keep you warm during the cold months - a must-try.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Anyway...  Dark bourbon body in this one - almost an amber hue. Head is very flat and really just a little wispy.  Slight spice is pleasant - this one could be on the path to a Winter Warmer with a more copious dose. Lots of cinnamon and nutmeg but brings about a dry sensation. Hops and their accompanying pine are a little subdued. Malt carries an almost Marzen character.  Taste really follows the nose here - husky, spicy sweet malt with a little hop pine and spice of the seasons.  Finish is warming yet quenching at first, but the bottom of the pint gets a little heavy.  I tend to be a fan of the Sammy seasonals - no exception here. Solid session effort.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,everetends,3.07,"12 oz bottle from the Sam Adams mixed holiday case. Served up in a pint glass.  A: Pours a pretty nice, amber/brown. When held to the light a nice orange/red color comes through. A vigorous pour yielded about a finger of head but it disappeared quickly. No lacing to talk about at all. This brew is pretty mediocre and a bit boring in the appearance area.  S: Smell is mostly of some ince caramel malt and undefined spices. There is a slight bit of hops citrus coming out as well, but most of the scent is of a basic bock.  T: Taste is a bit better. Tastes like supped up boston lager. A lot more caramel malt coming out with just a touch of grapefruit hops flavor. Soices change things up. A decent amount of nutmeg and ginger. There is also a buttery, nuttiness toit as well. Damned tasty.  M: Medium in body an a bit of wateriness to it. ABV is not noticable at all. Carbonation is a bit lower than I expected. The brew does have a crispness to it and goes down pretty clean with little aftertaste at all.  D: Pretty drinkable. Really nice session winter brew that goes down easy with decent flavors.

The head dissipates into a wispy layer of bubbles on top and a thin ring around the glass. Lacing isn't very sticky.  Smells of caramel malt, diacetyl, and light spices as the beer warms.  Tastes similar to how it smells. Sweet caramel malt flavors up front are followed by light buttery diacetyl flavors and even lighter toasted malt. Spices come out more as the beer warms, and there's a very mild bitterness to end things.  Mouthfeel is good. It's light, but not overly so.  Drinkability is good - though it's best when the beer is about cellar temperature. Be sure not to let this one get too cold.  Overall this is not significantly better on-tap, although I kind of get the impression that the tap lines might not be the most clean in the world.

Smell: Very artificial sweetness; almost like the smell of Nestea artificially flavored raspberry iced tea, but as a beer.  Taste: Like sugar-free candy; at least the taste of artificial sweeteners are pretty characteristic. Slight notes of citrus, apples, cloves, bread. Strange hop bitterness at the end to round it out.  Overall: Like most Sam Adam brews, I'm not quite a fan. Their attempt to make micro-brewed taste with macro-brew practices lands them somewhere in between.

The smell was hard to quantify perhaps due to the restaurant surroundings but light malt and even a lighter spice were present. The taste was first sweet malt (caramel?) and spice (nutmeg, allspice?) with a very light hop finish overshadowed by the spice.

Smells of light spices and a mild piney character.  Taste is similar to the smell, definitely a bit spicier than your average Sam with added notes of citrus and caramel.  I've started the Christmas meal off with one of these for the past couple years and it complements the heavier menu nicely which apparently is something they were aiming for with this brew. You could easily drink 2 or 3 with the course of the meal although I usually move on to something a bit heavier after the first glass.

Very malty with a toasted breadiness, caramel, a little clover honey and maybe some orange/citrus and a hint of cinnamon. Spices are very subtle though. Some balancing hops show up at the end. Overall its sweet and malty, yet ends up being pretty well balanced by the time you finish a sip.  Mouthfeel is good, typical of other Sam Adams products. Medium body. Not too filling.

Medium malt aroma (lightly toasted bread. Low note of chocolate and some alcoholic presence. Initial bready notes are more wheat like but fade quickly after each pour. Very clean lager character. NO diacetyl, very low esters and no DMS expressed.  Flavor of malt is moderate and a bit similar to Klostritzer Swartzbier. Lightly sweet and bready with low German Noble hop flavor (spicey) Very evenly balance with only a little bitterness in finish - giving a nice crisp ending and adding to its excellent drinkability. Overall a bit of Munich like malt character that suggest some sweet (lower heterocylcics) melanoidins. Nice addition to its complexity.  Body is slightly more than medium (wheat) and carbonation is moderate. Alcoholic warmth is noted (and appreciated today!). Not astringent. Overall roundness on palate gives a slightly creamy Mouthfeel.  A great session beer. Heartier in body and flavor but a bit short of the ""Dark wheat Bock"" indicated on its lable. Wheat does add to the body of this very clean lager and the noticable alcohol is well supported. Elegant balance with a micro-burst of bitterness to clean away any residual sweetness (very low)  Spices are understated and difficult to characterize.

The taste is pretty mellow, but nicely integrated with gentle malt, light spice, and a clean minerality and slight lager twang. Smooth and mellow in the mouth with a bit of spice on the finish and just a hint of chocolate. Pleasant and easy to drink, but somewhat forgettable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Vendetta,3.32,"Original Rating Date: October 24, 2008  Pours a bronze/brown with an orange tint. Thick, white head. Smells super malty. Tastes of a bit of clove and wheat, mostly caramel malt, a bit vinous. No hops to speak of. Adequate carbonation- something that BBC always seems to get perfectly right. Very good stuff, here. Try it out.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,thain709,3.97,A - A nice copper body...very little head that left no lacing  S - A nice whiff of sweet roasted malts...a little hit of some other spices in the background  T - Very well blended between the malts and spices...a sweet malt flavor that has hints of caramel...is there chocolate there or is it just the caramel sweetness?  M - Medium body...creamy and smooth  D - I could easily have a six pack of this...balanced just right between the sweetness and creaminess,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,droomyster,3.92,"This was the third of several different beers that I had at tonight's party and was one of the most pleasing of the bunch. Poured a dark amber with a soda pop head that doesn't lasts but gives off yummy aromas of cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon??? and other spices that are very enticing. Tastes like all of the above spices compressed into deliciously toasted malts that are well-backed with citrusy hops. Nice enough feel but I agree with the recent reviewers below who would've preferred that it be heavier. Overall: probably one the best you can find at a major supermarket for next couple of months.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,malcontent,4.23,"Has the beautiful, amber hue of a classic Vienna lager (just like the flagship brew...) with a generous head that leaves behind copious lacing.  Honey and grain chaff give way to nutmeg. No adjunct odors and a nice clean finish. Nice.  Rich, malt-laden palate with caramel and clove on the back end. Not as rich as other bocks but full-bodied and clean for a holiday beer.  Perfect mouthfeel for a beer of this kind with controlled carbonation and appropriate body. When SA gets one right it really gets one right. I still think too many of their beers suffer from an insistence to try everything, but their hits (Boston Lager, Black Lager, Oktoberfest) are excellent. Maybe they should just stick to lagers...",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,bobsy,3.63,"12oz bottle. Cheers to Shawn for sharing on another great evening of games.  Pouring Winter Lager results in a copper body with a sticky tan head that laced well and exhibited good retention. The aroma is full of toasted wheat, earthy and natural, with strong notes of nut and mulling spices.  Nice sweet malty flavour with some restrained spicing to back it up (typical mulling mix), and a slight bitterness to add a refreshing bite to the finish. Caramel and wheat lead off, and there's a strong citrus presence that compliments the hints of ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg excellently to provide a very wintry feel. A medium body and matching carbonation doesn't put a foot wrong, but doesn't make you sit up and take notice.  This is a pretty neat winter offering, and I'd happily have it again. However, I don't think it's the kind of beer I'd be likely to hunt down, as I do see room for improvement in the nose and flavour, and have found beers that carry off this style better.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,AgingWarrior,3.89,"Poured a pretty dark caramel color in my beer mug. Hard pour produces a half a finger of light tan head. The head dissipated rather quickly and provided very little lacing.  Smells of caramel malts and spices with a hint of hops.  Tastes a lot like it smells. Sweetness from the caramel malts, some toasty taste and various spices.  Medium carbonation, creamy and smooth feel.  Easy to drink lager. I've had several of these at one time and enjoyed them all.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Augustiner719,3.79,Poured from a 12oz bottle into a 16 oz pint glass.  Appearance: This beer has a nice dark amber color that is very clear and shows little hazyness. It yielded a nice 1.5 finger head that was very creamy and white. It had nice lacing and the head lasted for a long time while leaving a nice thin layer of white froth for the duration of drinking the beer. Not as dark as I would have expected from a winter lager.  smell: It smells of nice roasted malts and has a hint of caramel and sweetness as well.  Taste: Its got a little bit more carbonation that i would have expected/wanted from a winter bock style beer. Its nice and full bodied with fresh tasting malts and hints of citrus on the back end.  Mouthfeel: Its a little thinner than I would have expected this beer to be after yielding such great aromas and flavor profiles. Its a little bit syrupy on the mouthfeel as its texture coats my mouth.  Drinkablilty: This beer is definately a go to beer for nights where I want to have a few beers during a game. Its full of flavor and it has a decent amount of alcohol that it hides pretty well. Overall I would buy this beer again and again but if you were looking for a more serious winter bock I would search elsewhere.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,albern,4.05,"This is a very nice bock beer. It pours a nice deep amber color with an off white creamy head that laces and retains quite well. The nose on the beer is sweet malts, very sweet, raisins, maybe a little nutty hints, some orange, some nutmeg type spices. The nose is quite nice.  The beer is very creamy, nicely carbonated for a bock beer, has a burnt brown sugar, roasted sweet grain flavor. There are ample nutmeg type spices, maybe a little nuttiness in the background. There is a bit of a hop presence right at the finish, but the sweet malts, the roasted grains, the raisiny sweet fruits, the burnt or charred brown sugars, the creaminess throughout, and the medium bodied, sweet orange peel presence amply defines this beer. This is surprisingly good. I've turned away from many SA products because they are sometimes pale imitators. Not so this bock beer. It is quite good and well worth seeking out.

It was served to me with a thin whisp of white froth.  s: Sweet, sugary malts; mild overall.  t: A bit on the sweet side, sugary caramel.  m: Fine for the style.

35,101,JRed,3.38,"Dark transparent caramel color with small white head. A quite unpleasant aroma of sugary, syrupy, molasses with dark fruit tones. The taste is one of a traditional bock but downgraded with massive amounts of sugary sweet syrup. Deep dark fruits with some medicinal characteristics and Aunt Jemima syrup to top it off. There's an aspect of artificiality that revolves around the drink that turns me off like a Runts banana compared to a real banana.

35,101,Colt4540,4.01,"A- Pours with a good 1 to 1.5 finger head that leaves fairly quickly but leaves nice lacing. Colors is about the same color as a brown beer bottle. The head is a creamy off white. Very nice.  S- Smells of toasted malts, has a sort of sweet gingerish cinnamon smell nothing to powerful.  T- It has a fairly sweet taste that goes along with the ginger smell I can't taste much cinnamon. Its sweetness isn't enough to out do the nice toasted malt flavor and hop bitterness that comes through at the end it is a very nice combination.  M- Medium bodied with moderate carbination very smooth.

(Hello...spice...I'd like to see a bit more of you) A bit of hop backbone for balance and a clean finish. A bit of citrus on the aftertaste. Refreshing overall  M-Well balanced carbonation and feel  D-Good overall effort. Very drinkable and enjoyable. Won't wow you, but will not disappoint either. Well done. I would have liked to see a bit more head retention, and some more robust nose, but I very much like it notwithstanding.  Re-review...drank a lot of this over the winter, bottled and on tap, and it was solid all around. Like most of Jim's beers, I'd like to see it taken up a notch, but kudos to him for what he is doing, and I must remember he is brewing for the masses. SA seasonal is usually the only viable choice in the sea of macros available at such places as Fridays. I definately prefer Winter over the standard SA Boston.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

S: Toasted bread, grass, pepper and a bit of toffee are what came through to me.  T: Toasty and dry, with maybe a touch of the label mentioned cinnamon hiding out in the back. Bitterness has a pepper quality. Finishes with a bittersweet toffee flavor.  M: Medium-light body feels a touch watery. Carbonation level is about right.  D: Tastes pretty much like I remembered from when it first came out. Not too terribly interesting, but a good session beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,OtherShoe2,3.73,"Received a clear deep orange pint with a decent white head with some retention and lacing.  Smells a bit of sweet malt, some hop leaf. Aroma is decently present, but nothing exceptional.  Sweet malt, kinda a toasted sweet bread/caramel effect. Some hop bitterness, and a spice in the background, but a mild spiciness. Decent, well crafted, but not knocking my socks off. Overall, good, enjoyable flavors with no off-notes and solid balance pushed this from 3.5 to 4.0, but that's really a fine line on this one (and I guess I'll give Jim Koch the benefit of the doubt).  Beer was decently carbonated and finished well. Was not overly mouth filling.  I guess you could have these one after another, but I couldn't buy a case of this stuff. Decent, but not over the top.

Nose is malty with a touch of spice. Taste follows nose with some additional caramel character and a light hops bittering at the finish.

M-Fairly straight foreward not very complex brew but good carbonation level.

35,101,CityBoy1986,3.98,Pours a chestnut colour with a foamy head that is gone quickly. Lacing is good. Smell is of malts and nutmeg.  Taste reminds me that it is the holiday season.

Active carbonation looks good. No lace.  S: Like a lager (malt-based, with a touch of toffee or caramel malt) with a hint of spice (nutmeg or cinnamon, maybe both).  T: First impression is that it's like it smells, more or less: like a malty lager (toasted cereal grains) with a hint of spice (mainly cinnamon, I think). After a couple sips, the drying finish becomes more pronounced, providing nice balance. Also feel a little bit of warmth in the belly from the fairly strong (for a lager) ABV.  M: Light-to-medium in heft with good carbonation.  D: Very good.  Notes: A good sessionable winter offering from SA.

It diminishes quickly but leaves a little lacing behind.  Aroma is a bit less remarkable. Sweet and malty with a bit of hops but nothin exceptional.  Flavor is similar to others in the mix pack, notably the fruits and spice of the winter season. Cherries, plums and raisins mix with cinnamon, clove, and ginger to create a pleasant, if not unusual, flavor. In a way, it's what a Belgian brewery might make if they did a dark lager.  Mouthfeel is good in that it's clean and well carbonated.

However, due to the taste, I'm not sure that I would want to.  -  I've had this beer at least once that past few years, and keep Overall, I feel that this beer lacks a true sense of what it wants to be. The list of ingredients in this beer sounds convincing, however they are imbalanced and seem to clash with one another. I think with a proper cohesion in flavor (perhaps more malt would work?), this could be a winner.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,BretSikkink,3.53,"Copper in color with a nice tan head. A little lacing, but the classic shaker pint isn't the best way.  Aroma and flavors of spicy, earthy malts with a touch of sweetness.

Chocolatey aftertaste  M: Good mouthfeel. Medium body, pretty creamy  D: Pretty good! Would've loved it if it had more of that bread-like taste and roasted malts. Nonetheless it's really good!

This is a beer that you have to have on tap to experience it's real potential, SA's Winter Lager continues to be my go-to beer on tap this year only because it's stayed the same over the past few years and BBC hasn't screwed with the formula.

35,101,Monkeyknife,3.82,"Poured from the bottle a clear amber with a healthy beige head.  Aroma of sweet malt, floral hops, Christmas spices (cinnamon and cloves), and biscuit.  The taste copies the aroma. Sweet malts along with the floral hops, Christmas spices, and biscuit.  Medium bodied, smooth, and moderately carbonated.  Not great but definitely not bad.

35,101,chaunur,4.2,"Poured hard at the bar in a pint glass. A wonderful honey color with a spirited 2 finger head that lasted forever. A nice aroma of sweet malt that was complimented with a flowery hop presence. Great tasting brew, just enough hops to not let the malt overpower. A hint of orange rounds it out making for an excellent flavor. The beer is rich and complex yet drinks easily.

35,101,treble,3.98,"The first time I tried this beer it was from the bottle and I hated it, ug, it was nasty, definitely a bad bottle, and it took me a long time to try this again. It was on tap at an Applebee's, and I really didn't see any beer that was striking me, so I tasted it again. I'm glad I did. I do like it, one of the better Sam's.  Looks inviting, warm dark golden color, fluffy head that dissipated quickly. Some lacing, though not much.  The smell was warm, the infused spices came through immediately, not strongly but noticeable presence of nutmeg and, faintly some other christmas spices.  I love the taste, it is also very drinkable, not at all overly spicy as i was afraid, but slightly, just hints, and it was biscuity, malty, well rounded.

Boozey hit hints at a true bock.  Nice medium roasted flavor gives a medium body. Wonderful nutty flavors give way to light floral hops that don't overpower the grain. There is a mild sweetness there that hints at a darker roast, but the grain bill doesn't reveal it. Nice all around, the alcohol is hidden well.  Medium bodied with a nice smooth carbonation.  This is one of BB's best! and I'm not afraid to say it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,kingothewoods,3.47,Had this one at TGI Fridays on tap. There was a nice creamy head that stayed with the beer as you drank it down. Dark copper color with tan head. Sweet malts and hops smells which come through in the taste. I like the carbonation and smoothness of this brew. One thing about Sam Adams beers is that they are full bodied - you can tell they take time in the brewing.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Amber-brown in color, with a rich, creamy off-white head that settles slowly to a thick creamy cap, sticking heavily to the sides of the serving vessel.  Nose is that of sweet caramel and toffee malt notes with some faint floral notes thrown in with the mix.  Nice medium-to-full body with a smooth mouthfeel that imparts a decent level of carbonation. Toasty, biscuit malt flavors dominate, with slight caramel notes filling in underneath, middling with just the faintest sense of hoppiness and finishing bready and somewhat dry.  Very drinkable, though much more breadlike in character than would be expected, and certainly falling behind in the flavor profile of the bottled version.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

It pours a nice darker amber color with a decent amount of head, and a bit of lacing but nothing special by any means.  It smelt great. Delicious festive scents bombarded my olfactory system.  Its taste was a bit of a let down considering the smell, but it was a decent brew with a, well, winterey kind of taste, which I enjoyed.  Like I said, i could only drink four in a night before moving on to something a bit better at the bar.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,RickS95,3.25,"The more Sam Adams I drink, the move convinced I am it's overrated. Their Cherry Wheat is outstanding, and I like the Black Lager. Other than that, if I never had another one, it wouldn't bother me. It's not bad beer, but for the money, I'd rather have something else. They price it like it's premium, and it just isn't.  The Winter Lager poured a thin tan head. The brew looks like icea tea or a light cola. It's filtered, which I don't particularly care for, but the color is nice and dark-ish.  The hops and spices are evident in the nose. It smells like it's going to be a strong-flavored beer.  It's unexpectedly smooth in the mouth, considering the smell. It's got good lacing.  Has a very simple finish, again a bit unexpected given what your nose tells you. It's bitter for a slight second, then it's gone.  The Winter Lager smells a lot like the Oktoberfests I've been drinking latly, but it's much darker, and not as bitter. I was suprised they couldn't pull more taste out of this beer, knowing all the spices and ingredients that went into it.  Not a bad beer, just not a great beer. Only slightly better than average.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,BamaBeerBuff,3.68,"A: Pours a very elegant amber color with an impressive off-white head that settles very slowly and leaves some really nice patterns of lace on the way down. Retention is excellent, with a solid quarter-inch of head remaining atop the beer all the way down.  S: The aroma is rather simple, but still strong enough to satisfy. A clean malty aroma (grainy, like Munich malt was used), just a hint of hops, and some notes of spice.  T&M: Caramel and grainy sweet malt flavor, balanced nicely with some hop flavor. Spices enter somewhat on the finish, which is sweet. Nothing earth-shattering, but not bad. The body is slightly heavier than medium with just the right amount of carbonation. I think it would be improved if they could squeeze a little more flavor out of it, but that's my only real complaint.  D: It goes down fairly easily. A good winter-time gulper, for sure.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Can tell it's a bock, good strong malt.  Drinks like a dark lager, or a lite bock, very nice.  Thinish as most Sam Adams are, this could use more body. But it drinks well, and is satisfying. I would say to them, save the additions, they don't really come through, just up the malt a bit. If you want a beer with good cinnamon/ginger see Great Lakes' Christmas Ale, are really good one.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Duhast500,4,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Sam Adams Perfect pint glass.  The color is a dark reddish amber a finger foamy off-white head and some slight lacing.  The smell is a little cinnamon and nutmeg at first. There is a dark malt flavor that imparts a slight maple flavor as well.  The taste is sweet at first, the malt is there to greet your taste buds as is turns over your tongue and gives off a slight cinnamon flavor toward the end with a touch of bitterness from the hops.  The feel of this beer is medium and is pretty drinkable. It goes down well and has a nice smooth feel.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

There is also a slight cinnamon aroma in there. Just a hint of nutmeg. T - Not as impressive as the aroma. Again the same apices make a brief appearance with some brown sugar in there as well. Some bitterness in the aftertaste to balance the spice. M - A little lighter then I expected but not too light. Adds to the drinkability of this. Not a heavy beer but not too light either.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Beergeeknut,3.98,Appearnace: This tasty bock pours dark copper color with red hues around the edges. With a light frothy head that does not stick around too long.  Aroma: Light ginger notes cinnamon notes float around so gracefully. Subtle hints of all spice. The aroma from the malts is nicely abundant.  Taste: With a crisp mouthfeel right out of the gate the sweetness of this bock shows up nicely. Hints of cinnamon and nutmeg are very subtle yet still there.  Notes: Well this one is still tasty and will more than likely continue to be. Although it is not pack a punch like it used to it can hold it's own rather well.

35,101,Soneast,3.7,"Pours a deep copper color with a 2 finger thick, tan colored head, that creams up to a nice layer floating on top of the beer. Some very nice lacing.  Smells mostly a sweet/spiced maltiness on the front reminiscent of candied dates. Definitely brings images of the holidays to mind.  The taste, not unlike the smell, has a nice spice malt up front, and you can pick up a little nutmeg or something in the background. Pretty mild bitterness on the end.  I'd consider this a medium to light bodied beer. It has a nice texture, and pretty tame carbonation. Very nice beer for this time of year. I could see myself picking up a sixer of these for Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Sweet malt with a dash of spice and orange peel. Cinnamon and nutmeg I can make out for sure.  Nothing fancy here, very simple. The balance between the spices, malt and hops is pretty good. Definitely siding on drinkability. The taste mimics the nose, with more of a bright citrus hop presence that leaves a mild bitterness.  Medium bodied, adequately carbonated.  Pretty easy to drink.

T - A crisp bite for the first second, balanced by sweet, smooth malt. Light hint of cinnamon, apples and orange zest on the aftertaste. A very well balanced flavor, full of character, but not too strong.  M - Crisp, but creamy at the same time. Doesn't linger too long. Smooth. Almost silky  D - I want to take it slow so I can appreciate all the complexity in the flavor. It wouldn't be a beer I'd necessarily offer to just anyone, as it needs to be appreciated as a whole.

The smell is a bit of a vegetable like malt, not too different from a typical amber. The taste is fairly well balanced with slightly muddy caramel flavors. Could use a bit more of a hop bite. There is a light to medium mouth feel, slightly sticky. This is a sessionable beer for when the mercury starts to drop.

T: It had a sweet malty front that was well integrated with bold winter flavors (cinnamon, cloves and allspice). It was very floral with a tangy bitter hop backside.  M: It was light bodied with modest carbonation and a tangy and lively spicy finish. It had a floral and sweet aftertaste.  D: I had a nice mini session that could have gone on long into the night.

Smell is more sweet then spicy. There are slightly muted hints of cinnamon and nutmeg, malty sweetness subdued overall with a burned caramel. Taste is all over the place, spice, sweet, malts all hit the taste buds. It's not a stand out beer - but one that you can easily go back to. Feel is lighter then expected in a winter lager.

I do love my kegerator.  Pours a pretty, clear, brick-red color, with nice autumnal hues of orange and brown as well. Decent head settles to a thin film, leaving bits of lace as it recedes with each sip. The nose is nice. Sweet malts with a bit of faint spices. Cinnamon, nutmeg maybe, with a faint trace of clove. The taste is nice and seasonal. But where other breweries go overboard with the spices, Sam Adams gets it right. This is not the best winter brew out there, but they achieve a very nice balance of sweet and spicy here. Good roasted, bready feel to it too. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but not overly so.  The Sam Winter Lager is a nice, highly drinkable beer. Nothing fancy, but they do a very good job here by keeping it simple and not trying to overdo it.

Mouthfeel: This brew is extremely smooth and crisp. Carbonation awakens your taste buds and soothes the back of your throat during every swallow.

T- Flavors of figs, dates, molasses, brown sugar and sweet caramel malts quickly fade to a rather bland and slightly metallic finish. I would have liked the initial taste to stick around longer.  M- Surprisingly aggressive carbonation and a slightly watery feel. I expected a more thick, rich texture with mild carbonation bubbles.  D- This is one of the less substantial winter beers that I had this year, but that sort of works in favor of its drinkability. I felt like I could enjoy several of these in a sitting. It's not overly spiced like some of these seasonal beers can be. There's no ABV indicated on the bottle, but I'm certain that it's pretty low.  Winter Lager is a decent beer, though there are many better seasonal offerings that I'd choose to enjoy on a ""cold"" southern California night.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Fatduck,4.43,"A great darkish tan pour, with a fluffy off white head. Tastes malty sweet with low hop bitterness. Id have liked if it had a bit more ABV, but all in all a decent representation of style. Full bodied and smooth, it goes down easy, and as we all know, Sam Adams makes some devilishly drinkable beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,pokesbeerdude,3.28,"A: Orange/red/brown, nice off white head about half an inch thick that faded to nothing after a few minutes. Ok lacing on the side of the glass, but really nothing spectacular.  S: Toffee, smells very sweet, can pick up a lot of malty smells, there are some definite spices as well, kinda hard to place, somewhat nutty, in there too. Very few hops are in the nose.  T: Initially I pick up some honey flavors, some roasted malt characteristics, an almost soda/sugary sweetness, a faint hint of alcohol in there as well, although not too far to the front. Really finishes clean, almost no lingering flavors. The hops are a little faint, but somewhat peppery in the flavor to me.  M: Fairly thick, but still nicely carbonated, nice clean finish. Pretty slick, and goes down well. A faint hint of alcohol warming in there as well.  D: Even though being quite the mouthful, this is a really easy drinker, I could have a session with this beer, simply because it isn't bursting with flavor and doesn't overwhelm the senses. Nice beer all around. But kinda bland in the nose and that translates to the taste as well.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,PhillyStyle,3.1,"Served on-tap in a true pint glass at Pub 71 (Atlanta, GA):  A: The beer appeared to be a clear copper-red color with a thin slightly off-white head.  S: The beer gave off a mostly malty aroma with some mild hops, nothing else of real note.  T: The taste pretty well followed the aroma, it had a nice malt/hop mix. I expected it to be a little more malty that it was.  M/D: The beer had a light-to-medium body, a little light in the level of carbonation, and maybe a little watered down. The beer was smooth and crisp and easy to drink. Overall an average beer, kind of par for the course with Sam Adams.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Natural510,3.85,"Pours a copper-red color with quickly dissipating head, leaving a decent lacing on the sides of the glass. Smells of malts, raw molasses and cinnamon. Dark Bavarian malt balanced by a mild hop note and a noticeable yeast factor. Sweet with notes of cinnamon & ginger. Full-bodied lager, crisp and refreshing going down.

D- could drink it for days. Light and crisp in body but great flavor.  well balanced and great for the non-beer drinker's seasonal",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,IronCitySteve,3.88,A: A redish copper coloring with a slightly off-white head. The head quickly disappated.  S: Not too much going on with the smell. An abundance of malt with a faint scent of spicy.  T: The tastes are more predominant then the scent would suggest. A good combination of caramel and bready malts and spice.  M: A decent medium body beer. Leaves a little slick/creamy feel on the mouth and tongue.  D: Not real heavy of a beer with a relatively low ABV.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,DeepSix,3.75,"Amber color, decent head, bout half an inch. Some lacing and a head can be retained.  A hint of cinnamon smell and some other assorted spices. Mainly malt and a bit of hop detected.  The spices are noted, but it is mostly malt, like the smell. Without the hops though, and I couldn't really tell cinnamon from the others. A medium to dark body, with a bit of carbonation.  Not a bad fall back beer during winter since this is pretty much everywhere, with a modest ABV you can drink a bit of this and not worry too much.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

The spices were mostly cinnamon it seemed. Overall this smelled pretty good  Taste: Spices came through some, and the malts too of course. It followed the aroma fairly well with some bitterness. Spices are used well, not overdone.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, but barely so. I felt like it was a little light for a bock. Felt nice though, and went down fairly well  Drinkability: Easy to drink, it tastes good and it goes down well. Low ABV for a bock though.

35,101,sevopie,3.92,"Appearance - Dark ruby in color with a off-white/tannish head that dissipates somewhat quickly.  Smell - Caramel malt with some spices and hint of hops.  Taste - The spices come a little more to the front in the taste, and the caramel malt is still present in the flavor. Lacking is the hops I thought I smelled, but its not much of a detriment to the flavor.  Mouthfeel - About average for a Sam Adams beer. Medium body with a healthy dose of carbonation.  Drinkability - I was kind of expecting a let down on this one, but it turned out alright.

Fresh and Crisp with a little...what is that....citrus...lemon, maybe orange? A few spices here and there.  T - Very good. Several layers are present with the entire mouth firing and having something to say. I like you Winter Lager 2008 but you are always good to me....aren't you. Taste is like a new beer just being made. FRESH and we all like fresh. Has the classic Sam Adams signature ""taste"" to it which is ok in my book. If it wasn't why would I purchase you from the local establishment? Sweeter than most Bocks but what is expected for this time of the year.  M - Good. A little heavy but good. The tongue sure likes you.  D - Since it is the holiday season, and there are sooo many wonderful beers to try, I will have to see you next year...unless I purchase another Winter Classic Sampler that is.

A- Malty sweetness, definite notes of holiday spices such as cinnamon. Some faint dark fruits aroma.  T- Very similar to the aroma. Nice toasty malt. Sweetness that lasts into the finish, not too sweet(cloying). The cinnamon aroma is not as present in the flavor as it was in the aroma.  M- Medium-full bodied with low carbonation.  D- A rather great winter beer. The spices aren't overpowering as featured in many other winter brews.

Clean and subdued overall.  T: Nice toasty caramel malt flavor, with a nice sweetness. Some earthy/herbal hop character provides a drying balance and a touch of bitterness. Some vague spice notes, perhaps cinnamon or ginger. Some grainy and somewhat metallic undertones are detectable.  M: Medium body with active carbonation. Somewhat slick and smooth overall.

Poured the beer into a basic pint glass and a really creamy and thick 2 ½ finger head formed. Showed a bit of retention before fading away. The beer was a clear dark amber color with a great deal of red highlights. Like cherry wood furniture color. A touch of lacing and no visible carbonation.  Aroma was malty and a bit sweet. There was a sense of spice but not really a great deal. Wish there was a more aggressive aroma to forecast what was in store for you.  Taste was nice and well balanced. Malt took center stage with a bit of a brown bread flavor. Some sweetness and dark fruit (Date/fig) fruit tones. Good balance of hop bitterness. I guess the spices where there, but not a main focus of the flavor. Like the aroma, I wish this was a bit more prominent.  Mouth feel was medium/light in body and slightly creamy. Carbonation provided a little punch to the flavor.  Nicely drinkable. A good beer, but not overly complex. I wish there was a bit more to it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,DoctorDog,3.88,"Presentation: 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. ""Best by"" date notched for March.  A- Rich, clear amber appearance. Pours with ~1 finger of white head, which fades gradually, leaving a thin ring. No lacing noted.  S- Very feint whiff of non-descript spiciness. The nose is impaired, so expectations are tempered accordingly. At any rate, what I'm getting is good enough to ready me to dive in!  T- Tastes like a really solid lager with some nice, complimentary spices added in. I am struggling to single out unique flavors tonight for whatever reason, but nevertheless, this is quite pleasing.  M- Carbonation seems high, and coupled with the spices, prickles the tongue.  D- Quite good. I could easily see knocking back a few of these in a row....

35,101,Mosstrooper,4.24,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 20oz Guinness tulip pint glass.  Appearance: A nice, deep amber color, but looks much lighter than most bocks. Has a pretty nice head- not too thick, but by no means thin- that dissipates just right- not too fast, not too slow.  Smell: Caramel malt with a spiciness coming mostly from cinnamon and other spices, with a slight hop spiciness.  Taste: Strikes a good balance between the hops and malts, with a bit more toward the malts. Somewhat sweet with cinnamon, other spices. Has a very pleasant aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Just enough carbonation, light to medium body. Very smooth.  Drinkability: Highly drinkable and highly recommended.  This is a beer that seems just right for a celebration and it may not be the best beer for the coldest days, but it sure is a winter beer. It seems to get better as you drink more of it, and it leaves you with a good aftertaste. Definitely worth the try and I know I'll be getting it again for special occasions this winter and hopefully for winters to come. Again- highly recommend.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,BirdFlu,3.77,"This was a beer that I really, really enjoyed before I got really into beer... That said, I was a bit afraid to try it again, as I didn't know if I would like it as much. It was a bit disappointing compared to my enthusiasm for it last time, but its not a bad beer at all.. Pours an amber colour with a bit of a copperish tone. Smells a bit malty, a very little bit spicey. Taste isn't too sweet for something of the bock family, but the bit of holiday spice is a very nice touch. A bit cinnamon-like, a bit ginger-ish. Its very festive and makes you feelt like its christmas time. I will say, again, I don't notice these notes as much as I did last time I had the beer, now that I'm more used to drinking lots of craft brews and ""extreme"" beers. Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side for a bock, but in general is simply a light moderate. Its crisp and has a good amount of carbonation. Its easy to drink with a good flavor and nice subtle notes. I suppose if you are more keen on really big flavored beers this may disappoint, but I do remember it being extremely enjoyable during x-mas time while its snowing outside. And I love the colors on the label.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

35,101,Tolnik,3.53,This beer of dark robust brown was poured into a pint glass. Giving itself a good frothing of head and a lingerence of lace. The aroma is a good mixture of cinnimon and hoppier beer.

Smell is of sweet caramel malts warmed by mild spice and clean hop scents.  This reminds me of a Boston Lager with extra malt and some mild spice flavoring, though no single spice seems to stand out. Very nice, caramel malts up front, not overly sweet balanced with a nice bittering on the finish.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, medium with a nice amount of carbonation.

The head retained well and left layer upon layer of ring lace down my glass.  S= I found a lot of malty sweetness in the aromas of this beer. Definite notes of caramel, cinnamon, and molasses, as well as maybe the tiniest bit of nutmeg.  T= This beer was clean and slightly malty sweet, with a subtle spicing throughout. The maltiness is full of rich caramel flavors. The spices are faint yet they add a lot of depth to what would otherwise be a nondescript beer.  MF= Medium bodied with a slightly oily smooth feel. Carbonation was crisp enough to cleanse the palate but overall not terribly high.  D= This was an easy drinking beer that I will gladly order again when I am at a ""non-beer"" restaurant. Moderate alcohol and good flavor make this highly sessionable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

A large inch and a half slightly yellowed head sits on top and lingers with good retention leaving a bit of lacing behind. However, most of the lacing slides down the glass, only the original collar remains.  The aroma is faint, but holds some promising notes. It's comes off kind of sweet, with some hints of spices (cinnamon and ginger), and a bit of citrus as well. Improves as it warms, but still doesn't open up a ton.  The taste is not as great as I remember, but fine. The dark malted wheat gives a nice grainy/cereal taste which dominates the palate. A touch of spice with the cinnamon and ginger add a little something to the profile that makes it take on the winter theme. Not overly complex or awesome, but I have a definite soft spot for this beer.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with fine but ample carbonation. The mouthfeel flatens out quickly, which normally I'm a fan of but not in a beer of this type.  Drinkability is high. It's a solid beer with decent flavor and easily enjoyable.

M/D: A medium body that is well carbonated for my tastes, and a good creaminess. Easy and smooth to drink. I could quaff a few of these.

The soft, grainy-bubbled head slowly recedes into a bubbly ring that doesn't do much other than scatter anorexic swatches and a few freckles of lacing on the glass.  The smell is toasty, fruity malts underlain by caramel sweetness and a little spice.  The taste is surprisingly rich and malty with a crisp edge of citrus and a toasty, chewy, grainy finish. A tingle of spice and a touch of drying hops linger in the aftertaste.  Like almost everything else from Samuel Adams, Winter Lager is a decent, solid representation of the intended style, but it makes its way softly, without kicking in any doors or breaking any new ground.

35,101,HalfFull,3.44,"Notes from 10-13-2008  Pours a clear light amber with a thin and fleeting head. Minimal retention and extreme clarity. Almost zero lacing.  Smell reminds me a bit of an amber with slightly roasted malts dominating the nose, and a bit of spice in the background, cinnamon and allspice. Surprisingly decent hop presence when agitated mid-pint, earthy but fleeting.  Offers a slightly dry and bitter amber-bock flavor on the palate. Lager notes are subtle given the bready texture on the tongue. This is both a blessing and a curse as the malt flavors hide behind it as well, with caramel revealing itself only after notable exposure and warming. Tastes like a supercharged Boston Lager with a sprinkle of hops and a more balanced malt presence, not all Vienna but it's surely there.  Pretty firmly carbonated yet the reduced bitterness makes this beer a bit more drinkable. Nonetheless the comparisons to Boston Lager are undeniable.

The beer pours with an inch head, and the beer has a dark copper colour to it. It looks incredibly clear with a fair amount of carbonation. There is a sweetness that comes out more when the beer is poured. The beer is sweet, bitter, and toasty. It's almost like an oktoberfest with a focus on complexity rather than drinkability. There is the usual lager crispness that is expected though. The sweetness tastes absolutely wonderfull. I'm really surprised at the great balace of the sweetness, bitterness, and toastiness, yet leaving some room for complexity. The mouthfeel is slightly creamy, but with a lot of carbonation.

I've had this one before, typically has a dark amber color. Pretty decent head but what really sticks out is the smell. Too many spices to pick up-- lots of malt, subtle hops, little bit of cinnamon, maybe some coriander? Tastes great, plenty of maltiness with a kick of hops to balance the aftertaste.

35,101,Asgeirr,3.86,"Appearance: Samuel Adams Winter Lager pours a copper colour along with small amounts of carbonation and a medium-sized yellow-brown crown which resides rather quickly and leaves barely no lacing.  Smell: First and foremost a caramelly, and to some extent citrus fruit/ginger, freshness.  Taste: Sweet and full maltiness, the caramel makes a reappearence -- and whadda ya know, it brought some friends! Namely a tad of sourness (the citrus fruit in the smell), the hops in form of a slight, but still farily distinct, bitterness and they all stay for the palate-party (even though some of them did make a late arrival) with great results!  Mouthfeel: Almost as creamy as they come, full and adequately medium-to-low in carbonation.  Drinkability: Oh how I wish this wasn't my last one (I have been saving it for almost a year now)! And I do wish so primarily due to the fact that it holds a balance between the -- almost -- equally satisfying smell and taste experiences, wich qualifies Sam' Adams Winter Lager as a definite ""let's have another one, eh?!""-er!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

The nose and overall smell is awesome. This baby hits you with lots of orange and spice zest. THe corriander is evident form the start and I am very pleased with this. There are more hoppy notes on the nose than malts but both are very present. The taste brings cinnamon to the game along with the orange, light chocolate and corriander.

(Yes, I drank this in the shower and wrote the rest by memory after my morning coffee). Out of the bottle this beer was a copper/amber color leaning towards the dark side with some visible rising carbonation. The head was tan, displayed nice retention and lacing too. The aroma was mostly spices and malt with some sweetness. The flavors were first caramel and chocolate malt blended with winter spices, nutmeg and cinnamon followed by a bite of hoppiness at the end. The suddenness of the hops gave the beer a slightly astringent quality. Still, the body was medium, the carbonation average and the mouthfeel good.

I tried it plenty of times but found it to be lacking too much in overall flavor. The appearance is beautiful and it is a good beer body wise, but the flavor department is just lacking way too much for me.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,vicg12,4.34,"Second best Sam Adams you can get. The flavor is very rich, and delicious. Highly recomend this beer. Has nice head and is good with a nice dinner of lets say steak and potatoes.

35,101,changeup45,3.47,"Dark amber in color with the spices that make it a good seasonal beer. I still prefer the Sam Adams Lager or the Boston Ale over this one, even in the winter. Spicy, malty aroma, medium tan head and a pretty good amount of lacing. This is a little more hearty than their standard lager. Malty and spicy with some sugar notes in the taste. A sour finish and aftertaste. A decent seasonal selection from Sam Adams.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Almost apple pie like. Nice, bright and very fresh aroma.  T-Sweet caramel apples, light cinnamon and a bit of nuttiness. Very light hop bite in the finish. The flavours are all there but light....flavours seem muted...age?  M-Medium-light body with a good smooth feeling. Slightly lacking in body for me.  D-Nothing crazy, more or less a bready, fruitier, spiced version of Boston Lager. This is fine non-offensive, tasty with a nice nose.

Poured a dark amber color with a thick creamy tan head. The aroma was spicy and malty, very appealing. The flavor was fantastic very malty and sweet with a well balanced mix of spices and citrus notes. Thick mouthfeel and the beer finishes creamy and smoooth. I would order this one again in a heartbeat.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

T: The flavor was dark rich caramel with dried apples and some nuttiness. This is actually a wheat bock with some holiday spicings (cinnamon, nutmeg) followed by a faint dried frutiness and earthy bitterness.  M: smooth and creamy with some warm caramel and dried apple fruitiness.  D: Decent drinkability with a good hearty wheat bock body and subtle spicings makes this a decent brew that along with a fairly low abv could be easily drunk in multiples.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Not overly carbonated.  drinkability- not the best Bock that I've had and not the worst, Its just alright.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,joshwlt,3.31,"Months ago I had this on tap when it was still a little ""chilly"" out here in FL and I remember it as being my favorite Sam Adam's seasonal (Can't wait to try the oktoberfest [at least that's what I think they produce in the fall, correct me if I'm wrong]). But just had it last night bottled (out of season it's late May); got it from the ABC liqour near me, so I'm guessing it was either sitting around warm or maybe went through some temp differentials that may have affected it.  Anyway, it poured a clear amber brown with a slight head that stuck around just lightly. At first it was a little roasty and included some spice flavor matched with some hops with a good balance; but as I drank more of it it became more and more yeasty, the yeast seemed to dominate the flavor for me and the mouthfeel. I was really expecting some roasted malts in this but was a little let down. The flavor made sense though because the label says ""a dark WHEAT lager brewed with winter spices."" SA seems to really like including wheat in all their seasonals. And again Sam Adams meets expectations, can't say I've ever been WOW'd but they always meet your expectations well.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

35,101,1099,4.4,"I wish this was available year-round, so I've taken to keeping a few extra bottle around to have during the summer time.  I sampled this for the first time this past Holiday season. I poured it from a bottle into a pilsner glass. It poured a very nice, very dark caramel color. While pouring it, I took time to sniff at it- and I was IMPRESSED to say the least. Smelled of winter spices and malt.  The taste was very impressive like the smell. It basically tastes like regular Sam with the extra spice. The spice definitley does the job of warming you up; I was feeling nice and warm and cheery after a couple of bottles.  Both mouthfeel and drinkability are quite good.

Smell is of malts, caramel, and holiday spices. Mixes very well and entices you to expect a lot from this brew.  Taste is an amalgam of different things. Orange, coriander, holiday spices, touches of wheat and grain alcohol all combine to create a very light and ethereal flavor that pleases.  Mouthfeel is creamy from the head and then crisp and clear when there's no more head to lend it some creaminess. Finishes clean and is a pleasure to drink.  Drinkability is rather excellent, it's hard to stop drinking this brew and I'm able to savor every last drop and look forward to this beer being re-released every winter.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,msolar,4,"Pours a rich amber color with an even head and lacing. Smells like cinnamon and nutmeg. Tastes smooth, just as it smells, with little-to-mid carbonation and a nice flavor on the palette. High drinkability. One of my favorite Sam Adams and a very good winter brew.  For additional Massachusetts winter beers I'd also suggest Wachusetts Winter Lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,ultralarry2006,3.13,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle. Leaves one finger of a tan head that quickly reduces to surface skim, yet there is some good lacing to be had. Body is a reddish amber.  Smell - apples and butterscotch fill the nose, and seem to me to be indicators of diacetyl. Under that, and mildly, there is some caramel, as well as some toasty malt biscuits, and some herbal hops.  Taste - much like the smell, with the apples and butterscotch flooding the tongue, along with herbal hops, as well as some spices. There is weakly, some caramel and malt biscuits in the middle. The finish has yet more herbal Euro hops, and it reminds me of the sort of ""skunked"" Euro lager taste, which I do not find to be too good.  Mouthfeel - medium bodied.  Drinkability - this is a merely good lager.

It has a bit of hops but not too much. The overall feel is that of a lighter version of their Double bock. The finish is smooth,sweet and dry. I like the sweetness, but unlike the Double bock there is no tingly sensation of alcohol. I like having a few of these as a warm up to Sam Adams Double bock or another Maibock.  Note: Why do they not give this beer some more muscle ? I think I would like this beer much more if it was a bit more aggressive.

Smell was awesome, smells of cinnamon, much like the label claims. Taste was a classic Sam Adams taste. All their beers have a similar taste with just a little tweaking, this beer is no exception.

A - Deep amber/caramel-colored body with almost two full fingers of creamy alabaster head that quickly receded into a ring of retention and left some nice lacing around the glass. Plenty of active carbonation livens up the body.  S - Strong caramel malt presence with a hint of brown sugar and molasses. Some faint winter spices in the back reminiscent of cinnamon and perhaps ginger. Not much of a hop presence in the aroma.  T - Sweet caramel malt and a distinct bready/cookie dough quality, especially in the finish. Hints of molasses, brown sugar and spices meander on the tastebuds. Only the slightest inkling of light, earthy hops are present.  M - Medium body with quite a smooth, round texture that's just a bit chewy for a lager. Carbonation is quite soft, which allows the creaminess to shine through.  D - This is one of my favorite offerings from Sam Adams and a great addition to the Winter Classics variety case.

35,101,MrIncognito,3.4,Not much head as is the custom at most bars nowadays. Clear dark copper with some carbonation rising.  Smell is faint but of wheat and slight citrus... either lemon or orange.  Taste is pretty much the same. Really didn't taste like a Sam Adams to me. Where were the hops in this beer? Taste was smooth with minimal hop bitterness. Slightly metallic and somewhat watered down. I tried to let this beer warm up as it was served very cold. Does get better as it warms.  Mouthfeel is smooth and wet. Carbonation is nice.  Overall this is a pretty average beer for me. I really like wheat beers but I think it just tasted too processed.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

S: Smells of sweet malts with hints of ginger and nutmeg.  T: A nice, light, malty taste with a sweet, malty aftertaste. Ginger and nutmeg were evident in the aftertaste.  M: A nice, full-bodied mouthfeel that was fairly smooth and well-carbonated.  D: Definitely a very drinkable beer. Great combination of mouthfeel and taste.

35,101,Gueuzedude,3.75,"Best By Date June 2008; Sampled February 2008 A vigorous pour yields a frothy, initially two-finger thick, tan colored head. The beer is a clear, rich cherry color, but shows a deeply cranberry stained, brilliantly clear, copper color when held up to the light. The aroma has a nice maltiness to it that is not quite rich (like a bock would be for instance), but it does smell a bit sweet with light toffee notes and it has a nice backdrop of toasty grain notes that accent a biscuit aroma as well as notes of lightly browned, crushed soda crackers. A light herbal hop character is here in the nose as well and there is also a berry aromatic that seems to be from the hop and malt interplay.  Well carbonated the bubble cause this to froth a bit as it hits my tongue. It picks up a sweetness pretty quickly that helps accent a light berry note, hints of sweet plums and even a touch of something like candied tangelo zest. This has a nice, though soft bitterness that mixes with a herbal hop note, both of which linger on a bit in the finish. The sweetness tends to hide a the toasty malt character that was noticed in the nose, but you still get more than suggestions of it at times; caramelized bread crust and biscuit malt flavors are also joined by caramelized malt sugars and a touch of toffee.  I definitely like the mix of berry notes, light herbal hop character, toasty malt and drinkability that this beer provides. It is rich enough for the colder months, but kept quite quaffable so that you could have a couple. This beer definitely hits the spot and I have always enjoyed it when I happen to find it in my glass.

35,101,bisoubisou,2.82,"Thought this would be a good first Ba entry considering that Sam Adams was the beer to get me started down this dusty road about 15 years ago. It's also winter - kind of.  Anyhow - I thought this was going to be a spicy ""lite"" lager so I was surprised at the first sniff that revealed bockness (along with some sort of rubbery something or other)... Nice and malty-sweet but the spices are barely there for me - which is just fine cause I prefer pie or mulled cider when I want the latter. Very prickly on the tongue and sneaky at 5.8%.  Would -like- totally go for another if someone offered it for free and there was nothing else better.

Aroma-malty,grassy,the orange peel is faintly detected and the hops are there, not too crisp. Mouthfeel- very clean taste,lively carbonation and the orange peel, ginger and cinnamon are so wonderfully done without getting aggressive.Subtle. Nothing takes away from the lager taste and JK and crew have obviously utilized a few darker grains as evidenced by the color.

35,101,BrewmasterNPB,3.83,"I had this on tap this evening while bowling (not that that matters). The Winter lager had a nice Amber color that I liked, but had no head. This was probably due to the glassware at the bowling alley, so I still gave it a 3.5 for appearance. If I were judging it against style, it doesn't taste like a bock to me. If I were judging it as a continental lager, or a European dark lager, it would get big points. The malty flavor dominates, but it's not too sweet. I drank it pretty quickly, so it must have been decent.

I really prefer Lagers or Darker brews (porters or stouts), but this just didn't hit the spot. (ales are out also...I do try them but, thats another story) I do not like to rate beers I try any lower than a C-. I will give another BOCK a try, the description sounds as though it would taste GREAT, but Samuel Adams Winter Lager fell short of being an example.

Mouth is left with a nice flavor after the sip that lasts for quite a while.  Drinkability: Decent beer but seems like it could be so much more if things were just pumped up a bit.

I remember when this beer used to be a little bit bigger, badder and ... well better. It used to be closer to 7% abv and with a lot more brawn you would expect from a bock.

Not very powerful.  M - Smooth. Light body. Not too lively. Really doesn't linger.  D - Not bad, not very complex or impressive tho either.

35,101,trentley87,4.23,"A: 12 oz. bottle into mug. Beautiful dark, but very clear amber with a slightly off-white 2 finger head. Dissipates rapidly but leaves generous lacing behind. A very attractive beer, the first I've had in this style.  S: Smells to me very much like the Boston Lager with just the slightest hint of spices present (I've got a slight cold). Fairly mild all around.  T: The flavor is excellent, plenty of malt sweetness and a slight breadiness balanced by the slightest touch of hops at the finish. The spices are especially present in the aftertaste -- sort of reminiscent of pumpkin pie IMO.  M: Creamy is the one word I would use to describe this beer. Is it right for the style? I have no idea! But it is very good.  D: This is one of my new favorites. I'll be drinking a lot more while Sam Adams is still brewing it this winter...and maybe putting it up for the fall.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Hatch,3.5,"12 oz pry-off brown bottle with freshness date on bottle.  Pours a dark red amber with a slightly off-white head about one finger thick that dissipates rather quickly into some decent lacing. I've had this style of beer before and it looks like it follows suit.  Smells of orange peel, maybe some light cinnamon and ginger if you're looking for it, some grains and hops. Pretty mellow on the aromatic side of things, but the aroma is there, which is nice. I was expecting more of the spices to come through, but for what it is, it smells nice.  On the first taste the malt comes in, but it doesn't have a very strong bite to it. Very mellow and doesn't last long. Then the spices come through pretty quick, but I picked up more orange peel than anything else. Good amount of spice. I didn't really taste as much cinnamon and ginger as I was hoping for. Don't take me wrong; I wasn't looking for it to be over spiced, nor did I want it to be. The spies are there though. There is a slight warming effect from tha alcohol, which complements the experience well.  This beer is pretty easy to drink even though it has an ABV of 5.8%. You could get by with drinking two or three if you could handle the effects of the alcohol, but hey're easy to drink.  Notes: A decent winter warmer that leaves you expecting more. The best way to describe this beer is ""mild and spicy.""",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

The smell was a bit muted but was pleasing with a fresh wheat smell. It tastes very good with a lot of intermingling, but balanced flavors. There is strong wheat, a bit of noble hops and a few spices I can't quite identify. Ginger? The beer featured a very pleasing and creamy mouthfeel.

Caramel, cinnamon, hell maybe some chocolates, and a great hop bitterness. A very balanced beer, with a nice kick in the pants from the -OH. Nice dry finish as per the hops.

The frothy, light tan head recedes rather quickly and leaves some spotty lace behind.  Primarily there is sweet crystal malt in the nose along with a nice sprinkle of wintry spice (cinnamon, nutmeg). A faint fruit character is present as well as a decent dose of hops. Some light toffee and sweet caramel round out a very nice smelling brew.  Bright and sweet with tons of caramel malt and some nutty toffee. More hops than the nose implies but still not enough to quite balance out the dominant maltiness. Some more light citrus fruit and plenty more spice in the finish. Festive and tasty.  Crisp and clean with a moderate body and mostly slick texture. Higher in carbonation but about average for the style. Primarily malty but still nicely balanced and slightly dry in the finish. A well rounded and very suitable winter brew.

Well balanced.  Mouthfeel- Smooth with little aftertaste in comparison with other winter beers.  Drinkability- Highly drinkable beer for those cold winter months.

Taste- Nice, semi-complex malt sweetness with some carmalized sugar. As it slides towards the back of your mouth, you get a very nice bittering hop dryness. It's hard to explain.

The spices give it a discernible, but pleasant bite. In addition to the spice, there is a sweetness on finishing a sip.  M - Smooth with light carbonation. Not a dry beer.

The malts and spices are there, but they don't seem 'robust' so much as 'a bit aggresive.' Maybe a bit thicker mouthfeel would have helped. Carbonation was medium and nice.

35,101,chiefydawg,3.9,"Poured this fresh offering from my own keggerator; and although it doesn't seem as flavorful as last years seasonal batch, I'm quite pleased again. For what it lost in spiciness and sweetness, it gained some ""sessionability"".  Dark amber with ample carbonation. The head starts out strong and fades quite a bit by mid-glass, but the lace clings to the sides nicely throughout.  My nose is a bit runny, so not catching all I should. Malty with some spice like a faint nutmeg/coriander. Fresh smelling even without a noticeable hop scent.  Not as strong a taste as last winter or so it seems. But really enough for most company (or too much for some) to enjoy over the holidays. The taste coincides with the smell as stated above, but is stronger and more enjoyable. A little more hop would have balanced it nicely; but hey, it's the style and I know this when I get it. I also thought that as a bock it would taste more alcoholic at the end, but it is well hidden.  Overall, I found this to be strong enough to hold up to most holiday fare, but light enough to sit around and sip a few without getting the heavy ""oh, did I really need that last glass?"" feeling that night or the morning after.

The cinnamon, orange peel, and other ""winter spices"" promised by the bottle are rather muted on this front.  The flavor itself is a mix of light honey; a crisp, hoppy finish, and a slightly watery, spritzy mouthfeel. The best aspect of this beer is how it seems to mix quaffability and heaviness. Again, the spices don't really play out here, and the overall impression is of a hearty ESB (like New Belgium's 2 Below on steroids). Sam Adams describes this as a ""dark wheat lager;"" perhaps I'm just missing the wheat, but the mouthfeel-- though with good heft and length--doesn't have the softness that I'd expect from wheat.

35,101,Greggy,3.57,"Presentation: Standard Sam Adams brown pry off bottle. The enjoy before date is clearly notched next to the UPC tag. A nice addition is the tag on the back explaining how this has, ""the most aromatic cinnamon."" More on that later...  Appearance: This beer pours a nice dark amber color. Pouring into my glass I was given about 3/4"" head that receded rather quickly. A thin lace remained, however.  Smell: At the first sniff, I was a little bit let down. I guess I was expecting a more defined and obvious array on the nose. What was evident was some caramel malts and some medium alcohol notes. As noted previously, Sad Adams states they have the most aromatic cinnamon but I had trouble really picking it up with a sniff; however, when I got to close and took in a nose full of head post-pour, I was hit in the face with a gram cracker note. It was aromatic, but unless you're snorting the beer, it's hard to pick up in large amounts.  Taste: This, despite being a little 1 dimensional to me, is a tasty treat during times in the winter when I just can't stomach a light ale or lager. It's not extremely dark, or light, it's just in the middle which sits just right with me. I would have liked to see a bit more carbonation in the mouth feel department and also a touch less alcohol on the palate. The aftertaste has a bit of gram cracker and isn't overly smooth, but I find that great in the winter.  Notes: I bought this in a six pack. I don't think I would buy it more than once a winter because I just am not to into it. It's a good beer, but just not something I will run out to buy.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,BeerManDan,3.21,"Had a large glass of the bock on tap and couldn't tell the difference between tap or the bottle. The color was a medium dark brown with very little tan foam. The smell was a little weak on the roasted malts and hops. Also, the taste was about the same as the aroma. A little weak and lack luster. Not a lot to write home about, just a average beer that had nothing special to write home about. Couldn't pick out anything of interest, just another average ale.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Procrastinator,3.68,"12 oz. brown bottle poured into Sam Adams pint glass, seems appropriate. Best before April notched on the label. This bottle is the final from a sixer recently purchased. I've been drinking this beer seasonally for many years and this is my first review of it.  Appearance: ruby reddish brown with creamy beige colored head which recedes to form a sticky layer on top of my beer. Very clean and refreshing looking with carbonation bubbling to the surface.  Smell: nutty, caramel maltiness and sweet plums with citrusy hop scents in the distance.  Taste: definite grain huskiness, caramel sweetness, hop bitterness and mild alcohol. Spices are very subtle, if noticeable at all.  Mouthfeel: dry upfront, buttery, almost medium bodied beer with excellent carbonation. Very nicely balanced.  Drinkability: straight forward easy drinking beer. Would have enjoyed more body and maybe a little more of the wheat taste. Always look for this one when the cooler months pass by.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Light spiciness - nutmeg or cinnamon or something. Finishes with light hops. Nice.  Mouthfeel - Light. Well-carbonated.  Drinkability - Doesn't appear to completely match up with the style.

The head was white and the lace went all the way to the bottom of the glass.  Smell- There is not really a strong scent to this lager tones of faint caramel malts and hops.  Taste- I found it to be pretty bland. Some spices, a little fruity, followed by a little bitter sweet taste.  Mouthfeel- Average with some carbonation bite.

Some yeast and slight hoppy mellowness. Taste is raisin and caramel with just a hint of hop bitterness. Really sweet and pretty good. Would be a great session beer.

I don't really know what to make of winter lagers except that they are clean with a metallic twinge and are expensive, which doesn't add up to me. Little aftertaste, the beer is gone shortly after it's swallowed. I'd probably drink this as my #2 beer of the night after something stronger to sort of reawaken my senses with something strong enough to clean my palette but clean enough not to leave a lingering, heavy impression.

Taste- An incredibly smooth taste, well balanced from beginning to end. Start with bread notes up front with a hint of roast nuts that transitions to an end of barley and pleasant tingly carbonation.  Mouthfeel- Got some hints of chomp to it, overall fills the palate decently.

T- More malt character with spicing and moderate hops to even the flavors. Not very robust.  M- Medium feel with moderate carbonation.  D- A fairly easy drinker.  Overall- It's a solid beer.

35,101,stewart124,3.45,Pours amber color with fizzy white head that didn't seem to last too long. Clean almost grassy smell with a malty nose.  Taste is sweet with a blend of caramel malts present. This leaves a nice tasty note of plums and raisins. Hops lean towards the noble variety and leave a nice clean taste that accentuates the malts without taking away from the bock. Finishes fairly dry with a residual sweetness and a soothing feeling on the tongue. The bottle mentions wheat and spices used in this but I find the spices subtle. I'm wondering if they used torrified wheat or malted wheat. The body is medium to a bit large so maybe torrified wheat adds to the body. Just my guess and take on this winter lager.  This is a winter beer that I look forward to every year and it brings back fond memories of first snows and a good beer shared with good friends.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

S- This beer has a smooth caramel smell with a light graham cracker note with a very light sweetness. There is a soft warmth that might be cinnamon in the finish.  T- This beer has a nice caramel sweetness that is smooth with a light toffee note to it. There is a nice cinnamon hint that is very mellow and lingers in the background. There is a nice dry crisp taste in the finish.  M- This beer has a medium mouthfeel with a nice tight fizz in the finish.

The taste of malt is thin and not apparent, but has a pumpkin like characteristic. Little body for a 5.8%. The hop bitterness is well balanced for its style.  Sure its drinkable. It is also quite pedestrian. More was expected out of this beer, but didn't quite materialized. This beer is not a bock, but more like a watered down spiced pumpkin drink.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

It hinted at being no better than the average cheap six pack. From here, it gets much better. As I mentioned, the taste, on top of the typical lager style, are appealing. The beer feels nice on the palate, the alcohol is not overwhelming, and certainly an appropriate winter brew.  Certainly not top shelf, but a noble effort from Sam Adams. Not a bad pick-up.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,tigerdoc,3.97,"A classic winter beer, and one of my favorite Sam Adams, probably second on my list behind the Boston Lager. The appearance is the weak point of the beer, the color is a nice amber color but the head was small and quickly diminishing. The aroma is malt sweetness balanced with Christmas spices and a little bit of toastyness. There is also a slight background of hops and fruity esters. The spices come out more pronounced in the flavor balanced with sweet toasty malt.

I do detect a slight metallic flavor that I didn't really enjoy.  Overall this is a solid yet forgettable bock.

I wonder if the shape of the specialty glass is behind this apparent anomaly? As the head fades a spotty lacing is left behind for a few drinks. Aromatically there is a very faint hint of spice that precedes some malty goodness. Tastes of sugar, syrup and sweet malts that are perfectly balanced by the hops. Mouthfeel is nice and light bodied yet fulfilling. This is a highly drinkable and tasty beverage that leaves me gratified.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,keaston,4.08,"Had this on tap at a burger joint. I just turned 21 so the prospect of ordering a beer at a restaurant is still pretty cool.  On to the beer:  A: Nice dark copper hue with good clarity. Looked tasty from the start.  S: Very subdued, mostly malt and water. Smelled almost like bread baking next to a mountain spring.  T: I had not had this beer before and knew almost nothing of it. I was expecting something a little more hoppy, like a regular Sam Adams, but what I got was a pleasant surprise. This beer is a big, beefy, chewy bock through and through. Malt, Malt and more malt with just enough hops to quell any cloying sweetness; right up my alley.  M: Smooth, and refreshing. Finished clean  D: This beer would have gotten a 5 for drinkability because it's tasty, easy and refreshing. The one drawback(?) is the 5.8 ABV witch excludes this from session beer status. Bottom line is this beer would be wonderful 2-3 times around, especially if the weather outside is frightful, but any more than that and you might start losing the ability to respect this particular brew.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

35,101,AltBock,2.88,"12oz. bottle with almost the same label that every other Sam Adams bottle has. There are 2 two different things on the label. They are that the color of the label is light sky blue and the other is that there are snowflakes floating around the mighty Sam Adams. I was surprised to see that this bottle was actually notched on the side. It says it's best before March, but it doesn't give a year. I going to go out on a limb and say that it's 2008.  Appearance: When poured into a standard American pint glass, this Sam Adams is a cross between a dark amber and a dark mahagony brown color with a few traces of some yellow honey. The head of foam started off real nice, but that quickly changed by dissipating rapidly into a few foamy rings and a speck of lace here and there. I wish I could describe the color of the lace, but I can't. It wasn't tan, but it wasn't white either. It did however look more white than tan, but it wasn't white either. I'm lost for words on the color of the head of foam.  Smell: It had a decent but faint aroma of roasted wheat, pretzel dough, sugar coated chestnuts, and a pinch of nutmeg to round off on what I guess was suppose to remind me of winter or Christmas. I thought there were going to be more spices in this beer, but the only thing to emerge was the slightest hint of nutmeg at the end.  Taste: While drinking this beer, I read on the neck label that this beer is a ""rich and hearty dark lager."" I saw that it was a dark lager, but I failed to see the rich and hearty. It was rich, but rich in the taste of dark roasted wheat. I don't think that's what they meant in ""rich."" The taste started off with no other than the no so wonderful taste of dark roasted wheat. After the roasted wheat had past, some sweet caramel, a pinch of nutmeg, and a sugar plum took its place. Just when I thought the roasted wheat was gone from the taste, it came back at the end.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel was a bit on the thin side with a miniature aftertaste of roasted wheat (again), and a sugar plum or two. This beer just loved roasted wheat. It's too bad the roasted wheat wasn't top notch or this beer would have been perfect.  Drinkability: To me it's another one of those Sam Adams beers that I couldn't care less about. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good either. It's too bad that I don't adore the taste of dark roasted wheat or I would have enjoyed it more.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,MillRat,3.4,"Had this at a friend's party. It was on ice, so I gave it a chance to warm up. Poured a yellow-orange with minimal head, despite a fairly active carbonation. The aroma is unremarkable, a little spice note, but hops are definitely out to lunch. There's a little bit of malt sweetness that's balance by a light spice presence. the spicing is done well, it doesn't hit you over the head with any particular clove, ginger, or other spices. I had a few bottles of Lakeshore Brewery's winter beer a few years back that got relegated to beer bread duty because the spices were so overwhelming. Not a problem here. Rather light-bodied, but not out of style for this lager. The light body and carbonation make this quite drinkable, and the spicing is subtle enough to be interesting as you try to tease out the various flavors.

Aroma is clean roasted malts with restrained christmas spices... lite orange, ginger and nutmeg+cinnamon.... Absolutely no yeast fruitiness.. I can't pick out any hops over the malts.  This is a very very clean lager.... extremely clean. The flavor lends itself completely to the lite roasted/chocolate malty side of things .... not overly sweet.. just malty. The spices are still there midpalate but really reveal on the finish. Certainly thin and overcarbonated for a bock ... but it still really hits the spot.  If I rated this one strictly on the ""bock"" guidelines, I would have drug it through the mud on body alone.... but the spices and the holiday season makes it more reasonable and acceptable.

Is this a bock, or another winter warmer? Hmm...  Mouthfeel is very full bodied and smooth, finishes a bit sticky sweet, but very smooth indeed.

35,101,jmalex,4.07,"I think this is the beer that got me drinking beer. I'll always have a special appreciation for it.  APPEARANCE: Pours a copper colored amber into a Sam Adams glass. It's crystal clear, and on top is a one-finger slightly darker than white head. It drops fairly quickly to a hearty collar and nearly a full covering of the surface.  SMELL: It's very rich and malty with some significant spiced accents. Nutmeg, allspice, and all the rest of the traditional winter spicings are there, but are definitely not overwhelming. A light roasty character comes out serving to balance the smell, as hop aroma is negligible. If anything, any hop aroma blends seamlessly with the spice, avoiding detection.  TASTE: The taste is fairly sweet with a mild toastiness and a more significant caramel quality. It definitely has that undeniable lager quality that I can't seem to place, and thankfully the flavors are pretty clean because of it. The spicing is less apparent in the flavor, perhaps owing to their melding with the rest of the flavors in this beer. Hop bitterness and flavor is very small and would only serve to balance the beer.  MOUTHFEEL: Slightly slick from a very caramelliness to it. The body is fairly full and carbonation is on the low end.  DRINKABILITY: Quite high, especially on a cold day. This is a well thought out seasonal, and is only held back by a slightly high sweetness.  I can see why I started drinking beer. I never really looked forward to winter except for when I'd start to see Winter Lager show up on tap handles at the bars.

35,101,Risser09,2.43,"12 oz bottle poured into a large snifter  Appearance: This beer pours a transparent brown and red color. The head rises to an inch in height and is an ivory color. The bubbles are all tiny and quickly fade away into the beer below.A tiny bit of lace holds on to the glass.  Smell: Malt aroma balanced by a hop bouquet. Rum and raisin are aromatic components. I don't get much wheat from this wheat beer. Spices include a bit of anise and licorice perhaps.  Taste: Pinchyness up front with a hop bite. Malt flavors are intertwined with a wheat flavor and body. Flavors are hops, wheat, nut bread, almond extract and vanilla. Most of these are weak though.  Mouthfeel: Ripe carbonation that hits early and faces into a medium bodied creaminess that most lagers possess. Alcohol isn't very noticable and neither is a sugary presence. Kind of lame in this category.  Drinkability: Decent, although I probably wouldn't refer to this beer in the winter.

Also, I pick up winter spices, caramel, and apples. The smell of hops is also around.  T- Honey, cinnamon, caramel, and brown sugar.  M- Thin and watery. Carb is mid to high.  D- Very high. This easy-to-drink beer is a great session brew!  Overall, I enjoyed this beer decently. It is not a stand out, nor is it something that I will try to seek out (not that it is hard) but if I went to a friends house and this was all he/she had, it would still be a good day!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,tpd975,3.63,"A: The body of this lager is brown and very clear. The head built quickly before dying down. Some lacing but nothing out of this world.  S: The malt here came out nicely, which is a welcome surprise from a macro/micro like Sam's. The spices cinnamon, allspice, and sharp clove where all noted and appreciated in a holiday brew.  T: Nice malty gem with hops in the finish. Subtle notes of maple, chocolate and cinnamon are in the middle. Nice tasting malty xmas brew.  M: Medium to thin with little carbonation. The body was a bit light in the ass for the big flavors in this beer.  D: Typical of a Sam's seasonal very drinkable but not the best of show.  Overall: Nice easy drinking brew that is pretty balance and tasty for a xmas offering. I will pick up a six pack to enjoy throughout the season.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,tommy78,3.85,"The Winter Lager's appearance was a deep, reddish colour with some head on top. The smell had a combination of spices and caramel in the beer. As for the taste, slight hoppiness with the spices converting over successful from the aroma. Light carbination best describes the mouthfeel of this beer. As for the drinkability, a couple of beers in one sitting would be the best approach. I did try this beer with pumpkin bread, and it surprised me how well these two complimented each other.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

35,101,JBogan,3.56,"Had this on tap. A darkish amber color with a nice creamy light tan head which stayed for quite a while and left good lacing.  At first I had a hard time picking out the aromas. As the beer warmed however I did detect it's malty character with some wheat bread and light spices.  Like the scent, it took a bit of time for the taste to show it's presence. Malty, a bit of caramel, spices.  Good mouthfeel. Smooth and creamy with just about the right amount of carbonation for a beer of this type.  Overall a good winter offering from Sam Adams. I enjoyed a few of these at a bar while watching a football game with friends and between the 6 of us this is all we drank the whole time, everybody was happy with it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,ccrida,3.69,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a nonic, the Winter Lager is a clear bronze with a medium sized, off-white head that quickly fades to a long lasting skim, leaving moderate lace.  Smell is sweet caramel and spicy, very bock.  Taste is rich sweetness, nice noel spices, with a lingering, sour tang from the wheat on the finish. Not to bad, although I recalled enjoying this more in years past.  Mouthfeel is carbonated and crisp, and the body's on the heavier side.  Drinkablity is average. Pretty satisfying full taste, but rather rich and heavy for the realtivly low ABV.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Smelled like a wheat beer...Tastes...  Good...Malty...Chocolatey...Cinnamony...  Aftertaste is elegant...stout...feels good going down...Was hard to pour in glass to see color as I kept dive bombing the bottle....I hope I got the mouthfeel down...it is excellent better than taste...can this be true?

35,101,Beerbuddha,3.5,Got this beer on tap at The Bulldog on Canal St. The appearance was a nice dark color with a thick off white head. The aroma was of toasted malts with hint of hops. The taste was the same as the smell. Great balance of malt and hops. The mouthfeel was medium body with medium carbonation. Overall drinkability was good. I enjoyed it.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,BiereBlanche,3.63,"12 oz. bottle from the Samuel Adam's Winter Pack. Also available in 6 packs.  Appearance - A nice redish-amber capped off with an off-white top, which settles disappointingly quickly, though it did leave a bit of lace clinging to the sides. Quite clear with signs of light carbonation  Smell - Slightly weak nose (I am sick, this might change on my next drink), I could pick out the toasty malt as it warmed. Hops are quite hard to detect, as fits for a bock. The nose is pleasant and clean, it could just be a bit more powerful...or I a bit less sick.  Taste - Smooth and clean taste. The toasted malt character comes through more in the taste than the smell, and is balanced out by a bittering that was all but absent in smell. Slight sweet aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - Medium mouthfeel, light on the carbonation. Quite smooth, as seems to fit Sam Adams offerings.  Drinkability - Very drinkable and a nice winter session beer. Very smooth and good flavor. The smell is weak, but it could be my fault for being sick.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,jhu1995,3.53,Pours a clear reddish color with a thick head and not much lacing. Smell is somewhat mild with some cinnamon and other spice aroma. Has a strong malt flavor that is balanced by the spices. Medium-bodied and smooth. An easy to drink beer. Overall a pretty decent brew.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,largadeer,3.89,"Appearance: Dark amber with great clarity. Pours with a 2-inch head that slowly settles to a crown. I really like the color of this beer.  Smell: The nose is disappointingly mild - it's bready and toasty with a hint of caramel, but it's very faint. Where's the hop aroma?  Taste: Tastes like Boston Lager's big brother. A hearty caramel malt backbone is nicely balanced with noble hops and spices (ginger and orange peel perhaps, maybe even a bit of cinnamon). The finish is clean and dry.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, smooth and warming. Slightly sticky on the palate.  Drinkability: An excellent winter session beer - it's hearty and warming but easy on the palate and remarkably smooth. Recommended and underrated.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,burnstar,3.98,Pours clear copper with a medium sized head. Aroma is sweet and spicy with some herbal hops. Taste is sweet with a lot of caramel at first. Then some bread and spiciness. Finishes with a touch of herbal hops and a lingering spiciness. Nice medium to full bodied mouthfeel. This is quite drinkable and a really solid and good winter seasonal.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,ZimZamZoom,4.1,"This is much better in the bottle in my opinion. I poured a 12 oz. into a pilsner glass, got a huge, tight tan head. Some good lacing as it fades. Beautiful light brown/amber color, clear as can be, nice carbonation. Really, watching the bubbles rise is a visual sensation.  Aroma of lightly roasted and caramel malts, some nice subtle hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. The spice is in the background here which I appreciate. Taste explodes with sweet malt, and the spice is a bit more upfront. Hops appear in the finish, but not for long.  Good body and a great mouthfeel in general. This is the last of the sixpack that I had and I'll be grabbing another soon for the Holidays. Recommended even as a bridge beer for BMC folks.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,littleshamrocks,3.83,"12 oz brown bottle with the enjoy before month clearly notched on the label. Served in a pint glass.  Pours a bright copper color with about one inch of creamy, tan head. The beer has a sparkling clarity and active carbonation. This is an extremely fresh offering and it looks awfully inviting. The head is mostly diminishing and left minimal lacing. Aromas are primarily clean with bready malts and spices. Flavor is dominated by the biscuity/bready malts, but I also picked up some cinnamon, salt, pepper, and some faint citrus at the end. Mouthfeel is medium+ bodied, with a decidedly dry texture and a tongue stinging, fizzy carbonation. Finishes pretty clean.  This is a fine example of the bock style. It has a prominent malt character, and a certain spiciness that seems to fall right in line with the season. The one possible drawback for me is the somewhat over carbonation. Other than that, this brew is very easy to consume and I would gladly have another.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,assmasterson,4.07,"Pours a deep brown, almost reddish color with a frothy head that is about half an inch thick.  The smell has hints of cinnamon, with a subtle hop background. The taste and mouthfeel is light-bodied with a certain sweetness up front which turns into a mild hop bitterness that does not linger, and afterwards a citrus snap follows.  Overall, a very nice winter brew that goes down easy that has some holiday-type undertones. Get it while you can.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,morimech,3.3,Pours a dark amber with minimal head. No lacing left behind. No activity at all in the beer shortly after the pour.  The aroma is rather weak. Sweet caramel malt and some spice but not much at all.  The taste is also a little weak. Sweet malt and mild cinnamon. It is easy drinking but rather unspectacular. I keep swirling and sipping the beer hoping something will pop. But now I am at the end of the second bottle and still nothing.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,jar2574,3.1,"Dark ruby color, biege head which is not as thick as I'd like. It smells of honey, hops & spices.  The taste is sweet upfront, with a malty aftertaste.

35,101,saintwarrick,3.73,"Always enjoy this brew from their Winter Seasonal pack, a definite highlight this time of year. This brew pours a very clear red with a thicker head than some bocks I have had in the past. Chocolate, caramel and some other sweet spices flow through the aroma of this brew.

35,101,Gambrinus1184,3.97,"Served at 3W & the Blue Bar, Litchfield, Conn.  A: Poured a rich, dark amber with a thin layer of foam which fled rather quickly, leaving me staring straight down through the brew.  S: Smells sweet, earthy and a little spicy.  T: Definitely sweet and malty, with very light hops. Doesn't scream ""winter,"" but it's toasty to some degree.  M: Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied and smooth. Clean hopping takes some of the sticky sweetness out of the malt.  D: A great session brew and one of Sam's better seasonal brews. Sometimes those Fezziwigs and porters get a little craxy around the holidays.  Overall, a pretty nice standard for the winter months, waiting for the White Ale to come out. It seems to stick around for too long, however, as does the Summer Ale. Not so much a complaint about the beer, which is solid, so much as SA's seasonal greed.

35,101,KCoemgen,3.66,I would agree with most of what has been said here about the Winter Lager. The only thing I would ad is that the flavours come out much more once the beer warmed up a little. I would recommend leaving this one out on the counter for about ten minutes before drinking.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,khiasmus,3.5,"A- A very clear amber with two fingers of creamy off-white head that settles to a ring and a thin layer in a matter of moments. Bubbles constantly, and the bubbles form little colonies on top of the beer.  S- Sweet, wonderful caramelly malt, a bit of (cascade?) hops to balance, and just a hint of spice... nutmeg? yummy.  T- Caramel malt, lots of grain flavor, a hint of maple, and a slight tinge of metal. A bit weak for a bock, but tasty nonetheless.  M- Smooth, medium-full, medium carbonation, but the finish is a bit dry and not particularly enjoyable.  D- Quite drinkable. I could have several of these in a night. It has just the right balance to make it a very easy-drinking lager, but also that extra flavor that makes it sooo much better than a typical macro lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,WaveRebel51,3.63,"Ugghh, another Nebraska winter. At least there's a nice selection of winter brews to pass the time.  Nice, deep dark reddish brown with slight lacing on the glass. Smell is ok: sweet and malty, with a hint of cinnamon and spices. Taste varied: my first bottle featured a nice, complex flavor of sweet malts, orange peel, cinnamon and nutmeg. But since that first bottle, all subsequent bottles have just been that sweet, bready malty taste similar to an Octoberfest, which is OK by me, because I like SA's O-fest. However, that first bottle with those different flavors was delicious.  All in all, nother nice SA seasonal offering.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

It has a rich malty aroma with hints of spices that I couldn't really make out in the aroma. The taste brought them out though. It has a really nice rich roasted malty taste with hints of hops and some cinnamon. It has a sweet aftertaste and really good mouthfeel. This is one excellent winter beer. I definately recommend it.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Smell - Decent malt odor with a hint of chocolate and cinnamon.  Taste - Well balanced malt flavor with chocolates and other spices coming through quite nicely.  Mouthfeel - Thick, satisfying texture with a clean finish and a very nice aftertaste leaving you wanting more.  Drinkability - One of the better Sam Adam's seasonals and a good choice for my first Bock (I've had Doubles, but my first single).

35,101,Durge,3.58,"A light/clear mahogany color with a thin fuzzy light tan head and good lace. The aroma is clean toffee but very thin, hard to detect the complexities that are to come in the flavor. The taste first announces raisin and nutmeg and more toffee malt. It's a little nutty and mildly carbonated. Fairly thin bodied, not unlike many bocks. Kind of winelike and even a bit grassy at moments. Pretty drinkable none-the-less. Definitely interesting, a fair amount going on and recommended for a taste. Not your average bock.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Gehrig,4.51,"One of my favorites from Sam Adams, Winter Lager is a very nice accompaniment to the onset of Winter, a good bock that can go with the season's hearty dinners or with dessert. A terrific amber color, Winter Lager pours a great head--really a beer with a terrific presentation. The taste brings out multiple flavors, with mild citrus, good spices such as ginger and cinnamon, and a strong malty flavor. It finishes well, and is easy to have a few of. An excellent creation from Sam Adams.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Gmann,3.75,"Pours a dark amber color with an off-white head that dissipated into a light cap. The smell is of wine grapes, has some woody characteristics. The taste is of brown bread malt, raisins, sweet with hints of caramel, a bit buttery. I don't pick up much in spiciness. The feel is moderate and very crisp, finishes smooth and balanced, though perhaps a touch on the sweet side.

35,101,Slatetank,3.64,"I had this on tap at Market Cross Pub and Brewery in Carlisle, Pa. Served cool in an Imperial pint glass. 3.5-3.5-3.5-3-3  A - A deep copper/caramel brown w/ a sliver of a light tan head. Sporadic lace is strewn as the lager is sipped.  S - A nutty woody malt aroma is dominant. A light caramel note is found in the bready aroma and a faint smell of spiced hops.  M - Medium, slick and fully carbonated w/ sweet malt and a clean finish. The effervescence is a bit aggressive for my taste. At least for the style, anyway.  T - There is a gentle caramel note w/ sweet and lactic malt flavors that are rather mild. The carbonation kind of overwhelms the chance to taste the malt and a light hop spice is barely detected. Pretty average flavors nowhere near the complexity of some other notables. Not as interesting as the Longshot or other seasonal products that SA has produced recently.  D - Barely passable, but may go well with greasy onion rings or cheddar skins to cut through. Just ok for me. It seems like it may be more drinkable when compared to the lineup at TGI Fridays.  had recently so decided to re review A-dark brown with haze and thick cream, smell is slight toasted grain with mild yeast ester and light spice/nuts. The feel is pretty light somewhat dry with moderately high carbonation Taste is good with moderately high malt impact with mellow toasted grain and mostly clean yeast flavor.

35,101,Jmamay22,3.36,"This dark wheat lager brewed with spices is best enjoyed by April.  The bock pours a dark amber with a voluminous very light colored amber, almost off white head. Solid head retention and some spotted lacing.  Has that classic Sam Adams scent. Hint of orange and very little spices. Mostly a malty sweeter smelling lager. Somewhat medicinal or metallic at times.  Tastes of hints of caramel and spiced hops. I imagine that this is intended to be a sweeter spiced beer, but the spices are lacking. Often the problem with winter brews is too much spice, but here they are lacking. Unfortunately this lacks anything notable in smell or taste.  This said the mouthfeel and caramel notes are enjoyable. Very drinkable winter brew. Typically I look for heartier winter brews, but while not necessarily bad this is just okay.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,BDIMike,4.2,Sam Adams Winter Lager is a nice American take on a German bock. The color is a perfect amber with just the right amount of head. The smell is much like a nice double bock from Germany. The taste is full taste with a lingering spiciness which is very nice. The mouthfeel is strong and thick.

Lovely pallet though. A Light caramel followed by vanilla, cinnamon flavor and spice is present the whole way through. A complementary hop kick on the end. Very good.  Medium body, you'd probably feel a bit full after a session. But the flavor is habit forming.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,AustinBeerLvr,4.6,"Poured a 12 ounce bottle with a clearly marked freshness date into a pint style glass.  This beer still has the same great blend of nice sweet, somewhat chewy malt with a great, not overly done winter spices. However, I swear the mouthfeel of this beer has been toned down significantly since a few years ago when I first tried it. Still good and very highly drinkable, just a bit thin for the style.  That being said, as this beer warms, it seems to get a much fuller mouthfeel, and best of all, this brew is very sessionable, as the BBC does not overdo the spices and the mouthfeel is actually good a for a session winter brew.  ***New note on the following day of trying this...I took the bottle out of the fridge and let it sit a full 15 minutes prior to pouring it. This beer is a good lesson to me in not drinking a beer too cold, especially a bock. The mouthfeel is actually good, the awesome warming taste comes through more, and this is just an all around awesome winter session beer assuming it's served at the right temperature.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

35,101,MICAMD,3.98,"A- A pretty dark coppery beer with some good streams of rising carbonation. It is perfectly clear, with a great head that lasts for quite some time. The lacing is excellent as well as the retention of the thin layer of head.  S- Very clean smelling with just a delicate touch of spicing. Very light, but very agreeable.  T- Pretty damn tasty. The malt is very carmely and crisp. The spicing is excellent and much more noticeable here than in the flavor. Nothing over the top, just a lot of subtleties.  M- The carbonation level is great. This is almost a little creamy- which goes perfectly with the flavor.  D- I was really impressed with this. This is the perfect winter beer to just have around. Didn't blow my socks off, but I am going to keep this around for sure.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Realale,4.08,"Clear light mahogany. Extremely fine beige head settles stickily to a complete cap that leaves nice lacing. This is a beautiful beer.  Nose is light caramel malt with good depth to it, ably supported by herbal hop notes. Tiniest hint of orange zest.  Good load of malt leads the palate. Some caramelly richness, but this stays quite light on its feet. Nice balancing bitterness, and a long, well-balanced finish.  Mouthfeel is quite nice. Again, it seems lighter than most bock interpretations, but that's fine with me. Very, even dangerously, drinkable.  Apart from a hint of orange, I've never picked up any spicing in this beer. Ditto the impact of the wheat in the grist - if I hadn't read it on the label, I'd never have guessed it. All that being said, the end result is a delicious beer that I drink ton of during the winter. 12 oz. bottle - best before April, 2008.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,InsolublePancake,2.97,"A- Decent orange-amber color, but lacking much of a head. Less than a half inch of head forms and fades quickly into a small ring of lace.  S- Nice malty aroma with notes of caramel and vanilla. The smell is also a little spicy (from the ""winter spices,"" perhaps?) but I can't really pick out anything specific. Maybe some cinnamon.  T- Rather nondescript malt flavor; a touch of breadiness I suppose. Some spices are certainly evident, but again, I can't really pick up anything specific. There's a touch of bitterness on the finish, along with an almost soap-like flavor. Kind of strange, and pretty bland.  M- Very thin, much more so than I was expecting. Not a whole lot in the way of carbonation.  D- Decent, I suppose. It's pretty light and bland, so I'd have no trouble polishing off a couple. The alcohol is a little high, but not too bad for the style.  I was pretty disappointed in this one. I seem to remember this being a lot better the first time I had it a couple years ago. Now it's just bland. I don't really see the point in buying it. I say give it a pass.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,jeonseh,3.17,copper colored without any really head from the pour and the little bit that was there disappeared pretty quickly. good taste though; can taste hints of cinnamon and a few other spices within when it first hits the mouth yet it has hints of bitterness mixed with a bit of caramely smoothness at the end but not sharp and on the whole enjoyable. can smell a bit of the spice and even some malt coming through it well. easy to drink and pretty enjoyable on the whole. just wondering why i was able to buy it already seeing that November has just come around but hey not going to complain.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Brad007,3.85,Pours a brown color with a one finger head. Aroma is light and malty with some spiciness. Very smooth as well.

35,101,AlbertiusMaximus,3.75,"12oz bottle poured into an ""official"" Sam Adams Boston Lager glass.  A: Dark amber/chestnut brown color with an off-white head.  S: Molasses, malt, burnt sugar/toffee with very, very subtle spices.  T: Medium-light mouthfeel, substantial for a lager. Very mild cinnamon taste at the end but roasted malt sweetness dominates in my opinion.  Overall this is a drinkable beer with good flavor seasonal appeal but less complexity and boldness than I had hoped for. Good entry beer for people investigating winter brews.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,CortexBomb,3.23,"Pour is nut brown with a light white head on top. I get a touch of spice on the nose, but not a lot there.  Taste starts out with a gentle caramel tone with a light fruit edge on it...malty tones take over about midway, biscuits. The cinnamon waits until late to show up, but it contributes without overpowering. Not an overstated beer for the style, but decent.  The mouth on this is ok, it's not overly thick, but it's serviceable. The drinkability, again about average.  The bottom line: This beer is nothing overly spectacular, but you can do much worse. The spice tones in this beer are, if anything, understated, so it might be a good beer for people who aren't into the spicier winter warmer style. This isn't bad though, crisp, relatively easy drinking. A winter Oktoberfest if anything.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

T - Malt with cinnamon and nutmeg. Slight roast character from malt. Hops are minimal if detectable at all. The roast character increases somewhat in the finish.  M - Heavy, slightly syrupy body with moderate carbonation.  D - Despite the somewhat heavy mouthfeel this beer is reasonably drinkable.

S: Smells of caramel malt, and a bit of spice, nutmeg, predominately.  T: Very malty, sweet, with lots of caramel and toffee. Spice is definitely there, hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. As the beer warms a distinct gingerbread flavour takes over, with a slight hint of alcohol.  M: Smooth, medium-bodied, solid carbonation adds robustness and body to the brew, very nice.  D: A good brew from Sam Adams, would have like more spice character to really bring on a Christmasy/Winter feel. Easy to drink, would buy again, one of the first winter brews I have seen this season, cool looking bottle.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,phisig137,3.51,"A- deep copper color, with a one finger head. Decent retention, and a pretty fair amount of lace. Tiny bubbles constantly rise from the bottom of the glass.  S- Caramel sweetness, raw grains, bready yeast, and some type of stale indistinguishable spice.  F- Mild grainy sweetness, with a surprising amount of toastiness. Not much else going on here. Slightly spicy finish, but I still can't pick it out. It initially tastes like clove, but quickly switches to something else that you'd never think of... like cardamom. Interesting. Fairly thin flavor though.  M- smooth and refined, medium to light bodied  D- Very good. Quite easy to suck these down without realizing it.  Overall, a little disappointed here. It's not bad in any way, but it just a little ""pedestrian"". I seem to remember this being a bit better last year. I don't blame Boston Beer though....

It has a nice scent, very sweet with hints of spices. Goes down smoothly, it would not be hard to drink more than one in a single setting. Excellent taste, a nice blend of malt (very sweet initial taste) and hops (slightly bitter, still slightly sweet) aftertaste.

A deep off white colored head with an average amount of lacing.  S: Sweet malty smell with the hint of a spice. Far from overpowering, but nice nonetheless.  T: Fruity, sweet, malty flavor on the initial taste with some caramel and a hint of chocolate after which the winter spices, cinnamon maybe, come through on the mid taste to finish. Slight hops are present.  M: Good mouthfeel but not a whole lot of alcohol in the mouth. It does provide a nice little warming taste with the spices they add.  D: Very good, this is an easy drinking beer that is far from heavy even though it is meant for the winter. You can easily sit and have a bunch of these and enjoy them.

I did manage to detect a hint of orange peel as well.  hoppier than i expected and the light carmel malt backbone was weaker than what i was expecting on the inital swig.

The beer poured a nice amber redish brown and the head was very think for a samueal adams. There was also a good amount of lacing. The smell was that of a slight sweet malt, with a slight hint of spice. The aroma was not very strong at all.  The taste was very good, a warm malty taste with a slight spice and bitterness. There may have also beer a small amount of hops at the end.. nice. The mouthfeel was good, with the CO2 being good and the beer being a lot thicker that I has expected. Surprisingly smooth.

35,101,Grundle20,3.77,"Appearance: From a high direct pour the beer produces an eggshell white minimal head which shows poor staying power and minimal lacing. The color is a deep copper with tangerine hues when held to light. The beer is crystal clear with a little bit of wispy carbonation.  Smell: The scent is kind of stout like or porter like with notes of cocoa powder and vanilla. The smell isn't overly potent but it's smooth and warming and seems to serve the beer well.  Taste and Mouthfeel: Being built on a medium caramel malt body seems to work well with this brews underlying notes of cocoa. The beer drinks relatively flat with just a little bit fizz toward the back of the drink. The finish is a little bit potent and after a few of these your mouth would most likely taste like malted cocoa.  Drinkability: This beer goes down really easy which is nice for a darker style. The only detractor here is that the finish isn't as clean as I tend to like, but decent none the less.  Bottom Line: I think this tastes more like a vienna lager than a bock but who really gives a shit anyways. This is a pretty decent beer and should be a Godsend to folks without good beer distribution in their area.

That's when reality set in.  Brown & hollow, with just enough head to keep it from being monotone. No movement. A sharp, peculiar fruity funk mixed with a crusty butter pecan sampling.  Taste was much of the same, with alot of the funk still attached. Almost headache driven. I didn't quite get it then, but while snacking later that night I did. A can of tangerine slices in light syrup; Del Monte; exactly. Maybe the beer wasn't all that fresh. Barely any bubbles. We are into the white ale season after all. It had just enough bite to drive everything down & get me warmed up.  I did drink it, so it wasn't anything near bad. Pretty light, but a syrup texture that wasn't totally pleasant. Buy me another somewhere else & I'll try it, but maybe this one has just been sitting a bit too long.  Last year's recipe out of the bottle was enjoyed a lot more.

35,101,BigRedN,3.53,"2007 - This beer seems to have changed since my original review. This review is for 2 bottles that were part of a mixed 12 pack I purchased in Jan '07.  Appearance: Poured from the 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, The beer is a dark amber to near brown. A thin off white head forms tha slowly fades to a cover on the liquid with some patchy lacing.  Smell: Some good malty aromas. Roasted malts, with an aroma of chocolate with a hint of coffee and caramel. I don;t really notice any spice or hops in the smell.  Taste: As I right this review I notice that this is classed as a bock. I think that is falls into that category. A nice soft roasted malts (bitter chocolate mostly). A touch of bitterness on the finish.  Mouthfeel: Light to medium in body with good carbonation.  Drinkability: Much better than the last time I had this (or at least remember.

Volumous tan head is excellent produceing alot of good laceing. The still clear amber-orange hued beer has lower caronation.  The nose is also very good. Floral hops mixed with spice dominate but a sharp alcohol accents and a faint maltiness mellows the overall aroma. The spices B.B.C. uses in this beer are very good and balanced perfectly with the flavours of the traditional ingredients. The hoppy nose is nice on this beer as is expected from B.B.C. with their love of hops. The taste is more on the malty side being true to style, which I feel B.B.C. usually does. There is a nice hop spice and bitterness at the begining and end respectivly. The malt is strangly not very wheaty but slightly toasty.  The mouthfeel is not impressive but fits well with the taste.

Not bad when you need to pound a few in the winter.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,jwc215,3.88,"Pours dark amber with a nice head that slowly descends to a thin cover. Some lacing sticks to glass.  The smell is of sweet grainy malt with a touch of caramel and mild winter spices.  The taste is of sweet malt. Caramel, a hint of winter spices, and mild earthy hops to balance out sweetness while keeping sweet character. Subtle peppery alcohol comes through. A slight metallic tinge is present, but doesn't interfere much.  Medium to full - Smooth with slight warming alcohol kick. Coating.  This is one, IMO - that tastes better on a nice tap than on a bottle. It's not a great winter, but good one and a good selection for a wintery brew on tap that is easy to drink, esp. for style.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Phocion,3.53,"Poured a transparent light amber color into a Sam Adams tulip. About a finger of frothy white head that had surprisingly good retention and left thick lacing all around the walls of the glass.  Nose was rich and malty. Roasted malts with a hint of delicate spices and wheat, with somewhat of a chocolatey undertone. Very little hops aroma.  Burnt malts predominate, with chocolate and caramel backing it up. Slightly spicier than the smell, with mostly cinnamon and clove coming out. Dry earthy wheat finish and just a subtle hint of herbal hops.  Moderately carbonated, and very smooth. Warm enough for sitting out on the patio on a 30 degree January night in California, but light enough to make a fairly decent session brew. As with most Sam Adams seasonals, I'd have to say it's nothing spectacular, but probably one of the better draft beers at most bars.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,FLAbeergutinMASS,4,"Nice beer from the Boston Brewing Company. If you're looking for a nice winter brew, sans the cloves and spices this is it. Nice sharp finished, preceded by a tangy fruit body and a well-balanced dose of malts.  Suffers a little due to the in my estimation, Sam Adams' undoing, of a slightly stale aura. Sometimes quality control can't control production. Not much in its sprit, a bit dull at times.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,NEhophead,3.67,"12 fl oz brown bottle, served in a pilsener glass. Purchase before 02.2007.  Thin amber with flaxen highlights. Half-inch of foamy, white head that settles to an intact sheet. Spotted lacing that has trouble holding.  Sweet molasses and rich, toffee aromas. Toasted malt character, filled with mustiness and stiff, malted wheat. Hints of creamy, milk chocolate.  Toasted malt character; airy, biscuit flavor with hints of buttery diacetyl. Sweet caramel and molasses initially, that blend into the breadiness and leaves the sweetness behind. A burst of carbonation is followed by a mild bitterness and an aftertaste of wheat and grain.  Medium bodied; smooth, almost creamy. Slightly thin in some spots for the style, but still smooth.  Not a bad Bock, but Boston Beer Co. didn't take a lot of chances in terms of flavor in this rendition. This offering seems rather static and subtle compared to its German counterparts.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Liquids,3.83,"Pours a pale amber with a cream colored head that holds like cappucino foam in this pint glass...a surprise. Aroma is very Sam, hops are sweet with the aroma of unconverted caramel malt sugars, and that familiar aroma of a wheat-tinged doppelbock, but cleaner, less earthy and less intense than a doppel all around. This is my first plain old ""bock"" so doppels are what I'm comparing it to. Taste is again very Sam, but with a sweeter husky backbone than the standard Boston lager. Im drinking this too cold (my buddy had this in the fridge unlike the cellar temps I ususally drink at) for a fair comparisons, and it needs to warm up. Once it does, the wheat is more detectable, and it makes this a bit more rounded ain unique, though its not light years away in taste from other sam beers. Mouthfeel is medium, nothing startling here. On part and satisfactory. Overall its better than most beers I take a chance on, but not one I'll be crazy about buying, though one I'd pick over others in a generic tap list. Of note, there was a twelver of this at a small mixed gathering I went to, and I found many of the bottles left on the table half empty or nearly full, meaning many of the non-craft drinkers tried it and left it on the table, sadly. This makes my heart both sad and glad, as to a craft drinker some Sam brew can seem almost macro, until you put it next to the thirty pack of coors light at a celebration and realize, it really isn't even close to being tasteless, non-threatening swill.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

35,101,cooncat,3.41,"Sample was a 12 oz. bottle, well within date.  A vigorous pour into a pint glass produced a medium creamy off white head, which was short lived. However, lacing (on a swirl of the glass) was evident to the bottom of the glass. The nose was very light ... not what I expected for a Winter Wheat Lager (Bock?). The bottle says ""brewed with Winter spices"", but that was not evident to me in the nose, nor in the taste. I got an impression of a light maltiness, but the Noble hops were what I picked up on the most, both in the nose and taste. Body is medium with a level of carbination which makes it refreshing and crisp. I can't honestly say that I tasted any ""Winter Spices"". The taste that I got was similar to a light Pale ale, if anything. So, I was left, very confused. Here is a beer touted as being a Winter Wheat Spiced Lager, and, to me, it didn't taste like a Wheat, nor did I detect spices. Its listed as a Bock, but lacks the usual sweetness of a Bock. Maybe they put the wrong label on this bottle?  Nevertheless, I enjoyed it as it was. I can't say it's true to its style or to what is on the label, but I can say that its a clean, refreshing beer that would likely make a good session beer.

Smells of sweet malts and not a lot else. The aroma is not very strong at all.  Taste is also that sweet malty flavor, along with some subtle spice and fruitiness and a very slight hop bittering in the finish.  Mouthfeel is crisp and dry, medium-bodied.  Drinkability is pretty good, the beer isn't really tasty enough to have a lot of, this is a safe beer for someone wanting to try craft beer without diving headfirst into the style.

35,101,dwarvenspirits,4,My wife ordered this beer while I was en-route to the restaurant. I wasn't sure what she ordered me and I started to drink it. It has a wonderful deep copper/amber hue to it. The head was small but it did retain a nice lacing. It smells more malty with a hint (maybe) of some kind of spice but I'm not sure. When I took a sip I knew it was a Sam Adams because it had the traditional Sam Adams Boston Lager taste to it (not sure if that makes sense). I was looking for more spiciness from this beer since it was a winter brew but I was surprised to find that it didn't have a huge spice profile. It was more on the malty side and I thought the body was a touch heavy. For a winter lager I found it to be a tasty beer. Nothing outstanding but tasty.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,casualbeerman,4.65,"This beer is pretty hard to distinguish from the flagship Boston Lager. The only difference I can see is that the head tends to be smaller and dissipate faster. That means the color is a nice healthy shade of copper. The smell is and dominated by the malts with the hops relatively subdued in the background. As is usually the case, the smell was indicative of the taste which was dominated by the malts with the hops more in the background. The malt character is similar to the regular Boston Lager. The taste is strong, fairly sweet, complex, but still very clean. The main difference I noticed is that the hops are more sublte. They are there and provide a nice balance, but there's less of that dry intrusive hoppy bitterness as compared to the non-seasonal Boston Lager. All in all this was an excellent beer and the subtler hops make this an easy choice for a session beer. Watch out for that increased alcohol content though.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,barefootbrewer,3.8,"This beer poured a pretty clear copper color. It doesnt have much head or lacing. The smell is sweet and caramel tones are noticeable.

Smell is of caramel, with no hint of hops at all, but still pretty pleasant.  Taste is a strong caramel malt taste with a fair amount of sweetness, but little in the way of hop character. Mouthfeel is also a bit thin, with high levels of carbonation and a bit of a watery character to it.  Still, this beer was easy to drink and clearly a beer for the masses, versus those looking for more ""challenging beers.""

35,101,basscram,3.24,"Poured from a bottle into my Kronenbourg half litre mug. Pours a reddish brown with nice one finger head and subsides in about 2 minutes. Smell is a very slight molasses as is the first taste. Its very lightly done and drinks so easily. No bite but just a soothing feel along the whole tongue, which accounts for its high drinkability. As soon as the taste hits your tongue it quickly subsides even if you move it around a bit, which... makes you wanna drink more. Also if you do other things with your nose and mouth it makes it taste like a slight pleasing smoky molasses.

35,101,JimFalzone,3.55,"Poured at 40 degrees into a pint glass. I have had these before, so no surprises this year. It's a rich, dark lager. It is fairly light compared to other winter beers. Not especially high in alcohol (5.8%) and not overly malty. There are some wintery spicey noted in the background. Perhaps a little citrusy? It's probably the mildest winter beer you will ever encounter. It's OK, but the sweetness gets a little tiring after you've put back one or two. I would prefer a heavy winter ale or a crisp golden lager, this hybrid style is not a favorite.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

I couldn't catch much in the nose - standard malt, maybe some baked bread with a touch of nutmeg.  Taste was excellent and well-balanced - like a beery gingerbread muffin. The aftertaste especially was quite redolent of gingerbread.  Mouthfeel was a little thin - I could go for this with a bit more heft.  Drinkability is through the roof.

Not getting the spices nor other attributes often associated with this beer.  Torn between sweetness and then dry with a hint of spice and orange. Hops linger in the background.  Maybe looking for more than what is there but still a very enjoyable brew.  Nice to sit and sip at the bar, kitchen table, next to a fire, just about anywhere.

Fortunately, the host is a BA (by definition though not by membership) and I knew he'd do something well in the beer dept. I was not disappointed. He handed me a Sam Adams Winter Lager and I knew it would be a great party. The label mentions spices, but if present, they were in the background in a supporting role because the smell and taste said malt first with touch of hops for balance. Yes, a little sweet, but not too sweet and ultimately very drinkable. Most of all, rich caramel malt taste with just the right carbonation to be extremely refreshing on a cold winter evening.

I gave it all 3.5's in the individual ratings, this time, compared to A-4.5 and then 4.0's on the other one.  Fairly nice bock.  A= deeper amber, modest head  S- nice, a bit fresh scented for a bock beer (hops?); very lager-typical scent overall.  T= chestnut-y, lightly nutty, a modestly interesting twist on a bock, lots of lager taste and flowery hops but not biting.  M= almost a minty-after-effect that actually opens my sinuses, oddly; some nutty flavor, light molasses-malty residues.  D= fine if you're into this taste at the moment.  === My review of 17 December 2006-  Appearance-- nice cabernet-amber with a yellow sudsy head. The head settled but a nice amount remained, fully covering the beer for quite some time. Profuse micro-bubbles rising throughout the stein during full consumption.  Smell-- not much evidence thereof at first, then very nice with floral hops, rich malt and some hints of fruitiness.  Taste-- nice full malt with some striking floral-hops notes. Possibly some hints of fruity taste ie plum or prune dodging elusively, as well as in the finish.  Mouthfeel-- pleasant, nothing detracting.

Taste: The taste shifts from an initial flavor of mostly malts, to some spices, and eventually some hops (with the malt flavor still strongly in the background).  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with mild carbonation. Goes down smooth.  Drinkability: The alcohol content is not bothersome at all, and the nice taste makes this go down quite well again and again...

I don't detect too much of a hops aroma, but a subtle copper fragrance, kind of like how a jar of pennies would smell.  The brew presents itself quite nicely. The head which emerges is a gentle tan color with good retention, and dissolves into lacing that lasts all the way through. The body is dark copper and quite clear.

The mouthfeel was light/medium with a medium carbonation. The drinkability was above average, but since it was a little bit sweeter than I prefer, I can't see myself drinking too many of them.

35,101,TheLongBeachBum,3.93,"Presentation: 12 ounce standard brown glass bottle with a shoulder embossed with a brace of Sam Adams text. Frosted dark blue, light blue and freezing white colored labeled projects the Winter perfectly. Listed as a Seasonal Brew. The label design on my bottle differs markedly from the older more expressive one in the BA Database. For this Winter Lager has a much simpler appearance, but one that looks more like the other SA generic labels. Described as A Dark Wheat Lager brewed with Winter Spices Has a nicked APR Brewery Fresh date and a listed Strength of 5.8% ABV.  Appearance: Dark coppered body with some darker amber beset in the ruby jeweled clarity. Beige head has tanned inflections and leaves some very accomplished looking lacing on the sides of the glass. Finely dissolved conditioning is high in spirits and reinstates a ½ thick head with a good swirl. Overall looks are impressive.  Nose: Musty caramel with some wheat laden but discernibly toasted malts. Bitterness lingers in and amongst a soft spiced middle. Finish is clean and attractive. Solid aromas but a tad lightweight strength wise at times.  Taste: Entrance has toasted malt, commences with caramel and wheat. Delicate spiced hoppiness wrestles with the malts, but breaks through here and there; just enough to tease, but it makes a clean get away in the dry ending. The entire brew is very clean, there are, essentially, no faults to this beer at all; minor niggles, but certainly no faults.  Mouthfeel: I had to crack my second bottle (from the SA Winter Classic Pack) to finish this review and on reflection it doesnt quite make a 4.0, but it is a very solid 3.5. Could be viewed as light, but the body is clean which coupled with its stripped down persona, and devoid of any excessive detritus, lends a more lightweight aspect.  Drinkability: Judging by the fact that I was on my second bottle by this part of the review, it seems that the issue of Drinkability wouldnt be too hard to address. This is nicely balanced brew, light spices, smooth but beefy Mouthfeel,  Overall: Cant believe that I missed the opportunity to Review this to date as this is one of my favorite Seasonal Brews from Sam Adams. It is always a pleasure to sink a couple more of these once I get cracked into my annual SA Winter Classics Pack.

Sweet, caramelly, a bit spicy, nice aftertaste, full, malty. It's impressive, especially at $7 per 6 pack. I would call this a doppelbock if I didn't know any better.

Very refreshing and slightly sweet taste, a quite enjoyable balance of spices and hops. I myself an a Guiness man and usually don't venture into the realm of ligher beers and ales, but this beer was a very common ground between the dark stouts I'm used to and the lighter type beers (think the Millers and Dud's of the world) except with much more flavor and body.

Unfortunately, the smell was not as strong as its appearance would lead you to believe but you could still make out the sweet aroma of malt and spices.

35,101,BBM,3.85,"This beer pours a clear copper-orange color with a nice white head atop it. The aroma is faint, of sweet malt and very light spices.  I'm a fan of this winter brew, even though it's not all that complex. There is a rich caramel malt character up front, balanced by a nice bitter hop finish. The spices don't really come through too strongly, although there are hints of nutmeg and cloves. Mouthfeel is fizzy, and a bit sticky. A very sessionable winter brew that goes very well with food.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,DrJay,3.13,"Clear, rich coppery colour. The pour produced little head, which left little lacing on the glass. Plain aroma with some malt and caramel. Low bitterness, again with some crackery malt and caramel sweetness. Mild spices kicked in towards the end. The body seemed heavier than it was due to a slight syrupy character that appeared after a few sips. Carbonation was a little on the higher side and it was a bit dry. A fairly average beer, nothing really wrong, quaffable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,neenerzig,3.83,"This beer pours a nice clear light to medium brown color with a head that doesn't stick around for long. It starts out quite nice but is all but gone 5 minutes after being poured. It does leave some nice lacing though. Aromas of malt, hops and spices are all present. Not much else though. A bit weak aroma wise. Flavors of sweet malt, hops, and a bit of spices are present perhaps with a bit of cinnamon and perhaps a bit of caramel or roasted brown sugar. Has a smooth, sort of crispy mouthfeel with light carbonation. It's easy to drink. This is not a bad brew by any means, but nothing super great either. Worth having at least once though.

35,101,Applesauce1,4.12,"I picked up the winter lager at the Pit Stop in Nelsonville, OH. The label says it will be fresh until April.  Appearance: amber-brown with a thin white head off the pour Smell: mild hoppiness, maybe a pine-like smell (some type of wood smell); those are the most dominant Taste: impressive; very balanced; theres a slight hoppiness in the aftertaste; some malty sweetness through most of the sip; a hint of spiciness too; almost like a steak seasoning spiciness (sounds kinda weird, but thats what im picking up here) Mouthfeel: medium bodied Drinkability: good; i wish i had another in my fridge for later",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

The aroma isn't strong at all, but what I can smell is some sweet malt, spices and a bit of hops. It tastes like spices (cinnamon, nutmeg), caramel and malt, with a little bit of hop bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium and smooth. The drinkability is OK. Overall the beer is good.

Smell is awfully mild I thought there would be more spice to it, oh well. Taste is pretty typical for a Sam Adams. This one is heavy on the malts, nice and sweet with just a touch of spice.

35,101,HoustonTX,4.1,"Bought a case of these today, after throughly enjoying last years offering.  Pours a ruby color with a solid fluffy head. The head is quite sticky, and leaves a good amount of lace. Carbonation is streaming, and exactly what I expect from a Winter Warmer. Now onto the smell. The smell has a nice maltiness to it. Earthy in nature, with that bread crust scentalation. Once again, spot on for the style. A strong dose of wheat and even more malt earthiness.  Now for the taste. Damn this beer tastes good after working 10 hours. Strong malt and wheat once again, just as the smell. Spices and hops are balanced and do not overwhelm the palate. It produces a snappy Winter Warming edge. Brown sugar and caramel are also present. Mouthfeel is right on for the style, and drinkability is excellent.  An incredible offering from Boston Brewing Company. This beer is definitely on the upper echelon of their beers, and one to keep an eye out for each coming winter.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

There is a slight hint of malt in aroma, not much else, but it smells like a bock. It has a sweet malt flavor that is characteristic of a bock beer with some subtle spiciness that is mostly noted on the finish. It has a medium body with moderate carbonation.  This is a decent bock with some spiciness. Overall, it's closer to a German-style 'winter' or 'Christmas' bier than an English style that typically highlight the spices more.

Very little carbination or activity can be seen in the beverage.  A slight touch of hops and malt that blends for a light smell of wet wood wafts off the beverage.  The Lager tastes of bitter hops. It is smooth and leaves a slight alcohol aftertaste, it is quite brisk on the palate.  A good brew that tastes strong.

Poured into a pint glass, the beer is a dark copper, almost brown shade. 1/4 inch head that quickly faded, leaving slight lacing on the glass. The aroma is weak, mainly the spices being detectable. The mouthfeel is just right for a lager. The taste to me, is like a weaker version of Sam Adams Old Fezziwig Ale. The spices arent as strong, and the beer not as thick, but still very enjoyable. Easily a session beer, and worth sharing with family and friends on the cold winter evenings.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,kernalklink,3.68,"This winter warmer poured dark amber with a copper head and generous lacing throughout. Th aromas were not impressive- somewhat sour malt with some spice. The taste saved the brew as the slight citrus peel and cinnamon flavors balanced well with the toasted malts and became refreshing. Good carbonation, no real hint of alcohol. A more distinct flavor combination would help, but the mild flavors add to its drinkability.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,jpkoch1962,3.66,"Poured a deep amber with light, thick tan head. Color was much like an Alt or Marzen. Head disappeared within minutes leaving a light lace. Spices, pepper, ginger and sweet caramel dominated the aroma. The front end began sweet (taffey), but a tart, acidic spiceiness took over. This lager had a subdued middle, and the finish fell to a dull sweetness. The body, however remained full. A bit of an aftertaste remained. I thought the strong tartness took the beer a bit out of balance.  This is a nice wheat lager. The rich body and spiceienss is a nice surprise. My only complaint is the balance, and how the beer finished. Took off for drinkability points accordingly.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

I purchased this in mid-November and the ""notch"" is on April 2007.  Appearance - Clear dark amber color, nice carbonation. Nothing really noteworthy. The carbonation is a healthy amount and providing a nice head. Not much of a lacing.  Smell - Nice roasted malt aroma. A faint spice, but nothing overly ""spicy"".  Taste - Nicely balanced. Lightly-flavored with a hint of something more. That ""something more"" would be a bit of cinnamon but nothing over-bearing. A nice ""warm"" feel to the beer that grows as the beer warms. Nice finish that isn't tainted with a hop bite.  Mouthfeel - Suprisingly this beer has a body to it. Nice feel with a slick finish that makes you remember that you just had a sip. I would see this as a good point, given the style.  Drinkability - This beer I would rank much higher than the Harpoon Winter Warmer. This is how a balanced warmer should be.

Mild spicing. Charred fruit. Smell is subdued and allows a hint of alcohol to creep through.  Very well balanced -- equal parts malts, hops, spices. Hops are crisp and spicy, malts are sweet and figgy, definitely a base of amber malts that reminds me of some Saranac products. Hops are present in the beginning, middle, and end. Miscellaneous sweet seasonings on the finish and a grains of paradise type taste lingers (and not in a welcome way).  Mouthfeel is medium thickness with heavy carbonation, combined with the hops and spices it packs a tingle on the tongue. Doesn't go down without a fight, but that's a good thing here.  Not so remarkable that I'd make this the focus of a tasting, but easily sessionable, and well balanced for a winter seasonal.

Slight fruity, slight earthy, and slight sweetness give a rounded impression for any cool weather session and a compliment to many wintry meals.  Sam Adams Winter Lager pours with a medium brown, light mohogany hue and with bright clarity. A creamy off-white head caps the beer and releases spotty pockets of lace as the beer falls. A firm, yet light Bock look.  Mild aromas of soft pilsner malt cracker character is layered with notes of grape, light toast, nuts, and almost chocolate. A light spicy character tickles the nose with seemingly peppercorn, lavender, and cinnamon.  Flavors fare similarly with a mostly malt, but partly grain flavor. Sugary malty sweetness is moderate and carries a slight candied fruit with toast, light chocolate, nuts, and spice. Earthy hops allow for a slight grassy taste in finish, just as the added spices blend into bitterness late.  Medium to start, but after the creamy carbonation subdues, the beer lingers in finish with a semi-dry feel with slight lingering sweetness, mild grain astringency, slight alcohol warmth, and largely clean for its style.  Perhaps a bit timid on all fronts, this is kind of a Bock with training wheels.

T: Begins fruity on the tip of the tongue; apple, strawberry and perhaps some raspberry. Moves to a subtle...and some what boring....caramel component with toasted barley. Finishes malty, sort of caramel apple like  M: Thin and frankly unfullfiling.  D: I've like this beer much more in the past. Do they change their recipe every year? Seems thin and flavorless compared to past years",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,dustylong,2.97,"Alright...I haven't reviewed for a few months...so here goes. Pours a dark copper color with moderate head and some lacing (poured from a bottle into a pint glass). The scent is not very strong, has a sweet aroma. Has a fairly malty taste, with a clean finish. Has a thicker mouthfeel to it. A decent beer, but nothing all that impressive. Worth trying over the holiday season.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,rebel1771,4.17,"Pours a dark amber color with a pretty decent head.  Sweet smelling caramel malts dominate the aroma along with a touch of cinnamon and maybe a little vanilla.  The flavor was way better than what I expected. The sweet caramel malts show back up, but not in an overpowering way some winter brews. The cinnamon is slight but notable and the vanilla really smooths this brew out.  This is one fine brew, I could down a few of these in one sitting easy.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,wedge,3.63,"Pours a clear chestnut brown - thin, soapy head sticks to the surface well. Light but solid aroma of bready malts, toasted caramel, and warm spiced citrus. Soft, rich malty flavor balanced with spices. Earthy, sweet maple and grain. As a weizenbock, which BBC labels it, the mouthfeel seems a little thin. Not bad though, soft and very smooth.  Very enjoyable brew all around. I wish it was a little beefier, but overall its not a bad rendition of a mellow lagered weizenbock.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,phishgator,3.46,"This is poured into a 22 oz Hefe weizen glass. Nice deep copper hue and a large foamy head. The head dissipates slowly, but never completely goes away. The aroma is only slight; there seems to be a hint of toasted malt, a touch of spices I can't place (nutmeg), and sugary molasses. The taste is malt dominated! There is the cinammon, the malt, and the malt. Very little hop presence. The body is a little thin. I would say that since I finished the 6 pack in two nights it's a very drinkable brew. A nice seasonal that I would say one should try.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,hunteraw,3.65,"On the whole, seems more like a doppelbock than a winter warmer.  Appearance: Beautiful garnet in color, moderate head, and little to no lacing. Points for such a nice color, though.  Smell: Very much like a doppelbock. Malty, lager-clean, with a hint of spice.  Taste: Caramel notes, some spice in the background. Doesn't taste as good as it smells. Very little in the way of hop character. Hard to pick out individual spices - restrained usage.  Mouthfeel: Good body for a lager, good carbonation.  Drinkability: Decent, but not exceptional.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Nose: On the fainter side - heavy on the malts combine w/ common lager hop aroma... notes of maple syrup, brown sugar, and a touch of cinnamon. Nothing too special.  Mouth: Strong mouth feel is the first noticeable attribute, heavily carbonated. Apple pie notes in the flavor, cinnamon plus tart flavors along the sides of the tongue. A dry finish leaves the back of the mouth asking ""when's it my turn??"" More character comes out as it warms - the presence of nutmeg makes itself known, but unfortunately as the temperature increases the sweetness up front increases but the back of the mouth gets filled with some grungy flavor that I don't like.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

I can only guess as to what other ""winter spices"" they used. Nutmeg? Is that even a winter spice? Also present is the familiar sensation of dark wheat malt, which I recognize from homebrewing.  Altogether this brew is malty, sweet and warming. If only it were colder out. Damn these Indian summers.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,cjgator3,3.38,"Pours a dark brownish copper color with a fizzy tan head that quickly dissapears.

35,101,cabsandking,3.98,"Deep amber color with a sticky tan head for some good lacing action. The nose offers some unexpected notes such as celery, pure honey, and malt characters. The taste is a mellow blend of smooth roasted malts, toffee, and ginger cookies in the background and finish. Later tastes reveal some wheat crackers, orange peel, and something similar to pumpkin. Medium body and a terrific mouthfeel that is smooth up front, creamy in the middle, and a pop of fizz at the end.

35,101,Metalmonk,4,"Pours a glassy sunburst-tinted amber, with a big head that reduces slowly, eventually ending up a skim across the top of that great color. Huge lace too. Just looking at it makes me warm.  Aroma brings mostly caramel to the nose, very malty with hints of vanilla. The spices that reveal themselves in the flavor are muted in the aroma, drowned in malt, but the aroma that is here is very nice.  The flavor brings more malt, bready and caramel-like, and the spices advertised on the 6-pack box (orange zest, cinnamon, ginger) are there, but very subtle. You pick them up better as the beer warms. Best drank after the chill is taken off a bit, so you can get those subtle flavors. And it kinda reminds of a pumpkin ale, with suggestions of coriander, allspice and nutmeg, with cirtusy sharpness in the finish.  Delicious and delicate, with intriguing subtleties, this is definitely the most impressive beer I've had from Samuel Adams' very long list of offerings.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

35,101,KyleVick4,3.96,"12 oz  A: Pours with a nice head that clings to the sides. An appealing color which is crystal clear. Looks very nice.  S: Sweet carmel malt is dominant (though not as dominant as in their oktoberfest) along with some spicyness of what I think is ginger. Kinda bland for being a spiced beer, but good nonetheless  T: A nice sweet taste of the carmel malts, expected that from the smell, the melding of the medium/high carbonation the mild spices and the spicyness contributed to the hops all are fabulous. A pretty tasty session beer for sure.  M: The carbonation is strange, but not in a bad way. When I drink it I think mmm low carbonation, then when I ""taste"" it I think hmmm a little high carbonation. I think I am getting the spices and carbonation mixed up a little, mainly bc they have been integrated so well together. Either way the body is fairly thick for a traditional lager and a touch chewy. However, I assume when it gets cold (read: I live in south florida) this quality is desirable. But the 75 degree weather out today may detract from the full mouthfeel, however I will not take off points due to this being the style.  D: A very drinkable beer, the low alcohol and easy taste/mouthfeel contribute to it, while the carmel malts and spices/hops give it a nice taste to go down also.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Some interesting spices happening here, like creamy vanilla and faint nutmeg. I can't pinpoint it, but hell yeah.  Taste was upfront moderate sweet caramel toasted malt and light cinnamon followed by a moderate tasty roasted graininess and sweet caramel and spiced candy on a somewhat lengthy mild earthy yeasty finish. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, silky and creamy, softly carbonated, with light astringency.  Overall, I wish I had a more extensive vocabulary.

Strong caramelized sugar smells similar to an Oktoberfest. Grainy malts in the background.  Light flavors all around, but still spicey and malty enough to have good complexity. The light-medium body and medium carbonation give it a little kick. Some sweeter flavors can be tasted throughout. Hop bitterness is at a minimum.

I find this beer to be a little dull and unexciting - kind of one dimensional. After one, I've had enough and find it's time to move on.

35,101,beerogre,4.1,"And so as the time approaches for the clocks to go back, as we begin our descent into the dark days of Winter, the arrival of Sam Adams Winter Lager on the supermarket shelves serves to remind us that it's not all doom and gloom, and that there are many enjoyable things to look forward to in the coming season, particularly if you enjoy craft beer.  The coming of the Winter Lager doesn't quite excite me as much as the arrival of the Octoberfest a couple of months earlier, which is ironic, as for me part of the appeal of the Octoberfest is that it hints at the Winter treasures to come, of which the Winter Lager is one.  But still, all things considered it's another smashing seasonal beer from Sam Adams, which keeps me going in between the season's more luxurious offerings like Old Jubiliation and Hibernation.  It's highly drinkable and as a result doesn't stay in the glass very long at all, so you'll be back at the fridge in no time, but a word to the wise, it's a bit of a cheeky monkey and will quickly creep up on you.  If they haven't got one already, the Boston Beer Co really should be presented with some sort of lifetime achievement award.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

The bottle label has changed over the years and currently its baby blue with large sam adams text. Poured into a tall pils glass it forms a large loose head that fades to a solid cover. Amber to red body. Large carbonation.  First reaction was it reminded me of freshly baked cherry pie. Plenty of spices to kick it up a bit. On the spicier side of things, although its really more of a combo of sharp carbonation, touch of spices and a quick hitting hop backer. Toasted malts come into the picture as a body enhancer.  Notes: I liked this offering. It's not an eye opening experience. More along the lines of a solid representation, nothing offensive, well made and highly drinkable. Well done.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,joe1510,3,"12oz. Bottle  Poured Sam Adam's Winter Lager into a pint glass. Poured a crystal clear amber. There was about a quarter inch head up top but it disappeared so quickly that I cant even tell you what color it was. All that's left is a couple of tiny bibbles swirling around. Small amount of carbonation bubbles coming from the bottom of the glass.  Smell is of sweet malt, wet cardboard, brown sugar, and there's even some dark cherries in there. The cardboard doesn't take away from the smell, it's faint, but it is there. There is also a little alcohol toward the end. No hops present.  Taste is a disappointment. I really dont get a whole lot of anything. The biggest flavor is solvent alcohol in the finish. Before the alcohol it's hard to pick up certain flavors cause they are weak and muddy. There's a touch of sweetness and that's followed by I don't know what. I can't pick out any flavors here...It's tasting better as it warms and I'm getting to the bottom of my glass. There is some sugary sweet dark fruits and toasted malts. The alcohol isn't as evident either. Strange but true. I'd reccomend letting this one sit out awhile before drinking.  Mouthfeel is average. Medium bodied. Coating.  I gave the drinkability as high as I did because for some reason it reminds me of a macro. Not much flavor but easy going down.  I hate to have to give such a vague review but that's how it had to be for the Winter Lager. There just wasn't anything there. I was hoping to enjoy this one too. It was a disappointment.

Appearance- Pours a rich, amber chestnut that looks so smooth in the glass... a classic two-finger bone white head slowly subsides to a complete, unbroken cap atop the beer. Bubbles are tiny and very uniform, and there's very little lacing.  Smell- The first thing I noticed after immediately cracking this one open was the dark malty notes coming forth. The spices here are confusing and not easily identifiable... I'm getting a lot more bread and yeast with a little more citrus (orange peel) than holiday spices.  Taste- As with this year's Octoberfest release, I'm pleasantly surprised with the big biscuity character on the palate. For a winter warmer, this lacks the depth of flavor and intensity that I think belongs in a beer of this style... but the hint of ginger and orange peel makes this a delicious and unique beer regardless. The roasty malt backbone adds some welcome richness to the texture, and a wheaty huskiness rides nicely alongside.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- This beer's rolling and slick carbonation is certainly enjoyable, and it further punctuates the nice balance of all ingredients.

35,101,Cwrw,3.88,"This one has been available in Alberta for a while, but I have always forgot to review it on here. Blue labelled 300ml bottle, with a bit on the back telling about the ""Saigon Cinnamon"" used in brewing this winter beer. The beer's colour is a lovely ruby/off purple colour that shimmers a hazy nectarine hue. The head is solid and billowy, slightly dimpled with good staying power. It stayed at perfect level, just topping the glass. The foam is a dirty dull white, hints of light red and brown throughout. Thick islands of lace. A great looking spiced beer, perfect for the dinner table in winter. The aroma is subtle and warming, with the promised cinnamon aroma and a light but grainy malt that is sweet but balanced with a little citrus hopping. There is some tangy lime or apricot in the smell, adding a little salinity. The tangy fruits actually become more pronounced the farther you go with this beer's aroma, and I found it a little odd. It just feels as though it should not be there next to the cinnamon and dark malts. However, besides that the aroma is very nice, with the likes of maple syrup, brown sugar, buttered bread, a little black licorice, and other anonymous spices. Inhaling in close with the nose very near there are some very sugary candy notes as well. All of this with no off-putting strongness or alcohol astringency; this is a very subtle but appetising aroma. Warm, soft, almost relaxing. The taste is medicinal and full of cinnamon and brown bread malts. There is some clove and and other spices that seem to remind me of my grandmother's kitchen. Cumin, caraway. Definite licorice and horehound here. The malts are nicely combined with the volume to give a light barleywine flavour as well. The taste is woody and vinous, with a full body and low, creamy carbonation. Drinkability is high, and this goes down easily in both winter and summer. A nice little dark lager.

Sweet, sweet caramel malt flavour--almost to the point of be cloyingly sweet, but not quite--blends well with that Saigon cinnamon they mention on the back label, it's what also jumps to the forefront at first. Then comes some banana flavour, nutmeg, clove and some ginger, rounded out nicely with some light spicy hops. And the mouthfeel is gorgeous: full, rich and velvety smooth for any style of lager, it hugs you from the inside. It's a month before it's best before date still, and I'm fully enjoying this winter warmer on a hot sunny day in April. Good stuff, glad I happened across it at the last minute. Hope we get some more of this in next year.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,SkeeterHawk,3.61,"Appearance: Pours a crystal clear burnt orange color with a half-inch of tannish foam maintained by numerous bubbles rising. The head maintained for well over a minute though the number of rising bubbles tapered off a bit. There is some ""splotchy"" lacing left on the glass after drinking.  Aroma: The malt is in charge of the aroma with some noticeable Munich malt toastiness and a slight roasty contribution. Deeper in the aroma there is a dark caramel aroma to go along with a subtle spiciness. As the beer warms up a bit, the caramel plays a lot bigger role.  Taste: The flavor follows the aroma pretty well. There is a dominating caramel component that pretty much runs the show. There is quite a bit more hops noticeable in the flavor as in the aroma in that they contribute a soft floral balance to the sweetness of the malt. The malts stay in charge of the flavor profile, and the roast that I got in the nose is a big player in the finish of this beer. There is some bittering from the hops, but the roast give it a bitter acidic edge in the finish. Even though the content of this beer is pretty low, I get a bit of warming on the back of the throat late in the finish.  Opinion: Well, this isn't too bad of a beer. It is quite sweet and a bit one sided for my opinion. I would prefer a bit more of a dry contribution form the grain bill to balance the caramel. As it is, the sweet caramel and roast run the show, and there is a bit of floral hops thrown in to obscure the mix. It is an all right beer, but I will be looking to see what is next to it in the cooler next time.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Drew966,4,"Samuel Adams Winter Lager pours a very nice copper color with a fluffy off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. I like the aroma, it has a bit of citrus in it.

That decent head disappears fast, no lacing.  Taste is good but similar to a lot of other beers. I often have this beer on tap, because it is the best choice out of a lot of not-so-spectacular choices (i.e., Bud, Coors) at a restaurant I frequent.  The taste starts out on the sweeter side but finishes more on the bitter side. It's a pleasant, familiar taste.  Sam Winter is a decently-priced seasonal choice. It's enjoyable but not particularly memorable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

S: Fruitiness & malt with some hops and a slight bit of cinnamon.  T: Im tasting berry and citrus malt sweetness and the distinct Sam Adams hops flavor, but not much else. Its not a bad taste, just not anything special.  M: Very smooth, medium-to-heavy body, medium carbonation, not as thick as other winter seasonals that Ive had and its a little sweeter and yet more crisp than the Sam Adams Old Fezziwig Ale.  D: Its not over-powering and goes down easy, not very filling.  Ive liked all of the beers that Ive had from Boston Beer Co. so far.

A dark wheat malt liquor brewed with winter spices(Thank you Texas Alcoholic Beverage Comission nazis). A notch by April is on this bottle.  Appearance: slightly hazy deep amber color. A decent tan head forms on top with good retention.  Smell: Definite malt sweetness, some caramel, toffee, light citrus, cinnamon, ginger, and a touch of alcohol. Sorta does smell like the holidays, has a gingersnap aroma that is mediocre when compared to Anchor's OSA.  Taste: Medium bodied sweet malt starts it off. Slight cinnamon flavor with some spicyness. Finishes with toffee, caramel, and a touch of astringency.  Notes: not bad. Its a little on the bland side.

35,101,normZurawski,3.71,"Not a bad tasting beer. Sometimes I have to remind myself that SA isn't a macro brew, and they do produce a decent beer. This Winter Lager is an example of that, having a smooth spicy body with only a slightly rough finish. That finish, plus the aroma which I find generally unpleasant, is what keeps this from being a solid 4.0/good beer for me. All in all, the taste is good, as is the drinkability. Plus it looks good. So it's got that going for it, which is nice.  Second bottle of this reinforces what I thought on the first. It's not exceptionally smooth. It's not entirely rough, but it doesn't have smooth edges, as they say. A slight hoppy bitterness on the mid-late body gives it an interesting delivery on the spices. I'm not refined enough to say what those spices are - suffice it to say that they're patently winter-esque without being overly so, like this year's Anchor winter offering was. Some taste maltiness in this, which I get mostly in the finish. Again, a decent beer. Worth a try.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,elricorico,3.54,"Pours almost cherry red with a foamy head that has a bit of pink in it. The head is slowly backing off as I type, however it seems to have some staying power.  I'm not finding much in the smell, maybe a faint grassiness and a hint of berry juice, but it is faint enough that it may just be my imagination. As it warmed I did note some cinammon starting to become apparent in the aroma.  Taste is much more interesting than the smell was. Starting off with a semi sweet, light berry flavour, the rest of the mouth receives a spice mix that is at once a bit peppery and a bit tart. The finish is grainy, but light, and a touch of cinammon can be found there if you look for it. Not much hops in the end.  Mouthfeel is fairly good for a lager, it is full with a lively carbonation that enhances the beer and is not coarse. Drinkability is very good, especially on a chilly winter night.  Worth having, this is a beer I wouldn't mind revisiting whenever it becomes available.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,akajimmyd,3.55,"Appearance  Nice red copper color. Thin head, no lacing.  Smell  Smells of sweet malts and spice.  Taste  Starts with sweet malts. Nice mild spice in the middle. Could use a bit more hop in the backbone. Smallest hints of the booze.  Mouthfeel  Tingles on the tounge (a bit overcarbonated?) A bit thin for the style.  Drinkability  A very good starter winter warmer. Incredibly drinkable. The score might not reflect it but I really enjoy this beer. Im sure I will pick up another sixer next year.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,kkipple,3.5,"With the temperture outside hovering near freezing, I figured it was a good time to drink my last left-over bottle of Sam Adams Winter Lager. Into the glass it goes!  Pours a hazy amber color. A diminishing head with lots of lacing. Respectable.  Smell is muted, or maybe it's just me, but there's malt, citrus, honey and ginger in there somewhere. Interesting.  Taste is good. A malty beer with a hint of alcohol and some interesting spice flavors. I'm pretty sure there's orange, or some sort of citrus in there, along with what tastes like cloves and ginger. The spices don't overpower the rest of the beer, but compliment it, as they should. Pretty tasty.  Mouthfeel is spicy, tingly and crisp. Reminds me of cold spiced cider.  I have to admit I'm not a lager fan, but this one is alright. It's heavier than most lagers, and the added flavors from the spices keep me drinking it. I don't think it's much of a session beer, but it sure hits the spot on a cold day like today. I'm looking forward to drinking it again next winter.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,MEANxOLDxTOM,2.96,"I was out at bar a while ago and noticed the Sam Adams seasonal on tap. While I normally like Sam Adams i had never had their winter lager. The beer was a nice color, an amber/brown. The smell was of spice, and predominently of spice.  While drinking I found that it tasted much more of spice than of beer, and it might just be that I like the beer before my spice. I understand what the brewer was going for a nice robust holiday brew with added flavor, but I think it falls short. There is just too much going on and I feel that it takes away from the beer overall.  The beer feels like a lager would feel in heavyness, but again the spice was just too much. If you like the spice I say go for it, but to me I could never drink more than one in a sitting.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Jredner,3.5,"Smelled like a fruit cake made with plenty of citrus fruit to give it that tropical Christmas feel. Orangey ,marmalady aroma dominates, but there are plenty of malty and spicy notes beneath that. Taste is sweet caramel malts, citrus, yeast and spice.

35,101,bennetj17,3.61,"A slim creamy head graces the top of this deep, clear, amber brew. Lots of streaming carbonation present throughout. The smell is faint, however, just the aroma of bready malt and mild spice. The first thing I notice in the taste is the cinnamon spice. The malt is caramelly and bread-like, but not real strong in flavor. It tastes very clean like a lager should be, and its well carbonated. Very smooth, and medium thick, it coats well and goes down pretty easy. Not overly strong in flavor or alcohol, this winter warmer is drinkable and enjoyable...",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Mostly sweet up front flavor, nutmeg or cinnamon in the middle with a slightly sour, but still clean finish.  Moderate body coats well.  For a style I typically don't choose due to the tendency of brewers to overspice, I'm impressed with this interpretation. Nice complexity without over or under doing the spices. Good malt balance and relatively easy to drink.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Pretty much everything I could ask for in terms of mouthfeel for this style beer.  D: A definition session beer.

35,101,Domingo,4.17,"A really drinkable brew for the winter. Pours a copper color. Nothing special...but nothing wrong either. Looks like a slightly darker Boston Lager. Smell definitely sets it apart. Husky smell, with a little bit of hops, but finishes with a little cinnamon, orange, and maybe even a little bit of nutmeg. This beer isn't ""spiced"" but it provides it's own natural spice via the combination of flavors. If you took a Boston Lager and gave it a sweeter flavor without as much hop punch, that's where this brew comes in. Flavor comes through with the spice hitting the palate only slightly. I personally found this to be nice as it's just enough to set it apart. Mouthfeel is a little foamy at first, but it settles quickly enough. Drinkability is high. It's a great beer for a winter night at a bar. It's common for this variety to show up at normal macro-only bars, and I find that I could drink it until it's time to go home.

The smell is of toasted malt, caramel, I almost want to say a little orange in there, which I found odd. Taste is quite nice, carameled malts on the forefront with spices of cinnamon and orange peel and the hops kick in for a smooth but tingly ride down the throat and eases into a warm feeling through the torso. And I had to raid the spice cabinet to be sure, but I think I'm picking up something like corriander. Body is great, and the action comes mostly toward end, and I really like the warm feel.

There's just a little bitterness to clean the palate, that lingers into the finish with some spicy/sweet flavors.

But I'm sure it wasn't as bad as this time around. Read on...  The beer poured a very hazy orange, making look almost like apple cider. There was a decent head but not much in the way of head retention.  Things improved in the aroma department, where I detected some spice, and fruits that reminded me of apple and banana. A nice aroma profile for a winter beer.  I found the flavor to be much more disappointing, however. First of all there really didn't seem to be sufficient flavor for a winter beer. It seemed thin, without any ""warming"" properties, and the flavor seemed to further thin out mid-pint. Furthermore, there was a tartness in the aftertaste that I found to be unpleasant. This tartness served to negatively impact the mouthfeel.  I don't know if this was a bad keg or what the story was. I was quite surprised by the flaws in this beers.

Dark fruits, fig/raison/prune, dominate the flavor. Its a full beer in the mouth, and in the middle ground of carbonation.  Drinkability is medium.

Aromas of roasted sugar, burnt wood, and honey seemed to come out. The taste was a dominated by sweet malt, but the finish was bitter. With time, the malt taste was closely followed by a hop bitterness that had flavors of various dried fruits and honey. The texture was soft and sticky with a bit of sweet fruit flavoring that lingered on my tongue.

The head formed decent-sized, then faded quickly into thin film on top of the beer with the accompanying lace.  Aroma: Sweet malty smell with a hint of caramel and brown sugar.  Taste: Caramel malts up front, the mouthfeel is almost chewy. There is a bitter hoppy undertone as well that rounds it out nicely. There are some spices in there as well but I can't identify them. The finish is bitter, with both caramel malts and hops combining exquisistely.  Overall: This is easily my favorite of the Sam Adams brews.

The aroma is on the weak side, a malty sweetness dominates with not much else to speak of. The taste is delightfully nuanced. A malty sweetness presides, leaving a slight stickiness in the mouth. There is a bit of a nutmeg and cinnamon taste in the beginning and a slight bit of fruitiness in the background. The malt is king here though. As I already mentioned, it has a fair amount of sweetness, but this is cut by a nice toasted malt element that provides a biscuity taste, which keeps the sweetness from becoming cloying. The mouthfeel is fairly chewy for a lager, adding a nice amount of sturdiness. It is fairly drinkable, though it becomes a bit less appealing when it warms up.

Sweet malt flavor, with caramel and brown sugar notes. Very clean for how sweet it is -- could this cleaness come from this beer's use of wheat? Almost no hop flavor, but that's not what this beer is about. As it warms, the cinammon spice emerges as a spicy hot bite in the finish, very nice. Flavorful for a pretty light body.  This is a tasty beer and I commend BBC for using spice subtly. And it actually does taste like higher quality cinammon than the supermarket variety as the label touts.

Smell: See notes above.  Taste: Tasted of Christmas spices (cinnamon, ginger, clove, and allspice). Reminds me a lot of ginger snaps. The on-tap seemed to have a little more bitterness on the back end than the bottled.  Mouthfeel: Biggest difference between the bottle and the tapped is the mouthfeel. The bottle is more like a typical ale in the mouthfeel while this seemed to be nearly as creamy as a stout until the head fell. It still seemed to have more body than normal. Excellent.

Very smooth on the palate; seems to be going down faster then most beers I drink. Like most good beers, it tastes best as it warms a little. Could stand to be heartier in body and alcohol for a WW, but the way it stands, its quite tasty and drinkable. I'd never refuse one...unless there was something better of course ;)",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,mrasskicktastic,2.54,"A - Pours a decent one finger head that dissipates in about two minutes leaving a delicate ring of lacing behind. Color is a clear ruby amber.  S - Rice lager odor and then a caramel sweetness with a bit of dates in the mix. It is faint and not that good.  T - Strong grain presence, seems part rice, part barley, it is a little unpleasant, others might not mind it, but it isn't quite the flavor I hope for in a beer like this. There isn't any real spices decernable, maybe a touch of fruit cake syrup . . . is that a spice? There is a lingering sweetness in the aftertaste with just a touch of bitterness underneath it.  M - Froths in you mouth to a nice level. Without the frothing, the viscosity is a little thin. A fairly refreshing brew though.  D - This is drinkable, although I would certainly prefer other beers to it. Would work well with some foods (Christmas goose perhaps?). I don't want another really, I don't know what it is, but I don't like this beer much at all.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,beerfox,4.13,"Coppery-red body with a thin, off-white head that sat like a veil on the body beneath. Lacing sheeted the glass initially, but did not endure.  Aromas are of sweet malt, nuts and light winter spices - perhaps cinnamon and ground nutmeg.  Flavors of sweet malt paralleled the aromas, with spiciness lingering in the background. Surprisingly well balanced with firm hops that were not as apparent in the aromatic profile. Very nice! Alcoholic warmth tiptoed in the back-door, a welcome guest and an unexpected treat.  Mouthfeel was medium and silky.  Very drinkable session beer for a winter evening. Great balance and lingering warmth make this highly satisfying.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,woemad,3.15,"12oz bottle picked up at Huckleberry's in Spokane. According to the label, this is ""a dark wheat malt liquor brewed with winter spices."" It is noteworthy that hops are not mentioned at all. According to the notch on the side of the label, this is good until May, presumably of '06.   Poured a clear dark amber color, with a small off-white head. Spotty lace.  I got sweet malts, faint spiciness, and very faint earthy wheatiness from the nose of this beer - in that order.  The spiciness is what hits the taste buds first, followed by the almost anemic wheat taste. The swet malts are a strong supporting player throughout. This could use a little hoppiness, or maybe a stronger wheat taste. This is a beer without oomph, and it needs whatever can provide that. After the spices first hit, the remainder of the taste is pretty boring.  Mouthfeel of this beer could benefit by a little bit more carbonation. This is a somewhat lifeless beer, and feels like an all-malt lager in the mouth, and I think it was meant to be a little more than that.  An enormously average beer, and not a memorable winter beer at all. I won't feel the need to try this again.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,cracgor,2.17,"So I drank this beer a couple times this year before I decided to review it. In years past I don't remember being quite as disappointed as this year, thus the delay. It poured out like any other dark amber beer with an average head. It smells pretty good. Like a sweet spiced lager might. No overwhelming hops. Just good clean fun.  Taste was where I was severely lost. This years attempt is too spicy and not beery enough. Every sip reminded me of oyster crackers more than beer. Just stale oyster crackers. The spiciness was not so overwhelming, just poorly balanced. The mouthfeel was also quite disappointed, leaving a lingering bad astringent feeling in my mouth. Just disappointing all around and not recommended this year. All in all, it was barely drinkable, even when my palate was worn out severely the first time I had it this season.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

To me quite sweet. little tastes of roasted malts. some alcohol trickles out right as i swallow. not complex at all. just a malty sweetness. i taste no hop presence.  Mouthfeel is ok. good carbonation, but i think unbalanced.... i need more hops.  Overall not a bad beer, but not a 6-pack i will pick up again.... at least not this year. i would say avoid unless your selection sucks. i would much rather the normal lager or ale to this one.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,marksto,2.93,"I'm a big fan of Sam Adams beers, but I must say that this one has been a dissapointment since they messed with the recipe a number of years ago. Back in the 90's when it first became available in my area this beer was a beautiful weissbock. Now it's a marginal ""winter warmer.""  The spices are what ruin it for me. Although they are not dominant, they are noticible in the nose and palate. To me, spices should either be front-and-center or not there at all. The body and maltiness are also not what they used to be. It's is a perfectly drinkable beer, but not as special as it used to be. There are plenty of other Sam Adams beers worth seeking out, but this is not one of them.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,mooseisloose,3.43,"I was drawn by the name Samuel Adams, self proclaimed brewer of the finest brews. To date not disappointed. So I see this Winter Brew and its a must try. In a pilsner glass the head is powerful to say the least. The beer pours a robust copper color. A fine lacing is left on the sides of the glass as the head recedes like a tide down east. The smell is pungent and apple-like spicy reminds me of autumn and the changing of the colors. The taste is also spicy apple like with hints of cinnamon and allspice. Good weight, more than a characteristic lager. A pleasure to drink, a great companion to a hearty meat and potatoes meal. Not necessarily just a winter beer but should be out just before Thanksgiving. A bit hearty for a session beer but for any meal is excellent.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,weeare138,3.92,"Appears a deep red brown with a slight red tone to it and a light tan head that slowly fades into a a small collar. Streaky lacing. Smell is of dark wheat malt, caramel, mild cloves, cinnamon,and touch of apple, orange peel, and cocoa. Taste is of the same mixed aromas with a decent sweetness that isn't cloying. Mouthfeel is smooth, caramely sweet, slightly pickery with a medium bodied feel and a mild apple and light hop finish. This is a nice beer. It's basically a Dunkelweizen brewed with a lager yeast instead of a Bavarian strain. Kind of a weird hybrid but a good idea that turned out rather nicely. I wish more American brewers would think of inventive hybrid styles like this.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,MSchae1017,3.92,"This was tasted in a mug from teh bottle.  The beer pours a amber color with a nice head that holds a little and laces a little. It smells and tastes like sweet malts and spices - probably cinnamon. There is almost no presence of hops. There is good thickness, but it is a little overcarbonated which seems to be pretty common for a Sam Adams product. But it is one of the better winter seasonals. Sure beats their cranberry lambic and Harpoon's Winter Warmer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Xadoor,3.88,"A dark amber colour in the glass with a good head that left little lacing. Aroma was very slight, but fruity and slightly sweet. Taste is slightly sweet with some caramel malts and spicy hop flavours coming through. Finish is dry with a lingering citrusy aftertaste. Mouthfeel is good, not overly carbonated. Although, since it is a Winter Warmer, I would have perfered a slightly higher ABV so that it actually provides a slight warming affect. However, its an excellent beer and I've drank a lot of them this season.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,rajendra82,3.65,"The second bottle pulled from the 12 pack holiday sampler was the Winter Lager, which is also available separately. The last time I had it was few years back on-tap. And I remember not being too fond of it then. I hadnt tried the bottled version since then, so this was a pretty good chance to see if my tastes had changed.  Poured out of the new Sammy style bottle, the beer looked deep reddish amber in color with a thin and fleeting head. The aroma was a bit off-putting at first with a rotting wood quality, but got better as the time went on. During the later stages of the drink, I could detect cinnamon, and nutmeg via the nose.  The taste was very sweet, with spices providing a weaker counterbalance. Like the smell, the taste took some getting used to, but eventually was quite pleasant. Not the kind of taste I would crave, but nothing offensive about it.  The body was thick and syrupy, with a tongue coating quality. The thickness made me think of a dopplebock with spices at times. The spices opened up a lot more as the beer warmed up, and the taste balanced out better too.  I guess I liked it better this time around. Either they have improved the recipe, or my tastes have grown more accustomed to the type of flavors this beer exhibits. Whatever the case may be, I will probably not avoid it any more.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Nice and drinkable and an easy choice that is readily available around the holidays.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,TheEclecticGent,2.86,"This winter warmer brew was a tad bit disappointing. Not bad but to me it fell short in the flavor department. It poured a clear amber color that formed a light head that quickly disappeared. The smell was a very, very light hoppy and fruity smell. The taste is also very light with slight wheat and hop overtones. The carbonation gives a bit of a sharp bite to the tongue. The mouth feel is also light and even.

Flavor is caramel/toffee sweet, with some creamy, spicy notes - like a gingerbread cookie with whipped cream on top. Mouthfeel is surprisingly rich for a winter warmer lager which makes for an indulgent drink, but makes it a filling experience. A very nice warmer here, very well executed.

I like the dark amber color and sediment rushing along with the carbonation to the top, producing a substantial milky white head. The nose is faint and difficult to define..I get sugars, yeast, and a little pale malt. Also a mix of hops. A monster draught reveals chocolate and toasted malts and a well balanced body finishing sweet and tasty. The mouthfeel is reserved and not overcarbonated, which is a huge plus. One minus might be that the brew is a little thinner than I would prefer.

Smell: Sweet malts and orangy hops are on the nose, along with a few spices. There is a dominant spice but I can't put a finger on what it is.  Taste: Slightly bitter at first followed by a malt that I associated with sourdough bread. Leaves a bitter taste (grapefruity hops?) in your mouth for a while after each sip, which is very pleasant. Spices (not sure which ones...little experience with them) are distinctly present. This beer is good.  Mouthfeel: The carbonation is excellent, and the beer is silky smooth, just as a lager should be.  Drinkability: Great.

The head left lacing around the top of the glass and did not prove have very good retention. The nose was malt with heavy spices (cinnamon) and some fruitiness. This lightly carbonated brew had a thick, more syrupy texture but a medium body. The beer's flavor proved to have some similarity to a brown ale. The beer's taste lacked the spiciness and fruitiness of its aroma, and predominately featured a maltiness along with a faint cinnamon.

Taste of orange rindy hops, touch of cinnamon, nutty malt aftertaste, but the flavors are all doing their own thing without any transition from one to the next. Also some harshness that wasn't exactly bitter, just not pleasant.  Medium carbonation goes with medium body. Could be more smooth, maybe that isn't what they were going for, who knows with a warmer.  An average winter offering with kudos on the varied, season oriented smell. Maybe letting one rest for a year would bring the flavors together.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

The bottle claims that this beer has been brewed with ""winter spices,"" but I honestly cannot taste them at all, except perhaps for an EXTREMELY understated nutmeg character. Tangy yeast adds an interesting edge, but otherwise this is more or less just an average red lager.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and clean; flavorful without being aggressive or overpowering.

Could definitely smell the spices, I'm figuring cinnamon and nutmeg. The flavor was nicely balanced between the spices and malt flavor. Nothing too overpowering. The spices were noticible first and then smooth, rich malt and spice flavor. This beer is heavier and has a stronger mouthfeel than what I am used to (lagers, marzens and Pale Ales).

Smell; sweet roasted malts dominate, with a little nutmeg, cinammon and a some caramel.  Taste; I get nutmeg upfront, then some biscuity malts and caramel, and some other spices I can't put my finger on. Mouthfeel was a litlle thin for what I like a winter warmer, but the carbonation was nice and smooth. I don't usually go for the Sam Adams beers anymore as I tend to be a bit disapointed in them nowadays, but I was surprised how good this was.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,ColoradoBobs,4.17,"In the winter sampler pack.  A: Dark clear amber-brown topped by an off-white, mostly fading small head that leaves only a small ring, but a surprising amount of lacing.  S: Malty-biscuity with a bit of coffee in the background, toasted white bread with apple-butter(?) on it.  T: More malt depth and sweetness, but not cloying. Nice dry hoppiness without too much bitterness. A bit of sourness is there too -- nice surprise: reminds me a little of a Belgian Dubbel. There's a spiciness that is quite notable -- pepper, cloves stuck into whole oranges. Really nice.  M: Nice round thickness. Much fuller feel than you might think from the small head.  D: Goes down nice and smooth. May I have another, please?  Overall, surprisingly delightful and rich beer. A macro with a craft touch. Gotta go get some more. Sad there are only two in the twelve-pack.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,nathanho,2.8,"Stong pour, ample head, moderate lacing, bland amber - slight haziness?  Light wheat and spice smell; strong metal & some citrus.  Malt, spice, metal - metal ruins taste as well as good aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is good except ruined by pervasive metal.  Metal ruins decent drinkability, also.  Tastes like it came out of a dirty tap. I like this beer minus the metal - did I mention the metal? Perhaps a re-review is in order at a later point in time.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,DarkerTheBetter,3.71,"This beer came an orange gold with a creamy head that fell a bit but was sustained for the duration. Smells like a little cranberry sourness, an apple sweetness, a slight dry hop and a bit of grain. Tastes like blueberries, currants a touch of grapefruit with nice molasses sweetness. A few spices seem to be hiding in here as well. Mouth feel is full with a light carbonation. This is a tasty sipping beer. Lively enough to get your attention, but not overpowering.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,SacoDeToro,3.95,"Let's give credit where credit is due. Despite the relative size and popularity of Sam Adams beers, they still make a very worthy effort to please the afficionado with a large selection of tasty full-time, limited edition and seasonal beers. Okay, I'm still trying to forgive them for Sam Adams Light, but whatever...  The Winter Lager is a very balanced and flavorful bock-type beer. It's color is a dark amber with a light tan head that disipates quickly. The aroma is heavy on sweet caramel maltiness. No hop aroma is present and the hops in this beer due their job in just balancing out the intense Munich maltiness. There is an addition of wheat malt which adds some creaminess to the brew as well. Alcohol is present on the nose with slight banana undertones. Considering the intense maltiness of this beer, the mouthfeel is not too thick or chewy, which makes it easy to quaff.  Grab a bottle and let it prepare you for the Sam Adams Double Bock this Winter.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Shovelbum,3.5,"Arrived with a thin white head over a translucent brown-body. Light aroma of caramel malt. More caramel malt in the flavor with a noticeable hop bitterness and tea-like grain notes. Lean to medium in body. Slightly crisp in the mouth, finishes smooth with a mild hop bitterness in the aftertaste.  A bit more hop character than the standard SA Boston lager. Darker and more body too, but not as well balanced as its non-seasonal counterpart. Although, the warming alcohol presence does help it out.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,stof0048,4.2,"A: Poured this into a beer mug. Poured an amber color with a thin head that quickly disipated. Moderately sticky lacing.  S: Malts, dark candies, hint of spice and some floral aromas.  T: Dark malts, slightly hoppy flavor, dark sugars/fruits (plums...). Actually rather imressed with this beer (this is actually my first sampling of Sam Adams).  M: Nice mouthfeel, smooth, medium body, carbonation become apparent as it goes over the tongue.  D: Pretty easy to drink, will definitely have to acquire a little more of this stuff as I could easily enjoy a few of these in a night.  Overall, I'm very impressed with this. I haven't actually tried any Sam Adams before this but must admit that it's better than I was expecting. Can't wait to try again.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,rowew,3.97,"Presentation: Purchased as part of the Holiday sampler. 12 oz longneck with Samuel Adams embossed on the neck. Best by date notched on the label.  Appearance: Pours a dark amber color with a very frothy, large head. Head leaves quite a bit of lacing as it slowly fades. Very good retention.  Smell: Sweet malt, and as it warms up you can detect some pumpkin pie spice aromas in there. Just a hint of floral hops.  Taste: Smooth mouthfeel, medium bodied. Sweet malt start and then a little bit of floral hop flavor. The spice comes mainly in the aftertaste.  Overall impression: Nice winter warmer - not overly complex but well made. Nice for the cold winter evenings to come.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,metallistout,4.45,"I could have swore that this beer tasted different a couple of years ago. Still a good brew, but I thought that it had more hop presence in it.  Pours a reddish copper color, with a large foamy head that stuck around for a pretty long while.  Smells of orange, cinnamon, ginger, pine?, and malty tones.  Tastes mostly of malt, a decent amount hops, but mostly spices of the aromas nature.  Deffinately taste the spices and malt, a good beer, but I would prefer maybe a little more hops. I had to review this beer over because I drank it a different temperature(let it warm up a little)and it had much more flavor. I was thinking that it needed to be really cold like most lagers, but you can pretty much drink it at ale temperatures.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,danielharper,4,"Purchased from Target in Jones Valley, Huntsville, AL.  I poured this into a clean pint glass -- it formed a dark amber body with a tiny off-white foamy head that stuck around for the length of the beer, despite being thin. Looks a bit like soap suds at the end of the brew.  Aroma is strong with fruit and quite a bit of winter spices. Very nice, floral bouquet here -- I'm enjoying the nose quite a bit and find it very inviting for the beer as a whole, despite not being incredibly complex.  Grainy and granulated spice presence up front on the taste, with a fruity finish and a slight astringent aftertaste. No real hop presence noted, but the yeast gives this a pleasant flavor overall. Nice.  Mouthfeel is moderate-to-thick, coating the throat and palate admirably and leaving me wanting more. Mild carbonation helps to keep this one smooth but interesting.  I guess it's a four straight down. This is far from a perfect beer, but it's very pleasant, doesn't get in the way of itself, and makes me happy to be drinking it. Nothing really amazing, but for what it is it is relatively flawless. High marks for style.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Tim460,3.83,"Pours a dark amber with an off white, slightly tan head. Smells malty, cinnamon, with a slight hint of caramel and citris. Taste is caramel with malt sweetness, though slightly bitter in the back end. Medium bodied, goes down smooth but carbonation is apparent. Highly drinkable with its low alcohol and mild taste, not too sweet. I enjoy the Winter Lager more than their other seasonal offerings, but there are several better available in this years holiday 12 pack.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,jakester,3.92,"This is from the Sam Adams Winter sampler case. I drank it in a goblet. Expiry date clearly notched on the label.  Pours a hazy copper/brown with a 1/2 finger head of off-white foam. The head eventually falls to islands and a ring, with minimal lacing. Carbonation looks medium.  Aroma is spicy cinnamon, citrusy, (from wheat?), sweet caramel, with no real fruit smells. Almost smells like a wheat bock.  Flavor is smooth citrusy wheat, sweet caramel, cinnamon, and vanilla. Not fruity at all, but clean and slightly sweet. Aftertaste is sweet and spicy from cinnamon.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with medium carbonation across the tongue. Finish is lip-smacking sweet.  This is a pretty straightforward holiday beer, but the wheat certainly adds a nice complexity. There is the usual cinnamon flavor, with the added citrus/tartness from wheat. Dark malts make this caramel sweet and rich. Recommended.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,whartontallboy,3.8,"Pours out a slightly-cloudy light-brown color with a fairly large off-white head of big bubbles and streaming carbonation.  Smell is fruity, with some lemon and orange citrus notes coming through, with lots of caramel, baked-bread, and a little bit of alcohol.  Flavor is similarly doughy, with biscuit and caramel flavors coming to the front, and the little citric fruitiness blending well with some spices, cinnamon and nutmeg maybe, underneath. The alcohol is not present like it is in the nose. Mouthfeel is light-medium.  Overall: Solid, drinkable winter warmer, but not as good as Old Fezziwig.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Pours a nice dark copper color and makes a nice fluffy eggshell colored head that lingers around for a bit, makes some nice lacing as well. Aroma is strong of malt and winter spices, particularly cinnamon. Rich malty flavor, very little bittering or hop character, very slight spice in the background, a bit bready, some caramel sweetness. Light to medium body, peppery carbonation, finishes a bit sticky. Not bad, but not my favorite offering from Boston Beer Co.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

I detect a slight spicy aroma as well. It has a very slightly fruity aroma also. I detect a very subtle, mild hop aroma. This beer tastes biscut like. It is malty sweet. I taste a decent spice flavor. Cinnamon flavors are noticable. It has a very slight hop flavor, but it is almost not detectable. This beer goes down smooth leaving a spicy, biscut like aftertaste. This beer is maybe just a little over carbonated. I think this beer would make an excelent session beer. It is low in alcohol, and the mild flavor is quite appealing. This is always one of the beers I look forward to at Christmas time.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Breadlike tatse. light Very malty giving it a fruity raisin flavor. A little winelike. Nice light bitter finish. Crisp and clean.

35,101,bahumutx,3.58,Served from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a brilliant copper in color. Very nice looking beer. Had a 2 finger head that is dissipating slowly.  Smell: Smells of malt and a slight cinnamon smell. A slight wheat smell is also present.  Taste: Starts off sweet with a malt presence. There are hints of cinnamon and ends with a wheat taste and slight hop bitterness. There is also a slight alcohol warming which is appropriate for the style.  Mouthfeel: Good Mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation.  Drinkability: Very drinkable. Could have a few of these in a sitting.  This is my first beer of this style and look forward to trying others. Once again a good offering from the Boston Brewing Company. Keep up the good work!!,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Naes,3.26,"This is a dark brown lager with hues of amber/red showing through. The head is a two finger off white froth that leaves behind decent lacing. The aroma is of cinnamon and malt. The flavor is dominated by the malt, with a slight hop presence and the cinnamon and spice in the finish. Mouth feel is light bodied and highly carbonated. Although the malt is the dominant flavor in this brew, it is not overpowering. This is not a stand out beer, but is still a quality one. Its not a bad addition to the winter mix pack.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,fromage,3.65,"Probably my favorite of the winter mix pack.  Poured slightly warmed into a pilsner glass. Dark amber color, with a great deal of bubbling. Small white head that quickly faded.  Smell wasn't so good coming out of the bottle--got a lot of ethanol. Once poured, I caught whiffs of brown sugar and cinnamon, maybe best described as cinnamon raisin bread. Some caramel. Not terribly complex.  Good bite, somewhat gingery. Moist sweet bread again. Fades into a spicey finish, cinnamon and ginger.  Good medium mouthfeel. A bit too much carbonation at first, but satisfying later.  I could definitely drink a few of these. A beer you can keep tasting and that doesn't really fade away. Definitely good with a wide array of food too.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Dewey0603,3.46,"Another Sam beer with a nice two finger head and a dark amber color.You can say what you want,their beers always look good.The smell is a little disappointing,average at best,with some spices and a little cooked veggie smell.This does taste pretty good however.A nice mix of malt and holiday spices make me look forward to this beer each year.It's not Sam's best beer,but it's still pretty good.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Mitchel,3.28,"Definitely a great color, a dark red/copper. An off-white, head with smooth lace and strong carbonation. Smells of delicate cinnamon and orange with bolder aroma of toasty malt.  A little too much carbonation for my taste; it seems to kick you right in the teeth as soon as it touches the tongue. This beer has the classic bitterness of Sam Adams products but is nicely hopped. This is an especially toasty and very malty beer, but this is exactly what one should be looking for in a winter brew. Really well rounded beer with a great warming feeling for those chilly winter nights; enjoy in front of the fire.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,chOAKbarrell,3.5,"Deep brown color. Aroma of cinnamon and ginger which blends with the roasty sweetness of the malted barley and hint of citrus from the orange peel.

35,101,mattcrill,4.18,"Part of the Beers of Winter sampler pack.  Appearance: A clear ruby pour with a dirty white head develops. No visible carbonation noted in the body.  Smell: A touch of carmel, maple syrup, and some light yeasty notes on the aroma.  Taste: Maple, honey, carmel, and a vague nuttiness all jump off the palate. Very delicate and nicely balanced. A touch toward the sweet end but never cloying or over the top. Malt is assertive but not over done.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and enjoyable carbonation.  Drinkability: Highly quaffable. Another fine example from Sam Adams. Winter warmers don't generally impress me but this one is well done. I like it and I could even see warming this up and adding some mulling spices. Definitely recommended.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

35,101,shererjt,2.73,"Poured a dark red-copper clear. Light carbonation and a small head. Full aroma; raisins and cherries(?) but not much in the way of hops or malt.  Medium-to-full body and very fruity for a lager. Lots of cherry flavor. Some malt, but the fruit/spice dominates. I wouldn't describe the flavor as bad, though I wouldn't say it's particularly good either. Has a little sourness that's balanced by a malty finish. Definitely intended for sipping.  This is a hard beer for me to describe. The spice/flavoring is too overpowering to get a feel for the underlying beer. While I generally enjoy winter beers tremendously, this one just didn't do it for me. I think toning down the other stuff and ramping up the beer itself would improve it, but then again there's no accounting for taste.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,ryantupy,4.25,"I picked this one up at Old Chicago for their winter beer fest and found it to be much more enjoyable that I expected it to be. It poured a very nice reddish copper color with a small head. It smelled mostly of toasted hops and spices. It ahs a nice level of carbonation and tastes great. It has a nice kick to it making it a very enjoyable beer. It tastes of spices, toasted hops, and a hint of caramel.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,shbobdb,3.77,"Let me start this by saying I don't like spiced beer. However, I did not hate this beer, in fact, I drank both bottles from the sampler. It is much less spicy than the Fezziwig ale, and the spice is brought more in line with the malt flavour. The clean, lager yeast also helps cut down on the random assault on the tongue. I found this to be a highly balanced, even enjoyable, brew. I never thought I would say such nice things about a spice beer! It even makes me curious about other spice beers, maybe they don't all suck.  Once again, say 'thanks' to Jim for producing a solid 'gateway' beer into a style I had not considered even remotely drinkable before. I'm sure it's not the best of its style, but it's tame enough for everyone to enjoy.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,KroMagnon,3.61,"The head was very low - surprisingly for a wheat-based beer (it says its wheat based on the bottle). The beer is a light brown color and seems more highly carbonated than a 'regular' beer. The aroma has a mild toastiness and maltiness, with some hops (or spices, hard to place) and is very clean. The beer's taste is flavorful with a nice rounded malty presence. There is a minor tartness and a slight bitterness at the end but this is only there to balance the beer. Overall this is a little uninspiring but not too bad. It doesn't really seem like a 'winter warmer' to me, though - a little light for that.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,mmmbeer,3.72,"12 oz., purchase before April notched on the back, along with a blurb about the cinnamon they used.

Cinnamon and ginger immediately on the palate, with other spices, dark/caramel malts, and maybe some hops, along with a crisp, medium mouthfeel.

Good price ($3.25) made this a great sippin session brew",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,ski271,3.84,"Pours a beautiful, clear, dark, reddish-copper with a small, off-white, tight head that quickly diminished to a thick film. Some decent lacing, especially early. The smell is mild and has a sweet caramel maltiness with some light spice and a hint of fruit. The taste is impressive, especially considering the lackluster initial nose. Big thick flavors of caramel, cookie and wheat, along with some herbs, leathery yeast and something else I cant put my finger on. It has a much larger body than expected and is lightly syrupy with low carbonation. Its a very interesting offering from BBC. Very enjoyable, and a bit on the low end of the spectrum of winter warmers as far as spices go, which is a good thing in my opinion. I hate when brewers go overboard on things like pickling spice. Definitely not a problem here, though my friends that do like the big spice flavors of winter warmers might be a bit disappointed by this beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Smell: A nice mix of cinnamon, cloves, cherries and nutmeg greet your nose. Balanced, at seems appropriate for the cold months.  Taste and Mouthfeel: The taste is very similar to the smell, but bland and watered down. Sure, the cinnamon tastes nice and all, but I want more of it. This is leaving me wanting. The mouthfeel is thin, but smooth.  Drinkability and Overall: Weak. That's pretty much all I have to say about this. It tastes good, smells even better, but it's just a pansy version of what a winter warmer can be. This one doesn't warm you at all. Isn't that the point of the style anyways?",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Well overall this tastes like a porter mixed with a dunkle. Weird. But it was nice with fruity malts and and allright almost of hop flavors. This is mildly spiced.

Appearance: Big foamy odd-white head, nice lacing sticking around the top, tons of bubbles surfacing from the bottom of the glass, and the color brown and hazy with some amber hues.  Smell: Some sweet malt and clove initially, some gingerbread, slight vanilla, slight maple, pepper-like spice, slight cinnamon, and maybe some dark fruit. Very warming and welcoming.  Taste: Sweet malt and spices come with the first sips. Not much hop bitterness at all, but there's slightest present to not make it overly sweet thankfully, as that could ruin it pretty easily. Lots of maple and vanilla, more spice at the finish. Just very balanced, pretty complex, and surely great for warming in winter.  Mouthfeel: Moderate carbonation, a medium body, slightly creamy and full in the mouth. Very nice.  Drinkability: Maybe my favorite Sam Adams brew, and maybe (aside from the Doppelbock in my opinion) their best seasonal. Very good for any time of year, especially for winter.

It was on special at a taphouse in Raleigh, so I decided to order it, even though there were well over 100 other more exotic beers to be had. I'm glad I made the choice. It was poured wih a foamy creamy head, large, atop a golden orange/amber body. The head left great lacing and had the aroma of sweetness, spice, hops and mild yeast. The taste was as smooth as I've had, with yeasts, hops and honey. It finished very clean and sweet, with a wonderful creamy aftertaste.

Everything is very well rounded, the spices are just a little subdued for my tastes, but overall this is a nice flavorful malty winter warmer.

Winter pours a pretty dark and clear amber color with a slight white head. There is surprisingly little bubble activity and not much lacing to speak of.  Smells of malt, yeast and a bit of caramel. Spices--mainly cinnamon--are also noted in the nose. Good balance overall.  The taste is a pretty nice mix of malt and spice. Quite a bit of sweetness on the whole. There is also a not unpleasant burn at the end of the sip. As the beer warms, toffee and caramel are there as well.  In the mouth this beer is biting and burns just a little. Pretty high carbonation but full flavor.  Overall, this is my favorite Samuel Adams brew. It is a well-balanced, strong flavored and very impressive effort.

Sweet malty flavor. Caramel and dark wheat. I get some toffee and nutty flavors too, but very mild. Gentle but tasty spices, much less than Old Fezziwig or Harpoon Winter Warmer, which I would would say are similar brews. Even has a sweet finish, no hops to speak of.  Thin mouthfeel, more carbonation than I expected.  Great drinkability! One of my favorite Sam offerings and by far my favorite winter beer. Sweet and tasty and always welcome in my home.

35,101,PBRstreetgang,4,"Pours a ruby orange hue, with good clarity. A creamy, off-white two finger head holds nicely, but produces weak lacing. Caramel and wheat nose, hiding a slight floral hop aroma. Strong malt sweetness from the wheat and an unrefined sugar taste; with a healthly hop bitterness that balances it out. Medium body and active carbonation leave only a touch of residual sweetness, and renders a good drinkability at the cost of the appropriate alcohol warmth.

Nothing really bad to say, the head is lumpy and adequate at first, then dies down to nothing, and the color is copper brown.  TASTE. Malt, hints of cinnamon and spiciness burning at the edges. Balance is on the sweet side, with just enough hops to make their presence known. Dark caramel, toffee, nutty toasty/roasty like flavors. Small hint of cinnamon graham cracker aftertaste in my mouth after I put the glass down.  Smells like malt mostly, with a little cinnamon. Mouthfeel is slick. Carbonation might be a bit on the high side, but not really a detriment to enjoyment.  Notes: I love love freakin love this beer. My favorite Sam Adam's beer so far (although, to admit I haven't tried very many). At first I was a little surprised, and dissapointed, to learn that the abv on this was less than 6%. I figured a winter warmer ought to be a bit stronger. The beer tastes great the way it is though, and might actually be better for it. I like the quaffability of this beer. The spicing is subtle, and I could drink more than a few bottles over the course of a night without getting sick of it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,BrewMaster,3.06,"Appearance: Hazy red in color with a thin off white head. Head revives stiffly with swirling but then recedes back to thin lacing. Nice lacing on the sides of the glass as the beer is consumed.  Smell: Spritzy malt scent with a slight berry and fruity scent.  Taste: Caramel and a tangy wheat flavor. The middle is sweet and it moves quickly to a soft, fruity ending. All of the flavors in this beer are quick. The ending is short but clean and well rounded.  Mouthfeel: A bit too strong when it comes to carbonation, somewhat strong on the palate. As the beer warms up and loses some of its strong opening carbonation it becomes a smooth and lightly syrupy brew.  Drinkability: Sweet flavor is enjoyable but there isn't much else to this beer. The spices don't come through and the flavor is only average.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Slight aromas of spice, bread, and malt.  T: This has a nice maltiness without being overly sweet or syrupy. Complimented with flavors of cinnamon and other spices, vanilla, and a touch of hops flavor.  M: Medium carbonation with a slight slickness in the mouthfeel. The body feels a little light for me for a winter beer, but the mouthfeel is quite acceptable overall.  D: This is one of my favorite session beers in season. Good flavor for a good price. Reccommended.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Smell is light and slightly spicy. Nutmeg.  First taste starts a bit overwhelming, but quickly fades. I think my taste buds were geared for something lighter based on the aroma. Nutmeg. You can tell there is a nice malt background to this, but much is lost in the spice. Slight dryness in the aftertaste. OK, I wouldnt throw it away after buying the 12 pack, but I wouldnt seek it out either.  After about half way through, I have changed my opinion slightly. Not sure if I can attribute this to the raise in temperature or my taste buds acclimating. The taste is much more rounded.

After having had a couple pumpkin ales this season I can't help but to liken this to them... without the pumpkin part. The spice profile is very similar, but perhaps with some citrus rind in there instead of pumpkinnyness. (the reviews the bros. laid down nail down pretty well all the specific characteristics of this brew). In the time just before I woke up to beer advocacy this was one of my favorite brews.

Aroma: The most dominant aromas are fruit and spice.  Taste and Mouthfeel: As with the aroma, heavy fruit and spice flavors. I can detect the tastes of raisins, dates, citrus, cinnamon, etc. Theres really too much here for me to identify all the subtle tastes (this brew is pleasantly complex). Also, there is a nice roastiness (further adding to the complexity). Also, there is a malty sweetness that isnt too overwhelming. A very mild hoppy bite is there (but only barely). The mouthfeel is somewhat dominated by the carbonation, at least at first, but is otherwise medium-bodied. Finishes with the sweet flavors of fruit and spice.  An impressively complex brew.

Smell: Sweet with notes of spice.  Taste: Some spice in the taste, some caramel as well.  Mouthfeel: Good, smooth - nothing special  Drinkability: I've had better winter beers, but this one is good.

Nice clarity.  Smell: Faint caramel and spices on the nose.  Taste: Caramel, with only a minor hop bitterness in the mix. Medium mouthfeel with a lingering sweet/bitter flavor. Very drinkable, even though this one has obviously been on tap for a bit--everyone else is already getting the spring white ale as their seasonal Sam's.

Smells of malt, ginger other unidentifiable spices, and some alcohol. Not a very strong smelling brew as it takes a few good deep whiffs to register all of the aromas.  The taste starts off with malt, some spiceness, and then a dry finish. Not bad at all...but nothing impressive.  Nice full mouthfeel coats the tongue without being chewy.

35,101,Illini5596,3.37,"Not a bad beer. It skirts the line between beer and ""girly beer"" though with it's added spices and such. A bit more like spiced christmas wine in that regard. For those secure in their manhoods it can be a nice change from your typical beers.

35,101,aquilontendants,4.03,"I sampled this beer at Mama Mia's in Wales, WI on tap served in a shorter Guiness style pint glass. Faint sweet malt smell. Not terribly too aromatic. MIld roasted and very mild alcoholic aroma's. The color is Amber/Red and on the darker side of both hues. Head is slightly off-white and 1/2 the bubbles in the head are nice and tight. The beer is quite clear with bubbles errupting from the bottom of the glass.  Flavors such as caramel, malty sweetness, and hints of spicynes., The spicyness is really trying to fight through the nice balanced malt flavors. Fill's the mouth quite nicely with flavor and a good balanced, medium to light alcoholic warmth. When the beer was about half full, a bit of alcoholic warmth came through, which was welcoming. Towards the end of the drink, the alcoholic presence was almost completly gone and smoothness was left behind. Aftertaste linger's with a blend of sweet/spicy/ and strong flavors.  The mouthfeel is very creamy and it work's very well with this style. The liquid cover's the toungue very well and the full flavors that hit the senses are balanced nicely with this creamy mouthfeel.  This beer (to me) is very drinkable for a winter lager beir. I have not sampled a whole lot of winter lagers, and those I have generally were not this thirst quenching. Being that Samuel Adams Brewing Company made this, it was slightly expected that this beer might lean more towards a more thirst quenching winter lager.

35,101,JMH_,4.1,"The Sam Adams Winter Lager has always been an old winter standby of mine: you know you're going to get a nicely flavoured beer and can find it pretty much anywhere you go, thus being a pleasant saving grace from the likes of Bud, Heineken, Corona, etc on many an occasion.  It pours a nice crisp amber colour with a bigger and stickier than remembered to off-white to tan head.  The smell has a spicy, malty caramel base to it. I can't pick up much in terms of distinct spices, but nutmeg is my best guess at one of them.  The flavour is equally solid, starting with a tingly burst of carbonated spice flavour, moving into a more earth based malt and wheat taste and then finishing with a semi-sweet, semi-dry caramel flavour mixed wit ha bit of wet wood type flavouring.  A nice, basic but tasty winter seasonal overall. It's very easy to drink and just a solid brew overall.

Very rich taste of crisp fruit upfront, apples and plums, but that flavor gets destroyed but an absolutely wonderful creamy chocolate malt and fades into warmer spices. Really nice.

Very nice bonus! Below are the differences between the tap and bottled version of this beer that I already reviewed.  Appearance: Essentially the same as the bottle, but better head retention throughout the drinking of the pint.  Smell: Since the restaurant was serving this beer too cold, the initial scent was a bit faint. As the pint warmed, it's nose was correctly revealed: Same as the bottle, but the malty notes were cleaner and not as sweet. I did not get the port-wine ""mirage"" that I got with the bottle. Also, the hops were definitely more evident, mingling pleasantly with the spices, making it a much fresher scent.  Taste: Same as the bottle, but the maltiness was more subdued and the hops were more evident - a very important difference! Also, there was no cloying in the aftertaste. Instead there was a noticeable, albeit mellow dry hop finish that was very refreshing.  Mouthfeel: Essentially the same as the bottle. Good, but nothing exceptional.  Drinkability: I had my second pint ordered before I was 2/3 finished with the first one - and I finished that first one in about 6 big, satisfying swigs. The main bottle vs. tap difference of subdued maltiness makes this beer very drinkable and very refreshing.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Flavor is slightly dark (not objective, I know, but it''s what I tasted) with light spices (nutmeg and cinnimon) and a very light hop bite.

Almost smells like warm yogurt or something as unappealing as that. I can detect some maltiness under that strange scent though. Taste is passable, but not as direct as I might like. The nutty malts come through, though there's a lot of other flavors that sort of seem to take a back seat. Nothing really meshes well with this beer, it's just sort of a hodge-podge of grains and water. Not a thrilling mouthfeel either, a tad watery.

This beer poured a dark copper hue with about an inch-thick tan head. It smelled somewhat similar to Sam Adams Boston Lager, which is to say decent - not earth shattering.  The taste was so much richer when I let it warm up for a few minutes before drinking it. There was the slighest hint of hop bitterness coupled with an almost sweet taste on the front of my tongue. The spices this beer is supposedly brewed with are not as detectable as you might expect, but it's still quite a good beer.  I could certainly drink more than one of these in a sitting, particularly if I'm just hanging out with friends or enjoying a nice big multi-course meal.

Body is a crystal clear auburn/chestnut with small bubbles slowly rising to the surface. Smells of caramel and gingerbread, spicy, tart, and alive. Metallic from some continental hops. A hint of butter and some eathiness makes it smell like an English ale. Flavor is nondescript smooth caramel that is quickly joined by the metallic bitterness. A cinnamon-sugar taste is present throughout, but in just the right amount. Finish has some chocolate-covered lemon. Feel is thick and very smooth and lightly sweet - like a great candy.

Mouth was smooth and retained good carbonation.  Not such a bad winter warmer but definately less complex than most.

35,101,Bones54,3.23,"Appearence: copper, however rather transparent. Pours a thick head, but does not last to long, eventually becoming a lasting thin cover over the brew. Lacing is minimal. Smell: As far as winter/christmas brews go, none whats so ever. Faint smell of ginger and spice. Taste: pepper and spice is definately present, however not as powerful as I was expecting. Mouthfeel: Definately leaves a sticky taste. Drinkability: much like many winter/christmas brews, the spice only allows me to have a few. I can stomach quite a few more of these than I can of GLB Chirstmas Ale, yet I don't think that's a good thing. There's something to be said for the overwhelming spice that accompanies this style of beer, and I believe Sam Adams is slightly off the mark.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,jdhilt,3.65,"Pours with a two-finger cream head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Clear, deep amber color. Medium bodied. Floral nose. Light-medium carbonation. Starts prickly and malty with a little hops, mellow finish. More flavor as it warms. Much better than their regular lager. 83¢ for a 12oz bottle from Market Basket Concord, NH.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Truh,3,"Met all three ghosts with this one on 12/11/2004. 16-oz. pint pour at Toad in Porter Square, Cambridge, MA.  Stuck, pea coat covering of seemingly creamy head. Deep, ruby red hue to an almost luminescent mahogany hue that is frozen like an icy pond cracking with temperature drops on a still night. Kind of a dewy, pre-pubescent malt character on nose with some nutmeg and just a touch of allspice thrown in for talking points. Washed up on the beach, driftwood malt fire-in-the-hole splash to start, with a me-love-you-long-time promise of some holiday spices, but there simply is no delivery. Malt is weak; simply unimpressed overall.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,orbitalr0x,3.63,"Nice deep amber red pour with a tan head on top. Leaves some lacing in its wake as well. Caramel, cinammon, hints of citrus peel and spice. An odd grainy smell finds its way in there too...  A nice sweet caramel nut malt swirls with a nice blend of spiciness, cinammon and hints of cherries. Hints of wheat grains pop out as the brew goes down.  Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side but it smooth and easy to drink. I could have a few of these and it's nice on a cold night. Almost reminds me of a spiced up oktoberfest brew. Worth a try.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,freed,3.78,"New label this year, but I love this beer.  Pours a mahogany brown with a nice topping of brownish foam. Body has nice clarity and medium carbonation.  The aroma is of wheat and nutty malt with a sweet tarnish to it.  The taste is bready and sweet and has nice malt highlights. The starchiness is a bit much after a while as it makes it necessary to brush one's teeth after a beer or two. Still, the rich, warm, and almost fruity flavor is quite nice, and a winter treat.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,surfmeister,3.06,"I just don't like spiced beer... great copper tone, full, sturdy head with great staying power, the spices in the smell and flavor were not overpowering by any means, I just didn't like em, I guess I just like hops and malt, I don't want my beer tasting at all like a pumpkin pie, also there was a sour note in the aftertaste that really bugged me",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,brewQ,3.88,"A respectable look, bronze color and fine bubbles forming a biscuit atop the brew.  The bottle says dark wheat with spice. I liked the malty caramel but my overworked taste buds can't pick out a particular spice.  A very balanced, drinkable beer. Makes me think well of the brewer in spite of their dorky commercials and tendency avoid distinctive brews.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,misterscooter,3.88,"Served in a very tall, very narrow pilsner glass at California Pizza Kitchen. The beer came out with a great looking head that gave off a great aroma and first taste. The beer was red with a hint of amber and smelled of raspberry and maybe cherry as well as some mild spices like nutmeg. That first taste with some head and beer gave me much of the same. Once I was strictly into the beer, it was smooth, although maybe a little too much carbonation for this type of beer. It did well with my pizza and it is definitely an annual beer that I would have again, although probably only one of these per sitting because of the sweetness.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Higravity,3.9,"This is a slightly better than most middle of the road WW. It has complexity is the smell and the taste of roasted malt and perhaps a prolonged boil. There is some light spicing that must be going on perhaps some oragne zest and nutmeg, but very light touch as the malt prevails and the hops are present only as an after thought. It is a very nice beer that I would drink over SS WW any day.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,dgfair,3.83,"This was my first beer from my 2004 Sam Adams Wimter Classics 12 pack. As a fan of the Boston Lager, I was looking forward to sampling the winter brews from BBC. The Winter Lager is a great start and did not disappoint. It pours a beautiful bright amber color with a slight off-white head about 1/4 inch thick. Not a great deal of aroma here, but I pick up small scents of nutmeg or cinammon that you may expect from a winter selection, plus some light hops and malt. The taste is nice with a good balance of hops and malt, and I also pick up a slight bitter fruity taste, almost reminding of the after-taste of a fresh sour apple. Carbonation is excellent and the lager fills your mouth and body with a jolt of wamth that you would hope for in a winter warmer. Drinkability is above average, as I could see myself drinking a number of these at a holiday gathering. Overall, a great start to my Winter Classics pack...although I am not looking forward to the Cranberry ""lambic"" based on the reviews I have read so far.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,beveragecaptain,3.4,"Pours a clear reddish brown with a small off-white head. Sweet, malty aroma. The flavor is malty with a decent amount of hops. I find this beer to be overly sweet.

Like most beers from Sam Adams, this beer is very drinkable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Backer2004,4.2,"Excellent choice to start the holidays, I could not get enough of this at a Christmas party last night.

Gorgeous curtains of fine bubbles- Perhaps this looked so good because I had just driven 240 miles...Nose is malt and gingerbread.  It tastes of sweet malts and spices, crackers and fruits, just enough hops to offset the sweetness. Some spiciness in the mix. Mouthfeel is moderate carbonation up front, then creamy, with nice finish. Very drinkable",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Gagnonsux,3.88,"Elements of the flavor of this beer remind of of Dixie Blackened Voodoo, I think that is because this beer has a molasses-like flavor. Appearance is amber-brown with average-sized, creamy head. Smell is treachy, nice and full. Taste is totally malty, with some taste of spices in the finish. Mouthfeel is a little creamy, which fits this beer nicely. This is an enjoyable beer, I like this more than the similar Blackened Voodoo, because this doesn't cloy.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Stingray5,4,"2004 release. Been a while since I've had this. Label has changed, but the beer is as I remember it. Pours reddish brown with an impressive off white head that falls to a sustantial ring, large bubbles. Sweet fruit aroma with some spices, a little peppery. Creamy mouthful. Sweet malt in the taste with that slight metallic twang I notice in a lot of Sammys. Finishes with a nice hop kick. Warming alcohol notes, a very nice winter lager. Solid all around.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,skybluewater,3.08,"Pours a dark amber color. Head disappears quickly, no lace. Very standard lager smell, nothing special here.

I'd return to it again, but only if I had to.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,soper2000,3.97,"From the Winter Sampler pack. Poured aggressively, it offers a 1 finger white head with ok staying power. Body is a burnt amber. Aroma is of sweet malt and spice (corriander?).

A decent beer which I seem to enjoy every winter.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,cncbofh,4.26,12oz bottle. Sampled tested at 50F.  Poured a deep rust color with a decent bubbly lace head. Very clear and crisp looking.  Smelled of christmas around the house. Pumpkin and ginger and cinnamon and Red Hots candy.  Malty cookie-like flavor - very complex and chewy. The wheat is well balanced with the hops and spices. Light on the palate and leaves a pleasant aftertaste. Dry Smooth finish.  Keeping me warm during a cold Colorado winter.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,mobyfann,3.88,"Paid only $10.99 for the ""Winter Classics Holiday 12 pack""  The beer poured exactly like the original Boston Lager, dark amber-brown base with a medium white head with good retention and a few signs of lacing. The aroma was a little faint but hints some malt, caramel and a touch of alcohol.  The taste is solid; light malt, light hop, light caramel, light alcohol, and a spicy touch. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth on the palette and no harshness at all. The drinkability is pretty high for a 7% lager so splitting a 6er for $6 with a friend around holiday time makes a great night.  Final Thought: It's a much stronger version of their Boston Lager in short, a solid seasonal...",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,lackenhauser,3.29,"Poured a very nice,deep copper color. A slight head that leaves a trace of lacing on down. Not much aroma-slightly toasted malt,maybe a hint of caramel. Malt flavor dominates. Quite crisp on the palate actually. Some residual sweetness. Dont get any of the ""winter spices"" the label speaks of. Decent body. A very drinkable beer but I dont think it would be the first thing I reach for in the way of ""winter beers"". I honestly think this and some of the other SA seasonals have been toned down over the years. This seems to become more lackluster with every year.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Hibernator,3.83,"I had this out of a 12 oz brown bottle and served it in a British imperial pint glass. Freshness date marked for March 2005.  Copper colored brew with a nice, fluffy head on top. The head quickly into a lace.  Pretty neutral aroma. Slightly metallic. I thought there would be some strong whiffs with a winter warmer. I smell some caramel and cookie scents.  A sweet flavored darker style lager. Caramel juices provide a sweeter taste, but the palate becomes dry and clean on the finish. Strong malt-centered backbone.  When I was younger this was one winter seasonal that I looked foward to seeing on the shelves. This is a solid choice and a great pick when in the boston area selection is rather limited.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,necoadam,3.68,"One of the better Sam Adam's seasonal I think.  Poured out a deep amber/ruby red color with a nice light tan head that stays with you the for whole ride.  Smell consisted of malts mostly with a good dose of fruits and some slight spices hang around in the background.  Taste was good. Hops and malts hit the palate softly with some wheat background. Then the fruit comes into play with some spices going towards the end. Good character in this brew.  Mouthfeel was good. Medium-ish body considering it's 7% almost. A nice option during the winter months. But I would of liked to see a little more spices. I remember last year's had a little bit more of a kick with the spices. But nevertheless, a good brew.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Aroma was very light, what was present was yeasty. Sedate caramel malts flavor, with slight hops character. Mouthfeel somewhat neutral, and drinkability good. Another more homogenized brew from Sam Adams to try and meet everyone's expectations, most likely overly impressing no one. Still not a bad brew, however, and a good choice from a limited tap menu...",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,dren,3.47,"Pours a mild reddish brown color with a foamy head that doesn't last long. Full of carbonation but little smell and flavor for what I have come to expect for a winter brew. There is a little taste of hopps along with lingering spice in the background but it is not overpowering. An easy beer to drink but not what I look for in a winter beer. It is easy to put away a few of these unlike other beers of the type which are more filling and strong tasting. Still not a bad beer, nothing really stands out and nothing really falters. Not bad to try but if you want that spicy harty winter beer look elsewhere.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,RushLimbmalt,4,"Pours a dark amber color and has little or no head and leaves no lace. The caramel malts dominate the aroma and mix in a interesting fashion with the wheat malts.

Definitely a drinkable winter beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,granger10,4.5,"Well, the pour was a dark copper red but the head was lacking a bit in size and seemed a little fizzy. The smell has some nice spice to it but was a little strong on the alcohol. That's about all the bad that I have to say about this beer. The taste had an amazing complexity. Caramel malty sweetness upfront followed by a roasted barley flavor that holds for the duration of the drink. The spices are perfect in amount and flavor. There seems to be a good amount of cinnamon, which I love, and ginger but they never get too strong and mix beautifully with the malts and hops, just perfect. Hops are spicy and have a European flavor to them. They seem to come with the spices but pick up towards the finish. Slightly belly warming on the way down, which is the intent of this beer right. Body is medium thick and holds the flavors really well. Very drinkable, but maybe after a few I might grow a little tired but I'm not sure, i guess i gotta try sometime soon to see.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,aquatonex,3.5,"Sam Adams has made another decent-quality beer with this one...  Pours translucent dark reddish-brown with moderate foamy head. I was expecting more spice in the nose, mostly was malts, a little hops, and alcohol. Taste was surprisingly unspiced, mainly malt and some fruity notes. However, despite its taste shortcomings, it is still a solid, consistent brew from Sam. I'd drink it again.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,claytri,3.71,"I was presented with a translucent amber pour that was topped with a fine rocky tan head. It had light malt aroma. The taste was a fine malty brew with quite a bit of fruitiness to it, and even a strong apricot and hop finish. The beer is medium bodied and oily. This is a nice beer and pleasantly sweet and fruity. I will definately be sampling more of this as it seems to be widely available at bars that normally don't have a decent beer on tap.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,allengarvin,3.91,"2004 12-ounce bottle, just arrived in the store this week.  Appearance: Clear mahogany color; frothy foam with good head retention.  Aroma: Sweet malt, with some crisp wheat notes.  Flavor/Body: Toasty malt, with developing sweetness in the middle. Wheat taste is small but still there. Hop bitterness is restrained, but enough to keep the beer from being cloying. Malty finish. Alcohol warms after the end. Carbonation is medium, body is a little more than medium.  One of the better of the Sam Adams main line of beers, this is a product I look forward to every year. They seem to have fixed the label, which used to read ""Winter Lager"" and underneath it ""A Dark Wheat Ale"". It's now simply ""Winter Brew"" [and underneath: ""A dark wheat malt liquor""], with no hint of whether it's an ale or lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Tang07,3.8,Yum.  SA Winter Lager pours a nice ruby brown with a nice thick tan head that sticks around for a while and laces the glass quite nicely.  The nose is very subdued. I had to really sniff to get a faint smell of malt and an even fainter smell of yeast.  It has a nice malty flavor with a hint of nutmeg and hop.  It has some nice body to it and it is very enjoyable now that the weather has cooled down.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Well balanced, with just enough mixture of hops an dmalt to make a pleasing, non-session beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,PorterLambic,3.38,"Poured a dark coppery color with a small head that reduced to a film. Smell was malty, with just a hint of some inditinct spice. Taste was better, light hoppiness, malt, faint spices - mostly in the aftertaste. A medium body, more like a wheat or thin brown ale than a lager, even a seasonal one. Quite drinkable, but would have liked the spices to have been more noticeable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,NeroFiddled,4.08,"This ""dark wheat lager"" pours a clear, deep amber body with a ruby cast. It's topped by a frothy head of ivory cream that holds exceptionally well and leaves some very nice lacing about the glass. The nose is malty and clean with a hint of hops and just a suggestion of the winter spices that are used. They do come out in the flavor, however, once the rich, wheaty and caramel-glazed maltiness subsides a little bit; and they stick around to linger in the aftertaste. A bit of cinnamon is discernable, and perhaps some nutmeg, but overall the spices are nicely restrained, lending more to balance than flavor. And it's really well-balanced with the spices working in tandem with the low-key bitterness to balance the malt and dry the finish. A slap of delicately spicy noble hop ties everything together throughout; and it's alternating sweet malt - spicy finish keeps it really drinkable. Nicely done! A very enjoyable ""winter"" ale that's quite welcome on my table at any time during the year.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

35,101,GreenWBush,3.52,"12 oz. 2004 sample. One month left on the ""best by"" date.  Sam Adams Winter Lager pours out a near maroon with a cascading head that meringued over the glass and onto my Bell's coaster. There lays an ivory 1/16"" froth visually akin to a true British ale (ironically). Impressive presentation. The lacing is truly impressive; one of the best i've seen in a while.  The nose is slightly stale. The yeast tones are overpowering as with most of BBC's products. The biscuitiness is strong with a whiff of alcohol and a smooth finish of pear. I always have felt that BBC's Sam Adams imagery has tricked my nose into smelling parchment ""Constitution"" aromas. The ghost of the patriot.  Talk about a rich mouthfeel! Amazingly chewy. The spicing is done perfectly; you taste it without tasting it. The spices themselves are unseen but the cloak of the alcohol is downright deceptive! I wasn't huge on its drinkability, i'd have one or two but no more.  Surprisingly damned good! I wish I would've bought more of this when it was still around. One of the first BBC brews i've really liked!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,watermelonman,3.31,"This poured to an almost dark red color with a medium head. It's leaving about average lacing as well.  The taste is well spiced, almost to the point of being overwhelming. However, it does do a good job of hiding the alcohol content.  This is a decent winter beer, but I don't find it to be all that exciting.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,taez555,3.97,"This beer poured a yellow/tan head with a clear reddish/brown body.  The nose was a beautiful mix of rich sweet dark malt and sugar. Almost reminiscent of a softer barleywine. It actually reminded me of a fresh early December new england snowfall.  The taste was a mix of rich malt, brown sugar, a slight hint of spice, mint, cinnamon, and caramel. Medium bodied with a slight graininess. Very smooth and rich. The bitterness takes a back seat to the malt but works perfectly in the mix.  Overall a great winter beer. Its basically a bigger beefier version of the boston lager. Sort of like what the Boston lager would taste like if it were a barleywine but without the alcohol content. Still a great winter session beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

I had originally intended to taste a new beer that was brewed near my location, but I was disappointed to discover that it was months beyond its expiration date.  not to be discouraged so easily, i popped open a bottle of Winter Lager from late 2003. I'm glad to say that I was pleasantly surprised. i was expecting a full-bodied beer with well-mannered flavor characteristics, but what i got was something even better.  Beyond good body, this beer's mouthfeel is all-around enjoyable. It settles in only when neccesary, and for the most part the brew just cruises over the tongue. Its flavors include oat and caramel over wheat and a semi-sweet hop bitterness. To be perfectly honest, i thought this beer smelled exactly like fresh-baked wheat bread. but then, i've suffered through a cold lately, so my sense of smell may be especially weak right now.  This beer pours amber-brown with a thick sand-colored head. The head itself thins, but remains at least a few millimeters thick until the last drop of beer is imbibed.

Nose: Very nice malt at fist. It is sweet all through out. It has a creamy nose as well.  Taste: Not too bitter at all. In fact, I didnt get much bitterness anywhere.

Muted coffee and burnt oak flavors, faint hops kick and a slight bitter aftertaste.  Mouthfeel was bland and a little syrupy.  This is a decent beer and highly drinkable but not what I expected in a winter lager. I expected much bolder flavors than this.

Appearance- This beer pours a nice light tan, two-finger head that is retained very nicely and clings to the side of the glass. Color is that of a classic Irish Red. Tiny bubbles flow quickly to the top of the beer throughout the drink. Crystal clear. A truly beautiful looking beer.  Smell- A strong bready maltiness, but almost no hop aroma.  Taste- Very smooth malt flavor with a smooth transition to a light hop bitterness. I cant really distinguish any of the winter spices except maybe a little nutmeg.

35,101,Jacobier10,4.45,"When poured, this beer has a deep amber color with a perfect amount of head. Very malty taste that gives it some bite and a little spice. Also, a slight amount of orange can be detected. The 6.94% ABV and rich flavor makes it perfect for sitting around on a cold winter night (which I am fairly used to in Boston).

Rich and very malty with a cognac sweetness; dark crystal malts and a touch of chocolate malt? As with other dark, rich, malty beers, the taste has nuttiness to it that reminds me of macadamias. The hop is pleasantly subtle but present, particularly in the aftertaste where the malt sugars could (but didn't) overwhelm.  A brandy beer to be used with good friends in deep conversation.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,ALESwhatCURESya,4.13,"This is exactly the way a winter lager should look. Beautiful rust color and fluffy tan head.

It is only the end of February and I am already dreading the soon-to-be disappearing winter brews like this one. This truly is one of my favorite from Sam Adams",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,CarolinaCardinals,4,This deep red amber lager left a nice lacing down the side of my pint. Smell a hint of cinamon and ginger amongst the caramel malts. This beer is not heavily hopped and has a nice caramel spiced malted finish. It has a nice mouthfeel to it as the malts weigh this brew nicely. This is quite more interesting than the Sam lager which is enjoyable in itself. It warms me up nicely on a cool desert winter night!,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,alexgash,3.5,"2003 Edition (if this even matters)  Pours a dark raspberry brown with a light tan head. Smells of fruity (grapes) wheat malt, with a faint hop backing (tettnanger?). Taste is spicy, fruity, with a crisp wheat feel. Light bitterness in the finish. Not bad, but it could be tastier (and better).",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,malty,4.18,"Served from a 12 oz. bottle with a best before Apr. ('04) notched-out.  Pours a brilliantly clear burnt copper color with a modest light beige head that stuck around a while. A stellar appearance!  Earthy malt nose with caramel, vanilla, toast and an interesting vegetal aroma.  A complex array spices; cinnamon, very faint nutmeg & pine with a great balance of prickly hop biterness hemmed-up with luscious roasted caramel malt with a woody-dry ending. Medium bodied with alcohol warmth in the finish.  Mouthfeel is soft and fluffy; attributes of the wheat malt used. Finely carbonated with a lively activity right to the finish.  Drinkability is high due to it's balanced flavors and inherent lager quafities, I mean 'qualities'.  I actually was pleasantly surprised with this beer. My expectations were exceeded by this sturdy and eventful lager. The spices were apparent, but never in your face. Hats-off to the brewers for crafting a beer with great balance and originality!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,BeefyMee,3.28,"Appearance: Transparent red. Small head.  Smell: A little bit of a pumpkin smell in the midst of a stronger cookie and spice aroma. There's also a trace of alcohol and cinnamon. Everything doesn't jive quite right.  Taste: That pumpkin aspect is still lingering about. The flavor would be much better if it wasn't so tangy.  Mouthfeel: Surprisingly thick but got worse as I drank.  Drinkability: Just as drinkable as most SA products.  Beef Notes: Not my favorite Sam or winter brew by a long shot. I had it on tap and it was better, but it's still a decent beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,UnionMade,3.26,"I had this on tap this evening at Red Lobster. The crab legs are very tasty. The beer arrives looking a reddish copper, topped with a sizable ivory head. The head dissipates into a thick film upon sitting a few minutes, keeping all the way through the pint. No lace, aside from some scattered blobs at the top. The aroma is strongly malty, with emphasis on caramel. A moderate buttery diacetyl presence with some indistinct spices. I really can't tell what's in there, but I'd bet on some cinnamon. Mild herbal hopping, a strange blend that suggest noble hops, but somehow earthy and muddy. The flavor starts with a robust caramel maltiness up front, moving into some spiciness and a light buttery flavor. Very wierd spicing, with definite cinnamon and something familiar that I can't put my finger on. Rather subdued and indistinct under the malt. Some earthy, nutty, herbal hopping enters into the finish, with an odd wheaty dryness right in the end. Wheat malt? Some alcohol is noticable, as well. A bit of spice lingers in the aftertaste, with caramel malt sticking around briefly before fading out. Fairly full bodied, with somewhat coarse carbonation and mouthfeel. Fairly clean, aside from the diacetyl. It could possibly be the lines. Maybe it's some spice I'm not familiar with. A very unusual beer, I'm not quite sure what style this could be. Spice, wheat malt, odd hops. Maybe some kind of wacko agressively hopped bock interpretation? Not bad, but this is easily my least favorite beer from Boston Beer Co. The flavors are sort of indistinct, with an odd roughness to the overall feel. I think the carbonation on all of Sam Adams' lagers is a bit too agressive. Good with dinner, but I didn't want another one.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,stirgy,3.61,"This is a beautifully clear beer. The color is like an amber copper with ruby red highlights. Creamy white head of foam. The aroma is creamy and buttery smooth, with the emphasis on butter. Taste is oily sweet, buttery crisp with their winter spices and flavorful. Not sure what spices are in this beer  Hard to distinguish. The body is medium sweet with a soft spicy finish. Interesting, flavorful.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Stimack,3.75,"The color is copper wit a big off white foamy head that stays for a good time dissipating to nice lacing that clings to the walls of the glass.

35,101,Shaw,3.85,"After having two disappointing brews from the Boston Beer Co. (Octoberfest and Old Fezziwig) I'm glad to say that Samuel Adams Winter Lager restores my faith in this brewery a bit.  This is a nice deep red lager with a pretty head that turns into a white ring around the edge of your glass as you drink it. It's got a nice malty smell that reminds me of a doublebock's aroma. No hop aroma.  The taste is nice and malty-sweet. Quite like a light doublebock. But the mouthfeel and body is not as heavy as a doublebock. I can't tell that there are any spices in the brew like the label says. From the taste I'd say this beer is driven past a pile of spices, rather than any actually being in the beer itself. But I'm not deducting points for that since the beer tastes good anyway. I'm no pro taster, Michael Jackson would probably tell me exactly which spices are in it after one sip.  For a winter seasonal from a (sorta) mass-producer of beer, Samuel Adams Winter Lager is a standout. And at its price level, this lager even more appealing.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,byrd,4.05,"I had this one on draft a couple years ago and havent had it since until just recently. I remember liking, so when I saw it this year, I decided to try in again.  Foamy slightly sticky light tan head that lasts a long time. Head does eventually diminish to a scattering on the surface and a ring around the edge of the glass. The brew is clear reddish-brown in color. Good bit of malt on the nose. Carmel notes are apparent. Spices are also noticeable  brown sugar, ginger, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Some light notes of dark fruits are also present. Hops are light, but noticeable. Nice start with malt, bread notes, and light flavor of dark fruits. Spices similar to the aroma come to the foreground next. Hop finish balances out the brew nicely, and lingers for a short period. Not being a huge lager fan to start with, I wasnt expecting much. This one doesnt blow the roof of the building, but its nice nonetheless, and is actually better then I was expecting from my memories.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,UncleJimbo,4.23,"12 oz brown glass bottle. Best Before End month notched on the label.  This lager poured a clear, deep red, chestnut color with creamy, tan foam that clung to the glass and left some lace. The smell was very niceand crisp and malty with aromas of biscuit. The taste was slightly sweet and malty with flavors of bread, some tangy hops, a bit of floral hops, a mild bitterness and a hint of spice. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with medium body and good carbonation. The finish was hoppy. This was a surprisingly good lager and was easy to drink. Kudos to Boston Beer Co. for this year's batch of this lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,kbub6f,3.78,"Big, light tan, fine, foamy head on top of a deep, reddish-copper body. Clumpy, sticky lacing. The aroma is very nutty and a little tangy. Roasty grains in the tangy front. The middle turns sourish with a little roasty chocolate. Smooth, but a little thin. Nuts! in the finish. More roasty grains and some dark, bitter chocolate. This is a nice, grainsy brown with a great, dry finish. I like it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,farHillsBrewer,4.12,"This maple syrup colored brew hits the nose with an ample malty aroma of warm bread. The mouthfeel is smooth and pleasant. There is a spicy flavor there but it rightly is too subtle for me to guess the spice. The wheat yields a nice bready flavor to go along with the substantial maltiness, Just enough hops for a little length om the tongue. I'd like another.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Boto,3.63,"It is a copper-brown color. Mild aroma. Hints of spices and malts. There is somewhat of a tan head. Smooth and creamy taste. This is good, but it still is very nondescript. I would never turn one down, but there is no compelling reason to buy it with beers like Sierra Nevada Celebration or Pyramid Snow Cap out there.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Rootdog316,3.95,"This beer was very...well, delectable. It had a moderate head and had a great taste, but somewhat of a strong aftertaste.

35,101,JackTheRipper,4.2,"Pours a nice coppery reddish color, pretty good head on it, lacing is decent. Light amount of carbonation seen. Very clear.  Smell: a bit spicy, with a light cinnamon smell predominating. Just a hint of clove.  Taste: Malty and a bit spicy, do I taste orange peel? Not a big up front alcohol presence, but now that I take a big whiff and then a sip, the alcohol is more noticeable~very nice. Finishes with a nicely moderate hoppiness.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation is good, the last beer I drank was a la fin du monde, so this is a welcome change. Not too dry, a bit of warming in the gullet.  Drinkabililty: Not the best winter variety I've had, but this is a darn good beer. Kudos, Mr. Koch. It's a pretty cold day in PA today and this is hitting the spot.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Zraly,4.3,"A beautiful reddish-brown brew with an off-white head. A nice cling during the drinking process and carbonation is appropriate for this style.  Smells of a few choice spices, namely cinnamon and clove; a combination that has a hard time being wrong.  The spicey smells carry over smoothly and gracefully into a complex, yet simply pleasant, flavor. This is a spiced libation that is subtle and accessible. The malts are richly caramel-like, with slight nuances of dark chocolate and earth. The sweetness is mellow and warming...like a good winter beverage should be. A tang finishes off the character and overall feel of the flavor. A really balanced and excellent offering from those folks in Boston. I've had this seasonal beer more often this winter than any other; a consistent and pleasing choice.  I'm having mine with a pepperoni pizza and I'm not complaining about the pairing, that's for certain. But, I was thinking a medium-heat curry chicken dish would go nice. Or perhaps Tandoori chicken.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Gavage,3.96,"Pours a clear auburn color with a 1 inch head. The aroma is spicy, most notibly nutmeg. The flavor is mild, but nice. Malt, nutmeg, cinnamon, and honey are most predominent. There is a bit of hoppiness to this beer.  The body is slightly thinner than expected. The spices ride the tongue for a short while after swallowing. This is easily drinkable, as this is one of the mellower winter beers out there. The flavor is not overwhelming but enjoyable, so several of these can be quaffed.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Dubblebock,4.25,"This winter offering from Sammy Adams really kind of snuck up on me this year. I had seen it a few times and passed on it because I got caught up in trying some of the more exotic winter and holiday brews. Now I kinda wished that I hadn't waited so long to pick this up. It's a most impressive and well-crafted beer. I picked up a sixer in San Marcos, Texas, for $6.99.  The winter lager comes in a nicely decorated bottle, labeled as malt liquor in Texas because of our ABV laws. The beer pours well, leaving a nice head behind, although not a particularly long lasting one. Good nose, spicy but not overwhelming.  The taste is exceptionally smooth for a spiced beer. The malts dominate the palate, and the spices don't disrupt the flavor at all. The Winter Lager bills itself as a dark wheat, and the bready wheat malts definitely declared themselves on the initial sampling. I was actually kind of awed by how well the spices were integrated in this beer. Hints of cinnamon and black pepper were detected as I worked my way through the glass. The hops were blended in particularly well, and added a slight bitterness on the back of the tongue.  Good mouthfeel, smooth finish. VERY drinkable, although the ABV might slow you down after you've had a couple. This beer is an excellent template for how a spiced beer should be brewed. Incredibly balanced and tasty, this one is a hands-down winner.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,HardTarget,3.91,"Notched month best by (Apr.) reviewed Jan. No year noted&#8230; hope I got this year&#8217;s batch. My bottle looks different than the picture; guess they changed the label. Aroma: Nice spiced malt nose with some yeasty notes. Appearance: Clear light amber with a big frothy head of light tan. It has great lacing with small tidemarks noting each sip. Flavor: Mild flavor. Very well balanced, no sweetness, no hop bitter, but the taste of malt and hops is present. A bit of the wheat malt comes in, and the spices really show off. I get hints of orange rind and maybe nutmeg or ginger? Mouthfeel: A bit thin and oily, with a lasting mouth coat. The beer has an overall creamy feel. Overall Impression: A great looking, good tasting beer. Overall a bit on the mild side. Nice spices, hides the alcohol well: good beer! Recommended.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,BuckeyeNation,3.83,"Burnished copper with orange highlights topped by a sticky tan head that lasts a while. Small chunks of lace adorn the sides of the pint glass as the foam recedes. The nose is slightly spicy and is somewhat earthy.  The flavor is predominantly malty, with no trace of hoppiness until the finish. Winter Lager is slightly sweet in the beginning and middle, then dries out a little on the back end. Also appreciated is a pleasant spiciness (cinnamon, nutmeg) that reminds me of the holidays. The mouthfeel is about right for a dark lager; maybe a little more full than most.  All in all, Winter Lager is an enjoyable winter beer (the label says that it's 'a dark wheat lager brewed with winter spices'). It's my first Sam Adams brew and I was pleasantly surprised. I can see myself buying this one again.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,marcobrau,3.8,"This is a good tasting amber colored lager beer that always seems to sneak up on me, if you know what I mean...it's a little stronger than your average lager. I usually get this in a Sam Adams Holiday Classics sampler pack that is often a gift. It's a fairly tasty winter brew. The almost wine-like malty aroma and spicy aroma is very pleasant. This beer is brewed with ""winter spices"" but I'm not sure which of these are present. I smell a bit of cardamom and perhaps a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg. I don't know that I can taste the spices, although there is peculier dryish character towards the finish that reminds me of nutmeg. The tawny malt flavors of this beer give it additional character. The finish is bit fruity yet fairly dry. One of the better winter beers, especially when fresh. Shouldn't be served too cold to appreciate it's character, even though it's a lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Redrover,3.88,"The beer as poured, was a nice reddish/brown/amber with a decent head & lacing.  The smell was of malt and a hint of different spices.  I liked this beer. The taste had more hops than the aroma led me to believe. The malts were also clearly present. Very soft & creamy beer. Seemed to have a bit of spice thrown in, but it may have been from the type of hops they used.  Very easy to drink and after the Old Feziwig, the best of the Sam Adams winter beers. Better on tap than in bottles, but either way it is good.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,beergeek279,3.68,"Served in the 12 oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The color is a dark amber, with a wisp of white head. The smell is a nice maltiness. The taste is a dark malt sweetness, with hints of spicing. Mouthfeel is average. Drinkability-wise, could definitely have a few.  Not a bad offering from Sam Adams. Though beer snobs might look down on Boston Beer, when they make a good beer, it should be applauded, and this is quite an interesting offering, and I'd probably have one next year.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,palma,3.68,"Appearance: Dark amber body with a thick yellowish head that lasts and lasts. Head leaves rings down the whole glass that really sticks.  Smell: Extremely spicy. Very bready. A little caramel and butter. The spice overwhelmes though.  Taste: Not as spicy as the aroma would lead you to believe. Sweet malt comes out immediately. A little hint of bread/grain in the middle. I also tasted pepper, specifically. Burnt caramel flavor throughout with a surrounding mild bitterness. A burnt aftertaste along with some lingering spicyness. A full bodied beer.  Mouthfeel: One of the better aspects of the beer. Very smooth. Light carbonation. Good density. Not watered down like some winter lagers. Great mouthfeel overall.  Drinkability: I think the spice can get to you with this one if you drink too many in a row. If you like Christmas spice, then this is a beer for you that you can drink all night long. In my opinion, if your only having a couple of em, then this is an easy drinking brew with good taste, low carbonation and great mouthfeel.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Ellbert,3.62,"This beer poured a red/orangish color with a huge fluffy off white head that took forever to settle down. The head was so fluffy and creamy that I could draw in it.  The smell was mildly spicy with a beefy sweetness. Subtle hops were noticable.  The taste was very mild with spices very discrete. A tasty brew but very low key, it could be kicked up a notch. This left you very dry afterwards.  The mouthfeel was meaty and chewy with just enough carbonation. Very nice.

The taste is decent. There is quite a lot of ginger used in this one. There are some crystal malts here giving it a malty taste. It's crisp and refreshing. The mouthfeel is good.

Aroma is caramel, toffee, small resiny hop note, some other X-mas like spice in the background that I can't quite make out. Taste is sweet malt with nice bitterings, ginger and peppery notes in the background. Very lively in the mouth with a slight alcohol kick on the back end.

35,101,GuinnessSmurf,3.44,"I tried this beer at both fridge cold and room temperature. Of the two choices, I have found that it tastes better when cold. When it pours into the glass, the head climbs up high to the rim with small to medium bubbles. In fact, I'd say the head was uncharacteristic of a typical lager. I really enjoyed the rich, bold color of this lager and could hardly wait to dive into it after a long night at work. The taste is very clean. There isn't a lot of extra spices in there, which is something I've come to expect from winter brews. In fact, I was looking for more of a holiday beer. What I got was a very drinkable lager. After taste fades quickly even with massive swishing. This sealed the deal: if you buy a Samuel Adams holiday beer, buy the Uncle Fezziwig.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,sulldaddy,3.38,"I had this brew poured in a pint glass very cold. The color was bright, clear amber, and there was a cm inch bright white head when the beer arrived at my table.  The aroma was dominated by floral hops and there were very faint traces of cinnamon. No caramel or other typical malt scents\  The first taste reveals a sharp fine carbonation and fairly thin mouthfeel. I notice a little malt sweetness but the brew is dominated by the hops. Not a very heavy flavor or rich for that matter. I actually was hoping for a little more spiciness in the brew, but I did find it very drinkable and could have had more than my two very easily.  The finish was short and clean withonly a faint hop bitterness left in my mouth.  I would drink this again if out and about and best choice on tap but not sure if I would buy any bottles for home consumption.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,RoyalT,3.6,"Appearance  The body of this lager is brown and very clear. The head frothed up quickly and laced the glass as it went down.  Smell  The grain here came out nicely, which is a welcome surprise from an American brewery. The cinnamon, allspice, and sharp clove where terrific, and the toasty malts created a solid backbone.  Taste  The grain reserved itself for the finish, giving me a joyful mouthful of heavily spiced beer. There were some good maple notes along with toffee and a hint of cocoa. The light herbal bitterness brought up the rear.  Mouthfeel  Thin but a little better than light-bodied with little carbonation. The body was a bit light in the ass for the big flavors in this beer.  Drinkability  This is a solid entry into the Winter Warmer style.  Comments: I didnt care at all for the 2003 offering, but the 2004 sample that I had was so above and beyond the 03 that I completely rewrote the review.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,counselor,3.09,"This beer poured a dark reddish brown and looked crisp with a 1"" head of nice white foam. The beer's aroma differed little from the regular lager. Similarly, it tasted much the same as the standard Boston Lager, as I have found all Sam's to taste pretty much the same (almost as if the same yeast being used in all the lagers infuse the Boston Beer siwht the same over all fruity esters). There were no real winter flavors to speak of, no clove, spice, nuts, etc,. I always expect that a winter beer will provide some different flavors, though unfortunately, this Sam's did not.  It was very crisp and refreshing, however, and was easy to drink - wouln't be a bad intro beer for a winter style, shich, I think Sams has really become just that .. a micro-craft intro beer.

Nose is sweet malt, fresh and pleasing to the senses with the start lightly sweet and decently malted, top is fair to middling in feel. Finish is modestly carbonated, the hops relatively unobtrusive in their spiciness, quite dry aftertaste, another of those benign beers that are just plain good to drink when youre not in the mood for a Bad Boy beer.

I needed to get use to the winter lager after having the ""light"" beers of the summer ale and the octoberfest, but after awhile the winter lager goes down smooth. I really enjoy the color of this beer and the taste. not too spiced like some of the other winter brews out there. Does have a stong kick(6.94%) and that is a good thing so as to warm you up on a cold winter's night. I can easily put these down...just a damn good beer! I don't find this beer too filling at all.

White head of about one finger of foam fades shortly to a spotty ring of foam around edge of glass. Aroma is very sweet and malty; a vaguely citric hop presence makes itself known in the middle of the nose as the beer warms. Spices, which are also vague in the aroma, are much more prominent in the flavor: slightly nutmeggy and clovey, with cinnamon gradually coming to the fore. This balances nicely with a sweet maltiness, and more citric hop that begins early in the palate and lasts. Mouthfeel is refreshing and sort of wet (because this is a ""wheat lager,"" according to the label?) with a slight tingle of carbonation. I'm not sure what food I'd match this with, but this ought to be a very solid session beer. Comfortable and easy-drinking.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

This one finally falls in between. I neither like it nor hate it. The aroma is immediately sweet and somewhat attractive. You can definitely smell the spice. It pours nicely with a off-white head to reveal a medium2dark amber color.

35,101,Foxman,3.33,"It pours a deep amber hue, with a pretty light tan head that lifts, then recedes slowly to a crepe of foam with the occasional denser islet within. The lace thins to spots on the side of the glass.  The first stage of the aroma is malt, followed by mild hops, with hints of sour cherry and maybe even berry of one sort or another.  The malt comes first as you taste, a slightly roasty sweetness followed by some hop bitterness on the tongue. There's a fleeting metallic tang that takes away slightly from the overall crisp flavor. However, while not deep in dimensions, it's pleasant.  It's lighter bodied than the color might lead you to believe at first blush. It doesn't coat the mouth so much as pass by, leaving a bitter tingle on the sides of the tongue.  Very good, and while not great, a fun stronger lager for the colder months. I sip it by the fire with She Who Much Be Obeyed when I'm of the mind to drink what she drinks. They flow easily and tastily. She looks forward to the fall release each year, and while I'm not quite as atwitter as she, I certainly don't dread it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,putnam,3.55,"Auspicious beginnings with a effluence of viscous, beige foam over reddish brown liquid. The aromas are deliciously malty. Nutty, baked plum fruit and cedar notes are most evident. In the mouth it is fluffy. Elements of lean, woody, hop tannins coexist with raw sugars, balancing out more-or-less dry. Some maraschino cherry and cranberry fruit prevails on the mid-palate together with sweet spice flavors.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,PatandDavid,3,"Not bad by any means, but not a holy grail or anything either...Color when served was clear Irish Setter red, no head to speak of. Aroma was malty.

35,101,BierManVA,3.61,"Pours a very dark red-amber with nice head that disappears rather quickly. I don't perceive too much aroma however which is strange, the bottle says ""brewed with winter spices"", (whatever they are) but I can't detect them. Perhaps my nose is stuffed up.  The tatse is quite similar to Sam's regular lager in my opinion. Perhaps a bit fuller.  Nothing over the top with this brew, but if you enjoy Sam Adams usually, you will enjoy this one.

35,101,BigPapaLager,3.43,"This is a brew I usually look forward too every year, as it was one of my first winter beers. Pours a crystal copper color with a medium head. Lacing was not significant. A sweet one with some hop bitterness as well. Drinkabilility is good but not one of Sammy's best IMO. Though it did get easier to drink as the night progressed.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

One can tell from the smell that this is a sweet, spicey one. The taste, however, is even sweeter and spicier than the smell seems to indicate. Not a lot of carbonation in this one, which makes it easy to drink. I feel confident that I could knock out quite a few of these lovelies with little trouble. I'll certainly be buying more of this.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Slight hop bitterness, and an orange flavor amoungst other fruit, carmelized sugar, maple syrup and some spices. Medium feel and very easy drinking - very smooth, no overpowering alcohol sense. Might be the best easily available winter beer out there. Drink it in the same session as Old Fezziwig and you won't like it as much, seems like a weaker version. It's preferable on it's own.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

35,101,Boilermaker88,3.75,"Released from its 12oz brown bottle, Sam Adams Winter Lager poured a clear brown color with a foamy ¾"" off-white head that slowly dwindled to a bubbly little cap. Some minor amounts of bubbles were noted slowly creeping up the side of the glass. This brew certainly has its sweet side. Aromas of caramel, vanilla, hints of dark dried fruits, and just a little nutty scent. The taste was a mirror to the smell, except the vanilla lessened and a citrus hops bite came out in the form of a mild orange peel flavor. Some mild spiciness was picked up on in the finish. The feel was medium-bodied and smooth. Winter Lager has an easy drinkability and a pleasant malty flavor. It's a nice brew for a quiet winter's night.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Taste is just like the smell but with some hop bitterness that hits last. Fairly well balanced. Finishes a bit heavy and dry. Good drinkability. A good brew, but could be better.

Upon the first sip, I didn't really find it all that engaging. Maybe I expected too much from this contract brewer, but Winter Lager's presence still seems a little onerous. It's got a great appearance and a heavenly smell, but once it hits the tongue, it's sticky and hollowly bitter.

The coloring of this one is great - perhaps because of the clarity. Aroma is sweet with caramel, some orange peel. Slightly alcoholic, with just a hint of wintery spices. This beer is extremely smooth. Medium to full-bodied. Starts a little on the spicey side, and then moves to the sweetness and ends with a slight bit of hops. Really nice warming effect from this beer. The drinkability suffers on this one only because it is so unexpectedly strong.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

35,101,Beastdog75,3.24,"(Samuel Adams ""Winter Classics"" pack, 2003)  Samuel Adams Winter Lager is a dark wheat lager brewed with some ""winter spices."" All in all, it is a pretty drinkable brew for the winter months. It is brewed to be very drinkable, therefore there is nothing really overwhelming about this beer and it won't scare away your average beer drinker.  This beer pours a very nice ruby reddish color with some orange hue to it. A nice, light tan foam head forms and begins to dissipate in under 2 minutes, but leaves some decent lacing. The smell was a little dissapointing, as all I detected was a very slight malt aroma and some extremely light spiciness. The mouthfeel was a little on the thin side and was only lightly carbonated which suits this brew quite well. This has a nice flavor to it, although it wasn't as strong as I would have liked it to have been. Slightly on the sweet side, as the caramel-like malt really pops out at you every few sips. There are some regular malty flavors here, and some spices are present but certainly not overdone (if anything, underdone). It's hard for me to name any specific spices here, but ginger came to mind, and maybe even some orange/citrus peel-like flavors. There is a moderate hop bitterness in the finish. In the aftertaste, there are some cracker-like and toasted notes along with some dryness. It all finishes out with some alcoholic warmth.  This beer supposedly nears the 7% abv range, but it really doesn't seem all that strong to me. I only had one of these out of the sampler (my brother had the other one), so maybe a six-pack of this brew would help me distinguish more characteristics here. For a lager, it is more complex than your average dark brew, but this one would be even better if it were a bit more assertive in the aroma and flavor department.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

The beer is a very pretty dark amber color and looks great when held up to a light. The smell is very malty with hints of cinnamon and some other spices. The taste, unlike the Old Fez, is a much more balanced beer with less emphasis on the spice and more emphasis on the balance. There are many different layers of this beer, from the cinnamon flavors to the hint of orange this is a very complex brew.

Smell is more sweet then spicy, the spice seems citric like cinnamon and nutmeg mixed with pepper and orange peels, malty sweetness subdued overall with a burnt-like caramel. Not all that strong but interesting. Taste is all over the place, layers of different spicyness, including dried peppers, cinnamon, curried apples, orange peels, did someone mix the fruit salad with the salsa? Some malty sweetness of caramel lingers in the back trying desparately to keep things in check but lets go in quite a few areas. A mild but wild ride, nothing really stands out or is overwhelming. Feel is lighter then medium with a texture that didn't fit in the carbonation for me. Seems creamy, but the smoothness is all but lost due to the carb bite it tends to have mixed with the spices. Not something I'd have again really, but wouldn't turn it down if offered.

The head seemed to last about a minute or two before receding to the sides of the glass for the remainder. The smell is very malty with a hint of cinnamon and orange/citrus. The first thing I noticed with my first taste was the explosion on my tongue. Sensory overload, courtesy of carbonation.

A nice malty, yeasty, bready aroma that increased with warmth. Full mouthfeel and a creamy sense. Alcohol noted in the flavor.

A rich cornucopia of fruits and spice. On the palate, we feel a warm rush of hops, and the thick, luscious malt shows up immediately. Very pleasant recurring finish, notes of fruit, spice, and nuts return again and again. A little thin in body, but then, it's plenty full for a lager.

35,101,Quaffer,3.92,"The label states, ""A dark wheat lager brewed with winter spices.""  Appearance: This was a slightly hazey, amber-red beer. The cream colored head rose up to two fingers and settled back down quickly. It ended up as a thin layer of fine, dense foam floating over the top of the brew. Lacing was non-existent. I wouldn't think of rating an ale that looked like this above average. But considering it was a lager, it looked pretty good.  Smell: There was a very mild, clean aroma of caramel, cream, and sweet chocolate. I could not detect any of the ""winter spices"" touted on the label.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and creamy upfront, with a heavy carbonation as it slides into the back of the mouth.  Taste:The flavor consisted mainly of chewy roasted malt combined with a good dose of ginger. There was a floral hops bitterness on the finish that balanced this brew out nicely. There were some other spice flavors that flitted about on my tongue, but they were so fleeting that I just couldn't put my finger on any of them.

Actually a bit off-putingly tart, leaning toward sour. Switches to a husky, psuedo-wheat flavor. Spicing pales compared to what the nose offers, but brings forth ginger and cinnamon. Tiny bits of German hops close this out. Rather simple. Relatively thick, and smooth given the heft.

35,101,Mitchster,2.98,"Brewed with cinnamon, ginger, orange peel, 2-row pale, caramel 60, Wheat malt, and Munich malts. Hopped with East Kent Goldings, Tettnenger, and Hallertauer.  5.8% ABV, OG=1.0164, 200 cal/12 oz.  Brilliantly clear dark amber with ruby highlights, forming a 2-finger tall beige head atop medium bubbles with medium carbonation. Retention is average and lacing is sparse. Aroma is similar to an Oktoberfest, with a clean fermentation, amber malts, and subdued hops, yet there is a hint of a wheat bock character in there too. I don't pick up any obvious spices in the nose. Mouthfeel is initially bright and lightly acidic, with a medium body. Starts with a medium brisk fizz with mild German Noble hop spiciness, fading into a nutty, toasty amber wheat malt profile, a light metallic off-note, a black pepper character, very faint nutmeg ruddiness, and ending in a semi-astringent metallic note with some thin malts, black dirt, orange peel, and rubbery hops. Despite not being able to taste the spices, I know they are in there because of the ruddy finish and queezy feeling in my stomach. I am feeling the alcohol in this one, though it's well disguised in flavor. Everybody is mentioning ginger and cinnamon in here, so I went to the cupboard and refreshed my memory...I still don't pick up on these at all.

A good amount of lace clung nicely to the glass for the whole pint. Caramel, hops, and malt were the three strongest smells. The taste was nicely spiced and sweet with just a touch of hops.

The place I was in was a little smokey, and I'd had a few already, but there wasn't really much noticeable aroma -- a little bit of a sweet scent but nothing dramatic by any means -- pretty much par for the course for a lager without much head I suppose. It tasted fine but *felt* watered down -- not much body to it, certainly not very full at all.

Smooth, slightly sweet malt flavors dominate and include caramel and a hint of chocolate. Spice and alcohol flavors really compliment this beer well. Hops strike a wonderful balance in this one, keeping the malt in the forefront, but not overly so. Slight bitterness at the back end. Finishes well, with a slight lingering sweet flavor that leaves you longing for more. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Good drinkability, although some feel the spices are a little overboard. I find them quite to my liking. This is by far my favorite Sam Adams offering and one I will look for every year. Overall, a very good wintertime lager.

It started out very bitter in the first few sips, but then mellowed out to something more enjoyable. The appearance was very nice too.

Just hoping to get a good aroma release, I was not disappointed with the caramel and spices and a bit of citrusy hops before the head quickly melted away.  Color is a reddish iced-tea color, with bubbles quickly forming on the bottom and sides of the glass.  The solid carbonation gives it a crisp edge, but the good caramel malt character keeps it in check. It is not overly sweet and the following hop component is light enough to offend only the most inexperienced palate.  Good balance and full bodied without being heavy. Enough flavor to endure all evening.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,OldFrothingSlosh,4.07,"It was with some trepidation that I tried this beer from the sampler pack, given my lack of enthusiasm about the Old Fezziwg offering. Still, being the devoted beer quaffer that I am, I presed on. I'm glad I did.  Poured an intense copper color with a creamy, tiny-bubbled head that laced nicely.  Wonderful Christmas holiday smells are evident with this beer (most notably cinnamon).  I was surprised that the rather intense aromas didn't carry over into the falvor, but I think this is a good thing. The combination of everything working together in this beer (alcohol, spices, carbonation, medium hop influence and some malty sweetness floating around in the background) really make for a tasty beer.  Finished with the spicy character lingering for a while and combined nicely with the ""warm, fuzzy feeling"" from the alcohol. A perfect beer for the season.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,SchmichaelJ,3.95,"Impressed with Boston Beer Co.'s overall lineup, I was excited to try this, my first Sam Adams seasonal. It poured an amber, mahogany color. A small head with good retention, active carbonation and tight lacing rounded out the beer's appearance. A sweet malt odor dominated the smell, accompanied by a hint of hops and indeterminate spices. The same malt presence was evident in the taste, along with the complementary hops and spices. It actually tasted like the Boston Lager loaded with choice spice and maybe a little more hop presence. The medium body fit the lager style and made for a decent mouthfeel. All around, this was a very enjoyable winter lager, and an excellent representative of the Sam Adams line.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,garymuchow,4.3,"This is really quite a good beer. The best winter lager I've sampled. Nice amber color, clear with beige brown head that is very steady. Aroma is dark, rich, sweet malt that is close to molasses, and pushing cloyingly sweet, but, fortunately doesn't get there. Superb. Taste is a very rich sweet lager with dark roast flavor. Despite the richness one is able to take big drinks and enjoy a full flavor without being overwhelmed. Not necessarily a sipping beer. Spices are subtle. Medium fullness and carbonation feel without excessiveness. Overall a very nice winter brew. Even warms up very well for a lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,CharlesRiver,3.8,"Light amber in color with a small white head. The smell is malty and sweet with hints of something fruity. Doesn't seem to be overly carbonated which is one of the things I hate. The taste is similar to the smell but the fruit is much more pronounced in the end. A slight bitterness comes through in the end as well.  Seems like when I am out at a bar and they don't have much to offer I can usually fall back on this one. During the winter months, that is.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,mzwolinski,3.32,"Described on the label as ""rich, hearty and dark,"" this beer is, as one would expect, a bit underwhelming given its big-label origins. Nevertheless it is a not unsatisfying experience. Clear amber in color with a thin bubbly head. The aroma is sweet and sugary with something of a gingerbread character. The flavor is mildly fruity with a citric hop taste, with lots of malty sweetness and a understated (perhaps too understated) spicy character. Dry finish with a slightly sweet aftertaste, and a medium body. Heavier than the typical Sam Adams product, but a bit light on the warming effect, and not enough body to feel very _substantial_.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,MaineBeerMan,4.33,"Nice looking beer, deep red-brown and quite clear with abou a 1"" head of beige foam that fades to a sticky collar that leaves rings of lace. Aroma is full of malt caramel and spices, notably cinnamon, a fairly full aroma at that. Slick smooth mouthfeel with a great flavor of toasty sweet malt and just a hint of the spices noted in the aroma. A bit of herbal hop flavor makes an appearance about midway through and lingers on a nice long finish. A very tasty Winter offering from Sam Adams, I'll be sure to have a few more of these before Winter ends and they dissappear.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,RonfromJersey,4.2,"Ruby red body topped by a big off-white foamy head of micro bubbles. Aroma is a lively blend of spices, including nutmeg and cloves, caramel and wheat malt, and perhaps some floral hops. Taste seems to indicate that the spices have been scaled back this year, to me a very good thing. The various malts roll in and down the throat, living the spices to battle it out with the hops in the aftertaste. I believe it's the best batch in several seasons for this beer, and I am quite pleased. Take the spices out altogether next year, and I'll be down right euphoric.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,jward,3.66,"With a lovely ruby body and a fluffly tan head, this seasonal offering begins with an impressive appearance. A delicate nose suggests orange peel and malted wheat. On the palate, the sweet malt flavors are restrained by the hops blend and holiday spices (namely, the cinnamon, as I don't really detect the ginger that is also supposedly there). The spices are, however, quite subtle, and never really threaten to overpower the flavors of the more traditional ingredients. This spiciness resides at the back of the palate during a long and pleasant aftertaste that compliments nicely the 'warming' effect of the 6.9% ABV.  In general, I'm not a huge fan of spice beer, even during the holidays, but this one seems to be well-balanced, subtle and successful.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Suds,4.03,"This year's Winter Lager seems to be better than last year's. It's a spectacularly attractive beer. Thick, sticky head on top of a deep, dark, brown brew. Aroma is malty and spicy. There's a bit of citrus, maybe cinnamon, and a few fleeting smells that are hard to nail down. Supposedly a wheat lager, but I had trouble picking out the wheat tastes. Instead, there's countless layered flavors....sweet-ish and occasionally peppery....good hop balance. They've done a good job with his one: its interesting, drinkable, and available everywhere at this time of year.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,QXSTER1,3.74,"Beautiful in the glass. A rich amber with ruby highlights. Pours a decent, dense, quiet head with good retention. A bit spicy in the nose but not very aromatic. The taste is par for the course for a holiday brew. A bit of molasses and plums along with some subtle spices. Seems to be an attempt at a craft brew for the mainstream masses. Not bad at all, but the mass marketing of Sam Adams may affect my attitude.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,elmocoso,4.05,"Nice beer, with a great color. dark copper.. Great mouthfeel, kind of sweetly ritch and malty. Seems very well balanced.

35,101,oelergud,4.15,"Appearance: Dark amber to a light ruby in color, the head is good but does not stay as long as I would have liked. I havent tried this beer served cold as I prefer it just slightly chilled, maybe that would improve the lace as I don't get much with this beer. Smell : The smell carries spices with it that promises great taste Taste : A great tasting beer! the alcohol is noticeable but combined with the spices, of which I can only detect the ginger, it helps giving the beer a warm and cozy feel to it. This is a great christmas beer and I will definitely be drinking my fair share of it this year. As I understand this is a seasonal beer that ends in Feb. so be sure to stock up. Mouthfeel : Slightly thick and leaving a smooth feel on your tongue and on the roof of your mouth. Drinkability : This is a beer I will not get tired of, it smells and taste great and although still a novice in the way of beer tasting I think this is one of the best winter beers out there  Oelergud - Cheers!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,budgood1,4.36,"a re-review. clear deep amber color. huge off-white colored head that holds. lots of nice lace makes for a overall pretty looking brew. nice malty aroma, earthy hoppiness and spice. extreme creaminess makes for an amazing mouthfeel for a high ABV winter brew. rich maltiness balances well with slight spicy flavors (orange, chocolate and nutmeg come to mind). a slight spicy hop finish. all this goodness totally masks the 7% ABV. i was looking forward to re-reviewing this brew, thinking my first review was poor and my scores probably too high. well my first review WAS poor but i didn't ratchet down my lofty numbers a bit. an exceptional lager!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,aracauna,3.81,"Nice big stiff creamy head over really dark amber body with golden highlights. The smell is little more than light sweet caramel malt.

35,101,BeerBuilder,3.75,"Pours to an amber color with an off-white heat that quickly dissipates. The aromas are full of spices. Could be ginger and/or cinnamon. The roast malt aroma was also noted. The flavor was rich, with roasted malt, a hint of chocolate, and the mentioned spices. The hop bitterness was minimal. Overall, it was light-bodied, and smooth; a very drinkable beer.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,bmills1608,3.83,"Reddish amber color, with a thick creamy head, nice lace on the sides of the glass and keeps a thin film of froth all the way till the last mouth full.  Smell is wheat for sure, had the bottle not said ""Dark brewed wheat"" right on it, I would not have made the connection, but in smelling it after reading the label, to me, it does smell like wheat, like a sweet dark bread perhaps.  Taste is rich, creamy, malty, wheaty with a touch of prune/raisens etc and baking spices. Hop bitterness is kept fairly low, but are not absent. A bit sweet overall, but not even close to being over the top. The alcohol is completely hidden in the flavor. A really nice rich winter amber beer. I had one of these at Valley Forge park (on the sly of course) after walking my dog, looking out at the river when it was wicked cold out. Quite nice. Its hard to beat a hearty beer like this when you're freezing you ass off and loving every minute of it.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,ADR,4.1,"Clear dark amber with a yellowish sturdy head of cottony foam. Laces in rings. A little caramel and spice in the aromatic profile. Creamy malt impression, tinged with a bit of allspice and maybe a touch of subtle molasses. Good hop balance, somes sense of candied citron rind and other slightly astringent flavors. This is a sturdy and flavorful Winter beer to my tastes, not overblown in concept or marketing, just well-crafted and pleasant in flavor. Judicious use of spices and high drinkability due to its medium body and creamy qualities. The best beer in the variety pack and one I would purchase again.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,IrishRedRock,3.8,"Not all that complex, but I do like it. Reddish amber with a foamy head that quickly died down to nearly nothing. I am not picking up much spice in the aroma, but am picking up some roasted malts, alcohol, and some hops in the back. Mouthfeel is not quite smooth, with some carbonated bubbles, and the alcohol warms the back of the throat. I like the higher octane of this brew, and it isnt overpoweringly alcoholic in taste, but I think it might be taking over some of the flavor where some hops or spice flavor should be. All in all not a bad Winter seasonal, but not even close to some of the others I have tried this season.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,psugrad98,3.8,"Copper colored with small head, nice lace. Spicy aroma with hint of bitterness. Tastes slightly hoppy bitter with enveloping mouthfeel.

35,101,Mark,4.05,"I don't drink too much lager anymore but I have always been curious about this one. Deep amber appearance and decent head retention. Lacing was pretty good with some nice ring like shapes. I didn't detect too much in the way of spices but then I didn't care. I really do not prefer overdone spicing. Mouthfeel was a little thin but the smooth taste and excellent drinkabilty, made this a brew I probably will try again.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,mjohn27603,4.11,Sits in the glass with a copper color and one finger high head. Smell is sweet caramel and malty. When I sip it I notice a metallic taste with some caramel. There is a sour aftertaste that reminds me of macroswill. A very slight bitterness. This one has me scratching my head. The bottle is marked best before Feb. but no year is marked. Is it possible the store has put out last year's stock? I must be missing something because I'm getting no spice taste at all. I was very disappointed. I spent $15 for the variety pack and the first one out of the box is a dud. It was not refrigerated at the store.  Re-review: I got a fresh bottle and what a difference. It looks pretty in the glass with the head forming out of a gradually rising level of beer. I don't quite the spicy aroma as others. The taste on a fresh bottle is a full point higher (3.5-&gt;4.5). Orange peels the dominant flavor. Very slight bitterness and a caramel aftertaste. No metallic taste or sourness. Make sure you get the the fresh Winter Classic packs - 2002 has the Sam Adams Light.

35,101,johnrobe,3.9,"2002 version. You can sort of think of Winter Lager as Old Fezziwig Light. It pours a dark reddish brown in the glass and maintains a thin off-white head. It has a nice malty aroma with a hint of caramel. The taste is all malt with a slight citrus quality in the dry finish. The ""winter spices"" are pretty muted.

Sweet aroma consisted of malt, spice, caramel and a pleasant fruit scent. Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Midtones had a light orange peel taste to it. Spices are in there too, and add to the complex flavor of the beer. Malt finish with a slight caramel sweetness. An enjoyable, heart warming and complex winter lager.

The head died down rather slowly in my glass, and the smell of this lager was very malty and heavy. The mouthfeel of this lager was thick and rich and the flavour was good, but not too complex. This tasted to me to be more of a light brown ale, than a dark lager, or seasonal beer. But that is just one BAs humle opinion. Still this is quite drinkable and good to have around. but there are many better winter beers out there.  2003 Edition: as with the OF, this years versions are better than last years, so stock up!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Nose was a bit malty with a hint of ginger, but I was disappointed with the taste. While it was malty, with a hint of spices, it seemed purposely understated, leaving a watery, aluminum feel to the finish. Not a hint of alcohol for a moderately big beer, which could be considered a plus by some.

Pours one of the prettiest heads I have yet to see in my beer drinking career. It holds that head fairly well and leaves a heavy lace through the glass. Carbonation is lots of big thick bubbles, leaving the drinker with a tingly feeling on their palate. The body is medium/heavy, not really heavy but does have a substance to it. This adds to its awesome mouthfeel. Has a spicy cimmanon with a touch of cinnimanon scent to it; it is all in the tip of the nose. Flavor is close to the same, sort of an apple/cinnimanon/various other spice tastes (im not good enough yet to recognize them yet though im trying).

Smell is big on the spices -- I sensed orange peel and other citrus, ginger and some hops. Taste was more of the same, with the central focus on spiciness. Notes of citrus were definitely detected here along with some maltiness. Mouthfeel was relatively smooth for a spice beer, and for a lager of nearly 7% ABV, this is one easy drinker.

Smell: Quite clean for the boasted spices. Musty ginger, orange, faint cinnamon.  Taste: A bit thick, chewy, slick, smooth and malty upfront, with a quick, crisp, carbonation interruption ... smoothing back into a malty / spiced character of caramel, burnt sugar, bold and zesty ginger, cinnamon, toasted malts, sweet orange, orange peel, touch of chocolate, grainy, earthy and a hint of dates. Flash of hop bitterness peaking with the orange/citrus flavours. An alcohol presence/spice helps to round of the flavours, providing balance and a small, but ample, kick. Hop bitterness, overall, is mild and nicely blended with bit of a raw leafy feel that scrubs the palate nearer the end. Finish is dry, a tad grainy with metallic notes.  Notes: Spices are quite distinct, bold and adds another level of complexity to this brew, but without being overwhelming or artificial. Also has a nice warming effect that tends to sneak up on you.

35,101,hyuga,4.47,"2002 edition. A dark amber brew with an off-white head. Head settles and leaves lace, but stays at about 1 cm, which is good enough for me. Sweet spiced aroma of caramel and ginger along with wheat and faint orange peel and hops. The spices combine with the sweetness really well and make the aroma great. Wheat dominates the flavor, making it crisp and refreshing, but alongside that is a caramel sweetness that lets you know that this is more than just a wheat beer. Cinnamon, ginger, and orange peel give a great wintery feel in the spice department. Earthy character from the wheat and the hop bite near the middle. Crisp wheat finish. Alcohol warms, again making this a great cold weather brew. A great beer to sit back with on a winter's night for a nightcap, or to pair with hearty foods at a winter feast. This review is based on my total experience from this beer, not just the sample from this year that I'm currently drinking. It does seem that this year's is not as rich as it has been in the past. However, I do still find it very enjoyable.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

Nice flavor combination as well, not overly spicy, more subtle on the flavors, maybe a bit lacking flavorwise. Rich creamy thickness, full bodied, coates the tongues and lingers, which is fine for a winter spice beer. I remember the Winter 2000-01 version being more flavorful, and noticably better on tap, which I had only once. Ed's Note: From my Christmas '01 Boston trip.  Note: My taste bud's have matured and my beer exploration has expanded so much, that this beer is now merely average. This year, it seemed thin, watery and not flavorful at all. Some blend of spices, but overall mostly stale nutmeg and sourness dominate this one. Spices linger. Not nearly as good as the Shipyard Winter ale, which really the only one I have to compare it too.

The strong Hallertauer hop nose is followed by quite subtle and non descript spices. Perhaps orange zest and nutmeg? Moderate body and very slick mouthfeel. It almost has that ""oily"" mouthfeel that the Boston Lager has. The refined Hallertauer Mittelfruh hop flavor is quite high, but the hop bitterness is mild and thus imparts a significant sweetness to the brew. Lots of caramelized sugars in flavor, perhaps from the prodigious use of crystal malt. Mild nutmeg is present in flavor as well. Winter Lager finishes sweet w/ lingering crystal malt sweentess. Overall it's a very flavorful brew, but the sweetness borderlines on being cloying and thus hurts the drinkability.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81

I prefer a bit heavier brew in the winter, but on those occasions when I want something a bit lighter, this will do just fine.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Bighuge,3.11,This is a pretty average beer in my opinion. I definately like their other winter offering a lot better. Old Fezziwig. This beer just doesn't have anything that really stands out to me. Wheat malt taste present with very slight hop bitterness.,Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,frank4sail,3.8,"Amber, almost cranberry color. Sweet/Spice nose with hints of alcohol. Average head retention. Spicy with a slightly bitter finish. Overall, an above average dark lager.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,BeerAngel,4.62,"One of the best winter brews available IMHO. It pours a clear tea color with a nice off-white head. The smell of malt, light wheat, and spices smell delicious! The spiciness is just right with flavors of a light roasted malt, faint wheat, and a hint of spices.Very smooth, very balanced with the right amount of hops, and very drinkable! I will have this beer in my refrigerator every season. Cheers!  Note: It is not called Winter Lager here in Texas. Texas Law says that beer over 5% is an ale, but since this is a lagered beer, BBC labels the Texas version Winter Brew on the bottle even though the six pack holder still says ""Winter Lager"". Some more of Texas' own wacky beer laws!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,jackndan,4.45,"Sammy Winter 2002: I used to be a summer guy, never skied or liked shoveling snow. But Im coming around to the fall and winter, and great beers have helped that transition. It always helps to ease the pain to look forward to great O-fest and festival beers. One beer, in fact the first beer I looked forward to, was Sams Winter lager.  Ive heard people say that Sams seasonals have been slightly off, but I think Sams getting back into their stride with the 2002/03 Winter (not that youll see much of it after January 1). Its got a deep ruby amber color, with an off white sticky head. Huge thick lace. The aroma is heavily malted, with spices and rich coffees. The taste, in this fresh batch is a little raw, with assertive malts, well balanced with spices and hops. This is a big/fast seller, and hard to get in Winter. Ive got to buy an extra twelve and forget about it because it should cellar very well. Wonderful!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,rastaman,4.3,"i really liked this beer, had a really well rounded flavour, tasty to boot aswell, shame we don't get it round here.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,ZAP,3.86,"Another good one from ""Sammy""...I like ""Old fezz"" better but this is good in its own right..Light reddish copper appearance with a decent head...aroma is sweetish, but not as strong as ""Old Fezz""...tastes a bit like a Bock..but it says it is a wheat lager on the bottle...very easy drinking and tasty...an excellent winter beer.Not a real hoppy beer..definitely more on the malty side, and it really doesn't taste much like wheat to me..",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Jordan,4.3,"Spice and sweet caramel aromas. Head is sticky and endures. Beautiful red copper color, clear. Great malty sweetness offset by a unmistakable hops presense, also a hint of spice. Absolute delightful mouthfeel, silky smooth. Also very highly drinkable and worthy being termed a 'Winter' brew. Almost 7%abv this one makes a cold night toasty warm.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,proc,3.7,"This reminds me alot of Boston Lager with a little more oomph. A nice winter offering, slightly spicy, but just slightly with a nice taste of malt througout. Good stuff.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,Brent,3.16,"A dark wheat? Really didn't strike me as having a lot of wheat characteristics. I also didn't detect much spicing in the brew. It has a nice, sturdy malt body with a mildly fruity undercurrent. Pleasant, but not a lot of zip for a seasonal.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,xXTequila,4.43,"This years Winter Lager is practically another style of beer compared to last years batch. Deep dark red/brown. The head sits thin but height wise but its thick like a chunk of heavy cream. Thick sweet malt, rum, caramel, and raisins. The perfect beer for a snowy night.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,AaronRed,4.1,"A full lager. Smelled like a winter brew with all the spices wafting out of the glass. Very malty with a touch hops at the end. It took me a while to drink this beer, not because I did not like it, but because of it's rich flavor.",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
35,101,ThreePistols,4.6,"Dark amber color with decent head and lace. Roasted malt, caramel, chocolate, spicy aroma and taste with a dry hoppy finish. I stock up on it when it becomes available for the holiday since it is a seasonal beer. Happy Holidays... Cheers   11/2002 &#8211; I am not changing my review but rather to say... it&#8217;s the season again; Sam Adams&#8217; Winter Classics 12 pack is on the shelves again. It does my soul good to enjoy SA Winter Lager. This year's SA Winter Lager seems better than last year, which is a very good thing, or I'm more capable to appreciate this &#8220;classic&#8221; winter brew. Which ever the case may be, SA Winter Lager is one great beer.  Happy Holidays Prosit!",Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),"Massachusetts, United States",Bock,81
