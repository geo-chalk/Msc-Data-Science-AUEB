345,1005,TurboMon_911,4.38,Poured a semi-lucid copper color from a 12 oz. bottle (Best by Feb. 15 23) into a standard pint glass with a creamy barley colored finger high head that clings to the glass as it recedes. Aroma is mainly malty with overtones of cereal grain and grapefruit. Taste is bitter throughout but very well balanced with the malty sweetness and spicy alcohol flavor on the follow through. The bitterness lingers with creamy thickness in the mouth for this medium to full bodied brew. There is even a nice carbonation tingle on the tongue. It's been so long since I've had one of these that I had forgotten how good they are. This is an iconic ale that lives up to the hype.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,DrOfGolf,4.05,"Pours out an amber color with a nice thick head. The taste is somewhat fruity and truly different. Some notes of fruit, like blackberry or blueberry with a hoppy finish. All in all a great tasting beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,ThePold,3.73,"Maybe I'm drinking from a mis tapped keg, but this was too malty and dark for me. Wanted a hop bomb, got a malt grenade",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,tekstr1der,4.1,"Tasty traditional IPA from Victory, this might be my favorite from the brewer. Great balance of hop bite and malt backbone. Would look for this fresh again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,HardCider,4.15,"This beer pours a clear dark bronze color with significant effervescence and a moderate head that dissipated quite slowly . As expected, there is a strong, fresh, hoppy aroma. The taste is very pleasant; dry and hoppy with caramel undertones. The mouth feel is a bit syrupy, but still refreshing.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,Dan2213,3.9,"Clear copper leaving a finger of off white head. Aromas of coffee, citrus, and bread. Taste is bold and spicy. Hints of citrus and toffee with a very strong malt backbone. Just a touch of hops and pine. This beer is full bodied and creamy. Nice feel. Overall this a quality offering from Victory. Just a touch too malty for my preference but a solid brew nonetheless",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,1009,3.41,"This beer first appeared on my beer radar very early in the game. I didn't even drink yet. It was the summer before college, we were at a buddy’s house and all the Bud Lights were gone. So, my friend stole a Hop Devil out of the home owner’s basement fridge and proceeded to then hurl it across the room. Full beer went smash. Big mess. From that day on the Hop Devil has always been memorable. That being said, I never actually had one until this week. Like Sam Darnald who lurks in the background, it’s an average beer. Solid pine notes, not overwhelming, but a little heavy. Took a little while to get through, but overall OK.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,MrOH,4.31,"Clear copper, nice off white head, excellent retention, great lace. A good looking beer!

345,1005,Peach63,4.21,"Pours amber with a 1"" cream-colored head, which fades to a wisp. Moderate lacing.  Aroma is citrus, toffee, hay, caramel.  Taste is grapefruit, pine, spice, caramel.

345,1005,Sigmund,3.74,"355 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 6.7%. Clear deep golden to amber to orange colour, moderate white head. Pleasant hoppy aroma, but not overwhelming. Hints of orange marmalade. The flavour is surprisingly well balanced and harmonious for something called ""HopDevil"" - hoppy of course, but no devil is at loose here, rather a benevolent HopAngel. Me like!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,NJBarstool,4.26,This set a standard for the East Coast IBU race of a decade ago. Still a fantastic dank ale.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,milkshakebeersucks,4.2,"Deep bronze color, good sized head and nice lacing. Citrus aroma with a distinct melon quality. Spicy hops dominate the flavor , but there is balance in the aftertaste. Medium bodied, decently carbonated mouthfeel with an average length finish. This has been consistently well made over many years and remains a personal favorite.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,JohnniEMc,4.44,"A go to of mine for years. A nice deep copper color with reasonable head and lacing. The mouth feel is as good as there is outside of NEIPAs. What makes this one special is its delivery of both malt and hop tastes. As it should be, the slightly sweet malt is up front, followed by a lingering earthy and hoppy finish. This is a really good IPA that I've been drinking regularly for years and I never tire of it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Singlefinpin,4.05,"Appears, amber with a nice foamy head that dropped quickly to a nice cap and lacing. Smells dank, citrusy, orange, grapefruit, piney.

345,1005,thefireman,4.68,I reviewed this beer about 18 years ago. One of the originals. One of the best in this style. The beer that put Victory on themap.  Copper color with great lacing. Dank hop smell with malt in the background. Slightly piney hops balanced with caramel malts. Still the best balanced. Nice bitter finish.  Still reaching for this quality beer after all these years.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,OrtheusMaximusRex,4.34,"I liked this beers. An interesting mix of hops, earthiness, dank, not going for super floral and uber fruit, I'd like to have it again, it was in a mix pack, I remember being surprised.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Mugman8,4.17,"Cloudy copper on the pour, some head that dissipates quickly and lots of lacing. Aroma is very piney, with some fruit and malt.

345,1005,defunksta,3.67,"***Disclaimer: I am drinking this 6 months after the expiration date. (Sometimes it's just hard to find fresh beer from far away)***  Appearance: Pours deep, opaque bronze color with a moderate off-white head. Aroma: Wow so different on the aroma. Tons of artificial and medicinal cherry flavor. Some toffee undertones. Flavor: Really not much hops here. Admittedly probably because the beer is far past expired. Huge flavors of Vienna malts. Lots of cherry and toffee. There is bitter licorice though. Some caramel and dark fruit too. Finishes bitter though, but not from any hops flavor. Flavor reminds me of a Vienna lager or a Barleywine based on the malt flavors. Feel: Medium to heavier bodied. Sweet, but bitterness lingers on the palate.  Overall: Take this rating with a huge disclaimer, as this beer was expired and the hop flavor is all lost. I can't say medicinal cherry is what I am looking for in an IPA. It retains the bitterness and malt flavors so it drinks like a bitter Vienna lager or Amber ale. I will need to try this fresh to reevaluate properly and get the hop flavors...***",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,haines710,3.71,"Like others I’m not sure how I never got around to reviewing this beer. Anyway, I had it on tap at the Philadelphia airport. This is an old school IPA that is malty and bitter and brown. I don’t detect much citrus scent or taste. I get pine and caramel and this ends up being a chewy ale that improves as it warms. Not exactly my thing these days but enjoyable and well crafted. Easy to drink with a nice copper brown color.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,JA_26,4.25,"Great beer. This is the one - Victory can stop with all the other IPAs in its lineup (well, except for Hop Wallop), because this one is superb. Beautiful balance between that caramel malt backbone and the piney, gooey bitterness of the hops. Sticks to your ribs but always leaves me wanting another.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,MattDecker,3.89,"Look: amber-copper color Smell: honey, pine-citrus, carmel/malt, maybe some stone fruit Taste: honey, Carmel, malt (it is interesting how much malt taste there is!), Pine-hoppiness comes through and clings to the tongue afterwards. Bitterness is lasting as well Feel: initial feel is very light body, but then transitions to a medium body Overall: an interesting IPA. Very dark in flavor, smell and color that is not typical of ipas that I have had. Not an IPA guy - and this really isn't a typical IPA. Not bad, decent, but I was actually in a mood for an IPA, I don't think I would get this. Glad I tried it though.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,jrc1093,4.03,"Best by 5/31/19  Pours a clear deep ruby copper body topped with around a finger of fluffy, off-white head, which retains itself well for being on the smaller side; consistent, fairly thick lacing holds to the glass while a foamy collar lasts to the end.  Aromas of big, sticky caramel malt dance with heavy grapefruit and prickly pine presence; slight general citrus, but the pine/caramel malt combination is intense and dominates the overall bouquet casually.  Taste shows pine and caramel malt hitting first, but soon balance out with hop spice and minor citrus tones; generally more fruit-forward than the decidedly piney-malty aroma; lightly flambéd grapefruit and bitter hops are more pronounced easing into the finish.  Mouthfeel has a body on the lighter side of medium accompanied by carbonation that’s lower than expected, with a malty crispness and light grit standing in; clean, but the malt and hops carry noticeably through the finish with a bitterness that doesn’t fall out of balance.  Another quality IPA from Victory; this one just kills it with the caramel malt aromatics, and dries out along the way with just enough piney bitterness and citrus to leave the overall product vibrant; as with most of their IPAs, I could return to this one easily.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,jlindros,4.09,"One of those beers I've had 100 times, but somehow don't have a review. I'm fairly certain that I did review it but it was lost in one of the BA server crashes back in the day. Enjoy by 3/22/19 (today)  Pours a decent fizzy bubbly 1/2 finger off-white head that retains well, decent lacing, crystal clear ruby dark amber color  Nose nice American hops, pine, mild citrus, generic fruity and a little earthy, as well as sweet toasted reddish malt, an almost caramel character, borderline red/amber IPA  Taste is also solid, more of the same hops, a bit spicy with some pine notes, more citrus and generic fruity, turning more to pine but also floral hops, then sweet malts to balance the medium-high bitterness, toasted reddish malt and a little caramel like, again a big hoppy amber ale, maybe red/amber IPA these days, but back then it was just a nice IPA with good malt balance and flavors, finishes a little dry but spicy bitter hops lingering  Mouth is medium bod, a bit lighter on the carbonation  Overall not bad, again more like an amber/red IPA rather than American IPA, but when this was made years back there was no differentiation and this was a solid IPA with good malt balance and amber malt characters, enjoyable and a staple for amber IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Mandpasbury,4.03,"When I poured this into a pint glass, I was a bit worried as it is a VERY dark amber color with almost no foam head, not something that usually endears me to a good IPA. The aroma was very Bland as well...not a goox way to start off. But once I took a taste, I forgot about the first two items. It has a very malt-forward taste with a big citrus and slight pine aftertaste. It sits well on the palate with a slight astringent on the back of my tongue, bringing that oh so familiar Piney hop taste and burn, for lack of a better word. It is not heavy at all. Over all this is a very fine IPA offering, one that I would certainly get again. Very solid!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,RockHop,4.2,"Nut brown with a hint of red and nice head without much retention. Well-balanced and mildly sweet with plenty of caramel, malty, bread notes. Hops provide just the right amount of backbone, but don’t overwhelm the beer. Very tasty and unusual; not west coast and not New England. More of a brown IPA/Scotch ale profile.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,DavidD3,3.48,"I get why others like this beer so much, but it just didn't do it for me. There was something about the taste that just felt unbalanced. The floral notes are really nice, but they quickly give way into an astringent bitterness that isn't exactly as nice a follow up as some other IPAs I've had. Beyond that, I didn't much care for the oily mouthfeel. Overall, an okay beer. Not one I would buy again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,mothmanscott,3.94,"From notes 3/6/14: Pours clear medium amber producing 2+ fingers of frothy, off-white, somewhat lasting head that leaves rings and wisps of lace. Aroma is floral and citrus hoppiness with caramel malt tones and hits of dog urine. Taste like the nose is floral and citrus with a hint of tropical fruits, moderately lively spice and backed by sweet caramel malts. The dog urine hint is in the mouth as in the nose. Starts hoppy and slightly sweet, balancing toward bitter hips/sweet malt in the middle, gravitating slowly towards bitter again in the finish but transitioning t o a full bitter hop bite and slightly astringent aftertaste. Just enough malt sweetness here to call this brew moderately balanced. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, a little oily and spicy with moderate carbonation. 4 stars.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Schlitz74,4,"It pours a nice deep amber color with about a finger of off white head. There was nice lacing left on the glass.

Definitely worth a try.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Aglassplease,4,"This brings back memories of one of my favorite ales from years gone by: Pete's Wicked Ale! If Pete's was still around, I bet they would have improved and evolved into this. This pours slightly brown and coppery. Hint of caramel with a perfect balance of hops. Good choice if you are in the mood to have more than a few. I would call this an American Brown IPA.

(3.75)  M: Mediumish body with bright carbonation and a dry hop-shellac finish. (4.25)  O: This is a nice ""old school"" IPA. I don't necessarily like that term, but here we are. Looks exactly like you'd hope, clear with all right retention. The aroma and flavor are both of spicy, somewhat earthy hop flavors intermingled with bready/caramely malt flavors. It is dry and drinkable with medium bitterness. Whenever I have beers like this these days it is a breath of fresh air. I adore NEIPAs as much as the next guy, but being so swamped with them makes beers like this that much more enjoyable.

345,1005,nicholas2121,4.25,"HopDevil India Pale Ale brewed by Victory Brewing Company with an ABV of 6.70% This American IPA pours out a deep golden amber color with a nice white. There is also a nice amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich with hop bitterness and a slight sweetness. You also pick up a good amount of earthy grains and malts in the smell as well. So far this brew has the look and smell of most American IPA's on the market, not saying that is a bad thing. Now for the taste, it is Bold with flavors. You first get a blast of hop bitterness, then this brew mellows out to a smooth sweetness. There is a lot going on in HopDevil India Pale Ale. The body of this IPA is a solid medium. There is nothing overpowering about this brew, it has a nice balance to it. It is really hard to pick up on the 6.70% ABV in this brew, it is just that smooth. The mouth feel is Bold, Hoppy, Rich, Smooth, Clean and Refreshing. Overall I'm going to give HopDevil India Pale Ale a 4.25 out of 5.

Very pleasant and would pair well with pub grub.  M: heavier side of mid-weight. Moderate carbonation. Slightly slick finish.  O: i like this beer. It is a relic of sorts; a classic and easy-drinking IPA. Not trying to impress you with magical tropical hops, 1000 IBUs, or even a refreshing crispness.

345,1005,SmashPants,4.21,"Format: standard 330mL brown bottle with a reasonably funky label - not taking itself too seriously. Very American, and suggests heavily-hopped, which suits me fine.  Appearance: pours a deep orange-amber with plenty of carbonation visible. A fantastic two fingers of tan head pops up and drops to a rocky finger. Looks good.  Aroma: big notes of pine hops with resin and caramel behind.  Taste: I'm quite surprised at how much caramel there is here, still dominated by those hops though, which stands to reason. Very well-balanced, the caramel really adds something to a heavily hopped beer so you don't risk the potential of hop bitterness overload.  Aftertaste: some hop bitterness with a lingering sweetness.  Mouth feel: medium in body with good carbonation, very easy drinking for a beer so high in ABV.

Overall a very good entry level ipa that won't scare off people who think ipas are all totally bitter and undrinkable. very well crafted,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,DarkSideOfTheMoon,3.82,Pours a transparent copper color with a thick foam - not much lacing. Smell is faint on the hops as compared to other beers of the same style. Taste is certainly reminiscent of your east coast or new england IPAs. Much heavier on the malt but the balance is clear in this one as the finish is very smooth. A decent IPA especially for the price - but there are better choices for the style.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,badgerbeer1,2.19,"I had this in cruddy bar, so I hope the negativity is product of poor taps. Looked great, smelled awful. Had two and smell was same. Ruined taste, most likely. Again, review could be skewed due to poor taps",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,BeerBobber,3.99,Dark hazy orange amber colered beer with a frothy bone colored head of about on finger.  Smells of pine and some sweet citrus. Just a touch of dankness. Some breadiness here as well.  Taste follows the nose with that sweet citrus and pine type of bitter. The bitterness on the taste is far from overwhelming. The bitter seems to come towards the back of the taste.  Mouth feel to me was a surprisingly lighter feel than some IPA varities. There is a bit of an oily finish and some resin coating the lips.  Overall I like this IPA and glad I gave it a shot. When I poured the last of my can into my glass I got a shit ton of sediment. I already have some favorite IPA's and do not feel as if I would bump one from my list for this IPA. That said it is a well done IPA and may be the one that gets your motor started. I reccomend this for any fan of the style.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,jvgoor3786,3.75,"Poured from a can with a best by date of Nov. 20, 2017. The beer pours a deep, clear amber color. There is a thick off-white head with thick lacing.  The smell explodes with citrus hops but there is also a strong malt backbone.  The taste is deep, bitter pine hops with a decent malt backbone. There is not a lot of citrus that comes through in the taste, just tons of bitter, floral hops.  The mouthfeel is thick with medium carbonation.  Overall this is good but a bit more floral hops than I expected from the smell.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,HorseheadsHophead,2.96,"L: Clear amber with a tight beige head. Moderate retention, with some splotchy lacing.  S: Super sweet toasty malt, tons of caramel and toffee and toasted brown bread. There's a little bit of grapefruit juice and woody, pine as well, but it's mostly tons of malt.  T: Caramel, toffee, and toasted bread throughout. There is a little bit of grapefruit juice and grapefruit in the mid-palate, but overall this is cloying. There's some earthy and piney bitterness near the finish, but that cloying caramel malt just sticks hard.  F: Medium-bodied, medium-carbonated, very sticky with all the residuals sugars.  O: Not my cup of tea. This is bad IPA, in my honest opinion. Victory makes a ton of great beer and I love most of it, but this is not one of them.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Lone_Freighter,3.77,"It pours a translucent amber gold body with a head that disappears within a couple seconds. Even with an aggressive pour, the head didn’t last. Some light lace ran here and there. The smell has an earthy hoppiness that isn’t overbearing. I noticed a bit of clove and cinnamon. The taste has the earthy hoppiness again along with the clove and cinnamon. The palate has a low to medium amount of carbonation. Between light and medium bodied. ABV felt appropriate. Overall, a pretty good IPA that I would come back to.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,monkist,4.69,"Had Dirt Wolf earlier from Victory so I knew I had to try their other staple IPA. A very nice and nostalgic experience indeed - athough they are from Pennsylvania, this beer reminds me some of the great craft IPAs that have been recently made in Hungary - though just a mere coincide. Looks also follow this, I noticed that Hungarian IPAs tend to be filtered sharp and clear with a golden brownish, caramellized malty hue. Although on the hoppy side they are unbeatable: this Hop Devil is full of Citra, and it has been shamelessly dry hopped with it as well. The more I drink it the more it reminds me of the good old IPAs of Hungary, East Coast style from East Europe. Good to know that we had such an example to aim for. It is quite different from your ""average"" American IPAs, in a good way. Although for me personally it might not be something shockingly brand new, I am glad for this one. Very well done, and the hopping puts the icing on the cake (or on the beer).",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,Czequershuus,4.53,"This beer pours a rich amber with an average head. The aroma is dank and resinous, with pine, cannabis, caramel, and grapefruit pith. The flavor is much the same, dominated by resinous flavors of pine and cannabis, and highlighted by bitter grapefruit peel. The bitterness is nice and high, and well contrasted by malt. The mouthfeel is full, rich, and sticky. Overall this is a true classic IPA, with sticky, rich, piney flavors.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,ordybill,4.52,"Poured from a 12 OZ bottle into a pint glass at Taco Mac in Peachtree City. The appearance is a slightly cloudy copper color with a medium sized off-white colored head.

An excellent IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

L: Pours Light amber with a slight head and visible carbonation rising up S: Very bright and citrusy aroma, a little bit a malt T/F: Very smooth with some sweetness and bready taste with a lingering bitterness. Some pine in the front with pretty solid carbonation  Overall a very solid beer, it is very easy to drink and does not bash you on the head with lots of bitterness, something that is often overdone in this style. Would gladly drink again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,EMV,4.19,"Had many times... this particular tasting was poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Dogfish tulip. I've always been a fan of the devil du hops artwork.  L: Clear copper/caramel pour. Thin off-white head. Spotty lacing.  S: Rich and biscuity grains... pungent pine, grapefruit, and herbal hops.  T/F: Follows the nose. Caramel malts and grains which lead to a big bitter hop profile. Grapefruit and pepper... resinous pine, and a bit herbal. Very assertive... reminds me of baking. Medium body and solid carbonation. Finish is spice and pepper which lingers on the palate.  O: One of my first favorite IPA's, and just as good now with a belated re-visit. I tend to hit Dirtwolf more frequently but you can't go wrong by hitting up the classics. This was the beer that made sitting at Phillies games a joy.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,trygelski1,4,12oz bottle poured into a Roundabout Brewing tulip glass:  Look: Pours an amber color with about an inch of head. Lacing is present with decent retention.  Smell: Very strong malt backbone with some sweetness present on the aroma with citrus and hops present as well.  Taste: Notes of citrus and pine are present but I wish there was more. Sweet malty finish along with some bready notes. Definitely not the hop devil as the label indicates.  Feel: Medium bodied.  Overall: Very solid IPA from Victory. Wish this had a bit less sweetness and malt and more hops so this could be the devil as the label indicates. I would definitely pick this up again though and consume.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,drgonzo767,4.05,"Is it unfair I ultimately knock this for untruth in advertising? Because I do. To me, ""hop devil"" says blast you in the damn face with hops, and this does not. Poured from a bottle into a pilsner glass.  Looks beautiful. Amber red, full head. Nice lacing as I drink it.  Smells of malt, and in fact a nice sophisticated malt smell, light hops, there's some biscuit in there but what do I know, I have slight cold.  As a dedicated hop head, here is my beef: to me the malt is much stronger than the hop. Now, that's wonderful if you don't call your beer HOP DEVIL. It's a very light hop and citrus balanced with the malt. Call it something else and I would be raving about it. Twenty years ago and I would be raving about it. But today you kind of expect something else when promised the Lord of Darkness Himself of hops. That's why I have to knock down the overall score, it is not what is promised, although it is very good as a beer in and of itself.  Feel is about right. It's lightly carbonated, slight oil and dryness on the finish. I could drink six of these. Refreshing.  Again, I temper this review with my thoughts on the name. I don't think that is unfair. A real hop head will not be getting what they think they are with a name like that. But this is a damn fine beer, very balanced, very drinkable, very satisfying. I would drink this again, and I would drink a six pack of this. Just know what you are getting and you will pleased: a very balanced almost malt heavy AIPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,ricke49,4.74,Had forgotten how well balanced this eastern style IPA from Victoty was. Malt finish is near perfect and a nice change of pace from West Coast style I typically find available in Oregon.

Feel- Light-Medium bodied despite color and malty finish. Overall- Fantastic beer. The hoppy citrus flavor is balanced out by a sweet malty finish. Definitely worth a try and could be a go to brew.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Beers-es,4.02,Pours a clear copper with a finger of off-white foam. Smell and taste is what you'd call balanced--spicy hops in equal proportion with sweeter malts.

This beer has the label, promise, and attitude of a dangerous bite of hops. Although this is not a nuclear explosion of hops as expected, this is a phenomenal IPA.  An attractive amber, ever so slightly cloudy/red pour, a minimally discolored pretty head rests at one inch or less.  This beer has a respectable citrus kick that immediately floods the mouth. You feel the intensity that tries to breath through. It's not quite the devil that it proclaims, but still a taste that leaves you smacking your lips and reathing through the mouth to enjoy the strong hop accents that try to punch through this bold, summery (and dare I say..playful?) IPA.  It has the attitude and initial punch of a triple IPA, but quickly forgives with citrus and summer character. One of my favorites.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Pours a plenty thick head, with an off white color to it. Lots and lots of sticky lacing while drinking. The body is mostly translucent; maybe a touch of haze to it.  Aroma: kind of disappointing....some bitter hops, some malty sweet notes, maybe a smidgeon of citrus underneath. Definitely more of a ""classic"" IPA in its scent.  Taste: thankfully, this beer hasn't aged badly at all despite not being en vogue at the moment. Packs tons of hop complexity and is perfectly balanced and delicious. Begins lightly sweet, with some nice citrusy and dank notes, and finishes piny and bitter. Moderate malt backbone doesn't overwhelm or over-sweeten the beer.  Feel: silky smooth and full-bodied for a less than 7% IPA, this drinks super nice.  Overall: everyone reminisces about how this was their go-to before the recent hop haze and juice revolution, but this beer is still fantastic.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,thebeers,4.15,"For years, this was my go-to beer. Remember being blown away by the hops when I first tried it at Bob and Barbara's in Philly around year 2000. Today, it's not all that outrageous, but you've got to respect your elders and appreciate the classics.  Pours a nice copper color with an off-white head that leaves decent lacing. What I get in the aroma these days is actually a wallop of malty sweetness, but there's fairly grapefruit-ish, earthy hops in there, too. These hops continue to the taste, with a strong malt balance, that's somewhat nutty in character. Medium to heavy bodied for an IPA.  What can I say? The newcomers have surpassed it in the decades that have followed, but this is still a damn good beer.

345,1005,Caj1,4.62,"A: Beautiful copper-amber with a tinge of ruby. Crystal clear and with medium carbonation. I didn't pour with quite as much gusto as usual since I was using a different glass from normal, but I got a finger of dense, creamy off-white head. Great head retention, I poured this baby up, let it sit for about ten minutes and it still had a thick film of foam across the top. Wonderful lacing, it just won't stop clinging to the sides of the glass.  S: Very good caramel creates the backbone of the scent profile. Sweet and malty like a good IPA should smell. Really 50/50 on the malt/hops ratio. I also detect spicy notes and some slight (emphasis on slight) estery scents, like banana. Some grainy notes come through but remind of fresh whole grain bread. Hops aren't huge on the nose, but don't really need to be. I get some resinous, deep notes, and as a whole it definitely edges on piney and general ""dank"" earthy tones, but there is a tinge of lemongrass.  T: Counterintuitive to what I expected on the smell, the hops are forward here. Malt does a great job of supporting and balancing the bitter and deep green hops. At first, the resinous, earthy flavors are very pronounced, but don't overstay their welcome. Medium bitterness overall. Malt is subtle, but I do get definite caramel and a little bit of a brown sugar flavor. Again, reminds me of fresh baked artisan bread. As the beer warms, the spicy, fruity flavors come out to play. Pepper tingles on the tongue toward the end of the taste experience.  F: It tastes like a DIPA but doesn't feel like one. Medium bodied overall, not something that I could pound down but it's crisp like any good IPA should be. Doesn't finish remarkably clean, but it has some astringency from the slightly higher alcohol content which helps give it a slightly dry bite after the swallow.  Overall: Easily one of the best beers I've had the pleasure of reviewing. Balanced, complex without going crazy, and overall a joy to savor. I don't have much else to say about this, I've already written an article.  To good health and good beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

S: Floral hops and wild grass, some earthy notes, also quite a bit of caramel malt. The aroma on this one isn't nearly as strong as some other IPAs.  T: Starts out with a very strong bitterness, followed by floral hops, some pine and then ends with a lot of sweet malt. Kinda odd how the beer goes from very bitter to quite sweet by the finish, quite interesting.  F: Medium body, nice and creamy carbonation a pretty easy drinking IPA.

Slowly recedes to an afterthought. Smell hints at a little malt sweetness after a wash of piney, grassy hops that move to citrus.

Chilled to 39 degrees, allowed to sit for 5-10 minutes before opening, poured into a large wine glass.  Look: Pours a nice orange/red amber color with a 1inch tan colored head. Noticeable carbonation held the head up longer than some other beers and continued until the end. When head finally dissipated it left a light foam coating with some lacing. Very promising visuals.  Smell: Hard to determine, some floral/grassy notes, bit of spice, hint of pine.  Taste: Hops and malt seem to be balanced at the start, lightly resinous, grassy but not totally unpleasant aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Medium body, carbonation is noticeable throughout.  Overall: Drinkable but unimpressive. Cool looking label seemed to promise more than I got. It really held it's carbonation well, always a plus.

345,1005,cjgiant,3.69,"On tap at brewery (8/2019): Lovely clarity and a lasting off white head. Amber leaning towards a light brown ale, lacing is fair.  Nose is somewhat disappointingly light. Some toasted grain and hints of sweet citrus, spice, and something grassy or pithy. Too much guessing, though.  A nice toasted malt base that reminds me of the start of a classic ESB. Carbonation leans just over the line to slightly aggressive. Spice and citrus hop notes - clove and orange peel. For a half a second it could be an ESB, but the hop bitterness grows. Medium body, but drinks a little lighter. The piney finishing note sticks around, with the orange sneaking in a return appearance dry late.  Hard to call this balanced, but there is a decent malt backbone here trying to support the barrage of hop bitterness. The weighing of the aroma brings my adjusted score a bit lower than I feel about it.  Original review nitro: Of course it looked lovely on nitro. Amber golden once the waterfall of a nitro pour subsided.  Nose had a surprising light citrus note to it. Wasn't too strong, but was there. Generic vegetal notes otherwise. I'll blame the nitro.  Generally avoid IPAs on nitro, but was in an adventurous mood. This came across as a lightly caramel honey malt opening backed by the hops from the nose, but more bitter than the nose indicated. This was not a bitter pour, but the hops played nicely and did win the battle by the end.  Feel was what would be expected from a nitro pour, smooth with any harshness muted.  Actually a better experience that I was thinking I'd have originally. Definitely need to revisit this with a fresh regular bottle of this beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

This Hop Devil I have seen many times on the shelf, but the label is a bit cartoonish and so it took me awhile to finally give it a try. This one is 6.7% ABV.  Look-It pours a beautiful dark copper amber that glints with hues of red in the sun. The lacing is sparse lending to the thin head that settles quickly.  Smell-It smells of malty breads, molasses, oak, and a bit of sweetness. The hops aren’t as noticeable as the malts. It is a bit fruity and very malty. A bit of worry overcomes me.  Taste-The worry fades away as I taste a medium to full bodied hoppy brew with excellent flavors of pine, grassy hops, caramel, some fruits, and some mild citrus. The malts can really be described as dark breads and oaky deliciousness, but the hops do come through nicely on the palate.  Mouthfeel-It is, as I’ve said, medium to full bodied and has an oily hoppy finish. Nice lingering on the tongue that captures its hop essence.  Overall-It is a really nice beer.

The hops were definitely immediately apparent. I found that the palate had a very pleasant hoppy character without being too bitter. However, the finish had a somewhat bready, malty character that made me think this bottle might have been a tad stale. The feel was very pleasant--a nice, crisp bite with no apparent flaws.

Light messy lacing slides into the beer. The smell had some bright citrus and piney notes over some light spice and then the caramel malt. The taste was moderately the same with a sweetness coming from the malt and the hops. There's a soft bittersweet aftertaste leading into the finish. The mouthfeel was about light bodied with a sly herbal quality lending a hand to a nice smoothness not normally associated with AIPA's, but hey, here comes the bitterness and it hits my tongue nicely. Overall, this was a pretty nice AIPA.

Definitely the high point. Surprised by this beer, in a bad way. Unbalanced in the completely wrong direction. This was not the freshest sample, but it was well within the brewer's best-by date, ergo, I expect more hops.

Appearance: The bar I was at was pretty dark, so it's difficult to provide a good review of the color, but the beer appeared clear and deep amber, with a soft head that collapsed under the ABV after a reasonable time but not too fast. Looks like a solid IPA.  Smell: Bright citrus and pine hoppiness. Very little malt presence in the nose at all.  Taste: Pleasently 'juicy' but also maintains a pleasant bitterness on the very back end, drying out the palate and prompting another sip. Hop flavors are predominantly citrus, though I also tasted solid assertions of pine and a soft note of herbalness. Medium malt body carries the beer nicely, without getting cloying or thin.  Mouthfeel: Medium to medium-high body. Medium carbonation. Very drinkable without feeling thin or heavy. Really great for an IPA.

345,1005,LanceA,4.33,"Let me preface my remarks by saying that I am a students of brews rather than an expert, and that despite all the hype, IPA is not my favorite style. I liked this IPA more than most I've tried--definitely more than Stone IPA. The color is a pleasing amber. The smell is pepper and spice, and reminded me a bit of a Bloody Mary. No smell of fruit that I could detect. The beer was pleasingly bubbly on the tongue. The taste began as malty and mildly sweet, without much citrus taste that I could detect. The finish was mildly bitter and spicy. However, the aftertaste was very bitter, and lingered long on the tongue. If Stone is a ""bitter bomb,"" and Sculpin and Bell are ""citrus bombs,"" then this is somewhere in between: not perhaps rising to the level of a ""spice bomb,"" but close. I have a feeling that I'll be coming back to this one.  EDIT: Sometimes the malt smell is more prominent, although whether this is from the batch or the glass, I don't know. Also, the bitterness does not last as long sometimes. In any case, I've decided that this is my favorite IPA, even though it does not conform to the current ideal of the ""Hop bomb.""

After sipping there is a definite toasty note lingering on the tongue. Id be interested in seeing the grist bill for this brew. Not going to lie the taste threw me off a bit. It had the malty richness or a trippel but the bitterness and refreshing hints of a very hoppy IPA. Not unenjoyable, just unexpected.  Overall: An IPA to break the mold. Hoppy and complex. I can see why people love this brew but to be honest it wasn't my favorite. It has a certain heaviness in the flavor that I think appeals to many and almost feels like a ""winter ipa"" if you would.

345,1005,Budlum,4.14,"The body is a very deep Amber, bordering on red, that is top with a lasting white head. The nose is sweet and malty for an IPA, but the hops are prevalent and nicely balances. A strong sweet malt flavor dominates from the start with a toasted sensation, but the key is that hop flavors are playing along the whole time. The complexity of this is wonderful. This beer has been around for a while and should not be overlooked in the way of the hop bombs of today.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,VABA,4.09,"Revisited 4/5/18  Pours a nice clear darkened amber color with a nice head and lacing. Aroma has subtle hop hints, the taste follows the nose but with lots of malt. A medium bodied beer with a decent amount of carbonation. A well balanced, well made beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,DuffDaddy,2.75,"Got a single from LEGOLAND Publix to celebrate National IPA day. Good for an IPA...mild hoppiness and only a mild headache afterwards - I'll call that a success. Definitely not ""devilish"". Enjoyed while watching Peaky Blinders on Netflix.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,frozyn,4.16,"L -- Pours copper with a small off-white head that quickly fizzles out. No lacing on this pour.  S -- Immediate, bold grapefruit scent, along with a minute lemon zest ending, right after pouring. Develops into a more balanced hop aroma with resin joining the fray. There's a minor sweetness to it as well that adds complexity to the hops.  T -- Flavor very much follows the aroma: grapefruit, pine, with a strong bitterness to go along with it. The end notes are very much resiny, but the sweetness from the aroma melds with it to lessen the overall bitter-blow. The malts add a bready component, sorta like a tasty honey-nut flavored loaf, plus some minor caramel notes.  F -- Medium body, crisp, refreshing: very drinkable. I'll actually call it full-bodied for an IPA as the more I drink it, the ""richer"" it starts to feel in my life. It leaves a fairly dry palate and the bitterness leaves a light zing on the tongue.  O -- A very good beer. It's a great east coast IPA example, with plenty of hops and a solid malt backbone to go with it. I'd be happy to have this in the fridge all the time.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,BeerPredator,3.87,"Appears medium amber with nice laced head on it. Smells malty and sweet with pine notes; malt aroma takes the hops. Observable alcohol taste but not too overpowering; hits you while swallowing the beer. Carmel and syrupy tasting, lingers in the mouth in a pleasing way. Would not describe as a ""heavy hitting"" IPA but has a alcohol presence. If you like malt-forward IPAs I would recommend. Wish I could have had this from a tap fresh!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Aroma of pine, grapefruit, caramel and sweet malt. Medium bitterness, light sweetness and a hint of saltiness. Noticeable alcohol. Light to medium body; thin, slightly sticky texture; average carbonation; noticeable malt backbone and a long, slightly dry, pine bitterness in the finish. Not as hop dominant as I was expecting but decent enough. 8.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

I'm a little suprice of the malty nose! Caramel malt, bread, fudge, brown sugar, butter, biscuit, fudge and grass. Taste: Caramel malt, grass, pine, dark bread, hops and oak. Body: Medium to full body. Medium carbonation. Smooth, oily taste.  A great IPA from Victory! Bold and malty! I really like this.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Raime,3.33,"Hop Devil by Victory Brewing.  Never had one outta these guys. Let us hope it works out in my favor.  Look - Pours clear amber with a two finger slightly off white head that sticks around like a good father. The carbonation is on low with this one. No cloud formations to speak of. Yet at least. Leaves good lacing. 4.  Smell - Dominated by the malts and a half grapefruit mix. There really isn't a whole lot to say here. Half and half wins this race. 3.25.  Taste - The grapefruit pith is most prevelant really. The malts are certainly there but it is absolutely nothing to write home about. Basic IPA. 3.25.  Feel - Medium carbonation with a slighty watery body. Only thing saving this aspect is the creaminess. 3.  Overall - Blah. Generic as can be, nothing new here. Uninpressive, even for the style. I'd pass in the future. 3.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,jjamadorphd,3.97,"My first try of a Victory beer and I was very pleased. Apparently though, not as pleased as others, but I still enjoyed this offering.  I had it as a draft - great golden brown coloration with a weak head but strong lacing down the glass - quite impressive really. I noted some citrusy scents that mixed well with the strong hoppy aroma. The brew was well carbonated (more so than to my liking) and the aftertaste was a big surprise to me, since lately I've had some strong IPAs and haven't had the aftertaste I experienced with this beer. I didn't note the citrusy odor in the beer itself, which I expected, but IPA was definitely bold in flavor. Overall, it was a very good beer and would definitely partake from it again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Slaterlovesbeer,4.04,"Poured into a random glass from my cabinet. A beautiful amber color, darker than most ipas. Very grassy and pine-y. Not the same citrus notes found in other ipas, an interesting difference. Aroma also very grassy. Extremely smooth for and ipa and suprisingly refreshing. Not quite as good as langunitas ipas though.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,TH28,3.78,"12oz bottle. Code date of 8/9/15. Appearance: Deep amber and clear with a light khaki head. Aroma: relatively faint hop aroma for an American IPA. Some floral and herbal notes, but it’s minimal. Caramel malt also noticeable. Taste: Rich caramel and toasty malt flavors dominate, with a sharp hop bitterness that has some herbal and resinous notes. Mouthfeel: Medium body with some viscosity and low carbonation. Finish: Some lingering herbal bitterness and caramel malt. Overall: Definitely an east coast as opposed to west coast IPA. More malt balanced than a west coast IPA. Drinks like a slightly hoppier American Amber",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Lahoi,4.55,"First of all, wow!  A deep Amber copper color. Creamy off white head that never fully dissipates. Beautiful lacing.  The smell was good, but it didn't prepare me for the taste. The smell was underwhelming. The taste was certainly not.  Very hoppy. Finishes very sharp. A little salty, even.  Feels almost creamy, but not heavy. My favorite aspect of the beer.  Overall, a beautiful beer. If you like IPAs, give it a try. If you don't like IPAs, save your money because it's truly an IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

The thing was I could tell this was going to be the case from the aromas alone . . . and this bottle still has 4 months until it's best by date. The appearance is nice enough. It glows and even looks attractive and inviting in the glass.

Very lightly sweet arrival which quickly fades into a quite weak bitter hop ending. F - 4 - Good smooth and decently oily mouthfeel. O - 3.5 - This is what I call a food pairing beer and a shower beer.

Hop aroma a bit subdued, but may be sampling this beer at too cold of a temperature.  Nice maltiness up front is immediately balanced by a lovely nutty hop flavor. Hop flavors more pine than fruit, and has a nice bitterness all the way through. No harsh bitterness break on the back end. Bitterness and overall hop flavors are well done.  Medium body and carbonation, no astringency or harshness from the hops. Maybe a very slight alcohol warming.  Super drinkable for a hoppy IPA. Not overpowering despite being intensely hoppy and quite bitter. Sufficient malt from which to hang the hops.

345,1005,PostRockandCats,3.9,"Pours a cloudy, copper with a nice soapy head. Minimal, fine lacing. The head eventually settles into a nice, tan foam on top.  Smells surprisingly malty for an IPA; lots of fruit and brown bread notes before the hops kick in. It tastes even maltier, which is nice albeit a bit shocking from a beer called ""Hop Devil."" Lots of raisin and brown bread notes on the tongue with floral hops up front and resiny, bitter hops at the end, punctuating the heavy sweetness of the malt.  It feels somewhat heavy for this style; it's a smooth, medium brew, but with a somewhat aggressive carbonation to even it out. It works well here. But, to be sure, it's a heavier feel for an IPA.  Overall, this is an unusual IPA with the heavy malt presence and feel, but still refreshing and different. I was tempted to rate this lower, but I really like the originality here! I will get this again. I can see this going well with a nice beef or lamb roast.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Smell: piney and citrus hops  Taste: Fairly traditional American IPA palate with strong caramelly malt sweetness that nearly balances the strong piney lemon tangerine hops. Lingering bitterness on the tongue.  Feel: Light to medium body and smooth mouthfeel.  Overall: A well-crafted traditional IPA. However, the sweetness approaches excessive for my taste, and the hops while good are nothing to rave about. Although it would have stood out on the shelves 10 or 15 years ago, there are enough interesting alternatives out there now that I don't see myself returning to the Hop Devil.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,Jim_Benz,3.4,"A: Beautiful, clear orange/amber with an unremarkable head.  S: Malty, mostly caramel, almost sour. WTF? I guess I pick up some pine and a little indistinct citrus, but malt seems to dominate the nose.  T: Well-balanced between malt and hops, but flavors pretty much follow the nose and I'm having a difficult time pulling out any nuances. Sweet pine? Over-ripe orange? Dandelion? I just don't know. Lots of caramelly malt, for sure, but I expected something more. Like, maybe this beer could live up to its name? At least it leads and finishes piney bitter, but with a whole lot of caramel in between. The combination, I think, is what makes this smell/taste almost sour. But a strange sour, like dandelion wine.  M: What you'd expect for an IPA and maybe a touch thicker. Carbonation is fine.  O: I've had this beer before and don't recall disliking it. But today? I don't think I'd buy it again.

Nice bit of malt character on the nose to go with the piney qualities that a west coast type of ale (despite this being from PA) will have.

Taste: This is one of the better IPA's I have had in a while. Nice combination of malts and hops. Bitter grapefruit and pine but combined well with the malt to make this a smooth and well made IPA.

It's a 12oz bottle, fresh (over 2 months till it's past its due date). The color is good, but it poured quite syrupy into the glass. The smell is malty, with just a touch of citrus fruits. The taste is, as I said, bland. Almost no taste, bread like perhaps, with a mild grapefruit and pine aftertaste. It's a bit thick on the tongue. Overall I'm somewhat disappointed.

The aroma is very floral and herbaceous, with a dominant, sweet maltiness among toasty biscuits and grains.  The flavor shows a toasted malt base with moderate sweetness, which enhances the uprising fresh, sharp hop bitterness. Green grass and grapefruit bite into the tongue, while the toasty maltiness with hints of toffee keep things in good balance. Medium bodied and crisp on the palate, the finish is on the dry side, while malt still shines trough. The most convincing part of this IPA is its aftertaste, as it is surprisingly long and superdry, with hops sparking very late on the back of the palate, unleashing an enjoyable taste of fruits and grass just at the moment when you begin to think it may be over already.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Nose of caramel malts, citrus and pine hops, grapefruit, orange zest, and lemon peel. Flavors are sweet to the sides, bitter hops to the back, and citrus hops over all. This is a finely balanced IPA that even a non-hop head like myself can enjoy. Tons of citrus malts, light bittering to the aftertaste, and a great malt backbone that gives it a fantastic drinkability.

345,1005,StoneTSR,4.15,"APPEARANCE: The color of this beer is gorgeous; a medium shade of copper-orange that is nearly crystal clear. A finger and a half of head rises with the first poor then settles into a coaster-sized cap. Hundreds of bubbles surround the outsides of the glass and dart up to the top as soon as the wiggle themselves free from the glass itself. The lacing is not super thick, but it leaves a record of each sip with a nice layer.  SMELL: The fruit aromas are the star of the show here. Grapefruit (with a little sugar on top), orange and maybe a touch of apricot are all here. Some pine with a hint of grass and some nice floral notes complete the smell.  TASTE: A luscious caramel backbone provides a canvass for all the traditional, American-style IPA flavors to play; grass, pine, orange, grapefruit, mango (maybe?) and biscuit. The bready finish is a perfect complement to the malty start.  MOUTHFEEL: Sweet to start, dry to finish. Medium bodied with a pleasant sparkle.  OVERALL: We have some outstanding IPAs in this market here in Colorado, but there are very few East Coast-style IPAs that are made this well.

345,1005,ThePaintedGrey,4.38,"12oz. bottle poured into pub glass.  *Re-reviewed based on more recent experience* Reviewed on 7/26/2014. Bottled just barely 2 week prior to drinking.  A: A hazy copper color that's deep in the middle, but lighter around the sides. A large, frothy cream-colored head sits on top and retains for quite a long time before deflating to a pinky-thick head that sticks around until the end. Lots of thick, sticky lacing left all down the glass.  S: Lots of pine resin with a very forward citric zest. A little bit of alcoholic spice comes through. There's not a whole lot of sweetness to be found here. Very earthy, very hoppy. Very nice.  T: The initial bitter characteristics are rather merciless, no doubt a result from how fresh this batch is. The hops have not yet been tamed by time and absolutely dominate your palette with little mercy spared by the honey-like sweetness that creeps in the background. As the beer swishes through your mouth, some earthy, pine resin, and grassy notes sneak in and compliment the prominent grapefruit/orange profile. A little spice from the alcohol lingers in the end, along with some hop bitterness. Flavors flow wonderfully along the spectrum, ranging from bitter, to semi-sweet, to spicy.  M: Viciously smooth with a thick, creamy body. A light carbonation slightly tingles the tongue, but keeps things very subtle and gentle, which really allows those wonderful flavors to shine. A bit of tingling in the throat from the alcohol reminds you that this is no light lager, but this one is oh-so-drinkable and goes down easy. No need to alter this section; HopDevil benefits from a consistent mouthfeel.  O: HopDevil was, and currently is still, my go-to local beer. I drink it several times a month and could probably pick it out of a line-up in my sleep. I decided that now's a good time to update my review, as this is the freshest batch I've ever tasted (basically snagged the six pack right off the truck). You would think that my score would diminish, having been exposed to so many more incredible beers since my initial review, but that's not the case here. HopDevil remains consistently remarkable. It's one of the few IPAs I've had that come dangerously close to DIPA territory in terms of flavor. Boisterous hops provide a wonderfully complex display of juiciness, bitterness, and Earthiness, with a lingering spice in the finish. To me, this is a humble, yet world-class IPA that might just be Victory's magnum opus.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Gear54,4.74,From a bottle into a pilsner glass. Bought this bottle yesterday couldn't wait to crack it.  A: deep gold with a burnt orange hue. Not much light penetration. Little head and no lace to speak of. I can see the carbonation rising rapidly in the glass.  S: pungent hops with light citrus aroma on the tail end.  T: bitter and hoppy from start to finish. The citrus smell carries over to lemon notes mixed with those hops.  M: fantastically smooth for such a bitter bomb in flavor. I could drink this all day.  O: I find myself wondering how I waited so long to pick this up and give it a try. If you an IPA/DIPA drinker this is a must try.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Louisville-Beer-Reviews,4.36,"Appearance: Clear amber color with orange edges, a thick, fine, creamy head, and beautiful sheets of lace.  Aroma: Citrusy hop aroma of overripe stone fruit, like peaches, or apricots. The hop character is a bit funky, like the fruit is slightly too far gone.  Taste & Mouthfeel: The medium bodied texture carries light, sweet, fruity flavors, and green, fresh hops on the tongue. The fruity sweetness combined with the grassy hop create the overripe stone fruit/peach character, with the finish presenting full, biscuity malt flavor, subtle pear, and spicy hop. The hop bitterness is well balanced throughout, but shows a bit too much resiny bitterness on rest (about 5-10 seconds after you’ve swallowed).  Final Word: This is a great IPA! It carries plenty of hop flavor, but offers a unique spicy, peachy, grassy profile instead of your typical grapefruit/bitterness combo found in many IPAs. While the bitterness was a bit too unpleasant after swallowing, it merely kept the beer from being perfect, not from being excellent. The texture and balance made for an extremely drinkable IPA, while still offering enough complexity and nuance to please any drinker. I particularly enjoyed the hint of pear in the finish, as it followed this beer’s trend of surprising you with many atypical flavors. This beer is a must try for any IPA lover, and should only be avoided by those that aren’t used to hoppy beers yet.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Scipio3,3.3,"I love Victory DirtWolf so I had high hopes for this brew. Appearance, smell and mouthfeel was all good, but I was disappointed in the taste. However, I then remembered that DirtWolf was a DIPA, and comparing wasn't fair, nor the intent of these reviews. As a IPA, this was a good beer. No citrusy taste, but good hops and flavor.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Has an almost apple-like acidity mixed with a bit of pear fruitiness. Strange spice like flavor that I can't quite gather.  Medium body with medium to low carbonation. A bit viscous and wet.  Not what I remembered. Doesn't have a pop on the hop profile but rather a smooth-like earthy undertone carried by a malt backbone.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,JPowell712,4.55,I remember this being one of the very first hop heavy beers I fell in love with. It had that sting of hops and hop bite that was overpowering and took my tastebuds by storm.

345,1005,WesMantooth,3.45,"Pours a nice deep transparent copper color. When I first stuck my nose in this beer I thought it smelled like stale, dirty dish water. Luckily, it tasted much better. Mix of pine and citrus hops up front that are balanced out quickly by sweet carmel malt. Does not finish too bitter. In all fairness, maybe I had too many hoppy beers before reviewing so I will revisit, but right now I would say good- not great.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

It halves in size & leaves some good lacing on the glass too.  Hoppy initially with a malty & caramel base, some sweetness & a little pine. Some alcohol comes through & it's a good smelling beer with some grapefruit & orange too.  Strong hop presence that the nose featured & the malts as well. Grapefruit, some orange & citrus flavours come through & are followed up by some resinous pine too; the taste is definitely a good one with faint touches of caramel towards the end too.  Smooth, medium body that is really bitter. There's spice & faint hints of alcohol with some sweetness from the fruits and further bitterness closing things.  A very hoppy & bitter American IPA with plenty of fruits & hops coming through from the start, almost overpowering you at times but the taste is still a good one. Definitely one worth picking up but there are better out there as well.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,BEERchitect,4.21,"Devilishly deliciousness is what comes from the depths of Pennsylvanian brewing to reward all area hop-heads with a sharp and citrusy bitterness, backed by the malty tendencies that give east-coat IPA their uniqueness.  Its deep amber hue foreshadows its malt balance just as the sweetness hits the tongue and its savory and crusted aromas begin to satisfy the savory seeking senses. But the quick rebuttal from hops suggest a stern counter taste with its own grapefruit, orange and pine flavor.  And with those graham cracker and caramel sweetnesses smolder underneath, the middle palate shifts to hop flavor. Its sharp and acidic flavors of pink grapefruit, ripe orange peels and sappy pine needles frame a hop dominance to command the beer's taste thereafter.  As the malt continues its decline, the hops turn deeply resinous and bitter- cleaning the taste and drying it simultaneously. Its mild warmth is hidden by hop flavor as the ale concludes with peppery bite and a pep of ginger.  Unlike many of the more ""West Coast"" varieties, Victory Hop Devil targets hop-heads with a sensibility for balance. A delightful taste for any hop lover.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

A smooth and creamy off-white colored head sits on top and leaves behind some consistent spots of lacing with each sip.  S — Smell is quite bitter, piney, dusty almost, a light bready base as well.  T — Starts nice enough with notes of lemon, pine, earth, and citrus, as it warms and is consumed a real acrid bitterness forms and becomes a bit of a distraction to the rest of the flavors.  M — Medium bodied, smooth, easy drinking sans the extreme bitterness.

Caramel and some pine, but not much.  t. This is different. The IPA concentrates more on the traditional Ale aspect. The hops are there, but nothing like wolf. They are a part of the whole as opposed to being over the top hop.  m. Mouthfeel is good. Easy to drink with a bit of a bite in the back of the throat on the finish - subtle.  o. outstanding. falls just outside my current top 5, but will revisit when given the chance.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Fear4Beer,3.76,"I'm not a fan of hoppy beer. There I said it. But I still want to try them out to change my perception of them. I had an IPA so hoppy, bitter, and similar to a pine cone that I decided not to try them for a while (I think it was Sierra Nevada's Torpedo).  This beer definitely has hops galore but without a mountain of bitterness. Is there bitterness? Yes absolutely, but I've experiences much worse. Was there a pine taste to it? Yes, unfortunately there was but it wasn't overwhelming.  For an IPA this is pretty nice and I like the price of $1.79 per bottle. But as a beer I'd rank this beer low since I'm not a fan of IPAs. I hear of these mythical fruit and hoppy beers... maybe I'd be into those. Too much pine and bitters, but maybe that's all they will ever be. Meh. I just don't understand how people can pretend to like beers like this.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Coagulater,4.63,"I have had a lot of IPAs ... This one never fails to deliver everthing an IPA should. I'll skip all the over analysis and get right to it: one of my all time favorite IPAs.

Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass (thought this was style appropriate). 1 1/2 fingers of slightly off-white head (diminished down to about 1, decent retention). Clear, darkish amber color... good looking beer. Medium one the nose, some hints of lemon, definitely some pine, smells 'clean' overall (reminiscent of the 'clean' smell of DirtWolf; at least to me), maybe just a hint of the 'homebrew keg' smell... but just a hint. Tastes were on point. Bright, resiny pine freshness off the bat, bit of citrus on the back end... not overly malty. Crisp and refreshing to the tastebuds. Overall, a nice refreshing, light to medium-bodied mouthfeel, good carbonation, again very refreshing on the palate. Nice beer. This is a keeper, and I am sure it will find its way into my fridge every once in a while (especially when the dates are right!).",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Reviewed from notes. have had many times before, but only rated.  hazy deep amber coloring with a very nice white head and persistent lacing.  Nice aroma of hops and a very good maltiness.  Had this many times before, and it hits this particular palate very nicely. The hops are prominent, but it also has a great solid malt background, which, as a Brit who sometimes likes a good balance, is appreciated.  Feel is a tad over medium, finish is slightly bitter.

345,1005,JohnMalone,4.41,This nitro version of the well known and loved classic Hop Devil is outstanding. I'm a big fan of Guinness so I love the pour and have no problem waiting for it to 'cook'.

345,1005,rawfish,4.15,"Pours clear deep amber, striking for an IPA with a sepia head, rocky, 2 and a half digits high. Brilliant rings of lacing down the glass.  Nose is a bit muted but a good waft of citrus and grapefruit hops with a solid malty backing and a spicy note. The malt bill here is in full force, reminds me alot of a hoppy American red ale.  Even with the ever evolving world of IPAs changing perception of taste it's still a assault of hops on the palate. Not hugely bittering but large amounts of tart grapefruit and pine resin. The malts are a big player, caramel, bready and a solid balance, somewhat spicy. Dries rather well despite the darker malts.  Good carbonation and body, the malts kept a bit of sticky sweetness on the finish, I think this could finish a little crisper and less grainy.  Despite its presence in the Victory line-up for such a long time it's still extraordinary, I'll take it when I can find it.

This one seems more like an amber than a pale. Finger and a half off white head. Good retention. Good lacing. Carbonation is moderate.  S: Very bready in the nose. Dark, biscuity quality. Hops are present, leading to a slight floral edge with a big shot of fruitiness. Mostly stone fruit, with some berry characteristics.  T: Starts off with the rich copper malts. Again, doughy and biscuity like. Hops take over mid palate and shoot up a quick. Big burst of key lime and kumquat. Finishes with a nice, almost peppery/ginger note that carries through into the aftertaste. Takes a turn for the resinous, but the malt balances it wonderfully. Hints of lemon and pine in the finish. The malts give the citric taste an almost candied quality. Finishes fairly dry, and amazingly fruity.  M: Medium bodied. Carbonation is in no way distracting. Even comes off as slightly creamy.  O: Very, very good. I think I still prefer the hop monster west coast IPA's, but this one can hold its own with anybody. Great nose and truly exceptional flavor.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,theIPAman,4.06,"An interesting IPA. Pours darker and amber like a red ale. Some fruit hops but more bready and malty grains than others of the style.

We'll worth a try and a solid overall offering.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Beer poured an amber-orange with not much of a head but the clarity is spot on.  Not catching a whole lot of hop power as this is mostly biscuity with some citrus.  In the world of IPA's which most are west coast hop monsters this one is balanced, as far as an IPA can be. Caramel and biscuity malts are prevelant at the start. Citrus, pine, and a hint of mango meld nicely with the malt base. Pine tar lingers on the palate just to let you know this is an IPA.

Not much else....did I mention citrus? lol  Taste- A dual blast of malt and hops. The initial malt blast is somewhat of a toasty bread character. The hops remain through the whole flavor profile until a spicy hot finish. Notes of grapefruit along with hints of sweet caramel too. Wickedly complex.  Mouthfeel- Heavy body of which is thick and creamy.  Overall- A solid example of a great IPA. This was the first craft beer I tried years ago so maybe it has a sentimental impression on me, but nevertheless, it is damn good if you dont mind a complex bitter blast.

Hints of pine, lime, and tangerine, but overall more earthy than citric or sprucey. Guessing they used more than the ""C"" hops here. Really nice caramel malt underbody.

345,1005,Auraan,4.24,"Poured a rich, clear reddish amber with a thin ring of fluffy off-white head. It looks quite nice, though more head formation would be nice. Scents of sweet malt and abundant floral hops upfront, aromas of honey and jasmine are also present, as well as some earthy notes and fainter notes of citrus and pine. Quite well rounded and appealing, very well done aroma in the East Coast style. Flavor begins with a big burst of floral hops and hop bitterness, as well as some caramel malt sweetness backing the hops. In the middle and finish more pine resin flavor comes out, alongside some citrus peel, still backed by a modest level of caramel malt. The finish is mostly pine resin and a bit of caramel malt. Aftertaste is bitter pine resin, floral flavors and grainy malt. The flavor profile is quite nice and balances hop bitterness with malt sweetness quite well. Very fitting for an East Coast IPA and quite nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation and a slightly sticky and resinous mouthfeel. It is quite easy to drink and very pleasant. Overall this is a good East Coast IPA. It has the aroma, flavor and mouthfeel I expect from the sub-style and it matches quite well with, though not quite as good as, Bell's Two Hearted.

345,1005,gr0g,3.9,"Decidedly not pale, but copper in color. A nice, two-finger head forms, with good retention and some sexy lacing. Aroma features mostly herbal and grassy notes along with a solid toffee note. As an IPA that's been around a while, the great aromas lent by ""new school"" hops are not present.  On the palate there's more balance between malt and hops than many IPAs. Still, perceived bitterness is in IPA territory and there are some nice, though vague hoppy flavor notes. Despite the maltiness, the flavor is dry. Pronounced citric hop bite. The soft, fine carbonation works very well.  This really blurs the line between IPA and an amber/red ale due to the balance between the strength of the hop flavors and the malt body (plus it's got an amber color). Hop Devil ultimately stands out as a malt-forward IPA that's quite good, if not quite a stand-out in an increasingly crowded market.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

There is definitely some toasty caramel present, but it takes a backseat to the pine, grapefruit and lemon peel. Not that impressed with the quality of flavors in the hop profile, but it's well balanced so it works. Just on the light side of medium-bodied, with smooth crisp carbonation.

Juicy citrus fruit presence with hints of grapefruit, orange peel, lemon, pineapple, and tangerine. Solid sweet malt backing with hints of caramel, grains, biscuit, cracker, and yeast.

Upfront mix of hop flavors with earthy notes of grass and pine resin. Citrus hop notes of grapefruit, orange pulp, lemons, mango, tangerine, and pineapple. Good malt balance with notes of sweet caramel, grains, cracker, biscuit, and yeast. Nicely juicy and drying. A very solid IPA taste.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Juicy and slightly oily and sticky. Finishes dry and smooth.  Overall: A very solid American IPA. Good juicy hop notes with a nice caramel malt backbone.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Bone53,4.31,"Served from a bottle into a snifter at about 45°F  Appearance: Darker than most IPAs. Amber red with a one finger off white head. You can tell that they probably used a good amount of malts in this one.  Smell: Citrus grapefruit, caramel malts, spices. Intriguing  Taste: Similar to the smell. Nice balance between citrus hops, caramel malts, and spices. Complex  Mouthfeel: Creamy, smooth, full mouthfeel for an IPA and not overwhelmingly bitter like a lot of IPAs are guilty of.  Overall: Hop Devil stands out in the IPA world. It's unique in its own way with a healthy amount of malts and spices. An excellent example of an East Coast IPA. Not among my absolute favorites in the style, but a great go to as I reside in PA. Cheers!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Aroma was pine and maybe some citrus. Taste is more complex than aroma. Slight malt in background. Hops front and center. Pine grapefruit and more green notes are predominant.

345,1005,lochef81,4.04,"My first experience with Victory. From the first moment with this ale it is clear that it is not your typical American ipa. It pours a deep red amber color with a thick deep cream head that lasts well into the beer. And leaves a thick lacing of off white foam. The aroma is very complex and not reminiscent of most hop heavy ipas. There is a strong presence of malts, some coffee and caramel notes. There are also citrus and pine notes but they are subtle in relativity to the malt. It is very complex and unexpected fir such an unassuming ipa. The flavor is very similar. Im beginning to well respect the east coast for their very complex and deep ipas. Not just the single note hoppy ipas if the west coast.

Nice rich amber color although a bit cloudy. Thick sticky head gets extra points.  Pine and citrus on the nose as you would expect, but kinda subdued...def not overpowering. An off note mixed in as well.  Something missing on the palate...not sure what it is. Game on bitterness with punch and hop loaded for sure but its missing a level of complexity seen in other competing brews of the same style. This is definitely a well crafted and tasty beer, but falls just short of the top tier for the style.

A: Nice clear amber color with a slight off white head. Aggressive pour into a pint glass drives a 1 1/2 inch head. Slowly dissipates and leaves solid lacing on the glass. S: Slightly less hoppy aroma than I expected. I pick up some mild citrus and pine notes. T: Nice! there's the hops I've been craving. Minimal malt flavor in the back ground. M: Nice solid mouth feel, not chewy, with a solid bitter tang on the tongue. O: A very drinkable IPA.

Hints of citrus and just a faint hint of hops.  T Taste certainly does not mirror the smell. Very hoppy. Right of front and thick and lingering at the back end. In between there is caramel/malt tinge of sweetness.  M Full for the style. Has backbone. Creamier than most IPAs. Finish is rough, but not bad, due to the bitterness.  O Pretty good if not a bit inconsistent. It is bitter and hoppy. I like that. However, there just seems to be something lacking. I am not talking balance. I don't need equal malt in an IPA. There just doesn't seem to be any complexity of mixture of flavors. I wish I could put my finger on it, but it's just lacking. Not bad at all, but just seems that it could be much better.

The aroma is very clean and grassy. The hops smell is very citrusy like an under ripe orange. There's also a real sent of apple like esters in there. The taste follows the scent well but the fruitiness and malt flavors, which has a little honey to it, only really come through in the after taste, after the hops have had there time to wage war on your mouth.

Lots of pine, juniper, smoke, and salt in that hop flavor.  M: Smooth and easy drinking, even with the emergence of hop flavor at the end. Leaves you smacking your lips as the sweet and spice elements mingle.  O: A very drinkable (even sessionable) IPA. Like their brethren on the West Coast, Victory has put its unique stamp on the style. What’s most impressive to me is how approachable this beer is.

The aroma has a nice earthy and piney hop sensation along with some spice and toasted pale malts but there is also a kind of buttery sensation in there that I cannot quite explain.

345,1005,LambicPentameter,3.53,"Enjoyed out of a 12 oz brown bottle with an ""enjoy by"" date of Nov 28, 2013 etched into bottle near the neck. Poured into the IPA-specific glass from Speigelau. Consumed on 11/20, so this review is written from my tasting notes and photos.  Appearance - Standard pour yields a rocky beige two-finger head with significant pocking as the bubbles slowly start to burst. Retention is excellent, and when the foam does start to recede, it leaves ample sheets of lacing with sparse gaps. The body is a deep ruby amber color, with notes of maroon and burgundy, and an orange skin colored highlight where the light passes through.  Smell - Malted grain, molasses, caramel malt and a healthy dose of hop characteristics from both the earthy and citrus sides of the aroma family. However, I can't help wonder if the aroma would be a little more pungent (in a good way) if I wasn't consuming this bottle a mere week from the ""best by"" date. As it is, the grain bill is the headliner to me.  Taste - Here, the malt is more present, with notes of burnt caramel, brown sugar, fresh pumpernickel, and yet somehow so are the hops. The taste is more aggressive on both fronts than the smell was. Grapefruit and citrus zest, although they are subdued, likely from the time passed between bottling and opening. Either way, this is a very balanced IPA, rather than a hop bomb. Not to my preference, but well within the style.  Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied with some light chewiness and carbonation level that is fairly low, but still detectible and enough to provide a consistent head throughout the enjoyment of the beverage. Semisweet finish.  Overall, a solid brew, but not one I'm likely to go out of my way to grab again. That being said, I tend towards the more West Coast style IPAs, so this one just isn't to my personal preference. However, I would encourage anyone who is a fan of big, meaty IPAs to pick up a bottle.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Starts with a funky hop smell, but improves from there. Light carbonation and a swell bitterness that makes me wonder why this beer smells differently than it tastes.

Malty toward the finish with a bitter, dry finish.  Mouthfeel: Excellent! Full bodied, very well carbonated and light enough to be refreshing.

The carbonation is medium. The astounding aspect of this beer is that the hop flavor is so well counter balanced but it's still strongly pleasant that makes me wonder why I haven't tried more IPAs  O: excellent beer, again, not my beer style preference, but if more IPAs are built with this level of complexity, I might have to branch out",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

First sip is delicious with a drier finish than one might expect. I like an IPA that's lip-smacking wet. This isn't quite that. Overall: Out of the many options at the liquor store, I find myself regularly buying this beer.

The maltiness is over-powering to me, and it puts all of the other flavors on the back burner. There is some nice citrus flavor though. Mouth: Medium carbonation with a med ium body.

Other bottles in the sixpack say enjoy by 1/16/14, and since Victory recommends drinking them within five months, they would have been bottled 8/16/13, about two and a half months ago.  Original 9/15/13 review of another bottle purchased earlier: Poured from the 12 oz. bottle into a Sierra Nevada IPA glass a: Clear amber with a huge and stubborn 2 inch tall off white head which eventually receded to very heavy surface foam and extensive even lacing. Awesome! s: Caramel! Unusual! t: Bitter hops over very distinctively dark caramel malt with strong coffee undertones! Breakfast IPA, anyone? Coffee tones did tend to decline near the end, but left a slightly bitter aftertaste towards the entire back of the tongue. Refreshingly heavy carbonation. m: Medium. Blindfolded, I might mistake this for a light breakfast stout! o: A most unusual IPA, and one I need to try again to confirm this bizarre but very enjoyable profile. My experience seems quite different from other recent reviews described below. I did not get either the citrus or overpowering hops, but rather caramel/coffee under moderate hops.. I loved it as it was, Definitely will buy more to see if that's how my palate reports it again. Original ratings were a:5 s:4.75 t:4.75 m:4.25 o:4.75  NEW REVIEW 10/27/13: Poured from the 12 oz. bottle into a Sierra Nevada IPA glass a: Clear amber with a huge and stubborn 2 inch tall off white head which eventually receded to even surface foam film and some semi-patterned lacing. s: Pine t: Very hops dominant, light malt underneath. Bitterness lingers on the tongue. m: Moderate with good body. Quite smooth, o: Excellent IPA, bordering on a double and might pass for such.  UPDATE 9/19/16: three years later, best by date is Nov. 1, so probably at least three months old, ancient in IPA terms. But everything in the above review still goes, only our tastes have changed thanks to the many ""juicy New England style"" IPAs which have come onto the market as opposed to the primarily piney/spicy ones like this which now tend to be known as ""California style."" Would accordingly lower the ratings to bring them more personally up to date, but not by much, so won't bother at this point, Hop Devil still lives up to its name, and it's still enjoyable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

I was expecting a stronger nose given the style. What I did smell was very pleasant in a subtle way. I had to sniff it a few times to get a good olfactory reading. Nice. Almost no head. Rapid disappearance. Nice carbonation. Small, lightly populated trails of bubbles reaching the surface. Nice sticky lacing lasting till the end of the glass. This beer has a wonderful and interesting flavor. It does not come on as strong as many IPAs and yet as it lingers on your tongue you taste more and more flavors that entice you to raise the glass to your lips again. I definitely like this beer. If you are hesitant to drink an AIPA, try this one. A very pleasingly-smooth presentation of this style. Worth storing a few.

Sticky lace is left behind, circling the pint in rings.  S - Strong floral hops greet the olfactory right away and are backed by juicy tropical fruit notes and a faint hint of pine. Robust maltiness balances the hop-leaning aroma with toast and brown breadiness for an inviting nose.  T - Chewy caramel-drizzled warm, thickly sliced bread has a stranglehold on the beer but is briefly dethroned by smooth floral hops with a citrus, tropical fruit bite and earthy pine finish.  M - HopDevil's bolder maltiness gives the beer a heavier feel with sharp carbonation and dry hoppiness coming in on the bitter finish.  O - HopDevil is decidedly hoppy with plenty of floral, citrus, and pine notes and a bitter finish but the hops seem to do more work balancing against the big malt body of the beer rather than the other way around but, HopDevil remains a powerful beer regardless.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

The hops are more floral, earthy, piney and onions. I smelled orange at times, even a bit of lemon but the floral hops hold closer to the front.  The flavors are spot on the scent as I catch a heavy rye malt. The hops are certainly at the front with earth tones, pine, chive, and even lemon. The rye subsides a bit and gives off a caramel malt finish.  This is a very good IPA, with flavors bouncing all over the place, but I think that it is simply my palate that enjoys the overwhelming fruit that this does not provide.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,Knox_Worrell,4.59,First bottle of this ever and all I can say is WOW.  Appearance: Least impressive thing about this beer. Not much head but that doesn't always reflect on the quality of the beer.  Smell: This is what an IPA should smell like. Permeates a rich and sweet hoppy aroma with a hints of caramel malt and wheat barley  Taste: Is a little offsetting at first because of the rich notes of Wheat and Earthy Hops but grows quickly as the glass empties. A little more bitter than your regular IPA. Caramel is very tasteful in its presence and complements the wheat/hops taste. Think I tasted a hint of Vanilla but maybe I'm dreaming. Still the best IPA taste-wise I've had.  Mouthfeel: Delightfully smooth and elegant. Very swishable but yet a beer you want to drown in.  Overall: Victory does know how to brew an IPA. This is a rich and hoppy brew that will be a constant favorite. Not necessarily a novice IPA but that is probably a good thing. The Caramel tones are second to no other IPA.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

It is more malty and bready, with hints of sweet fruit like apricot or blueberry.  Taste is complex and pleasant. There is more of a malt component on the front end, and it transitions toward bitterness after the swallow. Hops and bitterness linger into the aftertaste, and there is also a bread-like component to the aftertaste.  MF is silky and moderately carbonated. Medium bodied.  Overall this is a pretty good beer. If you like an American IPA with plenty of malt in the backbone, you will like this. I was a little surprised, based on the namesake, that this beer was not a clear showcase of hops in both the aroma and taste. IMO they did not stand out any more than the malt.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,dougbassett,4.36,"One of the ""1001 Beers You Must Taste Before You Die"" -- #34 of the ones I've reviewed here.  Well, this is a modern classic, from what's probably the best brewery (at least in my opinion) in the Philadelphia area -- which is a great area for beer all around. It's one of the standout American IPA's being produced.  Gets the pour pretty much perfect -- an enviable reddish gold with a head that lingers substantially. The nose is a blast of citrusy/lemon hops with just enough with just enough bitter grassiness from the hops to give the nose a bit of backbone -- it's not just pure lemon.  The mouthfeel is near perfect, it's brewed at a certain density to stand up to all the flavors here. And make no doubt, there's a lot of flavor here: this is (as you might expect, I guess) a hop showcase. I don't know if I'd call it especially deep, it's a pretty basic strong American hop presence, but it's a long, deep solid blast of it, is the thing. And just when you finish up the swallow a sneaky little finish skirts around and gives you an echo of what you just swallowed. Really exceptionally well constructed beer.  One of the best of the beers I've reviewed here, I don't know if it's my favorite American IPA but it's certainly in the running. A must-try, and I suspect on draft (I've never had it on draft) even better.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

The taste is where this beer shines. It starts off like an orange zest, then moves to some floral notes and finally finishes with a bready side.

Popping the top I get a very complex aroma of molasses but not much hops, odd referencing the name. Pours to a red golden color with a pillow foamy beige two finger head. On the taste the complexity continues, this brew is almost imperial ipa-esque in its existence. The taste starts thick and syrupy with an apparent high ABV, it the transitions into nice deep hop kick with a yet strong malted background. The finish is a growing bitter aftertaste that yearns another sip. A great selection from Victory.

This beer has incredible balance, and really easy to drink. Has a solid caramel backbone that works well to sweeten up the bitter grapefruits to balance out everything. Some minor citric fruits like orange and cherry also are noticeable.  Mouthfeel - From first sip, tongue gets the hoppy fruits and malts. Palate gets more of the same along with some spices and sugary fruits. The aftertaste is grapefruity, malty and sweet.  Drinkabilty - I recommed this beer to everyone. It has plenty of flavor, just enough hop kick, nice smooth malts, and light alcohol at the finish. Balance is amazing, drinks very easy and very affordable. This is a classic example of a beer that gets overlooked cause its been around for awhile, made year round, and is always avaible around here.

345,1005,mfnmbvp,3.55,"12 oz. bottle, with no apparent bottled on date present. It's been a long time coming since I've last had this beer, over a year now at least. I'm interested to see what I think of it now after all that time, since I remember enjoying it. Poured into a Firestone Walker pint glass.  A - Pours a coppery burnt sienna orange colored body with about a finger of doughy khaki colored head. Some thin wispy cavernous lacing.  S - Smell is of amber malts, breadiness, some cream, metallic / copper presence, and a dirty herbal earthy hoppiness. Definitely not the fruity hop bomb that I usually expect from an IPA nowadays. Has that nasty dirty sock sort of smell that I sometimes find.  T - Taste follows the nose: sweet grainy maltiness, white bread, a metallic coppery mineral crispness, and a dirty earthy twiggy hop presence. More malt forward than hop bitterness, I'd say. Some spicy hop bitterness is present and some sugary green apple skin sweetness in the finish.  M - Feel is crisp, carbonated, dry, and bitter with sticky overripe green apple skin.  Overall, not my ideal American IPA. Way more malt forward than I like my IPA's, and definitely not as bitter as I thought it once was. Perhaps it would be a good starter IPA for people new to the style. A good beer, but not one I would actively seek out.

While there is a fairly pungent herbal and orange peel hop side, what seems to me like Vienna or Munich bready malt has a large role in the aroma.  Flavor is a rich, thick, bitter orange peel, like orange marmalade on very grainy bread.  Full and bordering on roughly bitter. Carbonation stands up to this.

345,1005,rickyleepotts,3.97,"This is our last beer from Victory. I landed this beer in a trade since Victory beers are not distributed out here. We could easily get them in Indiana, but Indiana is a lot closer to Pennsylvania than Arizona. I am a big fan of this brewing company, too. I didn't realize the guy behind it were beer nerds and studied beer in Germany. I hope this beer stacks up.  I have had this before, but not in a long time. I think the last time I had this was in Indianapolis at a beer festival. Oh, and I love the label. The little hop devil… cute!  In the Glass: The beer, for being an American IPA, has a nice creamy head. The lace is really nice, too. I would use the word, ""sticky"" to explain the lace. The beer is also quite cloudy. Makes me think of an unfiltered wheat beer. Maybe that is the German training these brewers had. Let's see what she smells like.  Nose: There is a ton of orange zest on this one. The tasting notes mentioned a lot of pine, but I am not getting much, if any, pine here. That's good, because it's hot outside. I like nice citrus forward beers during the hot summer months. Save pine for the wintertime. Well, the 65 degrees we get here in the desert! There might be a hint of pine there, but the sweetness of the malts really tames it down. Let's see what she tastes like.  Flavor: There is more pine on the palate. A lot more pine. The beer also has a weird mouthfeel, but we will get to that. The flavor profile doesn't really match the aroma whatsoever. That's not a bad thing, as that allows you to experience a wide range of hop character in a single bottle. I haven' had their lineup in a while, but I wonder if all their beers have a similar hop profile. Think Stone Brewing Company.  Mouthfeel: Flat. If I didn't know any better, I would say this beer was flat. It's not, but it has a very flat mouthfeel. I don't know what other words to use to describe it… it's not thin, but that is the word that comes to mind.  I will mention this beer is NOT right out of the fridge. I took this beer out and let it warm up a little. Some of the mouthfeel changes might be coming from that. I wonder if Sheryl noticed.  Aftertaste: The aftertaste also has a lot of pine in it. It is somewhat drying, and leaves me wanting another drink. The ABV on this bottle would allow me to drink 3 or 4 without even really taking note. Speaking of their other beers, their Storm King and Golden Monkey are two of their best beers. They also produce a weizen bock that I have never had. I am not sure I have even seen the bottle.  This is a good beer. For a basic IPA, I would totally put this in my rotation. It has just enough hop character to appease the hop head in me. Sheryl isn't a big fan of hops, but yesterday ordered the new Enjoy By from Stone. We were at Aces and Ales in Las Vegas celebrating my birthday, and they had the new one on tap. It was good; lots of fruity flavors.  If you like a good American IPA, give this one a shot. Cheers!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Generous head filled my Sam Adams pint glass to the very top and it retained well throughout, leaving thick lacing down the glass. Really nice presentation.  S - Followed the color of the beer. It was a darker, earthier smell. Fairly faint.  T - Follows the nose. I didn't detect much of the citrus that others seem to see. Mostly I just got the earthiness and a really well-done bittering sensation.  M - Nice medium-bodied. It hangs on to the tongue long enough to let the bitterness sink in, but not enough to make it an unwelcome guest. Relatively clean finish.

345,1005,VictorWisc,4.71,"Poured into 10 oz Leviathan glass.  Pours clear dark amber, almost cherrywood color, without any hint of cloudiness noted in other reviews. Plentiful soft cream-colored head, substantial lacing.  Citrus (orange), pine and fresh laurel on the nose, soon followed by malt and yeast notes. More esters than most IPAs. Distinct alcohol punch once the head recedes--perhaps the only negative.  A big mouthful of candied orange peel (basically a blend of orange rind and burnt sugar, but more complex) and pine, a lot of floral and herbal notes, cloves, laurel and green tea. Nice resinous bitterness rounds off the initial shot, then lingers in the mouth, complemented by developing malt note, slight acidity (likely from carbonation) and a hint of apricot. The yeast and alcohol less pronounced on the tongue than they are on the nose.  Medium body with distinct maltiness, but not syrupy or sweet. The beer is smooth, but does coat the back of the tongue, which helps to extend the finish. A bit boozy, but not overwhelmingly so. Carbonation is light to moderate, with fine structure, resulting in a slightly salty/minerally effervescence. A good balance between malt, yeast and hops, with the heat likely smoothing out with a couple more weeks of aging (if it came to that).  Overall a well-balanced, excellent IPA, even if its popularity might have waned a bit in the last decade. I would rate it exceptional (working on the fourth mixed 12 over the last two months, and have similar opinions of other contents). The interplay between hops and malt is simply beautiful, which likely means that it rates too malty for many hopheads. Heat is the only real downgrade. Obviously would buy it again... and again, and again...  PS: There is a distinct possibility that age plays a role in the reviewers' reaction, so I'll try to come back to it again after a few weeks.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Poured into a teku, this has seriously awesome creamy head for an ipa and it retains well. Most ipa's have head which dissipates, but not this beer. The color is deep amber, almost red, full of dancing bubbles. The scent at first is piney and spicy but halfway through mellows out and a deep jasmine scent dominates. Quite lovely really. Perfect carbonation: not too much, not too little. A mellow yet spicy and resin like taste which rounds out to slight bitterness lingering on the back of the tongue, maybe a bit grapefruit like?

One finger of white froth sticks to the glass in teeth-shaped streaks.  Slightly funky, spicy citrus. Grapefruit peel, caramel.  Same deal in the flavor, but more pronounced. Like an HD version of the nose. Bright, clear grapefruit, a bit of caramel and biscuit to back it up. Lingering bitter spice.  Medium body, high pinching carbonation is almost painful. Clean.

I would call it not so much copper but a light bronze  it smelled of hops, but with a sourdough bready aroma, with a slight aroma of pine needles coming in late. and a sweetness from the malts as the beer reached more towards room temperature.  you can taste the bitterness in your first sip, but then it disapates and comes back again as you swirl it in your mouth. you get a yeast full bready taste, also a slight sweetness from the malt  m- it has a rich full bodied feel with slight carbonation, you can definitely sense a high abv, but, not overpowering. wouldn't kick this beer out of the fridge, can drink it everyday.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Taste: Like the aromas, it has some citrus, floral notes, a bit of pine and sweet bready/caramelly malts to balance it out.

Super crisp, outstanding flavor of hops and citrus (especially big on the hops as the name would lead you to believe). Really nice copper color with a whitish foam head. Just enough boozy flavor to let you know it's there without getting into the range of an imperial or anyhting like that.

345,1005,SerialTicker,4.19,"*March 23rd review from RateBeer*  First off, this bottle says best by March 18th 2013, so it’s about a week past its prime.  Appearance: Pretty clear beer with some small particles floating around. Two fingers worth of head that stays at about one through the glass. Very nice lacing.  Aroma: The aroma is of spice and malt with hops there, but definitely in the background and more subtle (I presume because of the age of this beer).  Taste: The taste is... interesting. Truth be told, it tastes like V8 juice to me as far as the ""spice"" is concerned, but without any vegetable notes (thank God). Sweet through the front of each sip, with a slightly bitter, spicy finish. Really, I get a LOT of peppery notes in HopDevil, and I don’t mind. The mouthfeel is smooth, and a slight coating is left in the mouth on each sip.  HopDevil’s a very good beer, and this one’s not even fresh. I would try this again out of a fresher bottle.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Decent, but splotchy lacing. Smell - Earthy, piney, some grass. Biscuit, caramel malt is present. Taste - Hop forward with exceptional balance; this tastes like a perfect Fall IPA! Hops want to dominate, but malts come in to help settle it down. Hops eventually win out in the mouthfeel. Feel - an earthy bitterness paired nicely with caramel-like malt!

The aroma is of hop oil, flowers, some pine, and sweet, white bread. Taste is of all those, plus citrus rind, sugar, citrus juice of some sort, hearty (but, not harsh) bitterness, and no alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium, soft, and oily, and Victory Hop Devil IPA finishes mostly dry, refreshing, sweet, and quite drinkable. This is a super IPA, and I say it's one not to miss.

345,1005,damndirtyape,3.75,"On tap at Rosewood Grill, Hudson, OH. Served in a Shaker Pint Glass.  Appearance: Slightly hazy copper. Plenty of thick sheets of lacing and lots of persistent strands. Thin foam across the top (off white, slightly orangish) that lasted the whole way down the glass.  Smell: Herbal, slightly cheesy smell, odd, but this went away as it warmed up and the beer approaches room temp. At that point, the smell moves over to floral and citrus.  Taste: Very hoppy through and through. Bitter up front taste, moving into buttery caramel malt sweetness middle, and then more of a bitter finish. Bitterness had aspects of pine and grapefruit.  Mouthfeel: Nicely thick, good carbonation to counter it. Hop oils sticking to the teeth.  Overall / Drinkability: A good AIPA, but not a great one. The aroma makes wonder if this one had been in the keg a bit too long (it had been awhile since they changed out the keg). By itself nice, but not wow.

I'm getting a touch of grass and dirt in here as well.  T: It starts out sweet and malty with a bit of pine hops coming on a second or so later. As the beer moves into the middle I get butter, and dirt. This beer is definitely old. Too bad.  M: Medium bodied beer. It has some heft, it's coats the palate, and it lingers for awhile after the beer is gone.  O: I wish this beer wasn't an old bottle.

So, consider I was in PA, just arrived in the states, figured this would satisfy my IPA needs.  Poured a rusty copper color, thin white head.  Nose; floral hops, bready malts, that's about it.  Taste; way too much malt character. Overpowered what little hoping there was. Now, I know this was served in an airport (thankfully in a Sam Adams perfect pint by my request) but wow, this beer is not at all what I remember. Could have been a freshness issue but I don't really think so considering I was in it's home state and from what I would guess, international airports serving local beer should be running through the stuff fairly often so the keg couldn't have been that old.

Smell: Prominent grapefruit hop, very spicy. Spiciness is dominant in a good way, with background balance of sweet malts and bready, biscuity aroma. Clean, welcoming IPA.  Taste: initial hop intensity. Original in being spicy, stinging and salty. Earthy grass flavors start, then followed by distinct spiciness. Way in background there's sweet toasty malt with bready and honey flavors. Provides a strong finish of stinging, refreshing, hops. All the precarious, see-saw balance and spiciness make it a great food beer (tonight with burritos and provolone and mozzarella) (NJ Mexican).  Mouthfeel: Refreshing, full body, smooth and creamy with a maltiness tone  one of my favorite american IPAs, sure to please. On the stinging, spicy, tingling hop forward end of the spectrum.

Slight floral and citrus notes, mainly grapefruit and sharp malts.  HopDevil serves as a great departure from my steady stream of IPAs. It's hoppy, but well balanced with intelligent use of malts making it bold and unique with bitterness, but refined with lasting finish. Your mouth will feel and taste this beer long after you're done drinking it.  If you like over-the-top pale ales, this is not the beer for you. It is, however, a great example of Victory's boldness in producing a unique, hop-heavy beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,ChugMan,4.14,"A - Orange gold body with some bubbles. Fluffy head settled to thin layer which left some really wonderful lacing. S - Soft but thick sweetness, very much like strawberries and cream oatmeal or cereal. Light spice as well. T - Some nice floral flavors here, and also a very fresh citrus flavor as well, sweet grapefruit and clementine orange. Maltyness gives just enough definition to the body to smoothly tie it all together. Definitely tastes fresh and authentic, nothing forced. Gives the nose a lot to think about! M - Fairly steep bitterness throughout the mouth giving that citrusy rind sensation. Not quite as potent as I was expecting, as it still goes down pretty easy. That bitterness sure isn't going anywhere soon though, so hop-haters beware! O - This is a good beer. Really nice floral and fruit flavors, just missing some of the wow factor I was hoping for given the name.

Drinks fairly clean and finishes crisp and hearty at the same time.  M: light-to-medium, good carbonation, leaves a rich bitter coat - very lively - evaporates  O: a very well-done beer.

Long retention for what is there. Amber-honey color with high clarity. Sudsy lacing up the sides. Decent looking brew. Wish the head was nicer though.  S- Slightly funky citrusy and pine. Some sweet malts, but mostly the aromatic and earthy hop character. Honey, grapefruit, pine.  T- Spicy and earthy hops with a caramel malt backbone. Strong citrus and hop acid. IBUs must be relatively high on this badboy. Good flavor, not a smack in the face while still being bitter.  M- Medium bodied, sticky and dry. Great feel.  O- Honestly let down a little.

345,1005,57md,4.25,"Did some back-to-back sampling of the regular tapped version and the nitro-tapped version. The scores apply to the higher of the two versions - which in this case is the regular.  Appearance is copper with almost a finger of head that lingered a bit and left nice lacing on the glass. The nose is a potent combination of hops and grapefruits. There is an excellent blend of malt and hops upfront with a hop bitterness on the finish that ranks with the best single IPAs out there.  This is an East Coast IPA all the way, and a damn fine example of one if I might say so!  The nitro version made for an interesting sample, but I would not want to drink Hop Devil this way more than once. Of course, the head is fluffier by far and the ""rings"" that are most often identified with nitro stouts appear on the glass as this offering goes down. That said, the best parts of an IPA are sadly muted by the nitro. The nose is nearly non-existent and the bitterness is curbed to the point of boredom. It certainly was smooth and creamy, but I am not sure I fancy smooth, creamy IPAs.

Present but not overwhelming caramel malt flavors.  Full, creamy mouthfeel on this one- very interesting for an IPA. Well carbonated.

It still holds up, though.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

So cool to tame the bitterness of the hops w/the nitro and still remain damn tasty. Killer w/the gorganzola burger, too.  Bottle w/drink by date of 06/13.  Nice amber in the glass w/decent lacing. A very nice looking beer.  The nose is a bit perfumey. The hops are there, but, it's got a lilac & hop combo thing.  The flavors are pretty standard IPA - hoppy and bitter and not much else. Lacks any interesting factor and fairly one dimensional.  Overall - I'd recommend to someone who has never had an IPA and wants to try a basic, no-frills beer w/the two basic components of the India Pale Ale - hops and bitterness.

Good visibility with mediocre retention and lacing. Aroma of spicy malts with a strong malt base. Orange and other citrus rind meld with some floral notes and alcohol, pretty balanced here. Taste follows the nose well, upfront spicy hop with a sturdy malted backbone. Not much of the floral or citrus notes translate well to the palate, leaving much of the flavor cut and dry hop and malt. The two balance each other well, but leave the overall flavor pretty bland- not much complexity. Feel is solid, dry and sticky, easy to drink with well concealed alcohol. Overall this beer is good in a balanced sense, however living on the west coast I'm used to my ipas ridiculously over hopped and citrusy, not something I get with this beer.

Aroma has a strong grapefruit and pine hop presence (though I've smelt more ferocious than this). Flavor matches the aroma--hops, hops, and more hops.

Quite inviting thus far.  T- Sweet caramel malt upfront, balanced with a citrusy hop bite. Finishes with slightly bitter pine notes. I get a surprising cappuccino note on the aftertaste.

I really had to swirl this around in my glass to detect the aromas. Overall I thought this where HopDevil was the most lacking. That said I was able to pick up notes of caramel, grapefruit, and that yeasty ester aroma. Again, I had to work hard for that. This was a fairly complex beer. Up front I tasted bitterness that reminded me of burnt toast. I also picked up some caramel and a nice touch of grapefruit citrus. It seems to me to be a little more complex than many other IPAs. It's medium bodied and has a nice crispness to it. Bitter malt and hop flavors change to citrus before a nice clean finish with almost no aftertaste. I'm not opposed to that resinous hop aftertaste but this is also nice. This is a quality beer that is very reasonably priced and easy to acquire.

S - Not quite as floral as the other versions, as nitro blends can hinder the aromatics of an IPA. I definitely detect a serious hop resume though  T - It tastes like the east coast IPA that I know and love, but wait...there's something more...a little extra biscuity...the nitro allows a little bit more of the maltiness to come through on this one...mmmm  M - It feels awesome in my mouth! It has the drinkability of water in a desert...goes down very smooth and the ABV can catch up to you so be careful!!  O - A great beer overall! It's much more sessionable as a nitro than CO2 and you can really pick up on the characteristics of the German malts that are being used.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

S - Smell is of toasted caramel malts, faint notes of orange peel, and lots of floral/spicy hops  T - Taste is a great blend of floral, spicy hops, with just enough balancing toasted caramel malt and toffee notes. There are some faint citrus notes, but this one is mostly floral/spicy. I'm also getting some herbal notes in the finish. Really nice and well balanced here.  M - Body is spot on, registering in medium territory. Carbonation keeps this beer lively, but easily drinkable.  O - Overall, this is a pleasant IPA to get your hands on if you see it.

It's incredible, and it stays on the palate for a while. Taste is dominated by this hop flavor. Some citrus notes and a nice malt sweetness complement it very well. You can also taste the alcohol quite clearly, but it's not unpleasant or overwhelming.  Mouthfeel: It's very smooth and creamy. Medium-bodied and surprisingly easy to drink, despite the hop ""kick"" you get at the beginning. It has a decent amount of carbonation.  Overall: This beer does the name justice. The mix of flavors, dominated by the citrus and spice hoppy taste is an incredible experience, even though it kicks your palate's ass. A brew every hop-head should try. But even people who don't like the hop bitterness, but appreciate beer, will be pleased by the complexity of the flavor and the feeling you get from it. Highly recommended.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Just on the nose alone, you know this one will be good. Tastes great! Terrific presence of the malt early, and then replaced by a nice and strong hop hit, all busy and everything, and sustain of the hops lasts at least five minutes. Great after-follow here, on the bitterness I mean. Wow. Mouthfeel is foamy-creamy and high and roiling but soft and not at all scrubbing. A terrific experience from front to back.

Poured a honey, caramel amber color with about two fingers of khaki white head. No lacing on the sides of the glass on the way down and below average retention on the tops.  Smelled big whiff of floral hops up front with a bit of a caramel malty finish. Also got light notes of citrus hops (lemon and, even less so, grapefruit), wet cascade hops and pine. Maybe even a bit of rye in there. Not much bitterness on the nose.  Tasted similar to the nose, but within even more malts and more bitterness. Hops seemed to be dominated by cascade hops, but also citrus (light lemon, grapefruit and orange) and some pine late on the tongue. Still got some rye and also some iced tea. Malts were mainly caramel.  Light-to-medium body. Oily-to-creamy texture. Lively (above average) carbonation. Long, bitter finish.  An OK IPA if you like the maltier kinds.

Taste is bitter hops with a slight sweetness of creamy caramel maltiness and notes of banana. Well balanced in that it is a bitter brew with a touch of sweetness. There is not a lot of complexity to the hops, some notes of fruit and citrus rinds. Fruit notes are subtle hints of pear and pineapple. There is a nice roasted flavor to the malts, which lends strength to the bitterness. Subtle bitter aftertaste, reminiscent of an orange peel.

Head disappears into a very thin layer that is then non-existent. Some bubbles.  Aroma: Earthy, grassy and piney hops. A very well balanced malt backbone. Oily and aromatics hops are well intertwined with malts and present a nice smelling brew. Some of the better aroma in normal IPAs.  Taste: The brew shines here. Strikes a very good balance between malts and hops. But in the end hop dominate and make it worthy. Bitterness is very well hidden but still makes its impact. Pernicious weed. After taste is all hops and bitter. Some malts upfront.  Mouth feel: Oily and aromatic yet malty and balancing. Bitter finish. Low to moderate carbonation. Medium feel.

345,1005,Ethanol4one,4.42,"The comic, eye catching label and name do not disappoint, as this beer delivers a big frothy head with strong citrus hops on the nose even out of the bottle. Almost seems like Tap beer out of the bottle... (well more than a certain stout with a certain storied can that injects nitro into it).  Hop Devil's orange, rusty color promises what it does in fact deliver on the malt side too, a light sweet, spiced backbone that keeps the high alcohol level beside the point. It also balanced well against the strong hop aromas and bitter hops to the taste. It has a light caramel flavor, but well in the background, like a chubby wall flower hiding out at the 8th grade prom.  I like it with spicy food because it steps right up and slaps the heat off your tongue-- like a boss; so if you're thinking of take out at the ethnic restaurant, this could be the tonic to wash it back.

345,1005,TheSSG,3.48,"Pours a big, off-white, resiny head. Bright, floral, citrus hop aroma with maybe a touch of buttery esters underneath. Amber-gold color. Starts off very bitter with an underlying sweetness (that buttery caramel), builds into a pine-sap hoppiness with prominent notes of grapefruit. Finish is hop bitter and sticky pine sap flavor, and then the malt comes through in a biscuit like quality under this, and the resin begins to take on an almost soapy flavor as it fades from my palate.  Not bad, overall. I'm not a big fan of that buttery caramel aspect, which I presume is here to lend a more authentic English characteristic to it. The smell started off FANTASTIC, but as the head faded, and the buttery caramel became more pronounced, I began to really hate the smell. Maybe I'm overly sensitive to diacetyl (that buttery caramel)....I do tend to have a visceral, negative reaction to it. If this were on tap, I'd blame a dirty line... Looking at the lower reviews, that seems to be a re-occuring issue for a few of us. I tend to favor the aromatic IPA's over these aggressively bitter ones (they're a fun novelty, but they get tiring). I found the ""drink by date"" and I still have a month before that date, so I know this isn't ancient and stale.  I am pairing it with Prairie Breeze cheese, and that's working quite well.

Mouthfeel is that its a moderately heavy beer. For 7 percent the alcohol hides very well. The aftertaste lingers for a while but its pleasant.  Overall, this is a very good beer.

Small, 1/4 inch head quickly dissipated leaving nice, foamy CO2 swirls.  -Smell 4.5: Wow! Amazing bouquet. Deep, deep hoppiness with a huge grapefruit hit that is quickly balanced with a subtle sweet and grassiness. I also pick up notes of caramel barley.  -Taste 4.5: Front is slightly sweet, but that's about it. Middle is grassy and smooth. Finish is where the hops hit you: huge hop punch with predominately grapefruit but also alkaline, white pepper and subtle ginger. Also a swirling, sweet, brown sugar sweetness. Finish is long and alkaline with more of the grassiness, but fades quickly into a pleasing dryness.  -Mouthfeel 4.0: Smooth and creamy carbonation that certainly enhances the enjoyment of all the hop flavors associated with this beer.  -Overall 4.5: This beer is beyond a mere American IPA. It is something else, it is its own creature that defies classification. If you are a fan of IPAs, this one will stun you.

345,1005,ThisWangsChung,3.5,"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass.  A: Pours a cloudy copper color with low clarity. The head is a one finger light khaki shade with some fantastic lacing. It also retains itself rather nicely.  S: More piny than citrusy. The hops have a strong black pepper vibe to them, while the maltiness seems almost toasted.  T: Just like the aroma, its a pine-based IPA - which isn't necessarily my preferred type of IPA. The label calls this 'spicy' and I'm inclined to agree. All of the bitterness in this brew seems to be located midpalate, as the maltiness is semi-strong to start, while the finish sees general bitterness subside in favor of a peppery hop flavor. Even if it's not horribly interesting, I'd say it's a good example of a 'balanced' IPA.  M: I think it's about 5-10% overcarbonated in general. Still, it balances nicely between wet and dry on the finish, leaning towards dry somewhat. I won't call it 'refreshing', but I will call it easy to down.  O: For better or worse, it's a bog standard IPA. Basically, if you've had SN Torpedo or FW Union Jack, you'll know what to expect here.

Standard IPA smell, not very strong, but still enjoyable.  T - Nice hop front, very piney in taste with floral undertone. Mild citrus notes become apparent when it begins to warm. Not the greatest taste in the world, but still very enjoyable and very drinkable. Mild bitter aftertaste.  M - Active carbonation that fizzes and adds a pleasant touch to the mouthfeel.

Very nice lacing that stays and stays. The smell is subtle and citrus-y. Despite it's relatively mild aroma, this beer hits the taste buds hard. Man! Bitter and sour--very much like a yellow grapefruit (definitely hop-forward. The taste is complex and deep, but the hops win out big time)--but in a really good way. A great mouthfeel--It completely coats the mouth and the taste lingers for a long time. This beer is hearty, full bodied, creamy and delicious. I have a hard time with IPAs, but this one is amazing!

T: Not the hop punch I was expecting from this beer. I get some pine, toasty malts, and that dark fruit I detected in the nose. That seems out of place for an IPA. Maybe this is the tobacco flavor people mention in some beers. I guess I've never eaten tobacco, so I wouldn't know exactly. Not a quality I find especially pleasing, most especially in an IPA. Pretty light bitterness. Somewhat earthy in the aftertaste.  M: Smooth and very tingly with the carbonation. Oily slickness.  O: I thought for sure this would satisfy my hop craving, but it just didn't do the job. A little underwhelmed with my first offering from Victory. The odd dark fruit flavor really threw me off here.

T: Incredibly powerful hop flavor. I've had a lot of pale ales and IPAs but this is likely the biggest hop punch I've tasted. The malt is present in the background but stays in the background - hops are a little bitter and do leave a very strong aftertaste. This is definitely a hop-lover's choice.  M: Good level of carbonation and thickness, not particularly memorable one way or the other (which could be a good thing).  O: I really admire the beer's boldness. Huge, huge hop kick.

For a beer that is so large on hop flavor, the malts provide a very interesting compliment as well. Citrus is apparent, (as it is with many IPA's) but there are hints of darker fruits (plum, raisen?) as well that give hopdevil a very unique nose.  M-The mouth compliments the beer very well. It is thick enough to soften some of the harsher flavors, but still soft enough to get the most out of the delicate hop tones.  T-A fantastic beer for hopheads and beer lovers alike. The hops are absolutely huge, but surprisingly not very bitter for the amount they are featured. The malts do a good deal of balancing the beer out and highlighting all this beer has to offer.

A little caramel in the background.  T: Sweet up front followed slowly by an increasing spicy bitterness leading into citrus country. A strong, rich malt presence throughout, some faint dark fruit and bready notes keep the hops (which are quite potent) from bring overpowering. Exceptionally hoppy, but well balanced. Finishes with a long, lingering bitterness in the back of my throat.  M: Medium-full bodied beer. Has a very rich feel, aided by the malt flavor and lower-than-average carbonation.  O: One of my standby IPAs. I tend to lean towards very hop-centric IPAs with just enough interesting malt flavors to back them up, but this is definitely more on the balanced side. The malt is definitely a big player here, though it's not got an overpowering caramel sweetness that I find in a lot of malt-centric IPAs (supposedly they use Munich rather than crystal malts, which might account for this).",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Soft watery mouthfeel because of the lower carbonation. Fairly dry on the finish with no distracting sidenotes. A tasty drinkable IPA. Not as devilish as the name implies.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,croixian1,4.53,"This beer will make your whole mouth dance! I forgot it in the freezer and when I remembered it was pretty much as cold as you can get before freezing. Poured into an iced tumbler. Color a deep, silky amber. Not much head because it was so cold (my fault). Aroma of hops and freshly baked, yeasty bread and light distant pineapple note. Up-front taste: Deep lushness of bitter hops and pine. Very robust yet silky mouthfeel. Swallows very smoothly. After taste: Pine, hops, slight citrus and call me crazy, but some very light notes of coffee and bitter chocolate. Long aftertaste: Hops and pine in the back of the mouth. Delicious! This beer is now in my top ten of all time. Simply a pleasure to sip and enjoy on a hot afternoon!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,hardy008,4.03,"Clear dark amber with a 3 finger off white head with very good retention and lacing. The aroma has oranges, grapefruit, pineapple, and caramel malt.  The taste has oranges, grapefruit, pineapple, grapefruit zest, caramel malt, and a little melon. The flavor is sweet with some hop bitterness for balance.  Medium bodied with average carbonation. Very smooth and easy to drink.

345,1005,Gregg03,4.75,"This is my go-to staple IPA. It is nicely balanced, great mouth-feel, soft flavors. It's called ""hop devil"" but I really think it is so well-balanced that the name is a bit mis-placed. Sometimes IPAs have a hoppy bite, but this is much more balanced than many others. The Bros are right with the ""World Class"" rating. Great beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

IN- Golden copper with a 2-finger head and light-medium lacing.  S - Mild apricot, honey, biscuit  T - Tastes much like the smell but stronger plus a nice dollop of citrus. Englsh malt. Somewhat-sweet like a Troeg's Nugget Nectar but not quite as bitter.  M - Medium body and light-medium carbonation. Smooth.  O - Very nicely served on cask. The cellerman and bartender know what they are doing. Carbonation was good and the mid-50's temperature was just right. I really enjoyed it; almost as much as on-tap.  2015 Note. Tasted great from the bottle. Reminds me of a Sierra Nevada Northern Harvest. This has less caramel nut still has a solid malt presence to compensate for the IBUs.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,lacqueredmouse,3.7,"Bottle purchased from Slowbeer in Melbourne.  Pours a pleasantly hazed deep amber, with flashes of red to it. Head is full, frothy and reasonably persistent, maintaining the majestic crest synonymous with a good IPA. Lacing is sketchy and sticky. Looks good.  Nose is a pleasant mildly fragrant, slightly fruity hop bonanza, giving a fresh (if generic) American hop aroma. Looking underneath, there's a slight meaty savouriness to the malt and even a weird salty or smoky hint. This is a very, very subtle character, however, but it's what sets it apart—mostly this falls squarely in ""generic IPA"" territory.  Taste is light, nutty and clear, with a mild bitterness through to the back, and a fragrant if slightly muted and stilted hop character. Finish has hints of pine and lavender, giving a clear bite to the aftertaste. Feel is smooth and supple. The taste is, however, quite generic, and it feels slightly flat, as if it has been cut through and dynamically shortened.  A decent brew, but not one of the best IPAs I've had. It just feels a little flatter and more generic. Despite the intrigue promised on the nose, this really ended up being ""just another IPA"".",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Kromes,4.3,"Pours a slightly hazy amber color with a thick off white head that laces the glass as it goes down. Ends up being a thin soapy line of bubbles.  Sweet toasted malt with a nice citrus grapefruit and pine hop aroma.  The flavor starts with a sweet toasted malt and floral hop flavor that blends with citrusy grapefruit hop. None of the flavors are overpowering, they all blend very well with one another. The finish is where the pine hop shows up and leaves a bitter aftertaste with a lingering toasted malt and alcohol flavor. Feel is light to medium with carbonation that fills out the beer and makes it smooth. One of the best IPAs out there.

S: Dank resin-like aromas, biscuit, honey, grapefruit,  T: Herbal, citrus, pine, biscuit, toasty, alcoholic. Sits fairly heavy on the palate with moderate carbonation, adding a velvety feel to the mix. A well-balanced finish in terms of malt and hops with a long-lasting aftertaste.  A good beer overall. A bit hard to pick out the characteristics but regardless an enjoyable beer to drink. A good job on the balance of malt and hops while still displaying qualities characteristic of an IPA, that is, hop-forwardness. I would say it lives up to its name with the overstated hop character.

It is a deep amber copper color with good clarity and signs of carbonation coming up through the glass. Nice lacing on the glass as the beer was drank.  Smell: citrus and piney hops, bready and caramel malts. All of which are typical and common of IPA's.  Taste: Veyr hop forward and enough malts in there to balance out the flavor for the most part. Some lingering bitterness, but not too annoying.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, full bodied, medium carbonation, some bitterness, and easy to enjoy.  Overall: I have had this plenty of times over the years on draft and in a bottle. Thought I reviewed it, but it was the Hop Wallop.

345,1005,Nfl1991,4.5,"This is probably one of the best IPA's I've had, and a beer that I'll return to from time to time. You can't go wrong with Hopdevil. Very hop-heavy, with a a bitter, but well balanced aftertaste. Very piney/grassy, with a medium bodied feel. Tonight I've had 4 IPA's, Titan IPA (Great Divide) , Union Jack IPA (Firestone), Stone IPA (Stone), and Hopdevil. Out of the four, I'd go back to this one first. If you've ever tried the Union Jack or the Stone, this is a similar beer in regards to it's high hop presence and grassy/piney/floral taste.

The taste shines on this one. Refreshing, wet, and bitter. Nice malts to sooth that ohhh so good bitterness. Some peach, mango, and pineapple try to come through. A very strong hop bitter aftertaste. This is a rather moist Ipa. A very good offering from Victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Grapefruit and other citrus notes, as well as floral and pine resiny aromas round out with a slight caramel malt hints. Hops dominate on the pallet as well, with citrus flavors clearly standing out before a caramel and toffee malt backbone balance it all out.

NOSE: Pineapple, grapefruit, apple juice. Smells like Smoothie King. What’s expected but missing is that woody, piney nose. Bit of a letdown.  MOUTH: Unsweetened grapefruit and lemon dash.

Very little sweetness, but lots of body and rich, bready malt character that blends perfectly with the hops. I only wish I could brew an IPA this good.  As a side note, the carbonation level right out of the bottle is just perfect. I expected to have to pour gently, since most brews are a bit overcarbed in my taste, but this one came out creamy and gentle, with a very gentle carbonic bite. Bonus points!  This is a great IPA that deserves to be on your 'every day' beer list (along side Prima Pils, of course).  edit: just figured out what this brew reminds me of - Sierra Nevada Celebration.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Clear with a good amount of bubbles.  S - Well-balanced between orange, grapefruit, and pine hops and bready, caramel malt.  T - Starts sweet with caramel malt and orange flavors and eventually builds into a bitterness with grapefruit, pine, and earthy hop notes. Well-balanced with a bitterness that slowly but steadily builds.  F - Medium-bodied with good carbonation, a sticky mouthfeel, and a nice bitter and dry finish. Earthy bitterness lingers for a nice amount of time. Maybe a slight warmth from the alcohol, but if it is there, it’s very pleasant and subtle.  O - This is a great IPA. It is very-well balanced between the malt and the hops and very drinkable. Bitterness slowly builds but is never overpowering. The alcohol is nowhere to be found. If you see it anywhere, it’s only in a the finish as a little bit of warmth, but I may be imagining that. At nearly 7% ABV, that’s pretty impressive. Really nice beer.

The hop profile is total east coast. There is some pine and some lemon, mango, ect. But this beers hops are very earthy, spicy and astringent, resinous and oily. Awesome stuff. The malt backbone is well in check, it's quite sugary and somewhat metallic tasting.  M- Bitter and a dry finish. The beer has a nice slick texture and a smooth feel. Very drinkable and tasty at the same time.  O- This is a superb IPA and the perfect example of an east coast hoppy beer.

The taste is pretty good, this one isn't as fresh as some of the ones I've had before but its still great, the hops have died down a little but they're still present, a nice peppery finish along with some sweet caramel backbone.

I get grapefruit and lemon, but not much pine.  The beer has a firm body and a slightly oily mouthfeel. The flavor is well-balanced. It's not overly sweet and it's not a tongue-bruiser. On the front of the palate, there is a nice, crisp herbal quality complementing the malt. At mid-palate, the hops take on strong grapefruit characters. The finish is nice and dry, but doesn't linger too long. There is no detectable alcohol presence.  I think this beer would appeal to fans of Czech pilsners.

It's hoppy, and it's also malty. The balance is nice. Unfortunately for me, I'm not in love with either the hop profile or the malt profile.

T- Bitter hop punch melds together with sweet caramel covered citrus. Pineapple and over ripe peaches dominate more than the normal grapefruit, orange and lemon. The bright citrus is there, but it lets other flavors lead them to you instead of kicking you in the face with bitterness.  M- Really nice carbonation that fades away with the sweetness.

It’s also very nice on draft, with a slightly smoother, stickier feel and somewhat lower carbonation on a medium body. It’s nearly clear, copper with a slight reddish tint, and has a good-sized fluffy head as well as nice retention and lacing.  Aroma and taste are very much in line; bitter citrus and pine resin hops; faintly floral notes, caramel malt that’s a bit sweeter in the taste than in the nose but doesn’t overshadow the hoppiness. The flavors are really detailed and not just bitter; finishes semi-dry, with a kiss of sweetness and lingering bitterness.

Spotting of lacing.  S: Citrusy grapefruit hops up front with some mild malt in the background. As another user said, this is very enticing.  T: Not as overly hoppy as the aroma would lead you to believe. Dont get me wrong this is plentiful in the hop department, again mostly citrus with some spiced hops. Some sweet malts in the background but that barely gets through.  M: Medium-full bodied with average carbonation. With all the hops it isnt overly sticky on the palate. Goes down smooth.  Overall another delicious IPA that I would recommend to any hophead. I like the use of whole flower hops as they add a nice nectar quality.

Aroma: Enticing, hoppy aroma, albeit rather weak.  Taste: Can taste some malts, but they are far overpowered by the hops, which are very tasty and a bit spicy, but not overwhelming or overly bitter. Leaves a hoppy finish.  Mouthfeel: Thick, slightly carbonated, bitter tang. A nice mouthfeel is one of my favorite aspects of IPA's and other hoppy craft beers. This one does not have the best of all IPA's but holds its own.  Victory HopDevil is an excellent IPA that I would recommend as a must-drink for any hophead, and you'll want to drink it several times again.

Light bodied. Enough foam and carbonation in the mouth. Some spice in the hoppy aroma.  Bitterness is more in check than a lot of IPAs, but it does end on a dry and bitter lingering note. Some tartness. Surprising dark notes. A lot of grain flavor. A touch of flowers but more resiny and dark caramel.

A: The aroma was some sweet caramel and some light floral dandelion and maybe some lavender.  M: Plenty of carbonation and a medium body. It leaves a slick coating.  T: This is where the beer shines. It begins with a caramel sweetness. Then the floral hops kick in, and then some pine comes through, too. All of the flavors are bold yet transition nicely from one to the next. It leaves a pleasently bitter after taste.  O: This is a great blend of bold flavors. Really outstanding how the flavors work well together. This a great american pale ale.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,MONKandTUCK,3.7,"On tap at Buffalo Wild Wings. Perfect pairing for wings and baseball.  A - A shade or two darker than orange. Has a fat white head. Nothing stunning, but clearly well-done.  A - Honey-like malt, a little toast. Lots of floral hops. Pine and Citrus follow. This beer could be an air-freshener, still it's not the blast I recall. Could be the moment. Could be the beer. I know I've been more blown away; not just by other beers, but also other samplings of HopDevil.  T - sweet and chewy, with some very strong citrus notes present. This never becomes as spicy as a recall. There've been times when I drank this beer and a 16oz was way too harsh and gritty to finish. This beer came out smoother, though the bitterness mounted as the glass finished.  This beer definitely throws a more interesting malt backbone than average. It's not as dry, but it's also not as sweet as many other hoppy beers. Picking a camp for it is hard to do. That's why I think the Vienna malt is such a good choice for basemalt... and hops up well to the blast of Centennial and Cascade.  M - thick, but occasionally creamy. It's not one to pound. take your time.  O -I often feel the venue matters a lot. Certain places get there hands on quality product, but don't handle it well. Had this one at Buffalo Wild Wings. I recall their Centennial IPA also waned over the course of months they offered it. Maybe it's me, maybe I am right. I dunno.  Regardless, this is an IPA that deserves to be counted among the national greats. Some may prefer others, but this has a deserved placed in the the pantheon. A little more rugged and a little thicker than average, this is a treat and a challenge in one package.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,tewaris,3.36,"Poured into a Samichlaus tulip. Best by the end of this month.  Deep amber with a good head, retention and lacing. Looks are certainly of a maltier/malt forward IPA. Aroma? Not IPA. Smaller strong ale? Amber ale? Whatever but not AIPA like. Caramel malt is strong in this one and hops are not aggressive in the aroma.  Taste follows the aroma... malty sweet with bitterness in a balancing role, getting prominent only toward the end. The hop flavors are also deeper and earthier even though it is mentioned clearly on the label that American hops are used.  Good body with alive carbonation; still a little too sweet in its finish and aftertaste. Overall it's pretty good. Can't say that I will buy it again given that I can get fresh Furious all the time which is an excellent example of an IPA with a malt character.  4, 3, 3, 4, 4",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Dark copper-brown color, a decent bit of carbonation, and head retention that looks a bit like an oil slick.  Piney smell over a nice bready malt backbone. Grassy, floral hints.  Hop Devil is a solid, reliable IPA with plenty of grapefruit, floral bitterness to go around. A dry, prickly mouthfeel with a certain creaminess to it completes the package. Balanced just towards the spicy, bitter side, this could easily be any hop lover's go to beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Hopdaemon39,4.35,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint tumbler- pours a clear pretty dark copper color with a one finger head, decent retention, and some nice lacing. Nothing extravagant.  Smell- hoppy but contained. Smells like maybe like it was dry hopped. Piney aromas predominate.  Tastes excellent- good bitterness, nice malty backbone, good hop flavors. A little orange flavor at first, followed by rich smooth malt and floral hops with a nice dry finish.  Mouthfeel is very good- medium body with moderate carbonation. A little oily but I like that in an IPA. Excellent, very drinkable IPA.

345,1005,dbrauneis,4.2,"Served in a bottle at Cork City in Hoboken, NJ  A: Pours a crystal clear golden amber in color with some light visible carbonation. The beer has a half finger tall off-white to light beige head that reduces to a thick ring at the edges of the glass. Light lacing is observed.  S: The smell starts with some light caramel malt sweetness but is quickly dominated by the citrus hops, pine/resin hops, and some very light yeast spices.  T: In the taste the hops dominate, first with the grapefruit + citrus flavors and then followed by the pine/resin flavors. There is a light presence of yeast spiciness (mostly pepper) and a lasting bitterness on the tongue.  M: Medium to full bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Slightly coats the inside of your mouth.  O: As good as I remember this beer from the early 2000s, it has really stood up through the test of time (and that was when there were not a lot of aggressively hoppy beers being produced on the East Coast). The beer has nice balance and complexity and is very enjoyable. Might be a little too intense for a session beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

A: Slightly hazy; an interesting, but darker-than-normal amber/brown, with dense, off-white foam that leaves a consistent sheet of white lacing; subtle effervescence.  S: Spicy, citrus & pine.  T: Primarily pine, followed by grapefruit, mango and spice; slight floral; toasty caramel malt; some sweetness; modest bitterness.

345,1005,orangesol,3.92,"Served on cask at The Brewhouse Grille.  A - Pours clear copper orange with a thin film of white head leaving very little lace down the glass.  S - Smells of plenty of caramel sweetness, some light hop bitterness and some dulled citric fruit. Cask may not be the best serving method for this one, seems to kill some of the usually bright nose.  T - Starts off with a bit of hop bitterness quickly giving way to plenty of sweet caramel malt and a bit of dulled citric fruit. Finish is pretty sweet with a bit of bitterness, not lingering for very long. This one may be a bit old but the cask serving really didn't help much either.  M - Smooth body with a light hoppy feel and moderately low carbonation. It looked dead when it was poured and didn't get much better.  O - I have always enjoyed Hop Devil and while this wasn't the best I have had, this one was no different.

345,1005,zac16125,4.35,"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass No born on date or other distinguishing numbers  A: Pours a translucent amber with a light mahogany hue, and 1.5 fingers width of light khaki colored head.  Leaves a small amount of random patchy lacing.    S: Caramel malts and spicy hops.   Some piney hop aromas as well and subtle citrusy notes, but surprisingly more malt sweetness than hop presence.    T: More hop character in the taste than the nose.  Some citrusy characters of orange lemon zest, peach and grapefruit, along with a prominent hop spice.  A firm malt backbone brings a sweetness that balances things out nicely. A piney hop bitterness comes out on the back end as it warms.  I wouldn't call it a hop bomb, even though there is a significant hop presence, because there is a big malt presence as well.  Very well balanced and tasty.    M/D: Pretty smooth for the style.  Moderate carbonation and a medium body.  Good drinkability, certainly a sessionable IPA.  Very nice mouthfeel.    O: Overall, a very good IPA bordering on great, that I find myself going to fairly often.  Good flavor profile and drinkability, and it's ready available and reasonably priced.  Certainly worthy of a try.  I will add that I prefer it out of the bottle over on tap, as the hop characters are more prevalent from the bottle.

Big, bold flavor with very little bitterness, pretty spicy, but not as hoppy as I was hoping for, The 6.7% ABV is hidden well, but it just tasted to me like a ""dark"" beer, not so much your standard IPA.

Again quite yeasty. Golden syrup.  Taste is smooth but nondescript malt. Bit of leafiness and bitterness.  Mouthfeel is medium with medium carb. Not bad.  I don't know how this has less flavour than their Oktoberfest (consumed prior).

Hop smell isn't too overbearing, 'tho it's pineapple and grapefruit kind of clashes with the warm malt and goes metallic. The taste is another story: the malt compliments the overdose of hops beautifully, bouncing back and forth between the bitter hop and the sweet malt. A little alcohol sneaking through is the only chink in the armor.  Not my favorite IPA, but right up there with the rest of 'em. Top notch brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,tony223366,4,"A: Gorgeous ruby amber color. Crystal clear clarity. Some nice action from the carbonation. Head is fluffy and 2 fingers and very sticky. This is a really good looking beer.  S: Tons of citrus up front with a really nice zestiness. Some pine as well. It smells really crisp and refreshing. There is some malt sweetness in there too. Primarily showing up as some caramel of course.  T: Wow! This beer is like a slap in the face. In a good way. With hops. First is the hop showcase coming off primarily with citrus. It's clean and bright and a beauty. After that I get just a bit of alcoholic spiciness. It finishes malty in a caramelly way. Maybe just slightly bready. The finish is bitter all the way, just itching you to take another sip.  M: Really, really crisp carbonation which is a necessity with a beer like this. Really helps to get you through each swallow. Past that it's smooth with a medium body.  O: Excellent IPA!

345,1005,Parrotshake,3.93,"What a treat it is to have Victory's beers available on our shores. I've had everything from their range that we get out here multiple times, and it's pretty much uniformly terrific. Summer, while officially over, shows no sign of relinquishing it's sticky grip on this part of the country, and if I had my druthers I'd have a fridge full of Prima Pils and maybe a couple of Helios saisons with which to ride it out. This beer, also, is really fucking good.  Pours a red-tinted orange with a wispy tan head. Still and maybe a bit flat, but gosh it's a pretty colour. Pretty standard nose of pine needles and caramel.  Big malt presence, more than even the nose lets on. Bread dough, caramel, maybe a bit of honey. At the same time the hops are going to work too. Pine, citrus pith, some earthy/herbal flavors. Not super-complex, but strikes a really good balance. Incrediblly full and silky mouthfeel. After each sip your palate feels properly coated with goodness.  Textbook US IPA. I like it an awful lot.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Smell is rich with citrus and piney hops balanced somewhat with malt. Taste is very much as expected, hop heavy, piney but not bitter, with a minor note of malt behind it. Not much else there, a bit of citrus, maybe a hint of vanilla? Fairly full-bodied with a surprisingly restrained effervescence for the style. Drying finish. A much nicer IPA, much more balanced than so many others, not all hops with nothing else, well worth drinking.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Pours a clear copper color with an ivory, solid one finger head that lingers and leaves light lacing.  A caramel, bready malt backbone supports hop aromas of grapefruit, lemon, and resin. There's a toasted note at the finish. Pine comes out as it warms.  Flavor is bready malt initially, with a nutty, toasted character in the slightly bitter finish. Grapefruit, pineapple, and bitter resin are interwoven in the profile.  Body is moderate with a moderate to high level of carbonation.  Overall, a more malt forward ipa than the moniker might suggest.

345,1005,mjtiernan,3.87,"12oz bottle poured into a NB globe. Enjoy by April 30 2012...pretty fresh.  A: Pour down the middle produced a half-finger head which didn’t last very long. Left a small cap in the center that eventually spread over the whole glass and a sizable ring around the edge. Body is a slightly brownish-red with a some haziness. Lacing is spotty throughout.  S: A mix of mostly pine and some citrus and a solid slightly-sweet malt backbone. There’s also a candy-like characteristic reminiscent of Smarties.  T: The taste mirrors the nose but adds a good amount of woody pine complexity. There is also some crusty bread and a dose of caramel malt.  M: Medium to heavy body. Mouthfeel is somewhat creamy and soft. Carbonation is obviously there, but pretty low for an IPA.  O: The hops are nice but this doesn’t have a whole lot of complexity. Being more of a fan of citrusy IPAs than pine-centric IPAs, I didn’t go ga-ga over this. However I can appreciate that it is a finely crafted beer and would happily grab a sixer of it in a pinch.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,BarryMFBurton,4.21,"Loved Victory’s Prima Pils, so this one is a must-try. It’s been a little tough to find “in season,” but I’m glad to have a current bottle.  “Enjoy By: May 30 2012” on the label. Good enough for me.  A: A full, shimmering amber-orange color – orange Jolly Rancher shine, though a little darker. Off-white, micro-bubbled head, a silky finger-and-a-half. The lacing wraps all the way around the glass, beautiful all the way to a light retention. Type “amber beer” in to Google and you’ll find a picture that looks quite a bit like this. Near-perfect.  S: Hops aren’t too strong here – a mild mix of floweriness and bright citrus before the generous grain bill. These malts are moderately thick, showing aromas of toast, pale malts, ginger, and peach. Rounded out with an earthy resin scent; mild, again, but nice.  T: Malty goodness overflowing from first sip to last, doughy, toasty, spiced bread (like rye), and mildly tropical fruit flavors. It’s deliciously sweet, earthen, and bready, with a hint of farm-freshness to give this one a good dose of that genuine IPA taste – you know, the other flavor besides bitterness that defines an India Pale Ale. And then here come the hops: orange peel, grapefruit, lemonade, floweriness, and a hint of pine sap. The kick is not overwhelming, but not stingingly bitter; what balance! Aftertaste, then, is dry and sweet, with lightly astringent alcohol. This is an IPA undoubtedly built for me – delicious!  M: Light, like most Victory beers, though with a solid oily touch. Thick enough to notice the crisp bubbles at the start of each sip, as well as the slow astringency of the aftertaste.  O: Sipping this brings me back to Sierra Nevada’s Celebration, but without the intense hoppiness. There’s a certain balance to this beer that brings these flavors to a place I wish every IPA could go to: smooth, complex, and with a drinkable hop presence. Victory has seriously bottled excellence here.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,CPDalton,4.2,"Appearance: Pours a golden brown with a finger of sticky head. Looks gorgeous. Laces nicely all the way down.  Smell: Some sweetness at the front, with some definite floral notes following. Nothing complex or over powering, smells like an IPA.  Taste: I get an immediate kick of the hops, which works well with the carbonation. It finishes a bit sweet, almost honey like. There's some grapefruit-like taste in there as well.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth and crisp, leaves a good taste in the mouth. Leaves you wanting more.  Overall: A very interesting IPA indeed. It doesn't finish with a strong bite like you would expect, rather it hits you right up front and fades into a bubbly sweetness. I got this in a make your own 6 pack, and I'm glad I did. Not sure if I'd go for a 6 pack of this by itself though.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,littlelorib,4.42,"Golden with a thin creamy head that fades fairly quickly but leaves a persistent lacing. Aroma is a bit of malt followed by piney spicy hops. Hops are definitely on the forefront in the taste, too, with grapefruit and a nice mix of spices. There may actually be a hint of malt in there too.  Overall, a better than average, drinkable IPA. I am not finding the bitterness overwhelming, and there is a nice variety of hops elements in the smell and taste to keep me coming back.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

S - Not very powerful. Little bit of caramel, little bit of citrus.  T - Very hoppy at first but calms down and finishes very smooth. Slight caramel taste. Not as bitter as you'd expect, flavor is more subtle than aggressive.  M - Pretty great. Almost no noticeable carbonation and feels very full even though the taste doesn't entirely back it up.  O - Pretty good, not my favorite from Victory. I do prefer its calmer flavor to a more aggressive IPA.

Flavor is very malt forward, caramel, toffee, some sweetness. Hops are not particularly present in the flavor, with little citrus or pine influence. Medium carbonation and heavier on the palate than I expected. Overall I was not impressed with this one and suspect I got an old bottle. Will revisit.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Darkmagus82,4.09,"Hand pulled and served in 10 oz chalice  Appearance – A deep golden color with a light slight off white head. The head fades with a bit of lacing on the sides of the glass and giving a thin foam film that persisted throughout the drinking experience.  Smell – Piney hops are the most prevalent, but are mixed with some more citrus and a bit of floral hop as well. A very small amount of caramel can be detected as well, but is largely overshadowed by the nice hoppy aroma.  Taste – Smooth malt of breadiness and sweeter caramel are up front, but soon become just a base for a nice potent hop flavor. Pine is up first and is the strongest of the hop flavor. A bit of citrus then comes into the profile and mixes nicely with the pine. These two flavors with the caramel malt backbone take the taste to the finish with a long lasting spicy hop flavor that lasts in the mouth for quite some time.  Mouthfeel – As with most cask beers, this one is a bit low on the carbonation level, but yet soother and creamier tasting then its bottled contour part. It’s a different feel for the beer. I am not sure if I like it more this way or the more normal bottle/tap way. The cask’s smoothness kind of soothes the hoppy burn a bit, complimenting it nicely. But with the soothing comes some extinguishing of a nice hop flavor. It’s a tough call…  Overall – A good brew to try on cask if you have a chance. Different flavor and feel profiles are definitely accentuated this way.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,blackcompg,3.93,"Poured from their 12oz bottle...  Appearance - Poured nearly 3 fingers of beautiful bumpy golden cumulus, the color of the ale is a brite copper amber color, with yellow orange hilites when held to the lite.  Smell - Wow, lemon and pine, with a touch of crisp biscuit in the background. Nice, but on the lite side in the nose. This ends up being the only week part of this ale.  Taste - With a name like hopdevil I almost winced in anticipation of having my tastebuds destroyed, but was I wrong. Starts with really flavorful lite grassy green hops and lemon citrus, citrus becomes more pronounced and introduces grapefruit with a touch of citrus sweetness, there is also crispy biscuits and a touch of malt here too, the finish is grapefruit and pine, but not overpowering here at all - smooth transitions, nice balance, and decent complexity. Finish is bitter but still juicy.  Mouthfeel - Lite to medium, but actually very juicy, making the mouth water. Carb is medium but very smooth, adding a brite crispness, but the edges are smoothed by the juiciness of this beer. Really a fantastic mouthfeel on this, highly drinkable and downright thirst quenching.  Overall - What a nice IPA! I'm really enjoying this alot. Not overly bitter, and definitely not overly sweet, such a perfect balance. A great looker with nice lacing and a fantastic mouthfeel, alcohol is very well hidden too, and sessionable at 6.7% A must try.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,kemoarps,4.15,"Pours an amber the colour of dehydrated urine. That came out wrong. I don't mean it as a bad thing, but that's the colour it is (I just had to teach a BSA First Aid class and we were talking about signs of dehydration, so that's why it's on my mind). Minimal head, but good lacing. Not unattractive looking, but doesn't really stand out in my book.  The first whiff I catch is floral hops with a decent caramel malt balance. Again, nothing really stands out, but what little comes through isn't unpleasant.  After the pour and the nose, my hopes were not super high for this, but it really comes through on the tongue and is very well crafted beer. With a name like hopdevil I was expecting it to just be a bitter bomb. It isn't (I see this as a good thing). It certainly is guided by its citrusy hops, but they are incredibly smoothe and mellow, like a good wine. A touch of biscuit malts serves to balance it a little bit.  Appropriate level of carbonation for what it is, and ultimately a quite drinkable beer. I was not overly excited about this going in (I'm not a huge hop head), but was thoroughly impressed. I felt like it was exceptionally crafted, with good balance. Nice and smoothe, with a mellow complexity to it, it brings to mind fine wine (not in flavours, but in character). Absolutely give it a try if you see it. Well worth checking out.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,NiceTaps,3.88,"Poured into a pint glass from a bottle.  A-Orange/amber color, clear and clean. A decent head with a little lacing.  S-The cleanest smelling American IPA, perhaps. I don't pick up any strong citrus or pine scents.  T-There are citrus flavors and a little malt backround. Also a little pine to round out the flavor. Bitter, but tasty.

345,1005,muskiesman,4.08,Pint glass from on tap at Tuscany Brewhouse  A very satisfying brew. Admittedly I did not pick up much in the nose here but a wallop of fresh flavors when tasted.

345,1005,JWU,4.38,"12oz. bottle poured into my trusty mug.  A- Beautiful deep translucent copper/amber. Off white head that dissipates in a normal amount of time, but leaves great lacing.  S- sweet caramel and grainy malt base, with a nice balancing citric/earthy hop.  T- Starts with an interplay between the grainy malts and the citric and earthy hops, smooths out into a nice caramel note, and comes back to a light grapefruit bitter hop note which leads to the dry, but not overly dry finish. This is one of the few IPA's which has earthy and citic hop profiles in perfect harmony.  M- lighter side of medium, perfect carbonation, and dries perfectly on the back end. Only thing I could possibly ask for is possibly a bit more of a creamy mouthfeel.  O- Stands out in an overcrowded field of IPA's. Not your average IPA with the big German malt bill, but the hop profile on this is what brings me back time and again. Fantastic stuff.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Smell: Very good aroma. Tons of citrus and fruit aroma with a little pine. Very inviting.  Taste: The taste is very good but I have had better. The bitterness of the hops is well balanced with the sweetness of the grains.  Mouthfeel: The carbonation is good but maybe a little light. Nice finish.  Overall: The beer has a great appearance and although the taste is very good, I found myself a little let down just because of how good it looked. Definitely worth trying again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Fatehunter,4.06,"Poured into a glass stein. Transparent copper color with an off-white half finger of head.  A wonderfully complex smell. Rich malt grain throughout, grapefruit and lemon zest in the middle, ending with a sharp citrus smell at the end.  A really solid malt profile. It's always there but doesn't overpower. The hops really shine: grapefruit most obvious, other citrus too. A great bitterness to finish it out.  Soft, but full texture, low carbonation and a little sticky.  Excellent beer and fun to drink.

S - Wonderful scents of tangerine & peach sit atop caramel sweetness, lemon zest, grains, grass, and yeasty funk.  T - Waves of mango, orange rind, and a combonation of bitter and juicy hops start the sip, followed by a good dose of caramel malts, leading to a slightly dry, malty finish.  M - The medium body holds moderate carbonation, with a slight dryness on the finish.

Smell: Large amount of hop character and a buscuit/bread smell as well.  Taste: I can see why it's called ""HopDevil."" A generous flavoring of piney hops from start to finish, light hints of malt and citrus with a moderate bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Light to moderate body with a refreshing, moderate amount of carbonation. Very refreshing and delicious.

Great oily hop aroma and a biscuity malt backbone. East coast all the way.  Slapfaced spicy pine hop attack on the palate with a grapefruit twist. A little tinny with the malt, some backend chemical alkaline, but it pairs with some juicy melon. Decent malt backbone with a whole-grain bread feel. Some unexpected alcohol burn.

T - The beer starts with a slight toasty biscuit flavor noticeable on the nose but is immediately joined by the nice hop character. Pine and Citrus and Earthy hop tones.

345,1005,ummswimmin,4.2,"Victory's Hopdevil is very easy to find around here. It is funny how very well made beers like Arrogant Bastard, Allagash White, and Dale's Pale Ale being so prevalent make it easier to pass on getting a pint. I can always get any of these beers, so I go for the special release product.  I can tell you that the orange/coppery color and fluffy foam look pretty good. Or, I can tell you about the abundence of hoppiness in the nose. I could describe the balance and thoroughly enjoyable flavor in this IPA. The flavor is strong enough that you have to confirm the ABV to know that it isn't a double IPA. If you live in Pennsylvania or New Jersey (and probably quite a few other states in the area), then you know this is a very good beer.  Pick up a bottle or a pour.

Mostly clear, a bit of cloudiness. Beautiful color.  S: Very fruity and citrusy. Smells of pineapple, maybe apple and/or grapefruit, notes of pine, maybe some orange peel. Light on the hop aroma. The nose is not too light or too pungent on this one, pretty much just right on the aromatic strength scale.  T: Better than your average IPA in my opinion, though I'm admittedly not much of an IPA guy. Starts citrusy, notes of fruit in the mid palate, consistent with the aroma - maybe pineapple, apple, pear, banana, grapefruit, orange peel, it's hard to tell, but definitely a tropical fruity flavor. A decent hit of classic IPA pine comes through between the mid palate and the finish. Finishes dry with some nice bitter hops. Almost reminds me of a tamed Double Bastard.  M: Higher carbonation, medium bodied, slightly chewy, some watery feel but not much.  O: This is a very drinkable IPA, even for those who aren't much into IPAs. I expected it to be a little more hoppy given it's name. Doesn't overload you with a bombardment of pine, which was a nice change for a craft IPA, and the tropical fruits are a nice touch.  Solid IPA, probably not the best of the best, but definitely a breath of fresh air for those like me who gravitate more toward dark stouts and porters.

T: The taste is dominated by a sweet bready and toffee malt with some minimal piney notes as well light citrus mingling in there. There is a touch of some floral nights that do brighten it up a bit, but still not enough.  M: The mouthfeel is solid, a tad on the lighter side. The body has tons of lively carbonation to it.

Look: Poured a dark murky orange color. 1-finger of spongy off white head. Carbonation level was strong.  Smell: A pungent bouquet of floral hops and sweet malts. Also some pine and vanilla - A Very East Coast aroma. Could remind you of Stoudt's Double IPA.  Taste: The beer had a juicy mouth feel. First were bitter floral notes that quickly became sweet like a sugared peach or pear. The finish was surprisingly clean with a nice bitterness that offered a pleasant fruity aftertaste.  This is a great IPA that is well balanced and very drinkable. The juicy fruit notes were what made this an excellent beer to me.

This is darker than Hop Wallop, a reddish copper with a white head. Flavor is super tight, pretty dry, caramel malt with a faint sweetness, a hops are prevalent and throughout the palate a la a fresh harvest ale. I began to appreciate the dryness of this, and the tight balance next to Ranch, which was a hot mess in comparison.

If you are a hop head this is definitely a beer for you. HopDevil has a wonder hoppy flavor and it is not too over powering in the alcohol department in other words you can drink a 6 pack after work and still drive home for dinner. When a hopDevil is poured into a glass you imediately notice its pleasant smell and its color. The taste is burst of flavors the kick the you know what out of your mouth and tongue.

345,1005,jegross2,3.8,"Reviewing the Hop Devil Ale from Victory Brewing Company. Score: 87  2011 vintage bottle with March 18 2012 freshness date served in a Sam Adams perfect pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a transparent deep red/orange copper color with a finger of soapy cream colored head that settles into a thin lace across the surface of the beer. Excellent lacing. 4/5  Smell: Lots of funky citrus, grapefruit, and earthy hops dominate the nose, though the aroma is not pungent. 4/5  Taste: Lots of zesty grapefruit, spices, and citrus hops upfront. Some pine. Sharp caramel maltiness on the mid-palate. At first, the zestiness is crisp, though there is a lingering finish of earthy bitterness and dirt. As the beer layers, however, pine and zesty grapefruit gradually grow in the finish. The maltiness also grows in the finish too as the brew layers. Very smooth and refreshing, and not too hops-forward (though I am admittedly a hop head). 4/5  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with high-medium carbonation. Oily on the tongue. Dry, lingering finish that is both bitter and malty. 4/5  Overall: A zestily hopped single IPA with a strong malt backbone. A very balanced brew.  Recommendation: Given its balanced hoppiness, this is a good starter IPA for casual beer drinkers. Beer geeks should enjoy this one too.  Pairings: Falafel or beef shawarma.  Cost: $9.99 for a six pack.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Creamy off white head retains very well at a solid inch and a half. Lacing is creamy and coating, covering much of the glass surface.  S: Perfumey floral hops, citrus notes of mandarin orange and other vague tropical fruits. Dry leafy herbs in the background. A big, balancing malt presence of caramel, toasted grain, and toffee.  T: All hops up front. Bite of ruby red grapefruit, touch of pine. Mandarin orange and other pithy citrus fruits. Hops also display an earthy and herbal dimension. A hefty malt backbone tempers the bite of the hops as it picks up steam on the mid-palate. Caramel, toffee, and toasted biscuit bring the beer into balance. Finishes with a lingering grapefruit bitterness and underlying caramel.  M: Hefty medium body. Very full and creamy in the mouth with a slight sense of weight. Moderate carbonation, very smooth. Drinks like a cloud.  O: This is a beer from a bygone era, really. Not too many people are making American IPAs this way anymore. Certainly not your West Coast hop bomb; balance is the name of the game here. Having said that, there is certainly still a place for it. In the end it's just a damn good beer that drinks too easily, and that will win the day regardless of where the style is heading at present.

345,1005,kzoobrew,3.5,"Review input from notes  Deep orange colored body. Slightly hazy but nothing that detracts from the beer. Two finger eggshell colored head rests atop. The head recedes rather quickly leaving a modest amount of lacing.  The first thing I notice in Hop Devil is a biscuity malt presence. While it is not the predominant aroma, it is a bit more assertive than I would expect for the style. Pine dominant hop aroma is accompanied by pleasant floral and subtle citrus scents.  Sweet bready malt rolls on to the tongue, this is soon overwhelmed by a strong piney bitterness. The hop profile comes off as a bit too one dimensional. There simple is not enough citrus or floral flavors to compliment the overwhelming pine bite.  Medium bodied, appropriate carbonation. The finish is on the drier side and is what should be expected from the style.  Hop Devil just does not do it for me. The hop flavor is not to my liking, I find it a bit abrasive. Not a bad beer, others seem to really like it however it is not one I will seek out.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,rebel1771,4.33,A: Pours a slightly hazy copper color with a thick white head that sticks around a long time.  S: Strong hop aromas of grapefruit and pine resin dominate the smell.  T: Big spicy hop blast up front. Grapefruit and pine all the way with a barely there peppery note. A bit of toasted malt in the aftertaste.  O: Overall a great brew. The hops are at a level they should be and the brewer didn't try to blast you out of the park with insane ibu's.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,leansean88,4.7,"A - A promising head that will not leave easily. Cloudy and amber.  S - Very up front, in a good way. You can certainly smell the hops, but there's something much more there.  T - Huh... that's beyond belief. Never have I had an IPA so smooth, so perfectly balanced between hops, malt and alcohol. It's a beautiful thing... it really is.  M - Fantastic. An absolutely awesome feeling.  O - BEST. IPA. EVER. Well best one that I've had, but I must say, it'll be hard to beat this one out.  Await trying it on tap some day...",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Rhynes2,4.59,Pours a nice darker color for an IPA. Only got a small head built up but great lacing down the glass. Smell is piney with a hint of malt sweetness. Great hop taste with this one. For a hop centered beer they keep everything in check. It's hop dominated but very well rounded. I like a beer that goes overboard with hops but I know a great balance as well. Great beer and for sure one to put on your list of beers to try.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,SawDog505,4.38,"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a beautiful brigjt reddish orange, with half inch of off white head, leaves some attractive lacing. Smell is tangerine, pine, grass, and some floral hops also. Taste is all of that, tangerine and floral hops are most prominent. This is a really balanced IPA, very nice flavor, not over the top. Body isn't overly dry, not thick or thing, just right. Plenty of life and very drinkable. This beer is great, must be the freshest Hopdevil I have ever had, says best before April 7th 2012.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,zander4dawin,3.68,"A darker IPA with a very thin head that turned to nothing but a few suds. Great pine and floral smell. Has some sweet roasted malt taste, even some burnt sugar, followed but spicy, floral, but not some much bitter hop notes. Easy to drink, doesn't over whelm the pallet. I actually find it quite mellow, like an extra floral pale ale.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,StonedTrippin,3.87,"famous for a reason, but really the first of its kind... a big bold merger of a red ale and an ipa. pours redish with plenty of head, smells like an ipa, but add some malty sweetness a la american red/amber ale. makes for a really nicely balanced flavor profile with the hops still dominant. bitter but not brutal finish. medium body and good carbonation make it plenty drinkable. goes great with grilled chicken, and gets a nice warm buzz on. one of the first craft beers i got into, i owe a lot to this one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,tdm168,4.03,"Pours a pale amber with a mountain of off white, dense, foamy head that has great retention. The nose has floral, piny hop aromas as well as some some bready, malty notes. The taste is bready, biscuity, doughy up front with some bitter, piny, pineapple-like, citrusy hops. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, well carbonated, and very smooth.  The flavor profile here is complex and intense. The hops reach every spectrum and the malt is complimentary and reaching in its own right. Definitely worth checking out.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,jrenihan,3.88,"Enjoy by March 8, 2012 printed on label.  Beer is amber in colour. Moderate white head. Good lacing.  Smell is quite balanced for an IPA. The focus is on the hops, with damp pine scents and a bit of juicy pineapple, but the malt is right up there with the hop scents. A bit of a bready aroma.  Taste is similar to the nose. Damp pine, mild pineapple and other citrus flavours, and a bready, biscuity malt backbone. Finish is quite bitter but not overly so.  Moderate to high carbonation. Medium body. A bit sticky.  Overall, good. In my view, not a great IPA but certainly enjoyable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

S: Sweet, clean-smelling hops. ""Fresh."" Smells like a wet, fresh cut tree. Sweet-smelling maltiness in the background.  T: Starts to bitter immediately, but peaks quickly and levels out. Hops don't overpower. Almost no alcohol taste (6.7 is not too high, but it's hidden very well all the same).  M: Fairly dry, moderately high carbonation. A smooth swallow.  O: Overall very nice. Well-balanced, sessionable even at 6.7%. For IPA's, I'll put it in my starting rotation.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,jmarklan,4.35,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  A: Pours a deep copper with a dense, long lasting head with excellent lacing.  S: Hops dominate the nose but are not overly pungent. Citrus with pine and a touch of grapefruit. Enticing aroma.  T: A parade of spicy and bitter hops bring in a wave of grapefruit and slight piney flavors followed by a noticeable caramel malt backbone.  M: Medium body, smooth with perfect carbonation. The hop resin leaves a glorious aftertaste on the palate that cries out for more and more.  O: Damn delicious. This may be my favorite offering from victory. The hops dominate for the most part but the substantial malt backbones brings a lot to the table. Highly recommended",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,iDrinknewglarus,3.9,"A: Pours a clear amber. Big-bubbled head fizzles away kind of fast, lacing is just ok.  S: Really malty sweet (honey), followed by hops. I'd actually say that this is a malt forward IPA, judging from the smell alone. I do get a slight bit of grapefruit and pine.  T: Unlike how it smells, it is actually a good bit bitter all the way through. It does have a real solid caramel and biscuit malt backbone. Finishes biting and with a squeaky clean bitterness.  M: Medium with a good amount of carbonation to last the entire glass. I really like the way this beer feels in the mouth. It's got that perfect IPA ""weight"" if you know what I mean.  While I very much enjoy drinking this fine ale, I sort of wish the aroma had more pronounced hops. Also I yearn for more hop flavor.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,jtierney89,4.3,"Big grapefruit hop aroma. Straw/amber color with a white sticky head. Wow it smells delightful, lots of floral hops as well. Slight alcohol esters as well. Lots of tropical fruit on the nose, looking forward to tasting it (I hated the artwork btw, hoping the beer outdoes its art)  Quite delicious. Honey suckle and coriander malt sweetness up front. A nice earthy presence on the middle of the palate. Finishes with a nice sour grapefruit and earthy hop bitterness. Incredible balance, not quite the devil its name makes it out to be.  Im impressed with this beer, I haven't been impressed with a lot of victory stuff but this is quite a good beer. Light to medium in body with lots of carbonation and incredible drinkability. Nice.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,TheBigBoy,3.75,"Ok - i've had HopDevil many times in bottle and in draft...and to no surprise, I do find this too be much, much better on draft. A flavorful IPA with not too much power, you can drink a few of these. Has a craft taste to it, which I say as a complement, not a criticism. I am fan of most beers from Victory in including one of my favorites, Prima Pils. if you like IPAs that are not over the edge, you probably will enjoy this one thoroughly. Get it on draft and enjoy it that much more.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,ChadQuest,2.33,"This bottle was poured into my samual adams perfect pint glass i purchased at the sycamore Hy-Vee for $2.95 that i rinsed and let air dry before serving beverages. Glass temperature was room temp which is about 60 degrees.  Pour has a solid head about 3 fingers tall and leaves lacing. The color is dark for an ipa by todays standards, and i say is a dead on match to ""alloy orange"", with the hex triplet code #C46210. google it.  Aroma lets you know this is an IPA, kinda. There are a bit more then a balanced load of hops poking out of here but not by much. A notion of Grapefruits amid evergreen saps float barely over some toasted caramel malts.  The flavors are more unimpressive, IPAs have really evolved a long way since this was a top tier offering, and really shows how uni-dimensional the use of cascade hops can be. That said this comes out as a beer that tastes exactly like you would expect in that there is grapefruit/citrus, some pine notes, layered over a caramel backbone. sounds like a blueprint for mediocrity.  The mouthfeel is slightly low in carbonation from center, resulting in a slightly sweeter finish and creamy feel. Needs to be dryer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Interesting taste, I've been drinking a lot of citrusy IPA's lately and this is a good change of pace. Earthy, floral hops up front with a big malt taste in the middle.

The head has some really nice staying power and leaves behind loads of sticky lacing. The film is thick with lots of large bubbles around the edges.  S: Hoppy, but balanced. Sharp, clean citrus and some pine. Malts are bready and caramel.  T: Again, the taste is hop forward, but remains balanced. Citrus(lemon and orange), pine and earthy(almost musty) hops are present. Bread and caramel backbone give way to a slightly bitter finish. There's also a spicy quality to the taste, but not sure what to attribute it to. Very nice tasting beer.  M: On the full side of medium bodied, creamy.  O: HopDevil is a very enjoyable beer and continues Victory's string of solid offerings.

345,1005,IPA4LIFE,4.5,"A- Beautiful rich copper color with an off-white 1 finger head with impressive retention and good lacing. Really beautiful IPA.  S- Great nose. Absolutely awesome. Personally, I think too many IPAs have aromas that are too hop-forward. I know that is kinda the idea with an American IPA, but I appreciate balance, even in a style that is defined by it's use of hops. There is an awesome rich malt complexity up front. Sweet caramel notes and some bread characteristics blend into the aromas contributed by the hops. Very earthy with a little citrus and some clean pine. Trying to pick up the hops they used, I would guess  T-Again, amazingly balanced. The hops are more prevalent in the flavor than in the aroma, but that is to be expected. Up front, there is some subtle sweetness from the malt that is quickly replaced by a strong hops flavor. It is smooth and earthy, with a good amount of bitterness, but not just bitter for the sake of being bitter. This is a really complex and interesting taste. The sweetness of the malt, the flavor and bitterness from the hops all blend together well to make a well balanced, wonderful beer. The complexity and sophistication reminds me of something like DFH 90 minute. Really good beer.  M- Smooth and well carbonated. Just the right mouthfeel for this style.  D- Maybe the only ""weak"" point. The bitterness and richness of the flavor make this not the most drinkable beer, but still not too bad.  O- Really, really good American IPA. Everything is there, and everything is balanced. This may be one of my favorite beers that I have every had. Awesome beer.

The caramel comes through nicely alongside the hops, making for a nice balance.  M - Medium bodied, smooth and surprisingly wet.  O - A very tasty American IPA and a solid example of the style.

Nice notes of grapefruit and other hop tastes that remind of wet hopped; solid and equal to the task malt presence that makes this a joy to drink. I love it.

Sweet with a little bitter hoppiness on the finish, but nothing to justify the name. Otherwise, just a dank malty caramely bready beer that I'm really not enjoying very much. There's a slightly burnt/roasted taste that I can't quite nail down.  Mouthfeel is the one plus here - it's really smooth and creamy. But overall this is not an IPA I have any desire to try again.

345,1005,BerkeleyBeerMan,4.92,"From the recently discovered journals of a beer lover.  Years ago before I was into beer tasting, I forgoed picking up a sixer of this for the more familiar and fantastic Stone IPA. Gargoyles, guardians against evil, must have protected me with their bright citric West coast flavors. Then, it vanished from the shelves. Lurking beneath the surface of a budding america beer culture the beast from the east planned its victory like Lovecraft's Cthulu. Now that its back. The hopdevil has me. I'll drink it likes its my last. Like their is a hellhound on my trail...  This beer unleashes demoniac lupulin lust while satiating my desire for morose malts. So sinful yet so delicious, its our nature to love the drink and this beer pulls that yen right out of me. Thick with a blood red undertone. Thick creamy satanic head locks in the flavors.  I smell dough. Baked fresh from the ovens of Babylon. Something smells of beer's most ancient secrets. Sinister yet delectable. A danky and oily tincture of hops stews sinisterly with roasted malts of the most english character. That seducer of women chocolate lurks in the background.  I am awed by the diverse hop flavors. They taunt me, the lupulin lover I am with their phantasmagoric sleep of floral, herbal and danky character. Truly the beast of sleep. This rough beast slouches with a doughy and biscuity English malt spine. Dark fruits howl ""plum, apricot, raisin.""  This thick elixir both pulverizes and perfects me.

Citrus and pine immediately! Some floral mixing with a bready- buscuity taste, also a sweet caramel that balances it out at the very end with a lingering slight bitterness.  Carbonation is about medium. Refreshing -- spite the bitterness, I could drink this all night.  This a very tasty, well balanced IPA. A hint of alcohol is noticeable.

345,1005,iSip,3.33,"Victory Brewing Hop Devil IPA: It’s time to discuss variety, supposedly the spice of life. Do you try a new beer or go with a tried and true beer, which you know is good. Is the reward of discovering a new great beer worth the risk of having a six pack in the fridge that turned out to be a dud? I have decent list of known great IPA’s. Why try yet another, like the Hop Devil? Well I did. The Hop Devil, once in the glass, has a brown color, very dark for an IPA, and an off-white head. The aroma is more of roasted malt than aromatic hop. The flavor has a back bone of roasted malt, but prominent throughout is a lot of hop bitters. It’s a good IPA, but not as balanced as others and missing the really aromatic flavorful hops that I prefer to have come out in an IPA. So in this case, I should have stayed with one of my tried and true standards in the IPA world. Such are the risks of beer exploration.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Looks great.  Smell is fresh and delightful. Lots of sweet caramel malt underlying, hint of bread grain, but largely just light floral hops, hint of lemon zest, rosewater and fresh pineapple and a touch of resinous bitterness as well. Bit subdued, but otherwise ideal.  Taste hits you with those hops right away. Resinous notes and a touch of fresh pine that develops malty notes as an afterthought for the mid. Touch of barley, English toffee and lemon curd, before hops take over for the finish. Slight tartaric sherbety twang gives a nice lightness, but the bitterness is separate, resinous and quite drying at the back. Still a nice blend between those different hop characters and the pleasant malt base. I likes.  Fairly full body but a slight harsh back as it goes down. It could be carbonation but I think it's more likely hop oils sharpening the finish. Not bad.  I won't lie and say I haven't had better IPAs, but I certainly haven't had a better IPA from Victory.

The aroma is caramel, molasses, citrus, and some pine. Nothing overwhelming, but nice nonetheless. The taste is pine and citrus. I can't really pinpoint what kind of citrus I am tasting, but I am not getting grapefruit. This is a pretty bitter beer, but the malt sweetness really balances it out. The mouthfeel is light to medium and the carbonation is medium. Overall, one of the best IPA's out there. My only complaints is the mouthfeel. I prefer a thicker mouthfeel.

Very nice balance, though I prefer a slightly stronger hop aroma from my IPAs.  Great balance between the hops and malts, though the hops really shine through.

There is some hop bite, but the flavors are so well crafted around the hops that its superb to me.  Mouthfeel - Full bodied and just right.

Floral hops on the nose are most prevalent, kind of like potpourri and an almost soapiness there. Faint caramel malt trying to show up.  Flavor is good with pretty good balance. Floral and mild pine hops notes with solid hop bitterness are the defining characteristics with an underlining mild caramel malt body.  Medium bodied mouthfeel due to the bitterness. Fairy fresh and crisp with med-high carbonation.  Overall it's a good, pretty highly drinkable IPA. Nothing mind blowing by any means. I think it's a little heavy on the buttering hops and could use a little more flavorful finishing hops.

Appears that Victory has made it to Alaska. 12 oz bottle with a best b date of Oct 18, 2011. Pours a hazy copper with a thin white head and some nice lacing on the glass.  Smells like a pine forest with some aromas of sweet/caramel malts.  Taste is just a perfect balance of hops and malt. Upfront I get that delightful piny resin bitterness that moderates with the follow through of sweeter malt flavors. Some hints of caramel. Lingering lip-smacking bitterness from the pine-delivering hops. I can pick up some citrus on the back of the tongue. One thing that really sets the taste apart here is a delightful spiciness. Very bitter with a spicy kick. Strong malt bread-like backbone for superb balance.  Mouthfeel is lively and crisp--well carbonated with the hops keeping things lively. Also some slickness from the hop oils. Never a dull moment in the mouth with this beer.  Overall, a sentimental favorite, so I'm somewhat biased on this one. But I think it deserves it. Really.

345,1005,Jugs_McGhee,3.35,"33cl brown glass bottle with standard pressure cap served into a generic hefeweissbier glass in low altitude Los Angeles, California. Reviewed live.  A: Pours a 2.5 finger head of good thickness, decent cream, and pretty good retention. Colour is a semitransparent copper-gold. Generally appealing.  Sm: Very hoppy (shocker). I suspect they dumped a bit too much cascade into this one. Some bittering hops are present, but it smells tame enough. The aroma is mild in strength.  T: A very pleasant full barley foundation is well hopped, but fortunately the bittering hops are not overdone. To its credit, it's quite well built, but problems are obvious balance-wise. It feels like they created a bland 2-row barley foundation and just dumped hops into it. It works to a point, but has drawbacks. The primary issue is that the open and finish have minimal flavour while the body carries everything. Structurally, it's problematic, but it does work. I do like it, but there's work to be done.  Mf: Smooth and wet - perchance a bit too wet for the style and flavours it's meant to complement.  Dr: Very drinkable. It avoids the two common pitfalls of IPAs: it's neither too coarse nor too bitter. I'd recommend it to fans of the style as a rare example of a well done IPA. That said, there's work to be done. I look forward to trying more beers from the same brewery.  [I lost my initial rating since BeerAdvocate changed the weights of each category without notice. I'd surmise I intended to give it a B- or B based on the review above].  *** 06/02/18 2nd impression from a can:  6.7% ABV. IPA. ""Malt: Pilsner, Vienna, Medium Caramel Malt. Hops: Cascade, Centennial.""  Malt backbone is very caramalt-emphatic, which renders it too sweet and biscuity, taking the focus away from the hops. Floral hop character is there, but I expected better given the use of two classic C-hops. In terms of Cascade and Centennial-hopped ales, I'd sooner take Sierra Nevada Pale Ale or Bells Two Hearted, respectively, but this isn't bad. Some hints of soapy off-flavour do emerge as it warms. Hints of grapefruit and concomitant naked bitterness.  More hop pungency and less caramalt would help this along.

345,1005,TheBrewo,4.3,"This brew was served from the draught at The Distillery in Victor, NY. It arrived in a pint glass a toasted amber color. The head was frothy, the color of a latte. This left spotty lacing and demonstrated decent retention. Once it receded we were left with an accordingly spotty film over the beer for the remainder of the glass. Carbonation appeared to be average, and no sediment was noted. The aroma sung of sweeter hops. Within, there were bright florals that took a trip close to the border of citric territory. From this citrus there was a slight bittering, of lemon and grapefruit rind. There was also a spice noted, with a peppery booze and sting of ground mustard. Malts here were a bit darker, with a light toasting to them. As we sipped, the flavoring began with sweet hops. This did also include a citric quality, but here it was of lime. The beginning also boasted of a bright honey, adding further sweetness. The middle moved forward with darker grain that had a solid cooked feel to it. This section was otherwise grainy and steely. The end offered even darker malts, with a renewed sweetness and black tea tannin-like quality. The finish was also peppery, with faint washes of booze to clean the palate. The aftertaste was of grassy hops, coppery malts, and a faint toast. The body was medium and the carbonation was medium to high. The feel to each sip was deliciously cooling and coating, with no real drying character. The frothy film left helped impart a nice creaminess to the mouth. The abv was appropriate and this was a highly drinkable beer.  Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the darker feel to the malts in the taste. This remained so without crossing over into the realm of the Black IPAs, which can have the malts overshadowing the necessary hoppy components themselves. This brew did exactly the opposite, in that all the flavors of the traditional IPA were retained, with big hops being showcased. Additionally, the aroma was clean throughout, and the tannin like slickness at the end helped to put this beer above the competition.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Healthy doses of carbonation under the one finger head.  With all this activity I’m very surprised this head isn’t more impressive. The white head leaves only a little bit of lacing on the side of the glass.  Smell: The bitterness of the hops is very present on the nose. Some real snap to this devilish drink. The flavor profiles are all similar though. Just some notes of orange zest, lemon, and a little bit of a floral note.  Taste: Interesting peppery spice to the drink on top of the hops. It finishes with a pronounced wheat flavor, although it isn’t cereal tasting like adjuncts. This demon is not scaring me off very well.  Hops are very present, but they aren’t bold. This IPA has the hop flavors, but not the zing or bitterness that should accompany it. The malts aren’t really there. The orange is most pronounced with the floral and herbal flavors. It is still a good drink.  Mouth feel: Probably the best part of this beer. It is incredibly creamy and rich. Just a slight amount of bitterness prevents the dryness to mess with the feel. Almost chewy, really, it is that big.  Overall: While the flavors aren’t nearly robust enough to make a “devilish” hop profile, it is still an enjoyable beer.

Wow, what a nice balance. Not too little, and not too much of anything. The mouthfeel is very smooth, almost creamy, and compliments the wonderful hop nose and long puckering aftertaste.

Taste - Follows the taste pretty closely with grapefruit, pine, grassy, and some citrus hops. A bit of spice almost like there's some rye used in this. A decent malt backbone provides a nice balanced taste, adding some sweetness, caramel malt, and again a bit of beady flavor. Malt is nicely done, keeps the hops from being too crazy bitter.

I bought a sixer yesterday at Lowes OIB, and as soon as I smelled my first one, I thought ""of fuck, another malt bomb!"" :-(  Unfortunately, my taste buds confirm my suspicions. I really used to enjoy this beer--long before I got into locals--so this experience is a real-life experience in disappointing realism and the apathy of nature. Only because I used to enjoy this beer do I not rate it lower.  It's malty--feels like it, tastes like it, etc. It's just a disappointment--where are the yummy, citrusy hops to which I've become accustomed? This malt bomb is no hop devil! To hell with this devil!!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Had the retention been better, the score would have been higher.  S: Malt caramel smell is strong. Nice hop aroma. Nice grapefruit and pine.  T: Hop is strong but at the same time it is surprisingly malty. Grapefruit and pine upfront, caramel and grains on the back. Nice sweetness to finish.  M: Medium to thicker bodied.

345,1005,Kegatron,4.08,"On cask, via hand pump, @ the Victory Brewing Company (Downingtown, PA) on 8/5/11. Served in a pint glass.  Pours a deep clear copper in the glass, topped with roughly 1 ½ fingers of stiff bright-white head. This retains at nearly a full finger, staying rich throughout, and drenching the sides of the glass with heavy creamy lacing. The aroma is loaded with grassy, spicy, earthy, and piney character, which is undercut by a layer of fresh smelling grapefruit zest. Backing notes of caramel and bread fill out the back of the nose, while just a touch of light alcohol heat creeps out as well as this warms.  The taste is bright feeling with a fresh citrus bitterness that possesses a pronounced earthy edge to it. This however is immediately cut by the malts, with notes of toasted bread and caramel doing a nice job of balancing this. Hops return in the quite aggressive finish on this though, with notes of pithy rind, spice, and resin all contributing to the strength and dryness of this. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a fantastic creamy feel and an overall smooth crispness that glides along effortlessly despite the assertive hop profile and light alcohol warmth that is present. Just a great cask feel here that really contributes a lot to this.  With its American take on a British IPA, Hop Devil seems to be a rather polarizing beer with some people. Cask however is the way to go with this beer, as it really pops those hop flavors, helps smooth out the earthy and aggressive edges of the profile, and generally keeps that close to 7% ABV drinking rather nicely. A pint on cask here is just a given for me when it’s one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Good drinkability.  O: This is a great session IPA, and pretty widely available at east coast bars with is a plus.

Lotta Hops up front, floral in the beguinning, followed by an almost sour grapefruit citrus. THe beers called hopdevil and it certainly lives up to the name. A tad more malts would make it more balanced but this is America, IPA's arent balanced.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, well carbonated, leaves some oil-y hop resins on lips and cheeks. Yummy.

345,1005,mikechance,2.71,It has a nice rusty orange color and a little 1/3 - 1/4 inch head. I'm picking up a lot of malt and spice in the nose but nothing hoppy or any of the citrus you would expect from an IPA. A very malt dominated beer with very little of the hop characteristics I expect from an American IPA. Its medium bodied and has a little sour and acid aftertaste. This is much closer to an old ale style or brown ale than anything else.

Nice, but just not what I expect from an IPA.  M: Medium mouthfeel, pretty smooth.  O: Not bad, but a bit of a disappointment. This is just too mellow, more of an APA than an IPA.

S: The aroma is very piney hop centered. There are also notes of orange zest, some spiciness, and mildly sweet malts.  T: Piney taste, surprisingly doesn't finish dry. You can taste the citrus and spice throughout the sip. you can taste the alcohol contain when you breath out after taking a sip (almost seems like it should be higher in ABV).  M: this beer was fairly flat, but im not marking it off cause it was sitting in my frig till today when i could find the proper amount of time to rate it (maybe could cause the head to lose some thickness?). Beside this particular beer this beer is mid body and mild carbonation (as the bubbles rising from the bottom would suggest).  Drinkability: I could have a few of these, but I rather not im trying to keep em' for a while and enjoy them separately.  overall: this is a great beer, expensive but worth it.

345,1005,SickGnar,4.2,"A: Dark coppery, almost reddish, amber. Good size off-white head. Maybe some chill haze. Good retention and superb lace.  S: C hops – citrus, rind, and resin. Caramel malts with slightly sweet toasty grain and doughy bread. Hints of darker roast as it warms. There is plenty of enough here, especially in the malts, but the hops could stand to be a bit more danky and pungent.  T: Nice! Bit initial citrus. A third juicy/fruity – orange, tangerine, grapefruit. Two thirds rind. Backed immediately by loads of firm, rounded caramel, doughy sweet malts, and toasty grain. Great interplay of hops and malts. Middle to end has a good does to spice to come in to play with the lingering malty sweetness. Some earthy, grassy/herbal character shows though at the end and leads into a long resin finish. Playing with the hops in the end and finish are some soft dark roasty notes – burnt toffee, a touch of darkly roasted grain, and smidge of chocolate. Toasty grain note really shines as brew warms.  M: Over medium body with soft, yet firm carbonation to match. Definite dextrins, but not syrupy. Plentiful hops and touch of darker roast malts lead to a drying finish. Slight alcohol warming after a while.  D: Very Hoppy, yet balanced too. Big and robust. Great heft and feel with a nice level of complexity. This is a great IPA.

Taste-very balanced.. really has everything here for what a IPA should be, a nice dry crispness with a abundance of bitter floral and citrusy hops. The sweetness from the malts make there presence, but for sure the hops are in charge. I like the balance of this brew and the fact its not trying to destroy your taste buds its not trying to be the most bitter brew out there. Its smooth and at times creamy with just the right amount of sweetness and IBU it’s a very good IPA.  Highly drinkable and highly recommended. I only wish they had this on tap here my hometown.

A- Pours a nice copper hue that sits rich in the glass. A big foamy light khaki head forms then fades down slowly to leave a dense foamy film to cap the liquid. Some sticky lacing.  S- Sweet bready malt, some spicy hops present. Very malt forward. Quite appealing. The aroma is felt on roof of mouth.  T- Similar taste to what the aroma would indicate. Lots of sweet bready malt, spicy rye bread. The hops are quite spice centered, but have a touch of pine and light citrus zest in the end and finish. The hops start to come out of the malt body as it warms.  M- Medium bodied. The body of the beer does linger well, as well as a mellow bitterness. Mildly drying on palate. Simple.  O- A good IPA overall. Very easy to drink. Lots of balance here, if thats your thing. I prefer a hop forward IPA, so thats why I'm rating the otherwise solid brew down a couple notches.

Mouth puckering hop bite.  D: Slow drinker. The bitter bite dictates it.  Atmosphere is pretty solid. Nice color tone, foamy head, carbonation, substantial lacing. Nose is a great combiation of malt and hops... a little uncharacteristic. Nicely thrown in there is an indistinct nutty or woody tone and a heavy floral character. Hops rule the day.

Best by date on newer pour indicates May 6, 2013. So it is well past that date. So much for the drink fresh mandate. This beer has been in a cooler in the dark for most of its life.

S: Moderately nice hops. A little boring. Caramael?  T: Not very impressive. Subdued flavours and sort of watery. What are there are American IPA piney hops, with plenty of juicy citrus to keep things interesting. It's by no means a bad IPA, just a thoroughly middle of the road one. Aftertaste is lightly dry and relatively brief.  M: Nice. Robust, chewy, and carbonated. Astringent hops before the smoothness (wateriness?) kicks in.  O: Overall, a decent, drinkable IPA.

345,1005,Lightbearer2012,3.83,"I have had this before and liked it but it was always close to the enjoy by date. I found this fresher batch (enjoy by Sept 26 2011) at one of the local liquor stores that previously didn't carry it so without hesitation grabbed a sixer. With the menacing devil staring me down I start this review.  12 oz bottle poured into a stemless wine glass. The color is a gorgeous amber with a khaki head that faded rather quickly. However a quick swirl around the glass brought it back but again no retention.  The aroma is a little weak to me with sweet caramel malts coming out and like a few others have said a spice I can't identify but it is not off putting.  The taste is really good. It starts off sweet and malty but then the hops introduce themselves and interrupt the malt but not rudely. The previously mentioned mystery spice is part of the flavor as well but like the aroma does not hinder the enjoyment. Make no mistake, the finish is hops and a pleasant bitterness but certainly not as hoppy as the name Hop Devil would suggest.  The mouthfeel is creamy and lightly carbonated but the carbonation fades quickly which disappointed me a little. Not too thick, not too thin and the flavors do work the palate nicely.  Overall I love this beer when fresh but only like it when its a little dated. I love a lot of Victory's beers and fresh Hop Devil is no exception.

Off-white head, disappated fairly quickly, but left pretty streaks of lace. This beer really pops in the glass.  Quite a mix of scents in this one...spicy...can't quite trace what it is, followed by tropical mango, grapefruit, pine, a bit of caramel malt.  The taste was a bit of a letdown...the hops were there, but they felt more grassy and dry, not the oily, tropical or grapefruit kick that I like. The spicyness was tame and the sweet malt I smelled seemed subdued a bit. The aftertaste threw off the flavor...can't quite put my finger on it, but it felt a bit unbalanced.

345,1005,BMoldy,4.23,"From the second the liquid leaves the bottle, I'm loving the look of this beer: rich copper with a robust, light brown head. Great retention and lacing all around. An initial whiff suggests herbal hops, with a slight pine and citrus aroma as well. A further examination reveals strong roasted malt waiting just underneath. Taking a sip, however, it's the malt that sweeps in at first, covering the palate in a delicious wave of toasty goodness. Almost at the same time, the hops creep in, allowing the bitterness to build in the center and back, while an interesting fruitiness comes in from the sides. Perhaps the best part, though, is the mouthfeel. Medium weight, but not sticky or clawing... maybe a little chewy, it's incredibly smooth yet has just the right amount of carbonation to enhance the beer's individual flavors.  Not my favorite IPA in terms of taste, but beautiful nonetheless. Although my bottle was still ""good"" (Exp. 8/29), I get the feeling this is one of those beers that really demands to be consumed ASAP; the flavors felt a little muddled, and I felt like the hops needed to stick out more... I don't know what it is about the mouthfeel, but it really struck me for some reason.

Smell is not too strong compared to other ipa's. Columbus brewing ipa is much stronger. Taste is not too bitter, rather smooth for an american ipa which I like. I also prefer bitterness as well but this over is nice. overall I could definitely get this beer again.

345,1005,kylehay2004,3.67,"Two finger head, Smell is hoppy, pine-like and not overwhelming. Taste is spicey, with hints of caramel. Full bodied and dry aftertaste. The hoppiness is very strong on the initial taste and there is no letting up from there on. I think the A+ given by ""The Bros"" is generous.

345,1005,harrymel,3.01,"Best by jul 17, 2011  A: pours a rusty orange ale with excellent clarity. Single finger peanut foam leans into a thin quilt of the same. Ringed lacing.  S: very malty for an ipa. My initial thoughts are how this reminds me of an ipa Called Indica by Lost Coast IIRC. Rich sweet and caramelly malts are complimented with some ruddy, grassy hops. A hint of aluminum. A little too malty for the style IMO.  T: good bitter pinch up front melts into a spiced malt profile. Fairly interesting. Some tastes of orange peels, hibiscus flower, tea (orange pekoe, room temp). More reminds me of an amped up amber with all the malt action.  M: medium to full bodied for the style. Low carb. Slick finish with a decent resonance.  O: looks good, smells and taste are more like an amber or red ale to me. Can't say I really care for this one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,GrizzlyBeer1282,3.42,"A: Fake amber orange-ish color.  S: Smells very hoppy, but at the same time it smells like a relative farted in your face.  T: Luckily, it tastes much better than it smells although it is very bitter. Too bitter even for a hophead like myself. Only reason I even drink this beer is because it has the perfect alcohol content at 6.7% abv. The only reason I'm even reviewing this beer is because of the mouthfeel which is came as a real shocker.  M: A real spicy bite to this one. Very bitter but the bite is so fierce that it numbs the tongue enabling one to drink a second one. This is by far the most appealing quality to this beer.  O: If the other aspects of the beer were up to par with the alc. content and the mouthfeel, this beer would be an A+, however, since the mouthfeel is so exceptional I'd have to say this aint such a bad beer overall.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Zaradog,3.94,"Visual: One finger loosely packed head that dissipates quickly. Beautiful clear amber color that absolutely glows when you hold it up to the light.  Aroma: Grapefruit, apricot, and I also get a little hint of the smell that most Belgian beers have (not sure what it is called). I’m picking up a hint of bready malt in there as well. Not bad, but not knocking me over with hop aroma either.  Taste: More malt on the front end than what I expected. And really, I don’t pick up very much hops until the finish which comes in with a thin yet harsh wave of bitter. I feel like there is something there that plays to the middle sides of the tongue, however every time I roll it over the sides, it immediately starts to fizz up which distracts from the taste. By the way I pick up a Black Tea aftertaste on the exhale.  Mouth Feel: If I keep this beer running straight down the center of my palette then it feels good, reasonably wet and the taste is just … plain. If I roll it around it fizzes up something terrible and goes really dry; yes more tastes come out but they are overshadowed by the fizziness.  Drink-ability: I could try to extract out and find as much flavor as possible and end up completely disappointed because I can’t get the beer to hit on all cylinders. Either it goes fizzy and dry but tries to present its flavor, or it goes down quick and smooth with only average flavor… certainly nothing impressive enough to live up to its name and label.  Impressions: I’m just not impressed. I think this beer is unbalanced to a point where it can’t live up to its potential. As far as I’m concerned, I have to believe this is a work in progress, and that the brewers are still perfecting the formula. The hops are definitely in there, but they constantly have to fight to be noticed. Yes I would buy it again. Yes I would enjoy it. But I still think something is keeping this beer from living up to its true potential. Maybe it was nearing its end of life... it only has two more days left on its Best By date.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,jazzyjeff13,4.62,"A 12oz bottle with no visible BB date. I acquired some bottles of this a while back - the off-licence that sold them stocks some cheap beer past it's use-by date. This leads me to suspect that the bottles I have are quite old, but they've been stored well and hopefully will have mellowed nicely. I love the hop devil on the label.  Poured into a Delerium Tremens chalice. A rich coppery-amber hue with some floating sediment (I tried to keep it all in the bottle but failed). Good carbonation. Produces an off-white head of thick, creamy foam that lasts for quite a while before reducing to a surface layer. The aroma is intense; a powerful cocktail of malt and aromatic hops. Notes of pine underpinned by sweet, grainy malt and a notable whiff of alcohol.  Tastes of intensely bitter hops with a rich malty backbone. Notes of aromatic pine/resin, sweet malt, brown sugar and hints of roasted grain. Alcohol adds a warming sensation. Mouthfeel is tingly and full-bodied but very astringent; the texture is almost syrupy. Strong bitter aftertaste of pine and malt.  An intense hit of hops - hardly anything brewed in the UK can provide such a sensation. Impressive, with stacks of character. Due to the age of the bottle I wonder if some of the hoppy notes have faded away (esp. citrus), but the bitterness is still overwhelming. Fantastic, and well worth sampling.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,BBP,3.9,"A- Hazy dark hop orange color. Well carbonated. Thin head and no lace.  S- The aroma isn't really working for me. There are hops and all, but there's also a very strong fruit aroma like old tangerines. It still smells promising, but that feature is a bit off-putting.  T- Floral hops as well as tropical hops. Moderate amounts of grapefruit and citrus. Hops deliver a ton of flavor, and a moderate amount of bitterness. There's a lot of sweetness to even it out.  Biscuit and caramel malts make up a considerably large part of the aftertaste. Almost to the point of leaving the hops buried. This one delivers hops and then malts. There's a pretty balanced load out in this.  M- Medium body. Creamy from just the right amount of carbonation. Dry and sticky finish. The drink coats your mouth in no time at all. A tad of alcohol heats things up.  O- An IPA that is definitely leaning towards citrus. It also adds malt for balance, but remains a hop forward IPA. I enjoyed it, but I'll opt for more IPAs with more pine flavor in the future.  Worth checking out.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,CHickman,4.42,"Pours clear amber in color with a very creamy 2 finger tan head that faded very slowly and left great foamy lacing; a really good looking beer.  Smells of floral hops, flowers, grapefruit, citrus hops, orange peel, lemon, light brown sugar, wet bread and caramel; very hoppy nose overall, which is sweet and delicious with the right amount of malt and grains to balance it perfectly and still let the citrus hops control the aroma.  Tastes of floral hops, flowers, grapefruit, citrus hops, orange peel, lemon, mango, tangerine, brown sugar, pepper, spices like coriander, toasted grains, Coke, and caramel or syrup; the hop spices are dominant, but as I said before there are enough malts and grains in the mix to balance it out perfectly. A really great tasting beer that hides the alcohol well and lets just enough spice run wild to make this an extra bold IPA.  Mouthfeel is creamy and oily slick with medium carbonation, a medium body and an overall feel that is hoppy with some alcohol bite. A really nice beer, that's fruity, hoppy and really easy to drink for an IPA. High drinkability for a beer of this caliber, this is a high recommendation.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,AlCaponeJunior,4.2,"Orange to copper colored with just a slight haze. Head and lacing were fine.  You can smell a nice blend of hops along with a touch of spicy malts and a bit of citrus.  Now I might be going out on a limb here, but I did not find this beer to be such an assault on the taste buds as some of the other reviews have indicated. I found it to be bold and full flavored, yet very nicely balanced. Hops are forward but not overpowering, bready malts are complex and complimenting. There's a nice spiciness and a touch of fruitiness too.  Feel is relatively full bodied and incredibly smooth and drinkable.  This is one damn fine beer. My only complaint is that I didn't buy more of them on my last trip to the store.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,Alieniloquium,3.43,"22 oz. pour at the Food Shack in Jupiter, FL.  Appearance - Two finger off-white head atop a deep amber body. Pretty clear with good lacing. Dark for an IPA, but otherwise nice looking.  Smell - Not a lot of aroma. Some piney hops and a bit of bready malt. Sometimes I have trouble getting good aromas when I get a beer on tap, but this is even lower in aroma than that.  Taste - Piney hops first with a toasty malt midrange. I wish it was hoppier, especially because there isn't a lot of citrus to it. The piney hops make it feel less... brisk? A long, almost smokey bitter finish that lingers.  Mouthfeel - Good carbonation and medium bodied. It's easy drinking and tasty.  Overall - Not bad, not great. Hardly this side of good, really.

Off-white head is 1/4 inch on the pour but quickly recedes to a thin ring around the edge with a few islands of head. Little strings of lace here and there. Clear, orangey-coppery-reddish colour.  Aroma is pretty subdued. What can be found is mostly hops with a touch of malt.  Strong hop bite throughout. Almost no presence of malt detectable. Strong pine with hints of grapefruit. Bitter hop aftertaste is long lasting.  Oily mouthfeel with little carbonation.  Overall it's ok but not great. Pretty average unless you just like straight hops flavour with no complexities or malt backbone.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,ErmahgerdPhD,4.15,"A - Pours a deep ruby color, or possibly a rich rich amber. No visible carbonation, but there is good head retention; approximately 2 fingers of off-white (slightly tan) head. True to the name, the hop resins create a nice thick sticky lacing around the glass.  S - This beer smells pretty darn good - spicy, piney hops and some caramel malts come through. The malts give it a nice sweetness that is definitely not present in all IPAs. The smell is somewhat understated for an IPA, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  T - The hops definitely come through in a few ways in this beer. There is a certain earthy, piney and spicy (almost peppery) taste to the hops, which really comes through well and adds a degree of complexity not there in some of the purely hit-you-over-the-head-with-bitterness hoppy IPAs. There is a solid caramel malt backbone, which holds everything together nicely and offsets some of the hop bitterness nicely. Having said that, there is a lingering bitterness that bites for just a BIT too long for me. Other tastes are slightly bready and citrusy, but nothing I can outright identify. This beer also doesn't hide it's ABV very well; I would've guessed it to be a higher ABV if I was judging on taste alone.  M - This beer is thick, almost creamy for an IPA. The name again is alluded to with the mouthfeel, as the resins coat your mouth and keeps a layer on your tongue throughout the experience. This beer has an almost oily quality to it, which suggests a long boil with the hops.  O - Definitely give this beer a shot if you love hops, it will give you a pretty unique experience with some of the spiciness that it brings to the palate. I would buy this every now and then and break them out to two beers per time that I drank; this is definitely not meant to be put back all night (especially at 6.7% ABV).",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

The body is a deep ruby hue, with good clarity. The lacing is sticky and plentiful. Low levels of carbonation are seen.  S: the aroma is a very hop forward notion, but there is a nice subtle balance of malts. The malt gives off a warming character. The hops are high pungent West Coast citrus flavors, as well as a piney, resin flavor.  T/M: The flavor is very resiny, with good malt backbone. Give the beer depth and complexity. The hops do a nice job at bitterness, but fall a bit short in the floral flavor department. The mouthfeel is full for the style and the lingering finish is very full of hop bitterness. Flavor resemble the character of a German Bock. Well rounded taste.  O: A very nice IPA offering from Victory, but within the freshness code, the hops have lost a touch of there flavor.

The taste of the beer has an interesting spicy hoppiness to it. There is a light maltiness in the flavor as well but mostly a very strong hop flavor throughout.

A nice big off white finger head that is slightly soapy and has some pretty good sized bubbles. Body is a basic clear amber getting more into dark brown with some very tiny small rising carbonation from the bottom. Simple, and good looking with next to nothing for lacing.  Bouquet is just standard and solid. Muted but noticeable hop presence that has a kind of malt dryness. Some type of dry grain powdery malt sensations, but with an almost grassy feeling left behind.  Taste is good bodied, somewhat syrupy but all the taste and flavor is in the aftertaste and finish, and it's quite enjoyable. Great baked brown dough bread and spiced hop, slowly building on the swallow. Repeated sips bring out some orange, but then the swallow still brings the lingering aromatics. Big but not overpowering, dry, with a husky sense almost.  This will do in a pinch it's quite tasty and I never seem to complain if there is any to go around.

Behind that I get some sweeter, slightly caramel like malts peeking through. It doesn't feel sweet at all even though you seem to get a pretty strong malt presence.  The taste shows more of those bitter, citrusy, juicy, hop flavors throughout the beer. I get grapefruit being the most present, with some orange flavors coming through as well. Again the malt comes through pretty well, but manages to show little sweetness. The finish is dry and bitter with more of the grapefruit flavors lingering.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being a little below average. Overall it's a pretty solid beer with a bold bitter, hop profile to it.

""Enjoy by Sept 14, 2011"" so I'm on time. I'm greeted by about a finger of cream colored head. Looks thick and dense, but doesn't last long. Nothing exceptional in the lacing dept. Laser etched bicycle at the bottle of the glass is trickling bubbles through the gorgeous amber/orange maintaining a thin layer of head throughout the full tasting.  The aroma is more pine than citrus to me. A bit of the sweet malt comes through as well. For lack of a better term, it smells balanced.  The taste is hop forward without being overpowering. I get the citrus being mentioned in other reviews. Sweet malt comes through after the initial prickle of the hops wears off. The aftertaste is bitter, begging for another taste. The mouthfeel is what impresses me the most. It's creamy. Thick, but juicy. Love it, but playing devil's advocate it may not suit every situation.  This is a great balanced IPA that I don't feel like I have to concentrate on to enjoy. No feature overpowers the other leaving a very easy to drink beer that doesn't leave you wanting.

I smell some strong and sweet caramel malt, more than I like in my IPAs.  Taste: Again, nothing too special. This is tasty beer but nothing stands out to me, some light citrus hop flavors up front. The caramel malt is too strong for my liking here, a little sweet on the aftertaste.  Overall: A solid IPA but frankly, I expected more. I understand this is a matter of personal preference, but I just don't like such a strong malt presence in IPAs. I also have some Hop Wallop I'm waiting to try, I hope the malt there is more toned down than this.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,snaotheus,4.35,"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass  Pours a medium amber color, no visible sediment, moderate head, looks like it's going to lace quite nicely. Small amount of fine, slow carbonation. The beer just looks thick and juicy. Smell is refreshing, malty, somewhat piny. A little bit of citrus and and flowers as well.  Taste is dominated by hops (which is good), bitter dry pine, grapefruit rind, quite tasty.  Mouthfeel is dry and light, not sticky at all. Overall, very good beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,mattjv,4.17,"Pours a dark copper color with off white head.  Smell is everything one expects from an IPA. Grapefruit and orange citrus are most prominent, with piny notes. Sweet malty backbone comes through but the hops take center stage.  Robust bitterness is immediately present on the taste, doesn't wait till the finish to come out. The bitterness is far from overwhelming however, and works well with the rich caramel malt palate all the way through. bitterness becomes more pronounced on the finish along with all the hop flavors present in the aroma-grapefruit, orange, and pine. Lasting bitterness on the aftertaste is assertive but still keeps me coming right back for more.  Light/medium body with appropriate carbonation to match the malt. Overall a solid IPA and very balanced. Try it if you can get it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,fox227,3.81,"I'll come right and and say that this is one of those 'balanced' IPAs that I don't drink a whole lot of. I'm much more of a fan of hop-forward brews where the malt just kind of peaks through and says ""hello"" and then goes away. With this beer, the hops just kind of say ""hello"" and then the malt takes over things. This results in a more drinkable brew for most people.  A: Nice dark golden/red color with a cream one fingered head.  S: I don't get much from the smell at all, just a bit of bready malts.  T: The hop presence is sufficient, but no where near dominate. Thankfully the malt character is excellent, featuring sweet biscuit, caramel, and a bit of black tea like bitterness. The balance between sweet and hoppy is spot on, so the brew doesn't devolve into syrupy territory at all. Well done!  M: Nice carbonation tickles the tongue and sharp bitterness numbs for just a second or two - not too intense. The head is creamy and smooth. Impressive.  O: This is a fine IPA that I would drink any time, even though it's not exactly my favorite example of the style.

Head on this is about 1/2 inch thick and frothy/bubbly. Nice lines of carbonation running up from the bottom of the glass to the top...Spectacular looking beer. Lacing down the glass with every sip.  S - Citrus and hops, but not overpowering... they are subtle. Traces of clove... may be? Sweet and aromatic.  T - Just, phenomenal. What you would expect from a ""hoppy"" beer, but the hops don't smack you in the face. Some grapefruit in the aftertaste... a refreshing and delicious beer. One of the best tasting American IPA's I have ever had. The malts smooth out the power of the hops ever so elegantly...  M- Smooth... easy to go down... with good after taste, but not residually ""sticky"". Certainly not a beer you need to chew, nor one that you need a chaser for... and the ""after sip"" is pleasant enough that you can further enjoy the beer.  O - One of the best American IPA's I've ever had.... if not one of the best beers I've ever had. Well balanced and delicious.

There is an off-white head which dissipates fairly quickly, leaving solid lacing.  S: Smells overwhelmingly of citrus and hops. There is light pine bitterness behind a range of tropical fruit flavors. I’m also getting a bit of a grape smell.  T: Upfront it is very sweet and fruity. It tastes very citrusy, even orange-like. This quickly fades to an herbal flavor. There is a little light malt flavor that lends a little bit of balance to the drink. There is a strong bitterness that develops mid-sip and persists long into the aftertaste.  M: Relatively thin and well carbonated.  O: A decent IPA. It is both fruity sweet and hoppy bitter.

This is usually the opposite of my preference in an IPA, but it works magnificently here. In fact, I was looking for something with a nice caramel malt flavor when I made the purchase. I had it between Dale's Pale Ale and Victory Hop Devil.  The mouth feel is flatter than I remember, but not to be considered a fault.  Hop Devil is a well conceived and a delicious IPA that I return to quite often, particularly when I'm looking for a great caramel taste.

Had a head, but I let it warm up a little (so I could taste even more hops), and the head is gone now.  Smell: pleasing. Slight smell of hops, which does not act as false advertising.  Taste: a delightful, balanced flavor of hops and malt. It doesn't have an overpowering flavor of hops (see Stegmaier IPA), but the hops presence is definitely there, even to my sometimes shoddy tastebuds.

Thick hop aroma and some biscuity malt behind it. Devil-ishly hoppy, but balanced with a strong malt back. Enough hop bitter to satisfy west coast cats, and enough balance for others to appreciate.

Not overwhelming, but I can tell it's there.  Hops, of course. There's a lot of bitterness, but not very malty. The hops definitely overpower. Victory really wanted this to be hoppy.  Bit of an alcohol sting at the back. Good, thick, creamy body.  This isn't my favorite IPA. It's a little uneven, and bites in an unpleasant way.

Light pepper linger and a hint of European hops. Smooth, even mouthfeel.  Good peppery flavor in this one, balanced and tasty. It’s mostly one dimensional that’s a good easy drinker.

T : Starts with a fresh baked bread malt that blends into a hoppy middle. The hops are piney and have a tingling sensation (fresh!). The finish is like the smell, with a quick hop that is slightly citrus flavored, but not overwhelming or even prominent. Really light finish that is crisp and enjoyable.  M : not much lingering besides that tingling from the fresh hops. even feel and good body that ends a little fast.  Overall a pretty good ipa, but not overwhelmingly hoppy.

Decent retention and good lacing. Looks like a million bucks in my tulip!  S: Loads of grapefruit, flowers, a little spice, and sweet caramel malt goodness. The aroma is very nice but it's just a little weak. I have a feeling this would be dynamite fresh on tap.  T: This IPA is just bursting with flavor. Explosion of bright, juicy grapefruit & citrus hops, a little floral, grassy, and resinous as well, flowing beautifully into the rich malts - sweet, caramely, a little buscuity and just a touch of spiciness from the alcohol. Finishes long and smooth with just the perfect amount of bitterness to keep you coming back for more. Fantastic.  M: Thick and chewy, oily and a little puckering. Medium carbonation keeps it smooth and full on the tongue.  O: Probably one of, if not -the- best ""single"" IPA I've had yet.

The appearance is nice and thick with a light coppery color.  I like 'em hoppy, but some IPAs go too far and pick up a aspiriny flavor. This comes right to the edge, letting the full flavor of the hops come through.  The mouthfeel is, without the hyperbole, the best I have ever experienced. Full and thick feel, with a somewhat oily finish that goes down the hatch perfectly.  This is a beer that could get me in a lot of trouble if I let it.

S: Piney and floral with maybe some citrus biting through in the aroma. I think the several PBR's before this are numbing my senses a little.  T: The perfect blend of malt backbone with hop bitterness. Mildly floral and citrusy. Certainly not too much that an average macro drinker couldn't be swayed into appreciating heaven here on earth.  M: It is a somewhat creamy with a rather mild carbonation. I think it suits this beer well.  O: This is my go-to beer. I drink more of this than anything else. In my opinion, its the best readily available beer at a decent price where I live (central PA) and I think everything about it rocks.

Appearance: Poured a light amber color with very little head and specks of lacing as the glass empties itself.  Smell: Immediately a trifecta of hops, malt, and roast make their way permeating and enticing my senses. The malt makes a large, sweet presence balancing the grassy, floral hop aroma with a hint of roast barley and alcohol to round out the nose.  Taste: Very sweet caramel lends itself, used to be enhanced by the delectable essence of hops. This devil is spicy. An alcohol presence presents itself only to be taken over by the malt and hops. To finish, there is a bitter bite of hops, a good cadence to bring about the end of a tremendous symphony of flavour in this beer.  Mouthfeel: Chewy, pliable, it works itself into every crevice of your mouth and a bit dry.  Drinkability: Sensational, this beer excels in it's ability to be consumed.

Not much else here.  T: Lots of malt and bitter grassy hops. The sweetness of the malt dominates this beer with flavors of caramel apple. The bitterness comes in a very grassy earthy form but comes across as watered down.  M: Very good mouthfeel, the brew is thick and full.  O: The strong malt profile of this beer mixed with the grassy hops makes for an interesting take on the IPA. For me it was too sweet and the mix of grassy bitterness was not too enjoyable.

345,1005,Huhzubendah,3.59,"Growler shared by Lunch. Thanks Paul!  The appearance is simply fantastic. The beer appears transparent and amber / orange in color, with nearly two inches of dense, creamy head that coats the glass with a thick sheet of lacing.  The aroma brings a balance of hops and malts, along with some toasted notes.  The flavor is tangy and bitter, with malt in the driver seat more so than hops. Very fresh, crisp and clean on the palate, as this growler was just filled. While I appreciate balance and realize that a beer doesn't have to be over the top to be a good brew, HopDevil just lacks the hop presence required by the style.  The feel is decent enough, but I find myself distracted by the hop to malt ratio.  Overall, a middle of the road offering. There are many better IPAs that are easily accessible.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,output01x,4.17,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  A slow pour yields a huge 2.5-finger pillowy off-white head. The body is a clear new panny copper with a light amount of rising bubbles. After a few minutes, the head recedes to a light covering but leaves decent lacing throughout consumption.  Spicy and floral hops scents explode from the head. A light maltiness is also noticable. Fresh and strong, the hop scents do a good job of preparing you for the flavors awaiting.  Strong spicy hops hit the tongue and refuse to let go until they are pushed away by a nice lingering bitterness at the back of the tongue. Like the nose, a light maltiness is also there, but not to balance the hops. Instead, the malt compliments the hops and let's them do what they do best.  Light bodied with nice carbonation. This beer coats every bit of your mouth, helping the hops to do their job.  This beer is rather straight-forward and doesn't leave much complexity to be disected. Instead, it excels in drinkability with a decent bitterness that isn't overly strong.

345,1005,thebrood1987,5,"Looks like a pretty malty IPA. I smell hop fruitiness that reminds me of the Cascade hop with a grapefruit like fruitiness. I also get an amazing tropical smell reminiscent of mango with some sweetness from the malt. The taste is just as awesome that starts with a spicy hop bite that quickly gets run over by the burnt caramel malt and then the dry bitterness comes through with that grapefruit like fruitiness from the hops.  I'm glad they decided to pick this beer to have the different malt backing to balance the hops out. This malts remind me of a lighter Yakima Glory so that the hops shine through more. It's actually an interesting take on an IPA because of that burnt, roasted caramel malt taste that goes along with the whole flowers they use. I love that they use whole flowers in their beer it gives all of them a distinct Victory taste... this one being one of their very best. Another A plus for Victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Soneast,3.77,"Pours a slightly hazy, orange to amber color, developing a 1/4-inch, cream colored head that dissipates quickly to a sudsy ring, that leaves a fair bit of lace.  Aroma has a very nice hop character, some tropical fruits and citrus with a slight herbal aroma. Some malt character is evident in the way off toffee and bread-like graininess.  The flavor seems to be a bit less hop forward than the aroma. Either way flavors are definitely tasty, with some more herbal hop characater, as well as a hint of citrus. Some nice caramel flavors follow through, ending on pleasant, slightly bitter note.  Man, I need to find some of this fresh. Granted, it is only a couple months old, but I think the hop flavor would be far more satisfying with a fresh bottle. That said, I still really enjoyed Victory's HopDevil.

The taste is very cracker like with more on the side of roasted flavor. It's very balanced yet not quite as hoppy as I was imagining it to be.  M - Light bodied, good light carbonation.

Lace is not sticking very well.  Smell is mainly of yeast or bread. Maybe a hint of citrus. A bit sweet.  Taste is like the smell but not so yeasty. The malt sweet comes first and then the very mild citrus hop flavors of maybe a tangelo or some other sweet citrus fruit. Then the yeast.  Mouth is good. The carbonation never leaves this and the malt bill keeps this silky rich to the end.  This bottle is dated ""Enjoy by 05/23/11"" So it's probably fairly fresh.

345,1005,Boitnott,4.17,"Victory brewing has not been readily available in areas that I have lived, so my experience has been limited. Lately I have been trying some more from them and they have been very good. I picked this one up at the local store and poured it into a DFH snifter. At a glance, it is a dark orange color with a small white head crowning its impressive contrast. The head dies rather quickly but a small amount lingers, and not much lacing is present. Upon smelling the beer, a rich scent of pine hops and a faint bit of citrus hops are present. Underneath these impressive notes is a slight rich amber malt smell, that balances rather well with the others.  Like most great beers, the smell mimics the taste well. The nose tastes mostly of the amber and pale malts, with a slight bit of citrus and mostly pine hops. These hops begin to take over in the finish and do not go away. This quality of lingering hop taste has come to be a determining factor in an IPA for me. I find myself missing it when other IPAs are lacking. The reminiscent hop taste after the beer is swallowed leads into the next sip, and thus accentuating the excellent bitterness.  Overall, it feels pleasant on the palate, and the carbonation is just enough to compliment the flavors and bring them out. Victory keeps impressing me, and those who enjoy that level of bitterness between IPAs and DIPAs will enjoy this a lot. It would also be a great transition to those who are timid to enter a world of bitter hops in well crafted American IPAs.

345,1005,BeerPhan86,3.83,"This has been a go to IPA of mine for years, finally getting around to reviewing it!  A - Pours a slightly hazy ruby amber with a one finger light tan head. Lacing is not very sticky but there is good retention on the head.  S - Hops with some kind of funky bitter aroma that is hard to identify as noted in other reviews. Noticeable caramel as well.  T - Sweet caramel up front followed by a good amount of bitter, earthy hops. Not very much fruit/citrus going on in this IPA, it is more of a bitter and floral IPA. Very well balanced nonetheless with a crisp, dry finish. Not as hoppy as I usually like in my IPAs, it is a bit darker and sweeter but I do really like it.  M - Just a tad undercarbonated but very smooth and crisp. Not too oily or sticky on the lips.  D - The alcohol is well hidden and it tastes like more of an English style pale ale than an American IPA. I could drink several.  Overall, probably not what you would expect if you have tried Victory's Hop Wallop. Still very enjoyable and worth getting in a sixer. Still, I found the hop profile to be rather underwhelming given that the beer is named HOP Devil. A bit misleading for what you actually get.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,DrDemento456,4.1,A - Dark orange amber in color. The carbonation is spot on with another half inch of head. Poured just right!  S - Aggressive hops with bitter pine and grapefruit. I get a mild malt but indeed it smells hop forward.  T - It quite good in fact. I do wish the malt profile was a bit stronger to balance the intense hop blast on my tongue but with a name like Hop devil it's indeed hoppy. Malt is there to balance and make it drinkable but it really wasn't too balanced still enjoyable.  M - Light to medium the bitterness was spot on.  Overall I liked this beer. I found it even more hop forward than my current favorite DIPA Mojo Risin. Well done victory!,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

The mouthfeel is good - nice balance between the flavors, and this is certainly a beer you could work with all night.  bank on it - the more a brewery brags about hoppiness with a beer's name, the more underwhelming the actual hop profile will be.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Color is amber with decent carb. Smells very mildly of hops, I must say that for a beer called hop devil I expected more hops in the aroma. slight solvent aromas as well. Tasted okay with good bittering additions yet slightly unbalanced towards the bitter end. Usually I go for bitter IPAs but this had little to no aroma to go with it so it was a bit un-enjoyable. Was not a bad brew by any means, but I wouldn't purchase it again",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Rschis16,4.67,"Honestly it's hard to find anything wrong with this beer. Looks great, being a deep orange color with a smallish nearly white head. Expected a larger head right out of the pour, but it leaves lacing on the glass without exorbinant head retention. Smells chock full of bold, full-flavored, resiny hops just assaulting the nose.  Taste follows suit and if your a hop head, you'll have a hard time not liking this one. It's meant to be super hoppy obviously, and it succeeds, but it also remains balanced throughout the whole taste and leaves behind a pleasant bitterness. Manages to feel creamy on the palate yet crisp in the finish.  The 6.7% ABV is hidden well, making this somewhat dangerously delicious. I'd be interested, purely out of curiousity, to see what would happen with just a tad more carbonation, although I think its pretty damn near perfect the way it is. For someone who loves a good hoppy beer, this is up there with the most solid of them all. And at a very reasonable price there's really a lot to love.

345,1005,Ryanm1,4.38,"Where else can you get a Victory Hopdevil Poured to you in a fresh plastic cup other than Reed's nightclub in Blue Bell, PA. I've had this beer many a times before but this review comes on the most recent indulgence at a local wateringhole/night club. The beer was a happy hour brew on draught poured into a plastic cup. Here the beer was a dark brown color with moderate. This beer was delicious as always. With German imported Malts this weights in at a 6.7% ABV. The first time I had this beer was at the Las Vegas Lounge in Philly. I was working as a File Clerk in Philly at the time and Victory was much less known in 2006. The beer still remains delicious and is still one of the best in the game.

345,1005,ccm414,4.5,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass.  A- Pours a clean golden amber. Only about a 1 finger head that does not seem to linger too long, but never fully disappears. The lacing it leaves is very good around the entire glass.  S- Very hoppy/piney scents. Some sweeter floral notes are also present with a little citrus. Not overpowering for an IPA, very balanced. I LOVE the scents this beer gives off, simply enjoyable.  T- The hops give off a great bitterness that is complimented with the sweet malt, much caramel noticed as well in the sweetness. It lingers with some spice flavor. This beer really does give a little something more with each taste, fantastic! The finish of this beer has a great bitterness, nothing that lingers really leaves a bad taste.  M- The carbonation is lightly tingling. More of a medium-to-light bodied beer here. Very pleasant.  D- I have become a fan of this from Victory. This a very drinkable IPA. Drinks like an 'all-purpose' IPA, but there's just more to this one. A good beer to frequently reach for.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Lunch,3.46,"I received a fresh growler of this from the brewery as a gift. Served in my Victory HopDevil imperial nonic glass.  Pours darker than many IPAs with a nut brown with some ruby hues.  Aroma is mainly malts with some nut notes and some grassy and earthy hops.  This certainly not a hoppy IPA, but the taste is nice and it is extremely drinkable. There is some slight bitterness and hints of earthy hops, but the malt shine through. This is a balanced IPA, but I prefer my IPAs to be unbalanced with a massive amount of hops.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,veinless,3.16,"Appears a slightly hazy orange red, looking pretty much exactly like tree sap. Head is fluffy and a bit off-white, with below average retention and inconsistent lacing around the glass.  Smells tropical at first, with pineapple and mango coming to mind, and then leads to an overripe sticky fruit sugar smell. An herbal dry bitterness lurks in the background, and while it doesn't go particularly well with the tropical forefront, it is something different and nice nonetheless.  Taste changes gears a bit, as the front is quite a bit more bitter than expected, and is composed partially of citrusy rind. The malt stickiness detected in the nose doesn't really come out to play at all in this beer. The tropical flavors are very subdued on the tongue, and the herbal, leafy hop oils dominate overall. I don't particularly like the character of the herbal notes for the hops in this case, as I find them a bit harsh and unbalanced, but I can appreciate how well their specific taste has been brought out. I would have liked a bit more malt character from this though. It isn't so much a ""too bitter"" situation as it is an unpleasant bitter situation. Citrus comes out near the end again under the tongue, sour orange in particular, which is a nice saving grace. However, the utter lack of flavors behind the hoppy bitterness is a real letdown, as I was expecting so very much more.  Mouthfeel is very good, with the beer flowing easily and staying crisp and refreshing the whole way through. The drinkability is helped by the dry nature of the finish, but hurt by the lack of balance in the beer. Abv of 6.7% is respectable for the strength of flavors in the beer, but in this case I think those flavors just aren't compatible with my palate.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Small carbonation bubbles rise to the top throughout the duration of the drink  S- Citrus scent of hops and a hint of sweet malts  T- an abundance of flavors. Hop flavor throughout is balanced nicely with the sweetness from the malts. Surprisingly complex.

Smell is along the lines of dogfish head 60 minute. Citrusy and earthy hops almost smells like the air in an open field after a long steady rain.  First sip and initial impression is right in the ballpark of DFH 60 min. However similar the hop profile seems to dogfish head, there is a difference that pushes it over the top. At first it was hard to place, but about halfway through i figured it out. The HopDevil doesn't hold back, from the initial taste to the lingering finish, it's hops dominated, all the way.  While this is not a beer for those new to hoppy beers, it is one that any IPA lover should give a shot, especially if they enjoy the dogfish head and sierra nevada torpedo hop profiles.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,TCHopCraver,3.68,"HopDevil pours a pretty copper-gold color into my large snifter glass. Its head is a thin, one finger tall from an agressive pour and is the lightest shade of khaki. The body is just a hair cloudy with copious carbonation bubbles moving quickly upward. The lacing left on the glass is fine and curvy- Tolkien Elvish style.  My buddy, who lived in PA for 3 years, told me that this was brewed with German malt and I swear I can smell a bit of a Dormunder-esque aroma to the bouquet. This blends with spicy, earthy American hops for a very unique IPA aroma. Herbal and floral scents are prevalent, although I also smell a touch of sweet citrus when I breather in deeply.  The taste is rather similar to the smell with the German malt harmonizing well with the earthy, spicy hop presence. Very faint flavor of citrus introduce themselves mid-sip. The finish knocks the grade down a notch for me, as an extremely earthy, resiny, metallic bitterness lingers on my palate without any malt sweetness to counteract it.  The hop float really leads the mouthfeel parade. The bitterness from the beer somehow hits more points on my palate than any other IPA I've had. It's probably on the light side of medium bodied, but its quite hard to tell because the puckering nature of the hops dry out my palate so completely.  I feel like I am being a wuss. I love bitter IPAs, but I am really just not loving the way in which HopDevil is bitter. That is, the finish is so earthy, grassy, resiny, and metallic that I don't love how the bitter flavor compares to bitter flavors of other IPAs. If this had just a little more malt balance and a little more of a citrus presence, I would like HopDevil considerably more.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,SuperSpy,4.42,"Poured into a pint glass from a 12oz brown bottle with a best by date of 04/13/2011.  A - The beer is a mostly clear, orange-amber color, with an off-white, two-finger head. The head dies down pretty quickly but a small amount of rising bubbles ensures that a nice cap of foam remains. As the head lowers it sticks to absolutely every interior surface of the glass. This doesn't just look like a good IPA, it looks like a great beer.  S - There is a hint of toast with a sweet citrusy hop aroma that really takes the show. The citrus aromas are lemon, grapefruit, and dried herbs with a bit of pine hidden in the background. I could get more descriptive but I really want to move on to drinking this beer so I'll just say that this aroma is very, very good.  T/M - The beer has an incredibly smooth medium body. This beer is almost creamy, with the perfect amount of carbonation. The immediate flavor is citrusy with ruby red grapefruit and fresh lemon. Pine is also there but the fruit is most evident. The mid-point flavor gives way to floral, herbal, and earthy hops that ride in on a magic carpet of biscuity malt. The finish is earthy, a little spicy and dry. It seems like with every other sip I'm finding some new element to the hop flavors. This is definitely a beer that will keep you coming back.  D - Drink this beer. I always wondered if this beer was really as good as all the hype claimed. I have to say that although the hype is really high, there is a reason for it, and this is a very well executed IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,generallee,4.3,Presentation: It was poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a pint glass. The label lists the abv at 6.7% and it gives a nice description of the beer. No freshness date is listed.  Appearance: The body is clear with a deep orange amber glow. On top I got two fingers of light beige foam. This head has good retention and manages to keep a thin covering to the last sip and make some nice sticky and slick lacing on the glass.  Smell: In the nose I pick up notes of lemony citrus and pine floral hops with a deep sweet and malty underline character.  Taste/Palate: I get the same lemony citrus and pine like hop notes from the nose. They are up front and center on the tongue with a rich bready and brown sugary sweet malty backbone. Firm herbal hop bitterness slowly builds up on the tongue and slowly fades back off into the long finish. It has a solid medium body with a smooth feel and balanced carbonation.  Notes: This beer works a nice balancing act with supportive malt sweetness and hop flavor/bitterness.

The smell is fainter than expected. Mild but dominate hops. Sweet malt is not covered up. Nice balance. Pine and floral accents with a grassy and slightly citrus presense. A little lemon zest.  The taste is more hoppy than the smell. On the bitter end, but not extremely. Grapefruit and pine are in there with some floral and grassy elements too. Malt plays background music here but overall its balanced nicely for the style. Mild on the hops for the style which makes it very drinkable.  Its on the dry and bitter side with a slight watery character. Some of the flavors are muted and become hints. There is a bitter aftertaste that is medicinal like asprin.  Awesome for the style.

I don't know how many tmrw I've had hopdevil, but each for some reason I get surprised by how good it is compared to the big west coast IPAs I've been drinking. The beer is definitely redder than most Ca IPAs meaning it has more caramel and toasty malt flavors. The hops though really sing, they have a rich woody and earthy edge, probably from the cask dry hopping, and it is just a strong manly flavor. If they made a cologne from this beers bouquet I would buy it. It has the citrus peel, freah cut grass, and damp oak leaf thing going one. The malt sweetness and crackery toast provide the perfect counter balance to the beer. Even though the beer was definitely undercarbed it still had great texture and wasn't the least bit syrupy.

I must warn you that in the past 3 days I have had Hopslam, Nugget Nectar and Jai Alai and I am not normally an IPA drinker.  A- Pours a nice clean dark orange. Pretty good looking for an IPA.  S- Not so much. The previous 3 I mentioned assaulted you with hop smell...always reminds me of a brew day...this one assaults you with bubbles you have to stick your nose in to try and get the ""promised hoppiness""  T- Actually pretty clean. By no means the blast that other big IPA's carry but it delivers clean and crisp but subtle hops. I don't know, with the Nugget Nectar and the Hopslam I'm under the impression that you gotta 'drink this now!!' as the IBU's are gonna fade rather quickly. There is no push to get this brew out to people so I think that this could sit for a while and be the same...or maybe it already has sat a while for all I know.  M- good, like other nice IPA's (I guess, since I really don't drink them)  D- Not bad. I would not go out of my way for it, but considering it is available everywhere here in Florida and Victory is usually pretty solid, I would pick it up again.

A: Pours a clean copper hue with a light effervescence, a decent head that lingers, leaving solid lacing from start to finish.  S: Sweet carmel nougat, toasted grains and earthy malts, finishing with just a hint of grassy hop, but falling well short of a solid IPA - coming across much more like a well done Pale and less like a well hopped IPA.  T: Similar to the nose - reminds me a lot of some of the fresh hop pale ales you see released around the fall - very fresh and tasty with some nice hop in the mix, but dominated by sweet toasted malt and cereal grain. Don't get me wrong - there's a nice earthy/grassy hop presence, but with a name like ""Hop Devil"", one would expect the hop to be dominant and not just a part of the mix.

Smell is hops, piney (good) w/alcohol (sadly). I like a well-hidden ABV but all things considered this is nothing to prevent a hopehead from wanting to try this beer as it is far from boozey in flavor.  Taste is lightly piney hop forward, and finishes off chewy with more citrus notes and some other notes. This may have been a little too cold when I started and got better as it warmed slightly.  Mouthfeel is average. Nothing bad mind but nothing spectacular. A little hard on the palate but it's called Hopdevil so what do you expect?  Drinkability is average. Again, just nothing really spectacular about it. I'll say this: there are many IPAs on the market and many of them are good and this is as good as any of those.

345,1005,Jadjunk,4.33,"#72. Very much looking forward to my next Victory Brewing following their wonderful translation of the Saison Du Buff Brew that took me by surprise a couple of weeks ago. Victory claims by the label that the HopDevil is the real deal; ""Bold, spicy and menacingly delicious"". I'm ready to check that for myself...  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a mug at room temp.  (Appearance) Pours a frothy 1.5 finger depth head. Retention is above average; it gradually dies down but slows as it reaches the surface, leaving a consistent shroud of appealing thick to thin foam on the surface. It doesn't break until my first sips, very nice. Lacing is certainly there, medium thin, rough and sticky; really good qualities. Color is a deep copper orange and considerably clear concerning the fuss about hazy consistency. Very small but plentiful carbonation can be seen throughout the glass. This beer looks to have some bold substance and an abundance of character; i'm genuinely intrigued. 4.5  (Smell) A markedly sweet aroma complete with very noticeable light low-acid citrusy fruit smells, like grapefruit mostly. Hops aren't nearly as bold as I had anticipated for something claiming itself the ""Hop Devil', but the combination gives a pretty fair representation of both characteristics of the American IPA. Beyond that lies a fainter smell of sweet malt. Hops smell especially floral and sweet in this brew. Biggest critique? Not pungent enough. The hops don't really punch through the smell, leaving no strikingly audacious notes to be recognizable. The smell is incredibly friendly and really companionable for sweet beer drinkers desiring light tastes and smells. My opinion: turn up the nose! 4  (Taste) Not as expected at all! Hops shine through on all courses in different ways. First impressions gather some piney and floral hops tied with some fruit notes and some roasted grainy textures. The balance is wondrous. Finish is very hoppy without becoming draining; when paired with the more subtle grapefruit tones, this beer begins and finishes with intriguing interest and complexity. Even more entertaining are the roasted and toasty malts that peek in in the very end of the brew as the hop intensity regresses. Taste is wonderful and complex. This may not be the king of hop city, but it is evident that some considerable hop quantities went into this brew with respect to the balance of flavor, none of which are underrepresented in this brew. 4.5  (Mouthfeel) Little carbonation influence leaves the first impressions smooth. Texture is very light grainy with consideration to the medium body taste this beer certainly has, much of the subtle sting to the tongue comes in on the finish, which is characteristically crisp and dry. Nothing overly sweet nor sour in this beer, but all flavors and senses have a fair representation and balance throughout. 4  (Drinkability) Medium body and an enormously complex taste make this beer very nice to drink, but the hop presence may slow speed down a bit. Regardless, a fair 6.7% ABV and consistent balanced mouthfeel makes drinking this beer a nice luxury. It is worthy of at least a second round, a sixer on a good night would be well satisfying with a friend or partner nearby. Perhaps not party worthy, but this beer has far too much character and flavor diversity to play pong or quarters with; it is easily one of my favorite commonly available American IPAs. 4.5  Verdict: No doubt a wonderful IPA, especially when it rears its head in a common grocer store, it's a no doubt take home winner; A wonder to behold and consume. Worthy for anybody who drinks beer both as a habit and as a hobby. I'd go for at least a sixer; you won't regret the purchase.

Tastes wonderful-unlike other IPA's which simply try to blow you away with hops, this IPA has a strong hop presence but enough malt backbone sweetness to compliment the hoppy bitterness.

345,1005,rembrant,4.3,"Look is gold amber with a generous head that's creamy colored and this does a good lace. Aromas feature a herb resin whole cone hop scent and some citrus. Good and rather inviting Flavors are not quite the hop array of it's big brothers,Hop Wallop and Yakima Twilight . This has a soft caramel supporting a hop side that has some citrus-grapefruit,a sort of english oak,and a bit of pine resin. Finishes rather dry with a lingering multi-hop aftertaste. There is less of that "" dank buds"" to this hop profile than in Yakima Twilight,though there's a resinous pine thing.  Mouth...The light toast caramel malts can't subdue the hop devil,but we don't ask for that. Instead they provide a sense of substance so the zingy hop show never gets watery. Just right carbonation and a fine lingering finish make for a brew that's drinkable in general and a joy on a hot day. Has just enough balance and restraint to keep a whole beer nature.  ---catching up posting reviews I'd written...",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,LacquerHead,4.13,"It had a floral hops smell mixed with something citrus. The aroma was a tad bit weak to me. It didn't have that commanding hops aroma I was expecting.  Nonetheless, the taste was very satisfying. It had a floral hops taste. I couldn't point to anything specific as far as the hops goes. It was like a blend of citrus, pine, & flowery hops. There was a dryness to the flavors. It also had a smooth taste, possibly from the malts.  M/F: dryness with a fizzy carbonation. Very smooth on the palate  D: very drinkable. To me it had a soft dry taste that made me want to keep drinking.  Conclusion: I would buy this again. I didn't think this was as hop intensive as other AIPA's I've had, but still it think it could satisfy someone with a hops craving. In the widely available craft beer category, I would say this is a solid purchase.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,SHODriver,4.63,A: gorgeous bronze color with a decent amount of thick white head S: my nose isn't doing well at the moment but I'm getting a lot of malt smell from it. Very sweet and misleading. The smell burns a little toward the end so you can tell there's some hoppiness going on. T: Very good flavor starts off with some caramel sweetness to kick things off which quickly fades to the hoppy side of things with a good transition to some earthy spicy notes. It finishes at the swallow with an oily hop finish that coats the mouth and leaves you wanting more. M: Good carbonation that may be a little on the heavy side which leads to the mouthfeel being a touch on the thin side but not bad. D: I really like beers like this so I could see myself drinking a few of them. It certainly won't be hard to finish it off.  Overall: a very good beer for you to get a hop fix. the only bad thing is the oily hop flavor seems to coat a little too well to after a couple sips you can't appreciate all the flavors. Instead of the up front sweetness it just tastes sort of watery until a new wave of hop flavors come roaring in. Still a good beer considering that though.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Hoppiness seems to hit you up front in the beginning (just barely) but I think that's moreso of the expectation of extreme hoppiness with a name like HopDevil. The name and the smell will make you think it's a strong Ale, but it's actually not...nice little suprise. A good drink.  Appearance: orange/brown  Smell: Strong, earthy, hoppy  Taste: Smooth, picked up the citrus at the finish  Mouthfeel: perfectly smooth, not what I was expecting at all  Drinkability: Was a little nervous at first, I like strong Ales but the initial bitterness usually gets to me, until I have a few more drinks.

I prefer more of a citrus sweetness to my IPA, which this has, but it does not jump out at you - this has a more malt based flavor, even a bready taste, but the hop bite is their sticking to the taste buds.

Some mild grapefruit and orange zest up front followed by a mellow biscuity caramel backbone. Fairly bitter finish with hints of spice and lots of pine.

345,1005,joelbb14,3.68,"This is a very interesting beer to me. It is certainly not one of my favorites, but still a very quality beer from an objective point of view. I bought it hoping to find something like an IPA but alas it was much maltier than I had expected. Still good though, definitely has a broad array of flavors.  Appearance. Clear and very orange, head is extremely light and goes away within one minute. Leaves no lacing worth mention.  Smell. Certainly malty, but not a ""hoppy"" as I expected from a beer called ""HopDevil."" It smells fairly sweet as well, and I would say it is also pretty roasty.  Taste. It actually tastes almost exactly as it smells. Roasty, malty, and unfortunately for me, lacking in Hops. It is slightly bitter, but that is not the main flavor that comes through. The first thing I taste is the maltyness which is then overtaken by a citrusy sweetness (alcohol content possibly) and finally a little hops at the end. Not bad, not great though.  Mouthfeel. Mouthfeel is close to perfect, not super carbonated but very fitting for the style.  Drinkability. The drinkability has taken a hit because of how malty and roasty it is. I really can't see myself drinking more than one per sitting.  Although this is a good beer, I am, shall I say, disappointed. This is like getting the wrong salad dressing. Say for example I like Italian and Tomato Vinaigrette. I ask for Italian and expect Italian but instead I get the Tomato Vinaigrette. It's a flavor I don't expect which makes it strange and a little disappointing. I expected this to be super hopsy but it wasn't. I like the beer but it is not what I had expected.  Note After Review - I just looked at the date, it is past its ""drink by"" date.

Smell - hops, caramel, citrus zest, a nuttiness, malts  Taste & Mouth - The beer is perfectly carbonated and it feels very smooth and creamy on the tongue. It has a sweet malt taste with lots of hops and caramel. There is also lots of citrus taste and some notes of pine. I'm also picking up on some fruit esters. It finishes with a sugary sweet then bitter hop aftertaste that you can feel in your cheeks even after a few seconds have passed.  Drink - A good that I'll be happy to have again.

Grapefruit and orange peel in the middle. A little peach. Finishes with a nice hop kick. Notes of citrus.  Slightly creamy. Drinkabilitiy can be a little better. (Due to the creaminess and the ABV being in the ""middle"" range.)  Overall, this brew is worthy of a try but I wouldn't go above and beyond to acquire it. With a name like ""Hop Devil,"" I expected something with more hops. Hop Devil is more of a malty IPA.

The scent is pure IPA: citrus & hops.  What sets this beer apart from the other IPA's is the taste...You get that hops kick in the front, not overpowering (which is good) and then finishes with a very slight malty sweetness.  Some IPA's are either overpowering with the hops (which is fine, depending on what you are thirsting for at the moment) or finishes with a sweetness which overpowers the hops. This one, in my opinion, has the right mix in the right order.  This beer will have you wanting more but be careful, at 6.70% abv, it sneaks up on you!

Beer is slightly hazy and contains only a few streams of visible carbonation. Retention is good and lacing sticks like glue to the sides of the glass.  Smell: Hop aroma is pretty sweet and tropical. Pineapple, mango, peach, and orange are the dominant scents. There is also quite a bit of malt in the nose, as well as a touch of bready yeast that is a nice compliment to the hops.  Taste: Very creamy texture and a big punch of hop bitterness. The hops are definitely dominant from the start, but the malty body detected in the nose finds its way into the mix towards the end. I'm definitely getting more pine and citrus than I got in the nose. I really enjoy how the smell of this beer takes you to one end of the spectrum, but the taste sends you cascading towards the other!  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, with a creamy finish offset by a bitterness bomb. Decent malt backbone, but I'd say the hops run the show here.  Drinkability: If it is hops you seek, then look no further.

345,1005,nhindian,3.41,"Taken from notes from 9/26/10  Upon pouring the beer, it pours a deep amber, mahogany color with lots of natural carbonation. It builds about a 2-finger head, but that dissipates relatively quickly. The smell is a bit weak, but you get the usual fragrances familiar to other IPAs such as pine and hops, with a little bit of citrus. However, it doesn't have much oomph.  Once I dove into this beer and finally tasted it, I was a bit surprised. For being a 6.7% IPA, it is surprisingly refreshing. It feels light in the mouth and goes down very easily. However, the downside is that there is a disappointing amount of body. The flavor is there, but it fades quick and is relatively forgetful. The initial impression that I got from this beer is that is just feels kind of ""weak"".  Not to say that it is bad, necessarily. Just that from a beer called ""HopDevil"", I was expecting something with a bit more of a punch. I feel that if I were just getting into the IPA style, this would be an excellent jumping off point, but for someone who has explored many IPA's, this is one that falls a little short. If it were a bit cheaper, it would definitely be one of my go-to IPA's however, due to its great refreshing taste.

345,1005,stonermouse,4.42,"On cask at Rattle 'n Hum, and previously in bottle poured into a Sam Adams glass.  HopDevil pours nicely cloudy and copper-colored, with a nice and steady head.  The hop forward nose is quite pleasant, whether poured from the bottle or from cask. From the cask it was poured into a tulip, which trapped the aroma and made every whiff delightful.  The taste is great out of the bottle, and fantastic from cask. The cask added a bit of depth to all of the flavors, as expected, but the flavors themselves were similar. Nice fruity hops, slightly bitter on the back end but cleans up well and doesn't stick too much. This is some buscuity flavor throughout, but it doesn't interfere or compliment. It's just there.  The mouthfeel was superior on cask, but ever so slightly. The bottle is no slouch. Good and crisp, belying the cloudy look.  Drinkability is fantastic. ABV is no joke, but the flavor is good, and you'll thirst of this one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,thedoubler55,4.05,"Victory Hopdevil is one of the best Ipa's I have tried in a long time. Its appearance was very orangey with a great look to a beer drinkers eye. The smell of the beer was wonderful, with a rich smell of lots hops. The first taste of this beer was awesome, great rich flavor with great hops. Mouthfeel and drinkability is something that I take into great consideration with this beer, it was a wonderful feeling at first taste and definitely a beer that I will drink in the future.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,ChugginOil,3.86,"A- Amber in color with decent lacing and an inch of head that didn't stick around too long.  S- The smell is faint but I picked up on traces of citrus and flowered hops lingering throughout.  T- At first you're hit with a floral/hoppy blast that isn't too bitter and soothes the palate. there is minimal carbonation and could use a bit more.  M- Again, the low carbonation is present but with the all the hoppiness, it makes for a pretty good mouthfeel. Clean and isn't too thick  D- Six pack all day. This is at a decent ABV and goes down smooth making for a pretty good IPA.  Would seek this out again but I'm gonna try out some others before doing so.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,nickhiller,2.8,"A: clear amber, no visible carbonation, a brief and nearly non-existent head and no lacing.  S: sweet floral hops, roasted malt, a little funk. It actually smells a little bit like dog food, not sure what that means...  T: a little malt sweetness up front then a kind of generic hop taste, a little stale even. Super strong, dry, bitter finish. Kind of makes me go ""ackkk."" I have a taste in the back of my throat the tastes like bile.  M: very low carbonation, medium but almost syrupy body. A finish that is dry as a desert.  D: this made me a little sick.

S - Very hoppy and citrusy with slight hints of bread and caramel.  T - Hoppy bitterness from start to finish with spices, citrus fruits and slight malts. All flavors are balanced very well.  M - Medium bodied with high carbonation.  D - Very good and enjoyable IPA. Definitely try to get it draught instead of bottle. Heard that draught is a lot better.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,xnicknj,3.97,"12 oz bottle with freshness date poured into pint glass  Pours a slightly hazed auburn with golden tones. A light head dissipates leaving sparse film and lacing.  Some caramel and roasted malt in the nose along with a flair of bitter hops.  Biting hops right up front explode into a large amount of citrusy flavor. Grapefruit and orange are present, with a bit of sweetness creeping in. The malt backbone is apparent on the back end, with some caramel and bready qualities. Finishes with further piny hoppiness and some lingering dryness.  Medium bodied, higher on the carbonation, and a little dry. Easy drinking, quality flavor profile, and the alcohol is masked well. A pretty solid beer from Victory, but there's some better IPAs around for sure.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Bonis,4.18,"A - Amber in color with a small white head that fades rather quick, but leaves a fine lace.  S - Very hoppy in a floral way. A faint dose of citrus as well as a little sweet malt and surprisingly some metallic notes. Smell is somewhat sweet for an IPA, but decent overall.  T - Again, a little on the floral side, which I'm usually not wild about, but at the same time malts come through and no astringent bitterness that I find with some IPAs. It really works for me. There is a touch of spice as well. This isn't real flavorful for an IPA, but very very good nonetheless.  M - A bitter bang up front but smooth in the end. Bitterness fades quickly, which is a plus for me. Pretty low bodied with moderate carbonation.  D - All in all, this was surprisingly better than I expected. Not something I'll go out of my way to buy, but definitely worth a try. Masks the alcohol very well, so highly drinkable.

There is a very strong robust flavor to this ale as well as a fairly bitter taste. Fairly nice to try but not something I will be able to drink 2 in a row of. An entree of a steak would pair very nicely with this beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,FanofHefe,3.62,Poured from bottle into pint glass. Nice light orange color with a small head. Very light lacing.  Good hop aroma with some pine resin and citrus/grapefruit notes.  Solid hop flavor with a tasty hop/bitter taste and very little malt balance. Works well for this offering.  Solid IPA leaning more toward the hoppy side vs. the malty side.

As with most IPAs, citrusy and piney notes prevail...very pleasant.  Taste was exceptional! Huge caramel malt backbone that is quickly balanced with bitterness from the hops. Long, dry finish with a pleasant bitter aftertaste.  Mouthfeel was a little chewy. Mediocre carbonation but not bad.  I would have more than one of these in a row. Very satisfying and the somewhat high ABV is well disguised by the thick malty character and the high hop presence.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Sachsenfreude,3.06,"I usually stay away from IPA beer but my friend had some of these so I thought to give it a try.  It poured a pale murky yellow with a nice head and decent retention. The smell was almost all citrusy hops and then the taste....not something I enjoyed. Almost no malt flavors just powerful lemon rind hop bitterness with a sharp dry to dehydrating finish. Very unbalanced, tasted like sucking on a hop pellet. I know this is an IPA but damn, just over the top and lacking any complexities. Anyone could over hop a beer and produce the same result. The mouthfeel was very crisp, loose and dry, about what I would expect for the style. I will praise this beer for its drinkability though. Despite its obnoxious hoppyness, it's surprisingly easy to drink and that is quite remarkable in itself.  This really wasn't an awful beer but like so many of this style it seems to have lost touch with what a beer really is, a malt beverage, hops should be used mainly for the preservative qualities and complement the malts. I guess I'll never understand the whole IPA hype.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,NODAK,3.97,"Aroma is a mix of floral hops and a definitely sweet malt base. A little bit of fruitiness and caramel coming together.  Taste starts out fairly heavy on the floral hops, punching me in the mouth a bit but not abrasively. Behind that is a nice malt sweetness with a fruitiness to it as well as a definite earthiness to it as well. It's pretty well balanced, though certainly on the side of the hops as it should be. Finishes a bit resiny that lingers a while after the swallow. Clean. Good.  My verdict on this one is that this is a very drinkable IPA, and one that would placate both hopheads and those who would like some malt balance in an IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

A-Poured a beautiful copper amber hue with a two finger bone white head with nice retention and sticky lacing.  S-Nose is predominantly earthy and spicy English style hops.  T-Taste is hoppy, but more like a supercharged ESB than an American IPA. Not enough malt in the flavor.  M-Smooth and well balanced. Nice carbonation level.  D-This went down easily enough, but this is not close to what I prefer in an IPA. Perhaps this is more East Coast in style. If so, I definitely favor the West Coast interpretation. Taste improves as it warms.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Thorpe429,4.12,Super fresh at the brewery. Nothing like a good hoppy beer straight from the source. Reviewed from notes.  Pours a nice copper color with an off white head and some lace rings as it goes down. Nose brings a good amount of pine and floral notes as well as a bit of citrus. Taste adds some caramel but is mostly pine and floral hops without too much bitterness. Medium body and slightly dry.

M:Body is fairly thinner than medium with not much carbonation  D:This is a all right brew, the spiciness kinda of threw me off of it thou.

Light blended whiskey in there somewhere.  T: Slick mouthfeel with a eucalyptus hint right up front. Hoppy middle, piney mostly. Finishes smooth and malty. Bitter aftertaste.

T - Astringent citrus hops attack the mouth with stinging barage of bitterness. The hops turn to a spice and salty character that doesn't back down. Throughout all this hop extravaganza, a pleasant fruitiness comes out and adds dimension. Malt fights it's way through the bounty of hops to the make this drinkable.  M - Creamy with moderate carbonation.  If hops is what you seek, you will find it in Hopdevil. I would recommend you try as many IPA's as possible before trying this one.

M - smooth, balanced carbonation, clean finish D - 5.0 exceptional, never disappointing  With apologies to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle...  To 007, she was always the beer. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her style. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for HopDevil. All emotions,and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a beer-lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer.  They were admirable things for the observer -- excellent for drawing the veil from beer's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted palate was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his results.

345,1005,Bouleboubier,4.85,"This is one of the first craft beers I really got into, almost 10 years ago. Could be the weaning or a regional bias, but I find HopDevil to be one of the top 5 most-drinkable brews in my life. I love it swilled out of the bottle, in a plastic cup at Phils' games, or the ""correct"" way - poured into a pint.  Any time I have it out of a glass/cup, whether from draft or from bottle, there's always a beefy head - product of the hops used maybe, I don't know for sure. Fairly clean-filtered look, but an awesome deep reddish-orange hue - reminiscent, sort of, of the color of certain doppelbocks or maybe a Vienna lager.  The aroma is unmistakable - a little fuzzy-piney, quite pungent citrus, and perhaps a punch of malty sweetness rounding it out. Could be getting some toasted notes as well. Mouth-watering.  The citrus element bursts forth in the taste, taking on subtle grapefruit notes. A bold, spicy, vaguely peppermint, jolt invigorates (then scrubs) the tongue and a moderately sugar sweet malt base brings everything together (Sly Fox Phoenix Pale Ale exhibits similar characteristics). Hardly crisp or dry throughout - drinks a bit like IPA soda pop.  I've never had a moment with this beer where I wasn't in mad lust. Helps living in the area, where the price for a six-pack seems chucklingly low. I love it. Love it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Smell: Citrus and grapefruit are present, but piney hops are what is shown off the most in this smell. Very crisp, clean smell that leaves no doubt that this is an IPA.  Taste: I get a bit of caramel malt backbone up front, but citrus, grapefruit, especially piney hops are present on the back end. The hoppy bite is just glorious. This beer is everything an IPA should be.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Mouthfeel is a bit on the light side, but the carbonation is nice and fine, making this a pretty smooth drinking beer.

Just the slightest whiff of toffee.  Big and brash. Immediate bitter assaut overshadows the citrus and pine flavours. The bittering hops are the show here. There's citrus floating around in there, but your tongue is pretty occupied. Bitterness lasts long into the finish. A nice wet quenching finish leaves you wanting more.  Fine smooth mouthfeel.

The head doesn't stick around for long.  Smell: Piney hops dominate the smell. A bit of the yeasty Victory signature is also present.  Taste: Hits the tongue almost tasteless, but then some hops and malts come through. The malts don't last long though, the aftertaste is almost completely pure, delicious, piney hops.  Mouthfeel - Feels almost a little too light for the pine flavor this has. I expected it to be a bit thicker due to the smell. It still feels great though. Perfectly carbonated.  Drinkability - Very drinkable for an IPA. I like to pair this with the Korean treat Shin Ramyun - I love drinking IPAs and eating Shin Ramyun. A guilty pleasure.  Thiis is a great IPA.

Into my Sam Adams glass (Thanks, guys!), this one is a slightly hazed orange color with plenty of precipitating carbonation. Thin pale foam cap fades fairly quickly leaving minor lacing. Nose is pretty nondescript even after warming for a bit. There's definitely something hoppy going on there but it's more bready than anything. It's smelling more like an APA than anything at this point. Without checking, I'm guessing this is an English IPA, but then when I taste it... yep, definite biting citrus and piney hops. Now I'm scratching my head. This beast is definitely an IPA but it's not fitting neatly with my experiences with IPA's. A bit more sniffing and tasting and I unravel this beer a bit more. More sweet malt on the palate but there's a definite underpinning of bitter hops. Just a touch of boozy alcohol is there as well. Finishes dry and bitter, one part grapefruit and one part burnt toast. Throughout the mouth remains quite crisp and fresh, very complementary. The little bubbles that are visible in the glass translate nicely to the palate, keeping things crisp and lively. Drinkability is quite good; if not for the 6.7% ABV, I'd be tempted to call this one ""sessionable,"" though only for those who like their brew hops-forward.  Overall: A competent IPA, nicely crisp and enjoyable, rather in the middle of the road of the style. Definitely hoppy but plenty of malt balance there, too.

S - Delicious pine hop resin. Wow the oil-like resin in this aroma is unlike any other I've had. Nice piney sap aroma. Quite grassy as well. In the back there is a nice and quite noticeable grain bill that balances the strong hop presence. Nice spice permeates all over as well.  T - Wow. Very interesting. I must have gotten a fresh, fresh batch because the hop character is insane in this beer. Starts off with some nice grassy and almost dry hopped spice and hop burn. Slight citrus but overall grassy and of course piney. Very much an East Coast type IPA. Upon further inspection the malt shows up intermittently with the hop character. There is a slight sweet nature to it and some earthy tones but the hops dominate intensely. There is also some nice spice character in this beer that works well and together with the hops.

Really a lovely bouquet.  Sweet orange hit up front, followed by the fresh citrus, finnishing with bitter grapefruit. Just enough sweetness lingers as not to overwhelm with the bitter dominance.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,CascadeConan,3.16,"Hop Devil pours a wonderful red-tinged-orange, with a sticky white head with decent lacing.  The nose is much heavier on the malt than I initially expected with roasty and carmel notes dominate and then relinquish a small amount of citrusy hops.  On the first taste I experience kind of what the nose was whispering to my ears, sweet grain bill and a uniform bitter from the hops but nowhere near the character I expect from that style.  The carbonation is decent and ties things together but overall not an epiphany kind of beer.  I should have had a more level head going into this review, but from the small amount of hype surrounding this beer I had my hopes set on hops. I recommend picking up a loose 12oz bottle from you local grocer as an entire sixer of this stuff will put a dent in your wallet.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Apricot, pineapple, mango and earthy hops are most noticeable. The caramel sweet transfers from the nose and into the flavor with bready malt upfront which then transforms to a moderately piney and floral hop that fades into a bitter and lasting, dry finish.

345,1005,liamt07,3.77,"Bottle courtesy of 67couple, 12oz'er poured into a tulip. Thanks again Jon, BBD of November 15th, 2010.  Appears a rusty golden brown, relatively translucent with only about a finger or so of head even with some aggression on my part. Thin layer of head, sticky lace. Aroma is very nice, well rounded out with a ton of different citrus notes, lots of pineapple, lemon zest, a bit of grapefruit initially, some peach and as always, yer usual rich, and sweet caramel malt. Nice stuff, even for something not as fresh as it probably should be. Taste is quite bitter up front, and the hops are well known. More citrus here, and at points I want to think the bitterness borders on something potentially enamel ripping when fresh (for an IPA at least). Similar hop profile to what I've noticed in a variety of Victory beers (at least in Prima Pils and Hop Wallop at this point). Long bitter and drying finish. Good drinkability as I can't detect the alcohol, but the bitterness of this would likely prevent from several in succession.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,TKEbeerman,3.71,"It's Victory day. First up HopDevil.  A: Poured into my pint glass, this IPA pours an unusual rustic brown with a darker tan fluffy and frothy head that refuses to dissipate and is about 2-3 inches thick.  S: The aroma is really just above average. Toasty caramel malt is present. The hops are not piny nor fruity. Maybe some fruit notes are poking through, but not much.  T: The flavor profile follows suit. The malt shines trough and is very toasty and roasty. The hops add bitterness that complements this. Bitter roasted caramel malt is the best way to describe this brew.  MF: Carbonation is full, but the body itself is a little light. Not bad.  D: Drinkability is good too, but this brew isn't as satisfying as I was hoping.  Overall, HopDevil is an interesting little devil. Absolutely fresh, I'm sure it's much better. This bottle is a few months old. This brew is really drinking closer to a light barley wine, than an IPA.

It's almost as though it exists as two seperate smells one after the other, rather than coexisting. Interesting. T- Malty for an American IPA, but the hops were still very previlent. Very citrusy. The hops exist most in the finish. M- Full bodied for an IPA, and dry in the finish. Carbonation is perhaps a tad low, but not shabby. D- A very good IPA from Victory. While Victory probably doesn't have any beers in my top 10 favorite, it's in the top couple breweries, because they simply don't make bad beers. This is a borderline great IPA.

The piney spicy hop bitterness hits the tongue first. Earthy hops a bit later. Hard to detect the malt in background with the overwhelming hop attack. Fairly one sided. I prefer a more balanced IPA.  M/D: Medium body and carbonation. A bit to unbalanced hops make this one hard to drink multiple at a time, but good IPA when you want full on hops.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,OneDropSoup,4.1,"Poured into a tulip pint: A finger of thick, beige head that retains well & leaves webbed lacing at the top. Bright, rusty body, like tea. Hazy but translucent.  Smell is somewhat balanced between mild, toasty malt & a lemony smell. There's also a leafy, tea-like note that actually makes it kind of like an Arnold Palmer. After a while a slight organic, blue cheese smell develops -- different.  Plenty of lemon & orange flavors up front (zest & all), with a restrained tea coolness, turning just a little biscuity & ending with that bitter citrus zest again. Nice, not too sweet.  Medium-bodied, very smooth with a ""cool"" feel that comes with a mild tannic dryness.  Overall very nice: good hop flavors without being overly bitter. Also, the malt is just enough to balance -- too much malt or caramel in an IPA is a turn-off for me. Very good drinker. HopDevil was the first IPA I ever had, before I even knew what was supposed to characteristic of an IPA. It had been a while since I'd had a HopDevil, & I'm happy to report that it's a really quality example of the East Coast style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Was hoping for some citrus, but never found it. Regardless, smelled like I was in for something impressive.  Tastes like it smells. An earthy pine fills the mouth. A bit flowery, but nothing unexpected for an IPA.  This wasn't overly bitter like I expected. There's a crispness to it and certainly some hoppy bite, but it's actually pretty gentle.  I generally stop at one IPA at a time, but this went down pretty well for such a hoppy beer.

Great appearance, strong amber color, light head that tends to stick around. Great label very indicative of what inside.  The smell was the weakest point of this ale. Maybe because the head stuck around and trapped in the aroma I was not prepared for the taste. The smell was weak. I did not expect this from an ale so strong in hops.  Wow this is a strong hop filled beer with a dry finish. No doubt about it. Solid from start to finish. I might even call it angry at the start but balances as you drink through the first glass. Light sweetness to the taste and lingers through the finish.  Drinkability is a personal taste. I enjoy sipping a beer and not worrying if it is warm by the end. If I finish a couple of beers over a few hours I had a great night.

The body seems a little orangey now. The retention is very nice-- it forms a rocky landscape of bubbly mountains. The body looks thin, but the lacing is ok.  The flavor is big malts- slightly bready, big sweetness too. Some caramel malts and then a some hops come in. In the nose, all I get is some malts with a citrusy hop bite. The taste is muuuch sweeter than expected. The finish is kind of dry. A piney/resiny aftertaste... Some grapefruit comes through, especially in regards to the bitterness. A yeast note reminds me of the yeast used in English mild ales.  The body is oily but thin. Not thick at all, but lacking carbonation.  Not a beer I will get again.

D - Nice flow, it is assertive but quite gentle in the way it carries itself on the palate.  Notes: Another brew that introduced me to craft and hoppier brews some time ago...

T - Soft malty taste with some citricy hops that linger.  M - Very sweet and mild for an IPA.  D - Very enjoyable.

Smells of moderately grainy caramel malts with good amounts of floral and light pine hop aromas.  Tastes very similar to how it smells. Mildly dry caramel malt flavors kick things off and are joined quickly by pine hop flavors. Midway through the sip the hop flavors turn more earthy as the spruce notes fade, carrying through to a moderately bitter ending.  Mouthfeel is good. It's got a nice thickness with smooth carbonation.  Drinkability is also good. I finished my glass without a problem and could have another.

345,1005,salvo,4.12,"I've had many disappointing bottles of hop devil, so I was pretty sure I was going to opt for the other local brew on the drive through Pennsylvania, but the generous taste poured by the bartender at the Elephant and Castle convinced me a pint would be in order.  Beautiful almost clear golden color under an inch of head that melted slowly; lace all down the glass.  Nose is big pine and some sweetness of biscuit malt.  Wallop of a first sip, representing the keystone state well: aggressive coastal hops in a DFH 90MIPA kinda way but mellowing to a more midwestern APA style, certainly drier and less sweet and malty than the DFH.  On tap the devil is a totally different animal.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

A fantastic beer from a fantastic brewery.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,zimm421,3.62,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Appears a dark amber to copper color with a thick, off-white two inch head.  Smells oddly sweet. The malts really stand out, lots of caramel. There are also some nice hop malts, mostly pine and some earthy scents. Very well balanced overall. Something just seems off here. I thought maybe it was just the batch, but bought it a few months later and I'm getting the same scents this time. The taste is also fairly well balanced at first, but finishes very bitter. The hops don't seem to fit well with the rest of the flavors, and are actually kind of laid back, and slightly disappointing.  The mouthfeel is very creamy, full-bodied, and slightly below average in carbonation. It is actually quite drinkable because of the balance, but this would probably work better on an autumn evening, not a summer one. Overall, I've definitely had better, and this just doesn't seem to sit well with me.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Smell - floral and slightly piny hops, malt, and some light yeast. Strong grapefruit citrus.  Taste - Very balance IPA. Definitely bitter upfront but reined in by the sweet malt. Have no fear hop heads, as the malt fades the finish is pretty damn bitter. Virtually no detectable alcohol at all.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, oily on the tongue, with good medium carbonation. Favors linger on your palette.  Drinkability - very drinkable, this is an excellent beer and easily consumed in quantity.

345,1005,Prostman81,4.33,"A terrific beer. Pours a lovely amber-red color, with only a minimal amount of head. Hop aromas are more spicy rather than citrus. Definitely different from the usual West Coast IPAs I drink. The taste is excellent. A well done blending of malt character and hop taste. A smooth, almost sharp bitterness that persists throughout but never overwhelms. My tongue keeps dancing back and forth between the malt and hops. Love it. I wish I could pick up what hops are used in this, but the only hint I can say with some certainty is that there is some Chinook in here. I probably haven't been able to brew with the other hops used here (Nuggett? Some English hops?) The drinkability on this one is just what you'd expect for an IPA. Good alcohol content, and a great body that makes this a great drink even in hot weather.

Also some citrus notes mixed in. Taste starts off surprisingly matly with a bready, caramel sweetness. Not huge malt, but nice. Then the hops kick in. Floral hops, pine and earthy notes create a big hop flavor and citrus also contributes late. Finishes a little bitter and dry, but goes down very well for the style.

There was an ""enjoy by"" date of July 16, 2O1O on the front label, but it's so small you will need a magnifying glass to read it.  The beer poured a hazed orange color and made a 1 finger off-white head that lasted a few minutes before fading back to a thin rim. It's a nice bright orange when held to the light. Tons of lacing clings to the glass with each sip.  The smell was an array of floral, piny, and citrus hops. I can't wait to taste this.  This is delicious. Tons of bitter hops in here but it's really not that bitter, if that makes any sense. All the hop flavors are tamed by a mildly sweet malty backbone. You can taste the pine, the orange-grapefruit citrus, and the flowery hops, but it's not so hop overloaded that it hides the malt. It's a beautifully balanced beer with great taste.  Medium bodied with a smooth mouthfeel with medium to moderately high carbonation. I love the way this beer feels in the mouth, especially after it warms up a bit.  This is an excellent IPA.

Slight malt taste initially, then the hops kick in hard, giving it a strong, piney, hoppy taste with citrus elements. Light carbonation, good body.

345,1005,SykDoc,3.68,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. It pours a nice amber color and forms a 1/4 inch very light tan head that sticks around for a large portion of the drink. Carbonation is readily visible and just a little sediment.  The aroma is primarily a blend of pine and earthy notes from the hops. There is a healthy malt sweetness in the background.  The taste is again a blend of pine and earthy hops with some caramel sweet malts hanging out behind.  The mouthfeel is light bodied with a crisp carbonation. It almost seems watered down. The hoppy dryness that lingers is a welcome experience that brings up the value.

Not much smell otherwise.  Taste, however, is another matter. Wonderfully bitter and hoppy, with a sharp nip of the tongue as you drink it down. Lemony, with hints of tobacco and spice.

345,1005,bamadog,2.67,"Fries Cafe over in Cincinnati had this on tap the other night, so I thought I would give it a shot. Overall, Victory has only had a couple of beers that I feel are decent, and they tend to fall short for the most part. Review is from notes taken on 7/9/2010 and poured from the tap to a pint glass.  Appearance: Pour is a solid and consistent coppery color; starts with a one finger off-white head that fades to a thin, but full, cap; body has decent clarity and shows light carbonation bubbling throughout.  Smell: Very, very faint. Bit of a musty grainy presence with a dusty hop scent, and that's it. Not impressed.  Taste: Mostly tall, dry and slightly musty graininess; a very faint, near dusty hoppiness (these flavors make me wonder if this just an old keg or something...); bit of a sugary/candy-like sweet maltiness in the end.  Mouthfeel: Moderate carbonation in a light to medium body; a light and semi-dry stickiness lingers around on the palate, but mostly it's a moist finish.  Drinkability: Meh, I could take it or leave it... I would gladly give it another shot though if I was told that the keg was fresh and re-review this if needed.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

A decent malt backbone is also present in the nose. Not quite as juicy or overpowering as other IPAs, but pleasant nonetheless.  T: Piney and citrus hop flavors. Nice bitterness that is ultimately balanced with some sweet malt. Good IPA, just nothing outstanding here.  M: Resinous hops. Moderate carbonation and medium body.

345,1005,deapokid,3.83,"Replacing the amateurish review I wrote on 06/03/2007:  Liquid is amber in color with lively carbonation and a sticky, pillow-soft whitehead. This is the classic IPA look to a T.  Crisp, cool and bitter hop aroma is predominant, accompanied by a hint of apricot and a bevy of fresh floral scents. I'm stoked to reexamine this old favorite.  Alpha hops and a boisterous citrus sweetness are on the buffet. A mild dose of palate scratching hop dryness is also there with a hint of peppery spicing at the conclusion.  The mouth is smooth from front to back, concluding with a zesty and bitter hop scraping. It's all surprisingly well-balanced for the type and the hop profile is subdued enough to not turn off a beginner.  Overall, this is a nice starter IPA for those who want to ease into the hoppier brews and a very drinkable session beer. I'm glad I stopped in for a visit.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

The hops were a bit subdued for a beer dubbed ""hop devil"" but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The spicy/herbal hops come through most prominently and there is good a good balance with the malt. It is medium bodied with light carbonation which I enjoy. I am not usually a huge hop fan, but this is one I could drink all day. Very good and enjoyable beer.

345,1005,flagmantho,4.1,"Poured from 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: deep tawny-orange color with a finger of ivory head. This is an appetizing-looking brew.  Smell: rich aroma is surprisingly malty, given the name, but also has a nice amount of earthy hop to it. There's also an almost peppery character that works well here. Overall, I rather like it.  Taste: relatively sweet malt flavor with hints of caramel. Hops are earthy and bitter with some floral characteristics up front. This doesn't seem to me to be crazy-hoppy or super bitter, but I like it; it is actually rather well-balanced in my opinion. I'd definitely have this again.  Mouthfeel: medium-thick body with a nice level of carbonation for the style. The body has a little bit of a syrupy consistency which I think works here; it's silky but sticky enough to let the flavors linger.  Drinkability: I think the whole is greater than the sum of the parts here.

The smell has a sweet malt right out front with some floral and citric hop notes mixed in. Super solid malts right out front. They balance the hops nicely. Strong bitter finish is floral/herbal and refreshing. This beer is a little aggressive on the carbonation and a little heavy going down. I'm glad I can easily find this beer here in California.

The sweet malts are definitely overpowered by the bitter finish of the hops leaving a slightly dry finish.  D - Good drinkability, more on the sweet side than bitter, which if I had to choose an extreme it would be sweet, makes it easy to go sip to sip.

T - Krackery bisquity and caramel malt back bone. Has a small amount of floral hop character and the bitterness comes from the piney hop bittering. Balance is perfect throughout the entire sip. The caramel fades and leaves the mouth with a grapefruit and pine bitterness.  M - Finishes semi-dry, a little prickly and grainy on the tongue, and medium body.  D - Very high.

345,1005,Sweasty,3.78,"Hopdevil pours a nice dark copper color. Things are topped off by a finger or so of light khaki head. The head settles to a ¼ ring. Head leaves plenty of sticky lace in its wake.  Onto the aroma. Lightly pungent grapefruit hits the nose first. A bit of herbal mint backs things up. Juicy orange notes are present as well. A touch of sweet caramel and very light baked bread notes make an appearance. An overall fruitiness is present as well. Some stone fruit notes,mainly peaches, as well as a hint of apple/pear round out the nose.  The hops are bit more dominate on the palate. Grapefruit notes are more pungent. Stronger mint notes have a drying quality. Some orange peel notes round out the hops. More peach notes show up near the finish. Some light apple notes are present as well. The finish is lightly drying, with a lingering herbal bitterness.  Hopdevil sits near the lightish end of medium bodied. The carbonation is effervescent.  Hopdevil doesn't wreck the palate with aggressive hops like a typical American IPA. Its a more balanced take on things. If you are hoping for a hop bomb, this ain't it.

A bit of Co2 can be seen through the haze, left some spotted lacing here & there.  S - Floral & dry with a some pine like hops, a bit of orange peel but not big though, as I picked up a very nice malty aroma underneath. I get toasted malt notes, slight honey and even a bit of candied like qualities.  T - Right upfront I would say I get candied like qualities, not syrupy or overly sweet though, immediately following is orange peel, and a bit of caramel. Finishing flavors would have to be a slight citrus hop that cuts through the hardy malt backbone, pine, grapefruit flavors & a rind like note. Bitterness is more noticeable as the lingering finale of the taste, kinda burnt like, pretty balanced IPA.  M - Smooth and slightly oily with a very soft Co2 bite, and it's around medium-full.  D - Pretty drinkable and balanced IPA, I think the pronounced malty profile of the beer would get to me after 2-3 pints, so for me I might be able to put down 3 pints at most. I really like this one though, and I think I'd buy again. Cheers!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,JosiahS,4,"Poured this beer from a bottle into a tulip glass. It has a brown-amber color and is pretty cloudy. It gave off a great 2-finger tan head that looked to stick around a while.  At first smell, i get dark bread, burnt biscuit, brown sugar and a light sweetness that reminds me of lavender. Hops are a lot softer for the style, light pine, some citrus and grassy/earthyness.  Taste is in-line with the smell. Very bready with some malt sweetness. The earthy hops seem to blend well with the complex flavors of the malt though. The flavor is consistent from front to end, heavy on the malt with earthy/grassy hops following. Slightly citric with a dark fruit poking through, maybe grape, subtle though. Finishes with a little bitterness and lingers on the back and sides of the tongue.  mouthfeel is medium at the least with medium carbonation which fits the beer well. Soft and smooth but enough CO2 ti fizzle slightly on the tongue.  An interesting IPA, not my favorite but very nice at the least.

M - Has a bit more body than your average American IPA, but it is nice and not over the top or too heavy.  D - This is not an IPA that should really be an IIPA, there are hops but they are not over the top and there is a lot of malt to balance it all out.

Taste is butterscotch sweetness up front, followed by a ripe fruit middle, and a citrusy hop finish. Impressive bitterness levels, especially considering the rich malt flavor. The beginning fruit flavors of this ale remind me a lot of an English one. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth, low carbonation. Good Drinkability.

Nice carbonation rising through the orange amber colored body.  Smell is mainly citrus, some hints of spices as well but it doesn't really lend much on the aroma hopping side. Pretty sweet, potentially great malt backbone in this brew, the sweetness almost reminds me of a scone, bready and not too overpowering.  Flavor is great, super hop forward there is so much mixing around in my mouth it's definitely a party. Definitely picked up the orange citrus, I get some woody hop flavors as well which give it some nice bitterness, mainly pine (douglas fir for sure). I got a brief blast of sweeter pineapple, the tropical fruits are there as well as citrus for sure. Balanced spicing is present as well, definitely nutmeg, mace, a tiny amount of fresh herbs of the pungent variety mixed with some refreshing mint. The aftertaste is straight bitterness that grows the longer you wait between sips, sticks with you and I love it.  Although the flavoring defines this brew it wouldn't work without all the malt backbone they threw in here to back up their massive hoptastic concoction. This imparts a nice thick bready mouthfeel to the beer, like a multigrain toasted dinner roll. Gives you something to bite into while you mull over all the different flavors that slap you around.  Definitely drinkable, one of the first things I noticed was the refreshing feeling I got after cracking a cold one. To be fair I had a long day but seriously, it's refreshing and begs you to take on the devil",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,DAllspaw,4.2,"pours a deep amber with solid off-white head that you can float a quarter on. Great color to this beer. Good lacing after head diminishes.  Aroma is more piny, grassy than citrus. Solid, not overwhelming.  Taste is mostly malt at first, but hops quickly kick in with very nice bitter/tannin finish you'd expect from good IPA. Really good beer, will certainly buy again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,alli4051,3.83,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint.  Had a real hard time coming up with a review for this one. I really liked this beer, but I'm not sure I liked it as an IPA. Pours a deep copper color with a white head that leaves little lacing. Scent was appealing, but primarily malt, not picking up any hops really here. Taste was kind of sneaky hoppy. Lots of malty sweetness up front with some residual bitterness. There was enough hop bitterness but not a whole lot of hop flavor, which I found disappointing. Since I am drinking this in Colorado I'm sure its not as fresh as it could be; however, it was consumed by the July drink by date on the bottle. Maybe I'm biased by all the west coast hop bombs here, I don't know. Was definitely a very drinkable brew, will most likely be drinking this one again even if it isn't my ideal IPA.  Edit: Got the chance to try this again on tap while in the Philadelphia airport. I have to say having it fresher was definitely better. Most of my review stands but this second tasting had a little more of that hop flavor I was looking for and deserved a bit of a bump up in the taste department.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,greenbean3,1.83,Used to love this beer while living in PA. Don't understand what happened to this beer. Apperance: great. An aluring dark amber color. Smell is also good.

What went wrong?,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,dasenebler,3.88,"Surprised I haven't reviewed the HopDevil. I've had it several times, both out of the bottle and on-tap.  Pours a clear, medium amber hue with a nice creamy head. Good lacing and decent retention. Aroma is of sharp, piney hops and full of earthiness.  Flavor is definitely on the maltier side of the IPA spectrum. Full bodied with a toasty-caramel malt character. Typical PA/east coast, really. Don't get me wrong: the hops are there, and this is definitely more of an IPA than an amber. The hop flavor is big and bitter, with tons of pine and just a hint of citrus. But then again, HopDevil is not dry or ""west-coast."" This beer succeeds in combining a smooth, lager-like malt base with bold American hops to create a very drinkable and satisfying hoppy beer.  A sturdy, malty IPA. Good, but probably better on-tap for hop freshness.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,mjaskula,3.04,"Served in a pint glass. the beer is a clear amber with a thin off white head that thins to a film and leaves a bit of lacing.  Aroma out of the bottle is thick and floral and a bit citrusy. But that quickly fades. The remaining aroma is thinly hoppy and slightly vegetative. The flavor is fairly one dimensional, only piney hop bitterness stands out. The small malt backbone is bready and muted.  Carbonation is fine but the bitterness lingers in the mouth unpleasantly long. This isn't my kind of IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,mullenite,3.39,"Pours a nice red color with a two and a half finger white head. Lots of sticky lacing. Would probably have gotten a 5 for appearance if the head had lasted just a little longer. Still a very nice looking and very clear beer.  Smell has a slight American hop aroma with some citrus. There is also a distinct malt aroma that provides some sweetness as well as some honey in there.  A little heavy on the malt and a little sweeter than I usually like. There are no definable hop characteristics outside of the lingering bitterness on the back of my tongue. The malt flavor is nutty and a little grainy. Not bad, but not what I would normally want from an IPA either.  Medium bodied beer with perfect carbonation. A little residual sweetness hurts this but it's really a nice feeling beer.  Now that I know what I am getting in to I would probably get this again but not when I want a hop bomb. It's strange because I really enjoyed Hop Wallop and would drink that regularly but this one is just meh.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,blackc5,4.06,"Poured from a 12oz bottle at 49F into a tulip. Oh, and hey, review #100.  A - An aggressive pour netted a substantial, 2+ finger head that stood tall for quite some time. Nice billowy look, and good lacing to boot.  S - Fairly sweet and quite malty, with a large dose of caramel. The hops are there too, but actually, surprisingly given the name, hide a bit in the background.  T - I have to admit, again given the name, I was expecting an all out hop bomb. Instead, I got a very well balanced east coast IPA that is quite malty. Lots of caramel and a bit of biscuit.  I do appreciate a good east coaster as much as the hoppier west coasters, and maybe this does qualify as a 'HopDevil' out east, but surely not here. That said, it is still quite tasty and this has a fair amount of complexity. The hops themselves are mainly herbal and piney - not so much on the citrus.  M - Quite rich and full. A substantial texture on the tongue, and well (moderately) carbonated. Well done for a balanced IPA.  D - Quite drinkable. Pleasant aftertastes, and it goes down easy enough. I bought this as a single, but could see buying a sixer. Wish it was a bit hoppier yet, but I still enjoyed.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,rdub,4.2,From a fresh Victory sampler case. Had this awhile back before I knew what I was doing. This time I knew the caramel color and one finger white head with a bit of lacing was a thing of beauty. Piney grapefruity hops up front with a tiny bit of alcohol and malt in the back of the scent. Taste was delicious with a surprisingly nice malt presence despite the heavy hops. Mouthfeel and drinkability were right there for the style. This is a good gateway into the wide world of hops. Not a west coast hop bomb but still quite enjoyable.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Not to sweet though, not butterscotchy at all. The mouth feel is good. Just enough carb to cut the sweetness down a bit. The hop profile is medium, it isn't in your face but it isn't mild by any means. Backed up by a solid malt backbone. With a nice bitter after taste that lets you know this is an IPA.  I would call this a session IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Minimal head.  Taste- Prominent hop flavor. Definitely well balancedl with whatever malt is used.  Drinkability- Very quaffable. It manages to be almost light and refreshing despite it's 6.7 ABV.

There was an ample two fingers of fine whitish colored foam for a head which also left nice lacing on the walls of my pint glass.  The aroma was of sweet fr;uit, bubble gum and pine.  The flavor was a beautiful balance of bitter hops and sweet malt with background notes of grapefruit and orange blossom.  The mouthfeel was rich and full on my palate but not overbearing.

345,1005,KickInTheChalice,4.24,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Pours an amber copper color with what is initially a 3 cm. frothy off-white head. After a few moments, it drops to a thin film. A modest amount of sticky lace forms on the side of the glass.  Smell: Strong grapefruit hops provide the primary aroma. Bready malt and spicy notes in the background.  Taste: Very hoppy from the start. A tasty blend of citrus hops with a softer caramel sweetness behind it. Grapefruit, orange peel, with some unplaced spiciness as well. Hoppy, but relatively well balanced.  Mouthfeel: Fairly creamy feel for an IPA, with a great smoothness. Bubbly carbonation raises the hop oil off the tongue a bit, suspending the flavors in my mouth.  Drinkability: Tough to complain with a few of these in front of me. Smooth, classic taste.

345,1005,Echosolace,3.84,"A: Carmel-colored in appearance. Effervescent but not overly so. I'd think a shitty beer would bubble up too fast and lose its carbonation. Head is sustained for a decent amount of time. Lacing strong even in just the head.  S: Light and hoppy, but I think maybe my glass smells a bit wierd. Its been in my fridge for a while.  T: It would be a nice beer to pair with some kind of food. Some pasta or salad I think. It doesn't have the bite I like in a strong IPA, but solid nonetheless.  M: Balanced. Doesn't really blow up in your mouth like champagne, but keeps its bubbly for a while and is fun to strain over the tongue. I like this about it quite a bit. I think it's the strongest point about this beer.  D: Yeah, it's really good. It's a fine beer and I wouldn't mind making it a staple of my fridge if I wasn't so into variety. I'd think of it as a good average or median of what an IPA should be for the beer uninitiated. I actually had a person drink this along with Victory's Golden Monkey to see where they stood on the malt/hops scale. Turns out he didn't like either, but I think this was actually a good way to find out. Yumm yumm",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

One of the best balanced American IPAs I've had. They don't try too hard on the hop bitterness, but it is subtle and lasting, mingling well with the malt back that is present but I wouldn't call sweet. With a subtle hop bitterness and aroma, it seems like they really punched it up on the flavor hops.  M - Nice medium body and soft carbonation.  D - Very refreshing. I had to pace myself because it was going down so easily.  Thank God there's an American IPA out there that doesn't feel the need to kill you with bittering hops. Not that it's bad, it's just a nice change of pace. Very, very flavorful.

T- not nearly as flavorful as other IPAs I've had...but it grows on you pretty decently. Citric hops with a bite of pine near the end. It tastes like an IPA should, albeit it a lot more mild.  M- its not too heavy like some IPAs can be. Just the right amount of body...doesn't feel like you're drinking a cold glass of water, but doesn't have that thickness you're liable to get from a heavier IPA  D- pretty drinkable.

T: Taste is an amalgamation of sweet and bitter hops that are somewhat spicy and herbal and open up into lemon rind, and a nice bready malt backbone. There is a mild soapiness component to the otherwise perfect finish.  MF: Average mouthfeel with kind of a long finish.  D: A very refreshing beer, but I must say that I think it is overrated. To that end I think that this is a very good beer and a good IPA, but it doesn't exhibit the particular qualities that I look for in an award-winning IPA.

345,1005,Pahn,3.65,"12oz bottle into Duvel tulip. Best by Jun21, 2010, B4.  Appearance: Free pour yields a half inch, frothy, off-white head that dissipates quickly, leaving (like the beer itself) no lacing. Pours translucent amber.  Smell: Very weak smell of possibly grassy hops and some malt. As the beer warms, a small amount of fruity sweetness comes out, but I still need to try hard to smell the beer.  Taste: First sip: overall impression is that this is a very bready IPA, with tons of bitterness and not much hop flavor. The giant malt backbone and over the top bitterness are the dominant notes throughout. The flavor is inadequately hoppy (it's *almost* grassy and *maybe* piny), and boring... but not unpleasant. As liquid bread that's more bitter than most DIPAs, it works. I've had far worse tasting IPAs.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and rather carbonated. The crazy bitterness and carbonation make the feel quite substantial.  Drinkability: While unremarkable, the beer is quite refreshing. I don't taste the alcohol at all, and the malt flavor is nice. I like the absurd amount of bitterness. I wonder if that's what tasting any IPA for the first time is like (I don't remember).  Like most beers I've had from Victory, this one is solid, but not the kind of beer that would win someone over to a style. Or to put it more practically, not the kind of beer I'd particularly want to buy again (I found myself mysteriously craving another HopDevil after my first last night, but I would have been even more satisfied by an outstanding (D)IPA than another HopDevil). Hopefully Wild Devil or Hop Wallop will change my mind. I have to admit that I'm morbidly curious about Hop Wallop, since the bitterness level of HopDevil was so silly (I don't know what drinking a pint of hop extract is like, but I have some suspicions now). Unfortunately, I suspect that the beer was less bitter than it was *not flavorful enough*.

Pint glass pour and I am met with a copper colored ale with a bubbly foamy head which stays throughout the session and produces a ton of lacing. The aroma is a major malt bomb. Bready, doughy almost a skunky beer smell. I wasn't really impressed with the taste. I was expecting a major hop explosion but it was not to be. Subdued hops are present with a lot of maltiness going on. There is an odd aftertaste which is present far too long.

345,1005,Thiestru,4.17,"Poured from a 12-oz. bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Deep copper with about a one-finger off-white head. Minimal lacing.  Smell: Strong hops are foremost, but a darker malt tone is also noticeable.  Taste: Easily lives up to the 'HopDevil' name, as hops are what dominate the flavor. It might have been a wise move on the part of Victory not to make this stronger alcohol-wise, because it's quite potent already because of taste alone. This beer accomplishes balance while also showcasing a specific element, something many others do not. As the bitter hops occupy most of the palate, there is yet that undercurrent of malt I mentioned when describing the scent. If one holds the liquid on the front part of the tongue, the malts are easily taste-able, revealing a very subtle sweetness; as the beer moves towards the back of the tongue, the hops assert themselves powerfully.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Actually, I don't really know what to say about this part, because the flavor is so distracting. (No, that's not a problem.)  Drinkability: I seem to recall drinking these in succession; right now, I only have this one, so I can't see how many I can drink. But I would drink more than one a night, yes.

Probably the best aspect of this brew IMO.  D: Not sure I could down much more than one or two of these, very heavy and malty.

345,1005,meeekyh,4.19,"Got a few of these tonight and thought it a good chance to review them. The 12 pack is a mixer and marked best by April 02, 2010. The beer seems really no worse for the wear. I choose the standard belled beer glass for the tasting and emptied the 12 oz bottle therein.  The beer is rather amber in appearance and the head is tan in color. The head is not really thick and leaves just a bit of lacing.  Smells are rather standard IPA fare, but cleaner. I like the malts and there is little roasted or burnt taste which is really off-putting in an IPA. I am pleased with the hop profile here, it is unencumbered, full and bright.  Tasting this beer is a joy. It takes me back to a time before all IPAs tasted of too many and too much hops. Here we are not overburdened by quantity but blessed by quality. The grain bill is clearly designed to accentuate the hops. I am impressed.  Mouthfeel is medium-full. More than a good pilsner but less than a good bitter, it accentuates the taste and makes for a more drinkable beer than it would otherwise be.  Drinkability is good, and better than most of the IPAs I have had but not stellar because the style is built for staying power and not drinkability.  This is a great American IPA. Stone builds one with as much integrity but few others can lay claim to such an achievement. If you find yourself in Colorado, go to Paonia and get a SEIPA, it is another great example but very hard to get.

345,1005,rapidsequence,3.78,"12 oz bottle.  Appearance: Dark orange golden color. Fairly short lived white head with some spotty lacing.  Smell: Citrus hops, caramel malt, and a grainy aroma.  Taste: Bitter grapefruit and orange peel hops are right up front and balance is attempted and failed by a caramel malt sweetness. The graininess in the aroma is tasted on the finish and is just slightly astringent-- not really much of a detractor, but noticed. Bitter finish.  Mouthfeel: Appropriate carbonation and the expected mouthfeel for this type of IPA. Slight resiny coating is left behind.  Drinkability: This is a good bitter-hoppy IPA with strong bitter citrus flavor. I could do without the husky grain flavor.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

T: While not being a total hop nut, I do enjoy the occasional walk on the wildside, and this was certainly a step in that direction, and while I prefer it on tap, it definitely kept the punch and salty, hoppy, citrus goodness.  M: Wonderful smooth, and easy drinking.  D: Absolutely, a hop heads dream, but also complex enough to draw in non-hop fans to the realm of ""hoppiness"" definitely will have again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,BigIrishman,4.27,"Appearance: Pours clear amber with a white one finger head, leaves some lace.  Smell: A subdued light citrus with a malty sweetness back. There is a bit of some clean lemon like flavor, very subtle but definitely there.  Taste: Spices come right to the forefront with a orange/mango nectar hop presence underlying. This is what a traditional american IPA should be, hoppy without 10000 ibu's and 10 pounds of fresh cascade in every glass. This beer has a slight bitter end with a nice tangyness throughout the whole sip.  Mouthfeel: Sticky but crisp and wipes clean quickly, that tangyness defeats the bitterness so the mouth is left relatively dry between sips.  Drinkability: Great beer that keeps it's IPAness in check and allows this beer to be a sit back and relax type beer rather than an enamel ripper. Very nice and excellently balanced brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Leaves a patchy white lace on the walls of the glass.  Smell is rather subdued, mostly a grapefruit hop presence. Really not too much going on.  Taste really lets the hops come through, mostly citrus but also a bit grassy and flowery. Slight hints of the malt come through, somewhat toasted and caramel flavors.

T - Fantastic and even better than it smells. SO hoppy! Sweet cirtrusy orange with some rind in there and pine on the afterbite that finishes as crisp as you've ever had.  M - Medium bodied and pretty carbonated. The hops hammer the tastebuds after a short while.  D - What a brew. One of the brews that I turn to when I'm in the store and can't decide what to get.

Has a very strong spicy pine aroma with a little sweet bready caramel backing it up.  A complex mix of spicy pepperiness, piney hops with a little orange peel and lemon mixed in. There's some light malty caramel and toasted bread in the background and a hint of honey. The hops are most prominent, but not overwhelming - a very nice bitterness.  Medium body with prickly, but not sharp, carbonation. Only moderately dry but it lingers for a little while.  A very nice IPA - bitter for sure, but not harsh.

345,1005,cooncat,4.06,"Live review after pouring a bottle right from the fridge into my SA glass. I was looking at all my reviews, and noticed I'd never reviewed this beer, which I've been drinking for over ten years ... how could I be so remiss?  I had to moderate my pour in order to fit the entire bottle into my SA glass. This produced a nice orange-copper ale, with 2 fingers of stiff foamy head the color of orange rind. Very nice looking, and some nice lacing develops.  The nose is a little weak, but perhaps its because this isn't a really fresh bottle (label shows it to be a month past ""Best by"" date). Citrus hops come to the fore of the nose, but caramel malt is well supported as well.  The taste is hop dominant as one would expect for an IPA. Mostly grapefruit, but perhaps some orange rind as well on the palate. Caramel maltiness makes a respectable bid at balancing, but is constantly pushed back by the hops. Slightly dry but no where even close to astringent. Mouthfeel is medium and carbonation is spritely enough to make this very refreshing. The carbonation also adds a little bite to the hops. I'd rate this as a very drinkable IPA, as its very balanced. It might be a tad high in ABV to be a true 'session brew', but I know I've had several of these in an evening session without ill effect.  I've always considered Victory to be one of the nation's premier brewers, mostly due to their consistently good beers and adherence to style guidelines. Hop Devil is a fine example of an American IPA. I will drink/buy this any time I get a chance. Definitely in my 'top ten' American IPAs, and worthy of a hearty recommendation.

345,1005,sophisticated,4.25,"Poured into a perfect pint glass. Slightly hazy dark-ish amber with lovely thick (2 fingers) of sturdy, rocky, foamy head. Good retention and small bits of lace.  Upon opening the hoppy scent pours out. Citrus, mostly and some pines. Actually after pouring it the smell seems to minimize and there is something a bit off-putting about the odor.  The taste packs a punch though. A bit of sweet citrus, lemon, but strongly bitter piney hops. But then there is this caramel-malt goodness to keep it fairly balanced (while still being a strongly hoppy IPA). The alcohol is not noticeable in the taste.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability - medium to thick-ish, soft. This is a nice, refreshing IPA! I could have several of these, and with 6.7% alcohol, that would not be too bad of a thing.

The foamy head is nice and tall and white with a twinge of brown.  I thought the nose on this would be a lot more hoppy so my expectations have kind of ruined my first impressions of the smell.  Taste is nice, mostly bitter, with a definite bitter finish. Seems like it was almost a little heavy on the bittering hops and not as much for flavor and aroma.  Not as balanced as I might have thought, the malt doesnt come though that much but you know its there.  A great beer for its price point.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Withers into a thin, half-moon head very quickly.  S: grassy, earthy, mild, maybe some bitter citrus, like grapefruit under there.  T&M: strange, it starts out with a what lasts of a millisecond of spicy and floral hops, then goes instantly crisp-bitter and pine. Hops are spicy and forward yet resist yielding...and eventually blast out into a light, balanced bitter. Medium carbonation. Not cloying, yet lasting bitter semi-dry finish. nice.

There is some hop presence in the nose, but not as much as I expected. I can also smell some graham cracker malt sweetness. It has a very bitter flavor. It hits your tongue bitter, swallows bitter and lingers bitter. In addition, there is also a grassy hop characteristic to the taste. Not too much sweetness. Nor is there much mouth coating. It has a medium body and average levels of carbonation. It is very drinkable. There's lots of bittnerness, but it never gets to be too bitter.

The aroma has a little more malt characteristics than most of the IPAs I drink. There is crisp hop presence in the smell as well. This is one of the better balanced IPAs I have tasted. There is a strong hop presence all around, but the slight sweet malt component balances this extremely well.

345,1005,sk8man121,4.6,"12 oz bottle poured into Shipyard pint glass.  A: Pours a thin copper with a tan head that dissipates soon after it forms and forms the typical IPA ""oil slick."" Tiny bubbles of carbonation float to the top consistently for almost ten minutes; very cool. Completely opaque when held up to the light.  S: Smells super spicy (heat-wise, not cinnamon/clove spicy), with yeast and alcohol notes in the background. There is also a hint of grapefruit/bitter citrus that comes through at the end.  T: So beautiful and well-balanced. Drinks somewhat hot but it works so well, which is fairly rare for a beer of this ABV. More spice, hop resin and a slight malty sweetness. Finish is nice and dry and makes me want another sip immediately.  M: Very carbonated, which I believe is why the spiciness works. The carbonation turns this fairly thin brew into pure creaminess once it hits the tongue. Coats the mouth and leaves a resiny hop texture behind.  D: I can't say enough about this beer; it reminds me of synchronized swimming. Everything melds together perfectly, creating one of the more drinkable IPAs I've ever tasted.

345,1005,Jeffo,3.33,"Moms and pops brought this one back from Pennsylvania for me. Thanks guys.  From a bottle into a snifter.  APPEARANCE: Pours a big medium-thin looking 3 finger off-white head or cream colored head with half decent retention. Medium carbonation evident in the form of tiny little bubbles. Burgundy or maroon brown in color. Head recedes to a bubbly foam ring and a wisp, leaving some immediate bubbly lacing. A splotchy wisp remains leaving some lacing down the glass.  SMELL: Pale and caramel malts and mild floral notes. Hops were very subdued here. Not all that much to talk about. Not bad, just not interesting enough for the style.  TASTE: Much better; where did this come from? Pale and caramel malts up front with some floral hops through the middle. Finishes with a good dose of piney floral and bitter hops. A bold and lingering aftertaste is full of piney flavors and a touch of caramel sweetness to balance it out. Good stuff here.  PALATE: Medium-light body with higher end carbonation. Not creamy enough, but goes down fine and finishes slightly dry on the palate. Just doesn't quite measure up.  OVERALL: Definitely an odd one. The taste profile was well balanced and very enjoyable, making it more than drinkable, but the nose was too weak and everything else about it was average at best. I'm honestly not quite sure why this one is rated so highly. Perhaps the bottle was not quite as fresh as it could be, so I'll have to give it another go if I see it on my next trip to the States.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

I don't see Victory very often out here on the west coast but I'll have to start seeking them out.  Tasting Notes: I generally think appearance is overrated but this is a beautiful beer. The reddish copper hue seems to glow from within. If there's a weakness it's the nose (also overrated, especially on Beeradvocate...smell gets 20% but drinkability gets 10%!?!?) which is almost off-putting. The taste is sublime.

345,1005,RevereBeer,4.23,"Poured a light copper red out of a 12oz bottle, thick light cream head that dissipated quickly. Papery lace and even carbonation.  Spicy hops dominate the nose, but there's definitely sweeter malt hiding in there. Nothing too powerful, but well suited for the style.  True to the aroma, hops are very intense throughout. Spicy, citrus, and drying. Maltiness is totally blown away by the hops, but its there without a doubt, especially as my taste buds adjust to the hop acids.  Mouthfeel is nice - fullbodied and sticky at the same time. Pretty high carbonation, but feels right for an IPA.  Drinkability is very high, despite the bitterness.

345,1005,SpeedwayJim,4.11,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle with a best buy date of June 21, 2010, into a Surly pint glass.  A: Standard pour yields a 1 finger semi-coarse white head with decent retention. Beer is a crystal clear orange, bordering on the darker side for an IPA. Lacing's got great stick but is rather spotty.  S: Faint citrus and an awkward rubbery hoppiness. Also faintly creamy and nutty. Nose isn't outstanding with this one and there isn't a clear aroma that stands out. In fact, I really have to breathe deep and use my imagination for this one.  T: Citrus hops are pronounced in the opening. Piney and well balanced with a subtle malt backbone. Flavors become deeper and deeper as it warms in the mouth, to the point of almost a hoppy brown ale. Nuttiness is apparent towards the end. Finish is quick, accented by a burst of hop flavor that quickly fades into nothing.  M: Light bodied, moderatly carbonated, and very smooth for an IPA. Watery in the mouth with an appreciably clean finish that leaves little on the palate.  D: Highly dirnkable, this is one of the best Victory offerings that I've had to date. Well balanced and not overhopped with a surprisingly smooth mouthfeel. Finish is exceptionally clean and keeps me going back for more. This is one beer I look forward to revisiting in the future.

Years ago when I first tried it, it really stood out, it's been awhile since then so maybe my tastes have changed.

HopDevil certainly has hops, lots of them, big piney resinous and citric hops, citrus isn't as prominent but it is present with candied grapefruit and a touch of orange.

345,1005,BBThunderbolt,3.83,"Served in straight pint glass. Poured a clean, clear copper color with a head that was just off-white and had good retention and lacing.  The aroma was nicely balanced between the hops and malt, with traces of pine, citrus and floral notes all apparent. The flavor was very similar and had many of the same features, with a nice dry finish.  The body was very good, smooth and nicely coating without being overly sticky. Drinkability was also very good, for a hoppy beer it goes down smoothly and having several is a joy.  Overall, a very good example of the style that is certainly worth your time.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

T: more caramel sweetness upfront followed by orange juice and orange peel, with some grassiness. followed by a sharp hoppy bitterness, lemon, caramel, and pine sap.  M: full-medium body with a good carbonation. finishes resinous and dry.  Overall, i love the use of the german two row malt in this one. It's like drinking the love child of an oktoberfest and an AIPA.

345,1005,zoso1967,4.3,"Pours a lovely copper that fades to golden around the edges. Carbonation is subdued, not much head and what is there is fading disappointingly fast. The beer does have pretty good lacing though. The aroma is malty for an American IPA, which is to say, while there is plenty of citrus and pine aroma, there is also decent amount caramel malt in the nose as well as a touch of spice. Taste is quite different from a lot of other IPAs and very nice. Well balanced with a nice hop flavor. White grapefruit and pine mingle well with the substantial malt backbone that consists of some caramel, some biscuit and a bit of spice. Yum! Firm bitterness lends to a nice finish in this IPA which I would describe to be on the lighter side of medium. Definitely drinkable and a session beer for a hop head like me. This and Two Hearted are what got me into IPAs and I had forgotten what a great beer this is.

A true hop bomb, with a bit of honey like sweetness to go along and finishes off crisp and bitter.  Very nice carbonation level and very smooth.  Goes down nice and easy...for a hop-head.

Piny hop flavor with a malty citrus cut; possibly made with honey?  M- Very Good body, medium carbonation. Smooth yet bitter finish.

I was expecting more of a maltier brew due to the aroma, and there is definitely a toasted malt flavor however the spicy hops dominate. Balanced? Not exactly. Do I care, no, because I like hop forward IPA's. So, tastes great!  M - Medium bodied with good carbonation.

Nose is pretty subtle with sweet hints of citrus fruits including grapefruit and a hoppy finish rounds her out. Palate has some caramel and malts in it along with the piny IPA and hoppy finish. A mediocre tasting IPA at best. Mouthfeel is fairly thin with solid carbonation. Drinkability is mostly due to the style as this one does not shine compared to others.

Beautiful looking beer.  Smell: Grassy and mild citrus hops, with a fairly noticeable sweet and bready malt backbone. Hops were not as prevalent as I expected, nor as harsh.  Taste: Surprisingly balanced. The grassy and mild citrus hops are up front, but their bitterness is cut by the malt. There's a mild bitterness in the finish, but nothing major. I'm missing the usual hop 'bite' that I usually get in IPAs. When I first tried this, I thought immediately of SNPA - which is not necessarily a bad thing, but to me, this is more of an American Pale Ale than an IPA. It's an enjoyable beer, but IMO, not the best IPA. The overall flavor is a little watery.  Mouthfeel: Thin, but good carbonation.  Drinkability: It's a good beer, and one I wouldn't mine having several of...if the ABV was lower. It doesn't taste like an IPA, just a regular APA, but has the ABV of an IPA. It's not a bad beer...but not what I would go for if I want an IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

T: Taste is much like it smells. Sweet malt and a bit of honey with some piney hops. I perfer a more citrus character to IPAs, but this is a nice balance.

345,1005,Patrick999,3.91,"Rare midweek review for me, but I was in the mood for a good IPA. Picked up a single at Whole Foods and here I am. 12 oz bottle, ""enjoy by Mar 20 2010"" on the bottle.  As seems to be typical of Victory beers, this is an attractive pour into my imperial pint glass - reddish gold color, very good foam retention with a little lace.  Has an aroma of funnel cake and Pine-Sol.  Very astringent soapy/piney hops here. Thick malt backbone lets you know this is an East Coast IPA, but it's an aggressive East-coaster. I prefer more citrus/tropical fruit hop character in IPAs over the soapy-piney thing, but a personal preference aside, this is a strong effort.  Has a moderately oily feel, goes down easily.

This is a delicious sweet hop nectar with a caramel malt sweetness. Just absolutly amazing. Well maybe not AMAZING! but really an awesome tasting hoppy caramel candy. I see this beer all the time, but Ive never picked it up until now. Glad I did and I will grab this next time Im having hop withdrawls.  Smooth creamy mouthfeel, with a nice lasting hop bite.

345,1005,BostonTriggs,4.52,"First time reviewing in a bar. Not sure how this will go.  Poured from 12oz bottle to pint glass. Let it breathe a bit.  A - Seems to be a light brown/amber color, but appears to be a hazy light golden color when lighted. Starts w/ dense light-peach colored head, and this slowly fades to nothingness.  S - Dominated by floral hops and ruby grapefruit. Very appealing to me. I think I get a pale malt, and the slightest bit of caramel. A slight wheat bread smell, that my mind interpreted as papery at first (not in a skunked way, a positive way). I might be imagining this, but I also smell lemon.  T - Few words needed here. Floral hops, grapefruit, and a beautiful bitterness. It's so perfectly balanced that I have no words to describe it. It starts w/ grapefruit, then adds floral hops, then finishes w/ a nice bitterness. All three flavors hold together at the end. The crispness and individuality of each taste is what blows my mind.  M - Medium body. A little slickness. Coats the mouth well. Medium carbonation. It just chills in your mouth. It's not a trouble maker.  D - Downs easy if you like hops. If you don't, skip this one. I could drink a few of these before I would want to switch. Not a session beer for everyone.  This is among my favorites.

Pours into pint glass to form beautiful fine-bubbled foam that crashes fast but leaves lace.  Not as hazy as you'd expect from such a hoppy brew; wonder if they filter it?  Smell every kind of hop you could imagine, as well as mighty fierce ethanol. You might wonder if hops could possibly smell any better. I grow them in backyard garden; IPA like this is where hops belong.  Taste could maybe use a bit darker malt roast, as hops are so potent it's hard to taste anything else. But I really love it anyway.  Mouthfeel is greasy with hop resins, yay! Hop bitter aftertaste and really volatile floral hopblossom back up your nose when you hang onto your glass wondering if you want another swallow yet makes this a have your ale and swallow it too sort of gift to mankind.  Drinkability is limited by what feels like more alcohol than the supposed 6.7%. Maybe the huge hoppiness makes you imagine this brew will get you drunk too fast?

345,1005,Sam21,4.5,"A - 12 oz bottle poured into nonic pint glass. The beer has a hazy copper color with a thick off-white head that clings viciously to the glass as it recedes to a nice layer of suds sitting on top of the beer. As the beer goes down it continues to cling to the glass.  S - Piney grapefruit hop smells dominate the nose with sweet malt mixed in, although the hops are the most prominent smell.  T - Citrus hops dominate this beer entirely. There is malt sweetness mixed in there somewhere, but the hop flavors overpower... in a good way. The hops linger on the taste bud long after the beer is gone. In that sense it's not entirely balanced, but is instead a tasty hop bomb.  M - Creamy smooth across the tongue with tingly carbonation.  D- Highly palatable IPA as I'm someone who loves heavy citrusy hoppy beers. Very refreshing, but the ABV keeps this from being highly sessionable.  Overall - I can't find one thing that I do not like about this beer. It tastes very similar to the Stone IPA and Smuttynose ""Finest Kind"" IPA and is definitely now, along with those two, one of my favorite American IPAs. Unbalanced when considering the style, but personally I love the dominant flavors.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Apples, pineapple, and mango on the sweet, inviting nose. On the tongue the tropical fruit just explodes! Tons of guava upfront, followed by mango, papaya and eventually ruby-red grapefruit as the HopDevil works his finishing magic and reminds you that he indeed hails from the earth of Pennslyvania. With quite a pleasant pucker the tropical attack finishes dry and earthy and the Hop Devil goes down smooth. Hell of a delightful, persistant finish, as the hops and fruits play around the mouth for minutes after sips! Maybe too highly sessionable.

345,1005,adamette,3.83,"Live review. Poured from the 12 oz. bottle that I bought as a single at Save-On Tobacco & Beverage in Mentor, Ohio a few weeks ago for $1.49 into my Cooperstown Beverage Trail pint glass. No ""best by"" date observed by me.  A Great looking very light brown creamy head that stayed around for 5 minutes or more and leaves significant lacing on the inside of the glass. Body is a nice medium caramel with plenty of carbonation rising up and some interesting sediment floating about as well. Very good look. 4.5  S Floral hops abound. I am not great at identifying the different kinds of hops but I do believe that I smell many types of hops, some bitter, some earthy and even a sweetness buried deeply behind the hops. Complex, interesting. 4.0  T A huge, complex taste of both grapefruit bitter but also earthy, leafy hops over a reasonably good malt background make for a good tasting beer. The qualities of this beer changes as it warms so I would encourage anyone reading this to allow it to warm a bit and compare the taste with a cold version. 4.0  M As far the feel, again this is a huge beer with a ""rough"" kind of feel with the tart, sometimes ""harsh"" hops, big medium roast malt and elevated ABV. 4.0  D Not real good for me because of the bigness of the beer, the ABV. I did not have a problem finishing the 12 ounces though. 3.0  Notes: Hop lovers should certainly seek this one out.

S - Smells of strong citrus hops, as it should.  T - Taste is surprising, simply because it's not as bitter as expected. The citrusy hops are in full force, but there's a strong malt backbone to really smooth it out. A hoppy beer to be sure, but tastes very well balanced.  M - Smooth. Real smooth.  D - Excellent. Great, bold flavor plus a smooth mouthfeel makes me want another before I'm even done with the first one.

A good dose of earthy hops come through in a fairly bitter finish. Pretty good balance is achieved between the bitter and sweet flavors here, leading to a tasty, crisp, and refreshing quaff.  D: A nice drinking IPA with a reasonably low abv., making it good for a short session or for drinking with wings. Just don't have too many - 6.7% will catch up to you pretty quick!

Appearance: Reddish - Copper Beer is topped by about 2 inches of white frothy foam. It laces the glass nicely as it recedes. Looks beautiful.  Smell: Spicy, floral hop smell.

Definitely a 'spicy' IPA. The mouthfeel is great and creamy on-tap. (I've had it on-tap a couple times since and it's been pretty thin with low carbonation, eh.) Hops would kill this over time but this IPA still holds up great in my book. 9 or 10 bucks for the 6-pack is a good price too.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,speter,3.65,"12-ounce bottle into imperial pint glass.  A: Pours a clear, rich amber color with 3 fingers of head that leaves nice lacing.  S: One word: hops. Citrus, rather than pine.  T: Hops, start to finish. While this is of course what one would expect from a beer called HopDevil, I thought the balance wasn't what it should have been. I got just a hint of malt in the center, and I'd have liked a bit more. The bracing bitterness up front was good, and the hoppy finish is good, but more complexity is needed.  M: The body is just right, as is the carbonation.  D: It's drinkable if you want hops, hops, and more hops. I'd have no problem knocking back a couple of these.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,JustinJTisdale,4.47,Grabbed a six pack of this because I remembered loving it when it was on tap.  The color is gold with off white head that lasted very long considering the style and left a nice thin lacing.  The taste is VERRRY hoppy and citrusy and the smell of hops flooded the living room to the point where my girlfriend a few feet away commented on the smell asking if they sold candles with that aroma.  I plan on grabbing another 6 pack of this as soon as its gone!,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Foxtrot,4.35,"After thoroughly enjoying Yakima Twilight, it was only logical to try their IPA as well.  Amber and dark gold colors are very prominent, accompanied by a very nice ivory colored cap. Lacing and retention where both outstanding in every respect. Long retention and huge sticky lacing.  Aroma is a big on the hops. Pine, citrus, and sweetness of caramel lend it to have a very big and pungent nose worthy of any hophead to behold.  As I said before, this beer is to be enjoyed by any self proclaimed hophead. Pine and citrus are very prominent along with a abundance of caramel sweetness. The malts are just as bit as strong as the hops. A big beer with a multitude of flavors.  Mouthfeel is a solid medium. Perfect for the style, and perfect for Hopdevil.  Drinkability is sturdy. A few of these could go down effortlessly.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,MURF0320,3.73,"Pours hazy coppeer with 2 fingers of fluffy light tan head, very little lacing. With a beer named Hopdevil I was definately expecting more hops from my first wiff. The scent was a bit weak and balanced by sweet malt. Taste is also more balanced than expected. Definitely bitter and filled with citrus and spicy hops, but there is quite a bit of malt complexity. Finishes with a blunt bitterness and peppery spice. Mouthfeel leaned toward dry and thin.

S: Nice, high-citrus aroma with the emphasis on oranges. Hops come through as well, with a bit of pine too, but the citrus wins out for sure.  T: Excellent flavor - citrus blast at the start, with a perfect hoppy finish. Moderate duration with the hops, but the bitterness is not overwhelming.  M: Light-to-medium bodied, with some creaminess and average-to-lively carbonation.  D: An excellent IPA that I could easily put back a few of, as the bitterness is extremely present but not too strong at all.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Not as hoppy as some stronger ipa's, but a really good amount. Tastes bitter yet still a little hint of sweetness. Goes down easy, and the not overly bitter taste resides in the mouth for a good while. Very drinkable, I kinda want another one.

345,1005,mklinger,3.64,"Poured into a shaker pint glass. Very substantial head, at least 3 fingers going 1/2 an inch over the top of the glass. Lovely light amber , nice clarity and pretty carbonation.  Aroma was a bit muted for an IPA. Some citrus and a bit of dank earthiness. Not my favorite combination of aroma hops. It's not highly flawed but it doesn't resonate with me.  Flavor was fairly balanced for an IPA. Nice malty richness, some toastiness in the malt with a touch of sweetness. Good bitterness follows. The Victory website says there's Tettanager hops in here and that just doesn't seem to fit view of what an IPA should taste like -- there's an earthy herbal quality here that's just as assertive to me as the more common citrus qualities & I'm just not crazy about the earthiness & herbal qualities here.  Mouthfeel and drinkability are still very good here. This is an extremely well-brewed beer. I'm just don't like the recipe as well as I thought I would. I've had 4 HopDevil's now & it's a good beer that many will like & I can see why. It's just not for me.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

M: Lots of carbonation, on the high side for the style, well attenuated, crisp D: A nice example of the style, but not a great one. Worth trying, but I am puzzled by all of the high reviews.

Malt doesnt balance out the hops on this one and for the style it should.  Mouthfeel: perfect carbonation, nice mouthfeel. Creamy midpalate.  Drinkability: Pretty good American IPA.

Stream of bubbles up the center of the glass. Two fingers of off-white head with decent retention and little lacing.  S - Faint, spicy hops.  T - Sweet, toasted malt with slight biscuit flavor. The malt is substantial but not in balance with the spicy hops that dominate. Hops are much stronger than the smell indicated and linger in the finish.  M - Decadently creamy and frothy at first.

It has a very light hop aroma.  The taste is bracingly bitter. Tea-like hop flavors mix with tastes of biscuit from the malts. The finishing hop flavor is earthy and almost smoky. Very nice.  The body is slick and glassy.  This is a fine American IPA that will appeal especially to hopheads.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Mistofminn,3.68,"I've had most of Victory's offerings but for some reason always skipped this. Finally bought a sixer and had a couple the other night.  Poured into a pint glass, this copper hued beer has a large light tan creamy head with pretty good retention. It leaves nice rings of lacing around the glass.  The nose at first is dominated by hops, but as it warms the malts come out in force and eventually take over completely. This is a malty IPA in my opinion.  Taste is definitely dominated by a heavy caramel malt backbone with spicey and citrus hops sprinkled in for texture. Pretty good tasting, but sub par compared to some of the great IPA's out there.  Mouthfeel is medium, smooth with a lingering bitter aftertaste. Drinkability is ok, the ABV is a little high for a session beer but I could easily have mutliple of these in a night.  Not a bad IPA, just not a great one. I'm not really disappointed, just sort of nuetral.

The top of the head is pretty creamy and has large bubbles where it touches the glass. Thick lacing starts to be left on my glass almost immediately. Smells of bitter, piney hops and sugary amber malts. The balance is pretty nice here and the strength is not bad for either element. I like my beer to have a strong nose, this one is rather fulfilling. The malt element is a bit too sweet to blend in very well, still a good nose though. The hops are also a bit one dimensional. The taste is strange in this beer. It is not the hoppiest beer I have had by far but the hops are incredibly bitter and piney. I also get some orange peel and citrus notes. They dont mask the malts completely but the hop profile itself isn't balanced enough. I still enjoy the beer but it is definitely performs a beat down on my taste buds. Also, they obviously meant for this to have a huge hoppiness. Mouthfeel is rather nice, the body is moderate and the carbonation is appropriate for the taste. The only thing here is the relentless bitterness attack on the tongue. No warming to speak of. This one would be hard to session for me because of the bitterness on the tongue.

It is a blend of grapefruit, grassy hops, and pale malt.  T-It starts with grassy and grapefruit hop flavors. Pale and sweet malt follow and cut out some of the initial bitterness. The grapefruit and grasy hop flavors return at the end and leave some lingering bitterness.  M-Medium bodied and creamy from the head.  D-It goes down easily enough. Not sure it is an IPA.

S- A very strong grapefruit smell, with orange zest and dark caramel malt. Very nicely balanced.  T- Just like the nose, alot of grapefruit (maybe a tad too much for my taste), orange zest from the hops, and a dark caramel taste from the malts. Bitter at first taste, then the malt evens the taste, and then again, a pretty bitter yet delicious finish and aftertaste  M- Medium body, and a pretty good amount of sharp carbonation. Dry, bitter, citrus aftertaste that stays around for a good while, especially in the back of your mouth.  D- Fresh and well balanced. This is a bitter beer with malt sweetness to balance it out. I have had several of these in the past that have had less of a grapefruit taste, so that may have just been this bottle.

Hop oil was definitely good and strong in the nose. Floral and citrus hops were backed lightly by a semisweet toasty malt backbone.  Even better is the taste.... it was as good as I was expecting. The oily hop profile was very multidimensional; grassy, floral, and citrus. Malt was weak in comparison, but was right where it should be in an IPA IMO. A nice sweetness and buttery notes help add another layer to an already complex resume.  Feel was smooth as the carbonation was just enough to add the crispness needed. The hops definitely made my cheeks pinch and pucker a little, letting me know I WAS drinking a real IPA. But it wasn't too soapy or offensive that a non-hophead would complain about their tongue melting away.

Nice retention and lacing.  A nice hop bouquet which leans more towards the balanced side for its style. Almost perfumy hop aromas of citrus, apricot and peach yet with a nice malty backbone.  Much more hop forward than I was expecting, this really is well above average for its style. Takes on a much more sticky pine character in the mouth with tropical fruits adding a welcomed layer of flavor.  Very drinkable with a superb mouthfeel.

Something weird about Victory's hoppy beers (this one and Hop Wallop). . . they seem more like English IPAs with a higher amount of hops. Rather than the usual hop character used out West, these ones seem to just load up on whatever Euro style hops (E. Kent goldings, Hallertau, Saaz) as opposed to some of the higher alpha acid hops out West.  Beer looks decent, nice amber goldness, smells like a minimal hop bouquet of some of those other hops, taste dissapates too quickly.

Strong hops smell but yet I can get the malt to, I expected the hops to just dominate.  Very nice citus notes to the hops also a floral finish. Semi sweet malts and some spices do some balanceing work to the beer, but the after taste on your tounge is very pungent straight up delicious hop juice. Not overly bitter but fantastic hoppyness to this beer.  You can feel the bitterness on the back of your tounge for a few seconds but it slowy dies down. Medium body bring me another round please!!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,drabmuh,3.78,"Had this beer on draft with dinner. Served in a pint glass. Beer is red and clear. Yellow head made up of medium bubbles, carbonation low to moderate.  Aroma is mostly malt with a mild pine hop aroma. I was expecting more hops and less malt.  Low hop bitterness witht his beer, high hop flavor, mostly pine. Medium body, drinkability moderate. Bitterness builds as you drink. There is a mild bitter aftertaste that gets progressively worse the more you drink, affects drinkability a lot. The hops slowly coat your mouth. This beer is deceptively bitter.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,polygman,3.46,"Poured from bottle into a standard pint glass. Great head and carbonation. Its color is quite amberish with a slight orange hue. Much darker than some IPAs. Smell is a bit of a let down, has the typical IPA citrus smell but its not very strong and am really not getting much from it. Taste - alright were getting there, lemon rind, sharp bitterness and spicy pepper finish. Finish is sweet and lingerers on the mouth for a long time. Not a bad IPA, pretty solid in drinkability and could see drinking a few. Really nothing spectacular though, there are certainly other IPAs that I would rather drink.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,cagocubs,4.28,"I had taken a long break from writing reviews. This beer brought me back. I was thoroughly impressed with Victory's HopDevil IPA.  A: Nice amber with shades of brown. Nice biege head with lacing around glass. S: Hops, Caramel, and Citrus- Good stuff. T: Surprisingly not as overpowering as I had imagined. With 6.7, I found this to be refreshing as the citrus prevailed. You still get the IPA hop bite in the aftertaste. M: Good carbonation, fairly light texture. D: high, I can drink this all night.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,jdskinns,3.25,"Bottle. Pours about an inch worth of creamy white head that sticks around. Transparent orange color. Smell is soapy, piney, and a little citrus hop aroma. Slightly sour taste with some pine and hop flavor. Not a bad tasting beer. Very drinkable and pretty good.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,ShadesOfGray,3.98,Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a sniffer. Very nice in appearance. Golden orange with a rather respectable size creamy white head. Aroma is very pleasant and strong. Spicy and the bitters are definately picked up imediately. Taste very true and full to the IPA brew style. Not overwelming...a pleasant mixture of bitterness and sweet malts. Better when cold with this brew.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,constahoogan,4.2,"Deep amber orange body with a hint of brown that produces an extremely light brown tan bubbly head the size of 1.5 fingers. Very attractive thick earthy lacing as the head mellows.  Dude, this ale smells totally awesome. Spicy pine-like hops that entices me to hoover one huge gulp. First, the caramel malt comes to play. The spicy pine hops are introduced mid-way and just overtake any malt presence. As the brew rises in temp, the hop spice accentuates.  This beer is pretty 'sharp' in terms of mouthfeel. That hop bite is very assertive when it comes down to crispiness. This brew is just friggin' tasty. It surely hits the spot, very refreshing.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Lambstrong,3.65,"Appearance: Nice copper color. Thick tan head. Resilliant lacing that sticks to the walls of the glass all the way down.  Aroma: Lots of citrus. Tons of Grapefruit with a little pine.  Taste: Upfront citrus notes. Bitterness follows in aftertaste. Perhaps not as balances as it should be.  Mouthfeel: Well carbonated. Hard to tell with high citrus notes. Light on tongue.  Overall, a good hoppy beer if you like extreme IPAs. However, I would have appreciated a more balanced beer. A higher gravity could have helped here.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,JerzDevl2000,4.15,"Picked this up just to review it on here! I love my IPA's and this one is certainly worthy of the style as it's pretty hoppy. Not as good as the West Coast versions of this style but it fits the bill and is sure to please any hophead!  The pour was nice - a dark amber hue, plenty of head, and a moderate amount of lacing on my glass. A good smell to it as well with the floral notes standing out. There's very little carbonation to this but the taste works out nicely regardless, with an oily resin holding the dry hopped taste and the oily resin consistency together. It's not as bold as other beers I've had in this style because the mouthfeel is a bit more balanced.  This beer doesn't taste or feel strong and I was surprised to see how strong the ABV% was. It doesn't go down that fast but it goes down pretty easily and once again, Victory has a winner here. It's only a step or two behind the leaders in this category and certainly worth a try if you're a fan of this style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,RJay,4.68,"Appearance: Slightly hazy but beautiful copper/amber color. The head was an off white color and not very thick, fizzled away into a ring that left very little lacing.  Smell: Strong hops smell, very citrusy. Smells fantastic.  Taste: Just as it smelled it has a strong hops flavor with some spice. Very well balanced.  Mouth feel: Very smooth and clear, not gritty or overly carbonated.  Drinkability: This is a terrific beer and easily sessionable. I will be adding HopDevil to my line up of favorite brews.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Intimidtor,3.95,Picked up a couple single IPAs while at the beer store. This one looked interesting and my buddy has told me about Victory beers. So I purchased for about 2 bucks a bottle and took it home. Poured into a 12 oz. snifter with little to no head. Aroma that I would expect from an IPA and nice appearance. Taste as good but mouthfeel seemed a little dry and off. I could only drink a few of these in a sitting. Should defintely try if your an IPA lover like me.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,BigMike,4,"""Menacingly delicious""  Poured from a 12oz. bottle with one of the coolest looking labels around into a tulip glass.  A blood red color with some dark orange highlights. A nice two finger tan head on top. A very nice looking beer.  Smell is hops and dark malts. The hops win out but not my much. Its pretty even as far as aroma.  With the name hopdevil, one would think this one would be a total hop bomb. Thats not the case. Hopdevil is pretty evenly balanced. Bitter hops and a spicey maltiness are the predominate flavors.  Mouthfeel is really good. Smooth and clean.  Overall i like my IPA's a lot more hoppy then malty. But Hopdevil is a real good beer. One of my early favorites when i got onto the craft beer scene.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,HURTemHIZZY,4.28,"had this on tap at a phillies-yankees world series game.  Poured a deep goldeny copper color, with a two finger white head that hung around nicely and left some solid rings of lacing around the cup.  Smells very hoppy, with some citrus coming through with the hops. Not much malt in the smell, but I'm a far bigger fan of hops anyway.  Tastes, again, very hoppy, Has some very nice citrus notes in the hops, with some grapefruit hops in the tail end of the flavors. Also can notice some maltiness in the end of the tasting that I didn't catch in the aroma. In my opinion, fantastic flavor.  Soem nice carbonation, not too horribly bubbly but also not flat or skunky. Makes me want to have more. Also has that bitter hoppy aftertaste that I love.  Overall I think that this was a great beer. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a hoppy beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,TommyW,4.25,"A- Fairly clear, gold with amber tints. Big, white, bubbly head that sticks nicely.  S- Brief hint of malt then just dominated by floral, oily hop aroma.  T- Don't really get any malts here. There is lemon/orange rind taste that starts this one off; followed by the floral hops. Leaves a strong, lingering bitterness.  M- Medium to slightly full with a smooth carbonation.  D- Pretty good IPA. The lingering bitterness is a little stronger than in most IPAs, but I don't mind that at all.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,jbertsch,3.69,"Poured this into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass. Color was a medium-to-dark copper. Head was two-finger in size and fluffy before fading to a film after a couple sips.  Aroma is definitely dominated by hops. While the hops aroma is strong, it doesn't entirely overpower. I smell some sweet malts trying to come through but they're primarily overwhelmed by the hops.  The taste is a reflection of the aroma - the hops are huge, but they taste organic and real. Semi-sweet malts help to balance off the hops on the tongue (a little bit), especially at the end so the aftertaste isn't nearly as bitter as I expected it to be.  Mouthfeel is lively and crisp but smoothes out. Your tongue feels the bitterness at first, but it doesn't last long, which makes this a pretty drinkable hop-focused beer.  I think the malts in this one make the heavy hops tolerable, therefore an enjoyable brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Looks so damn appealing!  bitter, spicey hops in the smell, spice, floral esters, spice..  Taste is perfect. Its nicely balanced with a slam of hops in the beginning.

345,1005,feelmefoam,4.37,"Poured from a 12-oz bottle into a pint glass.  Pours a hazy brownish-orange color, very pretty and a bit different from some other IPAs I've seen. A finger of head that ran away fairly quickly, not too much lacing.  Smells interesting, too. You can definitely smell some floral hops, but also a good bit of bready/caramel malts are present. Some spiciness present there as well, though faint.  I really like this. It's bitter, alright, you sure can taste the floral hops, but this is a well-balanced brew. It kicks in with some caramel/toffee malt to add a bit more in the flavor department. I'm liking this a lot.  This beer has a medium body to it with not a lot of carbonation present. It finishes easy with a little aftertaste of hops and malt, leaving you wanting more.  I really like this IPA. It's a little heavier and bitter than some others I've had in the style, but the malty aspect that comes with the intense hop character makes me want to drink more of this. It would get you eventually, though, with that 6.7% ABV. It is delicious, though.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Gyle41386,3.5,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  Orange amber pour with about two fingers of rich foam. Head retention is outstanding, and there's some quickly-falling lacing on the glass.  Aroma is a nice collection of bitter citric hops, sweet caramel malt, and a bready/grainy scent.  Well, the name HopDevil is appropriate, because the flavor profile begins and ends with bitter hops. The hop flavor is citrus peel, all the way, so it really actually tastes less like a citrus fruit, and more like that herbal piney bitterness. The bitterness is unfortunately quite harsh, and fairly unpleasant. I'm not sure what happened after that delightful nose.  Body is medium-full. Somewhat crisp, dry finish. The finger or so of foam that remains throughout aids HopDevil's creaminess.  The only previous time I had tasted this beer was a 2 oz sample at a fest, and I remembered that I didn't like it, but I had consumed enough previous samples that I couldn't remember what about it I didn't like.

Taste- Wonderful hop taste. Almost over-powering but the crisp clean finish suprised me. Made me want another sip almost instantly. Couldn't detect much malt at all, they don't call it Hop Devil for nothing.  mouthfeel- The hops can sometimes leave a prickly feeling on the palate, but once I got used to that I loved the experience.

A nice foam of head that leaves some light scattered lacing.  Smells like burnt toast, old pine trees, talcum powder. Nothing really floral or grapefruit-y here.  Taste is just intense pine tree sap, spicy herbal-ness, warm grapefruit juice. No real sweetness here, just that intense dry after taste from the hops that is really unappealing.

345,1005,blaje,3.68,"Pours copper, orange lightly brownish in colour. Probably one of the darkest IPA I've tasted so far. Beautiful off-white head, looks almost creamy!  At opening, their's an immediate nose of grapefruit and during pouring, a pungent, floral aroma of hops. Unfortunately nose remains quite unidimensional after opening.  Mouth is not very pronounced (or as pronounced as expected). Of course, citrus flavours are abundant but not overwhelming. Grapefruit, pink grapefruit to be more precise, dominates all the flavours. Zest of lemon. Lightly piny not too resinous. Good carbonation. Aftertaste is a bit tart and acid. Hops are lengthy on tongue...  Finally, expectation where high for this beer and I'd say that I'm a bit disappointed. Did I score a bit low (?), maybe! It's a good IPA, but was expecting something more opulent and complex. A bit more malt to give more structure and balance would be welcome.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,jeffthecheff,3.68,"Reviewing this beer out of the victory sample pack. The bottle didn't have any date on it, but the 12 pack said best by 12/20/09  Pours a light, reddish amber, with a slight haze. The head on a straight pour is perfectly fluffy and large.  Aroma is interesting, and not really typical of the IPA's I'm used to. It's slightly fruity, with pine, wood, and a bit of earth. While it has a good hop character, the hops used seem to be different from the West Coast ""C"" hops I'm used to in an American IPA, and if I were to guess, I'd say they aren't in this beer at all, as I'm not picking up much citrus. Moderatly strong aroma, I wish it was just a bit stronger.  Flavor has some slight, candy like sweetness along with some herbal hoppiness. The lack of a very strong hop presense in the aroma seems to lessen the hop flavor. Bitterness is there, and it's quite strong. Nice bitter character from start to finish.  Mouthfeel is surprisingly dry for an amber colored, 6.7% IPA. Drinkability is about what I'd expect for an IPA, it's not something I could sip all night but it makes for a pleasant pint.  Overall, this is a decent East coast IPA but nothing to go crazy about. I'm impressed with the different aroma, which makes it stand out from most IPAs. I just wish this was more potent in hop flavor and aroma, and maybe I'd be more impressed with a week old keg than a 2 month old bottle.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Diablerie,4.5,"Recently acquired a six-pack of this brew for an IPA/dIPA tasting night with some good friends. The other night, I more scrutinously analyzed one of the ""leftovers"".  12oz. bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance - Coppery/light-brown coloration with thin tan head. Head has very minimal retention--disappears within several minutes of pouring.  Smell - Mosaic of floral hop smells; grapefruit and lime possibly? It's always difficult for me to pick apart the scents of fruity esters.  Taste - A salvo of hops for the most part. In fact, it seems a bit unbalanced. There would be room for malt character, but I never did say it was a bad thing to have too much hop flavor. Just being critical, I suppose. Again, it's hard for me to pick apart the flavors, but I certainly catch a hint of pine and a confirmation of the grapefruit odor detected previously.  Mouthfeel - Very full. Perhaps a bit sticky and resiny. Still, it goes down easy enough.  Drinkability - A bit intense, but certainly very enjoyable. A great example of an IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,blackenmn,3.8,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass:  Appearance and Smell-Poured a good clean orange/copper color. Left a very miniscule head which went away very quickly, not much carbonation present. Smell was of malty/sweet citrus. Seemed like more of a floral than piney hop presence in there. Very tame, nothing really aggressive on the nose.  Taste and Mouthfeel-Pretty balanced. Had a very sweet almost caramel/citrus thing going on. Subtle taste but was enjoyable none the less. Made the hoppy finish stand out alot. The finish kind of dominated while making up for the lack of carbonation in the brew.  Drinkability-Overall a decent drink, maybe lacking a bit of character. Very gentle IPA nothing stands out or overwhelms. Could see downing a few of these fairly quickly due to the lack of anything biting.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Ricelikesbeer,3.73,"Pours darker than most ipa's, and is more of a copper, dark orange color than most.  This beer is bitter straight through, and has a very short-lasted malt sweetness, almost a caramel flavor. This quickly fades away to pine and floral hop notes, and a strong bitter finish.  This beer goes great with chile, and with many mexican dishes. It's a creeper at 6.7%, and one that has gotten many of my friends drunk on many occasions.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Drazzamatazz,4.1,"Enjoy by Dec. 1, 2009.  A - Poured a beautiful tarnished copper with creamy colored two-finger head, not very good retention though. Did seem to have decent lacing.  S - Hoppy, but not overly so, more like breathing in deep in the middle of the forest. A subtle sweetness can be detected along with a slight floral aroma.  T - First comes the slight sweetness, then hops and a slight bitterness, finishes with a dry floral citrus aftertaste.  M - Quite crisp, medium sustain, holds on in the middle of the mouth into the next sip.  D - I could have a couple of these in a row, and I think I'd enjoy every one, very easily drinkable IPA that has enough going on to keep you coming back for more.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

This particular HopDevil had an ""Enjoy By"" Date of Aug 19, 2007. Well that was over two years ago, but I was interested in how this might have aged. It was amazing! The hops had mellowed significantly letting the strong malt presence take center stage. The aroma is dominated by sweet floral honey and only a mild dose of citris. The flavor is similar, with a pronounced malt sweetness up front, balanced by alcohol and a spicy hop finish. This was almost a sipping beer that got even better as it warmed.

S- Smells of hops very florally, fruity maybe grapefruit.  T- Excellent very well balanced hops hit the palate but not overwhelming. Like previous reviews leaves a lingering of hops and grapefruit taste on the back of your tongue. Very good.  M- Medium bodied decent carbonation, again very well done here.  D- Very drinkable, at 6.7% it can get on you quick, but overall a great Pale Ale. East Coast steps their game up with this brew.

I noticed the orange flavor more and more as it warmed. A lot more malt than I'm used to in American IPAs but definitely still big on the hops. I was very pleased overall. I generally like malts more than hops so the balance in this beer suited my tastes. I'd recommend it to people who aren't super hopheads or maybe are looking for an entry point into the world of American IPAs.

Sticky resiny hops in the aftertaste and back of the tongue. It lingers a good bit and I enjoy it.  M - Light carbonation, medium body, smooth and crisp  D - its drinkable and well balanced, I could enjoy a few.

Still looks appealing though, with a nice fluffy white head and substantial lacing. Taste is a combination of rich malts and bitter hops.  Hops lean more to the pine side of the spectrum. The bottle does say enjoy by 11/09/09, so I don't think it's a bad bottle. Mouthfeel is kind of heavy, as I've seen with other Victory brews. Still relatively good and actually kind of sessionable, considering the ABV.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,DerBayer,3.98,I really like this. The chestnu colour is mouthwatering and the taste and smell are a symphony of bitter piney hops and some maple syroup malts.

I will have to revisit this soon.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,woosterbill,3.46,"On-tap at Delaney's in a pint glass.  A: Dark amber (almost brown) body topped by a half-inch of thick, rich, off-white foam with admirable retention. Good lacing. One of the darkest IPAs I've ever seen. Nice.  S: Nothing but thick, resinous, piney hops. Appetizing enough, but one-dimensional.  T: Pure bitterness. The pineyness of the nose is subsumed in a straight-forward attack of bitter astringency. Some semi-sweet malts act like they want to peek out at the end, but the hops quash this futile desire without remorse. One of the hoppiest regular IPAs I've ever had (maybe THE hoppiest), but the lack of any kind of balance with malts OR complexity of hop profile leaves me underwhelmed, hop-head though I am.  M: Good carbonation, but a little sharp for the medium-light body.  D: The bitterness just doesn't leave any room for exploration and discover, and thus I'm left without a desire to keep drinking.  Notes: While I normally can't get enough of hops, this beer just bores me with its one-dimensionality. I thought exactly the same thing when I had a six-pack a couple months ago, but I thought I'd give it another shot and review it on tap. Unfortunately, I was similarly disappointed.

345,1005,Thur123,3.57,"This claims to be the real deal...hmm...Pours a deep ruby red/orange color with a slight off white head. Carbonation looks good and this brew is also somewhat hazy. The smell is robust but well balanced hop bitterness with a sweet malt smell underneath. A slightly sticky citrus stank comes through as well but its far more subtle then the floral aroma. A more complex smell then I would have guessed.  Glug glug glug  Hits slightly sweet but the floral hops take over my tongue and wreak havoc at the back of my tongue, where they linger in the aftertaste, there's a really lemon tart acidic citric element. The mouth feel is a little sticky but overall pretty good. The carbonation really bolsters this brew. After the first few sips the floral punch seems to mellow some, letting less powerful taste come through. Pretty good, but could use a bit more sweetness to the bitterness and just a bit more malt profile...IMHO.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

I was not a big fan of this beer - I enjoy IPA's, but this one seemed all hops and nothing else.

Taste: The hops are definately there but not overly dry and mix nicely with a bready malt and a nice hint of salt and acidic citrus.  Mouthfeel: Has a smooth medium bodied feel with a crisp undertone. Coats the mouth with a film of hop oil like a fumigator to mark its territory.

I guess I let the hype get to me because I'm still a bit disappointed. I even refused to review the first two times I tried it, thinking that the bottles weren't fresh enough, but, alas, it's a good IPA that still doesn't knock my socks off. There's a fairly strong malt backbone and a healthy hop bitterness, but neither element is extraordinary. If you're into balanced bitterness, this is probably your thing. For me, it lacks the delicate hop flavors that I really love in an IPA. That's certainly not to say that HopDevil is a bad beer. It nearly has the malt backbone of an amber ale. The hops are fairly strong, if a bit one note. It's easy to drink and quite pleasant.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Head falls to a fine net of tiny bubbles that cover the beer, Good Lacing. Plenty of carbonation races up the walls of the glass.  S - Amazing Smell. Lots of sweet grape fruit up front with a more of a pine finish. Complementary caramel malt accentuated the bitter hop aroma at the end. Slight malt undertones.  T - Simply amazing. There is a very powerful citrus hops up front that seem to be sweetened by the malts. The taste moves towards a hint of a yeasty sweet bred towards the middle. And finishes clean on the palette with a Spicy bitter taste that doesn't linger too long. The malt doesn't seem to separate its self ever from the Hops, it's a cohesive taste the whole way through.  M - Medium Bodied finish very light and dry with an ever so slight warming feeling. Awesome carbonation, just right.  O - It just doesn't last long enough. The first impression is of IPA is that its not overpowering enough, then after a few sips the beer becomes perfectly balanced with malt and just the right amount of hops.

A: Poured a bright, hazy and clear orange amber color with a frothy, two-finger head of ivory foam. Carbonation was nil yet suspended compounds were entrancing.  S: Smells slightly spicy and alcoholic with a nice zesty, floral hop aroma and a little breadiness.  T: Taste is not as overly pungent with hops as expected, but rather it is clean, smooth and malty to start, with a good crisp, bready caramel flavor. This gives way to a nice bouquet of acidic citrus and herbal hop flavors. A smooth, dry finish earmakrs this as a nice, clean session IPA.  M: Mouthfeel is crisp, smooth and medium bodied with a clean and satisfying finish.  D: A very drinkable and well crafted IPA by Victory.

My tongue is assaulted with a bitterness then followed my a malty, grainy, almost bready citrus. Maybe a little pepper in there too...  I've seen this beer on the shelf numerous times, but for some reason never picked it up. Worth checking out. Something to share with friends.

345,1005,nomomentwasted,4.03,"Had this out of six-pack bottle last night during our IPA tasting night. Poured into a pint glass and away we go.  Appearance: Orange-brown-gold with a nice, billowy white head that maintains its form well and stays true to the style with a nice lacing as it goes down. Very nice bottlework too.  Smell: Slightly grapefruity with some malty tones in the nose as well. You can also pick up a bit of the prickly and spicy alcholic notes as well, leading to the impression of a fairly balanced IPA (and by balanced, I mean West-Coast balanced. It's almost its own style anymore).  Taste: The smell in liquid form. Solid hops with more bitterness than I was expecting, Alpha-Acids are definitely at work here in their bittering role, with a nice malt foil at work against the hops, leading towards a more synergized and balanced. The grainy taste as well works as the more secondary and smoothing finish as well. Alcohol is there as well and will not be written off, providing a slight spiciness that adds a little something extra too.  Mouthfeel: Amply carbonated and bitter upfront, leaving a nice, full-bodied aftertaste that coats the mouth until the next sip. Not too resinous or damp, but not dry either. Pleasant.  Drinkability: I prefer my IPAs to be a bit hoppier to be completely honest, but this is by no means something I wouldn't like to drink. It's an enjoyable East Coast IPA, which is saying something for me as my preference is definitely the San Diego / West Coast style. It's not my ace-in-the-hole IPA so to speak, but it's one that when cooking, I'll keep in mind for something a bit spicier, as the taste would be great with some Thai food.

Nice looking pour, as always, from Bell's brews  S: Super hoppy nose! Caramel or amber malts in the background balance this pretty well. The hop profile is more bittering than floral in my opinion, which is not something I generally like, but the malts balance well enough to make up for it.  T: Very citrusy hops dominate the profile. Grapefruit, lemon peel, and bitter hops. Malts are present in the background but do not balance the beer as I wanted them too. Truly a hop-head's delight, but I tend to be more about balance than to let hops run rampant- super bitter.

Very standard looking with a one and a half finger head that dies down to about half a finger in about a minute. Pretty good looking beer, no flaws but it's not incredible.  Smells piney with malts. Pretty standard as welll. Nothing too intriuguing. Kinda wish there was more nose in this one but that's okay.  Taste is good. Piney hops with some caramel malts. The hops of course are front and center but not overwhelming. Not very complex, was hoping for more here. But overall, a good tasting beer.  Mouthfeel is generic. I don't mean that in a bad way, it's definitely a good feeling to roll this around in your mouth a bit but it's not creamy or anything. Goes down smooth, decent amount of bubbles, kinda lighter but true to the style.  Drinkability is rather high since it is a normal ABV beer and tastes pretty good.

The sweet malts really jump out at me with very little citrus or pine.  Taste -- Again, much like the smell, the malt really jumps on my palette at the start. As a newer IPA fan I've found that I'm a big fan of the west coast style IPA with heavy Cascade and Columbus hops...this beer really pointed out the big difference between east and west coast as the hops really kicked in on the backside with a nice bitterness to clean some of that malt off my palette. Totally different experience but not all that bad.  Mouth Feel -- the moderate level of carbonation is a great complement to the sequence of flavors of the beer.

The hops are definitely present, but there is absolutely a sweetness that balances this IPA very well. Maybe not enough hops to satisfy DIPA lovers, but definitely get the job done for me. Malts seem to kick in more after drinking for a while.  Great carbonation, but nothing absolutely amazing. Just smooth and medium bodied.  Drinkability is great for this beer.

The brew could be a little more substantial on the body side of things but is average. Too much malt for my expectation of a ""hopdevil"". I expect a lot from AIPAs as they are often synonymous with DIPAs. There is not a substantial level of hop character and what hop character is present is diminished by the malt content.

345,1005,Reaper16,3.44,"12oz. bottle served into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass  Pours a rich honey color with good clarity. The cream-colored head is sizable at 1 1/2 fingers with rocky lacing.  The aromas are very, very muted for some reason. Some weak cracker malt smells and light grassiness are all that I get. This bottle expires on 10/13/09, so the hops shouldn't have faded out completely... no choice but to score it low.  Ah, that's better. The hops haven't faded, evidenced by the floral hit of flavor at the tip of the tongue. The gentle hop kiss informs the generous malt bill. This isn't a malt bomb, but the caramel and slight toasted malt flavors are highly assertive. The hops take over on the finish, delivering a blast of pine and grapefruit alpha acid yumminess on the back end of the drink. The lingering aftertaste is very gentle; just a trace of bitterness. Ultimately, this is a very balanced IPA.  Mouthfeel is a little too watery for my tastes; I noticed the ""watery"" quality from the very first drink. Drinkability, however, is excellent. The predominant feeling of balance -- good malt tastes not being overpowered by the nice hopping -- makes this a beer that you can drink as much of as you would like to. The relatively low ABV% of 6.7 helps in this regard, too.  I can't buy beers from Victory in MO (where I live). If I could, I don't think that I would buy HopDevil over other, more local, options for a balanced IPA. I think that I brought home the wrong six pack of Victory product with me from Illinois. That said, this is a solid beer with a lot of positive attributes going for it.

This is a balanced IPA. There is almost more deep roasted malt here than hops. Piney and biting hops come in at the end. Some citrus peel is also present. Hops are starting to emerge more as I drink on.  Medium bodied, nice velvety carbonation lends to a pleasant mouthfeel.  Due to the balance, this is a really drinkable IPA. I would have this one again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,bjacobsen,3.98,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Stone AB pint glass.  A- Orange meets Amber color with a thick 1 inch head. Sufficient lacing to stick to the sides as it dissipates.  S- Hops and spice on the nose up front. Some caramel malt is present as well.  T- Nice. The hop presence is totally put in check by the malty middle. Bittersweet dry finish. After a few minutes, and a few sips, the malt becomes more pronounced. Balanced and subdued flavor profile, but masterfully achieved.  M- Medium bodied.  D- One of the more drinkable IPA's I've had in a while. As a southern california resident, I enjoyed the restrained hop profile of this nice IPA as a nice change of pace from the extreme (but tasty) DIPA's that seem to be everywhere out here. Certainly more sessionable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Not as powerful as the West Coasters, but sometimes i prefer this balance when it comes to drinkability.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,bobsy,4.1,"Pours a nice deep copper with an off-white head that showed good retention and lace. Good balance in the aroma, with the hops providing floral and citrus notes, while the malts provide a background of breadiness. This balance is extended to the flavour. Pine, orange peel and grass lead off, without overpowering the beer due to the fruity and bready malts in the background. Hop oils coat the tongue to provide a lingering bitterness after the sip is finished. Medium bodied and slick, with a soft carbonation.  BALANCE - many IPAs don't have it, but this one does. Good stuff.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Aroma is a bit malty with some earthy hops to it, very good for an IPA.  Taste is rather surprising, very malty but it's still got a good amount of hops to it. Slightly sweet, and a solid bitterness that lingers for a bit. The mouthfeel is phenomenal, very full and smooth with a good amount of carbonation.  This is a very solid IPA in a sea of Imperials & Doubles, it's nice to have a real solid IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,beerwolf77,4.42,Poured from my bottle into my glass the beer is dark orange. With little to no head. The aroma is strong hops a touch of ctirus and malt. The flavor is very nice. Not as hoppy as I thought it would be considering the menacing looking hop cartoon on the bottle. This beer seems to be balanced nicely with malt flavors and a major hop blast. The hop bitterness slaps your taste buds then the malt comes in and smooths things over. Perfect balance. Medium body with fairly mild carbonation. No real sticky hop after taste. This is a top notch IPA. I would highly reccamend this to all my friends.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Gtreid,3.92,"Review from notes. 12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass.  A: Clear, amber color. A smooth pour produced about one finger of cream colored head that left some nice lace.  A: Nothing too overpowering here, I get the pine and citrus hops, grapefruit, and grass. The malts actually balance this quite well IMO.  T: Again very similer to the aroma. I am pleasantly suprised to find how balanced this is. The hops are very prominent, but the brewers uses the malt nicely.  M: Medium body, very carbonated. Comes with a bite.  D and overall impression: Good scores on drinkability here. 6.7% ABV coupled with the balance of the brew, means I could drink quite a few of these. Overall, another soild offering from Victory. This bottle was pretty fresh, but I would really like to try this on tap to experience Hop Devil at it's freshest.

Smell is effervescent orange peel, pine, earth, with a mild spiciness and florality. Very alive smell.  Taste is a sweet and bitter blast that ricochets through a blitzkrieg of fine flavor. Toasted notes, caramel, citrus, pine, inflict delicious pleasure. The finish is thick, sweet, earthy, bitter, and long.  Mouthfeel is good for the style, medium bodied but drinks slightly thicker, perhaps a touch too carbonated, good retention, decent clear out.

345,1005,OldSchoolGamer,4.15,"I have been a big Victory fan for awhile, but never got around to reviewing any of their beers. I consider this my go-to Victory beer. Here is my review:  A: Pours a real deep amber color. Pretty dark for an IPA. Very clear with a nice tan head. Dissipates to a film over the top of the beer. Minimal lacing.  S: Lots of fruit and hops on the nose. Quite piney. Smells nice.  T: A very balanced and tasty IPA. The initial flavor is pine and earthy hops. Then, mid-palate, a unique fruit character comes in. Taste reminds me of a pear or apple. Then the malt comes through with a nice toasty and caramelly flavor. Finish is both bitter and sweet. A very good tasting IPA, but not great.  M/D: Medium bodied and very smooth. Drinks very well with a nice lingering bitterness. Could easily session this beer. Not the best tasting IPA around, but never disappoints and is always enjoyable.  I enjoy this IPA quite a bit from Victory. This has just as much emphasis on the malt as it does the hops. Extremely balanced and drinkable, this is well worth seeking out.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,DanielClouser,4.3,"12 oz bottle into shaped Dogfish Head pint glass (my new go-to glass for IPAs, since I got it for free at a bar on a trip to Pittsburgh).  HopDevil is the beer that made me love beer. While many craft beer drinkers graduate from macros to quality brews, I couldn't stand beer until I accepted a HopDevil just to be polite... then rudely demanded several more!  A--Decent head, though one must pour just right to get the full effect. When poured so that it billows above the rim of the glass, it laces admirably down the glass. Color is right on target for the style.  S--Hops in the nose, obviously, but there's a nice complexity here, with fruity esters and a nice malt presence. It all blends into a singular aroma that really distinguishes the beer.  T--Classic East Coast IPA--a deep, clean bitterness, with pine-y and floral hops flavors that mesh nicely with fruity esters and malts that announce their presence without becoming assertive, suggesting caramel and even chocolate.  M--Good carbonation, etc. Mouthfeel isn't a huge category for me, unless I find it unbelievably amazing or just awful. HopDevil's mouthfeel is right for the style, so everything is good.  D--The 6.7% ABV may take this one out of session range, but apparently no one told my tongue, 'cause I can drink HopDevil all night. Even if you've had too many to appreciate its nuances, it remains agreeable, with a bitterness that lingers pleasantly (a contrast to some of the tongue rapings I've gotten from some other hoppy American brews).  I really love this beer. I will say that it's nothing special when it's past its prime, but fresh--as this particular batch is--it's great. Try it!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

The hop smell is not overpowering, and has a nice sweet/fruit smell, like that of grapefruit possibly a hint of honey. The head reduces to about 1/4 inch as you drink, with a nice amount of lace down the side of the glass. The taste is smooth with a good mouth feel. The hop flavor hits midway through the drink, and continues to the end, leaving a nice hop taste on the back of the tongue.

It was on tap and for a beer at 9am served with a breakfast of greasy sausages and eggs it went down pretty well. Today I'm reviewing the bottled version which tastes remarkably similar.  It pours a clear but medium caramel colour body and a small offwhite head that settles to practically nothing in just a few minutes.  The smell is mostly of fruity sweet malts with some hops mixed in.  The taste is very hop dominated.. strong hops, pine and grapefruit hit you and overwhelm the taste. Where are the sweet malts? Where are the fruity yeasts? Not here unfortunately. I enjoy hops as much as the next hop head but nothing but hops isn't terribly rewarding.  Mouthfeel is good and the carbonation is refreshing. Drinkability is better than average.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Taste is very creamy, hoppy but very mellow with a clean finish and malt sweetness apparent right behind the hop. Mouth is silky, not heavy at all. The creaminess is quite delightful.

Not a very potent smell for an IPA. The taste is bigger than the smell would suggest, hops up front, then some sweet notes, followed by a nice bitter hop flavor. The bitter aftertaste sticks around for awhile. The mouthfeel is smooth, nice carbonation, the flavors have a good balance and are well layered.

M - Perfectly carbonated and balanced  D - High, but my tongue went numb after 2-3, maybe it's cause I am not used to such hoppy beers.  Overall, a fantastic IPA that I will definitely drink again.

(S)- Creamy pine with citrus of lemon, lime, grapefruit, and pineapple. Malty background evident. Almost has a peach/floral aroma in there too.  (T)- Again, super creamy citrus of pineapple and grapefruit. Good hop bite that is balanced nicely with a malty sweet finish.  (M)- A nice creamy citrus mouthfeel that moves into the bitterness of hops and then you experience the slightly sweet malts at the end. This beer is really nicely balanced and the flavors are layered in such a way that you get one after another. Solid carbonation.  (D)- A great and enjoyable IPA that has a bit more malt to it than most, but I really enjoy it.

345,1005,Cylinsier,3.43,"Pours a deep but clear amber with a finger's worth of oat colored head. Dissipates slowly to a bit of lacing.  Smells hoppy and floral. Very potent. The hop aroma is fresh (not dry at all) and overpowers anything else that is there.  The taste echos the smell. Very potent floral hops with the expected hoppy bitterness in the aftertaste. Again, the hops take center stage and make it difficult to sense anything else, but there is a light sweetness in there as well, like a bit of honey.  The mouthfeel is smooth, not thin, and slightly carbonated. The balance is very good for the style.  I'm really just not a big fan of hoppy beers. However, as far as they go, this one of the ones I've enjoyed the most. The floral taste and aroma goes a long way in mitigating the bitter aftertaste for me.

Floral hops over top some biscuity malts and some honey. The nose is nice but it is not powerful as it could be.  T- The biscuity/nutty malts are there underneath the bite of the huge hops. The malts make this go down very well with an almost creamy smoothness at the back of my mouth.

I stared down the devil as it's hoppy breath filled the air, with hints of citrus, fruits, and floral.... evil floral.  It pounced on me and all i could feel was hops, some malt(maybe caramel), and a most dastardly mix of citrus (grapefruit? and orange).  However, the devil took pity on me and his medium build was smooth, almost relaxing.

Very malty in the nose with lots of toasted grain as well as ripe fruits like cherries and apples that synthesize into a pie-like character. Citric hops combine with dark sugars and an unexpected vanilla note to produce hints of cola. Tastes as it smells, lovely, bready, nutty, and bitter with fruity pear, grape, and grapefruit undertones, a hearty almond flavor and a sharp hop bite. However, it's not so sharp that it cuts through the malts - it mostly just perforates them. A bit thick on the palate, which tips the scales in favor of malty sweetness - this would probably be better served another way so that the carbonation makes more of an impact. Still, a very good quaffer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Some malt and citrus oil but once again a unique beer for the group. Seems to get better after air gets to it. Mouth feel changed after the beer was poured and my drinking of it progressed very oily. Not a lot of carbonation. This beer was a bit of a disappointment to me but not bad.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,MrIncognito,3.97,"A - 2-finger pillowy off-white head atop a dark amber brew. Moderate carbonation seen rising to the top. Head leaves great lacing on the glass.  S - Probably my favorite part of this beer. Wonderful floral hops that are a bit spicy and piney. Slight sweetness from the alcohol.  T&M - Very much like the smell. Smooth floral hops hit first followed by a nice malty backbone that brings caramel notes. A bit sticky in the mouthfeel with very moderate carbonation. Hops become bitter on the back of the tongue in the aftertaste leaving a brackish taste and feeling.  D - Easily drinkable for the most part. At the end of the glass my tongue feels a bit briny, but still a pleasant beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,JoshuaJ,2.53,"Pours a clear, light copper color. Big head with zero lacing.  Smells weak, to be honest. Picking up some citrusy grapefruit, a touch of honey. Not much else.  Tastes...completely underwhelming. For a name like ""HopDevil,"" I was expecting a massive hop bite. Not so, here. It's a lot more balanced than what I was expecting, but in this case, it's not a good thing. Weak, citrusy hops flavor meet weak, biscuity malts. Did someone fill half my bottle up with water?  Mouthfeel is thin. The beer finishes dry, which is nice, but it just feels an anorexic version of what everyone else has been reviewing.  Overall drinkibility suffers from the high expectations not being met in regards to the nose and taste, and the thin consistency. I suppose I'd have another if it was offered to me, but I won't be buying another.  Notes: The date on the bottle says to enjoy by 10/09, which I've obviously done, but I can't shake the feeling that something must have ""off"" with this batch. It's not been contaminated per se. Just extremely watery.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,drtth,4.5,"Chilled and poured into a Duvel glass. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically. (Given how many of these I've had over the years I was surprised to find I had not reviewed this one yet.)  Appearance: The beer pours out a clear dark reddish dark copper color with a 1"" fluffy light tan head that recedes slowly leaving dimples in the head and rings of lacing around the glass. Eventually the foam recedes to a ring around the glass with a patch of foam in the middle before it all disappears. From the start, sipping leaves speckles, lines and a spider-web of lacing on the sides of the glass. Even as the beer is almost gone sipping leaves lines and occasional speckles of lacing.  Smell: Upon opening the bottle an aroma which seems an equal mix of dark caramel malt, grapefruit and orange zest fill the air and the nose making this one quite nicely balanced IPA.  Taste: The flavor contains major components of grapefruit and orange zest from the hops and sweet dark caramel from the malt all initially in balance. Then the malt ramps up to soften the bitterness but before long the orange zest and grapefruit bitterness come sliding back in to reassert themselves again.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is medium or medium-full bodied and has fair amount of prickly carbonation. The finish is long and begins with some caramel malt sweetness but then the dry citric bitterness chimes in, takes over, and goes on and on and on, particularly in the back of the mouth.  Drinkability: This is one of my favorite IPAs. Not only is it local it is always fresh and well balanced. I could drink more than one of these a night and have lost track of how many I've finished off the last few years. If what you are looking for is an IPA without a strong malt backbone look elsewhere, but if you favor IPAs with both bitterness and malt sweetness to balance against the hops, look no further.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,caddybuyer,4.33,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle from the Taste Victory 12 pack.  A-Copper amber with filtered clarity and a huge eggshell head that lasts forever. Damn, this is one fine looking brew.  S-Pungent floral and citrus hops with a wee bit of sweet malts peeking in the back.  T-Lighter and more balanced than expected from the nose...I really thought this was going to be a hop bomb, but it starts with sweet caramel malts, balanced with some bitter hops in the initial taste, then the floral and predominatly citrus hops roll in, (but not too heavy) with a crisp, clean astringent finish. Nicely done.  M-Well balanced overall with a medium mouthfeel, and ample carbonation.  D-This is a dangerously drinkable brew, and one that leaves you pining for another.  Not sure if I'd call this an IPA, but whatever it is, it is a winner. I'll gladly buy this anytime. Works well as a summer quencher and will be equally enjoyed in the colder months.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,dismal,3.85,"Pours a really nice dark amber, kind of dark copper color. Has small off white head that quickly dissolves fairly fast to a thin layer and still manages to leave lacing on the sides. Smell is pretty typical of the style, hops, citrus, grapefruit the usual things. Smells good, not the best I've ever had but it's pretty good. Taste is differant than what I was expecting. Lingering bitterness in the background, and not nearly as hoppy as what I was expecting and what I would have liked. Seems the citrus comes through quite a bit. Really good mouthfeel and drinkability. Easy to drink and not a high really big ABV. Overall pretty good, not one of the best in my opinion but it's still pretty good.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,GeezLynn,4.33,"This is a great looking beer - Cloudy, copper-reddish tint with a full white head with great staying power. The fresh hop aroma is very good, but could have a little more behind it - tough to complain but some of the other IPAs out there have set the bar pretty high. Well-balanced flavor in line with what the color would suggest. Easy floral hops with a mild bitterness. A little sweet with some grapefruit and a touch of spicyness. Subtle malt body complements hop flavors nicely. Mouthfeel is good but leaves something to be desired. A little undercarbonated and not much stickyness - almost too smooth for my preference. All in all, a complex, yet very drinkable India Pale that lives up to its great reputation.  For those of you who like their IPAs on the copper/red part of the spectrum, this is a great one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,rtepiak,4.35,"an excellent IPA of a murky amber, nice head of white yellow. well hopped... but also well malted. a wonderful range of fruit citrus: lemon, orange, but also apple even... and a mango. the malt is just as bold. bready and not too thick. a bit of toast and butter quality to it like some english style IPA's. excellent rendition. a recommended IPA on my behalf absolutely.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Aenema,3.91,"Appearance - Pours a clear caramel with a thin white head and very nice bands of lacing. Smell - Citrus, sweet malt. Taste - Grapefruit, toasty malt. Nice intense hop flavor.

345,1005,mothman,3.86,"Poured into Sierra Nevada Tulip Glass  Pours a 1 and 1/2 finger creamy and fizzy yellowish-cream colored head. Great retention and amazing lace walls! This really makes the beer look excellent. Solid flow of carbonation bubbles from the etching. Color is clear dark ruby/golden bronze.  Aroma: I really pick up the bready malts here. Not as hoppy as I was expecting. Floral hops stand out the most. The citrus level is fairly low for an IPA. This is a fairly solid IPA.  Taste: the floral hops are not as pronounced here. There seems to be more fresh earthy hops mixed in. The same bready malts are here. A little booze shines through. ALso there is a mixture of citrus present.  Mouthfeel: Bitter. The booze shines through after left in the mouth for a while. Medium bodied. Medium level of carbonation as well. Leaves a mouth full of floral hops for an aftertaste. Very sticky and dry.  Overall, this was a good IPA for a change. Normally it is all of these DIPAs that are coming out and I hardly drink regular IPAs, so it was nice to get to have one of these. A really good representation to the style and worth a try. I will drink this again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,BigJim5021,4,"Pours a deep copper with a chunky white head that leaves all kinds of lacing.  The smell is all resinous, piny hops. Assertive hoppiness makes for my kind of IPA.  The flavor is eerily reminiscent of SN Celebration Ale. Maybe a touch more malty, but not by much. The piny hops are the star of the show.  Mouthfeel is a fine middle ground between crisp and creamy. Dryness is right where it should be.  Drinkability is pretty high. This isn't the best IPA around, but it's yet another damn good beer from a really fantastic brewery. Victory makes tasty beer and that's all there is to it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,NewGeneric,4.1,"Had this at the Philly airport. Poured a beautiful bronze/copper color with white head and good lacing. Smelled very hoppy with grapefruit tones.

So good, I had to have two more before we caught our plane.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,IceTrey9785,4.62,"I bought a 6-pack for $8.99 -- pretty good for an American IPA.  A: Nice amber color with a great pearl head. The retention was really good -- it just looked like a beer that I wanted to drink. Fairly medium-bodied (not thick and syrupy like Dogfish Ales).  S: Abundance of citrus-hop aromas. Actually reminded me of the hops found in a lot of New Zealand ales. Orange zest and pine, with a touch of brown sugar.  T: You'd expect a really bitter beer, but the guys at Victory have done it again -- a rather creamy, but spiced beer. Layers of toasted malt really compliment the zesty hops in the brew. I wouldn't say it is ""well-balanced"" -- you have to love hops to love this one. The taste of the hops almost hints at blood orange and basil when it reaches room temperature. So complex and satisfying -- definitely a keeper.  This is a fantastic beer. Thankfully, at least ONE micro-brew in the country understands that you can have a nice IPA without jacking up the alcohol and sugar to bring it into balance. I enjoyed this with some excellent Thai cuisine, and I would gladly drink it on its own anytime! Great job -- highly recommended!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,John_M,4,"Had not had this beer in some time, but saw it on tap at the Judge's Bench last night, and figured why not.  The beer pours a rich copper color, with pretty good head retention and lacing. This beer really doesn't look like an IPA, but it sure smells and tastes like one. On the nose, I get some light bitterness and pepper, with a hint of underlying malt. The beer smells as if it will be on the dry side, which in fact it is. On the palate, the beer is a little heavy handed in the malt department, but there's pleny of hoppy bitterness to balance it. In fact, I think the excellent balance in this beer is probably its best feature. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and drinkability is very good. The finish is relatively dry with the alcohol very well disguised.  While nothing exciting, this is still a good solid IPA, one that is very easy to drink with relatively low alcohol. Unfortunately, there are just too many better IPA's on the market these days, for me ever drink this on more then an occasional basis. Nevertheless, this is still a solid IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,Jwale73,4,"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint glass. Poured a slightly hazy copper with a half inch frothy, off-white head the bubbled and effervesced right below the cap; good head retention with spotty bands of lacing as the brew recedes. Nose suggests some grapefruity hops, with caramel on a malty backbone, suggesting sweet flavors in the mouth. Taste consistent with nose - some hops upfront, but finishes malty sweet with just a light bitterness that doesn't linger. Mouthfeel fell between light- and medium-bodied with a pleasant, consistent background effervescence. Nice drinkability, but this is not your typical IPA. It's a bit too malty and less hoppy than I appreciate in the style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Gosox8787,4.55,"Had on tap at a bar in town. I had high expectations for this beer after trying the Hop Wallop earlier this year.  Anyway, the beer was poured into a 16 oz. glass. There was a one finger, light head. The beer was a nice dark red to brown color. Very dark for an IPA. The nose was all hops. A nice balance of resiny pine notes and grapefruit notes. When I took a sip, the flavor hit me in three waves. There was an initial overpowering citrus or grapefruit note. Then some caramel sweetness from the malt briefly came through. It finished with a nice strong pine aftertaste, which a nice bitter aftertaste. Perfectly balanced. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and niely carbonated. Drinkability was only average as the beer's ABV is rather high and flavors are large.  Overall, a great IPA. One of my favorites that I am certainly having whenever I ahve the chance.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,philbe311,4,"A - A rich bronze copper color... Two plus fingers worth of light tan lumpy batter like head... Excellent retention...

Caramel... Toffee... Orange zest... Cracker... Perhaps even the faintest hint of cinnamon...  T - A wonderful mix of hop power - strong and assertive, but not overwhelming... Biscuit... Toffee... A vague nuttiness... Black tea... The hop bitterness lingers for a while...  M - Medium bodied... Lush and slightly creamy... A little viscous and sticky... Strong bitterness factor...

Overall it's pretty well balanced and would be a good introduction to a first time IPA drinker. A little of the mild bitterness lingers but that's alright to me.

I get cirtus on the nose along with piney earthy hop aromas. Grass comes in with a punch of lemon and grapefruit.  Flavor is soapy hops on the front. Interesting hop profile, bitter and piney but with a strange soap like flavor (not the glass). The hops are prominant and I get less grassy flavors from dry hopping than I thought I would get. Tannic tea like flavor int he water. Malt is backing but not hugely prominent. Slight diacetyl flavor and a slight dusty aged flavor. Smallish booziness on the finish.

Little head that quickly fades to a thin layer of foam on top, some lacing. Detect a pleasant smell of hops, floral, and some sweeter citrus notes.  Taste is bold like an IPA should be, but surprisingly complex. Some bread, then the floral hops with their bitterness, with a malty back end that has the citrus I expected from the smell. Maybe a hint of a roasted flavor, or is that the beer showing its age and giving me weird, off tastes? Moderate carbonation is not distracting, very smooth.  Easily a session beer. Its complexity shines through because the hops, though present in a hefty dose, are not overpowering to the palate.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Smell seems very light, mostly a nice hoppy smell, not much else I can detect right now. Taste is a nice hop bite with a solid malty backbone to balance things out. Above average in this category. Carbonation tingles the mouth with this one, feels very light and airy in the mouth, coats the tounge well, overall a very pleasant feel. Drinkability is good on this one, an overall nice IPA that does not disappoint.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

So I bought it anyway. Here-goes...  Served: In a bottle, poured into an ale glass.  A: The body has a copper tone, looks intimidating due to what the beer is supposed to be. A little head formed and left some lacing around the glass as I drank it down.  S: Hops galore along with a hint of spices.  T: An IPA it is indeed. Hops are definitely there; however, the bitterness doesn't bother me for some reason.  M: Hops in the beginning, hops at the end, and hops in the aftertaste. Some spiciness is there too, but it's nothing too special.  D: For me not being a hop-head and able to enjoy this beer... that's saying something. Victory has yet to let me down.

345,1005,aerozeppl,4.03,Finally getting around to reviewing this one.  A: Perfect copper color with tons of bubles leading to a finger of white head. Good head retention with some nice lacing.  S: Nice mild hop aroma. Very much on the floral side of hops. The hops and malt work well together to create a nice spiciness.  T: When I first had this around 10? years ago I remember it being unbearably bitter. Now it is not bitter enough. Fairly well balanced IPA.  M: Medium bodied with only a touch of syrupy feel. Just enough while making it a daily drinker.  D: Just a great beer that is always available around here. Even better and more refreshing on tap.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

The nose is pure and fresh: floral hops, a spicy kick with malts, grains and citrus in the back. Hops aroma is a combination of the pine and grapefruit aromas of a pure brew. Hops hit the palate first with a very nice bitterness that never quite lets go. An assault of earthy resin and grapefruit aromas is supported by a biting spiciness and a clean malt back with some grains. Citrus is ever present with a very subtle hint of honey. The finish is pretty dry and lingers very well. The body is moderate to full and very smooth. This one is somehow clean and somewhat simple in the ingredients used, yet at the same time a pretty complex brew.

T - Grapefruit, spicy hoppiness balanced with a sweet, toasty malt finish that lingers along with the hops. Some resinous piney flavors detectable as well. Great balance of flavors with a nice level of bitterness and not too much on the sweet side of things.  M - Medium bodied with a fairly strong resinous feel. Good level of carbonation.  D - Very delicious and drinkable brew overall. Nice complexity of flavors that all balance out well.

345,1005,originalsin,4.08,This could very well be the most drinkable ipa I've ever tasted. The pour was a great amber color with a full inch of sticky white head. It had a bready floral hoppy smell. The taste isn't quite as devilish as expected but it has a bit of a hoppy bite. Perhaps the name comes from the 6.7 abv but otherwise we may have a small case of mislabeling here but whatever.

345,1005,bluetravlr,4.33,"A: Nice clear, amber coloration. About a finger of initial head dies down quickly. Still, a slight amount of foam lingers leaving just a bit of lacing.  S: Spicy hops immediately present. Dark resin with citrus, flowers, and pine. Slight breadyness with a touch of molasses.  T: A crisp, clean (yet slightly peppery) flavor of both floral and citrus is quickly followed by a bready/caramel undertone that continues until the aftertaste. Notes of grapefruit, but especially pine and hop resin, prevail leaving a very floral/peppery aftertaste; as if you sprinkled a bit too much pepper on that cronic salad. Still, nicely balanced yet complex; every sip reveals new flavors. Dare I say this is comparable to a 'spicy' Ruination?  M: Very comparable to Ruination in this aspect. Hop resin that just wont go away, completely coating the palate. Great! Nicely carbonated. Medium-thick body.  D: Very drinkable for hop-heads like myself. The resin is what gets to you before any of the bitterness or alcohol. Definitely meant to be enjoyed and not slammed, and that's just what I'm doing!  The resins, once they coat your palate, really go well with the bready/caramel undertone of this beer, turning these normally flawed features in an IPA into a godsend. Still, the hop-profile is nicely complex. The hops did not seem quite as fresh as those in the Ruination, but this could be due to distribution. Also, there is a distinct peppery flavor to this beer: good, but not as good as fresh hops. Either way, this is one terrific IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Similar to when I spilled a bag of Challenger hops on myself while homebrewing. Very strong and harsh aroma.  This is a definite hop bomb. Basically douple IPA flavor with slightly less alcohol content. I see this as a quick and dirty hop attack on the palate. None of the subtleness from some other IPA's. I was in the mood for some hops and this was perfect. My only problem is the acidic aftertaste that sticks with me. Not nearly as subtle as some better IPA's I've had, and too heavy to really be sessionable, this beer is still a tasty drinker and it didn't take me too long to get through at all.

Perfectly balanced with some dry maltiness and a hint of ethanol. I really love the taste here.  Mouthfeel is great as well. Light and crisp, slightly chewy and heavily carbonated (but it works for this beer).  Drinkability is very high. I would love to spend a nice day drinking this on my lawn.

Spicy malts: toffee, honey and dark toast notes hold for a second but get stomped by oily, nettle, bitter hops. Lingers to a bone dry finish. Prickly carb and sticky but soft mouthfeel. Malts step up as it warms. ABV kicks a bit.  Titanic. Big and assertive, but with no pine burn. Can challenge any West Coast IPA. A classic.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,OtherShoe2,3.92,"Pours an orange amber with an off-white one finger head and some lacing.  Smells of citric hops and piney resin. No doubt what you are getting here.  Big bitter citric and pine hop bite right up front, with some toasted bread and sweet malt in the background. The alcohol fights through, and actually gives you a bit of a break from the hop overdrive here. This one has some surprising balance, where it is a big hop brew, but not to the point where you'd need a break.  Some chewiness, but less than I expected -- same with the mouth coating elements. Not a negative -- keeps this drinkable.  Overall, a great hop-extreme beer. The alcohol level allows this as a multiple beer taster. Worth a try for sure.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Nicely retained 1-finger thick, creamy white head, lots of bubbly lacing.  Smell: Nice, light and bright-smelling citrusy hops that even smell juicy. Not too strong, but strong enough to make my mouth water.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Very excellently balanced is the first thing I think! I'm quite surprised this isn't overwhelming or overpowering based on the style and the name. Nice toasted malt meets a sweetly bitter citrus. The taste is is really refreshing and only slightly sticky. Feel is decently carbonated and light.  Drinkability: Very high - the alcohol is pretty well masked in the taste and the taste is really great.

345,1005,BigBry,4.13,"12 oz bottle, brought back in a build-your-own 6 pack from Raleigh, NC. Enjoy by date on the label, picture as above. Cool looking Hop Devil (complete with horns and an evil grin). From the label: ""The mythical HopDevil resides in the lore of farmers. Our HopDevil is the real deal. Bold, spicy and menacingly delicious. He's the product of distinctive American hops and meticulous craftmanship. Arising from the heady wilds of our Hopback and gently tamed with time, this Devil makes a great companion.""  Slightly cloudy orange color, with pale orangeish foam. Not bad retention, thin sticky lace, suprising for an IPA. The smell is all hops, some spiciness as well. The flavor has more hops and some caramel malt. The hop bite is strong, but there is still lots of malt to keep things in balance. Citrusy grapefruit taste. The body is medium, fills and coats your mouth. Slightly dry finish with a nice hop aftertaste. A ton of hop bitterness, but suprisingly well balanced. A very good beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,alleykatking,4.2,A- Poured into a pint glass. Pours clear golden amber with a half inch off white head that slowly goes away leaving nice lacing that sticks to the sides.  S- Big fruity hop smell with a nice malt undertone. Kind of a sweet smell to this. I like it.  T- I think the hops have faded a little bit in this but still a nice crisp upfront hoppiness to this ending with a nice sweet malt finish. The hops are still at the end too giving this kind of a bitter finish as well.  M- Good carbination with a medium mouthfeel. Hops grind against the palate at first but let up before it goes down.  D- I would like this all the time...wait a minute I might have to start putting this into my current rotation.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Slatetank,3.73,"I had this on tap at Yorgo's in Lancaster PA -served chilled in a pint. I thought I reviewed before, but alas this is my first...  A - Brilliant copper/fiery amber w/ an inch of beige capping the ipa which settles quickly and clings like a sheet as lace. The clarity is very good and the ale has a very fine bead.  S - Nice aroma of hops which are of American origin and subtle malt sweet note. The nose hints as yeast which is almost meaty with its intensity  M - A mild acidity up front and the bitterness is on par for the style. The carbonation is med high and sweetness restrained with only mild malt texture  T - A malt note begins and the taste of American hops (not too bitter but not too tame) a yeasty flavor which has a mild bready taste and the hops seem to exhibit a pine flavor as it warms. The alcohol is evident in the taste as the hop bitterness is fresh like chewing on a pellet, but lacks flavor and just seems bitter without depth. The carbonation makes it hard to enjoy the malt since it overtakes it mostly.  D- A nice IPA, but seems middle of the road in the popular saturated IPA market currently. The beer is drinkable, yes - but not my first choice if I want an American IPA. I think it represents the style well, though.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,lstokes,4.47,"Had this on tap at Victory Brewing Company, and it was delicious! Orange-copper beer with a creamy head, and the smell was citrusy hops with some sweet malt in the background.  Creamy mouthfeel, a sweet malt hit at the beginning which gives way to a spicy and exciting blend of hops--something of a dry and spicy finish which lingers on the palate for a good long while. The carbonation was just right for the taste and hell, I really enjoyed drinking it.  Would definitely drink again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,TheTrevor,3.82,"This beer poured copper with a single-finger head and some visible carbonation. The smell is a bit of malt and a bunch of really nice citrus and floral hops. Gee, I wonder how this beer got its name. The taste starts off with a huge mashup of hop flavor with a surprisingly low amount of bitterness. There's some pine, grassy, citrus, and floral hops. There's some malt in there, but it's desperately trying to hold its own against the hops. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with a medium amount of carbonation. This beer is definitely not going to be for everyone, but if you're a fan of hops there's no reason not to try it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Lots of caramel malts on the nose with a support group of pine and citrus hops.  Initial malts on the palate that give way to a good helping of hops. The finish is very smoky with some resinous hops. Very drying. Somewhat thin mouthfeel with light carbonation.  Aside from the slightly overbearing ABV, this would be easy to drink a lot of.

S: Lots of hops... Grapefruit citrus, orange, grass, and a little caramel and biscuit malt.  T: Grapefruit hops in the initial taste. The mid-taste is dominated by caramel malt, and the finish is grassy hops with some grapefruit again. A simple and satisfying flavor.  M: Medium-bodied, with low-to-medium carbonation.  D: Pretty high, although it would depend on price. This is the kind of thing I wouldn't mind keeping around the hose for normal drinking, if it were locally available at a fair price.

345,1005,bsend,4.1,"Poured this 12 oz. bottle into a standard pint.  Appearance: Beer pours a brown/copper color that looks orange when held to the light. A standard pour provides a soapy/creamy 1 finger white head. Small amounts of lacing present and the head retains itself for a good portion of the beer.  Smell: Smell of wet hops and malt.  Taste: Decent hopped beginnings that make way to a bready/malt backbone before finishing with more hops.  Mouthfeel: Creamy in some areas, it is definitely decent though nothing overly special. Decent smooth carbonation.  Drinkability: This beer goes down easy and doesn't show its 6.7% abv at all. Well worth getting at least a six to session this one.

345,1005,CHADMC3,4.47,"This pale ale pours a hazy orange to copper color with a nice off white head, packed with firm, medium sized carbonation bubbles that sticks around for a while before giving way to a generous lacing.  The citrus hop aroma floats from the glass packing a zesty nostril punch with other grassy notes and even hints of something sweet like honey or molasses, but I'm not completely sure.  Packs puckering citrus hop bitterness on the palate giving way to sweet malt balance mid-palate, but then resuming the grassy hop flavor in the finish. There is also something toasted in the flavor as well.  Very clean brew, medium to light in body with higher than average carbonation. The hop bite remains on the back of the throat throughout the beer, but is very pleasant.  Another great Victory beer, well balanced, easy to enjoy, and quite satisfying without too high of an abv. Also a great bargain versus its similarly priced competition.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,johnmichael712,4.17,"Appearance: Poured out of a 12 oz bottle into a nonic pint glass. The bottle tells me to enjoy by June 26, 2009, but I'm not exactly sure of the time frame between the bottled on date and the freshness date. This beer pours a beautiful dark amber color with orange highlights, and is a few shades darker than the Thomas Creek Class Five IPA I had earlier today. Holding this beer up to a lamp allows me to appreciate its remarkable clarity. The head is a medium khaki color that doesn't look like it'll be sticking around for too long considering the negligible amount of carbonation bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. The head has moderate retention, and eventually fades to a small wisp atop the surface of the beer, but it still manages to leave a hearty amount of lace behind.  Smell: The nose of this beer is very punchy, with a citrusy hop character that leaves no doubt in the mind that Northwestern American hops were used in this brew. The website doesn't give any names, but I have a feeling they all start with a ""C"". All the usual players are here, grapefruit, papaya, and orange zest, and Victory has done a wonderful job with bringing out these wonderful hop aromas. There are also hints of leafy hoppiness, a bit of spice, and some caramel malt, but this is definitely a C-hop dominated nose.  Taste: I thought I had tasted some malt dominant IPA's in my lifetime, but I think I can safely say that Victory's HopDevil takes the cake. This beer starts out with an absolute truckload of sweet malt, with hints of toasted bread and caramel coming along for the ride. After this, however, the hops steal the show, and it's an all out brawl between citrus flavors (grapefruit and bitter orange peel), leafy/floral hop flavors, and enough tongue-bruising bitterness to satisfy even the biggest of hopheads. These flavors eventually subside to a slightly dry, bitter, and very spicy finish that lingers on the palate for an absolute eternity. I think it's worth noting that drinking this beer reminded me of a less malty but hoppier Bigfoot, and those of you that have tasted both beers know exactly what I mean.  Mouthfeel: Very nice medium to medium-full body, especially for an IPA. The thick, malty body is heavenly smooth on the tongue, and the moderate carbonation only adds to the smoothness. Swirling this beer around in the mouth is a delight, and this is a very good mouthfeel for an IPA.  Drinkability: I feel like a broken record when I say that I'm not the sort of person that could ever drink more than one IPA or DIPA in a row, so I don't rate drinkability for these beers on whether or not I'd have another. Instead, I like to focus on how easily drinking one bottle is/was, but sometimes certain things bear repeating. With that in mind, I'm not having any trouble finishing this glass, and in the months that I can't buy Bell's Hopslam Ale I can definitely see myself buying this beer again.  Notes: I've read that the late Michael Jackson was a big fan of Victory's HopDevil, and after tasting it I can see why. This is definitely one of my favorite American IPA's to date, but only time (and more beer!) will tell if it can hold its position. The boys at Victory have done it again, and they continually establish themselves as power players in the American craft beer scene. Victory for my taste [buds]? You bet.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,disastermouse,4.45,"A - Coppery golden-brown. Thin head dissipates quickly.  S - Malty and hoppy - like a burnt bitter, in a good way.  T - Wow! I would not have expected such a perfect balance. With a name like 'Hopdevil', I expected the malt to be completely drowned out by the hops. Oddly, the malt hits first, lightly with the carbonation, before the hops swoop in and take it down your throat. This is unexpected for an IPA (American or otherwise)- a style that I did not appreciate until fairly recently.  MF- Sharp and cutting, not at all cloying or sticky.  D - This is a beer that could tempt you to have one too many. A moderate alcohol content is hidden by the hops, though. It's crisp and clean and if the hop bitterness doesn't overwhelm your palate, you'll drink more than one. This is also a good beer to introduce the IPA style to the uninitiated - it has all the hoppy goodness, but the moderate malt flavor may prevent one from equating 'IPA' with 'soap' as I once did.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

D: Pretty high. It's strong, not entirely sessionable but hop heads could pull it off.  Man this is a really good beer. One of my favs. These hop oils linger, and they're well balanced in the mouth.

345,1005,rodney45,4.25,"The carbonation in this beer seems to float, suspended in its amber red beauty, sort of like fine dust particles flying through the sun lit air of a warm childhood memory. Smells like spring time, and hops... mostly hops though... im sure they're either cascade or centennial... but im not sure, maybe a mix. A strong hop attack, all at once, all of a sudden. I get the malt flavor too, a bit tannic, but has a nice roasted, burnt flavor that I can totally deal with... In fact, I like that in this beer, the toasted malt complements the hop characteristics... A lot can be said on the floral, citrus, and grapefruit notes of the hops, but the main point of this beer is that its over balanced, hop wise.

345,1005,goatgoat,3.86,"Thanks to mikereaser for the opportunity.  Pours a clear coppery amber. A goodly amount (~2 fingers) of off-white head falls leaving a good amount of lace. Obvious trails of bubbles make their way up through the brew.  Aroma is a smack of citrus hops when poured. Resinous. A little caramel malt in there as well. Pretty simple.  It takes less than half a second for the hop bitterness and flavor to dominate the initial sip. Flavor presents a stronger floral note than the aroma. Long lasting steady bitterness in the finish. The malt becomes more apparent through the course of a pint, while still . Due to warming or palate habituation to the bitter kick? Don't know, just know I like it.

Flavor: I can taste citrus from the hops, a prominent bitter bite, and a strong malt base.  Mouth feel: There is a bite of astringency of the back of the tongue. The body is medium light. The over all taste is clean with minimum after taste.  Overall Impression: A fine beer that embodies all that is good with American IPAs. The American hops show up in the aroma and taste.

345,1005,gellmeister,4.42,"Have had this IPA from both a bottle and a growler, since one of my friends lives right near the brewery in Downingtown, PA. This review was written during/after several glasses that I poured out of growler transported from Downingtown to State College, PA.  Lacy head, pours one to two fingers out of the growler - a bit more if you mistakenly pour too fast.  Orange amber color is nice, although I prefer unfiltered offerings and this one seems to be partially filtered.  Fruity/citrous overtones are present, in addition to the ever present hop scent, which makes this one of the better smelling beers that I consume on a regular basis.  Nice hoppy taste, but not overpowering, as in some IPA's or DIPA's. The citrous comes through only vaguely during consumption. This is clearly not a fruity wheat beer with hops added as an afterthought.  The aftertaste of this beer is most pleasing to my palate. It's not an overpowering hop flavor, but the hops are clearly evident long after you've put the glass down!  I could drink many glasses of this without batting an eye. I can't say that for a lot of other IPA's that I've tried. For an East Coast person that has limited access to West Coast IPA's, which are more numerous and generally higher in caliber, this beer is a winner. It ranks up there with Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA as my favorite ""local"" IPA. I also recommend Troegs Hopback Amber Ale.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

I could smell this beer and Dogfish Head's 90 min IPA all day long. It just makes my mouth water.  The first thing that hits you upon the taste is the hop citrusy sweetness...almost overwhelming pineapple and grapefruit tartness. The finish is slightly dry with hop bitterness at the end. You have to be a hop head (which I defiantly am) to enjoy this beer. If you prefer sweeter European brews then you won't be as enthralled with this beer.

345,1005,thehosh,4.35,"Right off the bat, this beer, my first taste from Victory, completely took me by surprise. I expected another, basic, drinkable-but nothing special IPA that I could start my night with. Instead I found one of the better beers I have had at home in a while. I had been working at home all day and finally got to sit down to watch the second Final Four game in my chair and this stepped up to meet me.  Poured into a basic pint glass (actually an Oscar Blue's Gordon glass...) pours a nice, warm, rich, curious amber in color. This beer looked immediately delicious. It was virtually headless, just some slight lacing. Its head dissipated almost completely about 1/4 into this beer.  HopDevil's smell is enticing, and again surprisingly sweet.  This beer's taste is what caught me completely off guard. It was sweet, rich and buttery at the top. This beer hit my mouth and immediately made me sit up and give it the attention it deserves. The ending hopfeel was amazing. I am hop crazy right now (have been since last summer) and I found this to be one of the most balanced hop beers I have had in a while.  This IPA did not murder your mouth like some hop-fabulous beers do. While I appreciate those that do, but for this evening, this beer was the perfect beginning to my session. started me off strong, got my mouth ready for beer for the rest of the evening.  This is a very very drinkable IPA. I threw this into a mixed6 I got from Lucas. I regret that. I would have sat all night and enjoyed this beer that surprised me with its personality, balance and drinkability. This will definitely become one of my staples for session-type IPAs.

Taste of hops is good and is preceeded by slight malt taste, balanced but leaning more to the hop side, which is not a bad thing.  A good brew but not outstading. Hops do not flow together with the sweeter malt the is present as one might expect from a IPA with it's color and malt profile and tend to be more on the harsh end.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Brew33,3.08,"I had this in bottles a couple of years ago and wasn't impressed. I figured I'd try it again while available on tap.  It's a bit dark in color for an IPA but I like it. The aroma is all business, nothing but hops. The taste is bitter but not an enjoyable bitter. A resiny, sharp, dirty, bitter. The Hop prescence is pronounced throughout the beer but I don't like it nearly as much as most IPA's. I love IPA's but this is downright funky. Their bittering hops must be high in the AA department, wow.  It's okay but I won't be ordering it again. There are much better options available.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,OldYoda,3.63,"Pours a dark opaque amber into a Corsendonk goblet with a minimal head. An attractive brew.  Smell is subdued and primarily hops, but not as overpowering as some American IPA's.  Taste is very nice and a little surprising given the smell. It's hoppy and more hoppy and very dry. I just love it. It's right in my wheelhouse.  Mouthfeel is clean and dry - just what I'm looking for in an IPA.  Drinkability for me is fine.  An outstanding offering from Victory and one I can't think how I've overlooked. I'll certainly be back for more.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,BierFan,3.58,Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a Duvel tulip glass. Expiration date on the bottle of June 02 09.  Small light tan head and a dark orange body. Malty sweetness and grapefruit in the aroma. Whole mess of pine in the taste. More bitterness and pine flavors than I expected it to have. Really good though.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,ROBORB,3.9,"On tap, this beer poured a dark orange color with a nice 1 finger head. There was plenty of lacing. It had an aroma of hops, pine, citrus, and malts. I found that the taste matched the smell. The hops were not overpowering. They actually complemented the malts very nicely. The carbonation was very nice as well. This was a good beer but I felt that it was lacking something. I would seek it out again on tap as it is a great session beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

T: A little sweet to start, then the hops kick in.. thick and heavy... leaves a big aftertaste..  M: Maybe just a bit too carbonated for me..  D: Not one I am going to buy again. I have never been a fan of IPA's but I am always up for trying something new, and lately the 60 min and 90 min IPA's have been turning my head, so I figured I'd go for this one.. Just doesn't have the balance that I want..",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,markskar,4,"Pours nice orange color, heavy carbonation at first but little head retention, perhaps due to refrigerator set too cold. Chill haze. Nice hop aroma.  Tastes spicy, with a little bit of lemony fruitiness. Nice hop bite, but not overbearing. Moutfeel is very crisp, dry. Very drinkable, nice abv% for the style.

Head is about an inch thick and hangs around for a while, as does the lacing. Smells balanced between hops and malt. Noticable floral and citrus aromas. Tastes really good. Hoppy like an IPA should be. A definite citrus taste to it (grapefruit). A nice pine taste as well. Not a real strong hoppy bite, but plenty of hops in there. A nice bitterness rounds out the taste. Medium mouthfeel. A bit fizzy. A bit sticky. Leaves my teeth chomping for more. Goes down nice and easy. A very drinkable beer and quite enjoyable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,thekevlarkid,3.97,"Out of a bottle this beer was an orange-amber color with good clarity. The head was beige, rather small and didn't display very good retention and only spotty lacing. The aroma was excellent for the style, lots of herbal and citrus hops with a pale malt backbone. The flavors were at first notably bitter, with lots of orange rind and grapefruit notes, but behind that lurked the flavors of other hops clearly reflecting the multiple additions used. As it warmed I tasted more of the doughy malt along with some crystal malt and the herbal elements of hops that came through. Acidic and a little biting; great for hop heads. The body was medium, the carbonation very good and the mouthfeel soft and just a little oily. Distinctly bitter but sessionable and a good All-American example.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,AdmiralDiaz,3.17,"On-tap at Ed's (No Name) Bar  A: Pours a copper body with a one-finger slightly off-white head. The head has decent retention but only lacing from the head initial dissipation.  S: Smells very strong of hops with grapefruit peel and some caramel malt character.  T: Wow, very heavy on the hops. There's a strong hop character that gives way to a small amount of malty caramel which turns again into a sharp grapefruit peel finish with a bitter sting. It's not that I dislike a hoppy IPA, I actually usually love some of the unbalanced ones. For the Hopdevil it was just the flavor of the hops that I dislikeed.  Overall: Good mouthfeel, well carbonated with a bit of oiliness. Drinkability is a bit down for me due to the overwhelming unpleasant hop flavor which I personally found to be unappealing.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,JonMich13,4.42,"A = Nice copper amber, no head and no lacing.  S = Beautiful honey, floral, citrus, and malt medley that harmonizes perfectly.  T = Taste nearly mirrors the smell, only not quite as impressively, but outstanding nonetheless. Love the balance between the sweet malty beginning and the pine/citrus hops that slowly blossom through the middle and end.  M = Nice medium mouth with ample carbonation and not overwhelmingly lingering bitterness.  D = I find this very drinkable, both in its taste and mouth profile as well as its ABV.  Overall not a huge fan of the whacked out mega-hop beer craze, so I came in skeptical. However, I really enjoyed this beer. It seems the hops were added to a level that enhances the beer, not just to claim a high IBU to keep up with the Joneses. Well done brew!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,magine,4,"Poured the bottle into a Victory pint glass.  The beer pours a nice copper appearance with an off white head. The head fades after as you drink it but the lacing is nice and a tiny bit of head remains.  The smell is of hops an almost a citrus backbone - some floral.  The beer tastes very hoppy, but very balanced - I'm not a huge ""hop head"" but this beer is a good bang for your buck in the hops department. Detect some bitter floral flavoring. The beer almost sizzles the palate.  This beer is very drinkable, I am not a huge ""hop head"" as I stated before, but I could enjoy a few of these in a mixed case. I am not sure I would buy an entire case of it though. But for me I am not that into hoppy beers - they tend to have me burping all night.  I paired this beer with some chicken quesadillas, went great with the meal.

(another later smell reveals, pleasantly, something like the smell when you go into a bicycle store...new rubber tires?)  hoppy, bitter, slight malty flavor that isn't quite as complex as the nose (initially), but this is supreme stuff for sure. very well balanced, the maltiness finally asserts as it fades on the sides of the tongue. i would actually expect and like this to be creamier...chewier...yet, for it's crispness, it becomes that more drinkable...5.0 for most hopsters i imagine, but still, for all it's 'thinness' and moderately higher ABV, this isn't quite a session brew. it's got too much character to want to be slammed without being appreciated on a nice cool spring or fall day...  and yes, LEMONGRASS!  also, creaminess not noted earlier came forward as it warmed.  an A+ beer for sure",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

The smell is nice and hoppy, pine and citrus like a good little a ipa should be. There is a little malty backbone for the lupulus to lean on. The taste follows suit, with hops strong in the front, leading the way for a bit of malty alcohol finish. Very nice and well balanced. The mouthfeel is nice, my only complaint would be a bit overcarbonated. The bitterness is perfect, the body is definitely just right. The drinkability is very nice, I can toss back quite a few of these without my mouth feeling overwhelmed.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Very nice  T - Spicy hops that mellow down to a smooth malty taste as it slides down the tongue.  M - Not over carbonated. Smooth balance between the hops and malt flavors. The aftertaste picks up some spice and pine from the hops, but not overwhelming  D - The balance and lightness of this beer make it very very drinkable, not to mention refreshing.

345,1005,Sycodrummer,4.18,"Poured from the 12oz. bottle into a Duvel tulip the beer was a dirty penny copper with about two fingers of just off white fluffy head that retained very well throughout the whole sample and left a thick sheet of lacing. Lots of carbonation streaming up from the bottom and sides of the glass.  The nose smacks with hoppy aromas. Piney and citrusy, slight grapefruit, and an ever so soft bready malty aroma. Hop aromas dominate this one with pine cones coming through.  The first sip has carbonation grab the palate right away with a prickly impact that soon gives way to a dry bitterness on the back of the tounge. Taste mimics the smell as you not only sense the bitterness but also ""taste"" the hop aromas of pine and graperuit. The balance actually comes through as the beer rests for a moment. A semi-firm malt backbone is present and serves to cut through the hops just slightly. Hop flavor still dominates, but the beer is not without balance. I remember the beer being less balanced in the past. The finish is dry, crisp, and resony hops coming back through.  Medium body with a good amount a carbonation. Prickly, dry and crisp with each sip.  The beer has always been a solid and afforable choice for an IPA. I recall the beer being less balanced in the past; perhaps my affinity for hops has made even those beer which pack a punch seem less agressive than they once did. Either way, still an excelent beer that I return to often.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,PeprSprYoFace,4.25,Found out Victory is distributed by me now so I picked up a sizer of this and storm king.  Pours a cool looking red color with a nice looking head. Decent lacing but not a ton.  Smell is pretty hoppy but the hops smell nice. Kind of earthy smelling hops with a nice malt smell too.  Taste is great. It tastes sort of like a malty Irish red with IPA hops. I think it's very tasty. Glad I bought a 6er.  Mouthfeel is good. There is a sort of weird feeling in your mouth in the end but that kind of tastes like rye.  Overall I will buy fresh ones of this as long as I can get it.

Grassy hops, quite a bit of spicy prickliness in the back of the throat. Sweet caramel malts, very sweet.  M - Medium to heavy, quite chewy.  D - I don't particularly like the grassy, spicy hop profile here. Quite a bit of very sweet malts, not a very pleasant balance.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,brow1901,3.98,"A- Pours a clear golden red color, light cream colored head is large but dissipates rather quickly. A very thin layer of sticks around and leaves lacing all the way down the glass.  S- Mostly of malt, not heavily roasted malt but rather the fresh baked bread malt smell. I catch a slight whiff of some sort of spices maybe pepper. And definitely plenty of hops.  T- Taste is excellent, great balance of strong malts to hops. Some of the spices shine marvelously. The only thing I would ask for is a more defined hop character, something with a citrus or pine taste would seem a good fit. The hop character breaks away from the malty sweetness in the aftertaste.  D- The beer is incredibly drinkable, perfect light carbonation blends with the great taste to make a super smooth beer. Hopdevil goes down easy.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,PerzentRizen,4.24,Acquired in a trade with Pudge43 - I believe (lots of trading going on these days).  Upon first site I have to say that it looks fairly average. Really it has a much darker side than many IPA's - this is a ruddy brown color. The head is off white. Poured into a Duvel glass.  The aroma is of massive malt. It's almost like a mash tun with massive amounts of barley rolling around! This smells juicy.  The first taste confirms why this beer is called HopDevil. There is a very unique hop flavor. There is almost a component of tannin or acid that gives this beer a sour flavor - very good. I must say that this beer is extremely dry/attenuated. I really am loving this.  The mouthfeel is light despite the massive malt nose. It's great to get a chance to appreciate a regular IPA. I've been drinking so many Double IPA's that it's almost been too much. I do enjoy this one.  I would call this beer very drinkable. I would have no problem sitting through an afternoon of these. The hops are a bit over the top - but in a good way.

Sweet malt interplay with the hops with traces of brown sugary breads and buttery, syrupy pancakes.  T: Initially good bitterness in front, grapefruit and wet pine. Following are balancing malts baked quick breads. Muddled in with the malt and hop balance is an underlying spiciness, dry and peppery. At the end, there's decent residual bitterness, very piney and somewhat astringent.  M: Solid medium body, crisp, and leaves off slightly slick.

A slightly off-white head rises in as fine and pillowy and leaves just a touch of lace  S: Limited aroma, maybe just a very faint citrus  MF: Medium body with nice carbonation, but a bit dry feeling  T: The hops are astringent and biting, but quickly balanced by the malt. The hops flavors are indistinct due to the dominant biscuity malt.  D: I could probably drink more of these due to the malt backbone preventing undue palette crushingness, but it isn't what I look for in an IPA",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,BARFLYB,3.71,"12oz bottle into a regular kitchen glass. Have not had this in years.  A- Hop Devil pours out the standard copper/bronze color with bubbles seen rising to the top. This yielded an inch white foamy soapy looking head that left with the quickness. It did leave nice lacing though.  S- This IPA has a very faint hop scent with the traditional malt backing with the latter taking the lead. Not very pungent with some pine scents and a twinge of bitterness.  T- I get a bunch of sweet malts in the beginning but after time on the tounge the hop punch came through, although this punch was more like a push being not to dominate. Very light citrus flavors with some breadyness.  M- It really took some time in the mouth to get the full appeal of the hops used which was not much. After some time on the tounge the hops came through with slight bitterness. A step below medium bodied with good carb going for it.  D- A step above sessionable this devil is quite drinkable while not being to forward with any ingredient.

Not too bitter, not too strong. At 6.7% ABV it is a little on the low side for an IPA so the alcohol is well hidden.  A nice IPA, easy drinking and not too extreme.

Smells bitter with leafy hops and a rich bitter earthiness, and a touch of grainy sourness. The taste exhibits a nice deep bitterness and an earthy richness as well as a hoppy, creamy finish which is unique to the cask in my estimation.

Minutes after the intial pour, there's still a one inch frothy head and considerable lacing on the glass.

Stings the front of the tongue a bit, but very mellow overall. Nice sweetness on the finish, followed by a dry aftertaste.  Drinkability - Very drinkable IPA.

Holding the glass up to the setting sun coming in through my window shows the most wonderful amber colour with plenty of rising bubbles and a creamy white head. The head showing good retention and leaving a pleasing pattern of lacing on the inside of the glass.  Much citrus in the aroma, with a good hit of malty toffeeness. The hops are to the fore in the mouth but the malt is rounding things off in the background. The hops certainly do their fun little dance at the back of the mouth as it goes down though. Very satisfying in its balance. Perfect mouthfeel - not too full, not too thin, not too carbonated.  One of the best beers I've tried for a good while.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,adamks,4.45,"a: pours hazy copper/orange with a sticky, long-lasting, lacing one-finger head.  s: spicy hops, citrus, pine, hints of sweet malt buried under the hops.  t: hops up front, then the sweet malt with citrus notes, then swinging back to hops on the finish. great play between the malt and hops.  m: lighter body, medium carbonation, with that wonderful hoppy coating after you swallow.  d: great balance of malt/hops, still strong on hops but malty enough to drink multiples of. one of my favorite IPAs, this is one i should always have on hand.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,DoctorDog,3.65,"Thanks to beveritt for sharing this little devil.  Presentation: 12 oz bottle into a nonic. ""Enjoy by Mar 03 09"" stamped on front label.  A- Clear copper/amber. Pours with ~2 fingers of light tan head, which fades gradually to a thin cap, leaving ample lacing as consumed.  S- Spicy citrus hits the nose first, but seem to fade away quite quickly after pouring, and are replaced by a malty, herbal presence.  T- Sweet malty notes strike first, followed by a very tea-like flavor, and a fairly bitter, spicy finish.  M- Med/high carbonation. Crisp, smooth, and dry.  D- Decent, but I can see the dominating tea flavors getting overwhelming after a few of these.  Future outlook: Decent, but pretty run of the mill. With so many great drinks to be had, I won't seek this one out, other than to perhaps try again when extremely fresh.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,jonziefle,4.05,"Appearance: Poured a nice golden-reddish amber. One finger off-white head that shrinks down to a thin layer. Decent lacing down the glass  Smell: Very strong frangrance of fruity, ""juicy"" hops, pretty much all you can smell. Both citrus and floral hops in general, but grapefruit comes out the strongest the strongest.  Taste: Strong hoppy flavor (but not as much as you would think) with a good bite at the beginning that lingers a bit. Bitter like IPAs are, but well balanced with sweetness. The hops are never too much and fade just at the right time.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied beer and smooth drinking. Filling, but not too much.  Drinkability: Very nice IPA. A good balance between hops and sweetness makes this one easy to drink and very enjoyable. Definitely a keeper.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Stunner97,4.73,"Appearance- A good amber looking ale with a thick white foam head  Smell- Hops yeast and even a slight malty nose  Taste- A good mix of hops and malts, a bit bitter as expected with the hops but still amazingly well balanced, its a beer that is absolute perfection in balancing both extreme spicy hops and a smooth well balanced finish. The taste is amazing so well rounded and blended. Its an extremely hoppy beer that even with that is so well rounded  Mouthfeel- Soft delicious foamy with a slight carbonation, feels good but hard not to with such perfect flavor.  Drinkability- AMAZING, simply put amazing. A decent alcohol level but still so hidden in a perfectly balanced flavor. This is a beer I will seek again not occasionally but often. A great beer, too me damn near if not perfection.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,seanbhudson,3.7,APPEARANCE: Pours a hazy orange amber color with a large white head that dissipates slowly. Very long lasting lacing. AROMA: Sweet citrus (grapefruit) and pine. Hint of apricot and malt. TASTE: Earthy / piney hops. A hint of caramel and citrus. MOUTHFEEL: Medium bodied beer with a sticky texture. Fizzy carbonation. DRINKABILITY: There are a lot of hops in the beer but to me it is a bit one dimensional. I prefer a hoppy beer that is balanced with a little more sweetness.

345,1005,PhxHorn,3.68,"This is a medium orange color with a finger of head. Not as fluffy as Hop Wallap, but it leaves some lacing on the glass. Smells mildly of pine, citrus, and malt. Tastes mainly of malt and a hint of citrus, but leans more in the direction of an amber ale than an IPA. Carbonation is just about right, and overall this is a very drinkable beer. A little milder than most IPAs, with more amber characteristics than I expected, but still nothing to complain about.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,biker30x,4.7,"Poured from a bottle into a pint. Hazy golden-orange with a medium sticky head. Opening the bottle releases the full aroma of pine resin and grapefruit citrus, it intensifys through the pour. Nosing the glass reveals a slight vegital earthiness. The first sip hammers the mouth with hoppy spice which competes with a sweet side of citrus and burnt brown sugar. There is also a hint of yeasty rustic bread. Did I mention the deep pine burn of the hops? Crisp in the mouth, neither thin nor overly thick, the overall drinkability belies the 6.7abv. For an extreme hophead, this is a session beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,pandashaver,4.68,"A - Beautiful deep reddish brown hue that sets it apart from other IPAs. Head is nice and foamy but not massive, lasts a while but could be longer.  S - Very zesty floral spices.  T - Hoppy, but not as ridiculous as the name implies. The balance with smooth spice and some sweetness is tough to achieve. There is bitterness right up to the point of being almost edgy, but then it gets sweet and is smooth the whole way. Congrats.  M - Medium-bodied, sticks to the palate a good amount. You enjoy this one before, during, and after taking a sip.  D - Very drinkable due to the restrained, yet ever present, IPA hop character. Have had multiple times on draught and bottled. Will buy every now and then because it's ""menacingly delicious"".",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Cyberkedi,4.08,"Pours a cloudy dark amber, barely transparent, with a thick beige head. Decent aroma is hoppy and has evergreen and yeasty tones.

Texture is smooth and lively, leaving a satisfying finish.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,beveritt,3.92,"Presentation: Poured from a 12 oz brown bottle into an Imperial pint glass. Label depicts a hop cone, slightly altered to resemble the head of a devil or demon. Enjoy by Mar 03 09.  Appearance: Pours with a little over 1 finger of tan head. This settles to a thin coating of foam with some lacing left behind. The beer itself is a brilliant ruby copper and perfectly clear. No sediment in the bottle.  Smell: Caramel malt aroma with hints of hop spiciness and a melon like fruitiness.  Taste: Caramel malt, slightly sweet, blend swell into hop bitterness. Hops are spicy, with hints of pepper, yeast and wildflower honey. Lingering hop bitterness in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Higher than average carbonation level. Body is decent.  Drinkability: Finally starting to venture more into Victory's beers. This one a decent IPA, but given the name I would have expected more of an DIPA.

T: This is big on flavor, and flavor being hops. Some citrus involved, very piney, and nice earthy tones to follow through.  M: High on the gulp factor, some thickness, and a pleasant aftertaste make for a stellar session.  D: Very much so. A session beer for the hopheads is no question, until the ABV kicks you in the ass.

345,1005,FrothyBeverage,3.71,"This beer has a rich amber color and the artwork on the bottle of the hop devil was really awesome. Victory always has good artwork for the record. It has a tea like citrus aroma. The taste is of a very earthy hearty happy hop. ""I can taste the happiness more than anything"". It has a very smooth feeling rushing past my tounge and down my throat. Very minimal carbonation factor.

345,1005,bum732,4.35,"Pours an amber red color, nice fluffy head with lots o lacing. Smells of grapefruity citrus, fruity malt, pine. Tastes of pure cascade and pine from the cascade hops up front followed by a well rounded english like malty profile. Finishes with some nice bitterness and pretty sweet. Lots of grapefruit, pine, toffee like malt. Nice carbonation, i absolutely love the combo of the sweet malt with the hops here.  A fantastic IPA. I'm not a huge fan of east coast IPAs but this one hits the mark. The sweetness and fruitiness of the malt is countered perfectly by the fresh hop zing and aroma. My favorite east coast IPA so far, i love it!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Fredk24,4.4,"The best hop profile in a single IPA, bar none. I use this beer as a measuring stick for other IPAs. If I were to summarize the essence of HopDevil in one word, it would be ""balance"".  There is a decent amount of hop bitterness, but also much more of the floral, citrus hop notes that really balance things out.  Anyone can make a super bitter beer, just as anyone can paint on a canvas.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,tittymcj,3.27,"Drank this beer with my good friend William Pang (Queens, NY).  Poured a murky dark copper color with a medium off-white head and good lacing. Not much smell to report, but the little that is there is a fruity sweetness that says nothing of the hops in this beer. The taste is very similar to the smell. Not as much hops initially as I expected. Much more sweet malt flavor than hops at first, but eventually moves aside to reveal the hoppy bitterness I was promised. Thin mouthfeel, well carbonated, and definitely bitter on the tail end. Very dry finish. Not a great IPA, mostly because of the lack of stinging hop character. However, definitely a good beer that I could handle a few of in each sitting.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,TLove,3.92,"On tap at the Big Hunt in DC.  Nice, reddish ale color, well-laced head. Profoundly hoppy with a capital ""H"", but malty and sweet fruit component constructed to balance the graininess.  Despite popular opinion, not as overwhelmingly hoppy as it seems. The Stone Ruination IPA is far harsher in my book.  Big huevos. Big taste for the American IPA. Well-done for Victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,scootny,4.23,"The paradigm American IPA for me. Sizable head and clear reddish amber. Sticky lacing to adore as you drink. A nose of every hop pofile you would want. Big and piney huge grapefruit. It's all here. Believe it or not you can even smell a caramel malt base. Thankfully that base can be tasted as the hop parade hits you and tells you there is truth in labeling an Victory... at least the hop part. Nothing devilish here. The hops are upfront and everywhere. Grapefruit abounds and may be the signature of the profile but pine is not hiding. Earthy, spicy. Think of a hop descriptor and it is in my glass. There is a malt component. Just enough to hold this flower child together. I taste caramel and light yeast fruitiness. A good nutty component as well as a lingering toasted graininess. After that guess what? Finish is dry and short. Hops linger with a hint of latte like malt. Strong English tea leaf and hop bitterness stays around for days.  Feel is medium and light with a touch of creaminess in the carbonation. Good hop oiliness. Drinkability is hampered for me by the huge hop signature. Not a bad thing, just the hop bias slows you down. It's easier to power though a beer that displays more malt balance. This one is a hop showcase.  A great modern East Coast IPA. I love this stuff.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,TheDoorman,3.53,"Deep burnt orange color with a white head that dissipates rather quickly. A musty, earthy hop nose. A few sips and it hits me that I'm getting a strong dosage of aged cheese, maybe gouda, and maybe a little spoiled milk. A hint of smoke, though I may be confusing the aged cheese scent for smoke. Interestng, though not typical for an IPA. Not sure what to make of this so far. Taste is a little underwhelming up front. Hops are present in the palate, but don't match the smell in strength. Finsih finally brings the hops out the citrusy hop flavors, with a nice lingering bitterness. I am really a big hop head, so I tend to be rough of run-of-the-mill IPAs, that have just basic hoppiness. I'd put this beer in that category. Mouthfeel is light, with a little oily, creamy, texture. Decent IPA, but not the one for me. Not to worry, there are plenty of IPAs in the sea.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,gyllstromk,3.45,"Pours a cloudy amber with a rigorous, thick velvety head -- doesn't look much like your typical IPA, which should have tipped me off that something wasn't quite right. Nose is a dominating raw maltiness with the characteristic floral hops nearly absent. The taste does not add much complexity; very little hop bitterness follows. Where exactly is this hop devil hiding? Maybe I'm spoiled by the hop blasts I'm used to from the American IPAs, but this one just isn't done to style. Overall, a pleasant but one-dimensional beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Chelsea1905,4.12,"Poured from a 12 o bottle into a snifter  Nice amber colour, witha sticky caramel/amber head that dissapers soon, but leaves a good amount of lacing.  Smells sweet, caramel, light floral notes, a little malt, and then there are the hops. A little bit of something unknown in there too, a spice of some sort?  Tastes like it smells, but a great balance of hops and malt. Not like some IPA's that are super bitter that the hops are all you taste. Afterwards, there is the small wave of caramel too.  6.7% ABV, medium mouthfeel. Enjoyable",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,pokesbeerdude,4.15,"Picked up a six pack at Arctic Liquors in Steamboat CO, around $7 if I remember right.  A: Nice copper orange color with an off white head, about half an inch thick, reduced to a film, huge spots of lacing all around, somewhat cloudy, not a whole lot of bubble movement going on.  S: A lot less going on in the nose than I had hoped for, what I can pick up is a pretty solid malt backbone, caramel flavors pop out, and a definite hop characteristic that I can't quite place yet, citrusy, though, nothing overwhelming, nice balance in the nose. Almost soapy.  T: A lot more going on than in the nose of this beer, big time hop presence in the flavor, citrusy, and really makes me pucker, definite lingering bitterness, malt backbone is really pushed aside, some sweetness, but nothing extraordinary, this beer focuses on the hops.  M: Pretty thin, nice carbonation, dry finish, almost reminiscent of putting a piece of paper in my mouth, big time lingering bitterness. A little thin though, I was hoping for just a bit more thickness. Slight warmth from the alcohol.  D: For being so far into the hop spectrum this one is a nice beer to drink more than one, not the best hoppy IPA, but still a damn fine beer all around. I could easily drink three or four in one sitting.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,TMB0424,4.11,"on tap into pint glass.  Poured a deep burnt orange/mahogany body with amber hues around the edges. A large white head had great staying power and left tons of lacing on the glass. Really a great looking beer.  Aroma was of sharp hops, pine needles, and citrus. A tiny wave of breadiness in the background.  Tastes like it smells, basically, and it's damn good. The peachy, oily hops really attack you immediately. The hops are grassy and earthy and oily - just real good. Slight waves of peach, citrus, and biscuit balance against the hops so it's really well-balanced for such a hoppy brew.  Mouthfeel is slick and oily and goes down very smooth. Medium bodied, good carbonation. Leaves a wonderful bitter, hoppy finish. Very drinkable, downing a few pints in timely fashion would be no problem. Alcohol is very well masked. Great brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,gabeerfan,4.1,"Pours a slightly hazy deep orange-amber. Nice head that falls to an incomplete ring and whispy islands. Pretty hoppy aroma, as expected. Pine, grass and some citrus with toasted bready malts. Flavors of earthy, grassy, spicy hops with hints of citrus. Toasted bread and sweet iced tea try to balance against the hoppiness. This is a hop bomb, but it is fairly well balanced. Medium-bodied. Somewhat prickly carbonation and the hops contribute to a somewhat powdery, dry finish. Pretty drinkable. Lots of good flavors. A very good beer. There only a few better IPA's out there, this is definitely worth seeking out.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,CMW,3.83,"The beer pours a deep orange/amber color that is slightly hazy. A thick, rock, off-white head forms and retention is decent. There is a slight amount of lacing down the side of the glass. A medium level of carbonation is noticeable when I hold the glass up to the light.  The aroma is extremely clean. Bold hops mixed with some citrus fruits. There is a hint of malt in the distance, but overall clean and earthy and filled with hops. No surprises in the aroma and that is not a bad thing.  I am immediately surprised by the balance of flavors. While the hop flavor is dominant, the biscuity malt is also present. This is not your typical hop bomb where all you taste is pure hops. There is also a wave of citrus that washes through the mouth and helps add to the clean taste of the beer. Although the beer ranks at 6.7% abv., the alcohol is masked nicely.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Kadonny,4.3,"Poured from a tap into a standard pint glass.  A: A dark orange color with a nice one finger white head. Not much glass lacing from this bar poured tap.  S: Spicy earthy hops with a bready malt sweetness.  T: Spicy earthy bitter hops with flavors of pine, grass and some citrus. This is one balanced beer as the malt sweetness is very forward with bready grainy malt flavors. Bitterness is high upon the finish and it really leaves your tongue puckering.  M: Medium and sticky spicy with a huge bitter finish. No trace of alcohol.  D: High, these go down really smoothly and they are very enjoyable.  Overall I really enjoyed this on tap, much more so than in bottle. This is a beer that must be uber fresh to be at it's best. I got away from HopDevil for awhile, but when I come back to it the beer is as good as always. Very solid and drinkable IPA.  Update 12/28/2009. Purchased a super fresh keg for my home. Updated notes are as follows:  T: Remember, this keg is fresh! Flavors of spicy floral, earthy, citrus hops pound your mouth up front with the long grainy bready slightly caramel malt sweetness keeping the mouth puckering hops from completely taking over. The finish comes with a larger citrus orange peel flavor with some slight grapefruit and lasting bitterness you taste for a long time.  Overall this beer is best when fresh. Drinkability is off the charts as each one goes down better than the last one. Such a damn drinkable quality stellar IPA that shines when fresh. Don't drink those bottles with date codes almost expiring, get em fresh folks.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,fingerlaker,3.93,"I've had great hoppy beers. This one is far too simple. Still good, but too simple.  It's as if Victory forgot that a hoppy beer can also have flavor with the bittering. The hops are straightforward and bitter, nothing more.  Pouring out the beer is translucent orange and amber. Beautiful. The head is moderate and leaves little archepelagos of lacing. The head stays around for many minutes afterwards.  The smell is piney and strong. Mild alcohol scent wafts through.  Taste from this medium-body IPA is this- Little sweet malt then *BAM!* BITTER! No real citrus flavor or pine note, just overwhelming bitter. All I'm saying is that I've had nicer IPA's in my life.  I drank probably five tonight, and I was pretty happy after that, hahaha... It has 6.8% alcohol, so be careful with it on an empty stomach. Despite the bittering, it was easy to put many down in a short time period.

345,1005,Duhast500,3.85,Poured from the 12oz. bottle into a Dogfish Head pint glass.  The color is a clear orange/gold with a finger of foamy white and some thine lacing left on the glass.  The smell is pretty grassy at first with a floral aroma that is reminiscent of a spring day. There is a slight citrus aroma that is in the back behind some mossy aroma and some lemon peel poking out.  The taste is hoppy but not as aggressive at first. There is a bitterness that is building as grassier flavor hits first with a mellow lettuce-like flavor. Earthy tones hold in the middle before a sweetness comes in filled with a slight sugary citrus flavor. Nothing really stays long and before there really is an established character it turns another corner and goes in another direction.  The feel of this beer is medium bodied and has a smooth finish that is a bit spiky with some hop bitterness. There is a nice drinkable feel to this beer that is smoother than expected since the bitterness is muted.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,JRed,4.3,"Pours a transparent amber hue with bubbly white head that leaves a little lacing. Brew retains a sweet aroma of wet hops, bread notes, and some earthiness. HopDevil has one aggressive personality, rich in hit and run hop attack that builds to a crescendo while in the palate and then leaves the tongue refreshed with mild dryness. There's some spice with the bread crumbs also. Crisp smoothness in body and characterized by malty goodness throughout the drink. Highly drinkable session beer worth having all year around in the fridge.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Sweet nose of spices, cooking bread, mandarin orange, turns hoppier as it warms, deep but not especially penetrating feel. Full-bodied, bitter in spite of a softer underbelly, hops still outdistancing the malts, albeit some roasty notes appear at the end. Orange and white grapefruit citrus with fewer baking spices here. Suggestion of pine tar along with generalized herbaceousness. Carbonation goes a long way to making a whole glass drinkable. Intensely aggressive beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,TheFightfan1,4.25,pours a clear amber color with an off white heading. This brew is alive ladies and gents.Very nice carbonation and great lacing. Grapefruit is immediate up front with very dry citrusy hops. Taste is dry and bitter but not overpowering also a kind of nutty aftertaste. A highly recommended IPA.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Clydesdale,4.15,"A: A somewhat hazy orange-red with a decently-sized, creamy off-white head with good retention. Lacing is great.  S: Citric/grapefruit aromas are most prevalent. Some bready, biscuity malt sweetness as well. Some fruity and floral hints as well.  T: A big splash of hop bitterness up front, with a grapefruit/orange rind character. This fades into a strong, somewhat sweet floral hop flavor. A balancing dose of sweet, yeasty malt keeps this from being out of whack. Faint alcohol taste as well, but it's hidden pretty well.  M: Medium bodied and very creamy, with medium-light carbonation. Bitter, but not nearly as dry as many of its IPA brethren - an oily, somewhat slick feel that goes down easily.  D: Another fine offering from Victory. I like this one, but it just doesn't seem to add up to the sum of its parts. That's not to say it isn't a great beer, but it seems a bit more like an aggressively hopped English IPA. Not a bad thing, but not quite what I was expecting.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,thespaceman,4.27,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass:  Appearance: Dark orange in color, pours a beautiful head with decent lacing.  Smell: A thick backbone of maltiness combined with some residual hop flavor up front blends perfectly. This one smells a bit like some citric fruit paired with some biscuit like maltiness in the profile.  Taste: Hops are evenly displaced to the maltiness, I think without the malt tinge this beer would be overwhelming. Grapefruit, citrus elements and some dry hop spice are easily found upon first sip, finishing off with just enough robustness to keep it from being overbarring.  Mouthfeel: With any high hopped IPA, your going to get some good carbonation, the bitterness is well deserving, and the maltiness adds some extra pop to the overall finish in the beer.  Drinkability: This is a very drinkable IPA for 2 reasons, the obvious addition of good malt adds to the spark of this beer, it's not just some overly hopped brew that is going to burn the back of your throat, and the brew has some good characteristics taste wise to keep this beer interesting. An excellent interpretation of the IPA style and I will defintley look for more of this in the future.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Floral. Good alpha acid base here. Some malty notes in the background.  T - Early flavors are not all that defined. Bitter and biting - immediately puckers me up. Not as much hop flavor. Does start to develop some balance towards the end of the flavor. The after taste is very bitter, dry. Bitter forward beer for sure.  M - The beer is light to medium bodied. Lighter than I would have expected for this kind of beer. Leaves one heck of a thick oily film on the tongue. Little carbonation bite.  D - The bitterness is just a bit too strong to be a session beer. The ABV is on the higher side, but not to the point that I would find this hard to drink more than a few.

345,1005,DmanGTR,4.15,"Reviewed from notes 1/9/09  Appearance: This beer poured a deep, clear ruby red with a 1"" off-white head that left ample lacing in my tulip glass. Head retention was decent and supported by continuous streams of bubbling from the apex of the glass. Swirling left to regeneration of the head. Small bubbles create a decently creamy head. 4/5  Smell: Hops are definitely the forefront of the nose. A few layers of complexity starting with very citrusy and piny aromas. Pine resin and grapefruit dominate the bouquet, followed by a hint of earthiness and finally, a nice caramel and cereal backbone to support the floral activity. 4/5  Taste: The caramel and malt sweetness is more pronounced here and lends a stepping stone to the big hop presence. The fresh grapefruit and pine flavors explode on the palate but quickly fades to an herbal bitterness in the finish that melds with the caramel and mild robustness of the malt. Bittersweet finish and not too dry at all. 4.5/5  Mouthfeel: A moderate bodied beer that is well carbonated to smoothness. Carbonation dances on the palate but is not overdone. Pretty crisp. 3.5/5  Drinkability: Quite a good beer for everyday drinking. Considering the price, it's a delicious quaff that should be a staple in any hop lover's fridge. 4/5  Overall: This is a well made American IPA by Victory Brewing Company. Their interpretation works well to pair with many occasions and foods. A great IPA to enjoy while watching the game, with some barbeque, or for a quick hop fix!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Can also detect some spices as well.  T- This is a beer that is bitter from the time it enters your mouth to it's finish. VERY hoppy beer. Can definitely taste some spices as well.  M- Very hoppy beer with a very dry finish.  D- It's definitely extremely hoppy, but it is certainly very drinkable.  Overall a very solid IPA from Victory. Hoppier than I expected it to be. Very good beer though. Definitely recommend it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,reppertmr,3.88,"Poured into a pint glass.  Finger head with a small bit of lacing.  Smelled very heavy of hops.  Taste was full of hops, almost overpowering.  Offers a good mouthful.

D - Great.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,markaberrant,3.91,"A - coppery orange with some red hues, crystal clear, off-white creamy head, good retention and leaves a web of lacing.  S - hint of bready malt, grapefruit, sweet citrus, not overly powerful, but nice and clean  T - lots of grapefruit greets the tongue, and carries all the way through, bit of doughy malt at the end, enough sweetness to balance, lingering bitterness  M - oily hops to start give it some body, creamy in the mouth, med low carbonation, resinous dry finish, no alcohol  D - goes down easy, with lots of hoppy bitterness in the finish  Very tasty, the nose is not quite as powerful as it should, but plenty of bitterness to back it up. Seems pretty straight up, no crazy malt character or hop profile, but well done. Should satisfy most hopheads.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,hops4me,4.38,I can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet. This is a long time favorite of mine. I find it nicely balanced and bold at the same time. There is the malt sweetness and toasted grain aromas. This is countered with the grassy and pine smell from the hops. The taste is the same. Caramel sweetness and slight roastedness appear up front but this quickly takes a back seat. Stepping up are the hops. Spicy hops and earthy flavors from the hops take over in the aftertaste. The body is medium which is what you would expect from the style. This beer is a staple of sorts. Always easy to reach for when not sure what to get.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Durge,4,"A clear caramel color brew with a medium off-white head and fair lacing. The aroma is mild citrus hops with a firm yeasty malt base. The flavor is nice orange peel hops with a bit of malt blended in. A smooth mid-bodied beauty that is very drinkable. Pleasantly carbonated, just an overall agreeable choice with fair hops presence to appeal to most anyone that appreciates some bitterness to their beer. Recommended.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,coasterfreak75,4.08,"The pour was a dark orange bordering on red with a nice two finger head that quickly dissapated and left no lace on the glass.  The smell was hoppy up front with earthy undertones, slight citrus hidden but hops rule the nose.  The drink starts with a kick of mild hops followed by a citrus flavor and finishes with lingering hops. The finish was quite nice even though the hops linger they are not oily.  Not a bad beer at all. Really a good IPA to bring a newby in on, quite mild. I just didn't care for the earthy smell it carried with it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,yesferro,4.72,"Servingtype: bottle  Appearance: Dark golden fizzy goodnes  Smell: wow! Spicy citrus with extra spice, this beer has an excellent citrusy aroma  Taste: The hop flavor hits you right in the face but in a very gently and loving way, once again, citrusy, maybe some lychee and a slight bit of pepper  Mouthfeel, nothing devillish about it, goes down really smooth  Drinkability: very easy to drink  PS: I wish this beer was legal in MS",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Wackyfoot,4.77,"Dark amber pour with a medium sized off white head. The power is in the spices here, big spicy flavor right up front fading to a hoppy finish in the back end.

345,1005,thekanna,3.93,"Had at Teaism in Penn Quarter, Washington D.C.  Appearance: Nice bright orange copper with a thin layer of white foam to cap it off.  Smell: Clean and fresh. Slight citrus notes in the background; like well done dishes, but without the soap taste.  Taste: Wow, this is like a hop slap in the face. Rather, someone put hops in a cannon and shot you in the face with them. The characteristic flavor of hops (lychee, longan, a couple other tropical fruits...) is strong with this one. Bitter bite tops it off.  Overall: If you like the flavor of hops, this is the way to go. Nice, refreshing beer that can cut through practically anything. Like paint thinner... FOR YOUR MOUTH.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,BeanBone,4.5,"Appearance: A somewhat hazy burnt-orange body with a solid finger of off-white and bubbly head. Good lacing.  Aroma: Floral, spicy, and citrusy hops balanced by a brown-sugary malt body. A bit of booze is lurking around the edges.  Taste: Spicy, grapefruity hops dominate at first and are decently bitter. There's a solid biscuity, sweet, and nutty malt backbone bringing up the rear, well up to the challenge put forth by the hops. The booze is there, but stays in its place. Everything meshes well and is perfectly balanced.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with good carbonation and a somewhat dry finish.  Drinkability: Goes back easily enough given the style and alcohol content. A good session IPA.  Verdict: With a solid malt backbone balanced perfectly with brilliant hops, HopDevil is one of the best IPAs that I've tried yet. I'm very much looking forward to trying the other Victory offerings I can get my hands on here in Houston.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,WakeandBake,4.12,"A clear copper color pour.with a generous white head that receded slowly and left rings of lacing. The aroma was butter, caramel, citrus and pine with citrus being the most dominant fragrance.

S: The nose yielded bright citrus, light pine and dry grapefruit.  T: sweet and citrusy with pine with a dry flowery hopping. There was a huge, dry munich malt backbone and dry hopping in the middle of the palate. On the finish was dried grapefruit, dry flowers with a good carbonation bite. Overall a very nice, dry flowery hopping that coats the tongue with bittering success.  M: a medium fullness and creminess with a nice carbonation presence.  D: A great citrusy and dry flowery hopped ipa backed by an equally huge dry toasted munich backbone makes this a standout.

345,1005,biboergosum,3.91,"I brought home a bottle of this from a recent visit Stateside, due to its location of origin (never had a Pennsylvanian IPA before), and let's face it, the overtly pandering label art. Hey, it stood out from the multitude of IPAs available on the shelves during that particular shopping trip.  This beer pours a light, clear orange amber colour, with a few fingers of pillowy white head, which sticks around for more than a few minutes, and leaves a fair amount of soap bubble lacing around the glass. It smells faintly of grapefruit hops, and not much else, even as it warms. The taste starts with a grassy, flinty hop dryness, that moves to include more resinous pine bitterness, before washing over a thin caramel malt backbone to the lip-smackingly dry hop finish. The carbonation is understated, allowing the hops to remain the star of this show. The body is a wee bit less than full, but, for the style, I suppose it is just right. There is no noticeable warming from the elevated alcohol. For the strong, but not overpowering, hop goodness, and the smooth mouthfeel, this is quite a decently drinkable IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,ShaneBertou,4.55,"I had heard alot about this beer but hadn't tried it until today. I had always shied away because of the $10 price tag on a six-pack.  So when my boss took us out to lunch today, I jumped at the chance to try it on his dime. I'm glad I did! Smooth, tasty and definitely lives up to its name when it comes to hops!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,TexasPensFan,4.23,"Bought a sixer of this at the new specs in Galveston (thank god) poured into a pint glass.  I am a huge hophead so I was excited to try a new IPA from PA.  A: this beer pours a golden amber color with an inch of creamy white head that is long lasting and clings to the side of the glass. Lacing continued tip the end.  S: I immediately notice the spiciness. This is followed by a strong hoppy smell and just a hint of citrus fruits.  M: Lightly carbonated, very smooth yet light with a lot of complexity.  T: First thing you notice is the spiciness. It then gives way to the extreme hoppiness one would expect from a great IPA.  D: Unfortunately, I feel that this is a beer that you could order all night long. The question is would you want to do that to your liver. At 6.7% ABV, typical of a high end IPA, you could have more than your share before you know it. The alcohol sneaks up on you.  Overall, a great example of an excellent IPA and at $7-$8 a sixer much cheaper than some of it's fellow east coast brethen (60 minute IPA comes to mind). Will definitely purchase again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,LilBeerDoctor,3.32,"Reviewed on 7/10/08. On cask at Blind Tiger. Pours a cloudy brown with a bubbly white head. Aroma is very fruity with citrus hops lingering in the background. Also smells like red grape juice. Flavor is less fruity initially as the aroma with more hop bitterness. A very odd IPA- I got roasted malts, soda, apples, raisin, and alcohol. I've never had this beer before, but it seems that it's quite different on cask. Interesting and not really at all like an IPA. 7/3/7/3/14 (3.4/5)",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,yesyouam,4.28,"This IPA has a good, clear, amber body with an off-white head that has great endurance. The aroma is a whop of dry hops in the face-- floral and piny. It is medium-light on the tongue and slightly chalky from all the hops. The flavor is quite bitter and a bit top-heavy-- just the way I like an IPA! Splendid!

345,1005,hwwty4,4,"Thanks to Popkas for this one.  Poured a 12oz bottle into my Chimay chalice. This beer pours a slightly hazy, dark-amber honey. When poured, it produced a big 2 finger, white rocky head that left an ample amount of sticky lacing. The aroma has a pronounced citrus kick but doesn't really lend itself to the naming of any specific fruit. Also the malt backbone makes its presence known in the aroma. The flavor follows suit with a nice crisp grapefruit bite followed by a nice malty kick. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a light carbonation and leaves a nice resiny coating on the palate. This is a good IPA. Something I would love to try again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,danielharper,4.42,"Appearance: Transparent orange-red body, moderate white heat full of bubbles. Very slight effervescence. Head leaves significant lacing.  Smell: Very sweet, grapefruit-laced, with a strong citrus aroma. This is followed quickly by the refreshing scents of crisp white hops.  Taste: Now the hops are up front. Crisp floral hoppy flavor, followed by a mellow, sweet middle and a dry finish. Clean and refreshing. Despite the name and reputation, seems to be a pretty well-balanced IPA.  Mouthfeel: Moderate thickness, low carbonation, heavy with hops. Goes down clean and smooth.  Drinkability: A very nice IPA, well worth its reputation.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,ljbrisson,4,"Pours a hazy copper orange into my goblet, with a half-finger off-white head which quickly recedes to a spotty film over the body of the beer. Aroma is orange, citrus, piney hops, with malt detectable as well. Mouthfeel is slippery and a little oily, despite the medium carbonation. Taste is a good balance of malt and hops, pine, citrus, fruity sweetness, with definite sharpness in the finish. I do not know much about IPAs, but this is one of the better that I have had. Drinkability is moderate to high for me, although I am not a hop lover by any stretch.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,magictrokini,3.53,"Overrated. Pours clear brown with a minimal off-white head. Aroma is hoppy, but more malty than anything else. Kind of a prelude to the taste. The hops and malts were unbalanced, and both tended to take away from each other. This is an IPA for people who don't like strong, hoppy IPAs.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,plaid75,4.2,Poured a medium copper hue with a one finger foamy white head. There was good retention and lacing.  The smell featured a resinous citric and piney hop and not much else.  The taste was upfront raw spicy hops. Biting citrus and pine flavors dominated. Solid grainy malt as well.  The mouthfeel was toward the fuller side of the style.  Overall a tasty hop driven ale.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,dfolmste,4.2,"The lacing and head retention of this IPA was great. Taste was of pine and spice. I had this right around the holidays so the taste fit right in with the cold weather. Alcohol content was just right and obscured by the rounded flavor. Very easy to drink and quick for a buzz. It was a bit on the bitter side of course, so the more I drank, the more I wished I had a less hoppy beer to pace with. A good example of the style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,erikm25,4.13,A: Pours a deep and dark hazy amber coloring. The head is barely off white with a muted copper tone. Fluffy and massive with long lasting retention. Sheets of lacing around the glass that stayed in place like well tucked blankets all the way to the end.  S: Rich fresh flowers coupled with breaded oak and honey aromas. Earthy and grassy with perfumed undertones. More herbal then expected. Citrus balanced against caramel and tart candies. Rich. I found myself taking numerous sniffs.  T: Very well balanced and not overwhelming. Creamy and satisfying with textured tastes. Represented hops flavor with a splash of spices and a sweet roasted malt roundness. Grapefruits are coupled with subtle toasted ginger. Biscuity and slightly rye with hints of lemon. Not that bitter and the alcohol was well hidden. Even better as it warms.  M: Smooth and medium bodied with good carbonation.  D: Being more familiar with West Coast IPA's I thought this was a very solid and pleasurable effort. Easily drinkable. Wish I would have picked up more then just one. Acid King was the backdrop for this tasting.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Onenote81,3.58,"Pours a deep orange with a nice rocky white head resting on the top. Good retention and fair lacing/webbing. I take a whiff of this and the first thing I notice is a strong peppery spiciness to this. Some mild hops. Really is lacking in the scent dept. Nice hoppy bitterness coats the mouth with a hint of spiciness. This brew feels warm in my stomach. Crisp and clean. Not that bad, but almost too bitter.

345,1005,Ruslanchik,3.73,"Imperial pint from the tap was beautiful. A thick, foamy white head sat atop the dark amber beer. The head remained throughout and left ample lacing.  Aroma and flavor were slightly unbalanced in favor of hops. Hop character was very citrus, with strong grapefruit qualities. Flavor was strongly bitter with floral afternotes. Well-rounded IPA, but slightly more malt character would have benefited the overall impression.  As with any highly hopped beer, Hop Devil was a little oily, which helped the hop flavor to hang around a little bit.  I was definitely ready for a change of pace when this one was finished.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

The malt is a base on all of this that keeps things from getting out of hand. There is a bit of a heathery floral note as well  M: Smooth, light carbonation, dry  D: While not a session beer, I can certainly have a couple before my taste buds begin to give out.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Taste is very hoppy up front, spicy on the tip of the tongue. A little more malty on the midpallate. Finishes very spicy, with a long resinous finish.

A - Vibrant, slightly hazed tarnished orange with a fairly viscous pour and a thick but frail butter cream head that slowly diminishes to a thin veil atop the liquid. Head retention and lacing are both fair.  S - Summery, green hops -- juicy citrus like honeyed grapefruit. Dried hop pellets swirling in cold wort. Pretty straightforward and pleasing.  T - Lightly sweet with caramel maltiness that soon gives way to a spice-laden hoppiness and a spritz of alcohol. Really gets dry in the middle and end, and the aftertaste is green and slightly astringent.  M - Cohesive and substantive. Tingly without being tongue-numbing, and puffing in the mouth to a soapy froth. Swallow is a wash of suds that is lightly belly-filling from the carbonation.  D - A good AIPA, but to me, not the best showcase of the style. Could use a smidge more malt up front to give a better initial footing on the journey into bittnerness.

I love it, I'm a hop-head.  The taste is absolutly amazing. Satisfies all the hop cravings and more I didn't even know I had. It's a perfect blend of hops with a spicy kinda kick.

The brew smelled a little caramel and piney. I liked the balance between the slightly caramel malt and the earthy, piney, and slightly citrus hops. While it's certainly bitter, I find this very drinkable compared to some of the West Coast IPA's that just hit you over the head with a bunch of hops.

The flavor is fantastic though. It has a lot of spicy and citrus flavored hops as was expected from the name. It does not lack anything in malt flavor either.

345,1005,gcarl,4.45,"So far the best example of an American IPA I have found. One of the beers that I have been drinking for years and finally decided to give it the review it deserves.  Pours a pretty dark amber, fluffy white head. A nice strong fresh hop smell. A nice strong fresh citrus hop taste. Carbonation is perfect, drinkability is unmatched.  The Hopdevil tops the charts when it come to balancing the hops and malt that makes a good IPA great.  Try one, another IPA will never match the glory that is the Hopdevil!

345,1005,dukedevil0,3.63,"Picked up a 6-pack from Binny's in Lakeview.  A: Looks very nice. Pours a clear amber color with a white head that settles down to a fine layer at the top of the beer. Slight lacing left on the glass after drinking.  S: Floral, earth hop smell with citrus.  T: Similar to the smell, with some floral, earthy hops and citrus. Slightly sweet at first, but some bitterness kicks in for most of the gulp.  M: Good amount of carbonation, but very smooth feel in the mouth.  D: Slightly overly bitter and not quite enough sweet to make this as drinkable as I'd want. The alcohol isn't very noticeable so if someone likes the flavor a lot, then I bet they could throw back a few.  Overall I just wish there was a little more sweet and slightly less bitter to make it more enjoyable to me. Something I would drink occasionally, but probably not seek out to purchase.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Not a lot of bubbles S= some hints of flor hops, more earthy hops, a lot of grapefruit though T= very complex blend of hop bitterness that's not over powering lots of grapefruit in it and some orangy citrus M= a bitter dry end light with little carbonation D=high this beer does a good job of not making the hops overpowering despite the name.

345,1005,schellsbeer,4.31,"Ok then...  Bitter meet Sweet. This is incredible.  I have never tasted an IPA quite like this one. I would have to say fantastic. Just a sec....I need another sip.  Yeah... I wasn't imagining it. Bitter and Sweet all rolled into an incredible brew.  A - Good. Nice copper color. Pours cloudy and stays that way. Nice 1/2 inch head. White to orange white. Average looking. Come On...really, how to you rate appearance. It is all about what is to come. If it were up to me, the appearance would only be 10% and the mouthfeel would be 20% but that is just me.  S - Hops. Plain and Simple. What is more to expect. Excellent. Citrus Orange. Clean. A little pine needle action going on. I like it.  T - This is what gives this wonderful beer the high marks. The best that I have tasted from Victory. I will be picking up another one of these in the not too distant future. I have never had a Bitter and Sweet IPA before. Overall, very nice.  M - A little thicker than I like. Lite Fruit Syrup is how I would describe it. This is different than most IPAs but ok. Still, I will be drinking many more of these.  D - Heck yes. Just for the taste alone. No need to twist my arm. Fantastic.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,saradad,3.51,"Poured into a glass from a 12oz bottle. So this is my first experience with an IPA, the color is a beautiful dark amber with some visible carbonation under a light tan head that quickly fades to almost nothing. The nose is grapefruit. Period. So is the taste. Somewhere in there is a light malt, caramel maybe? Very faint but there nonetheless. The feel is rather thinner than I was expecting yet not bad. The drinkability is rather fair in my opinion, not something I'd run out for but it's pleasant enough that a coupla these aren't the worst thing that could happen to a person at the end of the workday.

345,1005,Morey,4,"Poured out of a bottle into my Sam Smith's pint glass this amber colored IPA produced a nice 3/4 inch head that settled to a nice lacing after a few minutes or so.  Smells of caramel and malts dominate the aroma of this beer reminding me more of an English style pale ale or bitter by smell. Not much citrus or pine in the nose like most IPA's.  Taste is somewhere between an IPA and a red/amber ale. You get a little bite from the hops, but it backs off rather quickly in my opinion allowing the fruit like flavors of a red ale to come rushing in.  Morey's Bottom Line: This is a great beer that I could drink several of during a football game or some other event. That being said, there are ALOT of IPA's out there, and this is good, but not my favorite.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,ectomorph,3.68,12oz bottle a bit past its' prime (Oct16)...  A - Dark copper with some rose hints. The patchy off white head shows off the lively carbonation.  S - Sweet and spicy with a little alcohol. Earthy/grassy.  T - Definitely a hop delivery vehicle. Complex malt base holds loads of bitterness and citrus bite. The wet grassy taste is what I love about IPA's. Warm.  M - Bigger bodied for an IPA and nice carbonation.  D - Low/medium to to the hops ripping your face off. :),Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,gciccarelli,4.32,"Poured into pint glass.  Appearance - Dark amber, copper color. Half finger white head goes away quickly. Minimal lacing left on glass.  Smell - As expected, very big, hoppy smell with a hint of malt background. Definite citrus background - perhaps grapefruit?  Taste - Big hop flavor, but not overpoweringly bitter. Backed up by slight citrus hints and malt background. Also bits of spice. Hoppy aftertaste lasts for quite a while.  Mouthfeel - Light, very crisp from carbonation. Leaves small amount of residue in mouth.  Drinkability - Easy to down, but bitterness could make it hard to drink a lot of them (just like any other hoppy beer).  Another excellent brew from Victory...still haven't found one from these guys that I don't love.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,tadowdaddy,3.83,"A - Very clear, dark copper color. Poured with about a 2 finger head, one of which remained. Nice lacing throughout the beer.  S - Very strong citrus smell with a very faint caramel malt scent.  T - Medium citrus hop flavor followed by strong caramel malts. Not over powering on the hops. Delicious hop and malt aftertaste that lasts quite some time. Lack of hops disappoints me.  M - Decently thick in the mouth. The citrus in this one makes my tongue tingle. I enjoy the aftertaste, as it is accompanied by an oily feeling that sticks around for quite a while.  D - I think it's pretty easy to drink, due to my love for stronger DIPA's. For an IPA though, it does leave me nice and warm feeling on the inside. We'll see how I'm doing after I have a couple more.

Tasted about the same as the scent, a very smooth and crisp hop taste with some good background citrus flavors. Small hop bite on the tongue as it finishes, with a decent aftertaste.. not the best. Drinkability is good and mouthfeel is good, a small zing on my tongue but nothing unexpected. Overall I like this IPA compared to most others.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Great over all beer a must try.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,TubaManJack,4.57,"An orange hue with a head of pale orange/amber tint. The nose is strongly hops,with a hop ""holiday spice"" note.  The flavor of at least two hops and mild malt notes.

S- The nose is a bit tight for me but there is definite grapefruit, and almost a munich malt note in there along with some biscuit.  T- Starts off with a very smooth maltiness with notes of biscuit and caramel then moves into a nice long dry finish.  M- This is smooth and the Alcohol is well hidden.  D- It's to bad this isn't 5%, as it'd be one hell of session beer. Regardless, this is very tasty.

Balanced, but not in a small way.  m: Good body and carbonation, the sweet aftertaste is a little distracting.  d: Used to be one of my favorites, this was my first one in long time.

I like the multidimensional hops and malt. Definitely citrus and floral notes coming from the hops, with sweet caramel malts.  Flavors follow suit. After drinking a lot of one-dimensional hop bombs from the NW, I appreciate the balance of malt and hops. While they're good, the flavors aren't mind-blowing to me, not quite bringing the intensity of the aromas. Mouthfeel is excellent, full bodied and creamy with a moderately long, dry, finish. Lots of bittering hops at the end.  If this beer was more easily found here in Portland, and a couple bucks cheaper it'd be standby for me, probably.

What a surprise, I smell hops first...but they are not overbearing, more like a light west coast grapefruit hoppyness. I can definitely identify a slightly sweet maltiness as well. A pretty complex little IPA here.  Yes, the malts are readily on display as well as the bitter, citrusy hops. Dont get me wrong, this is quite a hoppy beer, but there is more to it than just the alpha acids. Caramel and toasty malt flavors really impress.  A pretty damn good IPA, but not quite great.

Orangy-grapefruit crisp hop readily apparent with some sweet dinner roll hanging tough with it. The citrus and malt blend well here.  Ditto on the taste, which still showcases the hops but never lets them run away or hog the scene. Toffee and sweeter fruitiness sorta keep the citrus honest yet know their place here. That said, this hoppy treat is just an IBU away from true bitterness. Catching some yeast and an almost wheat spiciness in there that may not actually physically be there. Alcohol is incredibly masked for 6.7%.  I'm amazed at the balance. This is quite hoppy but somehow has a mild caramel sweetness; and neither detracts from drinkability, together or individually. Medium bodied with a lingering sweet floral finish.

The flavor is deeply malty, smooth and rich, with a sneaky blast of delicate floral hops that comes on the back end, along with a bite of bitterness.

There was a thin dirty khaki head that dissipated fairly quickly.  s: bitter hops and caramel malts were the most predominant with a bit of lemon citrus coming through and just a hint of roasted malts and herbal hops.  t: definitely hoppy. Bitter and oily hops balanced well by rich and caramel malts. Vanilla, oak, maple, and molasses played well with the herbal, pine, and citrus notes of the hops which dominated the flavor on the whole. Pleasant and well balanced, with a good malt character.  m: Smooth, creamy, a bit thick and oily. I was a bit surprised at the syrupy consistency, but the solid carbonation pulled it together. The bitter woody hop oil lingered a bit, while the thick and syrupy creaminess didn't quite wash anything away.  d: Not too bad, but nothing that blew me away. The usual strong hop vs. rich caramel malt battle that seems characteristic of most strong aIPAs. I was hoping for more character to really make this IPA pop.

Taste: Molasses and oak step up first. Toasty malts, citrus fruits, and a light hop kick also add to the mix. More malts than hops, and while I normally don't like that sort of imbalance, I love it here! Reminds me of a milder Oaked Arrogant Bastard. Mmmm...

After the warm up act by the smell, the taste continued in the same hop juice vein. Shudder inducing bitterness on the finish. The hops are rough and coarse and very bitter. Centennials? A little smoky and astringent.  Thick, juicy mouthfeel. Medium carbonation with soft bubble texture. Syrupy finish.  Clearly brewed by people who know what they're doing, it looks great and has a nice subtly crafted mouthfeel. Still, too much of a one-note IPA for me. Beats you over the head with the bitterness, would prefer more balance between hop flavor and sheer power. Don't really want another one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,elniko,4.24,"Poured from bottle into pint glass.  A: Deep amber reddish hue, half finger of head with lacing. Nice looking brew, I really liked the rich coloring.  S: Wonderful smelling brew, hints of citrus, pine, and hops. Exactly what I would expect an American IPA to smell like.  T & M: Needless to say this is one hoppy brew. Doesn't have the citrus notes in the taste as the Stone IPA does. I get some serious piney notes, the hops are the star in this beer. Malt balance is good to keep the hops from completely overwhelming.  D: Definitely drinkable, not my absolute favorite IPA but one that I would enjoy drinking again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Doomcifer,4.32,"Pours a ruddy, deep amber color with a nice beige, frothy head that retains very well. Good lacing. Smells of floral hops, juicy, fruity, sweet malts. Wonderful aroma. Flavor is very balanced and provides a great bitter kick in the finish. Flavors of grassy hops, an earthy spiciness, doughy malts, astringent aspirin-like bitterness, great balance between the sweet malts and bitter hop flavors. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, good carbonation, and finishes a bit dry. Very drinkable but will catch up to ya.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,mbrasi,3.7,"Pour amber golden with a nice white head. Aroma is nice citrus and sweet. Flavor somewhat dissapoints bitterness lingers too long. This beer should finish cleaner but it doesn't. I really don't understand how this IPA can be in the same league as Furious, AleSmith, and Two hearted. It still is very drinkable and a solid effort.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,brandoneast,4.51,"The Devil pours reddish with persimmon highlights and displays rocky foam crowning the lip. The aroma of fresh hops sits to the back while more grain and malt are mostly present - the fresher the brew the more revealing hop aroma. This brown bottle has an 'Enjoy By' date of October 22, 2008 that could explain the underwhelming aroma. The taste is absolutely perfect - caramel malt and piney/grapefruit hops whisk together then slide to a trailing bitterness that devilishly taunts repetition. This ale is silky, somewhat dry, and completely exquisite.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,mjryan,3.76,Copper coloured with a thick white head. Good lace and good retention. Aroma is mildly hoppy with a sweet grain character. Flavour is at first bitter then sweet with a citrus zest character followed again by an assertive bitterness. Mouthfell is medium as is the carbonation. I could easily drink several of these in a session. My only real critisism of this beer is its week aroma. I expect more hops in the nose from my IPAs. Otherwise a good beer.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

A little bit of citrus, like grapefruit. Very faint.  T: Nice, very sweet maltiness that hits right away. Sweet and very delicious. The hops kick in the back, take a little bit to hit but a good showing when it does. Hop oils hang out at the back of the tongue for a while, and leave a very pleasant aftertaste.  M: Good body. Has a slight slick oilyness to it, but it isn't bad.  O: The malt sweetness is delicious and it is taken over by a very good hop flavor. A very enjoyable beer, one of the better IPAs I've had.

I love this beer on tap and bottle, but from a cask it is a totally different experience. The hops finish so clean and fresh at the end in a more subtle way, not as overpowering from a bottle. Tea/citrus flavors come through on the nose and 1st taste. Very balanced and easy drinking, could drink this all night.

Appearance is a rusty-hued coppery color with a full two fingers of off-white foamy head that slowly fell into one of the thickest rings of lace that coats the top. Sticky as well, leaves it's markings along the glass as you drink. Aroma is sweet, floral hoppiness and caramel malt notes,grapefruit present as well. Taste is a great balancing act of huge sweet and bitter citrus hoppiness back and forth with a great malty backbone, finishes out with a lightly dry and bitter afterstaste. Mouthfeel is slick and washes down easy, leaving a light coating in the back of your mouth. Medium bodied with light carbonation. Drinkability is great, especially considering the a slightly higher (near 7% abv) abv that is perfectly hidden, nice level of enjoyable complexity without being overwhelming.

345,1005,PatronWizard,4,"I was at the liqour store and this bottle looked at me and say ""Hey, I'm Hopdevil."" 'Nuff said. We went home together.  Dark amber orange. Wife messed up the pour. She usually does great so I'm not mad. Much. Tiny little head. Second pour results in a much better head (daddy poured).  The hop scent is surprisingly subdued. I mean it's called hopdevil. Smells more like a hop-lower-level-demon.  Taste is a little more than moderately hoppy, but it isn't blowing my ears off. I'm a big fan of Ruination or even Hop-15 and here's my gripe: if you use the word hop in the name, it better be some HOPPY ass shit!  OK, I'm done bitching. This is still a solid brew, it is hoppy enough and I guess I'm not judging it's name after all.  Overall: good tasty stuff, worth your time",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,itcomesnpints,3.65,"Tangerine colored and completely translucent. Unfortunately very little lacing or head retention. Smell is a little subpar for an IPA, though traces of peach, grapefruit and malt can be detected. The taste is a faraway battle between the undermanned hops and the bolder carmel malt that is the victor in this uneven match over the IPA. Although smooth taste, overall its not the outcome that I would prefer. Mouthfeel is quite balanced, but maybe a bit under-carbonated. Easy to drink, but nothing really unique or interesting here to talk about. Too many other superior IPAs out there that will prevent me from buying this again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Nice smooth hop aroma, and malts coming through as well. Strong hop flavor, more than lets on from the aroma. A good malt backbone as well. Smooth drinker. Malty, hoppy, overall. Very good. Went well with rosemary chicken.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,cnally,3.85,"The HopDevil Ale from Victory. Not always available easily in Indiana, so welcome, HopDevil.  The look of this IPA is a mean reddish-amber. There is a nice lightly colored powdery head.  There are some sweet and sugary aromas in the smell, but the big impact scent is the hops. They are the first and last thing you sense, but there are some fruity aromas if you dig deep enough, for instance, grape and apple.  HUGE HUGE hops punch. The taste of hops smacks you hard, and then subsides into an aftertaste much mellowed with the hop kick. This is an oaky and woodsy flavor, but almost entirely overpowered with the hops.  This beer, I will admit, is extremely dry and unforgiving. The feel is perfect, light and lowly carbonated, but the dryness is really impactful.  This is an easy repeat beer if you like dry IPA's. I am not the biggest fan of that style. However, it is a good representation of this style and very flavorful.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,jkrich,4.4,"12 oz. bottle with a drink by date clearly stamped on the label. The smiling ""hopdevil"" looks benign as if inviting you to enjoy the contents. The ale poured a deep, clear copper; almost red in color with a quickly diminshing white head. Some lacing on the glass rounds out the attractive look of this ale.  When you remove the cap, the strong, spicy aroma of hops is unmistakable; the aroma is almost coarse or harsh foreshadowing a hop bomb explosion in the mouth.  Unexpectantly, the first sip reveals a restrained malty character, but the bitterness of the hops lingers on the tongue and the back of the throat only to recede leaving again a spicy, malty flavor in the mouth. This one tastes similar to a highly hopped ESB with the subtle sweet caramel notes. The flavors hold up well as the ale warms in the pint glass.  A solid medium bodied ale with low carbonation; perfect for an ale. It coats the mouth with a complex, well rounded flavor of sweet malts and hop bitterness.  At 6.7 ABV, this ale is dangerously drinkable; the alcohol contents hides well. This is my third beer from Victory, and like the other two, I am not disappointed.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,micahgoldfus,4.65,"Poured a orange-brown color with red tints, and a cream-colored head that bubbled down fairly slowly. The smell was strong and quite pleasant: earthy, hoppy punch, with plenty of pine flavor, but a dash of sweetness. It was complex and complimentary, and the taste proved to be so as well. The taste had massive amounts of hop power, as you can imagine. It was fresh, and perfectly combined the floral, sweeter hops with grassy, bitter ones. Also, the are sharp citrus flavors as well, like grapefruit and orange. There was a sweet, caramel-like malt base that was simply perfect: not too sweet, not too bready, just right. The drinkability is fantastic: it's so hoppy it's spicey, so I couldn't drink it too quickly, but it still goes down smooth and easy, with the the other flavors coming in. All in all, a great beer that is powerful without being too over-the-top, as I find many American IPAs.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

T: Nice sweet pink grapefruit flavor made even sweeter by the caramel malt. Not cloying - enjoyable! Hops taste great. Grapefruit lingers in the aftertaste, along with some hops, but not much.  M: Non-astringent, medium-light bodied, a little oily. Carbonation perfect.  D: Goes down smoother than many of this style. I will be buying this again to drink often.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,kinger,4.03,"I have slowly become a hop head and this IPA definitely asserts my new found love for a great style. It's amazing that the amount of hop flavors present in this fine brew find a way to meld and flow ever so gently. I poured this into a standard pint glass and a rather nice burnt orange copper color produced a nice white head. Crazy amounts of lacing creates a spiderweb effect down the glass. Aroma is bursting with bitter and citrus hops, euphoria tickles my senses from scent alone. As I drink this I take bigger swigs and am rewarded with a refreshing sensation. A full malt presence is recognizable but it just can't compete with the generous portion of hops added to this ale. Outstanding flavor it flows so well and it is coupled with a rich full mouthfeel that slides into a satisfying finish.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

I'm not a hophead by nature, but I was eager to try this. Nice amber color, with a decent head (though is didn't last long). Definite, citrus-like hops in the nose and in the initial taste; but the flavor balanced out nicely with a smooth malt flavor and then ended with a great hops bitterness that left your mouth watering for more.

Head retention for about half of your drinking time with nice lacing from rim to the bottom of the glass.  Nice hop & malt aroma with this brew... much like a traditional English IPA. Very dense earthy overtones here.  Great hop flavor from the start which trails out to a stong malt finish. Real whole flower hops and German malts contribute to this I'm sure!!!  Very smooth in the mouth as it goes down.  I could drink this beer all night long and not get tired of it.

Aroma is nice and hoppy. Good notes of pine, as well as a bready pilsner like malt.  Taste is pretty nice. A nice bitter piney hop profile up front with a very balanced bready malt finish.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with ample carbonation.  Drinkability is fairly high. Beer is quite sessionalbe, and flavors are quite good. Easy drinking, just much more balanced than many other IPA's.

345,1005,jjboesen,4.6,"My review is based on a bottle quaffed in the intimate recessess of Birreria Paridiso in Georgetown (DC) and succeeded several fine beers.  Let's talk about the head; it was thick and foamy and sank like a deflating pillow atop a translucent copper-colored liquid of pure clarity housing a steady stream of carbonation bubbles. Lacing was minimal.  And the nose? Well, I detected a heavy floral blast concealing some hint of banana - which appears to increase if allowed to sit and if stirred several times. I love science.  Taste? Let the bottle speak for itsef: ""bold and spicy."" Labels never lie. In addition, there is a heavy layer of hops lathered onto the tongue, with the spicy bits fading into a semi-sweet aftertaste.  This very full-bodied; yet, not one with particular heaviness nor one that neccessarily overwhelms the palate. Obviously, this depends on one's individual hop tolerance level.  In any case,Victory does it again! Hop Devil is a superb ale with a well-balanced body and accompanied by a nicely palatable sweetness with a welcoming biscuity finish. Ahhhh....  To summarize, let us borrow from the Book of Stewie Griffith and simply say, ""Victory is mine...! Now where is that insidious harridan Lois?",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Reagan1984,3.76,"Bottle showed a ""best before"" of 9/30/08 I poured this from the bottle into a classic pint glass. There was a foamy two finger head that had quite a bit of structure and remained on the scene for quite some time. Beer was fairly dark amber with very little carbonation showing. Also very clear.  Aroma was frankly a bit more caramel and roasted malt than I remember. I've certainly enjoyed this beer many times before but this is my first time having one under the guise of reviewing it. There certainly was a light citrus/hop aroma but nothing that reached out and grabbed you. Have I been tainted recently by some of the market's big hop bombs? (This is the only beer, let alone IPA I've had today, so no palette contamination)  Flavor was very nice and quite balanced and consistent. The Citrus/grapefruit notes were evident. Didn't really notice any pine notes at all. A nice malt background was present throughout the flavor profile. Caramel like with some roasted tones. Finishes with a nice but fairly subtle hop linger. Malt is definitely more prevalent than I remember.  Medium in body this very drinkable and very smooth due to very low carbonation.  Obviously another nice beer from Victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,morebeergood,3.87,"I was surprised to see this on the beer list at a local Thai restaurant, so I ordered one. Poured from a bottle in a pint glass. Slight thin head, some lacing. Nice golden color. Lots of hops in the smell. First sip was a hop roller-coaster. Lots of hops hit the mouth, then it slowly fades in the swallow. For a hoppy beer, it's not as noticeable as other beers in the genre. Oh, the hops are there, but it doesn't overpower the beer. A nice blend of hoppiness and drinkability. This is one of the better beers that I'd order because it goes perfectly with a nice curry dish we had.

Good looking ring of lace with some small bubbles in the center.  S- Smells like my last Victory brew. Hard to explain but to me smells like a piney bitter cinnamon with some underlying sweetness.  T- Taste is superb. full of various hop flavors and other subtle notes like pine and lemon  M- Feels somewhat viscous like a quality beer should- refreshing but not so watery that you can't taste it.

Aromas of citrus like grapefruit, some orange, and biscuity malt.  Flavors back up the aroma quite well. However, the hops in the aroma seem weak in comparison to the actual taste. This one's bursting with grapefruity hops. Some pine in there as well. There are also biscuity malt tones coming through, but they end up drowned out by the hops. A bit of alcohol towards the end but it doesn't really detract.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Very smooth and creamy.  Wow, this is a great IPA.

Somehwat sweet smelling too. Tastes hoppy and smooth, a nice green grass hop. Biscuity, bready malt backbone. Fusel alcohol on the finish. A bit surprising, as the flavors don't come together all that well. Bitterness lingers, along with a ghost of lemon juice. Medium bodied, a little heavy for the flavor. Well, I must say that im underwhelmed. It's ok, but its a lot messier of a beer than I prefer. Yeah, there are lots of hops, but its just not particularly balanced.

Pours a rich golden-burgundy with an off-white head that rises and slowly falls to a solid film that laces all down the glass. It smells of piney citrus, but not in the same fresh biting way that a lot of IPA's come off. This one has more of a mellow and rich smell that rides atop a grainy backbone. The taste is more of the same. The hops are first and foremost, but there is a complexity here that leaves you looking forward to the next as soon as you finish the first. The malts provide just the right amount of balance in the sense that the scales are definitely tipped to the hops, but they bring their malty friend along to mellow out the finish with an earthy graininess that provides the perfect yang for their yin. Great beer, enough said.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Citrusy hops rise to the nose, but not as striking as I would have imagined with a name like ""Hopdevil"". Behind the hop start is some tea, orange peel, sour grapes and sweet bread. The hoppiness is kept in check by a certain malty sweetness that makes it go down somewhat smoother than expected. Carbonation is adequate in this medium-bodied brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

The nose on the beer has a fruity yeasty smell with hints of some fruity malts. Not much hops, but a slight bit can be smelled.  The beer has a very fruity malty flavour to it, with a huge bitterness from the hops. This is a quite unique IPA to me because of the hopiness being more bitter and less aromatic. The bitterness in this beer is just awesome, it's a nice change up from all of the aroma hopped beers. The mouthfeel is creamy with a bit of carbonation. The bitterness makes this beer drinkable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

It pours a tawny ruby color with lots of creamy off white head, tons of lacing, and lots of retention.  The aroma ... hops, and lots of them. There are some sweet malts present, some leafy, oily, and estery hop in the nose, and this is pretty much what you'll experience in the taste.  The taste is just very creamy malt, lots of bready and biscuity grains, sweet malts in the backbone, and plenty of juicy hops. This is a hearty beer by any standard. This has a British creamy maltiness that I definitely appreciate.  The consistency is quite heavy and creamy, very smooth, quite resinous on the tongue. The hops leave an oily feel in the aftertaste. This beer is slightly drying in the finish, but the aftertaste is quite light. The ABV is about right, there is a bit more warming alcohol notes in the beer than your typical IPA.

The aroma is nice and hoppy and the taste is as well. There is a lot of citrus and spice but what really stands out for me is the orange flavors. It reminds me of orange blossoms, actually! Well balanced too - not overly hoppy or bitter like some american IPAs.  Mouthfeel is appropriate for an india pale and it's got drinkability because it doesn't crush your taste buds with hops.  Probably one of Victory's best year-round brews.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,marcobrau,3.74,"Pours amber to red in color with an off-white head that has some staying power. Some lace is left behind as the head falls adding to the appearance. Muted fruity hop aroma; this must be an older bottle. Hop flavor is still fairly bright. Bitterness is somewhat less than I expected or remembered from a previous tasting. Mouthfeel is about right; slightly full. There's a bit of tannin from somewhere that dries out the tongue a bit. The hop flavor is rather interesting...I can't quite place it, but I'm going with grapefruit and it's a fairly strong flavor. There's a candy-like sweetness there, too, no doubt from the caramel malts that also give the beer it's color. By the time I'm half way through this beer there's rings of Brussels lace left behind. Nice. The aroma has opened up a bit and is a touch perfume or talc like; or dusty. Finish is a bit quick, at least in terms of bitterness, but hoppiness lingers. This is a good beer, but almost a pale ale by contemporary hop head standards.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Some earthy hops and some malt.  T. Absolutely splendid. Alot going on here as well. Floral hops in the forefront with a caramel malt backbone that is very delicious. Despite being an IPA, this is not overly hoppy. Very well balanced indeed.  M. Medium bodied, perfect level of carbonation. Smooth and delightful to the palate.  D. Very drinkable despite the high ABV. Cheers!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,eandolina,4.15,"I am yet to have a product from Victory that I didn't like--at least to some degree. The Hop Devil Ale is certainly no exception. Although the hops were a little subtle and less pronounced than I would have liked; I would definitely recommend this beer to friends. It is also attractively priced.  It had an excellent pour and very good head retention. The mouth feel and drinkability were also right on par. The alcohol level and purchase price make this a beer that can be enjoyed regularly and in large quantities.  The hop rate however is where this brew stumbles a bit. With a name like Hop Devil, I expected it to be aggressively hopped and to have a profound hop presence; this is where this beer fell a little short.  All things considered, this is a fine beer, and I would without doubt recommend this to fellow enthusiasts.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Appearance is a golden amber color with a fluffy, 2 finger light beige head that fell away quickly. The aroma was fresh and citrusy, with some grassy and lemon notes in there. The taste was brisk hoppiness, in keeping with the style, with a lingering sourness.

The head dissipated slowly, leaving lots of lacing around the glass. Aromas of hops, sweet malts, and more hops.  Taste is more hops, just like the aroma. Lots of piny and citrus hops. Slight caramel taste. Very bitter finish. Not overly hoppy, but good for an IPA.  Feel is slightly thick, with a medium-full body and slightly high carbonation. Doesn't leave any stickiness in the mouth though, it's pretty clean. Drinkability is alright.

There is some faint hints of apple, pear and a hint of melon.  The flavor is also a bit thin. This is a far cry from what I remembered this beer to be. This beer ought to be called Hop Angel but, that's to angelic. This beer is decent not more.  It feels thin for an IPA. Reminds me of a basic IPA. Surpiring.

Decent off-white head has some resiliency, and laces the glass nicely.  The smell is sweet and earthy. There is a sweet grain aroma, and virtually none of the pine and citrus smell of most hopped up IPAs.  Taste is quite good. A blend of caramel and sweet bread flavors up front, with a mildly bitter finish.  Mouthfeel is full-bodied, slightly cloying and dry.  A drinkable IPA, more in the British style than some. Not over the top on hops, despite the name. I'd have it again, but probably not at $12 a six pack.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

The head leaves a bit of wispy lace as it descends into a ring.  Smell: Earth, pine, grapefruit and caramel with some herbal notes. Unusual for the style but very nice.  Taste & mouthfeel: Juicy grapefruit, pine and bitter herbs with an earthy malt backbone. This is drier than the nose implies; sweetness is low, serving as more of a subtle undertone than a balancing element. The finish brings out a deep resiny hop flavor, though bitterness never becomes overwhelming.  Notes: Got this one from dyan - thanks! I've had this several times in the past but never fresh. Until now, that is.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

The hops are certainly there, as you'll notice with your nose and your taste buds, but they are not overwhelming or in your face like other IPAs.  Most impressive for me was the drinkability. I am becoming a big fan of very hoppy beers, but I find that this one strikes the perfect balance. Usually I will drink a very hoppy beer and be content for the evening, but this is one that I crave multiple of, and will definitely seek it out to have some stock on hand.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

There is a small nuance of toasted malt as well as a small bread like smell. Very good.  T/M-Great balance! By the smell, I thought the hops were going to be overpowering. This has a perfect balance of hops and malts. Starts semi-sweet then the hops take over, but not overwhelming. Has a nice dry finish that is just about perfect. The carbonation is right on for the style.  Overall this beer is great. If you are trying to like a more hoppy beer, give this one a try.

Taste: Not as hoppy as the smell indicated. infact its over ballanced just enough not to be extreme.

Nose is a bit muted, but I smell some caramel malt and some floral and citrus hops.  Taste starts off bitter, but is quickly balanced with some bready malts.

S - Lots of piney/earthy hops with citrus in the background. Slightly sweet malt aroma.  T - A quick burst of citrus hops loaded with floral components start the taste off, but it dies suddenly into a mouth-numbing bitterness. Mid and late palate are completely dominated by bitterness with no trace of malt character. This brew's only flavor is the early onset of hops.  M - Thin to medium and fairly carbonated. Pretty much like any IPA.  D - It's not undrinkable, but I doubt I'd ever session this stuff.

Smells of hops and, surprisingly, a nice maltiness not normally found in high-hop ales.  There is a smooth malty flavor to the brew as well, with a nice (if understated) hop kick. It has an almost buttery taste to it, along with an overall vegetal character.  The carbonation is maintained and wet hoppiness leaves a lingering, but not overpowering, bite in the mouth.  Much different from other American IPAs, much smoother. Leaves the option to drink more than one without being overloaded by bitterness. Detractors will claim bitterness is the point of an IPA, and not enjoy the malty character of this brew as much.

345,1005,Ben4881,4.27,"Victory HopDevil Ale Victory Brewing Co.  Appearance: This beer pours hazy amber with a barely-off-white head that dissipates quickly leaving sticky, spotty lace. As the beer drains, all the lace succumbs to gravity and rejoins the brew at the bottom.  Smell: Certainly smells like hops, but not an overwhelming punch. There is some sweet malt smell in the background as well, but mainly hops and not all that strong. After a taste, however, the organic, plant-like hop aroma is much more prevalent.  Taste: What the hops lack in odor, they make up in taste. From the very beginning, the hop flavor tickles the front of my tongue. Then, the sticky, oily, bitterness hits the back of my tongue. The aftertaste is a dry and fiery hop flavor worthy of the name HopDevil. Then, the aftertaste slowly transitions into something subtly warm and piney.  Mouthfeel: As the hazy appearance would indicate, this beer has some body to it. It is thick, but not chewy. For me, the carbonation level is adequate and appropriate. I can feel bubbles dancing on my tongue, but they do not take much away from the taste.  Drinkability: I could definitely find a groove with this beer. The body is just right and my tongue is not completely body slammed by the hops. It has the perfect combination to drink more than one in a session.

Notes: Tried this on the fly,simply going by the reputation of Victory. No regrets and I was ready for the hop assault and sure enough I was not disappointed. I will buy more and share some with my hop addicted friends. Although this may not be a session beer one can have a few and simply enjoy with friends.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,dnichols,4.23,I keep insisting that I am not a fan of AIPAs but then a brew like this one comes along and presents a case for this style that I find hard to ignore. I poured a 12 ounce bottle into a Sam Adams lager glass.  A: It poured a richly dark orange with a one finger white head that receded to a skim across the surface and ring around the collar. There was a thin and leggy and clung to the side of the glass.  S: The aromas were bold and complex with floral and citrusy hops balanced well with sweet toasted malts.  T: The sweet and creamy malts were challenged by a range of hop flavors that gave the tongue a real workout. There were earthy and citrusy (grapefruit and oranges) flavors. On the backside there was a sweet tart like presence that made the finish of each swig entertaining and left me wanting more.  M: It had a medium-body with a modest amount of carbonation and a great refreshing finish. There was a bit of bitter-sweet aftertaste.  D: It is a great IPA with a wonderful flavor and complex aroma. I would be limited to 2 or 3 before the bitterness overcame my enjoyment but its a great way to go.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,hyland24,2.92,Poured from a bottle into a tall pilsner. The beer poured a clear amber red with a nice looking 2 inch off white fluffy foam head leaving rings of lacing behind after each sip. The smell was impressive with strong piney hops jumping out of the glass followed by a faint hop smell. Full flavored with bitter hop spice bite followed by a not so pleasant tinny metallic taste. The beer finishes even more bitter than it begins. The beer was well carbonated leaving behind a slick piney feel. Sorry to say a was a bit disappointed by this one. Looked forward to it after all the good reviews but was not blown away. Unfortunately I think Troegs has set the bar a little too high with Nugget and even Hopback Amber. All the other hop selections have fallen short. Worth trying but not what its hyped up to be.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,IronCitySteve,4.25,"I absolutely love this beer. One of my favorites.  A: A very dark amber, with a tint of red. Has a lacey off-white foam.  S: Citrus, a hint of grass and some spice flavors are the most noticeable  T: Nicely balanced beer, a good burnt malt taste  M: Medium body beer, a slick oilness  D: Easy to drink but a little higher ABV so I take these a lot slower",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

I must toast Victory for getting their beer into the ballpark and the ballpark serving it cleanly and well, even in a plastic cup...  The grapefruity floral piney hoppy aromas and flavors stand up well to outdoor drinking as Phillies fans curse out Mets fans all around me...refreshing and deliciously drinkable...can't go wrong with this super-full flavored beer with a long, bitter finish.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

A nice interplay. T-Citrus, faint spice, roasted malts, orange notes, pink grapefruit, and a nice bitter-hops aftertaste that cleanses the palate and inspires frequent subsequent drinks. M-This IPA is very well-balanced, and the carbonation is just right. D-Highly drinkable. Too strong for a session, but I would share a sixer any day.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,MSchae1017,3.85,"This beer was tasted in a pint glass from the bottle.  This beer poured an amber golden color with a big off white head that leaves a nice film the whole way down and laces nicely. The smell is a fantastic combination of citrus (grapefruit) flavors from the hops along with some maltiness that seems to give the beer a mild dark berry fruit aroma. The flavor has a one dimensional hop characteristic with some bitter, astringent, and metallic flavors. The mouthfeel on this one is good. Nice thickness with a balanced carbonation. An ok IPA. I am not as fond of it as i used to be. A bit too astringent for me",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,cvstrickland,4.33,"12 oz bottle poured aggressively into a tulip yields a clear brown-amber body with a towering four fingers of off-white rocky head that diminishes to a sticky sheet that leaves gobs of soapy lacing.  Aromatic hops; fruity, floral, with a hint of brown malt hidden in the background;  The taste is a turnabout from the smell-- sweetness from rich brown-biscuity malt comes first, and is engaged by a bevy of tart, floral, and grapefruity hops that keep it in check.  Crisp,nicely carbonated, with a pleasantly dry and slightly astringent finish. An all-day brewski, and another win for Victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Slynger,3.85,"Now this is a nice little IPA. Cloudy golden orange color with an orange tinted lid. Lightly sweet and caramelish smells, but lemony and citrusy hops reign. Soft and light oily smooth. Biscuit and caramel malts play a role in the flavor, but theres a pleasant hoppy bitterness of grapefruit and orange peel. Victory has a pretty solid IPA here folks.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Damian,3.7,"Drank on-tap at Miracle of Science Bar & Grill, Cambridge, MA  Poured a gorgeous, crystal clear, dark orangey-amber with a clingy, off white, one-finger head that lasted the duration of the beer. Thin blankets of lacing clung to the sides of the glass.  The aroma was very mild. A touch of husky malt was barely noticeable. Hop notes were practically non-existent. For such a hop-focused beer, I was shocked that the aroma was not more pronounced.  What the aroma lacked, the taste more than made up for. A touch of creamy maltiness came through up front before the hops took over. Intense orange and grapefruit notes dominated (cascade hops I presume?). Caramel malts provided just enough balance to keep this beer from being overwhelming bitter. More grapefruit and pine on the finish with a dry, pithy, resiny finish that lingered for quite some time.  Mouthfeel was medium bodied. Creamy and smooth with a fine, moderate carbonation.  Drinkability was rather good for such an intensely hoppy brew.  This beer is called ""Hop Devil"" for a reason. Few IPA's showcase West Coast style hops better than this one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,dhd1491,4.3,Dense tan head of creamy foam. Clear golden-copper appearance. Slight floral aroma. Nice floral-sour hoppy punch with good malty-sweet balance. Really easy to drink; ranks with the best IPA's I've tried. Might have helped that it was on tap versus bottled. Went great with hot wings.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Grapefruit citrus taste. Some light malt backbone to it. Enough to provide a small semblance of balance to the beer.  M/D - Excellent all around. Medium bodied with excellent carbonation. The bitterness is the only thing holding it back on the drinkability, but I think that is a good thing.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Tilley4,3.64,Not exactly sure who this bottle came from but I know it was a trade as I can't get it locally.  This is one beautiful IPA here. It looks like an Imperial IPA with a huge billowy fluffy head that is just magnificent..  Very astringent aroma... Its hoppy but sort of smells like hair spray..  This reminds me a lot of Two Hearted on the taste... Quite bitter but not overly so... Very hoppy..  Good but not great... Its a solid ass little IPA but not spectacular..,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Neehan,3.93,"Bronze body with a medium-sized head and excellent retention. A bit hazy and very appealing. Very hoppy (obviously) and bitter without the additional sweetness than many of this style have, but very true-to-form. The bitter flavor may slightly hinder the drinkability. Personally, not my favorite in this style but a very well-crafted beer that is sure to please.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,bjoyce12,3.98,"Excellent. I'm a huge believer in truth in advertising, and Hop Devil fits the bill. Huge smack of hops. From something called ""Hop Devil"", I would expect nothing less. Pours a foamy dark golden. Can notice the hops scent right away. Good sign. Hops comes through from first taste through to the aftertaste.

345,1005,avalon07,4,"A: When poured from a bottle to a pint glass, had a bright amber color and a somewhat cloudy texture. There was an inch of head that dissipated quickly.  S: Floral hops, a bit of malt and something sweet in this area.  T: Naturally, as the name would imply, the hops were front and center. There are also some caramel(?) flavors, as well as malt.  M: There was a good amount of carbonation and a slightly slick finish here.  D: Overall, this is a pretty drinkable beer. The hops provide a sharp bitterness, but it's a well-balanced flavor.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,sheathead,4.63,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass  Amber in color. 1/4 inch head. Leaves some lacing on the glass.  Slight floral smell with maybe some caramel?  Starts with a big hop bite. The malty back bone somewhat balances the hops, but the hop bite comes back at the finish.  Not overly carbonated. Just enough to feel a tingle on your tongue.  This is a very drinkable beer. The ABV isn't too high and the hops are kept in check enough that they don't become too much after a few beers.  HopDevil is one of my favorite beers, which is why it's my first review. Victory brews a damn fine American IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

A nice well balanced taste hops at first...slight bitterness not over powering...sweet caramel malt in the background. Well balanced.  A nice IPA in my book. This has to be one of the most balanced IPA's that I've had.

345,1005,ebit,4.16,"Apperance Lot's of head when poured aggressively. It sticks around too. A beautiful amber orange for the body with hints of red in the middle and yellow at the edges.  Smell A non-overpowering combination of light citrus and piney hops are first to the nose instantly. Traces of grain malt are just barely evident. Very clean smelling but could be a bit more aromatic.  Taste Citrusy hops and spices charge forward early almost drowning out everything on with grainy malts in the background. Grainy malts take precedence as you swallow with bread and slight honey flavors. All build to a bitter but not unpleasant aftertase as hops whisk everything away.  Mouthfeel Carbonation bites early on giving it a crisp feel. A medium light body counters the bite with a bit of smoothness. Leaves the mouth a bit dry and wanting another drink. This is about what the beer should feel like, not only does it allow you to focus on the hop flavors in the brew but I'd go so far as to say it even enhances them.  Drinkability The hops might turn some but it adds a unique character to the beer as they literally attack your tongue from the get-go. Able to be consumed at an above average rate if you want a beer that feels light but aggressive on the palate. The alcohol might catch up with you after a few but it's worth the journey.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Pencible,4.37,"This poured dark orange with only a little head. It had a perfect blend of hops and malt, which gave it both a very sweet and bitter flavor. This is just what an IPA should taste like, in my opinion. It had a decent texture, but nothing substantial there. Overall it was quite easy to drink and just as rewarding.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,cjohnson,4,"Pours a dark reddish-amber with about an inch and a half of head, and a nice little bit of carbonation bubbles coming up through the beer.  Very nice smelling beer with a spicy and (unsurprisingly) hoppy nose.  Very hoppy, a little too so for my liking, but not so much as to be overwhelming. A pretty strong bitterness comes with the hops, and maybe just a hint of malt sweetness to finish. Fairly spicy.  Medium bodied mouthfeel; nothing incredible.  I found this pretty drinkable, even though I don't love this style. Not my favorite pale ale I've had this evening, but certainly a respectable offering from Victory that people who like IPAs will undoubtedly enjoy.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Beergeeknut,3.45,Appearance: Pours a golden amber with a light foamy head. With slight orange hues.  Aromas: The hop nose is big on this one. Light hints of caramel malts.  Taste: It starts off with a bit of crisp mouthfeel. The hoppiness of this one has a great bite to it along with a spice to it as well. There is slight sweetness to it. It's not has hoppy as I thought it might be but it's good.  Notes: This is my second offering from Victory and it's a tasty one. This certainly is a beer that can be enjoyed year round.

T: Citrus peel and some evergreen resins, balanced nicely for the style with a bit of a burnt malt in the front.  M: A medium, well rounded body with a little stickiness on the teeth. A nice finish, imparting a nice lingering flavour with a slick oiliness.  D: A higher ABV as per the style make it a slower drinker, but easy enough to drink. Ended up pairing it with a bison burger, and they went together quite nicely.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,CrellMoset,4.15,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle (with an awesome piece of cover art) into a pint glass.  Appearance: A honey-amber/orange brew, hazy, with aggressive carbonation and sticky lacing. Nice.  Smell: Floral, earthy, and sweet! Citrus (grapefruit and orange rind) and floral hops mingle with a rustic and bready but nonetheless saccharine and honey-like malt profile. A slight whiff of alcohol finishes off the nose.  Taste: Sweet honey, largely in balance with aggressively, grassy, rustic, and bitter hops. A really nice balance, actually - it's not an ""even"" balance, but it's right about where it should be. The bittering hops leave quite a stinging finish, but it's not one that stays for too long. Alcohol is present, but not overwhelming - it's slightly spicy, but that's largely overwhelmed by the hops. A relatively simple flavor profile, but a well-balanced albeit strong one.  Mouthfeel: Creamy velvet with a medium, oily body. A great carbonation profile. It lingers, but not oppressively so.  Drinkability: Mild alcohol content at 6.7%, a great taste (so balanced) and mouthfeel (so creamy), and no funny, lingering aftertaste, besides the dull, bitter sting left by the hops. What's not to love?  A really great overall beer, that (for me, at least) strikes a really good balance between bitter hoppiness and sweetness. Not my favorite IPA, but definitely up there. I purchased the single for $1.70, which means a sixer probably rolls in at around 9 bucks, which is perfectly reasonable for an IPA sixpack.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,ccrida,4.1,"12 oz. bottle poured into an impy pint glass, Hop Devil is clear copper with a tight, creamy khaki head that is long lasting, leaving moderate lace.  Smell is softer floral, citrus hops, fairly spicy.  Taste very well balanced for a big IPA, my favorite thing about this beer, which I've had many, many times. I really like how floral the hops are, big but subdued at the same time, a much different hop profile then the pine/grapefruit combo I've become so accustomed to here in the NW. Smooth semi-sweet malt is countered by a very firm bitterness.  Mouthfeel oily, with a medium-light body.  Drinkability is high. Hop Devil keeps it smooth while still delivering a very sophisticated hop fix, with almost no indication of the robust ABV. This is so anti-west coast, I love it! Brings but great memories of my 10 years in Pittsburgh.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

A- Red Amber, big white head, rapid fire carbonation  S- Hoppy, piney with nice citrus notes, subtle malt  T- Very fresh hops come through, a lot of nice fruit blasts as well, it sports a nice crisp dry pilsner like finish.

The hops come through in a much more subtle way. They are not as overpowering as with a bottle. (I still love bottled/tap hop devil though) And its room temperature serving makes its citrusy flavors come through a lot more.  This is a very sophisticated ale, after drinking the cask, it makes the bottled stuff taste better too because I am way more aware of all of the flavors interacting instead of just hop flavor.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

S: Nice hoppy aroma. Tons of grapefruit with mild touches of nutty toffee malt.  T: In the bottle it took a bit for the hops to kick in. On cask I tasted wonderful grapefruit hops right from the start. There was a wonderful malt backbone to even things out making this one enjoyable brew.  M: Medium bodied and ultra crisp on the palate.  D: Nice drinkable brew, on cask this one is down right sessionable.  Overall: Nice aggressive IPA. Perfect balance between hop and malt.

345,1005,SurlyDuff,4.47,"One of the most balanced ipa's that I have ever had. There's a big hop presense, but Victory has added enough malt to make this very drinkable with a great mouthfeel.  Orangy copper with a tan head. A tad overzealous pour on my part (couldn't wait to try maybe?) resulted in a couple inches of foam. No biggie.  Aroma and taste are similar. Hops (spicy, piney)and caramel-flavored malts take turns assailing your senses.  In one sip, I noticed the hops and malt each poke through atleast twice during the taste, from beginning to finish.

Smells of malt and spicy, earthy hops with some citrus notes like orange. Taste is of floral hops up front followed by a solid malt backbone and a nice spicy dry hop finish. Not as prominently hoppy as the West Coast Style, more of a blending of British IPA and APA. Medium in body with good carbonation and a good overall balance. Not overly hoppy, meaning it won't ruin your taste buds and quite sessionable. Could drink several of these at a sitting and not be bored.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I expected and is a bit dry in the finish, no lingering hops on the palette. Great brew, not as hoppy as some out there, but certainly very drinkable.

345,1005,TheodorHerzl,3.03,"Received from Abankovich in trade. Thank you.  This beer pours a deep amber with one finger of white head. This is a deeper color than most other IPA's I've encountered. It does leave very good lacing on my pint glass. Hops are the only thing I smell on this beer, but that isn't really a good thing. The hop scent is rather muted and not as bold as I was expecting. I don't really pick up any other secondary scents as well. The taste is very sweet upfront with a bit of caramel before the hops take over and assert themselves, but the hops fizzle out rather quickly and leave a tea-bitterness for the rest of the beer. I am rather unsatisfied with each passing drink. The mouthfeel is rather thin, but there is quite a bit of astringency that normally isn't found on IPA's.  I am not sure what I am missing on this one, but I am rather let down.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

The mouthfeel is kind of thin and watery but still above average. Drinkability is good, very balanced.

345,1005,bluemoonswoon,3.7,"12oz bottle poured into a tulip glass, best before April 14 08 stamped onto the side of the bottle.  A: Pours a very appetizing dark and clear mahogany or any other looking kind of finished wood. Pours a rocky off white head one inch thick with a promisingly sticky looking bubble down but the head disappears entirely in a few minutes. Great sticky lacing now that I've had a chance to drink this beer though and what saves the appearance along with the nice color on the beer.  S: I was expecting more of a hop explosion but this one is a bit more balanced, don't get me wrong the hops are still there in spades but a nice dextrose malt aroma keeps things all nicely balanced. Not as fresh and clean smelling as I would have hoped for though  T/MF: Again not at all as hoppy I was expecting not as citrusy and juicy, nutty and piny to be sure, not sweet, not overly bitter but still leaves a cloying drying sensation on the back of the tongue and some additional prickly malt bitterness on the roof of the mouth, exceedingly complex but tastes and feels a little flat and watery in the mouth.  D: To be honest I was a bit disappointed in this beer, especially at 10.99 a six pack, maybe this one suffers from being close to the expiration date but as it stands this beer seems only average to the lush array of other American IPAs out there.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

There is some nice lacing that looks like ink blots forming down the side of the glass as I sip.  The beer smells delicate with some hints of orange. It tastes bitter. Lemon a grapefruit dominate. Malt is hard to detect, but I taste some caramel in the background. To me, this beer does not have enough character to back up the smooth bitterness. It leaves a dry metallic sensation on my tongue. The mouthfeel is a tad thin and slightly under carbonated.  I will have no problem enjoying the rest of my 6 pack, but I had higher expectations of this beer. I'll give it another try in the future.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,LeftyBWS,3.63,"Poured from a 12 oz. brown bottle into a Sam Adams pint glass. A: Nice clean copper color, hinging on amber. A full 1.5 inches of whipped, off-white head with a couple frothy bubbles. Low and slow carbonation visible. Sheets of clingy lacing. S: Warm and muted citrusy scents mingle with some oily hops and caramel malts, all at once. Nice mixture, good combination. T: Citrus and oily hops with a bit of zest hit the palate up front. This gives way to some smoother malts, but they don't quite get there. The finish is hoppy, much like the first taste. Overall, good and satisfying, but relatively constant and unambitious. M: Smooth and slippery, actually. No prominent alcohol-ness, which is nice. D: Pretty good. I could easily drink these back to back.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,cdkrenz,3.65,"Appearance - The body is an orange-amber color with a nice haze to it. The head is white and frothy with some good stamina.  Smell - It has the scent of smooth hops, candy and spice.  Taste - Strong hoppy goodness with a hint of apricot.  Mouthfeel - The texture is a bit coarse. However, the way it rubs my mouth actually helps to bring out some of the flavor.  ~ This is a better than average brew without a doubt. I recommend to those who enjoy a good hop filled beer to take a stab at the Devil.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,JJJ22,4.04,"A: Crystal clear copper elixir, with a nice 1"" creamy head. The head rapidly disipates to a thin layer with lacing on the sides.  S: Hops don't assault my olfactories as much as I like for an IPA, though the label reads hopback rather than dryhopping, so could explain the lack of aroma -- more muted than in-your-face.  T: Nice and bitter. Well balanced against just the right amount of maltiness. A little light on the hop flavor, though. Probably the hopback vs. dry-hopping thing again.  M: Just the right amount of chewiness here. Not thin and bodiless like some of the IPAs I've had lately.  Definitely a buy-again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,JDV,3.77,"Rich copperish amber pour with a nice offwhite head. Light fresh, somewhat unique hop smell with some light sweetness in there too. Fairly sweet and mild for an IPA with some fresh, grassy hops. Could be slightly more flavorful, and really isn't that bold at all.

A touch of grainy maltiness. T - Quite similar to the smell but leaning towards the malty side of things, some caramel also in there. M - Medium bodied, slightly sticky, fairly low carbonation. D - A nice enough beer but my bottle seems to be lacking the hoppiness that others mentioned. It's tasty nonetheless and admittedly has traveled half way around the world in not so ideal conditions.

345,1005,KeggerKen,3.78,"It was a little difficult to take it serious based on its name...I thought this would just be some second rate IPA but was quite impressed.

Great IPA taste. The mouthfeel was medium body with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a very drinkable IPA.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,SaucyA,3.62,"A - Near-perfect looking IPA, two finger off-white creamy head. Tons of lacing. Golden orange and quite clear.  S - Slightly piney, earthy aroma. Metallic notes present. Lemon undertones. Not that appetizing.  T - Much more complex than the nose would lead you to think. Slightly grapefruity, lemony hop profile... finishes slightly dry and earthy but definitely a malt presence. Do I taste a smokey malt? Metallic undertones. I like the finish an awful lot. Reminds of how I thought beer tasted/smelled as a kid.  M - Slightly heavy bodied with a good presence of carbonation. Knocked down from a 5 because of the sparkling factor.  D - This is almost sessionable, but the higher ABV and metallic affect have thrown off the drinkability for me. Since I only have one to sample, I think I'll try this again at a later date.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,gwood,4.5,"I've been slowly picking up Victory beers now knowing that I want to try and enjoy them over time, HopDevil didn't let me down.  Freshness date on the bottle was Apr 14 08, so I'm glad I got this one when I did...a bit old however.  Pours a nice copper that has some dark orange highlights when held to the light. A big off white head climbed up and mounted the sides of my clean pint glass with uneven bubble sizes that formed small mountains as it subsided and started to lace down the edges. Smells of citrus immediately rose up out of this beer; grapefruit and oranges with hints of bready malt. This beer has a really stiff malt backbone, which I really like with this level of hops. Sweet and bready malts abound but quickly taken over by citrus, black pepper, and some green grass notes. Finish is lingering with much the same...sweet malts and spicey hops and a slight warming near the end of the fade. The mouthfeel is just smooth for the AA's present, really drinks quite well.  Yet again I've been very pleased with another Victory brew. Hop heads rejoice and give thanks.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,mltobin,4.22,"Served on-tap at a bar in Southwestern Connecticut, poured into a pint glass.  The appearance of HopDevil is a dark tone, cloudy, and a one finger head, very inviting.

Mouthfeel is very solid, attacking the different taste buds with some hops and a well balanced IPA.  Drinkability is very good, this is a great american IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,dedrinker,3.7,"Clear bronze color with an off-white head. Aromas of earthy hops and caramel malt. Flavor of hops first, then close behind is the sweet and so slightly roasty malt that makes this almost a New England/ U.K. style IPA, except that while it is not devilishly hoppy, it is more hopped than that. Medium body and a well-balanced hop/malt finish; earthy, slightly bitter and somewhat woodsy. I had this cask-conditioned once at the brewery and it was worth the road trip.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,drpimento,5,What a great beer! Matches its commercial description exactly. And I especially like the lack of fruitiness which I've grown to dislike in very hoppy beers. Poured with a nice head which lasted for quite a while and plenty of lace. Very aromatic hoppy maltiness in the nose. Good mouth if perhaps just the barest hint of being thin. Intense savory flavor is all the aroma is but so much more. Quite satisfying yet continuosly intriguing. Excellent finish.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

It was one of my last beers on a South Carolina/Georgia tour and it was a great way to finish.  A: Poured clear, slightly dark amber color. Good head that retained extremely well.  S: A good smell with one of the better hop smells shining through. A slight smell of caramel seemed to be present.  T: Great. Was expecting an overpowering taste and at first was dissapointed (more surprised) after I got over that it was a quick jump to the top of the hill. A good malty taste made the balancing complete on the fine IPA.  M: A smoother taste. The hops provided the right bite and aftertaste.  D: Very good, I switched off this to try something new. Wish I had not, will definately be seeing this beer again!  In summary not one for an extreme hop head, maybe what a hop head would drink when they want a lighter beer for a change.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Strong hop tastes, lots of pine with a leafyness,as grapefruityness comes through towards the finish. Excellent balance With a sweet carmell maltiness.  A good full mouthfeel with a twangy feel.

Very bitter towards the end. I enjoyed it but I don't think I could have more than a couple in one sitting because it's so dry at the end.

T-A wonderful hop-malt balance. Lots of piney, resiny flavor but a very solid malt backbone.  M-Very smooth. Hoppy bitterness lingers on the tongue, in a good way.  D-Very much so.  A long overdue review as this is (pretty close to) my hometown beer. This was the first local craft brew I discovered, many years ago. We still enjoy it, though there are so many choices it's not a weekly staple anymore. I was amazed at how well it holds up to a ""critical"" evaluation.

Maybe I'm being too hard on this beer, but after having several other really, really hoppy & good IPAs & double IPAs recently, this one's average. Perhaps it's the marketing. I can't think but something named ""Hop Devil"" should have a little more kick to it. It does go down a lot easier than the slam-bang-kick-you-in-the-hops beers, which often take me an hour or so to down.

S-wafts of hops fill my nostrils and i can feel my nose hairs tingle.  T-A bitter taste but thats an IPA.

The taste is malty and quite hoppy at the same time. The hops are the shining star, but there is a very nice malty sweetness that balances this beer quite well. The mouthfeel is medium but textured.

345,1005,AshevilleSippin,4.43,"Short Version: Outstanding brew with forward hops, remarkable balance, and smooth drinkability that's hard to beat. A bit too balanced for a true IPA in my opinion.  Details: This beer was a nice surprise. Picked it up at Ingles as part of a mix-n-match 6 packer. Great new system they have there. HUGE thumbs up to Ingles.  Attractive bottle with clever hop-flower looking like a friendly devil. I expected an insane one-dimensional hop bomb. I was pleasantly wrong.  This beer poured a semi-cloudy copper-amber color. Bold 3-finger creamy yellowish-tan head with notable endurance. Finally dropped to a thin film with active volcanic island activity after several minutes.  Strong hops on the nose with maybe some mild citrus notes. Some subdued herbalness perhaps. Very fresh smelling.  I get an earthy/dirty hop flavor with remarkable malt balance. Hops win... but not by as much as you'd expect. Strong but not overwhelming. Appetizing and delicious. Bright fruity esters on the back palate but not sweet. Can't quite place them.  Body is on the robust side of medium. Again, lacey and fresh in the glass and on the palate. Label calls this an India Pale Ale but it's a bit too balanced in my opinion to fit that bill. I expect my IPA to be bold and lopsided.  The finish is soft and fragrant with a pleasant maltiness that outlasts the hops.  Drinkability is through the roof.  This bottle is dated Jan 9, 2008 so a tad past it's prime. I'd give a case of about anything to try one of these fresh on draft. If it's this good a month past due out of a bottle... just imagine.  Ingredients: American hops. According to the label.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,BeerTaster,4.73,Appearance deep amber in color no haze. Smell floral hop and a bit of citrus.

345,1005,SIRIUS2,4.54,"I'm a fan of hoppy beer and this is one of the best I have ever had. If there was one thing that struck me about this beer is that there was a presence of hops through the entire tasting experience. The bouquet was soft and floral and the first sip matched well, unlike some other hop-heavy brews that tend to be sharp and oily. Great medium weight body and mouthfeel. The finish was just as even and smooth as the first parts of the experience. Fantastic!

The medium bodied beer rolls across the palate with a wallop of hops. A small hint of malt muscles its way through the assault of hops.

345,1005,77suburban,4.27,"Appearance: Dark amber color, I would even say orangish (if that term is permissible for beer). Cloudy, decent white head.  Smell: The smell really makes me want to take the first sip. Hoppy, of course, tending toward the citrus end. Malt aroma comes through very well.  Taste: It goes without saying, the hops are prominent. Very citrusy, orange-like character. A bit of ester comes through but the alcohol is well hidden; although it is only 6.7%. Well balanced IPA, the malt character is not totally buried which helps the smoothness of this bitter ale. On that note, the bitterness is quite tastefully expressed. A good helping of hops without making you pucker.  Notes: This is a very nice, easy drinking IPA. You could have a few of these without tiring of it. Smooth, balanced, and complex.

T: The taste is lightly malty with some residual sweetness that balances the mildly aggressive hop bitterness. Spicy hop flavors that have some floral character but not much.  M: The body is heavy light or light medium with medium carbonation. This beer is not dry but minimally sweet which provides a thirst quenching aspect.  D: The thirst quenching aspect of this beer makes it go down very well. With minimal residual sugars and minimal hop bitterness this beer is well balanced.  Notes: I am hop head. I like this beer.

S- Light citrus notes, floral aromas and pears detected in the nose. Hops were very prsent in the nose as well.  T- A gentle hop bitterness with the fruit flavors noted in the nose present in the taste as well. Mild spice notes are present. The hops are fairly mellowed out in this one, not nearly as agressive on the bitterness as say Hop Wallop from the same brewery. It doesn't help that its Jan 17 08 and the drink by date on the bottle was for oct 16 07.  M- Dry and crisp. Not syrupy at all. Easy to swish, which is nice for making the most out of what hops are still present in this expired bottle.  D- Goes down nice and easy and each sip is enjoyable. I could easily down a few of these if the mood struck me, however the hop content was disapointing for an IPA as well reviewed as this. My hope is that this is due to the age of this bottle and not the quality of the product, as Victory has yet to disapoint me in any other instance. I will have to grab a fresher one at my local liquor store and update this review and give this one another shot.  **** Update as of 2.11.08****  Tried a fresher bottle and was much more impressed... the issues I had before were mainly due to the beer being past its peak and losing much of the strong hop character that makes an IPA. The one I had last night was much fresher, and the hop character was much stronger and on par with what I expect from a good session IPA. All other notes are still valid and consistent with what was noted before, but I am moving the taste score up by half a point.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,Mazeraski,4.2,"From a 12 oz. bottle into a glass stein with freshness date February 11th 2008.  A - Pours a hazy, amber honey color with a half inch head that dissipates slowly and a sticky lacing that clings to the glass.  S - Well-balanced smell of hops, citrusy grapefruit, small grain and the faintest note of alcohol. Not too strong of a smell, yet not weak. Becomes more pronounced as it warms.  T - The strong, spicy wave of hops mixed with hints of alcohol hit your taste buds first, reminding you that you are drinking an IPA. Toasted sweetened malt, citrus and honey flavor rush in only to be beaten down by another forceful and strong rush of hops with a lingering alcohol taste and just the tiniest hint of malt that results in more of a dry, spicy finish.  M - A smooth and creamy medium-bodied IPA, with well-balanced carbonation.  D - Seems to be quite drinkable. For an IPA named HopDevil, I expected more hoppy bitterness to it, however it was very well-rounded with an spicy hop fix to it that mixed very well with the rest of the brew. Something to tip back and enjoy more than a few during a warm summer day. My first tasting of a Victory brew and I am quite impressed. Definitely recommended.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,jdmorgan,4.1,"The appearance of this Pale Ale was an amber/golden hazy color with a medium white head that dissipated over time.  The smell had a small aroma of hops and a bit of citrus as well. The taste had a bit of malt sweetness and a very blunt strike of hop flavor finishing with hop bitterness. The alpha acids in this brew were pronounced, but bitterness was managed well. I also think that the hop selection was appropriate as well. The consistency was medium and smooth with a medium carbonation.  I thought that this was a very good beer and should definately be tried by those who love AIPAs, IPAs, or any heavily hopped brew. However, I had to knock it a little on drinkability because I can't see drinking these over and over.

Upon the first sniff I proclaimed to myself 'It smells like Budweiser' and to me, it does, absolutely nothing here for me in the smell department. Upon taste, it kinda tastes like budweiser too, although with the typical hoppy bitterness of ales. The mouthfeel is very bright on the tounge, too much carbonation for my tastes. I suppose this might be a good session beer if you want something like an american lager with hops. But I might recommend looking for something else in the American IPA department.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Phocion,3.95,"Pours a dark golden amber with a frothy beige head with amazing retention. Exactly what I expect an IPA to look like... so far, so good.  The nose is dominated by the aromas of grapefruit and orange. A hint of spiciness as well, and although I can't definitely place it I want to say coriander. Surprisingly heavy malts as well, with a whiff of heavy caramel hiding right behind the citric hops.  Very earthy flavor. The hops are somewhat disappointing for an IPA and along with a toasted malt taste my mouth is filled with an almost burnt aftertaste.  Clean and dry mouthfeel with healthy carbonation. It's not bad and it's better balanced than most IPAs, but when I buy a bottle with a picture of a demonic hop flower on the front I expect a bit more in the way of bitterness. Still, I won't have a problem finishing off the sixer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,lpb1970,4.35,"The Victory Hop Devil displays a clear, leather like color. Very nice. The head retains a lacing throughout. The aroma is strong piney, citrusy hops with an enticing malt sweetness. Body is medium with slightly above average carbonation which works perfectly for the beer. The taste is that crisp, fresh, citrus hop taste and a delicious bitterness that tells me those beautiful little cones went into the boil good and early. Your girlfriend who drinks Blue Moon won't like this beer. There is a nice sweet malt follow up that perfectly complements the hop dominance. Bottom Line: This is a top five IPA for an East Coast fella like myself. You will have to scour the continent to find a better IPA.

345,1005,tgbljb,4.35,"Enjoyed on cask at the brewpub. Served as a medium amber colored beer with white creamy head. Perfect lacing. Smell has a more restrained hop character than the bottled version. Taste also has the hops more restrained. They seeem to be more flavorful than bitter, and this presents with a very different, and enjoyable,beer. Finish is also less bitter. An excellent beer. The cask version, in my opion, is even more enjoyable than the bottle.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Drewcifer,4.22,"Pours a nice, cloudy amber/copper color with a decent off-white head.  The smell is a good, citrusy, hoppy smell, not overpowering, not as strong as expected.  The taste is well-balanced, not overly hoppy as you may expect from the name. The hops are there, but backed by a citric tang.  A good, medium body with a decent amount of carbonation give it a pleasant mouthfeel, finishes a bit dry.  The overall drinkability of HopDevil is decent. Its all-around a solid beer, maybe not with quite the over-the-top punch that hopheads crave, but that makes it much more accessible to those trying to find a good, solid IPA to get started in the world of craft beers with. Its not insanely hopped, not overly bitter, and doesnt have a monster ABV, all of which make it a very enjoyable beer that can be had in decent amounts without getting sick or tired of it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,maddogruss,3.45,"Had this once in college when I was still ""in the dark."" Did not like it then, so i decided to revisit now that I have a more ""educated"" palette. Poured a 12 ounce bottle into a glass mug.  A: Pours an amber body with an off-white head with decent retention. Eventually slows ot a small lacing along the top of the beer with some lacing along the sides of the glass.  S: A nice, hoppy smell. Not as strong as I expected, but still fairly evident.  T: A rather hoppy taste, but not as much as I expected. Some malts in the aftertaste as a balancer, but the hops were not as strong to really balance the beer.  M: Pretty full-bodied, but slightly on the light side. Carbonation was okay.  D: Fairly drinkable beer. Good mouthfeel with an ok taste. I expected a little bit more of a bittering hop taste from the beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

S: Big hop aroma with a sweet malt background.  T: A big and balanced IPA. Big hop flavors in the form of orange citrus and quite a bit of pine to go along with a solid grainy malt base. Finishes crisp and dry.  M: I like the mouthfeel, it's smooth and a bit creamy and even a bit thick.  D: A solid IPA. A bit different than the west coast hop-bombs that I'm used to but still very good for the style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,hustlesworth,4.49,"A- pours a hazy rusty reddish copper amber with 1 1/2in creamy dreamy beige head that becomes a giant crater of foam as it slowly settles. great retention, and webs of lace as if the old lady across the street knitted it.  S- toffee praline and marshmallow. that's the best way i can describe the aroma of certain ales (i.e. cumberland, stone ipa, hopdevil) but maybe someday i'll be able to place the actual aroma. most likely a malt/hop combination. anyway, fruity caramel apple aromas rise in a thick vapor with date, fig, prune, butterscotch, sandalwood, and faint milk chocolate.  T- very complex as it goes along. very caramel and malty for a split second up front followed by a huge zap of earthy resinous hops, soil, compost, used coffee grounds, and the same faint cocoa as the aroma. malty pear/apple sweet and dark fruits, strawberry, woodsy spicy herbal hops hold strong in the middle with pancake batter, toasted grains, and hazelnut, tapering slowly into a dry apple cider sour cream/cream cheese scotch whisky finish.  MF- heavy syrupy body goes down smooth and juicy due to its mid-level carbonation. there's so much taste and aroma going on in here that one can barely notice the mouthfeel. nevertheless, it seems to fit a brew of this magnitude.  D- hopheads young and old come imbibe in the glory of the friendly hopdevil. i had the victory hopdevil pint glass for 5 months before i actually got to taste the beer...mission accomplished.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Hoppington,3,"I have to disagree with the experts on this one. This just didn't quite do it for me and I was dissapointed and felt the hophead experience wasn't there. That's what I get for looking at the ""RateBeer"" rating that many retailers are now posting in the beer cases next to the beers. For my palate, I think Troeg's Hopback Amber Ale is a better pick in this category. Just not hoppy enough for what I consider to constitute a great American IPA. I think this beer is *much* better on tap than in the bottle. With a name like ""HopDevil"" this beer should be sinfully hoppy!  Don't get me wrong - this was OK and quite drinkable, but compared to other offerings out there in the American IPA category, this one comes up average across the board to my taste buds.

345,1005,Homerbag,3.85,"Poured a cloudy dark copper with thin IPA head.  Smelles of citrusy hops, some grain. Very welcoming.  Taste is good. Nice fruity hop burst. Not overwhelming. Some honey undertones than compliment the overall hoppiness.  Feels rather light and dry compared with the usually heavy IPA style. Leaves with little aftertaste.  Overall a nice IPA, a great compliment to a plate of hot wings and blue cheese.

Some frothy head but little to no carbonation of course being cask conditioned. Good walls of thin lace stick to the glass.  Lots of citrus and caramel malt in the nose, not to mention some deep floral hops. Pine and spice are accompanied with sweet honey and lighter toffee. Very nice as always.  Smooth and bold with and initially sweetness consisting of caramel malt and citrus. Then comes the hops; bitter and herbal but with a mellowing sweet maltiness. The hops linger well and finish with a spicy floral note.  Buttery and smooth in texture with that familiar mellow cask feel. Velvety and clean with no real carbonation. The texture and bitterness really linger past the finish as well.

S: Clean floral hops with plenty of orange and grapefruit esters without the oiliness. A slightly sweet and grainy malt background rounds things out.  T/M: Lots of bittering hops up front. Juicy and sweet grapefruit. Malts are on the weak side, adding a touch of sweetness and some body to the drink. Medium with enough carbonation. Dry bittering finish.

345,1005,ZimZamZoom,4.53,"Bottle expiration date is March, 2008. Also clearly printed on the sampler 12-pack. Thanks very much for that Victory!  A nice deep amber color, with a creamy light tan head that rose to two fingers and never receded past one, all the while maintaining a death-grip on the side of my pint glass.  Aroma of caramel and malt, balanced nicely by the citrusy American hops mentioned on the bottle. Based on the aroma, this should really be called Balance-devil. More and more it's what I am looking for from this style, and not all of them deliver. I was thinking that until I tasted it!  Yes the malt is there up front, but it's immediately usurped by an onslaught of big citrus-laden hops, a bit of hoppy spice and even some alcohol. The grapefruit in this AIPA remains with you through the finish, and then some malt sweetness peeks back through the haze, interestingly enough leaving you with an overall sensation of the balance I mentioned earlier.  This is one well-done beer. Smooth and creamy, with a medium body, and nicely carbonated taboot. I could definitely hit a few of these in a night.

Even though it is over the top the way none of the imports are (yet), it is very drinkable. I could have several of these, although I usually savor them!

345,1005,tfuchs,3.93,"Bottle I picked up at TotalWine in Annandale poured into a heavy 14oz mug. This is the second or third time I've had the Hop Devil.  Hop Devil poured a beautifully consistent amber. A very thin head dissipated quickly, but that could be as much the fault of my dishsoap as poor retention.  The pine and cream aromas hit first, and with some searching, the pale malts filled out the tail. Good, indicative aromas for a balanced IPA.  The taste was clearly pine and citrus, mostly lemon, but next up I was stung with the sharp taste of copper. Not awesome, but it did fade after the first sip. To fast forward, that's probably the only negative on this one. Otherwise, well balanced for an IPA named Hop Devil. Again, for the style, there was plenty of light caramel and cream in the backseat to add to the depth and balance of the Hop Devil - the biggest little beer in America, err something.  It's embarrassing, but in my notes I actually wrote ""superb"" when I turned my attention to the texture and mouthfeel. But yeah, it was. Understandably thick for the ABV and depth typical of the heavier IPAs. Carbonation was complementary, just enough to cut the texture and tickle the tongue.  Anyone like me that holds a special place in their heart / brain / stomach for DIPAs will probably find the Hop Devil quite drinkable and come back for more. And if you like IPAs, but are more moderate (balance is paramount) Hop Devil could be a weekend fling. And if you don't like heavy hops, well, it's called Hop Devil. Yeah.  Despite the fact that it made me use words like superb, tickle, and special place, I really like the Hop Devil. The copper tinge wasn't enough of a problem to ruin the taste, and that's not something I've noticed when I had had it before. A very good heavy IPA.  I need to sit down and pit the devil against Troegs HopBack. A Susquehannan backyard brawl of sorts.

The nose is extremely balanced. Lots of bread and caramel malt to equal the piny and citrusy hops. But it's just to laid back to make it outstanding.  Tastes of bitter piny hops, orange, a bit of grapefruit and a solid amount of lightly toasted malt. Very well made and extremely drinkable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Gehrig,4.5,"Another excellent offering from Victory, HopDevil is a full-frontal hopped-up assault on the taste buds. Good, strong presentation, with one and a half fingers topping off a rich, cloudy amber body. The nose was good, full of hops and a whiff of fruit.

A little bit of a background of some malt, but did I mention hops.  T - Well, you get what's advertised. I enjoy it, though I can't say it's very well ballanced, the hops are really out in the forefront here with a crisp and piney flavor... a really wide range of hops flavors. Theres a kind of base malt flavor here, but the hops roll over that.  M - A malty fairly thick body... almost creamy in consistency.

T - Initial flavor was moderately bitter, followed by an average finish. Much better on cask that in the bottle! Overall, not as hoppy as I was expecting. Hops are definitely more floral than citrus.  M - Medium body with a very creamy texture and virtually no carbonation. This brew felt amazing in the mouth.

T - Bitter at first hit and sweet aftertaste that lingers at the back of your tongue. The bitterness hangs on your breath at the back of your throat. The hops is an earthy taste I can't quite pinpoint.  M - Smooth, not too carbonated or lively. Heavier than many other IPAs I've had, but I certainly wouldn't call this beer thick; after all it is still an IPA. It's near a medium mouthfeel.  D - I really like this beer. Its a drink you enjoy over time and not drink too quickly for an IPA.

345,1005,bigeyedfish,4.05,"Poured from a 12oz bottle, drink by 11 February 08 into a pint glass.  Once in pint glass, the beer comes with a really nice, foamy mother of pearl head, which starts receding quickly, but not at an alarming rate, leaving a moderate amount of lacing. The color is somewhere in between medium to dark orange and ruby red; in short, an awesome looking beer.  When put to the nose the beer comes off with pine, pine, and more pine. Not exactly the balanced IPA, but not a super dry pine smell either. It's a more complete, deep pine (assuming, for the minute that Weyerbacher's Double Simcoe is the dry pine). It's piney, but it's deep and inviting at the same time. It's unassumingly intimaditing. There's something else on the nose too, besides pine; I can't pin point it exactly, but the best I can say is that it smells like carrots. This aroma isn't until the head is almost gone, save for a thin shean on the top and aromatics have been taken for a minute to a minute and a half. But the pine definatley recedes over time, and leaves carrots. Interesting.  A lot of pine, a lot of cedar. The finish is huge(after more than :30 seconds it's still there.) There's a lot in the end, but that's produced with the front and mid-palate being sacrificed to the Gods of Pine in the end. There's a little transition in the mid-palate, a little nice hint of mint and pine, nothing to get excited about, but that's it for first and second flavors. You don't really get into the flavors until you really get deep into this beer- at first glance the strong finish makes you think it's a full flavor, but after inspection, it proves to be just a super big finish with everything else a little lacking. Kind of dissapointing, actually.  Mouthfeel is really nice- big, luscious and definatley a coating of bitter hops. A little carbonation floating around, and the beginning sip is a little tough with the bitterness, it's almost too much at first. The bitterness dissappears around mid-palate and comes through big time at the end, with the explosion of pine. But really, a pleasant beer to drink. There are a lot of people who would be offended by this beer, but if you're used to the style it'll be something to take notice of, and then in turn to settle into; there might some people who like IPA's may not like this beer, but it won't be because of the mouthfeel. The first sip is a bit of a shock, but after that, you know what you're getting.  I'm not sure where I want to go on the drinkability on this one. On one hand, it's an absolute palate bomb that will destroy your tastebuds and it's hard to forsee drinking more than one of these while still being able to taste anything, not to mention the almost 7% alcohol which means you're looking at 4/5 being a very good night. On the other hand, after one to one and a half there's not much you can taste besides this, so really, it only gets easier to drink after teh first one (if you ever had more than one Festina Peche in the same night, with the second one being easier to drink- it's kind of like that). With all that said I can remember a handful of nights where this ran the gauntlet- first beer of the night, holding its own with a strong, full bodied cigar (even danced brilliantly with a La Flor Dominicana Coronado, which is known for it's pineyness) and can be something that after 5/6 you can still drink standing up; in it's body it's a DIPA- in its drinkability, it's an IPA.  This probably is the marijuana of IPA's; that gateway version of the style that fans of the more classic IPA's (Bell's Two Hearted immediatley comes to mind) can use to get into bigger IIPA's(with the afformentioned Weyerbacher Double Simcoe proving to be a natural progression from this) while still having the IPA abv; a classic within the style, but not a classic example of the style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,cswhitehorse,4.03,The hopdevil comes with a cool label of a devilish looking hop and a consume by date. Nice. It pours a clear amber with a nice foam head the leaves some money web lacing on the side of the glass. The aroma is hoppy with a tiny maltiness. The taste of the brew is not overwhelmingly hoppy for an IPA. You get a whoppy spiciness at the end of the drink in the back of your mouth. It tasted to me like there was a strong hop talent to it with a balance of malt in the background. Very good IPA.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,Folderol,3.93,"On tap at McIntyre's in Toms River.  I'd say the most impressive aspect of this beer was the head. It's thick, full and cream-colored, not what I'm used to seeing on an ale. Smell is of hops, but not the piney stuff I'm used to finding. I couldn't quite place the flavor either; it's hops, but there was something unique about it. Overall, a well-balanced beer, not overwhelmingly hoppy but definitely sturdy. Drinkability was quite good.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,holzmann,4.27,"This is one of the beers that I place in my ""Solid IPA"" category: never disappoints, but still has a special character at that. Strong hop body with smokey tones and flavor with a good hop bite in the finish.Great hop aroma that is however not quite as flowery or complex as other IPAs of its caliber.

It is no longer as BIG as it use to be as tons have breweries have made brews far bigger than this old gaurd. Due to all of this it has been a long time since I have had a HopDevil. Being on cask though at the Zeno's real ale fest gave me good reason to revisit this old friend, and I am glad I did!  A--light orange copper with a thick white head  S--Lovely floral hop kick. A true sniffer.  T--Great, fresh hop flavor with a really solid malt bill. A well balanced beer.  M--Rich and full bodied. Offers up a nice hop bite aftertaste.

Maltiness dominates, but no powerful sweetness. Pleasant.  T - A great balance. The bitterness is most evident in aftertaste. In the mouth, there is a good deal of light malt flavor.  M - Thick for its style, but actually more true to form than most of its competitors. There is not the high carbonation that is often present in AIPA which, I think, is misguided - excellent in this regard.  D - Very good. A little thick, a little too malty to make it an over the top AIPA, but truer to its British inspirations. I like this a whole bunch!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Right after the pour the smell of piney hops is most evident. After the head settles down a bit of malt is detectable.  The taste is a very hoppy, just what you expect. It is nicely balanced with the slightly sweet malt that is detectable on finish. It feels crisp and with the good carbonation really make this a very drinkable IPA. Light to medium body.

Impressive from the start.  S: Malt and hops, hops and malt. Best explanation of the aroma would be thick that would lead to a depth in the flavor.  T: Again, hops and malts- ideally what an IPA should be. Sticks around for a while on the palate and never annoying. The overall flavor is perfectly balanced.  M: Carbonation and thickness just right. The texture was thick enough but really hid the ABV, ridiculously smooth.  D: Drinkability through the roof. One of, if not the most, drinkable IPAs Ive ever tasted. Cant wait to have many more. On tap really was a treat.  Ive become infatuated with IPAs lately and this one is among the best.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

The head is pillow soft and creamy, and retains a  Smell is pine and citrusy hop aromas, and only a hint of caramel malt. The smell is a bit light, the weakest part of a beer that is not for the feint of hops.  The taste is super flavorful hops, with grapefruit, orange and lots of pine, too. Hops also supply ample bitterness. There is enough of a caramel malt backbone to keep the hops from getting out of hand, as the bitterness is pretty strong. Mouthfeel is creamy and slick, and this is one of the tastiest and most drinkable IPAs out there.  This is truly a hop lovers IPA. The malt is there, but the hops dominate. Balance? Not so much. But it's awesome.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,PhageLab,3.57,"I poured this 12 oz bottle into my Hobgoblin glass. Right off the bat I was surprised by both the aroma and color of this brew, definitely intriguing.  A - Nice clean light brown with hints of amber. Under certain lights it almost looks red. Medium sized head that eventually left, but the lacing was great.  S - HopDevil indeed, well it cleared my sinus anyways! The floral scent was there, but couldn't shine through until the very end. It almost smells like there is a blend of cherry in there as well.  T - Hard to explain. Seems like a blend between a nut brown ale and an IPA. Many may not agree with me here, but it has a roasted soothing aftertaste that I've only experienced with nut browns before. It threw me off because initially it's a hop blast and singe to the taste buds, yet afterwards I wasn't sure what I had drank. Hopefully this isn't my palate playing tricks on me. It's good at any rate.  M - The finish is a bit cleaner than I had expected, and it is fairly light bodied, nothing definitive here.  D - I would never turn one down, I'll say that much. Interesting profile, and quite drinkable, if for nothing else the curiosity of it's presentation. What you see is nothing like what you get, and that's not a bad thing.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Atricapilla,4.82,"I really thought this was a kick ass ale...It is what is says: hoppy. It has a nice amber color with a small, slightly creamy head. The head was a bit more constructed in the cask bier I had as opposed to the bottled versions. The aroma and taste were thoroughly dominated by hops, hops, and more hops. Goes down well and leaves a lingering hop aftertaste.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Translucent deep ruby color. I'm actually surprised at how clear this is. Small amounts of lacing remain on the glass.  S: While pouring, could smell the hops easily with the glass being over a foot from my face. After the head settled though I couldn't detect much.  T: Quite hoppy, but definitely not overpoweringly so. Almost spicy on the front end with a hop finish that sticks in my mouth for several minutes  M: Medium bodied, perfectly carbonated. Any more carb and it'd be too much, any less and it'd lose its spiciness.  D: It may be a good thing that I can't get this locally, because I could see myself drinking alot of these.

As the head dissipates.... it leaves pronounced lacing on the glass.  The aroma is definately of piney hops and some malt for balance.  The taste: Definately a hop bite to begin with but some sweetness comes through.... like brown sugar. A deep roasted malty finish is apparent. Good stuff. The hops prevails as the dominamt taste that lasts through the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Just a tad heavy on the carbonation... but still nice. Creamy, heavy beer.

The colour is copper to chestnut brown with a tan head that thins out but produces good lacing and lots of wispy film. Well carbonated. The nose is distinct pink grapefruit with a spicy citrus rind backdrop and maybe a hint of pine needles. The alcohol is well hidden with a sweet grapefruit taste, assertive hops, flashes of butterscotch. The mouthfeel throughout remains hoppy and crisp with a bitter-sweet lingering finish.

Well balanced flavors of caramel sweet malt support loads of hop bitterness and pine needle flavors. Big flavors abound in this classic example of an American IPA done well. Heavy doses of malt and sweetness, but the hops blast the palate clean for every new sip.  Easy to drink this beer. Goes well with extra-spicy mexican food.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,brewshakes,3.05,I picked this up in a mixed six pack from Total Wine. This beer poured a copper color with a white head that lasted throughout. The nose is hops with some pine and citrus.

345,1005,biegaman,4.1,"Halloween 2007. Fresh growler fill via Consumer's Beverages on Elmwood, in Buffalo.  A stiff pour would conjure an average level of tanned white head. This would eventually fade in the middle, part strictly to the sides and then, after a good run, give out entirely around the halfway point of the pint. One element never compromised, however, is the colour; a toasted copper that glows ruby when examined at different angles, it is lovely-looking from each and every angle I inspect it.  The aroma is a fleshy concoction of zesty, eyebrow raising hops. Although C-hop dominated (meaning it boasts dynamic, domineering scents of pink grapefruit and pineapple), the bouquet also consists of rotting flowers, bubblegum, pine serum and a long list of other freshly squeezed citrus fruits. Despite all this the aroma is, believe or not, surprisingly balanced by a biscuity, toffee-like maltiness.  Hop Devil is liquid hop candy. Plain and simple. As well as overtones of spruce and pine, the flavour contains notes of grapefruit, pineapple, tangerine, lime, lychee and so on and so on and scooby-dooby doo. It is a citrus convention. But chaperoning all this are the aforementioned malts, which, if you care to notice, are bready and sweet (doubt you can though as the finish has an enduring mintiness).  Although almost 7%, the extra alcohol is, for the most part, unnoticed (and in any case the beer remains incredibly quaffable). It has a smoothing, toasty, biscuity maltiness as well as a leafy earthiness, the two infused and enlivened by well-integrated acidity. The bitterness seems to clamp onto the tongue for a long, rewarding aftertaste and really rams those pine-y, citrusy notes in.  Victory's Hop Devil was one of the first American IPAs I tried (and consequently one of the first beers to turn me onto bombastic hoppiness). It has been around for some time and remains a wonderful IPA, arguably still among the best the East Coast has to offer in the style. Right down the checklist, it fits all the criteria. It is, without doubt, a first-ballot Hall-of-Famer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,MMAJYK,3.82,"A- Looks between medium and dark brown. Head is small and not really thick. No lines down the glass while drinking. All reminents of head are gone.  S- Smells of oak and nuts. And a piney, citrus hop smell.  T- Somewhat bitter but enough to keep you interested. Has a kind of burnt wood taste in the end while bitter. Pretty strong alcohol taste too.  M- Nothing special. No maltiness or fizz to the mouth. Not too much here I would have to say. Not this beer's strong point.  D- Somewhat drinkable, but not an all nighter. The bitterness gets to you after one or two, but all in all is a good ale.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,nickfl,4.03,"A - Slightly hazy copper-orange with a rocky three finger head that leaves behind sticky, sea-foam like lace.  S - Pungent, lemony hop character with some nutty malt. Grapefruit, pine, and some caramel; you can tell there are a lot of hop oils in this.  T - A lot of bready malt, followed closely by pine and citrus. I get a little bit of mustard, maybe some pepper, and alcohol warmth towards the end. The finish is all bitterness, and it lingers.  M - Medium to slightly thick body with moderately high carbonation.  D - Drinkability is hard to judge on this one. It is quite bitter, beyond the point of being refreshing IMO, but they squeeze a lot of flavor from the hops as well. I can't see myself drinking more than one in a sitting, but the six pack won't last long. Overall, another winner from victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Overlord,3.5,"Pours a muddy copper colored hue. Nice inch high head, good lacing.  Smell, and taste, is pure hops. Some grapefruit , some grassy flavoring ...maybe a bit of pine. No real malt or fruit flavors to balance it out.  Considering that I loved, loved, loved the Hop Wallop, I was expecting to enjoy this more. It's a good beer, but for a ""hop bomb"" it lacks the complexity or drinkability of the Ballast Point or Stone brews I keep returning to.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

A hint of pepper.  Pepper and pine again, with lots of citric acid rush the palate, backed by a hearty dose of caramel malt that leaves a chewy, smooth mouthfeel.

A: Characterized by a blurry copper hue with a cream-white head that holds well.  S: Can you say hops? They certainly take center stage, but the sweet and spicy malt aroma is not to be forgotten.  T: Strong. Unapologetic. This is a full scale, in your face, citric hop blast. Similarly to the aromas, there are malts here, and they keep the beer as balanced as possible given the tons of hops here!  M: Smooth and creamy with just about the perfect amount of carbonation.

Smell is mild cracker-malty background, with hints of chocolate and soy-sauce, all loaded with plenty of herbal hops.  Taste is up-front herbal hops, metallic hops, pine hops (notably absent from the smell) and bittering hops. The malt notes present in the smell are steamrolled in the taste by the hop load.

Combination of spicy and grapefruit hops in the aroma, with a substantial malt presence backing them up.  Same as the aroma, a very big hop presence. It has a nice malty presence, possibly a bit nutty. Despite that this is not a balanced IPA, and that is why I like it ... its big on the hops.  Creamy mouthfeel, but light and dry.

345,1005,ojiikun,3.92,"American standard 12oz bottle from a sixpack picked up at Food Hole. Bottle suggests I drink before Jan '08, but it's not clear when the brew was born. Poured into a nice, big wineglass.  Head is noticable restrained, even after the vigorous pour. Body is quite dark and a good medium amber, neither yellow nor red. What little head there is is also quite dark for this style. Lace is good and sticky.  Aroma is pure hop, on the fruity side (as opposed to piney or floral). Some suggestions of chocolatey malting and good fresh cracked grains. Just a little honey, again with hints of something smokey underneath. Booze is only barely noticable.  Taste is alphas! Nowher near as full in body as the smell suggests, this is crisp and bitter. Hops even tone down a bit before the acids, getting a bit saltier and even peppery. Body is decidedly smooth and blends the darker malts with a good deal of nondescript lighter ones.  Feels really creamy on the tongue, combined with the nearly tingling acids. Not as sticky as you suspect. Not terribly carbonated, unfortunately.  The shining star of this brew is the smell. A good solid presentation of hops and malts, balanced in a war for your attention. The actual taste doesn't quite live up to the fanfare, but it's a great drink nonetheless - not quite as savoury as some other american IPAs.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Smell of these hops are pretty strong as I was able to get a whiff during the pour. Smells yummy.  T- Obviously the taste is full of dry hops. Last night I reviewed a Stone's IPA and I feel like this one is a little less hoppy than that one. Don't get me wrong, this is a nice IPA though.  M- Medium carbonation but little tingling left in my mouth that you usually get from a hoppy IPA. Still nice.  D- This is a nice, close-to sessional as I can get.

The white head is a good inch thick when poured before settling to a nice surface coating along with some very good lacing on the inside of my glass. Fruity aromas of grapefruit and citrus are present along with hops of course. The aromas are that strong overall though. Tastewise there is some malty sweetness and hop bitterness along with the aforementioned fruity flavors of citrus and grapefruit. The hops are slightly more dominant than the other flavors, but not that by much. Has a crisp and frothy, full bodied mouthfeel with moderate to heavy carbonation. Easy to drink in the way good beers should be. This is certainly a good beer, but overall it reminded me more of an APA than an IPA.

Then a herbal bitterness of grass and pine comes in midway, leaving a a bit of an after taste. A medium bodied feel is consistant all the way through, but it does leave an oily feel at the back end. This is a very easy to drink beer, impressive in the flavor and aroma, though the feel was very good, the oily texture was a sligtht tyrn off. This is is still an excellent beer, I just want to go get another one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

A hint of sweetness in the back, but this one's all about the hops.  T: The hops hit you up front and stay with you for a while. Nice citrus flavor and taste to it. A bit of sweetness comes through. Alcohol is well hidden. This is very balanced for a highly hopped beer.  M: Smooth, good carbonation.  D: This is a great standard IPA that I could definitely see putting back on a routine basis. Definitely recommended if you dig IPAs.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,blackheartbilly,4.3,"Funny story, one night after a very long pub crawl I stole a pint glass from a certain bar in Allston. It was a Hop Devil glass. Recently I found a place that sells it in Plymouth, and I poured a 12 ounce bottle into my liberated Hop Devil pint glass.  A - Copper, but almost orange in appearance. There wasn't much of a head and couldn't any head at the half glass mark.  S - Obviously heavy hop presence, fruity and maybe a wee bit of a malt smell.  T - The aftertaste of hops over-shadowed any of the malt that I thought I tasted. I thought this was very strong for what I thought was a normal IPA. Then I saw the 6.7% ABV, great taste, alcohol does not overpower the wondeful hop aftertaste, cascade hops maybe?  M - Not too acidic, but very strong for an IPA. Sort of bitter, but in a good way.  D - I will buy this again. I am recently buying more IPAs because they don't make me feel as full as the stouts and porters I usually like. Definitely try this IPA, even though it can be hard to find.

The hops is powerful up front and it moves to a citric taste of sorts, but the hops is a devil and I guess for my pallette so far it's just a bit overpowering.  Trying to keep in mind the style that the brewer was going for I'd have to say they achieved it. It's a good IPA and probably a stand out for the style but not up to what I'm ready for and I found it to be a little hard to handle.  I put my scores the way I did to reflect it's keeping with the style not my own personal tastes but I would say I'm not planning on revisiting this particular beer until I've had some more IPA experience and think I'm ready for a hoppier product",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,americanwolfdrea,3.13,"This beer was a little to heavy for my personbal taste. It was also a bit too bitter because of the heavy level of hops in it.

T - Bitter, with a nice citrus/acidic flavor. Malt was present, gave the beer a good body that complimented the hops well. The aftertaste was of citrus, like a tangerine, with some floral hints and of course hops.  M - Nice crisp full body. The beer felt somewhat heavy for an IPA but was a nice change of pace, I think the haze of the beer made it feel more like a heff in my mouth but still had the refreshing attributes I look for in an IPA.  D - I could deffinetly drink this again. I would like to try it on tap sometime to compare the difference between my bottle and draft (or cask).  My bottle had a ""drink by"" date of Oct 20 2007.

345,1005,akorsak,4.57,"A pint glass hand-pulled at the brewery in Downingtown, PA.  A: The ale is a brilliant amber color, the color that all good beer should aspire to, dark and mysterious but light enough to allow you to peer through it as you ponder its greatness. Capping off this magnificence is a billowy white head, full of dense bubbles that lasts nicely through the pint.  S: The nose has the big bite of HopDevil mixed with a creamy maltiness. The hops are still big and bold though, make no mistake about it.  T: The taste nicely combines the big hops with a subtlety that comes from the cask. The hop body is still big and American, grapefruit with an earthy undertone, but it was relaxed a bit, taking on a softer more concentrated body. The creamy head atop the beer is a sweetness that matches the grainy biscuit body nicely. The hops deliver a long biting finish that remains bitter long after the sip is a memory.  M: The cask has smoothed out the beer, mellowing the hops and accentuating the malts. The effect is a great drink, smooth and bitter.  D: HopDevil on cask was a revelation, robust and delicious.

Appearance: Poured a hazy bronze color, small carbonation bubbles rising inside. The head formed about one finger thick and retained nicely.  Aroma: The hops dominate nicely, in the background lurk some sweet and bready malts too. Very enticing.  Taste: As one would expect with a name like this, the hops dominate from beginning to end. At the start it's more floral with some citrus in the background. A malty sweetness is there as well. Towards the middle and end, the hoppiness becomes more citrus and bitter, and by the finish it's mostly grapefruit, a little spicy too. The sweet malt taste lingers a little before getting pushed out of the way by the hops.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth and creamy, medium to full body. The carbonation balanced very nicely.

Aroma is fruity and flowery, with hints of syrup and citrus.  The flavor is a blast of American hops, oily to the taste and dry to the finish. But there's also a substantial malt presence to this brew which balances it out nicely. A nice molasses flavor cuts into the bitterness with some force. Mouthfeel is very dry in the finish. This beer is a bit filling, but tasty enough not to let that slow you down. Overall a very good IPA from Victory.

Taste was good, mild hops for a beer named HopDevil. A bit restrained for my liking. Pretty malty...reminded me of a Bass on some hormones. Dry-hop finish. My wife liked it more than me.  I have had this beer a few times in the bottle and was not impressed. Last night proved to me that I am not a fan.

Taste begins with piny hops, then centers on the sweet caramel, then finishes cleanly with the hops again. Light, fizzy carbonation on the front of the tongue; complements flavors well.

T: Starts off very smooth and creamy, almost easy-drinking, but then the bite of the hops kicks in, very nice and complex. Enough soft malts to keep everything in balance.

345,1005,Dalem,3.95,"The aroma of oranges and caramel was different than what I usually smell had me intrigued right off the bat. Neither of them overpowering the other like they are in some kind of perfect harmony. I found the darkish orange color of it interesting too. Yeah, such a shade is expected in an IPA but there is something a little more eye catching about it here. It's bitter but not that way too much pucker, the taste of lemon peel and caramel letting it go down smooth. The hops linger leaving a nice little twang in the mouth once it's down the throat but not anything shouting too loud ""I'm 6.7% abv"" the way a bunch of others do. Nice medium body...not too fizzy nor too oily. The only complain I have is the name Hop Devil itself. After all it's got a hop bud fancied as a devil's face on the label. Off the name alone I was expecting something a bit more over the top and maybe a belly ache/esophagus fire the next day like a Two Hearted Ale (which are a treat once every few month or so but I still would prefer not get stuck with entirely for an evening cuz after a few they fall under the ""a bit too much"" category for me) or the ""This rules but where is the fine line between it and barley wine?"" thing of Hop Slam (Yeah...I realize I used tow different things Bell's makes as my reference point. Hey! I'm Michigan born and raised! Homeland pride brothers and sisters!!!) at first and that was what I was prepared for. I don't feel let down at all that this is a bit more mellow than that...An almost perfect mellow as a matter of fact....A mellow that I can share with friends who are even of the too much persuasion as well as those that like the bite. No matter the season either.

The head is a nice two fingers that slowly works its way back into the body of the beer as you let the ale breathe. The color is a redish amber and the carbonation trails are a sight to behold.  The smell is a floral, piney scent. Best sampled after poured and settled.  The mouthfeel is just right. Not too much carbonation which can cause a burning sensation. This ale is smooth to the palate and leaves a nice after taste. No stale beer breath with this brew.  This beer is a great beer for drinking with good friends and family. Everyone that I have introduced to this ale went out the next day and bought a case.

Mouthfeel: It's very smooth and will leave that hop taste lingering around your mouth for a bit.  Drinkiness: I could drink this all day and all night.

Aromas thick with grapefruit and sweet malty balance intertwined with a solid bready, yeasty goodness. Hardly shy on the palate, this one is smooth on the tongue with fantastic flavors of citrus and breadiness that cannot be beat. Spicy finish with a balancing malty sweetness. Perhaps the creme de la creme of beers: balanced, aromatic, flavorful, and not too high in alcohol. Certainly, IMHO, far better on cask than in bottle or on tap elsewhere than the brewpub itself.

Smell - Sweet malts dominate the nose a little more, with a slight alchohol burn somewhere up in the sinus. Hops are present, but a little subdued for an american IPA. Notes of lemon zest and other citrus.  Taste - Malty base is quickly over powered by an intense, but not overly so, bitterness. Caramel, citrus, burnt pineaple, and piney resins are all quite strong. More hoppy than the last time I tried this beer. Quite good.  Mouthfeel - Slick and oily, with a nice light carbonation.  Drinkability - Instead of crafting a monster of an IPA, the relative weekness makes this a more sessionable AIPA.

Flavor: Very nice caramel and hints of biscuit malt flavor. Huge hop flavor that is spicey and grassy. Has a decent bitter after bite that lingers a bit and makes you take another sip to put out the ""fire."" The bitterness is not overly cloying. Slight alcohol but almost totally masked.  Mouthfeel: On the high side of medium bodied. Slick on the tongue. Perfect CO2.  Overall Impression: A perfectly balanced India Pale Ale. This one is not overly done on the hop bitterness at all.

Smell: More of a malty smell here with little touches of sweetness and notes of prunes and currants. Not too terribly potent but apparent none the less.  Taste and Mouthfeel: This beer oddly reminds me or raisin bran which is a cereal I enjoy quite a bit. Up front there's some semi sweet, but rich malts lending a smooth mouthfeel to the beer with just a sting of hop bitterness. These flavors soon transfer to more of a sun dried raisin flavor. The finish is pretty clean and there are some minor apricot notes in to the aftertaste.  Drinkability: It's about as drinkable as any other IPA really. There's really nothing especially good or bad about this brew.  Bottom Line: This beer seems to get quite a bit of hype in my opinion but I think it's just kind of your average good IPA.

Still a good hop flavor, though. The feel is moderate and has a creamy texture, there is a bitterness that kind of numbs the palate.

The head forms slowly and you can tell this is a thick and bitter beer; the head is nice leaving a good solid lace around the glass. Aroma is pure pine needles and brown sugar with earthy and bitter hops dominating the smell. Taste is bitter with the hops dominating this sweet, caramel-like brew, also hints of over-ripe orange. Finishes oily with a nice residual bitterness so you know you've been drinking an IPA.  All in all, a great beer I'll have a again.

345,1005,Contra,4.15,"12 oz. bottle, ""drink before Oct 25 07""  Hop Devil is a nice balance between hoppyness and drinkability. All the floral/pine flavors are there, but the body is light enough that it goes down easily. The appearance is nothing notable - low carbination, but a ring of foam around the perimeter of the glass. The aroma is also somewhat low key, but it's certainly better than average. The taste, however, is where this beer shines. As mentioned before, there is the typical floral/pine flavor, but with the right amount of bitterness. The body is fairly medium, but sticky enough to be called slightly chewy. The nice thing about HopDevil is that it is smooth enough to be refreshing, but complex enough to keep you wanting more. A well balanced beer.  Overall, HopDevil is an excellent choice at a bargain price (at least where I got it). It's hoppy enough to frighten the weaker beers away, but light enough to be more refreshing than the Double IPAs.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

I did not write a review cause I thought I must have a bad batch. 4 weeks later I buy another sixer. Same crap! This time I did a blind taste test with Broken Halo, Avery IPA, Great Divide IPA, and this mess. I could pick this thing out blindfolded every time, and not for good reasons. It looks good nice color and head. But that is where good ends and bad to worse starts. It smells like a decent IPA with malts and lots of hops but then a whiff of, (I don't know what) hits me. I really don't know what to call it, plastic? or soap. Whatever the smell is it is even more prevalent in the taste. A very distinctive yuck aftertaste. To its credit the beer is much better as it warms but I will be very gun shy about trying another.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,robocrouch,4.05,A: Poured from the bottle into a pint glass with a very deep brown color with a decent white head. Some lace.  S: This beer smells really good. Sour grapefruit and some sweet fruit and fresh hops are present.  T: The hops are the stars in this beer. You get hit with a wide array of varying hop flavors. This beer kicks your ass but is still sweet enough to put a smile on your face. The one thing that to me is amazing is how creamy it is for such a hoppy beer.  D: Overall a great beer that does the style justice. Highly Recommended.  Two Thumbs Up,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,jackhig,4,"Poured amber into imperial pint glass. White head dissapates but good lacing intact. Hops come out in the smell but not as strong as the name would suggest. Very well balanced in the taste, huge hops with enough malt to get you through to the sweet aftertaste. At 6.7% these might be a little too easy to drink.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,OWSLEY069,4,"Pours a nice deep amber color with a nice big white head. In the aroma it has hops and faint smell of alcohol. It has the a big hop presence and a spicy, abrasive malt characteristic. This was the first IPA I ever drank on a regular basis, and I remember saying to my girlfriend (now wife) ""I will not marry a girl unless she likes Hop Devil"" Guess what we drank at our wedding?!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,bosco7,4.2,"Copper color with a fluffy white head. Lacing that is as thick as the head.  Lots of orange and pine resin in the nose. Malt aromas present but understated.  A flash of nutty/carmely/biscuity malt flavors that finishes with candied orange, grapefruit rind, and earthy pine cone. Noticeably high IBUs. Very tasty.  Medium body with an oily mouthfeel from hops. Nicely carbonated.  Good IPA probably the best I have had that was made east of the Rockies. Nice balance, flavor, and drinkability. Worth trying.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,khiasmus,3.63,"A- Reddish copper with 2 1/2 fingers of head after a hard pour into my goblet. head retains pretty well and laces a bit, and the beer is absolutely clear.  S- Grapefruity and piney hops supported by some grain smell and caramel malt. There is an almost strawy note in there as well that I've never smelled before in an American IPA.  T- Caramel-sweet the whole time it's in your mouth, again with the strawy, bready flavor. As soon as it leaves an area on your tongue, though, the hop devil does his dirty work, leaving a decently intense bitterness behind. Gets lower marks here because an IPA really should be more balanced toward the hops. Not more bitter (don't hear what I'm not sayin!) but balanced, in the flavor, towards hops. This one is only hoppy in the finish, the flavor is all sweet and caramelly. However, the finish is HOPPY, and not just in hop flavor, but strong bitterness. This is not for the average beer drinker, but the hop lover. :-)  M- Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation, but a lot of astringency left by the hops along with their bitterness.  D- I find it quite drinkable, but I'm a hophead. If you like balanced beers, this one is good, but you have to stand up to the bitter hop oil finish. I'll buy it again though. cheers.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Appearance: Medium-dark amber, slightly hazy, leaves excellent lacing. Taste: Loads of bitterness paired nicely with a dark crystal maltiness, but weak on hop flavor. Excessively earthy. Drinkability: Medium light mouthfeel. Great balance of hops and maltiness makes for a good example of an American style IPA.

Aromas of hops and some malt. Plenty of citric hop bitterness in the flavor balanced with some malt then the hops have the final say in the finish.

345,1005,eberkman,3.95,"Pours a deep, clear copper with a one-finger, creamy off-white head that keeps its shape and leaves rings of lacing. The smell is mostly hops with some floral and citric notes poking through. Taste is tangy, subtly sweet maltiness up front giving away to a long, bitter finish. Some citrus fruit mixed in with the malts, but not as grapefruity as others. The bitterness takes over to dominate in a big way, however, about halfway through -- almost on the level of a Smutty or a Bell's 2-Hearted. The mouthfeel is dry and quenching, not overly carbonated, but somewhat thinner than I would have expected. Decent drinkability for the ABV. Would also pair well with spicy foods.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,jjayjaye,4,"Pours a slightly hazy amber orange color with a shallow head that fades fairly quickly to surface but is kept alive by substantial effervescence. Some lacing observed.  The smell is aggressive fresh hopped pine and grapefruit.  Medium bodied, the mouth feel has a nice malty beginning with a balanced hop character which is followed by a second stage of bitterness in the finish.  The flavor is a refreshing grapefruit that leaves a slight floral after taste.  Quite drinkable; another nice beverage from Victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,jspruit,4.27,"Got a small sample of this beer after a night of drinking Sprite since I was the DD for the party that I was with at Rhino's in Martin (of all the places in the world.)  Poured a light copper body (even though I didnt have too much) with a small white head that stuck around for a bit. Smells are of strong hops as I would expected that made my mouth water to try it. The first taste that hits your mouth was the hops, with some bitterness on the finish-pretty continuous throughout the sample. I had heard about this brewery before and was pleasantly suprised to see it on tap in such a small bar and although my sample was small as well it fulfilled my expectations-I would like to try again under different circumstances as I think that this could be a great hoppy beer that I could have over and over again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Absumaster,4.29,"An amber, orange beer with sparkling carbonation and a thin head, which forms a ring on the edge of the glass.  Smell is dextrinous and malty with a resinous and grapefruity hop punch. It smells like a nicely balanced beer.  Taste is bitter, but not too bitter. It is balanced by a big dextrinous malt taste, which makes the beer a little sweet and sticky. The hops are grapefruity and have a slight lemon taste. Half way down the glass, bitterness has overtaken the beer and the malt flavors are pushed behind. Bitterness lingers together with the dextrines.  I finally start to understand IPAs better now, but still I feel differences between them are quite small between a high ranked beer and a 'mediocre' beer. This was a good beer though.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,jomo,3.68,"Appearance is a nice burnt orange with a decent light tan head. A little cloudy.  Smell is malty sweet. A little citrus and hops. Kinda weak.  Taste is similar to smell. A bitter finish.  Mouthfeel is good. Viscosity is appropriate. Carbonation is aggressive but bubbles are small.  This is a pretty easy drinker except for the bitter finish.  I must say that this is not the kind of IPA I am used to. A bit maltier. Not as citrusy/piney as I would like. The hops don't seem to show up except for bitterness. At the same time, this is a pretty easy drinker. Solid, easy, but not great.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,RunawayJim,4.15,"As this is one of my favorite IPA's, I figured I needed to make another review of it for the serving type I normally get... the bottle.  Poured into a standard pint glass, it's a deep amber color, and a bit cloudy as well. The carbonation can be seen rising to the top. The beer poured with a thick 1.5 finger white-ish tan head that hung around for a bit and then slowly shrank. The beer leaves lots of lacing on the glass.  It smells mostly of citrusy piney hops, not much else can be detected. You can tell just from the smell that this will be a hoppy beer.  The beer immediately tastes of those hops and has a bit of a bite to it at the start, but the flavor gets a little more balanced as you go down, but it's pretty much all hops all the way. It leaves a very strong hoppy aftertaste. You can feel the carbonation in your mouth.  The drinkability takes a bit of a cut on this one, mainly because of the super duper hops bite, but also because of the carbonation, which seems a little more on the excessive side.  I previously reviewed this beer on cask. The bottled version is nowhere near as smooth and tastes a bit hoppier than from the cask, but that does not make this an undrinkable brew. This is still a top notch IPA, and as with most Victory beers, it doesn't disappoint.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,treehugger02010,3.4,"I got this in a 12 ounce cup at the Wachovia Center. I was suprised when I saw a Victory stand and was shocked that this would be at a basketball game. It poured a deep yet light brown color with no head at all. There was however, a fair amount of lacing all the way down. The smell had a nice hop smell and the taste had lingers of the same. There was a bit of a bite to the mouthfeel that I didn't really like that much. For the most part this was a just above average beer. Don't drink and review.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,BurnsTau,4.4,"Pours amber/copper, a bit hazy with great white head and lacing.  Tastes is definitely about the hops, bitter and strong. Some maltiness in there sweetens it up a bit and creates enough balance to be very enjoyable, but you know it's about the hops with this beer. So much flavor it compares to a dIPA more than just an IPA. Very good beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Chaz,4.02,"Brassy, golden-amber in color, and brilliant. Poured from a freshly-tapped keg, this was served with a one and a half fingered pale tan head, with moderate lacing and duration. Piney, resiny hops on the nose, with just a touch of biscuit and caramel in the malt profile. Spicey hops are all over the first sip, and the mouthfeel seems fairly light and cleansing. Mild, lingering bitterness with toasted malts almost floating above the aromatic and bittering hops. Not a small beer and not a big beer, but right in-between, and the alcohol is very well hidden. Semi-sweet, with a nice juicy malt quality registering about halfway through the palate. Medium bodied, and much more well-balanced than I recall it being from the last bottle I enjoyed. Plenty of dryness. A fine American IPA, and very consistent.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Also, there's a fruitiness to it, but beyond some peaches its more of a vague fruitiness for me, like standing with your back to a fruit platter at a party.  Taste: Soft flavors throughout, be it the toasty malts, grapefruit, or the single drop of caramel sweetness, and though the finish is light in its bitterness, there is an acidic flare-up right on the swallow.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, with a lively carbonation. Slight warmth from the alcohol.  Drinkability: Overall, its a fairly easygoing IPA, with none of the flavors ever really pronouncing themselves, leaving the experience a bit lacking.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Taste: It tastes much like it smells. A bit of a pine flavor with a hoppy bitter aftertaste, very flavorful.  Mouthfeel: A very nice mouthfeel, the bubbles aren't to large or too frequent or the reverse.  Drinkability: Very easy to drink, I enjoy this one a lot.

Smell is big sweet hops, with very grassy and earthy characteristics.  Taste is much like the smell, grassy hops with deep earthy feel. Sizable bitterness follows with a bready aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy, perfect for the style.  Drinkability is good, lots of bitter hops but very tasty.  Overall a very good IPA.

A: Poured into a flared pint glass, the flare cradles a beautiful 2.5 finger tan head that rises to a convex cap above the rim. Nice dark gold/amber color. A thing of beauty. Sticky webby lace adorns the glass, trailing downwards to a cap of foam that never goes away.  S: Citrus, hop resin, pine, orange, grapefruit  T: Gorgeous balance, citrusy hops give way to a flash of toasty malt before transforming into a refreshing bitterness that lingers but is not overpowering.  M: Sticky delicious hops give this beer a thicker mouthfeel than lots of other IPAs, it works well here. No trace of alcohol flavor, perfect carbonation.  D: Stellar.

345,1005,trevorwideman,4,"12oz bottle courtesy of fisherman34, thanks Kris! Poured into a pint glass.  Vigorous pour reveals a full inch of head, lots of webby lacing. Mild, lazy carbonation floats though a dark coppery-red brew. A bit of chill haze as well. Smell is full of floral and citrus hops, but they don't overwhelm the generous biscuity and bready malt aromas that linger in the nose. Great balance, very lovely aroma on the whole.  Taste is piney off the top, then mellows a bit into the more floral aspects. Acidity is less citric than sprucey. Herbal and curative in its assertiveness. Highly acidic, this is a bit of a palate-scorcher to be sure. Toasty caramel maltmakes an entrance in the background, along with a bit of vanilla and yeasty breadiness, but the malt is definitely playing second violin here. Less balanced than I would have hoped, but it's not a huge criticism really. Mouthfeel is buzzy due to the high acid levels, not so much from the carbonation, which is medium at best. Medium body, nice and sticky going down. This is drinkable, but in small sips and you want to savour every one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

The hops are serious but the malt backbone really keeps the hops in check. I'm glad to see the alcohol level is fairly low, which makes this ipa very drinkable.

Appearance - Lovely dark red/orange color, very unique for an IPA. Also has a nice deep off-white head, good start.  Smell - Hops, Hops, Hops mixed in with a little citrus and darker fruits. This is the first time you get a taste of the very raw flavor.  Taste - A lot deeper flavor than most IPA's, has a very raw sense. The hops dominate but there's also a nice citrus tone as well as some other semi-dark fruits. The hops are amazing, really leaving a great bitter aftertaste which sits extremely well.  Mouthfeel - The consistency is extremely good and the texture is definetly thicker than most IPA's as it seems very malty. Very unique and cool  Drinkability - Love this brew a lot, can't go wrong with Victory. Definetly provides a great compairson to Stone to show the West Coast vs. East Coast style IPA's. This East coaster with it's raw characteristics and darker style definetly holds it's own. That being said, I gotta give the edge to Stone (which surprised me since I consider Victory one of my hometown brews and was prepared to give them the local edge).

When imbibed, noticed a firm malt-base and finished with a moderate bitter kick that lingered. Had a creamy mouthfeel.  I am not sure about everyone else but this came across as more of an English IPA then American. I say so due to the more balanced flavor of the brew (malt), reminded me a lot of McEwan's IPA (which I have read is a repackaged Special Import).

There's a sturdy caramel malt backbone here with slightly toasty and nutty flavors. Very little pine resin - hard to tell if it's really there or if I merely expect it to be.  Mouthfeel is a mouthcoating creamy medium with a hint of warming in the throat.  Drinkability is not as impressive as Stone's IPA but this is certainly easy to drink.  Very good IPA.

As far as taste goes this brew lives up to its name. There is plenty of bitterness to go around. There isn't a whole lot as far as malt goes with this one, you know you're drinking an IPA. This beer is medium bodied. The alcohol warms the mouth and leaves a tingling for quite some time. It goes down about as easily as any other beer of comparable style and abv.  I don't know why but I was not impressed by this beer. Being an IPA lover I was encouraged by other reviews and very excited to try this. I don't know if I got a bad batch (I know it was fresh, there is a date and it was in the cooler) or if this one just doesn't suit my fancy. I do plan on giving this beer another shot in the future.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,stevehagy,4.2,"When poured in glass you get a light brown color with a hint of red that is hazy. Staying true to its name, the aroma is hoppy as with the taste. The aftertaste is very bitter and hoppy as well. Carbonation isnt very strong which fits it perfectly. Drinkability not as high as others because of the bitter hoppiness which doesnt always settle well.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,prototypic,4.17,"Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy copper color with a very nice one-finger foamy head. Good retention and very nice lacing remains on the mug.  Smell: Very citrusy and hoppy. Nice combination of grapefruit, orange, and perhaps a little mango. Hops smell of straight pine. A bit more of a malty smell than I expected.  Taste: Grapefruit taste provides a sweet element. Very bitter hop kick after the sweetness subsides a little. The bitterness is excellent here. It is balanced out a little by the malt, but it's definitely got a kick.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Medium bodied and pretty easy to drink. I'd happily take down a few. Carbonation and abv perfect for this beer. Overall, this is a really good IPA. Highly recommended.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

A-Beautiful red tinted brown with a thick fluffy head that is constantly replensished by a cascade of bubbles.  S-Flowery hops, maybe some malt. more English smelling than American  T-Nicely rounded. There is the grassy hops with a notable malt backbone. The finish is dry, with a medicinal/grass bitterness lingering. The hop flavour is different than the west coast IPA's i have been drinking. I didnt think i would like this as much as i do. This is a good tasting beer  M-Slightly on the lighter side with a healthy dose of carbonation.  D-This is a tasty drink that i will order from fresh direct again. A very interesting IPA, I would lean towards calling it an East Coast American IPA if that were a category. The brews on the west coast tend to have a stronger pine taste. Closer to Englan I suppose.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Smells like . . .citrus, lemon or lime stand out with some piney after notes. Mouthfeel is slightly thick. Big hop flavor, almost consumes this entire beer but there is a malt backbone towards the middle and then finishes a touch dry with the pine flavor lingering. Bitterness suites the style.

It looks good, much more red in color than the IPA I tried before. Almost looks like a completely different style of beer when you have the two side by side. Good looking creamy head that hangs around for a while. The smell is more malty than hoppy to be honest. I'm wondering where the hops went. Taste is also lacking that crisp hop kick that I've accustomed myself to. They are there but well covered by a malty sweetness. It kinds of seems slightly watered down a little. Not sure what the deal is here. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy and I can get a better sense of the hops. Solid. Pretty drinkable beer in the end. It doesn't stand up to what I drank before it but I can't complain. Well, one complaint. It was a dollar more...which I couldn't come to understand at $4.50.

If a hop cut a fart, I guess this is what it would smell like?  it taste pretty good, I'd rather pay the buck extra and get a six of Stone IPA, but I didn't feel cheated for buying this beer.  it has a little more carbination (champagne type bubbling) than I expected but went down easy enough without a sting or bitter bite.  I could drink this beer, I won't knock anyone down at the counter to buy it, but I would buy it again to support the brewery (I like some of their other offerings) and 'Regular-Guy America'...

345,1005,MiguelMandingo,4.13,"Hey everyone this is my first review. I thought this would be a good beer to review first since I drink this beer so often. Admittedly, I would have liked to sampled more beers in this style to get a feel for them before reviewing this one in particular, as I do not know if HopDevil is a good representation of an American IPA... oh well.  Let me start by saying that I really like this beer. It is easy for me to drink several of these without thinking twice about it. Definitely my favorite from Victory Ale at this point in time.  Poured from a bottle into my Gingerman pint glass.  Appearance - A mix of bronze/copper/liquid brown sugar in color. White head with a little bit of lacing. The head retention isn't as long I would prefer - but a little swirl of the glass brings it right back.  Smell - Not much smell to speak of, just a touch of hops and some spice I can't really describe.  Taste - A citrus hops bite, a sweet malt middle and the hops comes right back at the end.  Mouthfeel - a medium thickness without being syrupy. Not as carbonated as other beers I have had, which may contribute to how quickly I can drink one of these.  Drinkability - Easy. This is my session beer. And yes, I think I will have another...",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Body is very translucent and a yeasty haze can be seen moving around the glass.  S-Citrus (mostly grapefruit) hops dominate the nose with some spicy hops in the background.  T- Initial flavor is somewhat subtle and offers some grapefruity hop flavor and a sound but very subtle caramel malt backing. Refreshing piny hops come through for the finish and the citrus hops intensify. Fruity flavors include lemon and grapefruit. Aftertaste is bittersweet in every sense of the meaning. Medium hop bitterness lingers along with a sweet bready malt, and both piny and citrus hop flavor.  M-great mouthfeel medium body with light carbonation. Body is very smooth and creamy-easy to swallow.  D-This is a great IPA and much more complex than most. HopDevil was my very first IPA (if you read the unedited review you could probably tell) and I really didn't appreciate how good it was then.

345,1005,mobud,3.42,"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Nice copper color with a medium head that remained thru the sample. The smell has traces of hops and sweetness, but they are slight and not what you would expect for a beer called HopDevil. The taste was even for my liking. This beer was hoppy before the rise of hopbombs, but now it is middle of the road. Enough resin is there to coat your mouth, but not enough to burn like others. The mouthfeel is thick for my liking, with a malt aftertaste on the back of my throat.

Clear reddish copper color with a nice, frothy, light tan head. Head recedes to a ring and a thin layer of bubbles on the surface. Some soapy looking lacing is left behind.  The smell is a good mixture of sweet, caramel malts and zesty grapefruit hops. Some flowery herbs float in and out, as well.  Zesty, peppery, herbal hop bite leads into the sweeter malt. Bitter hops sting comes back at the finish.  Mouthfeel is a bit soapy. I don't remember that from before. Dry and bitter aftertaste.

T/M: Sweet caramel malt up front, leafy hoppiness. Bit of toasted grain. Very long bitter tail, retains some sweetness. Mouthfeel is on the dry side. Would make a great sidekick to pub fare. Overall, nothing really dominates -- everything plays well together.  D: I drank this pretty quickly. And yeah, I'd have another.

Aroma is a nice combination of hops and malt sweetness. Very balanced IPA I thought- tons of hops - herbal and piney and grapefruit but also a strong backbone. Finishes dry as it should for an IPA.

Hints of pine as well as some fruity esters. Sweet toffee induced malts. Flower aromas overwhelm all other contenders.  The flowery, flowered, flowers of hops leads over to the taste. Albeit not overly bitter and well balanced by the semi sweet toffee malt. Light citrus approach with undescernible notations.  Mouth is medium bordering on thin.

The aroma is a bit lacking in the head but does have a nice hoppy undertone that is sweet but not quite citrus. I just found myself wishing for a more dominate smell of hops.  This IPA I found had a more roasted flavor than I am used to in the style. A nice change from the ordinary. Good amount of carbonation giving it a medium body that left with a strong bitter finish. Thoughts of oranges came to mind, with a slite alcoholic taste that is more masked by the hops and malts.  I quite enjoyed this beer and would pick up another six pack when able. I would also be interested in trying this one on tap.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

The nose of this beer I find lacking a bit for an IPA. Not much hops present in the smell but I did catch a hint of a dark plum and some bready overtones.  First sip brought me right back to the fact that this is definitely an IPA. Starts of with a crisp malt backbone, dry, bready and well balanced. This is definitely more of a ""dry"" ipa with little sweetness in the malt.  There are mostly bittering hops in this one, but perfectly balanced with the malt it makes for a nice platform to show off the hoppy finish which stays with you for a while. Peppery, spicy hops, no real citrus to speak of.  Overall a VERY balanced IPA with a perfect amount of carbonation and a great hop finish.

Needs to be stronger in the nose. I was trying to compare this and the weyerbacher Simcoe but that won't work. It is a beer by itself. Initially sweet then bitter then sweet then bitter again. Not a lot of citrus flavor but there is a blackness that must be roasted malt and very black tasting hops. I like this take on the IPA. Very different from most IPA's I have had.

345,1005,Jwaks,3.73,"Serving 12oz  Fine wisps of carbonation lazily float upwards though a pellucid pale bronze body to meet a frothy collar encirlcing a thin, patchy brown tinted head.  Mild grapefruit and juicy orange flirt with caramel malt aromas on the nose while whiffs of alcohol and fresh cut grass linger in the background.  Hard hitting hops smack the taste buds from the start to the bitter off-dry finish while restrained caramel malts smooth over and balance out the rough bitter citrus flavors. Piquant hop bitters, smooth malts and a bit of peppery alcohol tie it all together on a pleasant finish. Grassy bitter hops grip the palate for a good 20 seconds creating a dry, mildly grassy aftertaste. Hop bitterness is takes on an odd metallic, copper, and grassy flavors as the beer warms.  Bitterness and grassy hops dominate on the aftertaste while the malt backbone is well delinated yet not expertly integrated to make a uniform whole. A medium to full body lends a desireable mouthcoating character while hop bitters and malts work toward a harmonious balance. Additional carbonation would lift this beer's body up giving it a fuller more complete mouthfeel.  Easy down for a bitter beer with a respectable dose of alcohol. The dry, bitter finish keeps me going back for more.  Kudos to Victory for giving us another great brew!  Cheers!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

The taste starts with an even hit of malt and hops, grassy and kettle hops and /or citrus.At this time, the hops take immediate control over the ever present malts in the background, with a strong citrus regime, grapefruit/lemon.

T: First taste reveals a sharp, but manageable hop bite- not the kind of 'hop-bite' to cringe over. Malt is there somewhat to balance this beer, but the hops are certainly king. Aftertaste is mild. M: Smooth once the 'bite' leaves your tastebuds. This beer seems to smooth out even more as it warms. D: Very drinkable for hop fans, though I prefer to drink this one slowly while enjoying a good book or just kicking back after a hard week. I just don't see this as a typical session beer.

345,1005,jhicks12,4.2,"Appearance: Poured a nice clean amber color with a white lacy foam.  Smell: Nice citrus, flower, piney aroma.  Taste: Nice Piney oily hop taste. Very refeshing and clean.  Mouthfeel: Nice carbonation and good stinging hop feel.  Drinkability: Very nice solid IPA. Not too sweet or dry very flavorful. Great quality IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,foureyedgeek,4.43,"12 oz bottler with an 'Enjoy by Apr 28 07' date.  Pours a gorgeous clear amber wit 2 fingers of off-white foamy head, leaves clinging lacing, with great retention.  Smell is both sweet and hoppy, caramel and pine.  Mmm, so tasty, this is such a well balanced IPA, the sweet maltiness, caramel-toffee and that great citrus and pine hoppiness.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, lightly carbonated and slightly creamy.  Drinkability is huge. This beer is one of my favorites. I could, and have drink this all night!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,DevilDogBeer,4.07,"HopDevil pours from the tap a deep amber-red color with a white head. The consistency of the foam is creamy but not bitter, unfortunately it dies down to a thin film after a few sips. The smell is a hit of hops to the nose with a subtle caramel undertone. The taste is not overpowering and has a distinct hop taste on the front of the tongue and lingers with bitter notes in the aftertaste, though not at all unpleasant. The mouthfeel is a little above average due to the malt needed to balance out the high IBUs of the brew. Very drinkable as it is not heavy and does not impart a sour taste in the mouth, but at 6.7% ABV, moderation is golden! A great offering from Victory and the beer stands up to the hype with all of the awards it has garnered.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,IgnatiusReilly,4.25,"Off the cask at Standard Tap in Philly. This is the first time Ive had this beer off a hand-pump, and there is such a huge difference than out of a bottle or straight from the tap. Unbelievable.  Served at about 50-55 degrees, the appearance was a deep ruby amber. Full, thick and creamy head. Tons of retention and Belgian lace down the pint. Not quite as big a nose than from the tap, but still lots of citrus hop scents. The taste was next to perfect for an IPA. The higher serving temperature and lower carbonation allowed for an incredible mix of malt sweetness and spicy hop bitterness. Malt sweetness is bready, but the hops still dominate with a biting spiciness, with both grapefruit and pine flavors, followed by a lingering alcohol aftertaste. With such a smooth and chewy mouth-feel you can only get from beer from the engine, I wish all beers could be served this way.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,PEBKAC,3.83,"A soft, seafoam head & glowing, topaz body. A whiff takes in noticeable spiciness & citrus burn. The type of burn you'd get from Sunny Delight.  The taste is very malty, never for a moment without some of that Sunny Delight hopping along on its back. Quite the backseat driver actually. The aftertaste leaves a bit of roasted malt, with just a scrap of bitterness. Not much of anything lingers, which was part of the reason I had to drink the entire 12oz before I could even post the second sentence.  If this isn't your first experience with it, expect to go through a sixer on game day. Alcohol isn't a concern till it hits your head. Just have some chips & you'll be fine.  Even me, the anti-hophead, can appreciate this balanced beer. :)",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,adammills,2.87,"This beer pours a crisp clean looking amber with a yellow orangish head that fades but does remain on top of the beer. Aroma is very weak. Some citrus notes, bitter smelling, no floral or fruit in the nose at all, disappointing. It is a shocking beer to the palate, all hops. Very blunt up front, citrusy, it seems as if the hop bitterness is overwhelming the hop flavor. Spicy hot from the hops, and they manage to cover the malt almost completely. Not well balanced. Could have used some more base malt in my estimation, because kicking it up to eight percent may have balanced this beer more. Worth the try, but I would not purchase this beer again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,uconnalum2,4.42,"Appearance is a hazy honey color. The head is thin and frothy but disappears in a few minutes. The smell is a wonderful combination of citrus, honey and sweet malt. It really adds to the enjoyment of the beer. The taste is at first sweet and almost honey-like. Lots of hops but well-balanced with malt. A slight buttery finish at the end. This beer is downright delicious. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, smooth and refreshing. Drinkability is outstanding... a very good session beer. Overall, this is a great beer and my favorite IPA so far.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,veech,4.22,"Just snagged a sixer on a return trip home through Asheville, NC. This was the first time I'd seen Victory in my general area so I was eager to see what all the BA hype was all about. I was not disappointed. The beer was very complex and strong without being over complicated or affecting its drinkability. The hops were prevalent and plentiful, but not without just enough maltiness for proper balance on both the nose and tongue. Mouthfeel was great with a medium body, perfect carbonation and viscosity. I found it to be a very smooth drinking IPA for one that has a little more ABV than a typical session beer. The results of which could result in not exactly looking or feeling one's best the next a.m. All in all I was glad to get to finally try a Victory brew, and I will have to return for some Prima Pils when I get a chance. Well deserved praise. Hype on BA's.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,beeragent,3.97,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a deep amber, forming a 1/4 inch head, that slowly faded, leaving medium lacing on the glass. The aroma is all hops. The taste is oh so good! Hops and more hops. Nice citrus flavor, but not overkill, with a good balance of malts. Thick medium mouthfeel, but very smooth. This is a great pale ale, and a very good session ale. I think I've found a new favorite.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,wagenvolks,4.23,"Color transitions from a golden orange on the outside to a hazy brownish red. Head is a bit lacking, with little to no lacing. Good bubbling and head retention. Aroma isn't a strong as I would like, but consists of sweet hops well balanced by a honey malt. Notes of jerk spice, pear, and caramel, too.  Taste is obviously quite hoppy, with some serious spice. Soft, sweet notes of citrus and caramel present. The moutfeel is top notch...big hoppy bite across the whole tongue with a buttery smooth finish. Light, non-overwhelming aftertaste which I like, combined with a perfect amount of carbonation. This beer is refreshing as hell, quite complex so no palate fatigue (why not just say ""you won't get bored with this one""? fucking beer snobs...) Definately give this a try.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Rennpferd,4.01,Poured from a 12oz bottle into a clean pint glass.  It poured a clear amber color with very little head. There was low activity in the beer and it left a slightly sticky lacing to the sides of the glass.  It had a very hoppy smell with a hint of malt.  An almost balanced very hoppy and malty taste. It left a sweet aftertaste. It was smooth and light.  This beer is very drinkable and almost goes down to easy.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,quasimoto,4.1,"A - Pours a deep crytal clear amber color. The head was about a finger thick, (soft pour) but still it leaves laces around the glass.  S - Grapefruit, and peaches are melded together with piney almost yeasty aromas. Very clean.  T - The aromas transfer to the flavors and are even better the slicht peachy flavor of the hops is really apparent. The toasty flavor of malts comes to the middle of the beer, and finishes very clean.  M - Light dry and crisp. The bitterenss strikes the tongue right off the bat. It finishes clean, and leaves a nice piney aftertaste.  D - This is what IPAs should taste like..only a little bit stronger on the aromas.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,guinnessfan,4,"12 oz bottle from variety pack purchased at Breski's  A: Ruby copper ale, with a one finger head that quickly fled the scene, leaving a small trail of lacing behind.  S: Hops, citrus, etc. as expected.  T: Good hop bitterness, balanced well with malt. Grapefruity taste lingers.  M: Mild carbonation, medium body, seems to have a somewhat oily texture.  D: Good beer, easy to drink due to the balance of malt. Not as good as HopBack Amber, but good nonetheless.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,gmcfarre,4.2,"12 oz bottle poured into Bowtie glass Bottle has ""Enjoy by"" date of Jan 23, 2007. Just in time!  A - Beer pours a clear ruby orange color with a nominal 1 inch off-white head. Lacing is present but not outstanding.  S - Floral hops with slight grapefruit notes and a noticeable sweet malt balancing act. A nice blend, but not overly aromatic.  T - Clean, bitter hop taste with a nice tangy grapefruit addition. Very smooth for an IPA, with a moderately drying finish. As it warms the bite increases, but this is still very enjoyable.  M - Moderate carbonation up front, then smooths out with a medium body. Finishes with the requisite drying bitterness.  D - A well rounded and tasty IPA that is certainly worth enjoying. Quaffable and interesting enough where I will probably be buying more in the future.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,SkinnyElvis,4.12,This is the brew that converted me to craft beer about 7 or 8 years ago. Typical IPA color with a strong floral nose. Hops are the dominant flavor but they are not overwhelming due to a good malt base. Easy to drink with a reasonable ABV. My tastes have changed over the years (I prefer even hoppier beer) but this is a standby for me at home and out in the Phila area where it is often available on tap. I do prefer the Devil on draft than in a bottle.  Cheers.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,EPICAC,3.96,"I purchased a six-pack of this last night at Libby's Liquors in Central Square. I had two bottles with dinner last night at a friend's apartment.  Appearance: Pours a beautiful, hazy reddish-copper with a thick, beige head that fades to a film leaving heavy but patchy lace on the inside of the glass. I really love the color.  Smell: Sweet malts with some tart fruitiness, a whiff of alcohol and some grassy, resiny and grapefruit hop aromas.  Taste: Toasty malts upfront that move into a fruity and sugary sweetness. The finish is a grassy and resiny hop bitterness with a lingering tartness.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and oily with low carbonation.  Drinkability: This is really hop-forward making it a bit hard to drink.  Overall: This is an excellent American IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,bgraney,4.23,"Dark honey color with reddish hues. Foamy white head which slowly dissolves and leaves an intricate lacing. Impressive look. The devil is in the aroma. All citrusy/grapefruit/lemon juicy hops. Even though the hops dominate the flavor there is a very well balanced malt background. Smooth mouthfeel with the hop bitterness. Grapefruit lingers on the tongue. Drinkablity is similar to most IPA's, as long as you don't get tired of the hops they'll keep going down smooth. An outstanding IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,pootz,3.85,"Bottle:  Poured a shimmering opaque light copper-amber ale into the glass. Decent 2 finger rocky cap lasts well and laces.  Aroma is a massive gob-smack of Cascade and Warrior hops with a big floral-grapefruit bouquet, some earthy sweetness from the malts.  Impression: Substantial malt backbone, soapy mouth feel, medium-light body... citrusy hop-rich smooth character.  Profile: Up front rich amber malts attack for just a second then a rush of NW hops produce a acerbic marmalade on toast effect....mid palate the hops get stronger as the bready toasty malts drop back,,,,as you approach the finish it turns slightly dry as the hops still hang in creating a bittering finish and lingering metallic aftertaste.  This is a rock solid crafted APA with all the Pacific NW hop flair out pacing the big malts...not as full bodied and balanced as Libery ale but good standard sipping fare for hop heads",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,racer2k,3.78,"Appearance- A dark copper color with a fine haze to boot. My pint glass seems to be creating a nice consistent lace around the glass. Some moderate carbonation  Smell- I can smell hints of earthiness with a balance of citrus and fruit under my nose. Nice smell  Taste- The initial taste is one of an earthy ale but a distinct burst of hops finishes as you swallow. Well balanced, good hop characteristic, and a smooth finish. There is a hint of malt as you initially take the sip but it transitions nicely to hops.  Mouthfeel- A mix of malty and hops with a slight hint of the alcohol in the beer. Low to moderate carbonation would be the rule of thumb.  Drinkability- This beer sets up as a good session beer though the 6.7% ABV is hard to find so it may be a short session.  Overall - A nice beer if you like a stronger IPA with good hop and malt characteristics.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Mattysox,4.05,"For my first review, I've selected a beer that has become one of my standard issue, go to brews...I've been pretty impressed with Victory in general, and this beer in particular, during my numerous tastings of it.   HopDevil pours a ruddy, pale orange color, usually with a fairly solid, substantial head, if you pour it aggressively. First notes to your nose are a little grapefruit and piney hops, but definitely more citrus than x-mas. It has a smooth mouthfeel, with enough carbonation to be bracing but not obnoxious. The hops, of course, are the centerpiece of the beer, but there is great malty balance to it, and that, I think, is this beer's true strength. It is very well balanced and eminently drinkable, despite its modestly high ABV. It finishes more bitter than it tastes initially, but that's not a bad thing, as the hop profile of this is pretty tasty.   One final note, if you can find this on tap, as I do at Tallula in Arlington, VA, you'll find a slightly smoother, less carbonated mouthfeel. Definitely worth seeking out.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,jscottku21,4.43,"I can't say enough about the HopDevil. Fantastic IPA that provides quite a kick both with it's hoppy flavor and ABV. I would recommend this beer to anyone who is a fan of the IPA style. This is my new default beer, as it is both economical and extremely tasty. Cheers!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Mebuzzard,4.25,"Beautiful copper body with tints of red and orange. Topped with a fluffy white head that left chunks of foam in the middle of the brew. Pine and orange peel dominate the aroma with some floral and grass touches. Taste starts with some sweet malt, very quickly, then the hops kick in. Citrus, grass and young pine are present here. Bite starts off hard, but dwindles down. The alcohol becomes present, yet sublte. Clean finish. Crisp. Drinkability overshadows the taste, it'll hook ya.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,jbramley,4.65,Pours a nice amber from the bottle. A very hoppy nose attacked my nostrils. The first few drinks were almost rough until my mouth adjusted to the hoppyness of the beer. A fine citrus with an evergreen undertone. Very drinkable with slight grapefruit after taste.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,MVassar,4.54,"Rich, amber color, and a thick, creamy, long-lasting head, with an enticing cream color, touched with honey. Lacing just sticks around forever.  Some malt, caramel, and citrus hops in the somewhat reticent nose.  Wow. Gobs of flavor here. Loads of bitter hops that initially threaten to overtake everything, but are beautifully subdued by lush malt, bread, and honey flavors. Extraordinary.  Huge body, with sweet, creamy textures.  My only caveat would be the intense amount of hops for the uninitiated. As for me, I could drink this amazing stuff all day long.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,shadow1961,3.75,"Hop Devil pours out a thick foamy head that collapses pretty quickly. The brew is a cloudy amber color with good carbonation. Nose is malty and herbal. Flavor is of hops with a bit of malt making it's way out. It's hard to pin down but there's something summery feeling about the flavor. Aftertaste is of bitter hop. Alcohol by volume 6.7%. If you're someone who likes your hops aggressive, this is the brew for you- although for balance you can't beat Bell's Two-hearted, and for the mellow herbal side of the hop equation you might like Full Sail Pale Ale instead. Still, a worthy brew in it's own right.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,BeerSox,4.12,"12oz bottle into mug.  Deep amber hue with a touch of red tint. A little darker than most IPAs, even American IPAs. In inch head that slowly settles a a thin cap. Sticky lacing that's nicely layered.  Strong piney hops explode from the beer giving the aroma of grapefruit. Light sweet malts in the background. Sweet honey scents creep through the overpowering hops.  Grainy malts and citrusy hops are the dominant flavors, and don't allow for much else. Medium bodied with medium carbonation, mixed with the alpha acids, give a crisp bite to the tongue. The finish, of course, is loaded with lingering hop bitterness.  A good American IPA, loaded with crisp hops. Very delicious. Recommended.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,GregBrewski,3.78,"Pours a dark orange or amber color with a light head that diminished quickly. In the aroma, hops mostly prevail with a mix malt sweetness. Not an overpowering aroma, like I expected. Same thing goes for the taste. I was expecting a ridiculously hopy brew, thats not what it delivers. It is a good balanced mix of malt and hops. The spice is first noticed that it trails off and finishes somewhat smooth with a bitter aftertaste. This is a good IPA, with well balanced and bold tones. I was expecting more though, probably b/c of the name...however, still worth a try.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,alephilmac,4.01,"Poured in an Imperial pint. Very attractive, dark (for an IPA), redish hue, decent off-white head that faded partway through. The nose lacked a great deal of character, a little floral, but not too much. The taste was quite nice, initial sweetness that faded into a mild bitter finish. Overall drinkability was fairly high, the beer needed to warm just a tad before it really got going.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,flexabull,3.98,"Pours a bright clear reddish amber color with a slight head.  Aromas are a touch hoppy, bitter, and floral, but I mostly notice a sweet maltiness on the nose. Smells are decent, but not what I expected from an IPA.  Flavor is crisp, sweet, creamy and malty. But where are the hops? (Isn't this called ""HopDevil""?) They seem to be lacking here, only notice them just slightly on the finish. It is a good tasting beer, but reminds me much more of a pale ale, not an IPA.  Mouthfeel is pretty good, the malty creaminess sticks to your mouth.  This is a very drinkable beer, very session worthy. But this to me doesn't seem to have a lot of American IPA qualities. (maybe British IPA qualities...) Still worth a try, just not at all what I expected.  Thanks for the bottle Mikesgroove!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,gunnerman,4,"Poured into a pint glass, pours a orange color with a white head that leaves some lace on the glass. Smell is of hoppy malty goodness it has that nice citrus hop smell that we love.

Awesome offering from victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,mikesgroove,4.08,"Pours a rich copper with a nice creamy colored head and significant lace. Looks great. Smell is richly hopped , with even a bit of a sugary presence. Taste was very nice, not overly upfront with the hops, but it will catch you on the back end. Nice dry finish. Again that almost caramel malty taste rounds this out very nicely. Very smooth as well. This is a good IPA that is not Crazy Hopped, although I do prefer insanely hopped beers. Overall very nice.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,gmfessen,4.38,"Poured out of a very cool looking bottle into a pint glass, this beer is amber-brown in color with a decent one finger bubbly head. Head dies down quickly and leaves small bits of lacing on the glass. The smell is of spicy hops. The taste follows suit, with a sweet grapefruity malt start and spicy hop finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied, creamy. Overall I would have to say this is a very drinkable beer, the 6.7 abv is very well hidden, a must try for hopheads everywhere.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,AltBock,3.89,"12 oz. bottle with a bright blue/purple label with a big green hop that had two beady eyes, elf ears, two devil horns, and with an evil grin on his face. What more can I say, it's looks like Hop Devil, if it were real. Above the Hop Devil is the title of the beer that looks like it's on fire. To the left of the picture is information about the Hop Devil lore, the beer itself, and the Brewmaster's signature. In the middle between the picture and the information is a best before date that is easily seen. No funky number or batch number, just a simple best before date. My bottle is best before Feb 13, 2007. To the left of the Hop Devil is just the barcode and Government warning. Victory always has nice labels and this one doesn't disappoint.  Appearance: When poured into a simple Bell's Brewery American pint glass, the beer is pretty much an average honey amber color. Nothing really spectacular about the color here. When poured, it had a nice 1 finger fluffy head of white foam to it, but that soon departed into an extremely low amount of white rings and really no lace around the glass. That was disappointing. If the beer's appearance was as good as the label, then this beer would have received a 5 in appearance.  Smell: When I poured it, I was no further than just a couple inches away from the glass when I got a whiff of strong bitter floral hops coming from the glass. When it finally got settled, it wasn't as strong as it was when I first opened it. What was there now was a big floral hop presence, a huge helping of citrus fruits, hint of caramel, and a touch of sweet malts at the end.  Taste: I wouldn't say it's a devil of a hoppy beer because there are much more hoppy beers out there than this one. Don't get me wrong, this beer is hoppy, but it's sure doesn't have a devil strength amount of hops to it. What it has instead was a not too overpowering taste of dry bitter citrus hops, some caramel here and there, a slight biscuit flavor, and with the slightest taste of sweet malts at the end. If you like the taste of citrus flavored hops, then you'll like the taste of this one.  Mouthfeel: I would have to say that it's medium bodied, very little carbonation, aftertaste of those bitter citrus hops, and I thought that this beer was a bit too dry for my taste at the end.  Drinkability: Not really a Devil of a beer, but it's still quite drinkable if you're ever in an IPA mood. I could drink it again in the future. I don't have a problem with that idea. I would have to say that is a must try after you had their great Storm King Stout.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Primarily a lemon aroma with hints of orange and grapefruit. There is also a very crisp light green apple. Nice blend.  Taste of hops is quite strong. A nice light lemony citrus blend is present in the back of the throat. Very faint hint of malt can be detected when held on the tongue. Great flavor.  A nice thick beer feel. A decent movement of carbonation on the surfaces helps the flavors move.  Great beer. Very nice beer with a plate of cheese.

Taste was upfront moderate bitter pine and nuttiness and dark bread sweetness followed by a doughy and dry nutty bitterness with the hops pine kicking back in to die on a sweet perfumey long finish. Hints of maple syrup towards the end too. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, soft and creamy, lively carbonated, and moderately astringent.

I stopped by Barcade in Brooklyn where they had it casked. A deep ruby, colored somewhere in between a Brown ale and a Red. The aroma was very hop-rich, with subtle hints of sweetness. By smell alone you could definitely tell that it had been casked. Upon the first sip the hop pronunciation and earthy cask flavor were very bold, yet well balanced on the tongue. A loosely carbonated and moderately malty mouthfeel kept the hop flavors rolling across the tongue until the slight fruity and sweet finish.

345,1005,rabsten,4.65,"On cask at D's Six Packs and Dogz. Clear orange amber with fluffy head and sticky lacing.  Floral hops and more hops. Very sweet and soothing. Some tea-like notes (earl grey, so probably bergamot) as well.  Very balanced pale ale. Malt, which was not present in the smell at all was surprisingly stong and supported the hops nicely. Pretty much all I'm looking for in an IPA most of the time.  Slightly watery mouthfeel but very easy to drink. If I hadn't had to drive to Morgantown, I may have had half a dozen of these.  I have a six of the bottles and the cask is - quite simply - a completely different beer. Very balanced and mellow, while the bottle is a pure hop bomb (and one I like a lot). Definately worth picking up while it's available.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Atlas1,4.05,"I'm a fan of the Victory beers, and this is no exception. Pours a dense apricot orange color. The aroma is hoppy and sweet, but not overpowering. A crisp, hoppy taste with a sturdy mouthfeel. A bit syrupy, but not so much as to detract from the overall enjoyment of this beer. Finishes well with a pleasantly lingering note of hop character at the roof of the mouth. And I even kinda like the bottle label. Nice ""hop devil.""",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,CharlieMopps,4.1,"A: Half-inch head with a little retention and a decent amount of lacing. Cloudy red amber/rust color.  S: Malty background with nice hop scents and a fruity or bready overtone.  T: Hop-heavy throughout, with beginning malt notes and a nice salty and spicy dry finish. Detected a bit of fruit, sharp taste. Amazing.  M: Good carbonation and an oily hop feel with a light finish after the pleasant shock to the tastebuds.  D: Pour me another! The initial shock could begin to wear the palate thin, especially after a few. Still, a great beer to liven you up from a smack in the mouth with hops.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Finishes dry fruitty & hoppy  MF: Rich & slightlty effervescent & great balance  Drinks really easy, a nice IPA that is now availible in CO, yeah!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Osiris9588,4.42,"Pours a rusty copper color from a 12oz bottle, no freshness date. The off-white head is pretty weak, dissipating quickly.  The toasty aroma consists of malt, caramel, toffee, and dry hops. The flavor is obviously dominated by hops, but the complexity is so great that they are not overbearing--you find butterscotch, caramel, toffee, toasted malts, and all types of warm goodness.  The mouth is full and complex, begins a little lighter, then finishes with wallop of roasted and bitter hoppiness, yet it never grows unpleasant. I'm a hop fiend, but I still do not see drinking more than maybe two of these in a sitting. But who cares, it's an amazing beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,EvilKeith,3.97,"HopDevil poured into the glass a lightly hazed dark copper color. The head was a beige froth that would not look out of place on a latte. The lacing was thick and clung to the glass. The smell was dominated by big biscuity malts, sweet caramel, and pungent spicy hops. The taste had a slight sweetness, grapefruit citrus, spicy, a distinct nuttiness with ample hop bittering and a delightful dry finish. A slick and oily mouthfeel sits on a medium body with moderate carbonation. Not as hopped as the name had led me to believe, but not a bad American IPA. Certaintly drinkable compared to some west coast versions of the style. I will happily drink the rest of the sixer and keep an eye out for this one in the future.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,joe1510,3.98,12oz. Bottle  Hopdevil poured a beautiful clear amber. A 1+finger creamy off-white eggshell head formed and stuck around awhile. Moderate lacing sticks throughout the drink.  Smell is of sweet malts. Along with citrusy hops. Sweetened grapefruit and a touch of pine. The front has a nice caramel nose followed by the citrus. Very nice.  This beer is very well balanced. The taste starts off with a quick bite followed by grapefruit and ends with a good grapefruit pulp bitterness. This is all held in check by a good malt backbone that balences everything nicely. A touch of pine in the taste too. As it warms there's a slight alcohol presence in the nose and throat.  Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied. Light bodied on the finish. A little on the watery side. Feels more medium bodied when first taken in. Light on the carbonation.  Drnkability is pretty high. With the lighter body and the nice balance between the hops and malt I could very easily enjoy a few of these at a time.  Overall this is a very well made beer from Victory. I was a little surprised though as I was looking for a more one sided hoppy ipa. Pick it up if you see it.  Slainte!,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,jwc215,4.35,"Best by Jan.31, 2007- drank early October, 2006  Pours copper with a thin, white lasting head. Some lacing is left.  The smell is of fresh citrusy hops - grapefruit and orange peel.  There is a crisp, bitter citrus flavor upfront. Spiced fruits. A grainy malt backbone is just enough to give the hops support and body, and to add to the delicious complexity of the drink. A slight breadiness also adds to its character and depth. An alcoholic punch is noticeable, but doesn't interfere in the flavors. The hops are on the powerful side, but are not out-of-control, mainly because of the lingering sweet malt that makes it as balanced as it should be for the style.  The feel is creamy and rich. The full body and flavors hang on tightly. It goes down smoothly.  This is a shining example of an American IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,mrasskicktastic,3.81,"A - Three fingers of frothy white head rest atop a copper brew with a ruby tint. The lacing is not a mere glob of foam stuck to the sides of the glass, it is actually lacing into intricate and elegant patterns. A sight to behold.  S - A potent pine on the nose with a bit of floral notes. A bit of pepper, but it think it is actually cleverly disguised alcohol. Though simple, it is quite good.  T - A powerful pine hop with a rose backing and a bit of light malt. The aftertaste is a medium grassy and pine bitterness. A good IPA taste.  M - Pretty thick. Carbonation is too high, it makes my mouth numb. Something also makes it a little slimy. Still slightly refreshing . . . somehow.  D - Here the mouthfeel does the most damage. I had it before and I'll have it again. It is about as close as you can come to a beer staple in my opinion. I am not a huge victory fan, but this is definitely a good beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,TheManiacalOne,4.52,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a US tumbler pint glass.  A: The beer is a bright reddish amber color with a short foamy white head that fades at a decent rate and leaves a thick, even lace on the glass.  S: The aroma is of well-blended hops and citrus.  T: Big hops flavor comes out first and is quickly followed by some malty citrus sweetness, but the hops flavor, while balanced well, is certainly the dominant flavor.  M: Very crisp and smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, clean finish.  D: Very tasty, not filling as it seemed a little light for the style, a good kick, this one is very poundable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,InsolublePancake,3.32,"A- Deep orange-red with surprisingly little head or lacing. Looks kind of hazy.  S- Very sweet-smelling with caramel malt and citrusy hops.  T- Malt presence is quite strong here. Toasted, caramelly flavors abound. Hops are certainly there with an orangey flavor, but are not as prominent as I was expecting. Alcohol pops up every once in a while too. Fairly high bitterness on the finish.  M- Nice medium-bodied mouthfeel. Carbonation is pretty strong here.  D- Good drinkability, not great, but good. I could put down a couple of these, but not more than that.  Eh, I wasn't that impressed with this one. I was expecting more. The hops weren't as prominent as I had hoped. The balance between malt and hops was good no doubt, but the hop flavor was rather nondescript. It's alright, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it. I had it on tap once and it was much better.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,eballard,3.5,This beer pours a hazy brown amber color with a light head that settles into a nice lacing. It has a sweet malted hops smell with a slight sent of spice. The flavor is what really hits you about this beer. Its a strong spice with a heavy bite. The aftertaste is a little bitter but over all its got a good taste. This is one bold beer. The beer goes down smooth with a slight aftertaste. In all this is an interesting beer and worth a try.

345,1005,BlackJeremiah,4.06,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into an English pint glass.  A: Deep reddish amber, with lazy but consistent streamers. Head is 1.5"" thick, luxurious and creamy-looking. After a minute, reduces to about 1/2"" head, with a full circumference of lace. Really delicious looking.  S: Pine was the only thing I could smell at first. After a quick swirl, citrus and a slight caramel scent reveal themselves. Doesn't smell balanced, but as a hop-head, I personally like it.  T: Crisp grapefruit bite followed by a cream-soda-like malt rush, fading away under the siege of a pine forest of hop bitterness. Although the bitterness overwhelms the malt through the early aftertaste, puckering my palate, the last flavor I can taste is the ghost of a sweet *something*. A really schizoid beer; I love it, but I can't call it well-balanced. Fits the name, though: the HopDevil really comes out to play, then runs away.  M: Oddly thick at first; it's almost like it dissolves in your mouth, becoming thinner as it passes across your taste buds. Kind of cool, really.  D: It seems stronger than 6.7% ABV, but the intriguing ""ninja attack"" nature of the hops makes it neither overwhelming nor boring. I could definitely drink several of these in a sitting. In fact, I think I will.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Aroma comes out more as it warms up, strong hoppy scent, but not overwhelming.  Smooth balance of malt and hops, but hops definitely dominant. Strong hoppy aftertaste -- if you like that sorta thing. The hops mellowed out a bit as it warmed up.  Slightly fizzy feel, but not in a negative way. I can usually drink about two of these in a row before I have to move to an ale or witbier to cleanse the palate, just because the hops are so prevalent.

345,1005,czechsaaz,3.11,"Nice grassy hop nose with hints of citrys. But the hops overpower any other aromatics. I get no malt or yeast character through it. It's a pleasant smell, but I want more complexity.  Nice amber color with incredible clarity. A little rising carbonation with a big frothy head that fades quickly to a thin solid layer.  Flavor is powerfully hop bitter. Then comes a grassy hop flavor and then more hop aftertaste. It isn't until the long ligering effects of aftertaste that I can pick up some malt profile. Basically, this is a throw handfuls of hops in a batch beer. Which makes it not to my liking. There's more to beer than straight alpha acid.  Decent body with a nice carbonation level. So bitter though that it feels dry and a little astringent.  I'm not really impressed. For me this falls into the category of beers that have no finesse, only hops.

This brew isn't quite as over the top as many IPAs but you can get your fix and still enjoy the beer very much. Nice bitterness too.  Drinkability: Session brew for me and my father, the only craft brew drinkers in what feels like hundreds of miles.

345,1005,Pegasus,3.7,"Appearance: Rather hazy amber in color, with superb retention of the massive off-white head and superb lacing. The carbonation is fairly profuse, with numerous small, slow-rising bubbles.  Aroma: Massive herbal hop aroma, with spicy highlights, annd less of the prototypical pine tar and grapefruit notes. Beneath the hop onslaught there is a solid sweet caramel malt backbone.  Taste: Opens with a moment of caramel malt, which is quickly ambushed by a flagrant pine tar hop presence. The malt presence is sturdy enough to withstand the hop assault, but it is relegated to a supporting role. The finish is dominated by a lingering medicinal hop note. The relatively high alcoholic content is artfully concealed.  Mouth feel: Smooth, soft, and quite full.  Drinkability/notes: Excessive bittering hops mar an otherwise well-crafted American IPA.

Very solid, and equally delicious. The American hops kick in halfway providing a solid amount of bitterness into the mix. Hoppiness is perfect for an IPA this size.

A bit of lacing sticks to the glass, and stays put.  The nose is full of grassy, musty, floral, and citrus (particularly grapefruit) notes. I dig the outdoorsy smell going on here....like after it rains in the spring. It smells...zesty and fresh.  Oh yeah! That's goood! Grassy vegetal sweetness (like flowers maybe?) predominates along with a fresh mouthfeel. Then, the sweetness turns to bitter grapefruit mid-sip followed by a bitter alcohol punch. I can taste quite a bit of malt for an IPA....and for me that is a good thing. IMO this is a very balanced beer (for the style at least).  I really like the nature-y fresh zest and the sweet and sour combo on the tongue. For me, this is very very drinkable since it has that hop heavy kcik that I crave, but the sour pucker is not at all overwhelming even towards the end of the glass!

I've just gotten a Victory variety case, and review of Prima Pils, HopDevil, Lager, and GM are coming right along, some not for the first time.  HopDevil is a beauty of a beer, with a very creamy, very light tan head that has some huge bubbles. It falls pretty quickly, which hurts it a bit, but the sticky lacing helps to make up for it. The beer is a bright golden amber. Smell is strong of sweet caramel and a lovely hop combination. The hops are initially biting and bitter on the tongue, and then the beer gets smooth in a very nice way that is so much fun to repeat. The hops really build in the back of your throat, perhaps slowing consumption a bit.

Left a nice lacing on glass. Brilliant clarity.  S: Piney intense floral aroma with a little fruity citrus thrown in there to boot.  T: Ardent hoppy flavor. Piney, cloyingly hoppy bitter taste up front and carried through to the end. A slight malt base is hiding out behind all those hops but comes nowhere near balancing out the aggressive hoppy taste of this beer and that is fine with me.  M: Moderate body slightly resiny. Hoppy astringency makes this a thirst quenching brew.  D: Probably one of the best examples of an American IPA out there.

Pours a beautiful dark amber, with slight head that laced well. Light carbonation. Medium aroma of hops. Full, somewhat warming, bitter hoppy taste - but not overly complex, and not as fruity as I prefer in this type of beer. This beer was enjoyed after a 20 minute walk home from the store on a warm night, so perhaps it should have been consumed a few degrees cooler - although I'm generally a fan of cellar-temperature beers.

345,1005,tboom29,4.18,"I poured this into my pint glass, and it was a burgundy brown color. Real big, full head, which lasted a long time. I didn't think this had a huge nose, but it was slightly hoppy and malty.  The first thing you notice when you taste it though, really the only thing, is HOPS. This is an aggressively hopped beer. Loads of big, bitter hops up front. There is a bit of malt in the background, which slightly mellows the hops, but only slightly. The slighly biscuity flavor comes through after the malt. The maltiness comes through as it warms, as I highly recommend letting it sit for a few. I took my first few sips when it was still too cold, and there was not much balance. Through out there is a hop essence, zesty almost, that coats the mouth that hop heads will love.  I think if you are going to pair this with food, make sure it is something that can stand up to the flavors. I was eating some thai food that almost held up, but not quite. Overall, not for the faint of heart beer drinkers, but hop heads, will dig this beer. I did.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Smell is sweet and malty, lots of toffee, but with nice floral/pine hops, good balance. Taste is sweet toffee, some grains, lots of floral hops, little bit of pine, clean bitter finish.

Overall a nice brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,demcorhip,4.3,"Much thanks to Raider for this one.  Appearance Almost clear dark amber ale with slight coppery and brown tinge. A thin off white head formed on the pour which faded into scant lacings. Finely carbonated.  Aroma Grapefruit (citrus and pine) predominates overtop of floral, bready, and caramel scents.  Taste Sweet floral and bready flavours with caramel are almost immediately smothered in a powerful grapefruit flavour from the hops. The taste ends in an almost tea like or grapefruit peal like astringency.  Mouthfeel This is a wonderfully balanced and bold example of the american IPA style. It has a substantial malt body which is wonderfully offset by the powerful yet not too bitter hoppiness. The carbonation aids in delivering this wonderful flavour contrast and combination.  Drinkability This is a very drinkable ale, and due to its balance and bold flavour the alcohol content sneaks by unnoticed. This is not a beer for those faint of hops and probably isnt a great IPA to introduce a hop novice to. If you like hops, however, this is a great beer, and it goes down very easy. Ill be drinking this one again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,AaronHomoya,4,"12 oz brown bottle. A couple of weeks past the best by date - too bad.  Appearance is an auburn color with decent head and fairly light carbonation.  Smell is a nice hoppy, citrus aroma with maybe a hint of caramel.  Taste is malt and caramel, then hop flavor, citrusy, then finishes with a fair bit of hops bitterness and a grapefruit rind aftertaste. Just balanced enough to not be an unpleasant, harsh bitterness. Still probably too much for some, though.  Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, nice feeling with the light carbonation.  Overall, a very drinkable IPA that is pretty hoppy but still balanced enough that I would drink it regularly, and often, if it was more available here. I would also like to try it when fresher.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,dansm,3.68,"A-Pours a rich, clear amber with a decent off-white head.  S-Not as much going on here as I would expect. Light floral hops, with an even lighter slightly sweet maltiness.  T-Leads off with a slight sweet malt, right before the hoppy bitters kicks in. Not exactly a perfect balance, but ineresting none the less.  M-Medium bodied, dry, and light carbonation.  D-This is a fairly drinkable beer. If you enjoy a moderately hopped up brew, than this is worth a try.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,hero27,3.49,"12 oz bottle.  Deep, clear amber color. Frothy tan head. To be honest, I didn't pick up much of anything on the aroma..quite odd actually, considering the taste is very hop-driven. Light caramel malts and a touch of hops, that's it. The taste is definitely more bold, with an earthy malt presence and a thick blanket of floral hops. I'll probably take hell for this, but I think HopDevil is certainly one of the more overrated IPAs out there. I've tried it a number of times and I've yet to be blown away by it. Worth a shot, absolutely. Near the top of it's class? Not in my book..",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,beerdeity,4.17,"This beer is a nice dark amber, and has a captivating aroma. The hops are extremely present in the first smell. The first taste is quite overwhelming, given the elevated IBUs, but subsequent mouthfuls proof to be less intense. Eventually the beer provides a very pleaseant mouthfeel, and extremely satisfying taste.

Very clear with little carbonation.  S: Not as big a hop nose as I'd hoped for. There is a subtle but good smelling floral and pine hop aroma present. However, I found the smell slightly musty and hinting on metallic.  T: Decent taste, but seems an imbalance toward bitterness. Hop portion of the flavor comes off as sort of flat or chalky. The malt that is present gives a very light sweetness. Tastes weaker than I'd expected, more of an ""imp"" than a ""devil""...a Pale Ale?  M: Mouthfeel is medium. Has a good clean finish, but with more lingering bitterness. I also found this to be quite dry. Does have a creaminess and full flavors which I like.  D: Yes, a good beer. I like a more balanced IPA than this one so I would probably not make this beer my first choice. Drinkable but I've had better - this surprises me because of the fine reviews I've read here & elsewhere.

345,1005,Estarrio,4.08,"Poured a clear, bright orange-brown with a medium off-white head. Good retention.  Nice American IPA aroma consisting of pine, fruit and rather sweet malt. My one gripe about the beer would be that the smells are perhaps a little too subtle.  Lightly sweet malt taste quickly gives way to a flavor implosion. Fruit flavors (though not overly citrus) mix with a nice bouquet of hops, spruce and pine with a pleasing semi-dry bitter aftertaste. It's a very interesting mix and order of familiar flavors presented in a unique and great tasting brew.  Very well carbonated and very drinkable.  I decided that tonight was IPA night and what better way to start? This fine American IPA features a cleverly crafted devil made from hops on the bottle. I look forward to finishing the six-pack!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

This beer (at this time) is my (largely unqualified) bench mark for IPAs  A - The is a great looking beer. Dark red bronze look to it. Big head upon pour, nice lacing. Ive swirled this one a few times.  S - Smells like hops as it should  T - Hoppy, some sweetness to it. You taste the booze on almost every swig. I have a great respect for this brew. It was actually the beer that moved me to the APAs and the IPAs.  M - Full , Creamy- but not overdone  D - Clearly a session beer, Ive proved it many times. I think this is a quality beer  Last point - I had this beer at the pub the night of the 10 year anniversary. Nothing like the bottle.

Slight bready malt sense.  The taste is very bold, the hops knock you over( in a good way). Slight citrus flavors with nice spices.For how bold the hops are, is still a nice well balenced beer. Sweet malts , grasses in the finish.  This a very good beer, but you have to love the intense hops. Otherwise you might feel they are overwhelming.

I let the beer sit, and the head subsides slightly. I bring it to my nose. Not picking up too much, just some fresh hops. First eager drink. Wow. suprised to say i did'nt get to much out of this, not very hoppy in my opinion. I don't know what most people think of this, but for my money, this would be an exceptional APA, but comes nowhere near my personal expectations for an IPA. I find the mouthfeel to be very nice, and I do think the drinkability on this beer is mighty high.

Great lacing stuck to the side of the glass. The smell was the expected hops. Hopdevil is a hoppy IPA, and a well established one (I try not to read other people's reviews, but at the time of this review this beer had been reviewed over 800 times). I found the hoppiness to lean towards the piney/spicey side with some, but just a little citrus tones. The texture developed an excellent creaminess as the beer warmed. The mouthfeel is medium and the 6.7% is hidden and a way drinkable beer. This is a solid IPA one to have when its available.  Notes: We brought these out to Planet of the Ales, and I enjoyed the ones I drank while camping there. It's a very solid American IPA, but as the style has grown in popularity, better renditions have been developed.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Appearance: ruddy amber color, good head, not much lacing but possibly because I was forced to reuse the glass (waitress didn't bring me a new one, and she was hard enough to track down to order)  Smell: lots and lots of hops, with a grapefruity character  Taste: again, grapefruit hops (though not as grapefruity as smuttynose), very dry, with a touch of caramel.  Mouthfeel: much lighter mouthfeel than I expected, I would have preferred a little more.  Drinkability: good, but on the whole (and it's great to be able to say this!)

S: A Floral hops aroma was apparent in this beer. However, I was able to smell some fruity maltiness to it which was akin to the smell of green apples.  T: Very similar to the aroma. It had a nice floral hops flavor that opened to an almost citrus taste. However, behind it was a nice malt backbone that tasted like apples.  M: Light to medium body. Nice and refreshing for a hot summer day like we where having in Cincinnati last week.  D: While not my favorite IPA I've had it's not bad by any bet.

The aroma was dissapointing.I was expecting a strong hop scent. Instead this beer has a very light, barely noticeable hop aroma. More floral than citrus. Also a very, very light malt scent.  The taste was pretty much just hops. It was a bitter taste - which I usually enjoy. But this one was fairly uninteresting. Like one strong bitter flavor - not a mix of flavors.  The mouthfeel was light-to-medium with a bitter, dry finish. The drinkability was good. The first glass was enjoyable.

The brew has a very green resin/floral scent AND a good malty, perhaps even roasted odor. This decoction actually has a lot more malt and a bit less hops than one might suspect. Placating your taste buds with strong roasted malts, with hints of caramel, approaching treacle, there is also quite a bit of resinous hops to fulfill the need of those who like, well, hoppy beers. This beer is only for those who truly appreciate the joys of strong hops, but it is a well balanced version of high hop holies. Not intended for all dining occasions...I would recommend it specifically with red meat.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Taste = Oh yeah, that is good! Some nice hop flavors in the same league as Stone. Bitter herbs and vegetable tastes with just enough light, sweet citrus. Felt slightly creamy with some bite and carbonation in the mouth. Drinkability: sure! The victory brewers knew just what they were doing when they came up with this one.

This is another well regarded sample from Victory  Nice sticky lacing once the tannish head evaporates. Dark copper color and outstandingly hoppy, fresh nose. The hops are brisk and delicious but not bitter as in some examples of the style.  Balanced and mature ale with top notch ingredients and quality craftsmanship.

Fermented strawberries, grapefruit and redwood make up the bouquet.  T: Begins with a lightly toasted maltiness. Light red fruit sweetness pops up in the center of the tongue. The citrus notes then show them selves then gently fade away, leaving an earthy bitterness in its wake.  M: Thinner than I expected with a little bit of a spritzy carbonation. I'd said the weakest link with this beer.  D: Good IPA. Not as complex as others on the market but certainly drinkable.

345,1005,ByTor2112,3.6,Pours a nice amber/dark orange color. Looks like a shade of pine resin that has hardened. Full blown hops aroma. Like sniffing a bag of Columbus or Amarillo hop pellets. A faint hint of Grapefruit is the only citrus note. Hops hit the palate and linger like a bad habit. The finish is more intense than the initial bitterness. A good froth while almost chewing and rolling this ale elicits a few malt flavors. I had this for the first time over three years ago but forgot how the hops literally bite back on the finifsh.

The beer gives up the hop aroma in spades. Very juicy and citrusy smell, with an encouraging whiff of sweet malt.  The taste courses with that juicy hops, flashes malt and turns to powerful bitter aspirin and resin. It was a speedy ride that I didn't like at first, but the bitterness clears out quickly and pleasantly.  Feels thickish, without the carbonation to even out the mouthfeel, but the finish is so surprisingly clean that it's not much of an issue.

Great glass clinging lacing throughout. The sticky head sticks around as a thin layer throughout. S: Aromatic scents of citrus pulp, especially grapefruit, herbal spicy scents and a good roasted grain and sweet bread smell. T: Complexity is an understatement. At first you receive a big hop punch in the face with definate spicy herbal, earthy, and citrus pulp flavors that sort of burn your tongue with delicous bitterness. Their seems to be a spiciness throughout even as the malts become apparent towards the middle and end of the sip. Some sweet malts, bread and grain are present and provide a good dose of malt to offset, although not take over, the hop spice and pulp flavors that run throughout. Finishes with another oily hop bite. MF: Medium and chewy. Overall: A complex brew that has a large dose of herbal spicy, citrus pulp hops and an equally big dose of malts. The hops are the real winner here and the malts serve to not allow the hop spiciness to burn a hole in your tongue.

Victory Hop Devil was my choice.  It pours a wonderful, clear honey colour with a foamy tan head that sticks around for quite a while, and sticks to the side of the glass. If the head was a bit thicker, I'd give it a 5. But it's hard to fault the looks.  Smell is fantastic, citrusy, spicy, with some toasty malt in the background  Taste is exactly what I want out of a big, American Hop Bomb. It's a 5, and I don't give those out willy-nilly. First impression is actually a sweet malt, until the beer hits the back of your tongue when the bittering hops get you. Nice. Then you breathe in and get the affect of the aroma hops. What a nice combination. Alcohol is hidden well behind the malt.  Mouthfeel is on the heavy side, but it fits. It's creamy, and I would say it has the same mouthfeel as a nice English Ale.

The initial taste is similar to a micro-brewed lager, but the hops add a nice kiss to the end. After the first sip the hops are easier to discern, but again do not become overpowering.

Smell: A pleasant mixture of citrus and dewy grass.  Taste and Mouthfeel: I was expecting a big hop hit from this beer, but didn't get it. Instead, the hop flavor was a constant, yet understated presence, acting almost as a foundation for the various flavors up front, which went from bitter, to sweet, to lemony, to alcoholic, which left a pretty strong aftertaste. Really flowed well. Mouthfeel was surprisingly smooth, with medium carbonation.

345,1005,tonistruth,3.86,"A- dark straw to copper in color with a big beige head, probably about 2"". Retent is very good, settles to a tiny head that never does settle. Lacing on glass.  S- all hops here. Crisp grassy aroma with some citrus in the background. Scent does take some concentration to pick up though.  T- hop bitterness is strong. Faint fruit flavor is the background, only slightly sweet. Hop flavor was both earthy and spicy. Leaves a bitter aftertaste with just a hint of citrus sweetness...just a hint.  M- light body. Overall pretty smooth. Carbonation is obvious, to an almost annoying point. Leaves palate very dry.  D- Very Good IPA, hopheads enjoy. Nice flavoring, not hard to drink. Not recommended for persons who haven't spent much time getting a taste for hops, this will scare them away.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,instrumentality,3.65,"This one poured a completely transparent amber with a 2 finger head that settled to a thin layer dimpled with random large bubbles.  The odor wasn't anything too significant, mainly just piney hops and not terribly potent.  Taste was typically piney/hoppy, malty, slightly citrusy, with a surprising undertone of what tasted like banana cream.  Mouthfeel was relatively mellow - I could taste the alcohol but it wasn't overpowering, and the carbonation was moderate. The aftertaste was mild enough - it left behind an unintrusive bitter coating on my tongue and the roof of my mouth, unlike some overhopped IPA's that completely ruin my palate.  This is a decent IPA, but given that American IPA's are probably my favorite style, I'm a bit picky, and I wouldn't consider this to be a contender for my favorite. Still, it's one of the better brews I've found available in 6-packs, and I will look forward to downing the remaining brews.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Abita45,4.38,"I think this beer lives up to the hype. Poured from a tap, it arrived with little to no head, but produced nice lacing on the glass. It was not as fragrant as I anticipated, but a clean hop flavor was present. It was not overpowering, just a strong crisp taste. The beer was dark amber in color and looked great. It has a clean, smooth mouthfeel to it, and while the hops are strong, they don't overpower or dry out your palette.  I've been waiting to really sample this beer for a while. In the past, I've either felt like drinking something else, or already had a couple of beers and thought I wouldn't be able to appreciate. I'm glad I took my time, because this beer is very good. I look forward to more of them.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,mooner,3.62,"I've heard great things but only have been able to try a lackluster old bottle, until last weekend at the Wild Horse Cafe in Beverly I had a draft. Nice APA. Hops nose was not as pronounced as the hop flavor which was strong and complex/deep. Slight ashen flavor from the yeast, and the malt was typical for the style. A nice entry in the category and surely drinkable, but not quite blown away as some folks seem to be. Could be fermented cleaner as it had a slight funk to it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Liquids,3.38,"Transparent, gorgeous amber, one finger head with large bubbles that holds and dissipates after an initially tight and creamy pour. Scant carbonation. Aroma is pure hop resins, and nothing more. Taste is pure hoppiness after the malt makes a minimal showing. Definitely a coppery amber/pale ale backdrop that is good, but this is not my favorite hop profile. Resinous and slightly juicy, no notable spiciness, grassiness, or floral overtones. This is not 60 minute IPA of course, and it's not exactly a hop bomb, but there are plenty of hops. The more you sip, the more the hops seemed to loose intensity, and the malt body and flavor was more detectable. Mouthfeel is medium with a desirable amount of carbonation. Overall, this is not my choice for an IPA, thought it's a solid version, and probably somewhat traditional despite favoring american hops rather than english or more noble hops, I gather.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,JBStith,4.03,"Victory HopDevil IPA. A solid example of the IPA style  A: Poured a deep golden, almost copper color. Nice off white head with descent retention and low lacing. Great clarity.  S: Smell was not very strong. Some malt and hops. A bit fruity, spicy, and grassy, but nothing I could readily identify.  T: Overall taste was good. Low malt backbone with strong hops and bitterness. As strong as the bitterness was, it did not become overwhelming at any point. Stronger malt presence could help balance this beer out a bit, but this is just my personal preference.  M: Medium body. Right where it should be for an IPA.  D: Drinkability is good. I had two and one sitting and enjoyed both.  I will have this again, though it is not my favorite IPA. I recommend that others try it. A solid IPA offering.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Pinto21,4.18,"a nice deep copper color that made my mouth water, as well as the smell which is hard to describe. kind of a little fruity but not much. tasted quite bitter, but with the right amount of hops. every easy to drink, since its so smooth. best IPA that ive had so far.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,phishgator,4.2,"This was poured into a pint glass with a deep copper, hazy color. The head was consistant for an IPA. The aroma is floral and citrusy. The taste is bitter up front, in the middle, and in the finish. There are flavors of pine and a slight tarty fruit(?). The body is thick and filling. On a summer day you could enjoy a few of these, but not the entire 6-pack. I would have to say that this is a great American IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,guitarmage,3.8,"Appearance: A dark, rich amber, a little light passes through, inviting off white head with great retention.  Smell: Very aromatic, nice grainy notes followed by big hops, grassy and pleasant, also fruity esters.  Taste: Very mild flavor followed by the hops, I can't place other flavors at this time.  Mouthfeel: Super creamy medium bodied, almost nitro-like. Good.  Drinkability: A very drinkable IPA and very unique. I like it, but I'm rather confused by it's flavors, it smells a lot more than it seems to taste.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,kgotcher,4.58,"Pours a hazy amber with a big pillowy offwhite head and a bit of lacing.  Smells good, mellow maltyness with a subdued earty hoppyness.  Nice smooth mouthfeel with bitter finish.  Taste is awesome, very smooth and balanced. Sweet maltyness and bitter hops blend very well and neither one seems overly noticable. Aftertaste has very intense hop bitterness flavor without being overly harsh.  In a word, smooth. After trying a few of their beers I have extreme respect for Victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,MiScusi,4.03,"Preliminary- Bought one single 12oz bottle from Hi-Time Wine Cellars in Costa Mesa, CA. Wasn't planning on drinking it just yet but I accidently cracked the bottle just a bit, so decided to pour it.  Appearance: Is a brownish/red that, with time, will turn clear. Head depends on pour of course, but a fluffy 3 finger head dissipates in about 2 minutes to 1/2 finger, which remains for quite a while. Lacing remains throughout entire time.  Smell: The smell doesn't knock you down, although it is nice and fresh. You can definitely tell this is an IPA but its not going to blow you away with exaggerated hoppiness. To me this is a plus for the style.  Taste: The taste goes through quite an evolution as you drink it. Being cold, you get big dose of bitterness through the hops which I have yet to look up what variety they are. As this thing warms up a little you get plenty of subdued malt flavor at the start which fades to hop bitterness that lingers in your mouth for quite a while. You really do know you are drinking an IPA the entire time.  Moutfeel: I like moderate carbonation in both pale ales and IPA's and this bottle seems to deliver a moderate to moderately high carbonation which is nice.  Drinkability: As far as this goes, its almost 7% alcohol so you wont be drinking a huge quantity of these, but for taking down a couple of them, its not a huge chore if you are an IPA fan. I would not even classify myself as an IPA fan (drink one every now and then) and I have enjoyed this bottle. Props to Victory.  4.5 / 4 / 4 / 4.5 / 3.5 ___ 6/25/07  Enjoy by date of 8/8/07  Nose of a bit of toasted malt and fruity. Taste up front is very berry-ish, with a bit of sweet pale malt. Finish turns into a bitter resiny hops. A light to medium strength IPA as my senses of the hop has matured.

Hops all the way through start to finish, but very complex in flavor. The finish is a tea-like bitterness that sticks on the tongue for a while.  Mouthfeel is moderately thick, nothing crazy. The hops shine through and the malt sings backup.  I could drink quite a few of these bad boys in an evening. This is one tasty little devil.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,hoffman,4.42,"This one is great....pours up nice with an off white head. The color is a hazy amber tranlucent to the light a nice appearing beer. The smell is effervecent very nice..sweet roasted malts, smokey carmel and piney hops very potent and an example of what I like to smell in a beer. The taste is quite nice as well the toasty sweet carmels are present up front and then yield to more grassy notes in the middle, a perfectly balanced hop impression finishes the beer off. Damn fine and oh so perfectly quaffable. If I could get sixers of this I would keep a case in the beer fridge standard. The mouthfeel is good possibly a bit water for the beers flavor. Amazingly drinkable....get this in mass quantities if you can.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,jockstrappy,4.48,"Pours a rich amber color with a creamy, sticky white head that retained itself almost throughout. Aroma is all about the hops!...not much malt to speak of, but still very inviting. Taste...this beer doesn't piss around! Hops dominate up front, with a slight malt background hitting the palate before the hops take over again. Finish is crisp, with a lingering hop effect. Much more balanced then I was expecting. Moderate carbonation, and medium body make for a very pleasant mouthfeel, and the only thing holding back it's drinkability is the ABV. This is a fantastic beer!!!  Edit...taste had to be a 5!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,GreenWBush,2.63,"I have pined for the opportunity to try this oft, and generally universally-lauded brew. I was afforded that opportunity at the Map Room, Chicago, Illinois.  This beer presents itself to me much darker than I had expected, an autumn-leaf red with a minimal skim. Just a few freckles of lace are observed clinging to the nonic pint as it disappears.  The nose of this beer again defies my anticipation; it is particularly faint, and not what i'd necessarily call 'hoppy'. The aroma is full of thin, bready malts and just the faintest impression of apple-like hop notes.  While this beer does carry a good amount of bitterness, I am surprised to find a very marginal amount of actual hop flavor. The malt is slightly sourdough-like and gets pummeled around by a thin, reedy and metallic bitterness. This one definetely sits on the 'dry' side of things, never really getting over that painful tea-like bitterness.  The mouthfeel of this beer is also particularly underwhelming. No real oiliness or powdery/pillowiness to speak of, just that incessant clanging bitterness and faint toasted malt. I jiggle the belly in hopes of producing a hop-burp, but nothing comes.  Perhaps my years of drinking West-coast minded IPAs has ruined my palate, but this wasn't even particularly pleasant to wade through. Again, i'd like to try this closer to the source so I can see if my plaguing negative impression of Victory beers has something to do with regional bias/freshness/transit, etc.  So far i'm 0/3 with Victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,dfried,4.17,"The appearance was quite coppery for an IPA, average off white head. The smell is of a hop bomb, a little sweet, but definitely an IPA by scent. The taste is obviously a hop bomb, but for an IPA, there is a slightly more roasted of a flavor to the malt witch balances and sweetens the beer nicely. A lot of grapefruit and citrusy tones. I am a hop head, and I have had hoppier beers, I would put this at about a 7 or 7.5 on the hop scale. Mouthfeel and drinkability were good, but nothing stood out. I could definitely sit and have more than a couple of these.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,bort11,4.36,"12 oz bottle courtesy of sulldaddy. Awsome devil face made out of hops on the label. Poured into an Imperial pint glass. Clear red/orange color. Strong dark tan head that took about 8 minutes to recede to a sticky head. One of the nicest looking beers I've seen. This beer is all about the hops. The smell is a strong citrusy hops, with just the slightest sweet malt around the edges. Tastes is a stong puckery hops. Piney and grassy. Medium bodied with a balanced carbonation. I believe this falls under the category of hop-bomb. This was really good for a BBQ. If you really like hops, then this is a beer for you.

Hop explosion, it's difficult to smell anything but the hops...there is a heavy fruit scent that is more apparent after your first taste.  The taste is: HOPS! Yum. Thick feeling in the mouth, followed by the grapefruit flavor. The hops balance perfectly with the sweetness...just like an IPA ought. Definite malt overtones and nice, spicy bite of a finish.  This is a good beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Erdinger2003,4,"The clear crisp amber color is looking good, the lacing is sticky and the head stays thin and is white and foamy.  The smell is powerful with hoppyness, so hoppy I can't smell anything else. Some slight amounts of dark fruit of some kind are pushing through.  The taste has more fruityness, I'm tasting some orange along with a big hoppy taste. The nose is excactly the same as the initial taste.  The mouthfeel is a bit watery and cool in texture, it goes down nicely and is a little bit better than water.  I would love to get my hands on this at the brewery itself to find out the differences that were created as it went through being distributed.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,bigdeuce,3.86,"This one is really hoppy, no doubt. Looks beautifully outta the bottle, big lacing down the glass. Nice micro smell!

The taste is strong and, like the smell, complex as hell. Its almost overpowering there is so much going on. Its tasty, but almost spicy. Very interesting. It feels nice in the mouth, almost think and dances on the tounge. The drinkablity of this beer is suspect. For me it bites a little too much to be an everyday beer. One, maybe two and move on to something cheaper. Bottom line- Tasty and spicy. Very interesting beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,acehart1,5,"Boy am I lucky. I got to enjoy this amazing beer when I went to the brewery (which is something I highly recommend to other beer-lovers).  I have had this beer on draught and in the bottle and I must say that enoying it from the cask just heightened the beer experience for me. I would rate this as one of my three or four favorite beers of all-time (and definitely my favorite single IPA).  A - Deep orange/brown color. Unfiltered with a slight head.  S- Strong, strong citrus smell.  T - I couldn't ask for more out of an IPA as it maintains a perfect blend between the hoppiness and the citrus element of the beer.  M - Very smooth. Not overwhelming at all.  D - A nice balance. I really enjoyed this one.

Bitterness takes up residence on the palate early and doesn't relinquish its hold. Hop flavors turn sweet and juicy, combining with resinous elements that affirm this ale's status as a hop monster.  If this is the Devil, consider me Damned, and Damned proud of it!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

There is a strong lemon presence.  The flavor is of citrusy hop flavor. There is a nice breath of lemon after the swallow. It's quite a refreshing beer.

Some light berry notes in the background. I like it.  Mouthfeel is good, not a lot of carbonation. I could drink about 2 of these at a time, then I would have to switch to something a little less hoppy.

345,1005,IntriqKen,3.79,"Poured a light reddish amber with a nice full 2 finger head that leaves nice lacing as it melts. Aroma is pure fresh hops and lemon. Very faint sweaty sock smell unfortunately. I've tried and tried to find this fresh on the west coast...everything up time now has been past BEST BY date on the bottle. This one's BEST BY date is a month past so I know the sock smell isn't intentional.,but it is the freshest I've been able to find out here in 6 months of searching. It's unfortunate that they can't get this beer to California fresher. Taste is Fresh grassy hops with slight citrus overtones. Finishes to a clean hop dryness. Very refreshing if you can acquire it fresh. **** Re-evaluated after a fresh sample received from blitheringidiot. Thank you very much Ev. Still everything I said before...not quite the hop-bomb people call it, but then I've had a lot of Stone and a lot of Hopcycle from Moylan's and they definately have some hop-bombs. However, I don't think that is what Victory is aiming for with Hop Devil. It's a great IPA...very, very hoppy....and very very drinkable. The problem with most ""hop-bombs"" is that they have to make them with lots of malts to achieve a balance. Often this makes them a little too sweet to be 'drinkable'. Hop devil achieves the supper hoppiess without the extra sweetness. Good job. Good brew",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,wingnutter,4.1,"Aquired from Riggsy in a trade. Poured a hazy amber color into a standard pint glass. Controlled pour didnt yield much of a head. Smells hoopy and citrusy.  Tastes like it smells. Nice hop bitterness - tangy citrus leading the way. Nice sweetness underneath and in the finish. Goes down pretty easily, and the mouthfeel is medium. The sweetness shows up more as it starts to warm. Nicely balanced. Would go perfect with chips and salsa (heavy on the cilantro!)  Drinkability is quite high - very smooth beer. Worthy of being a top 10 IPA? Not sure.

345,1005,NolateM,4.32,"Poured into a mug. Pretty dark for an IPA - it's almost brown, slightly orange-amber, and you can just barely see through it. Pours a fairly generous, off-white head. Not much lacing.  The aroma is wonderful... you can smell its strong hop character of course, plus some citrusy tones. The taste is pretty much the same. Starts off kind of bitter (in a good way) and hoppy, and then there's this refreshing citrus tinge at the end. Not quite as acidic as an IPA like Smuttynose, but still got a bit of it on the finish. Quite well-carbonated. Very easy to drink, even though you can kinda taste the 6.7%-ness.  This is definitely one of my new favorites.

Smell: Pungent citrusy aroma with a hint of pine  Taste: The name fits - hop flavor and bittnerness throughout. A little fruity upfront, followed by a roasted maltiness. Nice balance..sweetness followed by bitterness. A rather complex finish - A little bitter, a little sweet, a little roasty. A good combination of the entire affect.  Mouthfeel: Thin to medium. I think the thinness is good for this beer. Good level of carbonation.  Drinkability: This may have overwhelming hop flavor, but the thinness of the beer could allow some to get carried away.

The taste was very hopy as expected from something called the HopDevil, but not quite as hopy as I expected...these hops had the citrusy flavor that was in the smell, but also a spicy herbal flavor as well. The hops were predominant, but at the finish there was really nice malt balance. So this is one of the better IPA's that I have tried...the color was beautiful...higher carbonation than what I have come to expect from the style...lots of flavor.

Aroma is dominated by citrusy/grapefruit hops. There is a slight bit of caramel malt in the background.  Taste is slightly malty upfrot that is quickly washed over by a wave of hops. The hop flavors are citrusy with some distinct grapefruit tones. However, the flavor is not overpowering nor is the bitterness. It is quite well balanced and even has a bit of malt at the finish.

345,1005,DrJay,4.42,"It had been a while since I tried this beer, so it seemed like a good place to start on my first trip to the Victory brewpub since moving to the area (yesterday). And how was I going to say no to it on cask?  It produced superb, thick rings of lace and was a rich amber colour, but a little on the murky side. The grapefruit aroma was very pronounced and a little sharp compared to what I remember from the bottled version. The same grapefruit character was in the flavour as well, along with a very solid, caramel, malty backbone to balance the ample bitterness. It felt very full in the mouth as well - I was a little surprised since many beers I've tried on cask seem a little thinned out without the extra carbonation. Overall, quite excellent! I'm sure the guys back in Toronto will be jealous.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

A little hops in the nose. Flavor was nice smooth caramel and grapefruit. A little spice maybe clove or anise. I felt it had a very good blend that went down smooth.

Felt like DFH 90 Minute's little brother. Considerably more drinkable though. A great sessionable hop bomb with plenty of character. SO glad Victory is here in WI.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,krberg,3.66,"Dark copper with a slightly off-white head. Mouth-watering.  Suprisingly malty smelling. Sweet malt with flower-like hop aromas.  Full, rich malt backbone. Bitterness that comes to meet the malt and just tops it enough to provide a slight lingering bitterness. Flavor hops to round out the package. Delicious.  Full mouthfeel, but a lot of it comes from CO2. I'd like to try it naturally conditioned to get a better sense of the beer behind the carbonation.  Smooth and tasty. Very drinkable.  An old favorite. A wonderful (and missed) east coast IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,gqfiji,4.14,"a: unfortunately i let this one cool too long and came close to freezing it, BUT had the copper/amber color and a nice head that lasted with a hazy clarity  s: the usual hoppy smell  t: swift taste of citrus to cover the palate. the tingle faded to a nice sweet hoppy and alcohol taste that lasted throughout  m: i liked the way the flavor lasted on the tongue, other beers that taste similar at first, either dried out or over flavored the palate.  d: definitely a keeper. liked this one from beginning to end and next time will get a sixer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Rezzin,3.65,A - Pours a nice amber color with a creamy beige head. Some sediment floating around but not much. Lacing in minimal.  S - Nice floral and slightly piny hop aroma with some malt sweetness.  T - Hops are there right in the beginning but there seems to be slight metallic flavor there as well. Slightly sweet with a nice dry bite at the end. More of English IPA flavor to me.  M - Fairly thin with a little mouth puckering feel to it but not too bad. Moderate to highly carbonated.  D - Not a bad IPA but I've had much better.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,kbnooshay,4.2,"This poured an awesome orange gold color with a good amount of carbonation and a decent white head that had decent retention. The aroma is most prominetly pine hops! It is also very citric. Awesome taste, obviously the hop attack is there but there is a nice maltiness there too. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy but tingly to the tounge. Kinda drying also. This is really is quite drinkable. A very simple but awesome brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,phisig137,3.88,"Hazy amber pour, with a thin head that drops into a small blanket over the top.  Aroma is filled with hops and alcohol. Citrusy, and piney, but I was surprised how much alcohol was apparent, considering the relatively low 6.7%  Flavor is very hoppy up front, with a nice malty wash towards the end. I think this is one of the more balanced american IPA's I've had.... it tastes more like an english IPA. Good hop flavor, but not a tremendous amount of bitterness or aroma.  Mouthfeel is pleasant, if not a little thin. Heavy carbonation. Drinkability is very high.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,copasetic,4.01,"Pours a slightly hazy amber, darker than many IPAs I've tried. A small head fades quickly. The aroma is complex --somewhat floral and less citrusy than American IPAs tend to be. There's also a hint of baked cookie sweetness. This taste comes through in the flavor, which is just a bit sweet and also more piney than I expected. This aspect, plus the vaguely British-seeming malt backbone made me wonder whether I was drinking a US or UK IPA. Whatever it is, it's complex and tasty. The finish is thin with a bitter hop tingle.  Yeah, I could drink this all night. Complex enough to be a beer snob and straightforward enough for a solid session beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,pvsob,4.5,"Appearance: Deep copper/amber color with a beautiful head that lasted from start to finish. Clarity was a little hazy.  Smell: Hops, Hops, Hops, and a hint of sweetness at the end.  Taste: Crisp hop flavor of citrus (grapefruit) and some pine. Just enough to pucker me up and finish me off with a slight sweetness and a long hop and alcohol finish.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, somewhat ""slippery"". The abundant carbonation added crispness and dryness to the overall feel.  Drinkability: No drawn out details here ladies and gentleman. If you see some at your local store, pick some up. HopDevil is one of the easiest drinking IPA's that I have tasted thus far. It looks great, smells great, and tastes great.  Cheers.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Metalmonk,4.18,"A great color makes this beer attractive right away: orange, red, ruby and gold all swirled together. Moderate carbonation and an inch-thick head that settled to a half-inch throughout the drink.  Instant hops on the nose, like pine. A prickly lemon scent in the background. It's just fine, but fairly common for the style with nothing unusual or unique to set it apart.  Totally solid flavors, simple and direct. Spicy and tangy. Bitter with some grapefruit pucker. Perhaps this is the ultimate definition of what a no-nonsense IPA should taste like. Victory comes up with yet another flavor with character, drinkability and a wild streak.  Mouthfeel is a pleasant creaminess up front, with a crisp nip going down the back of the mouth and throat.  Incredibly easy to drink and even easier to enjoy. I'd point this beer out as the standard example of the new American IPA. Well-hopped and drinkable every day.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,ultralarry2006,4,"Apearance: Pours a 2 inch head that recedes to half inch or so that lingers. Leaves good lacing. Is a hazy orange copper.  Smell: Piney, some citrus. Some breadiness that hangs back. Pleasingly bitter.  Taste: Pretty much as promised by aroma - hops dominate with intense pine , some citrus. Backbone of bready malt that is a little underassertive, hanging in back , tilting balance in favor of hops bitterness, but in a good way, with dry bitter aftertaste, yum! The malt also leaves an aftertaste resembling that of euro pale lagers, which is due to the fact that Victory uses european malts in this brew, which renders a unique flavor in what is presumably an American ""west-coast-style"" IPA.  Mouthfeel : Full, with more carbonation than expected which diminishes mouth a little bit. Decent slickness from hop oils.  Drinkability : Goes down very easy, and very good, could go for several more in one sitting. A tasty ale somewhat slanted to hops at the malt's expense, which I think is just what you might have wanted if you find yourself drinking this often - I know I do. However I think that this is balanced enough and tame enough to enlighten the non-hop disciple.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,riversider76,3.35,"Pours copper, with a tan, foamy head.and nice lacing. Smell is of hops,pine,and citrus, with a sweet edge. Body is medium,with some carbonation. Taste has a bitter edge,that I thought would be better balanced. The sweetness in the smell was not comming through for me. It's stright bitter from start to finish. Don't get me wrong,this is not a bad beer, but I liked Hazed and Infused much better.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,orbitalr0x,4.17,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this beer before now. The HopDevil pours into my glass a nice deep copper red with a inch of creamy, bubbly foam head on top. Good clarity. Aromas are all hops upfront, piney, spicy and a touch citric as well. A sweet caramel, midly doughy malt aroma is present as well. Candy coated green leafy hop goodness.  First sip brings a mix of piney and grapefruity citrus hops. A toasted biscuit maltiness dipped in caramel supports the weight of the hops. Tasty green, leafy bitterness flows throughout each sip balanced by a cotton candy sweetness. Finishes with a herbal bitterness that lingers on a bit. Good brew.  Mouthfeel is wonderful with a nice body and solid carbonation. Goes down all too easy, this is a great session IPA for sure and a great six pack choice for heading out to a party. I'm a little upset that I overlooked the HopDevil for so long. Another brew from Victory that's not to be missed.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Freshie,4.22,"Appearence is a very cloudy amber color, with small head.  The aroma is very pungent with hops.  The taste is very bitter with hops in abundance. There is a spice that comes with the taste that puts a little zip on your tongue. The hop taste stays with you with a mild alcohol burn  Not an ale with a lot of levels, but it does not need any. The one is fine on its own.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

In bottle it still is one of the staples in my fridge. Still a beautiful beer, still that wonderful citrusy hops aroma backed by solid malts and some pine, and the taste is nicely well-rounded and balanced.

Kinda like a homebrew with chill haze, but the head. The head never leaves. Wow. Wow. It's amazing.  And the smell. Hops. Juicy, delicious hops. Oh man. That's what I've been looking for. The taste follows the smell. Resiny, spicy, and bitter bitter bitter. There is just enough malt lingering in the background to prevent the beer from being hop mouthwash, but that's it.

345,1005,sinistermadman,3.61,"From notes: Classic IPA aesthetic - gilded amber, slightly cloudy. Small head from pour which quickly settles to a fine lacing. Smell is mild, no pleasant pungent hop aroma, subtle malt. Mouthfeel is smooth, some malt grit, mild hop bitterness. Mild hop bitterness which tapers to a chalky, oily finish.  This brew seems unbalanced, somewhat chaotic. Haphazard malt balance even for an IPA. Alcohol astringency is more evident than hop bitterness. I guess I'm in the minority, but there are plenty of other more interesting offerings for this style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

S: Mostly citrus and pine, with a little sweet malt in the background.  T: Lots of American hop flavour here, but it's a nice blend (citrus, floral & pine with a little earth in the aftertaste). There seems to be an underlying malt sweetness, but this ones certainly balanced to the bitter side. Quite refreshing, and I wouldn't have suspect the alcohol was this high.  M: Moderate body is a little oily & acidic. Moderate carbonation has a prickly, thirst-quenching feel.  D: As long as you like American hops, this is very drinkable. The alcohol content will catch up to you though!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,geexploitation,4.25,"I'm usually more into IPAs that are well balanced between malt and hops... HopDevil isn't too balanced, but the hop character in the beer is so pleasing that I'll make an exception. This beer pours a very bright amber with a decent, foamy head that dissipates only after a while. The nose is big and fruity with hops, and they have an acidic bite to them that packs a real wallop. Underneath the hops is a slight bready malt aroma. The palate is extremely bitter, with the hops assaulting the tongue immediately. The hops flavors are quite bitter but not acridly so. There's very little malt balance to this beer, but the hop flavors are good enough to compensate. The mouthfeel is quite smooth in spite of the hop burst. I'm really impressed. Victory succeeds again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Tastes sweet malt for about one second; then the hops kick in and it's grapefruit-rind time...alcohol is right there too....tames a bit on warming. Mouthfeel is medium ....carbonation medium. One will be enough for me. I think I'd like this better if there was just a little more sugar to balance the hops.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Taste: Fantastic flavors bursting in my mouth like no other.Citrusy and piney hops are definitely there,but caressed with a nicely sweetened malt that keeps you coming for more.A sour apple, candied oranges, and a not too potent alcohol mingle themselves in this fine brew.  Mouthfeel: This silky, smooth liquid brushes by my tongue with such elegance,I almost dont even notice the sweet bubbley finish.This beer also creates a thin film in my mouth that tastes like everything ive described for you so far.

345,1005,bignick,4.62,"This is one of my all-time favoite beers. I will be forever indebted to Victory for providing me with this one. It is certainly very hoppy, but the balance of the different hops in it are what makes it so special. It is citrusy but not completely over the top. There is enough of a malt backbone to make it extremely drinkable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Stays around most of the way, leaving some lacing but not a ton.  S - not a huge hop aroma considering the taste of this beer. Some spicy, floral notes backed up by some light toffeeish aromas. Smells a little like fresh cut grass.  T - sharp, intense bitterness, but not a lot of hop flavor. Most of the hops went into the boil at bittering here, it seems. Bitterness hits the tip of your tongue first. Only in the aftertaste or tail end of the swallow can you pick up much malt substance. What malt is there is reminiscient of fresh dough, biscuits, toffee. Grassy, spicy hop flavors predominate, some citrus. This is tasty, but I'm taking off points because it seems unbalanced. Hops win this beer battle easily. Alcohol aromas and flavors not present.  M - medium thin, carbonation is average. Some hop oil stickiness in there.  D - very tasty beverage, and something I would never turn down. Just disappointed in the unbalanced aspect of this brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Dissapointed with these characteristics but it does have a nice sharp initial taste followed by a nice smooth hoppy finish. It is very drinkable and enjoyable. It was a rather lighter filtered IPA. It does pack a punch at 6.7%abv. I had tried this beer a few years back and it tasted less hoppy than I remember it. I am not that impressed with this beer. I wll ha ve to make it a point to try some of the other Victory brewery beers. I have heard good things about them.

345,1005,DaggerEyes,4.13,"Hop Devil pours a hazy golden amber with a lacy head. It is extremely viscous and sticky, clinging to the walls of the glass after each sip.  The nose has a very strong grapefruit scent with spicy hints. The scent of the hops are ever present.  This has a bold and sharp taste with strong citrus over tones. Very hoppy and spicy, and when mixed with the carbonation this creates a very exciting beer for the mouth. This beer is so complex in it's flavor I'm at a loss for words which will describe it well. A complete assult on your taste, and after the wonderful taste battle that ensures in your mouth, the after taste lingers like smoke on the battle field for quite some time.

Really doesn't look a lot different than many IPAs, but I like the look.  S - Smells like hops, and a lot of them. Upon first sniff, I would have guessed double IPA. Malts? Couldn't find them if they are there.  T - Kickass. Hoppy as all hell. Bitter from first sip until well after it is swallowed. This bite lasts a lot longer than I am used to. I love it. Not a lot of malts in the taste either, but this is an IPA. It's just fine for the style  M - Just the right amount of carbonation and a great medium feel. I like it.  D - It's too hoppy to really throw back in large quantities, but is great for having one or two with a nice dinner.  O - GREAT example of what an IPA should be. I'd recommend to anyone who is a fan of the style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,guinnessdoc,4.65,"This was the beer that turned me on to American craft beer. When I had it on tap at Tyler's Taproom in Durham, NC the other night I realized it was finally time to review it.  Served in a pint glass through which I could see the clarity and copper color of this beer.  The aroma is all hops - citrus & maybe a little piney - but it's not overwhelming. In my opinion, it's enticing.  From the first sip to the last, it's all citrus & pine hops with just a hint of malty sweetness. This is the beer that introduced me to hops and when I first had it years ago, I thought there was no way anyone could get more hops in a beer. Now I realize how there's actually some balance in there. Each sip left a slight hop bitterness that lasted until the next one.  I still like this beer as much as I did the first time I had it - maybe more.

Aroma is slightly pine with a touch of grass and earth. Not as predominantly hops as you would expect from something called Hopdevil.  Taste is hops upfront. Just like the aroma, grass and earth with the bitterness and pine coming more to the front. Throughout the sip, the malt is with you just behind the main flavors but peaking out to the front seemingly randomly. Aftertaste is a mild, pleasant bitterness.  The last time I drank this I was going to review but noticed the date was a little past. I held off until this one, but Ive got to say they did not taste much different. A good beer. It seems to lean into the American Amber Ale category at times.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,UncleFlip,4.35,"Nice hazy deep honey colour with some peach overtones. Head is light tan, about one finger. It falls at a decent rate, eaving some thick wet lace behind.  For one called Hop Devile, the hops are oddly not the big impression in the aroma.. It's a very floral, fruity malt aroma, mainly- full of orange and a touch of black licorice. There's sme hop under, but it is not the main attraction here.  Ok, here's where the hop hits...that fruity, malty flavour hits up front, followed by a sucker punch of hops- not too sharp, not too floral- just right. After delivering the blow, the hops quickly go back to their corner...  Carbonation hits low and tight, and rolls back the tongue. There's a medium liquid over it. Feels good on the tongue.  Quite good; very balanced. An easy drinker that would be a regular in my beer closet if I could get it here.  Be well -UF",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Tastes a bit like cascades, too. Pretty bitter at the back and end. A bite to that. A fine brew. I'd like to see it come out more even on the tongue. The tangy aftertaste - all over the sides and back of the mouth - could probably be cut a bit with (gasp) a bit more sweetness to it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Pours out a coppery, slightly-cloudy color, with good-sized off-white head that holds pretty well and leaves a nice lace.  Smell is hoppy, but not abrasively so, with floral grapefruit notes coming in on a solid backbone of bready malts.  Flavor is also quite hoppy, with more of a pronounced pine flavor to go with a nice bitter grapefruit citric twang. The spicy flavors come through clearly, but so does the malt, which is bready with slight caramel flavors.  Overall: For a local IPA, or any kind of IPA, you can't beat this one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,timtheenchanta,4.68,Dark color... simliar to watered down honey. It's a light brown with hints of yellow. Nice head rises from the liquid after the pour. Loads of lacing down the glass. Plenty of hops on the nose that are very citrusy. Hint of grainy malt. There's something else that's sweet. Perhaps it's just the malt. Hops steal the show from the very beginning of the taste. They are very spicy and a tad fruity. There's really not enough malt flavor to mention. I don't give a damn though because this beer is tasty enough without perfect balance! Creamy mouthfeel with absolute bitterness in the finish. Immediately after swallowing the hops are easy and not too bad but you wait five seconds and they attack. Wow. This is a great beer. Victory has brought me so much hoppy delight lately. I feel like I should give them something in return.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Smell was very citrusy, with loads of grapefruit flavors as well as some grassy earth tones here and there as well. You could also smell a nice spicy aroma from the hops that lent itself well to the overall presence of this beer. Taste was excellent...hop presence was exceptionally executed with prickly spices and earth flavors gliding in and around the palate. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, any lighter or heavier and i think they would have overdone it a bit. This beer will certainly challenge the palate, but I would not call this a difficult beer to drink.

The flavor of robust hoppiness dominates, but I would say its not overdone. The malt carries a nice sweetness to balance things out, and the alcohol stays well hidden. Finish has a slight dryness. Mouthfeel is nice, medium thick, and finishes rich and bubbly. This one went down easy, and sadly its the only one I have.

It's good, yes, but subtle.  Mmmm, its a very light citrus flavor but almost overwhelmingly bitter both during and after the taste. I don't notice carbonation.  That bitterness in the aftertaste embelishes the bitterness of the next mouthfull. While I tend to want more and more bitterness, it reaches it's limit. The beer is basically telling you to slow down.  It's my opinion that a hopped up American beer should attack all five senses (ok 4, and in a good way) this one stands it's ground, and one time I considered it my favorite.

I've had this several times, including a quite a few recently. Am I missing something?  To start, it's a fine beer, a quality IPA that was quite enjoyable. But with the accolades this gets I expect it to be something spectacular. Even more so since it's an IPA, one of the finest styles around, in my opinion.  I guess the main missing link for me is the use of hops. This has never hit me as an absurdly hoppy beer. I fucking love hops. This falls more into citrus hopland, and I'm a piney / floral kinda jabroni.

345,1005,loren01,4.62,"Recieved in trade with shark262, thanks much for this one!! A: Pours a copper color with lots of frothy white head. Lots of lacing sticking down the sides of the glass. S: Smells very citrusy and spicy. There is also a very well balanced malt scent. T: Very very hoppy flavored, yet suprisingly malty for as hop flavored as it was. The end is very bitter but not in a bad way at all. Nicely balanced. Tastes very fresh out of the bottle like I'm sitting right at the brewery. M: Goes down very easily, perfectly carbonated, slight bitter mouthfeel. D: Overall this is an excellent IPA, one of the better ones I've had in quite some time.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,bjohnson,4.32,"A: Pours a cloudy orangey amber color with a foamy white half finger head that leaves great lace.  S: Aromas of fruity, floral and piney hops dominate the nose. VERY hoppy! Smells very fresh.  T: Tastes of floral and piney hops are the most dominating with a slight matly flavor in the background, but ever slo slight. Very bold and well balanced IPA with a nice dry bitter finish.  M & D: Mouthfeel on this beer is very very good. Dry and bitter finish is very inviting and welcomed. Drinkability on this offering from Victory is very high. The 6.7% abv is noticeable as it warms your belly. Great beer any time of the year. Victory has done it again--this and the hop wallop are two of the better IPAs I've had.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Ieatlambfries,4.72,"I've reviewed this brew a few times, but was not expecting such a difference in the cask version. If I could only have it one way for the rest of my life, this would be it.  Color was an opaque copper orange. Not much head or carbonation. But, the color was stunning.  I don't know where to begin with the smell. Up front sweet flowery orange blossoms. Unlike any previous experience with this beer. Usually I smell a cascade hop resin smell. But this was different. Very citrus and piney. But instead of grapefruit, it was pure orange.  Taste was upfront bitter orange rinds. Very distinctive. A departure from the usual cascade flavors. Flowery blossom honey in the background. Perfectly balanced.  Mouthfeel seemed denser than usual. Very little carbonation made it smooth, and could have contributed to the denser feeling. Less crisp, but very satisfying.  Drinkability was exceptional. I could drink this forever. The best IPA I've tasted to date. My only regret is they would not sell a growler of this at Victory. I highly recommend this if you can get to the brewery.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Slightly murky, copper color with light carbonation bubbles and light lacing.  Super hoppy resin, sativa like smell, a hop lovers delight. Good malt flavor, slightly nutty taste, with a pine and floral crisp, clean finish. This is one fine , hoppy ale!  Fresh, clean mouthfeel with abundant hop aftertaste, makes this moderately strong brew very drinkable, think I'll have another....cheers.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,skillerified,3.11,"Nice color. Paints the glass in delicious looking amber, red and orange hues. About a finger on the head and it seems to be sticking around. Solid lacing. Some slow moving carbonation is visible too. About as appetizing looking a beer as I can remember. Seems a little darker than some other IPAs I've tried.  The sniffer likes this one. A good balance of pine, lemon and other citrus scents. A distinctly hoppy scent. Just a hint of spice too. Smells delicious.  Taste somehow seems really weak to me. I'm not getting much beyond a faint caramel flavor at the finish. Just a hint of pine spice in there too. Am I missing something? This doesn't seem right. It's not that it tastes bad, it just doesn't taste like much of anything. Quite a disappointment.  Extremely smooth and mellow mouthfeel. I was really surprised by that. A good balance of bitter and sweet. Not much finish though.  I can't help but feel I've missed something in the taste department. I have another bottle that I'll use as a comparison later and edit this if necessary, but there's just nothing there. Really disappointing. I really like the mouthfeel. It's surprising for an IPA, but is that enough to keep drinking these? I doubt it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Nice, sweet lightly roasted malt, varied hop bouquet of rind and citrus and grassiness, not overpowering.  Bitterly hoppy, malt barely shows through, more in the nose than the taste. Rindy lemony hoppiness. Medium bodied, lasting sharp bitterness. semi-strong carbonation.  One bitter beer, not much for balance on this one. Taste is enjoyable, spicy, maybe aging could smooth it out. I would not have guessed as high as 6.7%.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Calico,4.12,"I almost think I like this better than their Hop Wallop.  Poured very clear amber-red with nice lacing.  Nose quite hoppy. I was trying to determine which hops. Cascade or Columbus or Brewer's Gold or what. Also a bit of sugary, mapley malt in the nose. Not much but a trace.  I began drinking and it was a marvelous balance of malt and hops - perfect sweet-bitter combination. Vermont maple syrup tempered with California hop juice. Added to with what only yeast can do.  Suffice to say that I cannot adequately describe this beer. I love Brooklyn East India Pale Ale, Southern Tier IPA, Redhook IPA, Snake Dog IPA, and Lake Placid Frostbite, but this tops them all in my opinion. Not one to cellar (that's its elder brother Hop Wallop) but one to drink on tap and buy in bottles.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Taste is interesting as well- earthy and bitter hops at the forefront, immediately followed by an almost intense malty breadyness. Hints of sweetness hit the palate at odd times, but otherwise it's a tasty thing. Mouthfeel is pretty nice as well. Frothy and bubbly, chewy, smooth. A solid IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,JayQue,4.22,"After reading a few reviews, I was probably expecting too much. This is a good but not exceptional IPA. It pours a cloudy copper color with a small off -white head that dissipates quickly. Leaves a fair amount of lacing on the glass. The smell is exceptional, nice and rich hops/citrus aroma. The taste is good but not great. Good hops taste, good bitterness and balanced flavor. What it doesn't have is the ""wow"" factor I experienced with my first Hop Otten, SN Pale Ale or SN Celebration Ale. This is still a very drinkable ale. There are just a few out there that I prefer more.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,nlmartin,3.85,Poured from the bottle into a pub glass.  Appearance: The beer pours a clear amber coloration. The head was light honey coloration. Minimal lacing left behind on the glass.  Smell: A nice fruity malty introduction going to piney spicy hops.  Taste: The beer leads in with a slightly butter bready maltyness. This gives way to some citrus and then finally to the spicy hops.  Mouthfeel: The beer is light bodied plus. Slightly oily feeling to the palate.  Drinkability: This is a good effort for a IPA. This mayeven be a good introduction to the style. I will introduce my father in law to this one.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,johnniemarg,3.79,"Pours a nice amber with a small tan head. No lacing.  The smell is not so much hops but toasted malt and cherries.  It's been a while since I had this because I remembered there being more hop flavor. Mostly I get a strong flavor of toasted malt, followed by a fruity cherry flavor that finally gives way to the hops at the end. The hops stay on your palate for a long time after you take a sip. I don't like the flavor of the hops in this beer as much as some of my favorite IPAs (Southern Tier, Cascazilla, etc.). Good beer though.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Doesn't lace too well.  The smell is of bold spicy, herbal hops. Only a gentle caramel malt detected below. The taste is very similar but more intense. The bitterness is definitely there.

345,1005,Terp96,3.8,"Had this on many occasion but this is my first official review.  Pours a hazy, deep orange-amber color with a decent sized one finger head that actually disappears by mid glass.  Smell is of sweet malt and pine. Though the hops are very prevalent, you can tell this is more than just the hop bomb the name suggests.  Taste is interesting. Very malty up front. One can expect this from a much darker than normal IPA. Almost sugary sweet. The hops quickly emerge leaving a very dry, bitter finish. Although this beer is not overly big on Alcohol, you can taste it after a while.  Mouthfeel is where this beer is lacking. I remember this being thicker and more balanced than it was this time. The beer grew increasingly thin as I progressed.  Overall drinkability is okay. I have drunk this beer in session but it does become too drying and the alcohol taste becomes ever more present as you go along.  In closing, I am not sure this beer is really an IPA. It seems a little too sweet and darker than most IPAs I have had. Not sure it is an APA either. If it weighed in over 7%, I think it would fit right in a Strong Ale category.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,PBRstreetgang,4.32,"Pours a slightly hazed orange amber hue. Two finger head slowly reduces to a very dense and creamy cap that will remain throughout. Scarce specs of lacing. Cascade and Chinook hops in the nose, citrus and pine scent, and some backgroung crystal malts give it a well-rounded aroma. Begins with a sweet caramel taste, followed by a delicious orange rind and pine sap bitterness. The malt character is mild, but appropriate and balanced for the style. Medium in body with fine carbonation that helps release hop oils from the tounge. Dry aftertaste, with a herbal hop tea flavor. Finish is similiar; timidly abrasive, but friendly enough for a comfortable drinkability.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

It smells like, wellhops and little bits of devil (what did you expect?)! It also has a hint of grapefruit and pine.  A very bold taste. It tastes like bitter hops, citrus and pine. It has hints of malt in the background and a nice floral aftertaste. A light spiciness lingers on the tongue.  This is a must have for hop-heads. It is a good beer. I am not particularly fond of overly hopped beers, but this one is turning me to the dark side. The label is awesome by the way.

Nose is evenly split between floral pine and sweet grapefruit.  Entry is nice withy carbonation lightly brushing the sides of the tongue with a mouthfeel a little thinner than I'm used to with an IPA. Midtaste hits the sweet spot with a nice pale malt and grapefruity hops.  The finish stings the back of the mouth with a pleasant, clean hop jolt that fades with the same pine / citrus ratio promised by the nose.

Hits you with a bit of bitterness, alright- definitely a little on the coarse side, but not too much. I must have a slightly older body, the general hop flavor is less pronounced than the bitterness; it's all bitter citrus peel here. A little malt underneath to balance things out; a bit of toast grain flavor as well. Feels nice in the mouth- not too thick or thin. Easy enough to drink, but not sure I'd crave another. Pretty darn good for the style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,beermanbrian,3.38,Pours a deep cloudy brownish amber with a nice big white head. Good retention and nice lacing. Smell is piney and also a little nutty. The hops bitterness takes over the taste but it isn't the typical citrus/pine hops. Definately more spicey and nutty than what i would expect from an ipa. The bitterness sticks with you but not a good way. I can see how this would appeal to some but not what I look for in an ipa at all. One of the few dissapointments I've had from Victory.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,akahn,3.68,"Pours a deep hazy red-amber with a nice big frothy off-white head. Lot's of skinny lace.  Big fresh hoppy, juicy aroma.  Bitter sharp and dry hop taste. Sharp carbonation to match. As it warms up, hop spiciness translates into an alcohol bite.  Comparison time: This beer is less light, floral and fruity than Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA and less ""hearty"" than Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale. This seems to be a spicier take on this style. My pick of these three would be DFH 60 Minute. I like my beers a bit more subtle than this one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Gagnonsux,4.03,"The color is dark copper with lots of carbonation. The large, thick head is off-white. Aroma is of a citrussy hop on top of sweet malt. As for the taste, piney hops jump out first but are soon taken over by a distinct pineapple flavor. Bitterness is very strong. An underly sweetness mixes in nicely. The overall IPA flavor here is a little different than most that I've sampled, the bitterness is a bit intrusive, still I really enjoyed HopDevil, but its not my favorite. This is something I'll pick up again, just to see if I can find out what the fuss about.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,HugoGrim,4.68,"Poured from the bottle into an imperial pint. Freshness date says ""enjoy by 22 2006"" which is three months from now. I assume it is very fresh, because it is from a six pack I purchased from the Victory brewery along with a pack of Storm King Stout which says it was bottled 12/13/2005 (2 weeks ago).  The body is a deep orange/red color, much darker than other IPAs I've had. Quite cloudy. The head is very thick and foamy and leaves very nice lace down the glass.  I've had this on tap and the smell is not as full out of the bottle, but it is still sporting a rich hop and flowery aroma.  Flavor can be described in one word... intense. The name says it all, this beer is all about hops. Spicy, acidic hops dominate your mouth. The bitterness starts moderate and grows until the finish which ends even stronger than it started. Carries a slight dryness which I really enjoy.  Drinkability is near perfect. It's a very intense flavored beer, which usually is not a great thing for drinkability, but this doesn't seem to be the case here. The ABV is near perfect in my opinion at 6.7%.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Very nice, bitter taste with some hints of malt. Not overpowering or cloying as I found SNCA to be.  Great bitter finish that cleansed the palate and then left the mouth feeling clean and refreshed.  I liked this much more than SNCA.  Will definitely try this again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Frozensoul327,3.78,"Another good brew from Victory. Pours out to a medium amber color with a short lived head. Lace is present in organized rings. Nice. Aroma is (gasp!) very hoppy, with some minor hints of malt and grain. Taste is very hoppy, yet not overpowering to the point that you want to cringe. Flavors of hops, sweet floral notes, mild malts and dry grain go rather well over the palate. Mouthfeel is slightly oil. I like that with the hoppy beers. Drinkability is pretty good.

345,1005,becktone,4,"Hopdevil pours to be a hazy amber/orange color. It has a nice medium sized head to begin with but it slowly recedes to a smaller stable head. The lacing along the sides of the glass also make this beer look appetizing. When agitated the lacing becomes thicker and the rest of the head gains a little size to. Basically ddead retention isn't spectacular.  The aroma of this beer can be described as flowery. These aromas and other hop aromas are easily detected. I also noticed that this IPA doesn't smell quite the same as the others that I've had, just something different about it. It could be that it lacks the strong citrus aroma that is apparent in so many others.  The taste of this beer is strongly influenced by hops, the flowery aroma obviously comes from the flowery taste of this beer. It is a fairly bitter beer and is mainly hop influenced. However, I do taste a roasted barley/grain flavor in the aftertaste. This is a good beer and definitely above average, but I prefer Sone or SNCA over this one.  This beer has a medium body and goes down pretty smooth. The carbonation seems high at first when it is felt on the front of the tongue, but as it sits in the mouth longer and when swallowed the perceptable level of carbonation considerably drops. This beer is good and I would buy it agian but I prefer Stone and SNCA when it comes to IPAs.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,Phatz,3.65,"The is a very bold beer, to be adored, praised, (worshiped? - maybe ,maybe not) by all the Hop Heads out there. I, however, am not one of those people. I have never been a big fan of the Alpha Acidy, green bitter, super hoppy flavor. As a BA advocating beer, of all styles, I realize I need to broaden my horizons to include IPAs as well as Stouts etc. So I am evaluating this beer based on a combination of personal taste and what the style is supposed to be.  Appearance: Poured (appropriately) into my Victory pint glass; it pours an amber/copper with a 2 finger tight white head.  Smell: Citrus, hops, a slightly soapy characteristic, then a nice sweet malty base.  Taste: The spiciness I like. It is incredibly hoppy and green. I think that is exactly what this beer is going for though. Underneath all that bitterness is a small nice sweetness in a malt base. I like the alcohol peeping through. (like a spiced grass tea, in vodka) Very dry bitey aftertaste. The aftertaste is so pronounced, that 5 minutes later you can still feel the hops on you tongue and 10 minutes later you still taste hops in the back of your throat. I guess thats a good thing if you love the flavor of hops on your tongue, so I am giving this a 3.5 for taste. If you are not a fan of the burn-y, prickly, sudsy hop flavor then; well... thats obvious ... don't drink a beer called 'Hop' Devil.  Mouthfeel: Working very hard, I could almost get past the biting hops to notice the nice smooth medium body mouthfeel. I really did not gain much in the experience from the mouthfeel though because I wanted to get the stuff swallowed and off my aching tongue as quickly as possible. Oh yeah, being open minded about hoppy beers, forgot. Anyway a nice mouthfeel - 4.0  Drinkability: Knowing that I am not a huge personal fan of this style I am trying to be generous, but I certainly would not want more than one of these. A bit of sharp cheddar cheese along with the beer made this a just barely enjoyable (thats a positive) way to consume 6.7 % ABV of alcohol. Clearly, this is a beer made for the Hop Heads. Enjoy.  Hope this is helpful. Cheers!  --- EDIT I have been broadening my horizons and expanding my palate into the world of hops in the last several moths. I have come back to this beer and now find what used to be overwhelming, quite refreshing. Maybe I should start over again but I have found that now I really like Hop Devil. ---",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,PeatReek,4.07,"Nice pour, plenty of offwhite head that had some staying power.  Aroma: definitely some solid hop smells here, but I'm actually more struck by how well you can smell the malts. Very bready, this much malt smell means it's gonna be strong.  Taste: Hops are more pronounced here, but the malts are also quite strong, a nice balance. Bitterness comes through late in the sip and that's nice too.  Mouthfeel: Nice and thick, about as I expected after that big malt smell.  Drinkability: just fine. Low score mostly related to my own tendency to stop after 1 extremely hoppy beer. It's a good one, though.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,acrawf6,4.22,"What a good beer. I wish i could pick this one up locally, but its just not the case around here. Got this in houston.  Pours out a rich ruby red and rusty orange. appears hazy because it is not transparent, however its hard for me to say it is hazy... just looks very potent. Slight orangish head, about an inch. ring stays around the glass through the whole beer. good lacing too.  Smell is good. I get a sweetness initially with the hops. its a natural sweetness like honey.  Taste is quite impressive. This is not one i could drink everyday though because it just seems too much. It has a very raw taste to it. A very earthy hoppy flavor, and very bitter. I get some sweetness like powder sugar. some alcohol bite comes out at the end.  Mouthfeel is quite creamy for a beer i think taste so raw. Medium carbonation. Chewy too. I am actually moving my jaw as if i am eating this beer.  Overall a great beer, but not one i could drink all night or everyday, but thats just me. But it is quite a treat and a great one to change things up when you want to get a little festive.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

S: citrus fruits and hops T: This beer bites you at the beginning and has a touch of malty sweetness at the end. The hops stay in your mouth a long time after the beer has made it's way down your esophogus(sp?). M: Mouthfeel is crisp and dry. D: very drinkable if you like the style. This is one of my favorite beers regardless of style. I simply can't get enough of HopDevil.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,icefisherman,1.88,ok well i will be the first to tell you im not a big ipa fan but i pulled this at mystery beer so i drank it at mystery beer. it started off ok it looked like a good beer it smelled like a ok beer and then all hell broke loose it taste verry verry hoppy not my style at all more hoppy then any other ipa ive had which ads to the mouth feel of a thousand razorblades slicing my tonge i think i would rather drink corona than this cheap gypsy swill again,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,sinistrsam,4.15,"Wonderful white foamy head atop a dark amber body. It had exceptional retention and mild carbonation. It smelled very sweet and very floral. The taste what what you would expect from an IPA, somewhat malty and sweet, with extreme hoppiness. It had a good mouthfeel, and finished very sweet and crisp, almost refreshing. I am a fan of this beer but I wouldn't say it was one of the best IPA styles I've ever had.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,cracgor,4.12,"Probably one of the better American IPAs I have had lately...only a little under hopped. It is a copper colored beer with a light colored long standing head. The beer smells awesome. It has a great sweet, piney, western hop smell to it. However, when I taste into the beer it is just not as strong a hop. The malts kick up on it. It brings a lot of balance to the beer, it is very tasty and sweet, but thats not really what I want in an IPA. Hops...thats what I want. The mouthfeel is good. Light to medium and clean. A great beer to sit around drinking. Just not exactly what I would expect from something called ""hopdevil"".",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,edbeered,4.51,"Now that a local bar(The Happy Gnome)serves Victory Hop Devil on draft, I finally get a chance to review this quintessential American IPA. The color is a pleasing dark amber. The head disappears quickly, but there is ample lacing on the glass. The fact that I was in a smoke-filled bar probably accounts for the minimal smell of this beer. The taste on the other hand is instantly memorable. There is an intense hop burst up front, combined with a citrussy piney flavor, which is balanced by a notable malt undertone. THIS is what an IPA should taste like! The mouthfeel is rich, but refreshing. This is an amazing beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,ALESwhatCURESya,3.33,"Pours burnt orange with a semi-hazy body. The head never came on strong and was left to a thin film. Aroma was very resinous and filled with pine-like hoppiness. Not as full as I was hoping for. The taste came on very floral and finished with a rough hop bitterness. The hops are very concentrated in the center of the mouth and finish through decently. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied. The hops give way to a small amount of maltiness that comes through as it warms up. I have had much better and much worse IPAs. This is a great example of the style, but not world class to me. I feel as though there could be more complexity to this one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Well three months later its stilld great  A - A beautiful amber color with about a one inch off white head  S - A very sweet smell with no overwhelming hops  T - Taste is incredible sweet hops and maltiness that is amazing.  M - A smooth beer with a tad of carbonation at first.  D - I love this IPA, I could sit a drink a six pack while working around the house or cooking a batch of chili as I am right now. The hops are there but not overwhelmingly. I can't wait for my chili to be done to pair the two.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,EStreet20,4.47,"12 ounce bottle poured into a nonic pint glass.  A - A cloudy copper color with a nice one finger off white foam head.  S - Good grapefruity hop aroma on the nose. Not a hop bomb by any means but a nice aroma for an IPA.  T - A nice bold flavor on the first sip. A bit of a malty taste lingers behind a nice hop rush. A bit of a sweet breadiness there too with the hops leading the way. Some spiciness at the end.  M - No complaints here. A nice smooth feel in the mouth.  D - I've always loved this one. Def keeps you coming back for more.  Notes: This was my first IPA shortly before I discovered BA and it really got me going into the craft beer movement. Def a good one both for experienced IPA drinkers who dont want the complete hop assault of a DIPA, as well as those new to the style. Excellent work by Victory, as always.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,bahumutx,4.37,"Served from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Pours an orange/amber color with about a one finger head.  Smell: The first thing that assaults the nose is hops. There is a definite citrus smell. There is also a malt smell that is present.  Taste: The first taste, like the smell, is hops. The hops present a citrus flavor until the finish when there is a slight presence of malt. The hops defiantly over power any malt that is present. As the beer warms I am also picking out spiciness and a slight grassy taste.  Mouthfeel: Smooth Mouthfeel with a slight creamy feeling with a good amount of carbonation.  Drinkability: Very drinkable. I could have a few of these in a sitting.  This is my second beer from the Victory Brewing Company and I am very impressed. I think that this is a solid IPA and I will definitely enjoy it in the future.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,silver1audi,4.58,"I was so excited to finally see this beer on shelves near me. I have been keeping an eye out for it for quite a while and just randomly happened to notice it today. I can't get enough hops so a name like 'hopdevil' caught my attention the first time I heard about it. Upon cracking the bottle, I could immediatly smell what else, but hops. Hops and some citrus. It looked great in my glass; it poured a nice hazy amber color which is exactly how I like an IPA to look. First taste was great, a little malty taste for the first instant but then HOPS. A truly awesome beer, the type of IPA I have been looking for. I think I might have a few more after this one as I find it to be highly drinkable (although I can see how lesser fans of hops might not) but I think I'll save a few because they were pretty expensive at $8.69. A great beer. If you like hops and well balanced but complex IPA's, pick this up!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,BillyB,4.38,"I tried Victory's Hop Devil on cask at their brewpub in Downingtown, PA. Pours a nice hazy orange/copper. Nice foamy head, but not too big. Aroma is very citrussy, piney hops and a hint of sweet maltiness. Very complex taste. Excellent balance of hops and malt obviously leaning towards the hop side. The beer is very drinkable but you definitely have to be a hophead to handle more than a few.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,JasonCoop,4.95,"pours a somewhat hazy dark amber color with good white foam.  smells like sweet malts and big hops. seems great so far.  taste is quite balanced at first but falls into a heavy hop aftertaste. sweet malts upfront, a little bit fruity at first but then into a nice hop kick. alcohol is quite present. it's damn good.  mouthfeel probably couldn't be better. very pleasant. typical nice balanced IPA. not too heavy not too light. good balance like i said. a great brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Wasatch,4,"Revist: 2 Oct 15 Best By: 30 May 15  I've been sitting on this one for probably close to 2 months, but still it's past!  Pours a slightly dark amber color, with some nice carbonation, a nice small creamy off-white head, which does leave some nice sticky lacing behind. The nose is hoppy, malty, some citrus. The taste is still pretty good, hoppy, malty, some citrus. Medium body, with a nice dry/bitter finish. Overall, still a tasty brew, maybe not like a fresher one, but still, would take it over a fuckn' bud, coors, miller..... Will seek out a fresher one next time at the store.  Pours a golden/amber color, nice carbonation, small thin head, some nice lacing afterwards. Scents of hops, malt, citrus, and caramel. The taste is very hoppy with a little bit of a malt taste, has a very nice bite at the end. Medium body. This is a very nice IPA from Victory, do they make anything bad, lol. Very drinkable at the ABV, very hoppy, highly recommended.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,ahking,3.24,"Nice deep amber color, good clarity, decent head. Very spicy,pungent hop aroma emanates from my warming pint glass of Hop Devil. Obviously this is a highly hopped IPA. Malt flavors are light and the beer is quite dry. Hops dominate, very spicy and herbal. Mild pine flavors as well. Best part of this beer is the deep and complex hop aroma. However, this is nothing to write home about. Overall an average IPA that happens to be highly hopped. Victory is a great brewery and I think their pils is the best in the world. There is no way this beer should be rated higher than the pils. Anyone can make a decent and hoppy IPA. Definately worth a try for the complex hop aroma and flavor, but also try the pils.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,jaluria,4.15,"A mild copper color with a nice thick head that stays for quite a while. I detected aromas of hops, grass, citrus, and caramel; very appealing. The taste is suprisingly smooth and well balanced with a significant sugar flavor for this style. The alcohol is well concealed and hops seem to stay strong until the very last sip. The only thing I had a problem with was the aftertaste; a bit too bready and potent. An excellent beer with loads of character and flavor. Another great beer from Victory! Excellent drinkabilty",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,jp32,4.51,"Appearance is a nice thick copper color with an awesome tan-colored head created with a vigorous pour. This one smells delicious. I've spent so much time whiffing this one that I almost forgot I was supposed to drink it. An absolutely gorgeous smelling brew.  A nice bold citrus taste. Reminds me of grapefruit and oranges, maybe grapefruit peelings. Good smoothness considering the level of tart citrus hops. I also notice some sort of spices but cant figure out exactly what. Overall it tastes good. Hearty, and smooth for the style.  The mouthfeel is probably a little over medium-bodied, but not heavy. Quite a drinkable beer as well. I really wish I had more than just one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,SwillinBrew,3.88,"Well, tonight has been a Victory night as this is my second of their line for the evening.  A solid coppery honey with orange hues graces my pint glass with a finger of very light tan head. The bouquet was of citrus ending on toast bread. A bit sublte for me. I like a bit more punch.  A nice citrus grapefruit graces your tongue with some notes of grain and biscuit, possibly malt... a decent balance but leaning a bit more to the malts than i normally desire, but doesnt detradct from it. I liked this IPA and it's a good brew which i reccommend. Good body and carbonation.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,derrickt007,4.42,"Once again got this guy from Brawley's in Charlotte.  A. Pours a copper/ amber like color with an off white head that had good retention and some lacing.  S. Smells of hops, but not and over powering flowery smell like some IPA's.  M. To me its a meduim bodied beer.  T. Very good IPA, the taste of the hops were there, but the malt balances it out very well. ALmost a nutty taste in there. I am a hop head, but this was a very good tasteing beer that like i said balances out nice at the end.  O. Very drinkable, could knock back a couple of these in a session.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,SkeeterHawk,4.3,"Appearance: Pours a slightly cloudy orange bronze color with a half inch + of tan foam after a pretty aggressive pour. There are only a few bubbles rising, but the head sticks around for a while anyway. There is some lacing left behind after drinking.  Aroma: Lots of hops...go figure! There is a pronounced citrus with a dominant grapefruit presence. There is a good bit of floral hops in here too, and they remind me of Honeysuckle.  Taste: Amazingly there is enough malt in here to give the beer a palatable balance. There is quite a bit of floral and citrus hops noticeable in the beginning, but then there is assertive malt that makes its way into the profile. The finish is only slightly tipped toward the bitter, and doesn't leave you with a harsh metallic aftertaste that so many IPA's do.  Opinion: Well, I am not the biggest hophead, so I had ill conceived expectations of this beer. I was pleasantly surprised. There are a lot of hops here, but it is more for show than flavor. There is a whole lot of late additions, at the end of the boil...and just enough early in the boil to make this a very drinkable beer. I am not big on hops, but I would drink this beer again for sure!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,orfeu,4.35,"Hazy copper-amber with an offwhite head, decent attenuation. Adequate lacing all the way down the glass. Nose is bergamot spiciness, spruce, and orange pith. On the tongue its all peppery grapefruit rind and biscuity malt. Bitter pineyness. Some slight toffee in there, too. Really delicious. Nice, medium body and overall juicy (thickish) mouthfeel. Excellent IPA. Id drink it regularly if I could.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

It had a very assertive floral and citrus hops aroma, with some light malts and fresh bread.  The taste was of dominated by citrusy hops, and hints of sweet bread malts. The mouthfeel was smooth, nicely carbonated, and medium bodied.  Overall, this is a very drinkable brew. The alcohol is well hidden underneath the hoppyness. A very good IPA for a guy that typically does not like them.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,johnshuster,4.25,"S-Bottle from a six pack that I picked up at the local store. Victory is big in PA where I was in school, but living in MA now I was surpised but happy to see their stuff in the cooler. Then I got home and saw the enjoy by July 2005 stamp on the side of the bottle...this was November 10th...oh well, I gave it a try anyway. It was still pretty good.  A-The usual IPA, reddish brown slightly golden color. A nice light head on top that left behind plenty of lacing on the way down.  S-Not as overpowering as IPAs usually are. Mind you, that is a smell I like so overpowering is not used in any negative sense here...but anyway, this didn't have the trademark super hoppy scent that I have come to expect from most IPAs. It was still there, just more subdued and subtle in its hoppiness.  Taste-Since I couldn't compare this to a fresh beer, I don't know whether this was tasting right or not. But, it was not bad at all. This was not as hoppy as other beers of this kind I have had, but that's not a bad thing since I think sometimes it gets overdone. Some hopiness was still there and the beer is filled with strong flavors throughout.  Mouthfeel-Pretty good. Again, who knows what the age did to it here. It was not very carbonated...only a slight bit present. Nothing to complain about though, nice and smooth with a little bite to it.  D-Just fine. Can't really taste the high octane in this one at all. Goes down smooth, even if it is 4 months too old! Very good balanced flavor, not so assaulting you can keep drinking it. Would try again for sure, hopefully a fresh one next time.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Zorro,4.53,"Pours a slightly hazy red colored ale with a fair tan head. I could almost call this amber but it is more red than that.  Smell is LOTS of citrus hops with a fairly strong sour note from them. Little bit of bready malt scent is there but the hop scent simply dominates this beer. Little bit of oak scent in this.  Taste is very mildly sweet with a slight sour note and lots of hops. First sensation I get here is smoke, and it is very pleasant. The smokiness reminds me of a good Scottish wee heavy. Strong oak and grapefruit are the next hop flavors to make themselves known. Fairly bitter without getting harsh this is a great IPA that pulls off that trick very well. Strong hop oil slickness on the teeth and tongue.  Mouthfeel is good rich without going to far.  Super drinkable for a very strong IPA. This an excellent beer with only one fault, the 6.7% ABV makes this a bit strong for drinking one after another. Great beer that I can recommend.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,wedge,4.35,"New bottle 2008: The bitterness seems to be just right. Rich, oily, and flavorful...a nice bit of malt, but hoppy as hell. An excellent IPA that I ignore far too often. GET IT FRESH.  Pours a hazy orange-copper with a fat two-finger off-white head. Smell is deliciously hoppy, floral - lightly sweet malts, and even some toasted grain. Taste is a solid wall of hops with a strong malt backbone - medium bitterness. Smooth mouthfeel with minimal carbonation and a slightly bitter finish.  Less in-your-face than I remember...still very aromatic and palatable. Doesn't punish your tastebuds with bitterness, instead it charms them with a great savory hoppy flavor. Very distinct...good stuff.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Beautful carbonation. Thick lacing like a MoFo!  Huge malty aroma. The big malt smell overpowers the hops. Smells like fresh boiled wort to me.  Thick on the palate, rich malt flavor. A fruity raisin like flavor and hints of tea in there. Very mild bitternes that sticks to the back of the tongue with a hint of grapefruit.  Very good, full bodied, nice balance and very drinkable.  Cheers!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,Enola,4.34,"This beer is the color of a Red Oak leaf in October. It has a smell that is one of the best of any beers I've had. There is no question this bad boy is bitter. The hops have started Armageddon on my tongue. WOW!! This is my first beer from Victory and if this is any indication I can't wait to see what they can do for a stout. ( SKS ) Could I drink more than one. Oh yeah. Will I tonight? Nope, I'm out. 6% Cap went to Hell via Hop Devil!!!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,burnstar,4.78,"Three pints from cask at Zeno's. Wow. The cask really does wonders to this stuff. There is a glorious thick off-white head that persists forever. Below the everlasting head, this beer is a fantastic opaque dark amber color. Smell is all hops- spicy and citrusy and pretty much the same as the stuff from a bottle. Tastes fantastic. Hops hit hard and persist throughout. The difference is that it just tastes a bit more complex and untamed than normal hopdevil. I must say that what really stikes me about this beer more than anything else is the mouthfeel- heavy and creamy and just fantastic. Perhaps the best mouthfeel of any beer I've tried. Pretty drinkable- addictive really, as the fact that I had three pints demonstrates. Wonderful stuff.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,dfuller,3.95,"Appearance: A nice IPA light brown with a thin head and little lacing to speak of.  Smell: A bit cleaner than you'd expect for an IPA of this strength. A few notes of roasted nuts come through.  Taste: Hop heavy, as the name obviously implies. This is an unpretentous beer, so I can forgive it for its complete lack of balance. This is supposed to be a hop-hitter and it certainly lives up to that. Sweeter and less bitter than your typical hophead feature, but that's about all there is to add.  Mouthfeel: The sharp bitterness of the hops dominates as you'd expect. Still, light in body for an IPA.  Drinkability: Surprisingly drinkable on a hot day. This beer would hold up well against some spicy food and sweating-hot weather.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Backer2004,4.3,"I will be writing nothing that has not been written about HopDevil Ale since over 600 reviews have already been written about it (which looks like it's the second more reviewed ever). For only 6.7% ABV, this one packs a mighty punch which I truly enjoyed over a big ND win versus Tennessee yesterday. Paid only $7.50 a six pack, which was the first time I've seen it in our post-Pop the Cap grocery store. This one is not for everyone; I would not have enjoyed this one bit two years ago. Much better than the Redhook IPA I had a bit later that evening.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,beerluvr,4.47,Came to the table with a minimal soapy head over clear deep amber liquid. Nose is all biscuity malt and flowery hops.

It pours a dark hazy copper color with a nice rocky retentive head. It smells of fregrant hops and some hints of spice. The taste is the best as its tastes overly hoppy. Very bold and tasty hops with enough malt to make it go down smooth. I noticed fragrant, earthy, herbal hops. I loved this beer and have since ordered many more pints.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,blackie,4.03,"appearance: Best by date of January 6, 2006 is indicated on the bottle. The head is off white and quickly dissipates, leving a thin layer of carbonation behind. The beer is a medium to dark amber, and looks wonderful.  smell: Smells nice and hoppy, but not overdone. The hops smell green, fresh, and have some tropical citrus notes as well as some pineapple. The smell seems pretty well balanced, though I have a hard time pinning down the malt aromas, though I can sense their dark sweetness. There is a slight woodiness and a nuttiness to the malt aroma.  mouthfeel: Carbonation is on the lower end of high and the body is medium light.  taste: Mmmmm hops and malt. The hops are fresh and spicy with blenty of bittering ability, and the malt provides a nice balance with its lightly sweet flavors. There is also a somewhat nutty, maybe pecan like characteristic to this IPA that I don't usually expect from this style, but I like it. The hops provide a green bitterness lasting long into the finish.  drinkability: very drinkable for an IPA",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Hagbard,4.2,"Hazy orange-copper in appearance with a thick, rocky, off-white head. The head has some serious peaks and valleys before gradually dissipating. It leaves some very dense lacing on the sides of the glass. The aroma is very hoppy. Citrus fruits dominate, including orange and grapefruit. There seems to be a very nice malt presence backing everything up. The taste is very nice. Citrus juiciness, oranges and grapefruits. A beautiful malt base appears in the middle and softens everything. It finishes with a gentle hop bitternesss. This is a truly great tasting IPA. There is a ton of hoppiness in it, yet it never falls into the common IPA trap of becoming too harsh. I guess the malt base is sturdy enough to support the hoppiness while keeping it gentle. Very drinkable. I would love the chance to try this on cask, it seems tailor made for it. Also of note is the freshness date on the bottle keeping you from buying old stock. So simple, but such a useful tool.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

At first a very nice and strong hoppy,bitter, grapefruit aroma. The taste in the beginning is not overly hoppy or bitter because of the pleasing balance with the malt however you get a nice hop punch in the aftertaste. A medium bodied mouthfeel that's very crisp and leaves the taste in your mouth for a while.

When it hit my tongue there was a definite hop bitterness, but the malt did a good job of keeping it balanced. It felt rather nice in the mouth too. It started to go down fairly easily, but towards the end of the swallow the fairly harsh hop bitterness showed up, and it left a fairly harsh aftertaste. The harsh bitterness on the back of my tongue remained for the entire time I was drinking the beer, but it became a bit more subdued as my tastebuds acclimated to it.  I wouldn't drink more than one or two of these in a session, especially if a smoother IPA was available. Definitely a good beer, but not amazingly drinkable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,tempest,4.18,"Picked up a 6'er while a pizza cooked in the oven and man was this a treat.  Beautiful golden body with a 2"" head that left a lot of lacing and retained some head all the way down.  Hops and spice in the aroma, could be a little stronger  Like the smell, a spicey hops bitterness that really hits the spot. I was hoping for a little more kick in the flavor, but it this is a well rounded, long lasting taste. MMMmmm.  Really pleasant in your mouth. It's got a little body to it and the carbonation is really on.  6.7%? You're kidding me. A nicely balanced drink that goes easy and tastes great. Consider for a hophead session.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,numenor1,4.1,"Pours a deep amber with a decent beige head that reduces to a sturdy collar, laces well. Smells of citrus and caramel malts. First there's a light burst of citrus hops then the caramel maltiness makes itself known, while the hops kick back in for citrus and pithy bitterness(though the malty sweetness continues to last) into the finish. There's also a strong earthy hop character thrown in for good measure. Fairly well balanced as the malts make a strong showing, and the bitterness never overwhelms. It's good, but i prefer some other IPA's as far as flavor goes. This boasts a good medium body with medium carbonation. Very drinkable, but not my favorite.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,miollnir,3.55,"Poured into a standard American pint glass. Medium sized head to it. A deep amber color. A bitter piney scent under woody cherry tones. Tastes oak, a sharp bitter taste, hoppy taste, but not as hoppy in scent.  Has the standard IPA feel to it, typical of (if one so calls it) an America IPA. Bitter with lots of hop appeal. Yet the hoppiness only comes through on the drink, the scent (which I feel is most important in an IPA) is not as prevalent on other beers such as Brooklyn or Blue Points Hopnotical (which is great BTW).  Too bitter on the mouth, which decreases the enjoyment of the actual drink. Has a crunchieness to it, with what seems like a very cherry flavored and lemon twist?  Overall a very confusing beer, yet has its upside as good hoppy tasteing beer, but not something I would want to go out of my way to drink often.  Victory's Prima Pils is another story!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,texashammer,4.6,"Deep amber color, slightly hazy, with thick rocky off-white head, 2 fingers. Oily and exuberant flowery hops in the nose, along with some malt struggling against the big hops. Tastes immediatly bitter, with aggressive and oily, juicy hops, mostly flowery. Some sweetness as you drink on into it. Dry finish. Full body, smooth and slick mouthfeel, with a bite from the hops in the middle. Drinkable? Oh, yes. Gulpable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,nickss,4.41,"One of the most beautiful looking beers I have ever seen. Deep orange in hue, with a MONSTER of a head... 1/2"" of gorgeous fluffy-as-a-cloud foam that refuses to disipate. As I drink it, huge globs of lace cling to the sides of my glass.  Smells of hops.... lots and lots of fresh hops. There is some grassy smell in there as well.  Well... the name doesnt lie, nor does the smell. This beer is hoppy! It has a bit of spicy kick too it too, but IMO that only adds to the uniqueness, and utter wonderfulness of this brew. MMM!  The mouthfeel is extremely active, as the hops hit the tongue and dance around. However, it is also surprisingly thick feeling. Very very nice.  I could drink a lot of this beer, and did so last summer. Another brilliant brew from Victory... these guys can simply do no wrong.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,ClearDog,4.2,"I just purchased two six-packs from New World Wine Co. in Milwaukee which is from what I'm told, the first store in Wisconsin to offer Victory Brewing Co. brands.  Appearance -- Pours into my imperial pint glass a light orange amber color. Nice two finger head; quickly shrinks down to a one finger creamy white head. Carbonation is visible.  Smell -- Hops. Can just make out whiffs of grapefruit. It gets better as it warms. Pleasant and very enjoyable. In a way as the beer gets warmer it smells somewhat sweeter.  Taste -- Bitter hops. Hop Devil tastes just a little different than a lot of IPA's I've tried. The first couple of sips remind me of smoke. As the beer warms you get alcohol, but nothing overwhelming, as well as a grapefruit like finish.  Mouthfeel -- Medium to light. Creamy. You can feel the carbonation on the sides of your tongue.  Drinkability -- Very nice drinkability. I could probably get myself into a little trouble with this one. Easily one of the better IPA out there. Overall a very enjoyable IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Oxymoron,4.27,"I've had this beer multiple times but never rated, or until now. Sampled from a 12oz bottle, HopDevil pours a dark orange color with brown tinge, but brightens significantly when held to the light. The beer is for the most part clear. Also good head retention and lacing, but both dissipates over time.  The smell has strong hop aroma. Strong floral aroma with a zesty citrus, a little bit of piney and noticeable spiciness. Some slightly sweet malt is noticeable but hops are strong. Overall this is a stronger smell that is very prominent even for an IPA.  The taste is strong hops but not oily like some high hop beers are. A big floral flavor that is complex. A start from a citrus savor but a stronger grapefruit and lemony flavor just overflows the taste buds. A basic somewhat sweet malt is in the background but plays second fiddle to the hops.  A medium body with limited carbonation, HopDevil is a great tasting IPA. Nothing new here. So go out and try one for yourself.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Melchizedek,3.93,"Pours a hazy sort of rust-orange. Head builds up nicely to about an inch and subsides to a lasting cap that leaves traces down the glass.  It smells hoppy--not a whole lot else to say; the aromas are a little floral and strongly citrusy. In the mouth it makes good on its promise, hops all over the place, although not so aggressive as to be off-putting. Citric and floral notes are joined by a grassy undertone, while the alcohol comes through with warmth and a bit of spiciness. There's some bready yeast as well; as the beer warms, the bitterness takes on sort of a tea-like flavor, with an aftertaste that might be a bit too lingeringly bitter for my taste. The mouthfeel is great, very chewy and with a nice body.  This has sort of a quintessential (to my mind) IPA flavor, strongly hoppy and interesting. I'd definitely have another, and I wish I could have had one with lunch today (some great Indian food).",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,RedwoodGeorge,3.48,"The beer pours an interesting light mahogany - somewhere between deep orange and light brown. Moderate sized dirty white head that recedes quickly leaveing no lacing at all.  The nose is surprisingly subdued with a few floral and herbal hop notes and a nice bready grain scent.  Taste is equally subdued, well developed dry malt tastes similar to saltines and some interesting (light) amber-like fruit notes of peach and apricot. Hop presence is surisingly not present. Some bittering but not gobs and very little in the way of aromatics. Slight piney notes and quite a few light herbal flavors but that's about all. Primary flavors seem to be noble hops - the is quite reminiscent of a British ESB.  Mouthfeel is fine - it's a medium bodied brew with reasonable carbonation. Slight hop finish drys out the drink and leaves a clean palate, no oily residue on the tongue.  Overall I'd give this an ""ehhh"" It's an okay brew with some very nice malt flavors but for something called ""HopDevil"" it's surprisingly light on the hops. I would like to try this one again sometime to see if my tastebuds were off that day or if this HopDevil really is just a HopRascal  Thanks to mntlover for sending this bottle Westward in a very generous trade!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,DrunkMcDermott,3.46,"Good hop nose in the glass. Pours a nice Sierra nevade brown under an off-white head. In actual taste, though, hops are not as smacky as one would believe. instead, they start out understated, a nice peppery and grassy start.

Color and body are great. Glowing orange, medium head retention but great lacing. Cloudy translucency indicating unfiltered, a potential gut bomb. Needless to say this beer is very hoppy, followed by a little too much bitterness IMO, but nonetheless a good tasting beer; mainly characterized by a peachy infused body.

The malt fights through the hoppy and peaks through adding complexity to the aroma. The taste gives the illusion of being balanced during the sip. The aftertaste, however, show this brew's true nature. Nice and hoppy. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, a little lighter than other IPAs I've had. Not that that is bad.

Just a touch of hop bitterness in the finish that makes you yearn for another sip.  M: Medium-bodied, medium carbonation, and lots of stickiness. You experience this beer long after you have swallowed. Excellent.  D: I don't think I've had a better IPA. Lots of hop presence, but without the bite of some - just smooth.

Taste is fairly balanced with the malt up front which arrives quite smoothly on the palate, followed by a nice dose of juicy grapefruit hops. The hops are not overly oily, but they do coat nicely and end leaving some bitterness behind. The finish also has taste which I can only describe as sweetly acidic, like an apple with the skin still on it. Overall a very drinkable IPA with a very pleasing hop profile.

Aroma of spicy floral hops, roasted malt, and a touch of black pepper. Palate is well-balanced between a nice roasted malt character and a big hop presence. Finish is dry with a nice hop bitterness.

I'm getting more toasty and bready sweet malt than usual with this style, hops don't come out in your face in the aroma. A piney character is definitely there though, with a little citrus.  Oh, so here's where the hops were hiding. Initially, nutty sweetness with a rim of bitterness, leading into a well-hopped middle. Tangy and boisterously leafy. Lovely malt profile in the background, nutty sweet all the way through with a touch of bread and butter. Big rind-like hoppy finish. Nice bitter leaf extract aftertaste that I love.  Creamy and smooth mouthfeel with rough edges, as it should be. Very well-balanced.  Perhaps a bit more tame than its west-coast counterparts, but certainly a wonderful beer nonetheless.

Light amber malt, more gentle bitterness arises as you work your way through the glass. A nice spicy blend, some cinnamon and Red Hots elements hidden among the hops.  Mouthfeel is light and clean, finishes well without turning too bitter. Lies somewhere between a pale ale and a DFH 60 Minute. Bottle is a lot cleaner than the tap serving.

I was afraid it might have been the way the beer actually tasted, that I might not be cultured enough to appreciate such a high-rated beer, which is why this little number has been sitting on my shelf for two weeks, waiting to be drank.  Pours nice. Very dark, even for an APA. Red and so hazy I can see outlines through it--tracers of light without form or function.  Smells like hops and caramel. I know that's a bit of a generic description, but WOW. This smells like fresh, candy-apple caramel and the nicest hop leaves you can kind, mixed together in almost perfect harmony against a backdrop of wonderful bread yeast.   The taste is the nose, only not quite as intense and hoppy. Raw dough yeast upfront, moving into fruity hops, ending on caramel. Not very bitter, actually, but tasty as all hell.

Smell of sweet hoppiness, not very powerful.  Almost no malt profile cam through, and the hop was very light and just slightly bitter.  Light body with light carbonation.

Smell is sweet caramel, a bit biscuity, and not nearly as much hops as I would have thought, but sure enough there is definitely some aroma in there. Taste is pretty much the opposite of the smell, Loads of hop flavor with just a backing of caramely sweetness and biscuity goodness. Mouthfeel is good, my sample is a bit warmer than I would have liked (left the bottle warm on the counter too long tonight), but still damn drinkable.

Normally I'm not a huge hop fiend, but after drinking Stone brews for a while, it's something I crave! Let me start with ""this beer is GREAT!"" It pours a wonderful red color...almost like an amber ale, but slightly lighter. Defintely a little more red than a typical IPA. The smell is really sweet, but with charactaristic hop floral overtones. The hops are certainly there but not overpowering. Taste is actually much like the smell. It's actually a much sweeter than what I was expecting. Lots of cherry and currant flavors mixing, but with a nice bitter hop finish. At 6.7% it's potent and I'm not sure I could ever session these, but I could certainly have 2-3 with no issues.

The aroma is fairly non-distinct...softly floral like many hoppy beers, and a bit of malt is sneaking in there but it's still fairly so-so.  The mouth starts of sweetly malty and then transitions smoothly into the hops which assert themselves strongly on the back of the tongue like a piney citrus twang. The hops were quite strong, but not to the point of being unenjoyable, largely because there was at least some attempt to keep the beer balanced. The after-taste lingers with the hops just refusing to let go of my tongue.  Mouth is fairly light, but that should be expected with this style of beer. Drinkability, a shade above average but nothing remarkable.

345,1005,ChappyCubsFan,4.5,"One of the best IPA's in the country. I've had it in bottles all these years but somehow have never rated it. I'm glad I finally got to sample it on tap last month at the Victory Brewery in Downingtown, PA. It's copper in color, and in terms of IPA's, it has one of the best and unique blends of malt and hops that bite with an oustanding hoppy bitterness and sweet malt taste. It's nearly perfect in every respect. It won our blind taste test in 2002 of mostly New England IPA's. It's got great lacing on the pour. What more is there to say?",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Sayson,4.5,What can I say about this beer that hasn't already been said? Damn little. This beer is an intense assault of hoppy goodness that just won't quit. The taste starts starts quietly and then explodes across the sides of the tongue with a tidal wave of bitterness. The aftertaste keeps going and going. Great mouthfeel very full.  What a great beer!,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Dubblebock,4.13,"HopDevil was my introduction to the Victory Brewing Company, and I'd like to take the opportunity to thank them for entering the Texas market. I've been reading about their beers for quite a while here on BA, and I've always wanted to give them a try. This was definitely a case of the reality living up to the anticipation. HopDevil comes with a beautifully crafted label, the smiling HopDevil fashioned out of hop leaves beckoning forth and tempting the drinker. Nice touch. The beer ain't bad, either.  HopDevil poured with a more than adequate head of froth, and a deep amber coloring. The nose was all hops, clean and refreshing.  The taste was also full of hops, but not overwhelmingly so. This wasn't an outright hop bomb along the lines of SNCA. No, this was more like a Stone IPA, although not quite as balanced. The hops take the forefront of the flavor, but the beer did have a well-developed malt backbone to keep things from getting out of hand. Incredibly clean and fresh taste. Nice citrus notes, almost a fruity complexion behind the hoppiness. Beautifully done, and very interesting.  The mouthfeel was great, the carbonation was excellent. The drinkability was high, as this is a perfect summertime quaffer. I'll pick the HopDevil out of a crowd again the next time that I'm looking for a good summer beer with some bite.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,mushroomcloud,4.27,"WOW!!! This was my first Victory beer since it came to town a couple of months ago.  Hop Devil is a deep orange-amber with some brighter highlights towards the bottom of the glass. A 1/4"" off-white head with tight carbonation falls quickly to a cap. Light lacing.  Aromas of pine, fresh citrus and overall tangy hops are at the forefront. There is a good malty undertone balancing out the smell of this IPA.  This beer is bursting with flavor!! Tangy orange, lime, even cherry!?!?!?Nice caramel malt backbone leaves this beer alnost perfectly balanced. Good medium hop bite in the end.  Extremely well balanced IPA form Victory. Full-bodied with medium carbonation and a long finish. Very well made and leaves me looking forward to the next bottle, and the next, and...",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,soper2000,4.22,"I couldn't pass this one over anymore. Until today it seemed a perpetual second choice, always backing up but never purchased. It pours a beautiful orange tinged ruby red but is lacking any significant head, only a slightly off-white wispy foam covering. Aroma is a citrusy hop blast but with more of a caramel malt backing than some more aggressive ipa's like Alpha King. Taste belies the aggressive hop aroma, I find that this is a very well balanced IPA with enough caramel flavors to offset the massive amount of hops. The mellow citrus/pine flavors finish with just a hint of spiciness. Mouthfeel is a little thin for a beer of almost 7 percent, but all around this is an excellent IPA which won't peal the enamel off of your teeth.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,alexgash,4.72,"Copper kettle body with a bright, clear sheen. Thick, substantial, dirty sand head. Nose is huge caramel cookie dough malts. A little toffee in there too, and some charred brown sugar. Bracing hop profile is sappy, resinous, bitter, and mesmerizing. Rich toffee malts are sweet and delicious. Hops come on strong: resinous and bitter. Good balance. Finish dries out with faded cookie malt. My tongue is hop-numbed. Medium to full body, with a creamy feel up front that moves to almost oily. An amazing classic that has yet to disappoint me (even old bottles!).",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Dukeofearl,4.3,"Pours a moderately dark orange-copper, darker than most (but not all) of the IPAs I've tried. Clear, with a pretty, solid off-white head.  Aroma is clean hops, flowery, slightly smoky?/charcoal? gentle malts. A slight sweetness hides behind the hops.  Flavor comes across as a solid, hoppy, IPA, well balanced with gentle malts underlying very flavorful, but not overly bitter hops. Well, ok, the hops are a little bitter in the finish, but they are very solid up until that point.  A solid IPA that I enjoy on this, its first trip to the West Coast since I became more aware of good beer. I may enjoy its California brethren a little more, but that probably says more about me than about this beer. Quite good.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

The nose is grapefruit and floral hops with a bit of honey. Mouthfeel is medium-light. Tastes just crisp enough, lots of grapefruit and tons of hop aftertaste, although not as much as you'd expect from the name. Very dry and refreshing. An excellent well priced IPA with a very big taste and presence. Definitely a must try and a great session beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Xadoor,4.8,"Victory Brewing beers are new to the Texas market and I was quite excited to try them after all the great things I've heard about the beer. Pours a dark amber with a foamy head that dissipates relatively quickly, but retains a thin white layer down to the bottom of the glass.

345,1005,Beervis,4.55,"Pours from the 12oz a deep, clear amber with a thick tan head.  Smell is flowery hops, grapefruit, and a light malty sweetness.  Taste, where do I begin. This beer has it all, nice thick malt, bitter hops, and the most amazing spicy character. The bitter hops spiciness smacks you on the palate and doesn't let up. I've never really tasted hop flavours quite like this. The body is complex and smooth, but at the same time, perfectly unbalanced. The hops are in command. A slight bit of sweetness quickly fades and gives way to an ending bitterness and still a residual spiciness and alcohol warmth.  This beer rocks. I love IPA's, and this one is no exception. With the killer hop bite, warming alcohol, and that amazing spicy kick, this one is a new favourite!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Ricochet,4.05,"A: A very dark amber, good head, just as expected.  S: As advertised. Hops. Hops. Hops. Pale ale x2.  M: Citrus start, hop bitterness, warm in the mouth. It wasn't dry like I've known IPAs to be.  T: Nothing can be said by me that wasn't said by many others. This was a full pale with overpowering hops flavor than took center stage and hammed it up like Shatner. Great.  D: Very. However, something I've noted as of late... I always considered myself a hophead, but I like a little more ""suttle"" hoppy beer taste rather than them ""stick it in your face"" hoppiness of this and other stong hops beers. I prefer a flavor not so drastic, therefore , my drinkability score is lessened but still, this is one of those special beers if you're looking for the extreme.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Poured a nice, amber color, with an off-white head, about one finger's worth; head dissipated slowly, but still showed a partial head even to the last sip. Left a nice lacing throughout. Hoppy taste, very easy to drink. One of the best beers I've had in a long time.  Price was $8.99 for a sixer, which I thought was high, but for the quality of this beer, it was well worth the price.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Some light pine hints underneath the above mixture.  Taste is lots of hops fruity and floral flavors mixed in the caramel malt. This beer is hoppy but has a good sized malt body to carry the hops on. Bitterness is grapefruity in nature mixed with a touch of apricot. Finish is a mixture of the above grapefruit and some pine resin hints.

Hop Devil bottle gently flows into my crystalline pint glass. Ah-men! No ONE beer is my favorite, but THIS is ONE of my favorites. Yummy. A nearly perfect two finger frothy, sticky head salutes the pour, which, alone, stands up to legendary status among men. Damn the torpedoes and the 300+ BA reviews, for another can only do her justice. This baby is all golden ruby amber hue of perfection. Champagne bubbles roll on and up. Olfactory senses beware: Aromatic, heavenly hops tickle before the beer hits the tongue. Sweet, heavy beauteous hop aroma drips from my nostrils with each waft, like the smell of pancakes, butter and syrup on a hung over Sunday morning. Mmmm.  Taste? Ambrosia, yes, as in 7th grade Latin class: Food for the gods. Honey suckle hops as golden in flavor as the brassy hue. Solid flavor through the cool to warmed temps. This girl can go the distance. Yum. Do I like hops? Taste and appearance of 5's for the first time in my reviews.  If I drink more than three, the thick sweetness clings. Malts? We don't need no stinking malts! Can't drink up these all night or I'd be tunafied! Too tasty? Hmm. Maybe. Like a Philly Tastey-cake too tasty. Could you eat Krimpets all night? Well then. Thought not.

Smell is mostly, you guessed it, hops. A bit of citrus/pine as well. Nice fresh smell.  Strong hop flavor, but I don't think as much as the Stone IPA. Very refreshing drink, and the alcohol is just noticeable. Taste jumps from a bit citrus to great hop bitterness. Finishes a bit dry, and then leaves that nice hop bitterness behind. Freakin' Hop Devil.  Overall a great beer. I wish I had regular access to this one.

The nice frothy one finger white head soon lays out to a thin film and leaves lots of nice lacing. Smell is of a mild mix of citrus and pine hops backed with some sugary malt. Taste is of creamy malt and lots of infused hops including a sugary grapefruit and a nice array of maltiness that balances this brew. Mouthfeel is super smooth and creamy and runs over the palate nicely. Mild cask carbonation makes this seem like a completely different Hop Devil but in a good way. Drinkability is superb as the cask seems to mellow out some of the bite of the hops and the sting isn't noticible. Sticky, resinous hops stay on the lips making me want more of this treat.  Finger licking good.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Smells of grapefruit pith with gentle undertones of apricot. Tastes woonderful. Sweet and grapefruit citrusy with moticable fruit esters. Apricot, gentle peach, piney sour tang, and honey. The beer is dry and has a cinnamon quality about it, as well as some tannin. The ending is caramelly sweet sugary with a citrus aftertaste. A nice easy drinking beer that's really tasty.

345,1005,jakester,4.45,"12 oz. bottle. I was drinking this while rating it.  Pours a fairly clear, deep reddish/orange with a big, foamy, cream colored head. The head drops to @ 1/8"" and remains throughout the beer. Lacing on the glass for every sip. If you look closely, you can see tiny little floaty things in there. Medium carbonation evident.  Smells of toffee/caramel, along with pronounced grapefruit. Hop aroma dissipates slowly, to be overtaken by the malt. As the beer warms, you can smell the alcohol in the back.  This beer has a huge malt base, which balances the impressive bittering level. Malt sweetness is the very first flavor, followed by the blitzkrieg of bittering, followed by the grapefruit. Heat from the alcohol is ever present. The hops in this beer are right on for style. This is NOT a DIPA. Belching up grapefruits. (Not sure if they're pink or yellow).  A luxurious, decadent richness of sensations fills the mouth from first sip to last. Bitter bite, soft carbonation, and rich textures of malt sweetness all linger together, fighting to decide which will be the first to leave. Lips stick together from malt sweetness.  This is my everyday drinking beer. I have two cases of this in my beer fridge at all times. For me to not give it a 5 for drinkability would be criminal.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,TinusTime,4.1,"Pours a clear amber with some darker highlights. Nice soft off white head was substantial at first but faded into just a film.  Smell quite nice and rich with hoppy goodness. Some citrusy grapefruity notes, spice, and a touch of pine all intermingle. There is a touch of sweetness that can be found through all of the hop attack.  Taste is surprisingly not too over hopped. Nice sweet bready malts provide a backbone for the hop assault. Finishes dry with more pine and citrus toward the back.  Mouthfeel is good. Not to heavy and nice carbonation keeps the palate sharp. Drinkability is very good. They go down so easy that quick palate fatique is not an issue. Overall a very good IPA, not the best in my book, but one that I will definitly come back to again and again",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Smell is a little weak overall but good nonetheless. I pick up some floral and pine hop aromas over a nice sweet bread-like malt base. This one presents itself with an initial spiciness on the tongue and back of the mouth with pine overtones which transitions over to a very bitter resin finish which lingers for a long while. A very balanced beer as it is hoppy enough to seem bitter while still containing some maltyness in the background. Mouthfeel is as good as they come with an IPA, full and coats the palate well. I think this is one of the more full bodied IPAs Ive had. Drinkability is very good as well due to the nicely crafted balanced.

Citrus accents with the usual pine. This one has a backbone though!  The bitterness is very upfront and to the point on the first sip. After an initial ""wow"", grapefruit and a total spicey pine flavor. It can be a bit harsh on the palette, but it is well balanced by a noticable malt profile.  A really tasty, kick you in the face, upfront, somewhat harsh, still smooth IPA. If I had regular access I would probably pick up a bunch for a session. I will sleep very well tonight.

345,1005,Dithyramb,4.35,"12 oz. brown bottle purchased at Avalon Liquors in SNJ. Best before Sept. 16, 2005 clearly notable on the front label. Pours amber, just a bit darker brown accented than most. A few arcs of carbonation off the side. A shorter lived, but full and frothy, dark tan head reduced to a nice lace. Hearty citrus and pine aroma Initial biting bitterness that had a blend of citrus and pine notes. This isn't a one trick pony, though. A superb malty bakebone kept everything in check. Slightly more than medium mouthfeel. Didn't finish as dry or astringent as one would expect. Drinkable? Sometimes, we're worried that we pack too much beer. That they will take up the ice. After fishing, we won't have any room to put the day's catch in, since we have all these full bottles to lug back to the house. Not the case here. The sixer disappeared. Yes, I'd have several.

A white fluffy head formed initially which soon receded to a thin white cap. Each sip produced a web of lacing along the glass.  The beer had a light aroma of grapefruit, but little else.  The taste was quite good. Grapefruit and sweet wheat bread dominated. Simple and satisfying.  The mouthfeel for this brew seemed perfect for the style: medium body with a moderate level of carbonation.  The drinkability was quite good--it was refreshing and crisp; though I feel that the relatively high ABV, though not noticable in the taste, limits the sessionability of this fine ale.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Smell: Well, it's hoppy (Duh). Real earthy, cheesy hop aroma (maybe because I'm eating some sharp chedder). Not real strong, though. I like a little more intesity in IPAs  Taste: Very nice hop profile. Bitter, but not too intense. There's a slight metallic taste, that's really the only drawback. It seems to come and go, though. Again, some nice earthy flavors, a little yeasty and sweet too.  Drinkability: great. good session IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Smell comes on fruity with that characteristic hoppy arome of grapefruit and cheese? ;D Nice fruity smell filled with all kinds of flavours.  Comes on quite carbonated with oranges and apples. Theres grapefruit here as well that gives the beer a somewhat dry character. Hops are strong, aswell as the malts. Carbonation lifts the hops and this is a firm, yet light and pleasant beer that finishes with a strong bitterness.  IPA's are good, this one too. Doesn't make the top for me though.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Citadel82,4,"I enjoyed this brew despite its being so dog-gone hoppy. If you are a hop lover this is a brew for you. There are enough malt notes to make it intersing but this copper colored beauty is the real hop deal. It has a short lived white head that leaves plenty of lacing on the glass, it has a citrus and biscuit aroma and a ctrus pith and biscuit taste. Dry as the desert an mutli-layered from the first grapefruit and orange rind sip to the biscuit and carmel that fleetingly appears before a long dry citrus finish.

Smell-had a very pleasant hoppy aroma with a slight hint of Alcohol. Indiviual aromas were hard to pick out of the complexity of the overall aroma.  Taste-I'm not a hop head but the good malt backbone really helped tame the overall hoppiness. The hops produced a slight grapefruit puckering effect.  Mouthfeel-Had a pleasing light to medium body that was good on the touge. The hop bite was very evident with a small alcohol pepperness to it.  Drinkability-I would definately buy again, however because of the hoppiness I would limit it to 1 to 2 a nite, but I'm not a hop head, yet.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Pours a deep copper color with a creamy head poured off to about 1/2 "" that that disappeared everywhere but to the edges & stuck to the pint glass the whole way down. Aroma is hoppy (duh!) with a surprising amount of malt. Taste is a wallop of piney, grapefruity hops in the beginning that totally gives way to malt in the middle, then reappears again on the swallow. Smooth, medium mouthfeel. The taste of hops will coat your tongue long after the last sip is gone. Overall: FANTASTIC!!! I'm not a hop-head, but I love this beer.

345,1005,cooter,3.78,"Pours with aggressive, medium-large bubbled carbonation and a 1.5 finger cloudlike head. Body is a clear orange-red with more muted bubbling.  Nose is intense. Hoppy from a distance, it has strong pine, soft citrus (more biting like a grapefruit than sour like a lemon). When swirled it gives off Czech Pils herbal hop scent. Clean scent, good lacing as the head dies.  The head provides a well-balanced mouthfeel, combining bite with smoothness. Hops obviously dominate, with notes of orange, black pepper, phenols. An abrupt finish, but it comes back after a pause with a head-shake-inducing hop kick. A little fruity, with maybe melon, blackberry, or strawberry. Some butter flavor. Bitters and herbs. I'm having trouble discerning individual flavors in the general hop blast.  Not an overwhelming flavor, but it delivers what it says: hops all over. Malt balance is lacking, obviously. It works for the style. My biggest problem is the somewhat watery mouthfeel and consistency--add some heaviness.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Shultzerdugen,4,"12 oz. brown bottle with enjoy by date of May 25 05.  Poured a dark copper with a clingy light tan head.  Pungent, herbal hops and caramel tinged malt in the smell.  Medium body with mellow carbonation. Bitter hops with a grassy, herbal tone meld with round, grainy malts. Finish is surprisingly dry, just a coating of hops lingering.  The name and the blurb on the bottle both boasted of a bold hop deliverance, but didn't quite live up to it. A sneaky beer with its high ABV and great balance, but I prefer the hop monsters for the style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,SupaCelt,3.03,"Appearance: Attractive amber leaning toward the red side. Small tan and cream head that refused to sustain itself. Not much lacing.  Smell: This one has a more malt based scent than most IPA's do. To be perfectly honest, I get no hop boquet whatsoever. What in the living hell is going on? Is all of my Victory stock old? This stuff is just not that damn good. Am I missing something? This is getting rediculous. Bottled Jan 14, 2005 what is it now? May 5, 2005. This stuff should still be somewhat fresh and flavourful.  Taste: Honey verging on sourness. Caramel. The hops are not too pronounced. Must be they wasted all of em in the Storm King. This is one weak IPA. No dryness in the finish. Weird. I hope this stuff is just old. I just don't see how these Victory beers became so highly reputed. IMHO unworthy of accolades.  Mouthfeel: Yeah it has one. It is fine and beer-like. Light to middy.  Drinkability: Good if you like beers that are not really any particular style. This thing is an abomination of sorts. Not on my list for future consumption, and certainly not on my all star IPA list. This was not a Victory for my taste. I am not trying to hate on this stuff, but I am disappointed.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Truh,3.28,"Made a deal with Beelzebub with this one on 4/29/2005. 16-oz. pint served up unchilled at the Cambridge Common.  Scampy film of pons major and minor covering with a fair amount of stuck and lace throughout the pour. Mahogany hue with a rose tint and some haze, though probably due to some chill, and good action. Caramel, light toffee on nose with some biting hop, though somewhat subdued given the moniker. Surprised by how buttery this is on the mouth as I expected much more of an up front hop bite, but that appears after the over-buttered toast slides off the palate; rose hip and roasted onion touches.  This is a fine offering, but I found it wanting due in large part to its buttery aspects.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Vancer,4.45,"Yepper, great IPA ! From a beautiful amber orange pour, small tan head, to the lavish pull on that hoppy, faint floral & grassy, nothing but pleasure. The tangy mouth followed by tasty burps could last all night. Thought this one was much better that the Two Hearted.  Always thought malts would be my luv, nowI have a new mistress hop-devil to contend with.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,GClarkage,4.33,"04/24/05- Received via trade with Santoslhalper.  Presentation- 12oz dated bottle poured into my Duvel tulip.  Appearance- Ligher orange pour with a nice cream colored head and above normal lacing.  Smell- Nice grapefruit scent with a bit of sweetness.  Taste- Mmmmm, very nice and well balanced brew. Was expecting to be blown away with hops in this one, but what I got was a nice sweet pine and grapefruit hopped beer with a nice amount of added malt.  Mouthfeel- Typical moderate IPA carbonation.  Drinkability- One of the better balanced IPA's I have had. A very nice treat.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,unklesyd,4.44,"Wow, this was not what I was expecting! I thought that by the name I would have a tastebud burner. Not so.  The nose and flavor of this beer are melded well. The hop profile dominates, but is tempered by a floral character which accentuates the smooth character of the hop rather than brandishing their power.  The flavor is not neccessarily crisp, but it is just shy of being snappy, and again very smooth. Slight hint of alchowarmth makes sense according to the ABV.  Excellent IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,ypsifly,4.42,"12oz poured into a pint. The label is stamped ""Enjoy by Jul 22 05"".  Bright amber/orange with a white head that shows decent retention and stickiness.  Strong hops in the nose. Citric, specifically grapefruit. Slightly piney with some malt sweetness underneath.  Quick note of sweet malt followed by a building hop intensity. The finish is bitter and lingers for a bit. Hop heads will bow before this brew.  The mouthfeel is full, at least for an IPA, and this is a very drinkable brew if you like maximum hoppage.  This could give Two Hearted (my favorite IPA) some serious competition.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,LPorter33,3.86,"Puchased a 6 pack from Martignetti's  Appearance = Clear, transparent deep colored amber with nice head retention. Looks like it will be a tasty brew.  Smell = Very strong hop flavor  Taste = Hoppiness from smell comes thundering through in the taste. Offset nicely with a brown sugar like sweetness. This is a fine tasting beer although not spectacular.  Overall = Decent American IPA. I recommend it although it's not at the very top of my list.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Schwarzbart,4.5,Amber-orange in color and a little cloudy with the perfect amount of carbonation and decent cling with a frothy small head. Smell is definately hoppy. Just the right amount of hop flavor with a little bit of spice. It's a little bitter with that typical victory malt flavor. In my opinion the perfect balance of malt and hop flavor for an IPA. Mouthfeel is dry. I will be stocking this one for sure.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,BuckSpin,4.15,"I was fortunate enough to be able to get a few bottles of this at an event I attended. This is one of the better IPA's I have tasted, and its is very drinkable alone or with food, but with a 6.7 ABV you may find out why its called the Devil!  Beautiful deep orangeish-red honey color, with a nice 1.25"" cream head. Not a lot of lace. Maybe the best bouquet of an IPA so far...definitely a citrus nose and mild hops.  Perhaps the name and/or ABV had me in a pre-mind set, but this is one well crafted IPA that can be enjoyed over & over. Slight peppery undertones with a even, smooth taste that has just the right mix of hops. Not too sharp, actually very even with a nice, soft peek of hops at the throat. Ironically, the great citrus nose didn't carry to the taste (there is some fruitiness, but very mild), but so what? This is one even, smooth IPA that I would buy again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Fish113d,4.28,"Pouring into a pint glass, it pours an amber color with lots of white frothy head with beautiful cascading. Aroma is lots of sharp, piney hops that hits your nose hard and a slight grapefruit aroma. Some very little sugars and sweetness comes through also. Taking a sip it comes very smooth and hoppy up front with a buttery feel throughout the swallow. A bit of sugar on the finish along with the citrus tones (underlying). The carbonation balances well with the flavors; medium-bodied IMO. Great tasting brew that is super-drinkable due to the feel. I'm glad I got plenty of this one!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,troutmask96,4.47,"This is just a fantastic brew. Very pretty amber I.P.A. that pours a nice full head. And oh, the smell. Very, very hoppy with a touch of citrus, and rather bitter. The spiciness of this beer is quite unique among I.P.A.'s, which generally lack complexity. Very drinkable, and at 6.7 ABV multiple pours won't do too much damage...",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,asabreed,4.33,"Let me just say that after I've had Hop Wallop a decent amount by now (in addition to having more than 3/4 of the case in the cellar), I'm a bit biased, but I won't let that hurt this review.  Appearance: Hazy golden amber. Lace hasn't stuck to the glass, but initially it has a decent-sized white head. Pretty impressive overall.  Smell: The hops are a bit overpowering, in a way, meaning the citrus isn't allowed to breathe as well as it should, I feel. But the citrus is there, orange zest, lemon peel, oily hops.  Taste: The flavors come out better than the smell, as the oily hop flavor is pretty balanced overall, without being too bitter. The hops aren't overpowering in the mouth, and the aftertaste is also very balanced. Very nice.  Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation, flavors from the smells meld in the mouth and become even better.  Drinkability: Halfway between ""too much to drink as a session"" and ""perfect as a session"" since it's so tasty and is at a moderately high ABV. Can be paired with great foods, and since the ABV isn't extremely high, it's a good beer in both the summer and winter, and should be tried in both seasons to appreciate, or all four if you want to really try your appreciation.  HopDevil seems to be readily available, so if not a case, a 6-pack is definitely worth getting to at least try it. Even if you're new to the IPA style, this is the one to get; this was the one that was newest to me when I really started to appreciate it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,cubedbee,4.43,"Pours a beautiful clear orange with a medium sized lasting head. Smells of citrus and hops. Taste is wonderfully balanced, with the hops taste being clear but never overwhelming. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. This is one of the best and most drinkable IPAs out there.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Kwak,3.9,"Very nice orange color with a hazy cloud to it. Firm thick head disappearing nicely as the drink did. Good smell almost toasted flavor, the hoppy flavor wasn't too much it was just right. this is one beer that goes well with spicy food like curry the hops cut through the heat. Very drinkable a nice food beer!!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,TheGipper,4.45,"I had this during the Victory event at the Blind Tiger. Among the 4 styles of Victory I tried, the good ole' HopDevil still stole the night. I've had The Devil countless times in a bottle and on tap, and even a couple of times from a cask, but it was especially good this time, perhaps because of its freshness. In addition to the lovely hops, this almost perfectly balanced ale has a crisp, slightly burnt maltiness coming through the strong, earthy body. This tasting proved again to me that you just can't go wrong with the Devil.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Litterbean,3.77,"Pours a slightly hazy golden orange. The head is about a finger thick, and there's minimal suds clinging to glass.  Smells very herbal, with hops coming on strong. There's some fruity malts as well but it's nearly masked entirely by the spicy hops.  The first thing I noticed about the taste was the carbonation. It tasted rather sweet at first, but then became exceedingly bitter as it hit the back of my tongue. I could literally imagine myself chewing the hop leaves. It was so powerful that it left my mouth feeling a little gunky and oily afterwards.  All in all, it's a good beer, but I enjoy Stone's IPA more. This one doesn't have enough sweetness to balance it out, but I like hops so I can't really hold it against it. I would have preferred it to be a bit maltier, but on the whole, it's a great beer and one that I'd probably pick up again when I need an old familiar brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,TheDeuce,4.95,"Finally sitting here with a bottle of the legendary HopDevil out of the Victory variety pack....here we go.  Appearance-flawless, a gorgeous red amber color with a huge foamy head that stays and stays and stays, exceptional clarity with active carbonation.  Smell-spicy hop aroma combined with sweet fruit malt, alcohol also seeps through the nostrils but the hops overtake everything by quite a bit.  Taste-velvetey smooth with a rich taste, dark malts puncuate at first followed by a large hop bite, very spicy kicks with some darker flavor (almost chocolate but not quite) seeping through. Viciously flavorful and quite delicious.  Mouthfeel-dark on the palette, hop bite is nice, very flavorful on the palette, a pleasure to drink.  Drinkability-flavorful to the death and deviously drinkable. A top-notch ale that should be enjoyed in all circumstances.  Overall-I am angry that I was so late in finally getting to drink this fabulous beer. A sheer pleasure to drink in every respect and a beer that has acheived its fanfare and fame through sheer drinkability and hop character. A must-try.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,boatyard,3.79,"its got that carmel color with a nice one finger hear that leaves you very soon. leaves some slight lacing, and has that fruity grapefruit smell. at first its a bit malty, and then transitions into citrus. I feel its a little thick for an ipa, little syrupy, however goes very well with a ribeye steak. feels ok in your mouth, and if you wait for that tingly sensation its way good. Good example of a hoppy ale, and one of Victories staple points. I hear Victories hop wallup is good stuff, but if you can't find it, this is good stuff.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,jward,4.75,"Burnt orange in color, with rings of off-white lace down the side of a HopDevil pint glass, which announces that this is a ""Champion Beer."" Indeed, the title is well deserved! The nose presents fragrant flowery hops, fruity with hints of pine and butterscotch. The strong citrusy hops dominate the flavor, with notes of grapefruit and lemon. But they sit atop a wonderful caramely malt backbone, rendering this beer well balanced and quite drinkable. The mouthfeel is sturdy and appealing.  This one is even better on cask. Bravo Victory!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,BeerFink,4.3,"Pours a cloudy dark reddish orange with a slight off white head. Smell is estery, fruity, slightly malty. Taste is big hops with some toasted malt fighting its way through to the end. The malt provides a good balance to the assault of citrous and pine hop flavors. Slight breadiness from the malt smooth out the sharpness of the hops. There is an spicy flavor that is there from the beginning and lingers in the aftertaste with those lovely alpha acids. That spice makes this quite a good winter ale.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,palma,2.82,"I honestly gave this beer a few chances before I reviewed it. Now I'm convinced. This beer is just not that good overall, and definitely not a good IPA. I have no idea why this beer is rated so high. Amber body with not much of a head. Nice sweet hoppy aroma with some citrus that even my gf liked. Taste is a different story though. Is this a marco pale ale Im drinking? Where the hell is the flavor? It tastes so stale and bland in my opinion. Watered down. Dead hop flavor. I need some hops here. They call this beer HopDevil? I call that false advertising.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Rio,4.33,"Poured a hazy copper color with low cabonation, thick off-white head that receeded to a thin layer, but left a heavy lacing on the glass. Aroma is heavy of a pine needle smell, but with a bit of a citrusy hint to it, as well.  Heavy dose of hops jump you at first taste of this one. The earhty and floral flavors mix with a kick ass spiciness that really makes this beer shine, and definitely shoves the toasted malts right out of the spotlight. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth and creamy.  A truly excellent brew. The aroma doesn't quite do justice to the ass kicking your taste buds are about to receive, but everyone likes a surprise, right? Unfortunately, I imagine drinking a few of these would leave your taste buds in a comatose state for a few days.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,DESTRO,4.2,"proof that a great IPA dosnt have to wreck your tastebuds and tip you over after one bottle. pours out a nice red tinged sunset and smells of wonderful citrus hops. taste is solid and balanced, a firm dose of hops with enough malt backbone to keep up. some light sweetness, bitter but not overly so, lightly spicy. medium bodied, somewhat filling but not a bloater. a very well rounded beer that shows its mucles with balance and flavor insted of all out bitterness. top notch.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,PossumJenkins,4.12,"On tap at Firewaters in Atlantic City, N.J. As were some other reviewers, I was very surprised at how well-balanced this beer was. It reminded me a lot of Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale, which is a good thing. Probably a bit hoppier than SNCA, but the hops are not overwhelming as I feared. Drinkability quite high. I would definitely buy this beer if I could find it anywhere in my area.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,connecticutpoet,4,"This was a nice amber beer with a one finger head that left a fair amount of lacing.  The aroma was of citrusy hops, mainly grapefruit. No real pine or resinous scents to speak of. Seemed the right level, if a little restricted and one-sided.  The taste was bitter, smooth, and not overpowering, with a mix of floral and grapefruit hops. It was not as bitter as I would have expected... a little too mild considering its name and reputation, IMHO.  Mouthfeel was about what expected from the hop balance, and it was pretty drinkable... I would have rated it higher, had it been a little less mild and a little more bitter. I like a bit more of that from an IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,ggroller,3.71,"I am generally a huge fan of this beer and of all Victory products. The bottle I am reviewing, however, left a little to be desired. Maybe it was the Speakeasy I had before it, maybe it was a bad bottle. Who knows. Anyway, aside from the pronounced hoppy fruitiness I picked up on what I can only describe as a sort of rancid mayonaisse typet taste. Not good. I will try this one again from time to time as I have in the past. Hopefully the next one will be better.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,warriorsoul,4.56,"Victory really sets the bar w/ their brews....a 16oz. bottle has been poured... A deep, hazy, orange w/ a full finger of head...caramel in color. Beautiful lace that lingers forever. Smell is nothing overpowering, but you can sense how good this beer is going to be....you can smell a hint of citrus and american hops. Clean and crisp taste w/ a nice bitter aftertaste. The beer has some malt to it and a bouqet of hops, which justifies it's name. Make no mistake, this in no where close to the ""Hop Wallup""...this is the one you can drink all evening. Perfect carbonation...keeps you salivating for more. I always try and keep this beer on hand...if you want to go take a chance on an IPA you've never tried, go buy this tonight. If you can't find it, let me know...I'll hunt it down for you.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,tweeder263,4.7,"Pours into a pint glass a beautiful amber with a slightly off white 2 finger head. Great smell of hops.Taste is hops but in no way overbearing,beautifully balanced with malt side just as powerful. A great session brew for me,,a must to keep in stock.A+",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,FormatKid,4.1,"12 oz bottle poured into a standard pint glass.  The appearance is relatively standard to that of an IPA the body may be a shade darker than I am used to though, a dark ruby-colored amber. The head is off-white, meager from the pour and short lived. Spider-web thin veins of lace manage to cling to the glass.  The malt is a bit more heavy-handed on the nose than I would expect. There are nice hop aromas but they are a bit subdued when compared to some other beers of the style. Green hop aromas of pine and tangerine combine with the malt creating a candy-like aroma.  Light and sweet malt up front on the palate. The bitterness is firm but not heavy-handed, the hop flavors emerge with smacks of lemon-zest, light pine-needles, and grapefruit. This beer is very tangy in the aftertaste.  A very well-balanced IPA, highly drinkableI have to admit Id like a bit more aromatics and hop bite though.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,beveragecaptain,4.22,"12 ounce bottle. Pours a slightly hazy amber color with little head. Sweet malt aroma with earthy hops. The flavor is a great balance between malt and hops. Starts out with a malty sweetness, and then the hops come in with a spicy flavor. Finishes very bitter. While this is not the hoppiest IPA you will ever try, it has a great hop flavor. The great drinkability makes this a fine choice to pick up a case off.  The bottle I am sampling from is a couple weeks past the best by date, so it does not have the fresh hop taste of a new bottle. It is still, however, a quality IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,hobbes2112,4.47,"12 oz. bottle  Another gem that I picked up while in Ohio.  Pours a dark orange with amber core. One finger off-white head that leaves a small lacing. Head moves down to about the 5mm level and stays there the entire time.  Smell is more complex that some IPAs that I have had recently. Of course there are the pine and citrus notes but there are a lot more spices around.  Taste is a very similar to the aroma, one of those ""WYSIWYG"" beers. Lots of hops in addition to spices and a significant earthy character.  I am more impressed by this beer than I expected, I haven't had good luck with some of the ""top 100"" hyped beers.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,swamiswamu,4,"Dare I say it... it could use some more hops to live up to the name. When I picked up this bottle I expected a completely uneven hop monster. Quite to the contrary, this bad boy is pretty damn balanced. Caramel malt is all over the place. This isn't a bad thing. It was a delightful surprize. This is my first brew from Victory and I'm pleased.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,mobyfann,4.32,"Paid $7.99 for a 6'er from the Jungle...  This beer pours a clear amber body with a small white head, good retention and a speck or two of lacing... The aroma is a hop factory at full production and it's a wonderful hop smell with another nice smell of German malt.  The taste is wonderful, the balance of hops and malt is moreso here than the overpowered hop smell. The mouthfeel is something Victory has down in every beer, this one is smooth and nice on the palette. The drinkability is near perfect at 6.7% you can't even notice a tocuh of alcohol and could be a session beer if you have a high tolerance.  Final Thought: This is a great beer with a weak appearence... one of the best IPA's out there.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,HogHill,4.6,"Pours a warm amber color with good clarity, which in contrast to it's sibling Hop Wallop, is a light golden beer. Head is a nice off white which laces around my pint glass.  Smell: You can tell this is an American IPA with a whiff. Strong hop aroma, with a hint of grapefruit. Do they sell this in a candle?  Taste: This is a rock solid American IPA, it has a good balanced of hops to malt. The hops win but the malts do show up. A pleasing piney aftertaste finishes it off. Very drinkable, I can go through a few of these and still crave more of the deveil's alphas. Victory brews a damn fine IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Wonderful smooth hop bite. Great biscuity malt backbone. Alcohol is noticeable but less than, say, SNCA. Medium to full body. The complexity of the flavors makes this beer highly drinkable.  Overall: an excellent complex IPA with smooth bitterness.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,AlexJ,4.4,"In spite of all the many great beers i've had in my time, this remains a favorite, it's always good. Darker than most, it pours a deep amber with a chunky oatmeal colored head. Excellant retention with heavy lacing. Smell of glorious hops balanced between citrus and spruce, tantalizing. Wonderfully full hop flavor rounded by a perfect balance of malt. Orange/grapefruit marmalade contrasted by spicy/biting pine, this is perfection! Warning, a sip may lead to mass consumption so buy at least a sixer!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,canucklehead,4.3,This is a big IPA that has much in the malt backbone. I get the fresh hops nose and the IBU's are certainly there but after two or three sips I noticed the malty midbody and the strong finish. Like all Victory products brewers skill is readily apparent in this very nice beer.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,clvand0,3.8,"Pours a red color with a small head that dies off quickly and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is very hoppy, but not as arrogant as I expected it to be. There is some caramel malt that can be detected in the back. The flavor is surprisingly balanced. There is a nice malt character to battle the large amount of hops. Well done.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,francisweizen,4.5,"Handpull from the Drafting Room in Exton. Orangey copper colour, bordering on red this time around. Hmmmm, darker on cask are we? Head is small bits of white, lacing is not good. Aromas are less hoppy and more malty than I seem to recall. The taste is actually a bit more calm than the devil on tap, but it is no less amazing. Hoppy up front with a very bready malt flavor in the middle and a clean finish. Mouthfeel is cask goodness, drinkability does not waver. Three serving types and three 4.5's across this board. Perhaps Victory should rename their flagship brew ""Consistent Devil""",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,santoslhalper,4.62,"Pours a warm amber with a tan head. Smells very hoppy with pines shining through. In the mouth it tastes great. Hoppy, but not overly hoppy. Hop falvors range from pine to citrus to full-on bitterness. A nice amound of malts start shining through towars the finish, but it ends quite hoppy. A very well rounded ""IPA"" with a great aftertaste. This is one of my favorite beers, I don't know how I managed to skip reviewing this one. This is a common find in my fridge. A classic beer, and one that I will cherish forever. Cheers, my friends.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,zbs,4.09,"Pour immediately overcome with a division of tiny spherical parachuters rocketing in reverse. Smell is damp with rich but distant foam of raisin. After several the head seems to form a Mandlebrot formation on the glass. Hops, of course. The alcohol is faint in a warmth that spreads across the palate. Could be more voluptuous, but I like them skinny. Certainly enough to work with. Droopy lacing follows but the parachuters keep coming long as I can manage to contain myself.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,rousee,3.65,Pours a cherry/almond color with very little head which drops to a wisp in a few seconds. It does leave some lace on the sides of the glass.  Smell is not nearly as strong as I would expect with a name like Hopdevil. It is hoppy but not very and it does seem to have some hops-malt balance. It has a little mustiness on the nose also. Not a negative but not really a postive either.  The taste is good but it doesn't really jump out for me. I like a DFH 60 min. IPA much better than this. Stil decent though. Finishes bubbly and balanced with a fuzzy mouthfeel. Its okay for drinkability -not as good as others in this style.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

It pours a dark brown red not unlike apple cider with a tan head that collapses quickly. Some stickiness in the glass.  Smell is moderate hop bite, not overwhelming with a nice malt back to it.  Taste is a great malt and hop combo. Sure they ratcheted up the hops, but they also pumped up the malt to keep it balanced.  Mouthfeel is smooth and not prickly. A little thick, though.  I could drink these all night long.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,HochFliegen,3.82,"While pouring the beer I could smell the sweetness and the hops flowing out of the glass. It poured a hazy copper color. Very little head to speak of just a thin whisp of off white foam coating the top of the beer. The smell was very sweet with the scent of raisins dominating. I could also detect the hops nicely mixing in with the maltiness. The taste started out very malty with some sweetness to it and slowly turned to a nice crisp hop bitterness. It finishes a tad bit dry with a nice bite in the end. Carbonation also seemed right on, not to much, just enough. Its a good beer with a very bold taste.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,lackenhauser,3.46,"Nice amber orange color-no real head but theres some nice lacing on the glass. Subtle hop aroma-doesnt scream like a lot of the US- IPAs. Nice flavor-malty backround with a big,upfront hop presence. Very citrusy-grapefruit like,spruce? A touch of residual malt sweetness in the end. Nice solid body An enjoyable beer all around-another fine effort by Victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Doppel07,4.48,"Pretty red-orange hue with significant carbonation and a silky cream-colored head with scattered, arachnoid lacing. Nice malty sweet and flowery nose with a subtle hint of diacetyl and light caramelization. Very well-balanced flavor with great cherry-caramel maltiness and subdued hop profile for an American IPA. This review is based on a less than fresh sample consumed two weeks after the drink before date and I actually prefered this one over the many fresh samples that I've had in the past. Moderate cellaring took some edge off of the hop character and really opened up the malt base. A great American IPA that still pays homage to its English ancestors, particularly when its allowed to mature in a nurturing environment.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,trancefishy,3.38,"Pours out a rich copper colour, with a mediocre off white head and coarse carbonation that quickly retreats. Aroma is big floral hoppiness, bit of citrus and perhaps jasmine. The taste doesnt seem to be an accurate reflection of the aroma, though; its non-existant for a moment, then builds a bit to a hoppy bitterness, with a finish that tastes like a not-so-good grapefruit. A malt sweetness is also present, but, I dont think it meshes well with the rest of the flavours. Mouthfeel is creamy and medium body. I was expecting this beer to be a lot more hoppy than it is. for the record, this 6 pack has a best before date of a little over a month ago, so, I think that may have something to do with it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,beerceller99,3.45,"12 oz. bottle pours a burnt orange color. Has a one finger head that fades quickly. Earthy, smokey smell. The taste is of caramel, smoke, at first then a rush of fresh floral hops in a medium body. Finishes with a slightly bitter grapefruit bite. Not bad, but not fresh tasting either.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,CAMRAhardliner,4.58,"I finally tracked this beer down in TO. They have it at the great Cafe Volo.  It poured a brilliant copper red color with a respectable sized frothy head that left loads of lace trails. The aroma is of citrusy, piney hops up front, but also a competent honey nutty maltiness. The taste is a mass of layered hop flavors, very floral, piney, citrusy and resinous. Its definitely less focused on the Grapefruity Cascades than Liberty Ale (one of the only other APAs Ive tried). The intense hoppyness is kept to heel by a big bold maltiness, theres graham crackers and a nuttyness in the malt profile. The carbonation is soft making for a very subtle medium bodied mouthfeel. The finish is very bitter and lingers for a while. This beer is infinitely drinkable and refreshing.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,RoterTeufel,4.35,"Victory HopDevil Ale has a beautiful red coloring to it with very mild carbonation. Head retention is good, with 1 to 2 cm that produces lovely Belgian lace. It smells of hops and malt, but the hops are the predominating aroma. It has a well ballanced taste, for something that is called ""HopDevil""; the hops are definitly there, but I was plesantly suprised to have such a balance of the two. It is smooth & begs you for another sip, but be careful with this one at 6.7% ABV. An excellent beer by all respects.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,sulldaddy,4.17,"I am sampling a chilled beer in a pint glass. The brew pours a clear amber color with a soft fluffy beige head foaming up very easily about 2 cm. Aroma is all hops with piney scents mixing with sour grapefruit and some lighter floral scents too. The first sip reveals a lighter body than expected and a slightly oily texture. There is a very mild carbonation.Hop flavor is present almost immediately after a brief sugary sweetness on my lips. The hop flavors are primarily pine and grapefruit, similar to the nose. The beer is very smooth and easy to drink even for the strong hoppiness that exists.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,mattcrill,4.33,"Appearance: Pours a cloudy carmel/amber color with a tan head.  Smell: grapefruit up front, a little flowery (roses maybe), and a little malt sweetness in the background. Very inviting.  Taste: A grapefruit/citrus punch to the palate. Some flowery hops follow it up with bitterness in the background. There is a definite malt presence as I pick up a sweet aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied but chewy and complex.  Drinkability: Highly drinkable. I expected a hop bomb. This is definitely a complex, well done beer. It's not over the top but it's definitely hoppy. I really enjoyed this one and I don't consider myself a hop-head.  Another fine beer from Victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Skidz,4.75,"thanks to both ppoitras and shippos for the trade.  ""Enjoy by June 06 04"" --- oops, I held on to this one for awhile longer than expected.  Pours out a light amber brown and sits a foggy caramel red in the glass with a mighty, fluffy off-white head. Lacings are wonderful.  The aroma is intense, with hops bouncing around on every side of your nose, filling your head with soothing aromas. Mildly citric with light traces of pine. Caramel and nuts lurk beneath. There is nothing wrong with an IPA that smells as good as this one. Doesn't try to set you back by overloading it with hops, rather, it presents itself delicately with a healthy dosage.  Tastes nicely malted up front with caramel sweetness. Hopping is clearly evident soon after, as flavors begin to mingle with one another. Some grapefruit citrus flavors along with hints of fresh pine bring out the front of the hoppings. The balance of malts and hops is just dead on, there is not much more to say about it. Flavor is nothing short of amazing.  Fills your mouth with it's wide range of flavors and medium-full body. Carbonation is well controlled and matches the smooth and cleanly polished body.  By far, one of the best IPA's I've ever had. It's a shame I can't see this one regularly, as it makes me so happy to pop one open and treat myself to a great tasting beer. This beer has it where it counts, right in the mouth. It's all there. I need to move to a better state.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,fdrich29,4.07,"On tap at Bison County, Waltham, MA  Pours amber/copper orange. Good size creamy head that quickly shrinks down to near nothing.  Smells of fruit, hops and flowers.

There are better IPA's out there, but this one is quite good.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,kmpitz2,4.42,"This beer pours a nice pale amber color with a finger and a half of head that falls to barely cover the beer. The nose is very earthy piney hop with an almost smoked caramel sweetness from the malt. The hop is not quite as strong as I would want in the flavor. The flavor is just a bit flat overall. I have to say I'm a slight nit disappointed with this. The beer is moderate to thick. Drinkability is actually very high on this, but it is due to the sacrifice in flavor. I want to try this one again, as I assume that this bottle is a bit past date, because the hop just should be more in this beer. I'm convinced of it.  Edit: I picked up a fresh bottle of this, so heres what I find different. The nose is a bit more hop than I remember, with some citrusy grapefruit in there. I like it. The flavor is pretty nice as well. The hops carry through well. I like it. I'm more impressed with this beer this time.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Jacobier10,4.3,"On-tap @ Fire Waters in Atlantic City, NJ  Pours a light orange color. Great aroma. Tons of floral hops mixed with some light hops. A nice frothy head remains consistent throughout the duration of the beer. The initial flavor is a bit acidic, but it calms down as you drink and settles into a great tasting IPA. Be careful though, this beer is almost to easy to drink and has a fairly high ABV. One of the better IPA's I've ever had. This one competes with Stone Ruination in my book. Tough to decide which one I like better. Enjoy!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,sutcliff,3.79,"The beer pours a lovely caramel color with a full hop aroma and is an excellent example of an American IPA. Good clean malts in the background. The alcohol is not noticeable.

Overall, a pleasant brew and a joy for hop lovers.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,brewQ,4.32,"A nice looking auburn colored brew. Floral and furity aromas abound.. Head is creamy albeit thin. The sheathing clinging to the sides of the glass tell me they have some malt body here to balance the hops.  Unlike so many others loosely categorized in this style, Victory satisfies my expectations of an IPA.  After a few of these I'd be ready for the seven course meal.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,goose114,3.71,"""Menacingly Delicious""  Best before: 10.1.04  This is one of the first IPAs I enjoyed when I started getting into craft beer about a year ago, and I'm sorry that it's been about that long since I've had it. Pours a deep golden color with lots of sticky foam that lingers on the sides of the glass. As other reviews point out, this IPA is a bit ""spicier"" and drier that some of the other offerings out there; a real treat for anyone who truly loves and honors the beauty of the hop, in my opinion. If you don't like other IPAs, you certainly will not enjoy this. If you do like IPAs in general, this is a must try.

The nose was spicy and citrusy with a doughy, malty backbone, that sometimes smelled like a danish. Taste was spicy up front, slightly fruity and really sour in the middle, like a bowl of warm grape nuits, then comfortably bitter at the finish. The bitterness remained on my palate for quite a while. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Very drinkable. At times, Hop Devil acted like Arrogant Bastard's little brother, but more timid and not so in your face. It's nicely balanced.

345,1005,Southernbrew,4.3,"Dark-orange with a small bubbly head.  Hoppy aroma with a nice bitter and citrusness to it. Nice malt backbone, well balanced.  Medium body, fairly smooth but plenty of carbonation.  Strong citrusy hop flavors up front that become bitter as it moves along. A light earthy flavor comes out, but I don't think this is the freshest bottle, not bad though. It finishes up with a dry bitterness.

345,1005,smcolw,4.32,"Nice sticky lace, but the head dies very quickly. Cloudy and slightly orange in the amber color.  Very fresh dry hop aromas--alluring. The flavors have an excellent blend of round, pale maltiness with a distinct bitter kick of hop. The bitterness lasts long after the swallow. Strong carbonation as well as a strong oily alcohol touch.  This is a superior IPA: full bodied, bitter, aromatic. I'd love to try this one in a blind flight with Stone IPA (my current favorite). This one is very close.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,emericanchaos,4.62,"burnt brown pour with slightly discolored frothy head. head almost looks like guinness's. body is very dark for this style. most IPA's are a lighter brown to resemble their pale hoppy flavor. this devil is extremely dark brown sort of a mahogany as opposed to the typical tanned beech wood color you would expect.  hops explodes from my pint glass. cascade hops especially. almost burns the nose. not much else to comment on aside from that.  the aroma is definetly an indication of how this brew is going to go down. great punch of hops which mellows into a dilluted spice which i'm assuming comes from the yeast. between these two big flavors it's difficult to pick up anything more. hops fans rejoice!!  lots of carbonation mixed in with spicey hops and yeast makes this one an interesting adeventure. swishing around the pallette is a tad sluggish. that slight hesitation makes the bold flavor of this beer even more present. never the less it goes down extremely well.  if you love hops or have enjoyed IPA's this is an easy decision. lovely beer, specially for my fellow hops addicts. this is my craft brew standby. whenever i'm having trouble deciding i goto the devil and you should too.  thank you victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,NEhophead,4.8,"12 oz brown bottle.  Creamy off white head that drifts slowly to the sides. Strong lacing throughout the glass. Hazy yet glowing burnt orange in color.  A variety of hop aromas including: pine,heavy hop oils, and a bit of citrus. The hop aromas are very juicy with a slight burnt smell.  A mouthful of hops is the best way to describe the taste. A touch of citrus and dark fruit hints come out from the hops. Great hop flavor! A great burnt bitterness in the aftertaste along with a slight, warming alcohol presence.  Very smooth alcohol flavor. This is a hefty IPA on the palate, but if you want big hop flavor this is what you need to sacrifice. Well balanced in terms of the variety of flavors on the palate.  A solid session IPA at 6.7% abv. Heaven for a hophead (or should I say hell for a hopdevil?). One of the most flavorful and strong IPA's out there. Actually borders a Double IPA. Very tough to improve on this style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,donnebaby,4.35,"Tan, fuzzy microcream top with lots of sticking. Smell is big fruity hops, heading in the direction of tropical fruits, especially guava.  In the mouth, it's all fruity hops again, but if you were to forget the hops for an instant, then the rich guava jelly and tropical fruits from the nose come right back. Hops strike bitterness in the mouth, move to dryness in the aftertaste, and continue well after that as well. Mildly phenolic at times, like a medicinal soda...but this didn't seem to be bad..  Great structure and balance in this IPA--which makes it highly drinkable.  Had this on-tap at the new Phillies' Citizens Bank Park. Nice to now be able to watch another victory by the Phils and enjoy a Victory brew at the same time. Downside's the plastic cup!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,crookedhalo,4.22,"Pours pretty clear and ambery copper colored with a beige head. rather short-lived. Pine resin and citrusy hop aromas and higher-than-normal (for an AIPA) caramelly malt presence evident in the nose. Black tea-like malt sweetness interplayed with some higher alpha hops. One of the best balanced IPA the States has to offer. Carbonation is about average to sligthly lower, but it lets the flavors ride out as they should. This is a reasoable stong beer that I consider almost too easy to drink. I've been having this beer since it's inception, and it is a good, reasonably priced staple beer. Only problem with it is that I've burnt myself out on it. Flipsiding the coin, I sincerely thank Victory and its PA distributors on burning me out on quality and its ready availability.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Phyl21ca,4.13,Bottle: Poured a clear medium brown beer with a nice head with above standard retention. Aroma is quite nice with the hops defiantly in evidence.

Hopdevil is basically Old Ho with less ABV and a slightly stronger Hop profile. Not sure which one of these fine beers came first, who cares really :) From the first pour it looked and smelled just like Old Ho, with a slightly accentuated hop profile in the aroma, some apple in the aroma as well.

Some note of a bright acid/citrus flavor, lemon, orange?  Taste was a little bit of a letdown. Hops were present, but very polite. My guess is that HopDevil must be brewed with only one type of hop. The flavor was very unified and sad to say, one-dimensional. Compared to other brewers IPA's, I'd really consider this one to be a nice hoppy pale ale rather than a full-up IPA.  Good mouthfeel, very bright and vibrant. Lots of carbonation and ""zest""  An easy beer to drink. Almost a good summer-days bbq beer. Very non-offensive.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,malthead,3.92,"Darkish amber, big white head. Smells hoppy, obviously... citrus, hoppy, some fruit but not overpowering. Taste is very good, a very strong hop presence but still balanced by some malt and bitterness at the finish. As my handle suggests, I'm not too much of a hophead - I still think the mouthfeel is a little too oily, and the drinkability, for me at least, is pretty much limited to having one or two with dinner. (having said that, it goes great with food, I made some Italian last night and it went wonderfully with the olive oil...)

This is definitely a keeper.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,heidelbeerg,4.12,Found this one on tap. The color was a nice light amber with a decent head. The smell was fantastic. I usually have to try real hard to pick up on the sublte aroma in most beer but this one was loaded with it. Very nice hop/citrous smell. The taste was also fantastic. Well balanced maltiness with a good strong hop flavor. This beer was delicious. I could really enjoy several of these. This style is generally not my favorite but I really enjoyed this.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Lots of carmel malt going on with the overall aroma consisting of more malt than hops which surprised me. However the hops were definantly there. Light alcohol spices as well. The taste was also not as hoppy as I was expecting but still very good. The first thing that hit was a strong carmel malt flavor, like the aroma. A strong buttery flavor ran along through the whole swalllow. Hops becoming most evident on the finish with a lot of flavor but little bitterness. The hops were fruity giving of several different flavors. A green apple like zest is also present. Very smooth, body is a little on the light side but this beer is extremely drinkable.

345,1005,brewnut11,4.42,Ah.. the appearence. This brew is a amber color with a nice white head the laces on the side of the glass. The appearence jumps out and says drink me. The aroma of hops explodes out of this bottled beer. It smells like American hop varieties (which I believe are the best) and has much greater aroma than the average IPA. The aroma adds to the taste which packs alot of flavoring hops into this beer. The bittering hops are balanced nicely with the malt and it makes the brew a very drinkable ale.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,wyllder,4.95,"A long time fan of Hopdevil in bottles, it was sure nice to have on tap...  Appearance: Pours a deep amber. Foams to a small head. The color, while not quite as dark as a strong ale, is darker than most IPA's.  Smell: On tap the smell is even more robust than the bottled. Floral hops & with a citrusy tang in the background greet the nose, I don't think an IPA could smell any better.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Yumm.. Bitterness & fruitiness greet the front of the palate, forming a formidable balance of hops & malt. Rushing to the back of the palate the feel is at once smooth and creamy going down only to leave you with a lingering hoppy bitterness, the tastes of sawgrass, hay, and grapefruit topped off with malty sweetness are all there. Just beautiful.  Drinkability: I usually start my sessions with a Hopdevil and often finish them with one too. For a 6.7% ABV, this is, as the label says, dangerously drinkable.

After a month of drinking Natural Light (financial hardship) this brings me back to what beer really smells like. Solid Hop goodness. Lacking the pine scent that I love though.  Taste: Very well balanced. The Hops come through strong, but not overpoweringly. The malt is present on the tip of the tounge.  A very strong example of an IPA.

Aroma, surprisingly spare, if I stretch my nostrils out far and wide I can pick out some remembered flavors, there's fruit aplenty here, peach, grapefruit, apple, even, melon, maybe, but it just doesn't stick out like it used to...or did it? Fruity, yeah, but none too vibrant. Taste: Fruity, again, nice hops, but, really, weak, over all, and they quit the palate with a quickness! Tingly, spicy, but it peters out with a disappointing fervor. There's some caramel-y toasty malt contributions as well, that linger on the palate. Honestly, I recall liking this tremendously once, but perhaps my lips have met too many other, better IPAs in the meanwhile. Body is medium, finish fades fast, comes off rather flat...i've had this from a freshly tapped keg once, and was happy with it then, perhaps I can retry with a fresher bottle (for the likelihood of finding it on tap around here is nil to none)...a nice IPA, but not so spectacular.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Spicy, American hop aroma with moderate grassiness dominates the nose, although there's a nice, estery ale aroma and some malt to be found, also. There's a solid hop presence throughout the initial blast of flavor, ""mid-palate,"" and aftertaste, but it doesn't totally steamroll the malt flavor. The malt flavor reveals some caramel malt with a slight biscuity tinge. Some sweetness hangs around to accompany the hops all the way into the aftertaste. My only complaint -- and it's a minor one -- is that the mouthfeel is a bit thin. For a 6.7% ABV beer with a big all-around hop presence, this is surprizingly -- almost dangerously -- drinkable. I enjoyed every sip of this IPA -- and the head is still there!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Stimack,3.8,"Had this on tap last evening while at Mahars. Brew had a nice deep amber color with a nice light tan head that had very good retention and left lacing through out the brew. The aroma had a strong floral and citrus hop note that did not seem as pungent as when served from a bottle. The taste, a sharp hop hit up front that dominated most of the experience, but I was able to catch enough of a malt taste that tries to balance it out, it fails but with this type of brew that is expected. The finish is still hop, a nice finish to this brew. Ok, now for the thing that has kind of thrown me a bit, I like this brew better from the bottle. Not sure if this brew was getting to its last legs at Mahars but it seemed to lack the character of the bottled version that I know much better. Will try it again on tap in the future and will edit my findings if the differ!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,irishmoss,4.5,"The picture of The HopDevil on the label is very well done, great concept. The pours a deep copper color with slightly off white head that sticks around for a while, then leaves sparse spatters of sticky lace. Nice hop variety goes right to the nose: citrus, grassy, and piney aromas are all there. The first thing that I notice about the flavor, well first thing after the hops, is that the malt presence is actually there. All of these wonderful hop qualities are kept in balance by sweet malt; they compliment each other very well and make this a very enjoyable brew. The mouthfeel is medium with an almost perfect carbonation. The drinkability is unbelievable, this well-balanced IPA comes in at 6.7%, which in my opinion isn't very high, but high enough to get the job done and low enough to not over do it. Great IPA....",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,yeagerbm,4.3,"This is one of my favorite beers and probably the best IPA that I've had, although Duclaw Venom is basically a clone.. A bright orange/amber color and light brown head. It has a very floral and citric hop flavor and aroma. Very refreshing for a beer of moderate alcohol content, this beer goes down very well, full of flavor and very refreshing. It also leaves a nice buzz very quickly at 6.7 abv. Being one of the most flavorful, delicious beers and only 6 dollars per sixer at College Square liquors in Westminster MD this is a top notch brew that will not disappoint any hop head.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,GCBrewingCo,4.3,"The beer poured crystal clear light amber brown. The head was just off-white and lasted well to lace the glass.  The aroma was malty with a strong citrus malt presence which backed off as the head fell.  The flavor was malty with a strong hop presence in bitterness and flavor to balance the malt. The bitterness does not outshine the malt and is well done. The hop flavoring is in check and does not turn the flavor into a phlem stripper as some IPA's try to do.  The finish was dry and pleasantly bitter into the aftertaste. The body was medium.  12 ounce bottle. Enjoy before April 30 04.  I must say I have had this beer on tap many, many times and it certainly is fresher than my bottled example 10 days past the enjoy before date, but the only missing component is the hop aroma and perhaps some of the hop flavor. Still a great IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Tballz420,4.42,"This one has a dark amber colored body, bubbly cream head on top. The scent is oily, sappy, and loaded with hops. For the main course of the taste, this one is featuring delicious hops, with a slick oil feel on the tounge. Some orange characteristics, slightly acidic. Not as intensly hoppy as say hop ottin, i think this beer is better blended than some of the other hops monsters. Great beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,nixhecks,4.08,"Poured a clear light amber color with a sticky cream-tan colored head, good retention. Aroma was of spicy piney hops and a slight alcohol sweetness. Enormous hop taste, but somehow balanced out with a sweetness mid-palate, finishing with a dry spicy hop aftertaste and a twinge of alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel is heavy to medium, and carbonation is low. This is quite a treat for any hop-lover, although it is a bit extreme otherwise.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Smell: Piney hop aroma that wasn't quite as strong as expected given the taste.  Taste: Wow, what a beer! Great piney/grapefruity hop flavor with a nice malt balance. Also detected a slight citrus in the lingering aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Medium/slightly creamy mouthfeel with nice carbonation.

345,1005,crackerpooch,4.52,This beer presents in a 12oz. brown bottle with the freshness date marked. It pours a one finger beige head that has good retention and laces nicely. The beer has a very slight haze and is dark amber in color. A great looking beer.  The aroma is a beautiful thing. A strong hop smell that almost reminds me of freshly cut grass. A great aroma. The first taste is perfect. Slightly sweet malt at first that smoothly transitions into a perfectly strong hop bitterness. Good hop character that is not overwhelming. The beautiful bitterness lasts for quite awhile in the back of the throat. Magnificently balanced. The mouthfeel is medium in body and goes well with the beer. A incredibly drinkable beer.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Mitchster,4.53,"Pours to a semi-cloudy medium-amber, forming a poofy, whipped dark biege head with excellent retention and clumpy lacing. Carbonation is moderate. Aroma is citric, fruity, leafy, juicy, piney hops with a touch of cannabis skunk. Very nice, running the gamut of hop aromas. Mouthfeel is fresh, clean, somewhat soft, with a touch of hop astringency in the finish, and a medium-dense body. Taste is wonderful....full of the juicy sweet fruity hops I mentioned but exquisitely balanced with a smooth malt body with caramel overtones and a little residual sugars to balance out the hops during the lightly toasty finish. Full of hop flavor, yet never caustic or acidic, this is a masterly brew. Bitterness level is very nice, but has a touch of fatiguing leafy harshness towards the end.  In my experience, this IPA is 2nd only to Two-Hearted. This is an amazingly well-crafted brew that I could gladly drink all night. The hops are intoxicating, yet never overbearing. This brew makes me smile from ear to ear. World-class.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,jvajda,4.1,"Appearance: Dark golden brown with a three-finger head. Looks pretty intimidating. Smell: A little less hoppy than I thought, still pretty present though. Taste: A big blast of hops followed by a big blast of bitterness. This one leaves the mouth pretty dry. Mouthfeel: Perfectly carbonated. Drinkability: I was a little let down by this IPA, but it's still good and can be enjoyed in most situations.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Skywave,4.15,"Pours to a frothy, permanent head and orange color. Aroma was typically hoppy. Flavor was more complex than the typical American IPA, with distinctive British fruitiness and spicy hop flavor mingled with malty sweetness. Finishes nicely bitter and refreshing. A very good bottled IPA. This stuff must be even better on tap.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,andyo,4.2,"This is my first brush with a victory beer. I was very excited to taste this beer after reading so many great reviews of this brewery. I picked up a 6 of this for $7.30 (after tax) from a wholesaler here in Virginia Beach.  Poured out real nice, creating a frothy, thick head that rested gently for a long period of time. The color was a rich copper- slighlty orange.  Mouthfeel was medium, with citrus flavors reminiscent of lemon and orange coming through. It reminded me slightly of ""Three Floyd's Alpha King"". Very crisp and zesty; easy to drink. The hops were distinct, but not overbearing. All in all, it was a very refreshing, well balanced beer that I am sure I will enjoy again and again!  ....I can't wait to try the Storm King Stout!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Charthepirate,3.82,"A very solid IPA, and one step away from a truly great beer.  Pours a little cloudy, with a small, but sticky head. Deep roasted colors are a feast for the eyes.  Smell of toasted grains and caramels followed by a big wallop of hops.  Feels nice and chewy in the mouth, small hints of of sweetness, caramel, and roasted malts. Sometimes notes of Cotten candy pop out. The hops come on big in the back of the mouth, rocking all over the senses. Sometimes they feel just too apbrasive though. It's great, but a touch too much for me.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,BadBadger,4.85,"This is a beautiful beer. Nice head, off-white some what brown, leaves a nice lace on the side of the glass. Smells wonderful, there must be hops in there.

345,1005,PhantomVodoo,4.32,"April '04 review: Tan head atop this dark copper colored beer. Bold aroma of piney, floral hops with pale caramel malt underneath. Big piney, floral hop flavor. Pale caramel malt backbone that falls a bit short of balancing this beer. Relatively smooth, yet very bold and hoppy. Good mouthfeel and drinkability. Maybe not quite as high up on the chart now that I've sampled more IPA's, but still darn good.  11/02 review: I mandated a pitstop at Victory's while driving through PA on a family vacation. I had the Hop Devil on tap and brought some home. This is probably my favorite IPA. Agressively hopped, but not overly bitter with an awesome flavor. Nice aroma. Beautiful coppery color I love in my IPA's and pale ales. This is one of those beers I appreciated more and more the more I drank. It left me longing for more. Much to my delight, they now distribute to Ohio. I must admit that overall, I wasn't impressed with many of Victory's other beers. Not that they were bad, but the Hop Devil and their Storm King Imperial Stout seemed to be a notch or 2 above the rest of their lineup. But the Hop Devil is absolutely top notch and always welcome in my refrigerator.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Beaver13,4,"The Hop Devil pours a copper-orange with a pillowy off-white head that has good retention and exhibits some lacing.  Its aroma is strong hops with a nice citrus balance, along with some malty cookie underneath.  The taste is fruit and bready malt initially followed by a big piney hop bang. The hops are nice and strong with a lingering bitter taste, but the beer remains very nicely balanced. More malts come out as the beer warms. It has a nice smooth and creamy mouthfeel.  Overall, this is an excellent IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,HardTarget,3.36,"Enjoy by May 13, 04 (sampled 4/14/04). Bottle wasn&#8217;t quite full, a lot of headspace. Given recent posts on how this beer doesn&#8217;t age well, this might be a factor. Aroma: Combination of spicy and fruity hops with a hint of malt base. Appearance: Nice clear amber with yellow tinged edges. Multi-sized bubble light tan head that left spots of lace as it receded, but not much. Flavor: The malt is subtle but really keeps the hops in check. I found that the malt started to show late in the beer as it started to warm. Hops are of course the main show, but their act is somewhat restrained. This really struck me as more of a pale ale than an IPA. The hop taste is well presented, but just a little low-key with some tea like flavors. Mouthfeel: Noted some hop oil in the feel and a little alcohol burn in the finish of this medium to heavy bodied beer. Oily coat lasts. The beer is pretty smooth and soft. Overall Impression: Wow, what a let down. I paid big bucks to get this shipped to me given the reputation it had, and while it nicely presented a hop taste, there just wasn&#8217;t any &#8220;bang&#8221;. Drinkability doesn&#8217;t suffer, I&#8217;d gladly drink these at length, but I&#8217;m not ordering any more. If it was the local tap, I could see getting excited about this drinkable IPA, but the beer just was too mild mannered. Hop DEVIL? Devil took my $20 bill and vanished in the air. I just don&#8217;t see this as a top 20 beer. Good, yes. Outstanding? Not to me.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,cokes,3.03,"Golden-leaning copper topped by thin bone suds. Malty nose (yes, malty). And fairly vacant too. Caramel toast with glimmers of herb-coated citrus fruits. Just a touch piney as well. It all seems so rote and unnoteworthy.  This is a highly-esteemed IPA?  Seriously?  Maltiness holds up well enough. There's goodly amounts of caramel-draped bread dough. So far, so good. It turns a bit toasty later on. Alright. Well done. But then... The hops dribble out. Premature ejactulation-style. Lightly piney and floral and citric. But not in any sort of cohesion. And without any force. The finish is tea-bittered, and weak. The thinnish mouthfeel does not help matters. I've had high regards for every other Victory product I've consumed. Hence, I entered with large expectations. But this....this left me scratching my head, and wondering why anyone gives a shit about it. Maybe absolutely fresh makes all the difference. But right now, absolute indifference is all I feel. Thanks, anyway, Bighuge, for the opportunity.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,watermelonman,4.15,"This poured to a nice brownish orange with an outstanding head. It's leaving a thick lace that looks great.  The smell has just a touch of pine along with that nice punch of hops. The hops do dominate but it's still pretty well blended. Alcohol becomes evident in the finish.  Not quite perfect, this is still a very good beer",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,DaveGood,4.25,"While going to see a friend's band perform at the North Star bar, I was pleasantly surprised to find this on tap. It poured out a hazy copper color with a creamy thick semi-tan head. The smell was dominated by a sweet-fruity aroma with a sweet malt undertone. The taste was very similar to that of the aroma, as it was full of bitter hops and some spices. While the hops are over-powering, they are not overwhelming at all. The mouthfeel is extremely smooth. I could easily sit back and enjoy several of these before I realized how many I actually had. Kudos to Victory for creating this wonderful IPA!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,ism,4.03,"Wonderfully hoppy bouqet emanating from a tall, light peach head with great retention, leaving moderate lacing. Deep caramel-amber body is pretty clear. It's full for this style, with moderate carbonation. Can't detect the spice the label claims is in here, the only shortfall. Amazingly heavy with malts balanced well with the hops, fruity undertones stimulating the palate. An interesting brew, and although I like my IPAs extremely hoppy, this is an excellent example of the style; very rich and full of flavor.  And hey, isn't the illustration on the label the cutest thing? Hops with horns and a devilish smile, quite characteristic of this brew. If you haven't tried IPAs, try this, then the Dogfish 60, and work your way up. Once you go hop, you never stop.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,govtmule,4.25,"I'm not a big fan of IPAs. So, I was ready to be disappointed with all of the hype. But I wasn't disappointed. This is probably the best IPA I've had.  I had it in a bottle ($3.50) at Monk's in Philly. It was darker than I was expecting from an IPA. It was dark in Monk's but, to me, it still looked more dark than than golden. Lots of hops obviously, but I don't think they kill you. They balance it well enough (I guess with the high alcohol content? -I know it's probably in a beer 101 article).  If you like IPA you'll like it...if you don't like IPA you might like it anyway.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Lafe,4.72,"Ahh Hopdevil, how I love thee.  I'm a fan of the IPA style of beer, and I believe that Hopdevil is exemplary of the style. Big on malt and hops, this beer satisfies.  The pour reveals a pretty amber color, fairly clear with only a hint of haze (I can read this screen, albeit backwards, through my pint glass). The aroma is strongly hoppy, with a bit of malt behind it. A half-inch or so of head forms, then diminishes to a lacy covering. A good bit of lacing occurs on the side of the glass as the beer inevitably dwindles within.  The first taste is hoppy in flavor, and surprisingly well balanced between the bitterness and malty sweetness. One normally expects an IPA to be hoppy, and this one is, but not to the detriment of the malt base. The mouthfeel is substantial but not cloying, with hop oils playing a leading role. The sweetness of the malt and bitterness from the hops leave a very balanced sensation, from beginning to end. Carbonation is spot on, and supports the mouthfeel perfectly.  Overall, this beer is extremely satisfying, and well worth the $8ish per sixpack at which i can acuire it locally. It has become a staple in my beer fridge. Definitely one of my favorite, and most drinakable, commercial IPAs. (The other is Tupper's Hop Pocket).",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Smells exciting -full of hops, hops, and probably some more hops.  So why not? I took a sip and of course the beer was jumping in my face with hops. I was glad. I like the hops - and this beer delivers.  BUT(and there is always a but), as delicoius as this beer is, they didn't seem to bother to provide a complex series of hops. I have enjoyed some IPAs and other hoppy style beers lately which provide hits of hops to different areas of the tongue and mouth. This beer does not do that. This beer simply beats you square in the mouth and surrounds your whole mouth with hops.  So in short, good in flavor, poor in subtlety.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Taste is typicla to high alpha-acid hops IPA, very lemony, grapefruity. A tart and bitter mix with no stand out quality. Body is clean, rather thin with a biting carbonation. Overrated from my perspective, not even among my favorite half of the style I believe, but the aroma is good and quite complex.

A very grapefruit flavor.  The taste was very sweet and malty. Much more malty that I had expected. It was very mild for an IPA I thought. There was a slight tinny flavor at the end that wasn't very pelasant.  The mouthfeel was a good consitency. For how malty it was it had a nice consitency.  A very drinkable brew.

It's very bitter. id say if someone made a tea from hops, this is what it would taste like.

The color is reddish brown, like cinnamon.  In the nose, the aroma has hints of malt, raspberry and caramel, all of which are present bringing the aroma into the mouth. It is surprisingly complex.  The first sip offers an expected but pleasantly strong floral hop character. What I do not expect is the malt: it's very evident and underpins the hops perfectly. It has a very light mouthfeel, which is an achievement given the strong malt character, and the carbonation is spot on for the style: medium-to-high and very crisp. At its coldest, it doesn't appear too complex: the malts and hops are dominant and at first do not offer any other characteristics. As it warms mid glass, the above-average alcohol becomes evident, but balances perfectly with the malts and hops.

The initial taste isn't undelicious. There's a good caramel sweetness that fades into a chamomile-like hop flavor (I don't know another word for the columbus hop flavor). There is a good creamy body to this beer, but the bitter aftertaste is a bit harsh.

345,1005,babyhobbes,4.12,"This came with a slightly off-white head overflowing the glass. Head dissipated to a soapy looking film. The smell is fruity and hoppy...very inviting. The taste is marvelous, with fruits, hops and even a little maltiness which seems to balance the whole deal. It's not very bitter with hops and goes down smooth.  Thanks Victory!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,RocketWidget,4,"Pours a hazy gold with good lacy white head. Smells of (what else) hops, quite pungent. Taste is quite hoppy, but with a name like Hopdevil, I assumed that I would be blown away by hoppy flavors, but I feel I have enjoyed more hoppy beers. Still, a fine brew overall, and a very good one to blend with almost any food. I would argue that in this respect, it is quite Pilsner-like. A fine sampling from Victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,BCMan,3.59,"HopDevil taught me to love and appreciate a good hoppy beer. This beer is amber in color with a strong hop bouquet. The head built quickly but faded back again nearly as fast. As with the nose, the taste of this brew is just the same, hoppy. This beer I can drink at any given time but may need to be in the mood to have a sixer. This is one of my favorite beers and next to Storm King it's my favorite from Victory. The labels from Victory are very distinct so they stand out. I've criticized them for being so plain but others I've spoken to on on this topic loves the labeling for that reason. My rating, What'sa Hop'inen Hot Stuff!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Popsinc,4.47,"A beautiful amber pour with a small head. The nose was ripe with hoppiness. And i mean lots of hoppiness. There was a small fruitiness in the nose as well. The taste was also super hoppy which was great and balanced out nicely with my thai curry chicken. There was also a rich maltiness that gave this beer enormous backbone. The mouthfeel was extremely smooth and moderatley creamy. A great combination of hops, malt and light fruitiness gave this beer exceptional range. Fantastic. My favorite IPA around.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,gnaussea,4.35,"Pours a beautiful amber with a hint of copper. Nice head that settles moderately, leaving a hint of lace. Smell is actually akin to Stone, with a beautifully balanced aroma of cascade hops over amber malt. Taste is not as much like stone. Cascade hops are even more prominent, yet at the same time this beer achieves an indescribable balance. Hops are overpowering all other flavors, but I have trouble setting the glass down. A wonderful brew, to be sure.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,hustlemuscle,4.58,"The Hop Devil simmers in the glass, as golden as the final rays of a sunset, and an aggressive pour yields a cumulonimbus of a head, fluffy and tan. The carbonation lends to a slightly cloudy appearance. A fruity bouquet is a very gentle accompanyment to the reddish golden hue. A good looking beer.  The stuff goes down easy, fruity with a sharp, but not overpowering, tang to it. It is very smooth, the tangyness being the only thing that would prevent me from drinking a few. Oh, that and the pretty decent alchohol content. This a beer that can really sneak up on you, the sweetness and smoothness hiding the punch. That makes two of the Victory beers, and neither disappoints. Can't wait for next season's beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,budsboy,4.04,"12 oz. bottle with devilish-looking green hop monster and glowing red heat from behind. But, it's got that wonderful ""V"" for Victory too, so I'll forgive the gaudiness.  Pours a nearly clear (murkier than expected) light amber, small white head.  Hops comes to the nose in spades, and cinamon with a touch of fruit. All-in-all pleasing.  Taste is not as bosterous as I expected, but strong. Tangy and sharp, zippy and bitter. Hopped up and ready. Finishes with spice, going to the edge of a spiced beer, in fact. Good if your not in the mood, near nirvana if you are.  This was my second shot at HopDevil. My first happened to be had on the exact date printed as the ""Best by"" date on the bottle. The second was a good month before the best by date. There was a considerable difference. I've thrown out the first experience and based this review on the second. This brew mellows with age, but mellowness doesn't suit it. The fresher, the better.  Oh, yea ... Thanks to new member Hustlemuscle for the fresh brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,UnionMade,4.85,"A wonderful hand pulled pint at Mug's Ale House in Brooklyn. The beer arrives in a tall nonic pint. The liquid is a deep ruddy amber, topped with a short, creamy ivory head. Good clarity, with excellent head retention and gobs of lace sticking to the glass in rings. The aroma reveals pungent grapefruity hops. Very citric, with some pine and herbal notes. A solid malt backbone with a sweet toastiness playing beneath the hops. A touch of caramel malt, with fragrant appley esters. Unbelievable balance, with every nuance in it's right place. The flavor starts out with rich toasty malt. A light caramel flavor rides through, hoisting the hops through the finish. Just enough appley fruitiness comes through the middle, with a touch of pear. A robust grapefruity hop flavor edges it's way in rather early, quickly stealing the show in the finish. Light herbal and pine flavor comes through, but it's mostly a display of citric american hops. Moderate bitterness, but the balance never wavers. A touch of sweetish yeast in the aftertaste, with plenty of citric hop flavor. Very soft carbonation, just a light tingle on the tongue. Full bodied, with a very creamy cask conditioned mouthfeel. Top shelf. IPA doesn't get much better than this. One of my all time favorites. I find myself craving this more than any other beer when I'm thirsty for a pint. This gets my gold star and red pencilled ""great job!"" with a big circled A+.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Sammy,4.45,"An amazing brew. A redish colour with a retaining head. Pleasant aroma, great choice late afternoon and before dinner as so tasty and inetresting on its own. A wake up call to the senses from the hops. Very popular with my mates. We all will have it again. Will tingle and numb the tongue. Was hoppy but mellower when had a year later on tap at Clark's Ale House.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,JackTheRipper,4.5,"Appearance: Pours a crystal clear reddish amber color. Head disappeared pretty quickly, little lacing.  Smell: I was expecting an overwhelmingly grapefruity smell but was surprised at what I actually smell. Grapefruit, raisins, a little spice. Very nice.  Taste: Nicely bitter, hoppy, finishes with a nice bit of sweetness. Alcohol taste is just right.  Mouthfeel: Very full, not too overpowering, Carbonation is near perfection. Pleasantly warm on the way down.  Drinkability: it's up there, I've not been a fan of this type of beer until now.  I am pretty impressed as I sit here tasting this lovely brew. I can see why it's a top 50 beer. Very nice.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,beerinator,3.75,"Appearance: Ruby, caramel ruby. Offwhite retentive head with nice fine bubbles.  Aroma: Malty, with caramel breadyness. Citrusy fruit present in the nose. Very nice aroma for those who call themselves hopheads.  Taste: Fairly malty upfront. Hop flavor isn't as strong as would be expected from the aroma. Very clean beer. Hops and bitterness linger a bit but the mouthfeel and aftertaste blend together well.  Notes: Good beer. This particular bottle may have been mistreated, or a bit old. The hops just didn't seem to have the punch that I remember. I'll chalk this one up to be reviewed again at a later date.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,yankeeheel,4.35,"You can tell this is a different dog right from the pour.  When I think hoppy I have a pre-concieved notion of a yellow or plae ale. Not so here. Pours a beautiful amber with an appropraitely amber head. Lots of retention and lacing.  There is a distinct soapy-hoppy aroma that greets the nose but it doesn't scream out hops like I expected. The taste is what a well balanced beer is all about. There is a fair amount of caramel malt up front with a bold toasty middle with the hops waiting till the end to reveal themselves. Then they come in droves. It's almost a delayed hop bomb. They are slightly bitter, but not unpleasent.  The best hoppy beer I've had to date.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,twilight,4.62,"Awww... A cute little hopdevil on the bottle. It's nice, and adds some fun to the seriousness of the beer. It pours a cloudy golden orange colour with a head that doesn't last at all. The smell- oh, the smell- it's like sticking your nose into a packet of hops when you homebrew. And that reminds me of the beauty of hops. I suppose I'll have to be a hopdevil worshipper for this one based solely on the smell. The taste is excellent, smooth and malty, and continuing to the bitterness of the hops while leaving a balanced, yet hoppily bitter, aftertaste in the mouth. It almost has citrusy overtones during the intense hop rush. I hadn't realized this was 6.7 ABV otherwise I'd have bought another for tonight. There's always tomorrow. With the grand rush of hops, I hoppily look forward to more intense IPA's.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,BuckeyeNation,4.13,"Slightly cloudy orange-amber, more orange than most. The head is pale orange to light toffee in color and leaves wisps and small sheets of sticky lace as it falls. The nose is hoppy, but it isn't one-dimensional. Malt is appreciated, as is a certain spiciness.  The flavor is of hops and caramel malt. The hops win comfortably, but there's more malt than I'm used to in an American IPA. Those of you who like a strong malt presence or a balanced character in your IPAs will love it. Citrus fruit is front and center, especially grapefruit and orange peel.  The body/mouthfeel is medium-full and is nicely done. It's very slightly dry on the finish, which is where the hops assert themselves to an even greater extent.  Even though I like my IPAs to be slanted a little more toward the hoppy end of the scale, this is a very good beer and is one that I'll buy whenever I have the opportunity. Love the HopDevil on the label.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,necoadam,4.3,"Nice color on this beer as it poured out a orange-goldish color with a head that quickly disappeared, but nice lacing all the way to the very end. Smell..whoa, they don't call it hopdevil ale for nothing. Tons of hops in the smell with some citrus which smells very refreshing. Taste was awesome. Hops attack your tongue then finishs off with some citrus at the end. Extremely refreshing. Finishes dry. This is a IPA done very well. Goes down smooth which leads to a high drinkability. I would recommend this beer for sure!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,merlin48,4.42,"12 oz bottle with ""enjoy by Mar 11 04"" on the label. Pours a beautiful tangerine amber with a medium light beige head that quickly dissolves into a slick, with lacing all over the glass. The nose, ah yes, the nose. Plenty of hops here...pine, grapefruit, hay, spices, and some mountain meadow florals as well. Mouthfeel is chewy, and won't hardly let go. Thick and coating, with lots of bittering hops and medium carbonation. Hops dominate the flavor profile, but you can taste the malts underneath. This is one tasty IPA! Flavor just keeps improving toward room temperature, but it's all about the hops. Finishes dry and bitter, with a long and complex aftertaste. This is probably the best ""standard"" IPA I've ever tasted. Impressive ale!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,CRJMellor,3.68,"Pours a beautiful amber nectar color with some reddish tints. small head developed with vigours pouring, produced nice lace. Very pleasnt hop aroma, oily, resiny, citrusy hops. Flavors was bitter as to be expected but along with pale malt on the back end. I felt a slightly gritty aftertaste, almost as if some gypsum was present. Decent beer but jus didn't have much balance for me to call great. I'd like to try it at the brewery to get a better idea of how it is fresh.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,WesWes,4.42,The beer pours an amber color with a frothy off-white head. The aroma is of hops galore. It has a cross between citrousy and floral hops; a very pleasant odor. The taste is outstanding. It has a good balance of pale and crystal malts which give it a nice mild maltiness. There is a wide array of hop additions here which adds to the flavor and it's uniqueness. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation; an outstanding beer for hop lovers. This is a great drinking beer with lots of hops.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,HiroProtagonist,4.21,"This one was hazy with a lovely raspberry-red orange hue. The aroma was resiny hops and more hops, I knew this would be the kind of IPA I would like. Tastes of extreme hops with orange and lime citrus notes...a bit astringent. Sounds a bit harsh but it is quite delicious. Its mouthfeel was the weakpoint, a medium body but a bit thin for me for the style. The crispness was pleasant though. Overall a really beautiful and yummy hoppy IPA that I like to keep in stock in my fridge.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,TastyTaste,4.78,"Very intimidating. I have within the past year developed a taste for hoppy beers, that taste turned to love. This beer is over the top hoppy, I can't imagine what my tongue would've done when I first started drinking beer. This is very strongly flavored of grapefruit, pine, and spice, with very little malt (it may just be buried under all of those hops). Be ready for an experience if you are new to IPA's.  P.S. I had another one of these at cellar temp (my other samle was fridge temp). It definitely has an even stronger flavor, if that was possible. Definitely tastes more juicy and spicy. Try both,",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,putnam,4.23,"This is easily the most rated beer (340 notes posted here as of this date) that I've ever reviewed. Frothy, elegant buttercream-colored mousse settles over the viscous, reddish liquid. Noses full of candied citrus-flavored Washington hops appear first, then, after tasting, they produce a tarry, resinny bitterness equivalent to licorice or charred pine sap. Heady, perfumy, sweaty hop aromatics define the experience from the nostrils up. There's texture here, but, despite its grand scale and breadth, it is one that remains powdery in its slate/iron bitterness. One version of a far-too ubiquitous style I'm sorry to report.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,DrewBeechum,3.92,Reviewed from a 12 ounce brown bottle with no freshness date.  Beer pours bright orange with minimal haze with a large white fluffy head that sticks in the glass.  Aroma is spicy with sandalwood and mildly citrus hop with a dustiness in the end.  Flavor is sharp and resinous with a pleasant approach of hops that is balanced with a medium weight body that tastes like a good handful of biscuit malt and lends a large residual sweetness that is swept back off the tongue by a carbonation enhanced hop. Finish has a sharp acidic touch on the front of the tongue with a dollop of honey on the end of the tongue.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Gump,4.35,"Hop Devil. I braced myself for the worst. I didn't know what to expect, but with ""Devil"" in the name I was prepared for extreme spice and bitterness. It wasn't like that at all.  Instead I experienced a wonderfully hoppy, sweet tasting IPA that was not bitter.  It poured a mildy cloudy, dark honey color with a thick head and lingering lace. Sweet smell of crisp cirtus, like green apple  Over time, this beer made my mouth dry. Maybe I'm not drinking enough :)",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,rajendra82,4.32,"Poured out a clear amber to orange with a look of sweet tea, The moderate sized head settled down to a thin collar of bubbles that left a good amount of clingy lace. The aroma is fairly mild piney hops with citrus notes. Tasted sweet and crisp with a slick oily mouthfeel. The finish is dry with a more distinct hop aftertaste. Very tasty and drinkable, but not bold enough to justify the name HopDevil . Very nicely balcanced, and would serve as a great introduction to microbrews for someone perpetually sucking on macro swill. Thanks resirob for sending it down south as a part of the 2003 Holiday beer exchange. If I could get this locally, I'd drink it fairly regularly.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Naerhu,4,"Orange amber with a thin tan off white head. Herbal hoppy medicinal aroma The flavor much more reserved than what I was expecting, but still wonderfully hoppy. Cola, earth with banana nut bread and orange rind bitterness. Thick and smooth and lightly carbonated.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,FranklinPCombs,4.05,"This is a wonderful brew. Out of the bottle, it poured a mellow honey color, with very little head. It receded into a patchy foam, and there was very little lace. The smell was that of hops burried beneath fruity aromas, almost grapee. There is a hint of pine and malt flavors in the smell also. The mouthfeel is smooth on the front of the tongue, but by the time it reaches the back of your throat it is very sharp. This brew truely plays on your palate. Feeling this go down my throat was one of my favorite parts of drinking it. The broad full flavor of hops is the first flavor that is recognizable after the mouthfeel wears off and the flavors take over. A taste mildly resembling pine sap is also present, probaly from the hops. A slight fruity undertone is there, reminiscent of that of the smell. The whole body of flavor mellows into a slighty burnt, woodsy aftertaste which persists long after the beer is done. This is one fine brew, especially when enjoyed in good company.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,woemad,4.29,"Bottle purchased at Jim's Homebrew in Spokane for $2.07. Slightly weathered looking label, which commands the drinker to ""enjoy by Jan 11 04."" This is the first offering by Victory that I have seen in my area. Perhaps I will find Storm King around here one of these days! Poured a cloudy copper color, with an almost nonexistent white head that dissipated in seconds, though a collar of foam remained. The smell is of robust, floral, spicy hops and sweet malts. The taste is of mildly swet malts and crisp, spicy hops that finish with a very dry character. The balance between the hops and the malt is nice, with the hops taking the dominant role, of course. Nice, oily, moderately creamy mouthfeel. This is a very enjoyable IPA, well balanced, and very drinkable. This would be very nice on a hot day. Right now, in cold Spokane, I am endeavoring to convince myself it is 80 degress with the help of this beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,theozag,4.52,"In a word, I found HopDevil Ale to be nothing short of splendid.  Pours so pristinely that the platinum-blonde heads seems to simpyl appear over the beer without any agitation at all. The brew itself is a milky, medium amber from bottle to stomach. Smells of sweet summer breezes and roasted bitterness. Take it from someone with a weak sense of smell, this one is sure to impress. Starts crisp and smooth, but washes over the tongue with lots of bitter flavor in very short order. A full-bodied brew, HopDevil delivers everything you expect from a great IPA: hops, hops, and more hops (with a bit of caramel and creme flavors thrown in for good measure). Finishes rough, bitter, and dry but more drinkable than the average IPA because it leaves only a pleasant aftertaste and feels good rolling down the throat.  Overall, probably my favorite IPA to date. If you're ever close to the Victory HQ, I suggest you take a detour and pick up a couple of bottles.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Weissenheimer,3.68,"Victory Hop Devil is a slightly hazy beer with the color of a copper pipe that was new a few years ago but is now oxidized. Satisfyingly frothy and bubbly, the medium-sized head quickly begins to dimple. As I drink, it leaves horizontal ridges of lacing on the glass. Although these ridges eventually collapse, quite a bit of the lacing is still there when the glass is finished.  The pleasantly fresh, floral, moderately hoppy scent reminds me of a bouquet of wildflowers - not the really fragrant kind, but the kind most people think of as weeds. It's nicely balanced, and not as redolent of hops as I'd expected.  The initial taste is one of mild spices - again, not what I was expecting. I'm quite surprised to find that it reminds me of the subdued spiciness of Penn Brewery's ""St. Nikolaus Bock"" (listed on BA as St. Nick Bock). Of course the Hop Devil has more hops than the St. Nick, and to its credit the spices and hops are very well balanced. But the bottle says ""menacingly delicious"" and - I'm sorry, but it's far from menacing. In fact I'd call it timid.  The first bottle I tried was past its freshness date, so I held off on this review until I'd gotten hold of an unquestionably fresh bottle. The above applies to both bottles, the below to each bottle in turn.  FIRST BOTTLE: I get the strong impression that this beer suffers from an identity crisis. It wants to be both hoppy and spicy, but it's not memorably spicy and the slightly flat and cloying hop flavor is not snappy enough. The more I drink the more I see it as a wimpy version of Rogue's ""Santa's Private Reserve."" The kicker was that I reviewed it over a nice roast beef sandwich with marinated fresh mozarella, and the sandwich and the beer didn't even know they were in the same room! Shouldn't a beer called ""Hop Devil"" be hoppy enough to pair up satisfyingly with a sandwich?  SECOND BOTTLE: The odd thing was that this one (the definitely fresh one) looked less fresh than the first; it had almost no head. However, with this one I didn't get the sense that the hops had gone flat. It was just hoppy enough to be mildly satisfying in the way in which it played off the sandwich. Still bloody disappointing for a beer called ""Hop Devil"", but... just sayin'.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Gusler,4.29,"Its been almost a year since I sampled this Elixir of Life, and Victory is in my top 10 all time favorite breweries, just so damn many fine beers, and only one mouth.  An unclouded deep amber to copper color as it mellows away in my glass, the head portly in size, semi-creamy in texture and the color a beauteous light tan with the resultant lace a satin like sheet to cover the glass. The rich aroma of the hops, crisp and fresh with a sweet malt backing, what a treat for the senses, start is rich in malt, sweet with the top middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is peacefully acidic, the hops masterful in their spiciness, dry as a desert bone aftertaste that takes the hops till the very last drop, one damn fine brewery, one double damn good beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,DagFishHead,4.59,"Appearance: Slightly hazy bright orange-amber pour. Thick, frothy, lacy light-tan head subsides quickly but not completely. Smell: Flowery intense cascade hops, sweet malt background. Perhaps the standard for American-style IPA nose. Taste: Exceptional balance between hops and malt. Sweet caramel malt followed by acidic hop bitterness concluding with a crisp, dry flower/citrus finish. Mouthfeel: Just slightly thin. Malt is slick and hops are delightfully oily and drying. Carbonation is crisp and helps deliver the hoppy oiliness to the old tastebuds. Drinkability: A super IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,counselor,3.92,"This poured a dark amber, good rocky head, but on further inspection appeared a bit cloudy. The hops hit my nose full on, biting, leafy and citrus. The hops dominate all over, especially on the back end where they linger above the gum line, on the back sides of the throat and inside the cheeks. Not much else going on here except the hops, no esters, no malts. I would prefer a bit more balance in my IPAs. A bit over the top on the IBUs. A really good beer for the times you want to be a hophead.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,ViveLaChouffe,3.88,"Been looking forward to this one all day.  Pours a bright amber with a small frothy tan head. Smell is hops, hops, hops with some sweet malt back there somewhere.  Taste is a bit disappointing but it's good. There's some nice sweet malt that stands up well to a considerable hoppiness. I like the rounded hops flavors, they are all over your mouth and linger forever. But this is not even the hoppiest beer I have had this week and I m not a hop-head. Magic Hat's Blind Faith has more bite than this. Not to mention Smutty's Big A IPA. A very good IPA and more balanced than I expected, I just don't know where this beer gets its reputation as a raving hopmonster.  Nice sticky aftertaste and quite drinkable for me but certainly not the stuff of legend and I can't believe this is a top 25 brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,hungryghost,4.3,"Dark amber pour, good white head that leaves nice lacing remnants. Not surpisingly the first thing I smell is hops, a floral hop, some malt and hops.  Hop Devil most certainly has a healthy hop flavor. I do not think they went overboard with the bittering hops, I have had harsher tastebud killing hop beers. The taste evens out on the way down, there is a sweetness, maybe a malt that counters some of the hop bite. One is left with a little zing on the tongue. I find this to be a very drinkable beer. It went well with the spicey chicken dish I had in between pints.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,GeoffFromSJ,4.12,"This is definitely a hop assault. I'm the type of drinker who likes a good hops/malt balance. I knew going in this wasn't going to be this beer. However, there is a good malt flavor to this beer. The hops completely overwhelm the malt, despite the good malt flavor. I gave a little bonus to the smell rating because you can smell the hops. Probably the best named beer I've come across.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Foxman,4.42,"It pours a rusty red, reminiscent of the cedar water of my beloved Jersey Pines. The aroma grabs the cilia of your nose, and innundates them with the very essence of the citrusy hops. Ah, but the taste, the flavor! The taste picks up where the aroma leaves off, with hops sliding about your palate, but then, as the flavor ebbs, the malt asserts itself a bit, letting you know there is indeed a balance in place. It's medium bodied, coating the mouth nicely, then slipping away, leaving you wanting the next mouthful. And a next one there will be, as many as one, two, three or more bottles might deliver. There can surely be no perfect beer, but this IPA fits right where it needs to be, yet kicks out all the character needed to be a true original in its arena.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,jahred,3.87,"I've read and read about read about how hoppy and wonderful this beer is, and decided it needed to be tried. Pours a ruby red color with a brownish tint and a thin head. Smells instantly of hops? And you could probably guess what it tastes like - hops, hops hops. Initially, as an aftertaste several minutes later, right out of the bottle - and after it warms, too.  But somehow, it went down pretty easy for an IPA (I can't always get thru them so quickly). I barely tasted the alcohol, but 2 beers later I definitely felt the 6.7% ABV.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Stinging & brash, orangey American hops. Very balanced, with an incredibly dry finish. The hops just linger on & on. The trout warms a bit.

345,1005,99bottles,4.7,"Um, where do I start? Mr. T comes to mind because as corny as it sounds, I pity the fool who hasn't had HopDevil. I also pity the fools who have had it in the bottle and think it is anywhere remotely close to being what it is on tap. THEY ARE TWO DIFFERENT BEERS. Well, not by name, but certainly by taste. The bottled one is good. Not great by a long shot. It's too over the top hoppy, which may appeal to some but not to most. It's one big pine tree, with miniminal malt and lackluster everything else. On tap, its a whole different story. Deep red brown, and tan head (not white!). MALT. Sweetness. Citrus. Faint bitterness, but not the atypical ""hop flavor"". Complex malt, that hides the hops initially. One sip and you may say, ""Yum. Tasty. But, what the hell? Who calls this an IP----whoa!!! There they are!!"" The hops are there, and they reveal their character long after the beer has been sipped and swallowed. They dance on your tounge. The malt lingers, and the hops, they bite and frolic and play dirty tricks on you. I love it. It's art. It's ectasty. It's by far the best IPA in the country if not for the skill that is takes to make the flavors interact the way they do. And its not fair to call it the same thing as what Victory is sending out to Joe Yutz in South Dakota. Come to PA for if nothing else, the Eagles and HopDevil on tap.  Cheers!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,mschofield,4.77,"Cloudy bronze, short light tan head Hops and spice in the aroma, the hops follow through to the taste, and the spice is there in a minor amount, citrus and unripened green apple. Medium-full body - the malt isn't overpowered, finishes dry and leaves you looking for the next one. Drinkability - well I love IPAs and I eat grapefruits and lemons like other people would apples, this is about as good as it can get for me. This is good in the bottle as well, but draft is better, smoother and more balanced.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Onceeven,4.15,"Wow. Tried this at my local pub, and was so blown away that I was forced to take a road trip to Downingtown to visit Pennsylvania's beer mecca. This is a hopheads dream. The taste is like a punch to the face, but still absolutely drinkable. I've had quite a few IPAs since but have yet to find one that measures up Victory's brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,dweideman,4.08,"On Tap @ Anam Cara  Medium head, white that was mostly lasting. Slight hop aroma but I was not able to detect much more. Flavor had some surprises, with a slight aprocot and light grapefruit flavor. Sweet to start with a moderate hop flavor finish that was not too strong. Light to medium bodied ale with lively carbonation. Nice representation of the style not too over the top with hop flavor and some really nice tastes on the palate.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,saltydog,4.35,"The day before tasting the bottle for review, I had this cask at Mugs Ale house. I like the beer much better on draft; the lower carbonation smooths the flavors out substantially. Appearance: Reddish orange, clear, thin head, but fairly retentive. Aroma: very subdued due to low carbonation, but hops are apparent. Taste: Big hops, but malt is apparent, not as overpowered as in bottle. Mouthfeel is very smooth at low carbonation. Very drinkable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Gasp100,4.25,"I finally had a chance to pick up a six pack of this brew in one of my local liquor stores. I had just finished the 1/6 keg of Dogfish head's ""Shelter Pale Ale"" (I'll review that next) and I was ready for a change. Since visiting this site I never go out to the beer store without a list of recommendations (too bad the stores in Middletown, DE are limited in selection) from writers here. Anyway, this beer is fantastic. The color was a beautiful bronze hue, a bit cloudy but enticing none the less. I like my beer very cold (on the lower side of the recommended 36 degree's) and this may have an effect on the cloudiness of the brew. After opening the bottle I was greeted with a wave of hops, hops and more hops. Not overpowering but very present. The beer poured with a thin head that disappeared and formed a nice lace down the glass. The taste was awe inspiring... I really mean it. I wasn't through my first glass when I jumpted back on the site and hit the homebrewers section. Then I came back to my senses.... I'll let other craftsman perfect their art for now. The taste had a nice caramel sweetness, much less fruity than the Shelter Pale Ale I was drinking and the hops really cut through and seemed to lighten everything up. It has a kick too, 3 or more and you have the smile on your face (especially when the Yankees are beating the Sox in game 7).  Overall, I love it and I'm proud to say this is a local beer for me --- Downington, PA is not more than an hour away. I WILL take a trip to the Victory Brew Pub as soon as I can.  This is my first review, so go easy. I don't know all the ""catch phrases"" and I don't know how to put into words the particulars just yet, but I'm learning and I love good beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,byrd,4.32,"HopDevil pours with a small light tan head that only gets to about a half an inch at the most and reduces to a thin lace. The color is dark amber, almost copper. As expected (and hoped for) theres a big hop aroma of juicy citrus notes. The aroma isnt quite as biting and grapefruity as some other big IPAs, and it seems a little sweeter from some caramel malts. The body and carbonation are medium. Theres a good malt backbone that starts a little sweet. This brew is very well balanced, and the hops are never overbearing. However, the hops are a little harsher the some other IPAs. This really isnt much of a problem though. Theres a citric bitterness in the finish that lingers for a bit. Very drinkable IPA that I enjoyed immensely. Ive been typically purchasing beers by singles. The flaw in this method is that whenever I try a great brew I dont have anymore to follow.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,soilguy,4.65,"The american IPA has finally reached the pinnacle of its evolution, and its name is Hopdevil. This was my second encounter with the Hopdevil, having visited the brewery in 2001. It was even better than I remembered. A blast of citrusy american hops assaults one upon opening the bottle - definitely some Cascade, and I wouldn't be surprised if some Centennial was lurking in there as well. It pours a dark golden brown with a rich white head. The flavor is the perfect union of sharp hops and crisp maltiness. Naturally, it is out of balance and strongly weighted towards the hops, but the hops do not suppress the other complex flavors in the beer. Any idiot can fill a brew kettle to the top with hops and call it an IPA, but the skill of the brewer is revealed by brewing a beer that satisfies the hopheads and still has loads of malt character. In my opinion, this is one of the top five craft brews that I have tasted.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,BeerResearcher,4.42,"Wow!is this ever a powerfully hopped IPA!!!. It pours an orange-tinged amber/copper with a nice offsetting trim of beige head. A big whiff of fresh floral hop is noticed upon opening. The lightly sweet caramel malt has a toasty background flavor. Big white grapefruit bitterness leaps out as fresh under-ripe oranges and a lightly metallic tang add dimension and snap to the overall hop theme. A mild herbal quality ever so slightly tempers the sharp edginess of this brew, making it high drinkable despite its high alpha- acid content.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,HonestWeightBeer,4.67,"Had it on cask at Sunset in Allston.  Haven't had the bottled version in a while (and liked that quite a bit), but this beer is absolutely fantastic in a cask.  Poured a clear, deep golden orange, with little to no head. The scent was remarkable, hop resins, pine, citric acid, slight alcohol.  Taste was phenomenal. hoppy, but not overdone or out of balance, resinous, slightly astringent, a slight warming from the alcohol. Really, I cannot say enough good things about this.. Medium bodied, smooth, refreshing, a joy.  Drinkability, let's just say they could park my barstool next to the beer engine and I would pour this one all night. Get your ass to Sunset, even if you hate the place, because I don't know of anywhere else in boston to get this amazing beer..I'm getting thirsty just typing about it..",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,RoyalT,4.53,"Appearance  This was a work of art. The body was a gorgeous, deep dark orange with a monster head that rose and rose. I couldnt stop staring at the lacing that it left when it finally went down.  Smell  Extremely complex hop profile. I think just about every type of hop must be represented in this ale. Theres also a subtle yet distinct malt balance, but this one is all about the beautiful hop scent.  Taste  The complex aromas found there way into the taste. The hops were very well balanced, and made this one a pleasure to consume. The malt backbone was enough to balance, but this one certainly is all about the hops.  Mouthfeel  Medium-bodied with a bit of carbonation. The exceptional balance of this ale made it feel terrific in the mouth.  Drinkability  This was a terrific IPA that was exceptionally smooth, tasty, and exciting all at the same time.  Update – I thought I’d revisit my review 10 years later. The incredible mouthfeel stands out to me again. It is so smooth it just disappears from the glass. This one will never grow old.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,CBFanWish,4.03,"This was a pretty good brew. Not my favorite, but pretty good, none the less. It had a nice orange color pushing a well lacing head. The smell was that of flowers. I don't know why, that's what I got. A hoppy taste, but at the same time it was very malty. Kind of its own contradiction. There was more than enough in it to balance things out. It was a good beer. I like it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,rkhaze,4.7,"Good Moogly-Googly! What a beer! Poured an amber-orange color with a beautiful head and good lacing. Very hoppy-floral aroma. Good rich mouthfeel. The taste was complex with a vicious malt vs. hop battle waging with the ultimate winner being your tastebuds. I don't think I've had a more balanced IPA. Very drinkable, highly recommended and certainly worth seeking out.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Gavage,4.67,"Pours a nice orange / amber color, with a thick head. The floral nose is extremely prevelant, with hints of sweetness. Extremely well balanced, the malt and hops dance together on the tongue, producing a crisp bitterness that slowly fades after swallowing. The glass develops nice lacework as the liquid is emptied. Extremely smooth and drinkable. The consistancy of this product over the past few years has been incredible, and this is an IPA others should try to emulate.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,silks636,4.25,"Poured from a 12 oz. brown bottle. Freshness date stamped on label.  Deep ruddy amber color. Slight haze. Pours a thick, sticky off-white head that leaves considerable sheets of lacing. Moderate head retention. Just a quick swirl and the aroma tells you that this beer means business. Heavy duty hop nose with sweet floral and pine hints. A slight bready malt scent is detectable as well. Being prepared for a full-on frontal hops assault, I was pleasantly surprised when tasting this beer. The hops are the star of the show here, but they are not at all overwhelming. Not what I would call balanced, but not ridiculously mouth smacking bitter either.  Starts off smooth with a touch of malt before the hops kick in. The hops then give a sharp initial sting, but turn to a more subtle melange of flavors. Citrusy and earthy tastes over a light toasted malt, which surprisingly doesnt get buried by the hops. The finish is sweet and fruity with a lingering aftertaste. Mouthfeel is slightly slick with light carbonation.  This one takes no prisioners and is crafted to damn near perfection. HopDevil is very drinkable and a first rate representation of the style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,beerguy101,4.1,"Orange gold color. Medium head. Aroma is floral hops and slight malts. A medium bodied IPA. It's also fairly malty for an IPA. Yet the malt sweetness is balanced by the nicely spicy hops. This is not one of those in-your-face West Coast IPA, yet it's still retains that nice IPA character. A very nice smooth balance between the malts and hops. Nice IPA, very drinkable. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Boilermaker88,4.08,"Okay, knowing that IPA's are not my favorite style of beer (actually, pretty far from it) and I really don't care for over-the-top hop-bomb brews, I still took it upon myself to give a beer named ""HopDevil"" a go. HopDevil poured a livid orangish amber color with a lively apricot-tinged off-white head that endured quite a while and left nice rings of lace. Smell was pretty much what I expected: citrus and piney hoppiness. However, it wasn't off the chart and had a mild caramel toffee note to counterbalance things. Taste was surprising for me. I got the expected charge of grapefruit and pine but intermingled was a mild sweet fruitiness and toffee flavor that really made this a hit for me. Feel was medium-bodied, smooth, and pretty dry. I found HopDevil to be a pleasant surprise. While distinctly hoppy, Victory did a nice job of keeping things from getting totally out of control. While IPA's may not be my favorite style, HopDevil certainly is a fine contribution. A well crafted beer I'd actually like to get again, preferably on tap if I can find it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,AbePhroman,4.72,A creamy head covers the dark amber color of this brew. It smells strong of hops and tastes the same. A bitter brew but not as much as other IPAs. This American IPA is probably one of the best I tasted. It is pretty awesome and my favorite Victory brew. 6.7% is a good amount of alcohol and will surely be enjoyable.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Gueuzedude,4.32,"This beer has a creamy beige head, that helps to show off a nice deep amber color. An aroma of floral hops. Hoppy tasting with notes of lychee, definitely American hops in this one. There is loads of hop flavor in this one, along with a pleasing bitterness. This beer was not as bitter as I was expecting, but it is very well balanced with a subdued maltiness.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,ManekiNeko,4.42,"Served chilled in a pint glass. Best by date of Jan 2, 2004.  Appearance: Clear copper colored liquid topped by an meager off-white head. Little retention and OK lacing. A little too dark for an IPA.  Smell: A lovely bouquet of hoppiness. Great balance of spruce and grapefruit aromas. Toffee lurks in the background, waiting to greet you.  Taste: Sweet caramel malts in a lovefest with bitter hops. Sharing is indeed caring as they morph quite nicely into each other. Don't all IPA's gots to be hop monstahs!  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, but not all that filling. Just right.  Drinkability: Great session beer, not so hopped out as to preclude an extended session. Glad this sucker is relatively local and brewed year round.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,rastaman,3.12,"Really sticky. Caramelly malts. Sweet hoppyness, with a dry hoppy finish??? piney lychee hops (and, yes, sticky), sharp and unbalanced hoppyness, i can't believe how boring it ended up being, considering the amount of flavour in it. Lots of flavour though, pretty tasty.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,moulefrite,4.4,"This is one smooth IPA! In general I'm not a huge fan of the style. I find most-especially domestic IPA's to be simply too overdone. This offering however is real easy to like. From the moment the beer hits the glass it impresses. deep burnt orange/copper in color, the beer sports a mouth wateringly attractive creamy,beige head. Aromas while certainly hoppy are balanced nicely by an almost sweet, malty biscuit component. Flavors are as well hoppy, yet again the bitterness is counterbalanced by a toasty, delicious roasted, maltiness. Especially nice is this beers mouthfeel-lovely, round, full bodied, and very creamy in texture. This is a stand out beverage even for those who don't go crazy for the style. By the way, the finish on this beer lasts a good solid minute!!!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,chaduvel,4.28,"My 50th review. On tap at Cambridge Common. This is one hell of a beer. Appearance: Nice copper color, with a creamy head that follows the sides of the glass all the way down, stays around to mock me. Smell: Hops, citrus hops, grapefruit hops. Did I mention hops..? Taste: Holy damn. This beer is trying to kick my ass. Intense hop juice flavors, but the malt makes this a full-bodied beer, they try to show their presence, but get thoroughly schooled by the hops. Some field green flavors, but dominated by the sweet hops. Mouthfeel: Full and satisfying. Drinkability: I can't take much more of this. Very appropriately named beer. An amazing offering if you love hops. I'm slowly coming around.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,cerevisiaephilus,4.57,"I think this is my favorite way to enjoy HopDevil. I had it up at Zeno's in State College, PA. The lack of carbonation makes this particular devil particularly smooth and definately TOO easy to imbibe. Excellent hoppy beer. Lots of american hops, citrusy etc. But the malt profile of this beer is also remarkable. A very complex malt flavor that adds to this beers overall pleasantness.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,jtfest,4.22,"Appearance: Pours a darkish, kind of burnt amber color with a small off-white head.  Smell: Hops. Period. It smells like youre holding a wonderful bouquet of liquid hops.  Taste: Smoothly bitter with a hoppy finish that blooms on the palate.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied, creamy with a light fizz.  Drinkability: I have a hard time answering this one. HopDevil is a great beer, but almost overwhelming. I dont know if I could see myself pounding down a bunch of them.  Comments: This is my kind of IPA. I love Hops, and the Devil delivers! I wish they brewed this stuff when I lived in Philly. Thankfully, its findable out here in Oregon. I plan to keep a few bottles in my stash.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,ithacabaron,4.25,"Similar to my review of this beer from the bottle. The major difference is in the aroma, which blooms here to even higher heights.  I promise you, you could smell this beer from across the bar room.  Pair it with some savory food -- preferably something greasy. You won't be disappointed.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,beernbbq,4.85,"Had to review again to once again be in amazement of this beer. It is so straightforward and simply put together, yet produces an amazing array of tastes and textures. No sugars or spices, no special fermentations, just excellent rich malts flavored with the whole flower hops. Sometimes this beer comes on like an IPA, sometimes like an Alt, with a little bit of Stout thrown in for good measure. At about a buck a beer from most PA distributors, this most reviewed of beers proves that even though it is not number 1, you give up nothing for being the most popular.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,mikeys01,3.97,"I tried the Hopdevil on draft tonight, after having had it bottled before; I must say it's quite different on draft. Color is a nice deep orange, with a little tan head. The hop aroma didn't seem quite as aggressive as the bottled version, but is very present, along with a nice malt and bready balance. Blended into the aroma are hints of pine and citrus, but well subdued. Taste is very hoppy, but not unbalanced, reasonably sweet with a hint of oak and piney goodness. The malt is more noticeable than the bottled version as well, making the draft a well rounded brew. Goes down very smooth with a sweet, slight hop-bittterness left on the back of the tongue.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Dmann,4.18,"This beer came highly recommended and it is definantly a good brew! It poured a dark copper color with a good slightly off white head that left a good lace down to the end of the glass. The smell was of hops, spice, and a hint of grapefruit I believe. The taste was not as dry as I was expecting, but it was still excelent. The hops hit in the very beginning but then they were taken over by the wonderful spicy taste. Very unique. The mouthfeel was very smoothe and the beer went down very nicely. Although I do not think this stands up to the likes of the Stone IPA, this is a very very good beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Redrover,4.12,"Beer pours a nice bronze with an off-white head. Very attractive beer here!  Nice aroma. Big dose of hop goodness. Also get an underlying grapefruit type smell.  Beer has a bracing hop bite. Bitter in the best possible way. Clear use of quality ingredients. This is a big hop beer and I think could use a little more malt for some balance. This is not a huge complaint as this beer is very good.  Drinkabilty is decent, but suffers slightly from the lack of balance. Nice carbonation and mouthfeell, just right for style.  I like this beer, but it is not for someone who does not embrace the hop loving culture of these big beers. I will buy this one again!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Quaffer,4.05,"Appearance: This was an amber-red beer with a very heavy bead. A light-tan, three-finger head rose up on the pour. It was kind of rocky and settled down slowly, leaving a ton of sticky lace on the glass. A thin cap of foam remained the entire time, though that wasn't very long with this beer. :-)  Smell: The aroma was nicely balanced, being a wonderful combination of herbal hops and sweet malt. I was really expecting the hops to dominate. While it was very prominent, it was not overwhelming. A few other lighter aromas were also present, such as grass, caramel, and a spice that I couldn't quite put my finger on. As the beer warmed up, a bready, roasted malt smell really developed.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a lot of bite. Not as smooth as I would have liked it to have been.  Taste: Upfront, there was a good dose of sweet malt and caramel, with just a hint of roasted malt. Then, after I had a little time to enjoy that, a large does of hops kicked in that totally dominated the flavor. It was kind of spicy, but mostly herbal, taking on an almost menthol-like quality in the aftertaste. I could almost feel it in my sinuses, like the way you feel horseradish in your nose when you eat it. This is not to say that the hops was too strong (yeah, like that's possible), but it definitely made its presence known. Also on the aftertaste was light, buttery sweetness.  This was a great beer. I am glad that I finally got the chance to give it a try.  Thanks Jarod!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,indiapaleale,4.45,"I went to the horse's mouth for this one. Straight from the tap at the brewery. Its just a great IPA, nothing fancy, nothing too crazy. It looks like an IPA, light in color and citrusy in smell. It is very crisp and has a bit of a bite on your tongue. What it isn't is one of those watery IPA's that is lacking the hopitude to make it true. Its great from a bottle as well. My advice is to go to the brewery and get a growler, they have the old fashioned metal handle ones!!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Kongquistador,4.35,"Served a little warmer than I intended, but here goes.  This poured with a nice thick head, very firm, and tiny bubbles. Head was somewhere between off-white and tan. The beer itself is a nice copper color, more reddish toward the center, and a nice amber around the edges. The lace persists throughout the drink, but loses strength toward the end. It is primarily a very fine bubble lace, with some deposits to the sides. The aroma is all hops as far as I can tell, with no hint of malts coming through. It is slightly spicy, but it took me awhile to notice that. As the beer warms, I am beginning to get a faint hint of some malts, but nothing distinct.  The first taste is primarily the sweeter hops, although even up front a but of the bittering comes through. Not at all unpleasant though. The middle has some malt flavoring, mainly caramel, with maybe a slight grassy hint to the brew as well. The finish, as one might expect, is thoroughly dominated by the bitter hops, and the flavor lingers like a girl-friend that won't go away... but in a good way. Overall, this is very well balanced, albeit toward the hops. But then, you knew that was coming. The presence of some malt renders this a very, very drinkable beer.  Can't complain to much about drikability or mouthfeel. Carbonation is moderate, and helps to keep from feeling as though the mouth has been coated in hop oil. The higher alcohol means that this isn't to be fooled with, but it can be consumed enjoyably in quantity.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Globetrotter,4.62,"Finally, an IPA. Sure can't find any here in Russia, so jumped at the chance when friends offered to bring some from the U.S. HopDevil and I are old friends who haven't had the pleasure of each other's company for quite a while. This bottle advised me to enjoy its contents by 11/20/03. No danger of waiting that long. It was empty before 8/17/03.  Poured a gorgeous clear dark copper hue with a medium sized tan head that lingered a bit and held some contour. It also produced some lace, but not enough for my taste. The nose was perfect: beautifully flowery, with hops hitting every corner of each nostril. This nose perfectly telegraphed the coming taste. The mouth was light and prickly, with the flowery sweetness one expects from this much hops. The taste starts sweetish, flowery and hoppy. Then the hops really kick in - almost chewy with grain, leaving a very nice, strong but not agressive bitterness. The aftertaste maintained this flowery bitterness at the back of the jaw and the top of the throat. Smooth, refreshing and wonderful.  I shared the bottle with my brother-in-law from Kazakhstan. He'd never had an IPA before, nor anything else that could even remotely be described as hoppy. His comment: ""this is what beer should taste like."" Amen.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,canoehornpoint,4,"Pours a nice amber with an off white thick head that sticks to the sides well. Has a good spicy floral aroma. Starts with a quick jolt of spicy hop bite that works it way into a sweet maltiness and finishes out with a hop bite that just keeps going. This beer drinks well.  On a personal note, I would prefer a bit more bitterness. The spiciness is good but i prefer a bit more citrus flavor to round it out.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,leeenglewood,4.42,On tap this beer is hoppier then out of the bottle. Copper with a creamy white head that smells earthy and hoppy. Tastes initially extremely hoppy but as it flows across your tongue you get nice kick of malt goodness. Hops are the overwhelming flavor with a slight warmth from the alcohol in your stomach but its barely noticeable. Nice thirst quencher and is also highly drinkable do to its unique but not overwhelming flavor.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Rumrunner,4.57,"12oz. bottle.  For the hop heads. I just love this IPA. Problem. I only found it at Hi-Times in Costa Mesa. I have not seen it in L.A. or Santa Monica yet. Depressed.  Pours a great copper color. Clear and bubbly. Head was minor and not much lacing. Scents were strong with pepper, spices, hops and a malt for balance.  Flavors reflect the scents in many ways. A lot of spices incuding pepper, rind and a grassy bite. The hops are bitter and heavy but not fruity. There is an earthy quality and this IPA is bitter. The malts are present but they do not provide much balance. Some molasses but nothing to invade the presence of hops. They dominate this IPA.  It feels great and there is a smooth drinkability to this one. It goes down real easy. I want to try this from a cask some day. I bet it is just out of this world.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Stopper,4.72,"This pours a nice, bright amber highlighted by hints of red with a moderate pale tan head that dissipates very slowly. In the nose there is a great balance of robust malt with a bit of caramel and bright, barely citrusy, hop aroma. The first sip hits you with a well-bodied base of the same, somewhat caramelly, maltiness that was in the aroma and a perfectly balanced medium bitterness. As the malt fades, the bitterness remains and a great hop flavor emerges, which is a touch spicy for a moment, then fading to a mostly round noble-type flavor with only a barely-perceptible spiciness. And the hop flavor seems to go on and on...  This is a very refreshing, wonderfully hopped beer, with a great malt base and piles of flavor and interest. It's a great beer for nearly any occasion or mood, and enough amazing taste and character to come back to again and again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,marburg,4.02,"Shock and awe: That's what just happened to my palate.  I'm glad I didn't plan on drinking anything after this; it's flavor and residual bitterness lingers with an incredible intensity 20 minutes after consuming it.  Color is full of warm tones. Orange, red, copper hues shift in the light. Breakfast assortment of aromas. Honey, grapefruit, citrus, herbal tea. Honey-sweet malt backbone gets slapped aside quickly by an overwhelmingly bitter hop presence. This beer represents the bitter equivalent of some of the more extremely sour Belgian brews. Pleasingly, this brew's immense hop presence doesn't completely destroy its subtle aromas. A little too far out there on the hop spectrum to really be considered exceedingly drinkable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,taez555,4.35,"This beer poured a very thick orange/tannish head with a very clear reddish amber body.  The nose was pure hops, yet not as overpowering as you might expect. Some slight malt, but mostly a very subdued citrus, spice, slight peppery hop smell.  The taste started very malty. Full bodied. Some caramel malt flavor. Quickly followed by this big, very tight, citrus/black pepper hop burst. A nice intence but balanced bitterness. Then it ended on a very slow smooth bitter hop finish.  What I found really interesting about this beer is how perfectly balanced it is. It's not your typical over hopped, floral, american IPA. It's overlly hopped and in your face, but the hop flavors are mellowed just enough to balance it and make it very drinkable. Not as if you're drinking a beer soaked in hops. On top of that the hops are very tight and sharp. Almost like Sierra Nevada Bigfoot, but for everyday drinking. A very nice beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,bmills1608,4.49,"Wha-wha-WHAT!!!  First and foremost, cask conditioned HopDevil is totally different then on tap or the bottle. It's almost like a totally different beer, wow, I was very surprised at how this tasted.  Served in your typical, chunky American pint glass. A rather murky light brown color. The bar was dim, so judging the color was a bit tough, but cloudy and murky for sure. Head was off white, frothy, thick and creamy as hell. Sheets of lace were left on the sides of the glass as I drank.  Taking a smell, I was initially confused, ""where did the cascades go?"". Aromas of sweet bread, tons of herbal smelling hops, rich, almost fudge-like malts and exotic fruits exploded from the glass. The floral/herbal aroma is what I think surprised me more then anything. No citrus/grapefruit this time around.  Taste was above all - fruity. Melons, oranges and herbs danced around on a thick and solid foundation of malt. The malt character, like the other versions of HopDevil, had a big say in the cask version as well, but this time, it was even heavier handed, slapping the hops around and making it clear to them that in this version, malt rules, but only by a nose. The hop character is there, just more mellowed and less brittle and crunchy hard as in other versions. The citrus hammer that bottled or tap versions of HopDevil usually wield, was just not here. The finish was herbal and smoldering with soft bitterness. Mouthfeel was rich, smooth and fantastic, so creamy and rich.  Overall impression - This just goes to show you the huge difference cask conditioning can make in a beer. This beer was young and ALIVE. Fantastic.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,ngandhi,4,"Very solid pale ale. The pour is decent, leaves enough head to sip through for a while -- nothing spectacular. A nice, rich amber brown body. What you would expect from a pale ale, but well done anyway.  The nose is this beer's best trait. It perfectly resembles the taste of the beer. I won't go into the nose in detail, just assume that everything I say I taste, I smell. A noteworthy achievement.  Taste/Drinkability: Very hoppy, but not difficult. The IPA that got me loving IPAs was Three Floyd's Dreadnaught, but many complain of its power. Though I like that about Dreadnaught, I can see why some would find it off-putting. HopDevil lacks that devestation. This is much easier to drink on a regular basis. The grapefruit hop kick dries out as expected on the back of the tongue (and STAYS there), but also gives way to a very mild, easy to miss estery sweetness. Also some black pepper.  I like what the malts are doing here. Yes, they are difficult to detect because of the necessary hop focus, but they add a lightly creamy body with just a pinch of sugars. Combined with the yeasts and what can only be assumed as expert brewing techniques, a light flower taste comes out from deep in the background -- natural and not perfumey, it's a great touch. Overall, tangy, but very manageable.  This is a true pale ale. Three Floyd's fans could especially appreciate it. Though strong in flavor, as IPAs are, it's complex and layered.  HopDevil is a no fuss pale ale and, because of that, I will keep it on hand. I wish I could rate it higher. It is what it is. Unpretentious and, so, quite appealing. If there is such a thing as a session IPA, this is it. Alcohol's just low enough, barely I think, to let you kick back a few (at least it seems that way).  Relax, relax. ng",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,kevinl6,4.33,"A fine ale indeed from Victory. This one pours a combo Golden/amber/orange color with an almost 1 finger deep silky head. A very pleasing brew to the eye. Smell is nice also: hoppy (of course), fruity....citric? Taste is very hoppy as well, with a blend of fruit, a nice combination of flavor. Mouthfeel is very soothing for an ale, it is pleasant on the palate. A very drinkable beer, I want another...and another....and another!!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Brent,4.32,"After wanting to try this much acclaimed beer for quite some time, I was delighted to finally run across a bottle. Had I first sampled this a few years ago in my pre-hophead days, I'm sure I would have been blown away. But, having been amused and abused by such hop tonics as Stone Ruination, Dogfish 90 min. and Rogue I2PA, I met this beer on a level playing field.  Cascades juice? Not quite, but not far away. Big malt backbone carried the hops load quite well. My first impression was Sierra Nevada Pale Ale on steroids. The hops flirt with harsh acidity, but manage to pull back just enough. Certainly a top-flight APA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,bierman2000,3.7,The malty hoppy IPA that keeps you begging for more. Not being a hophead this is actually an ale that I can drink a full glass of without tossing. The amber/copper color as well as the floral head and nose make for a stunning bouquet. Taste is well balanced and very enjoyable.. especially if you love hops.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Ahhdball,4,"Great amber color and a full one inch head with staying power that lasted most of the glass. Spicy hops with small hints of citrus in the aroma. The taste was excellent, I haven't had many IPA's but if this represents the style, wow. Bitter but perfect as it goes down, slightly malty with the hops coming on strong about 90% of the way through the drink. Very drinkable, I will have this again and hopefully soon!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,jcalabre,4.35,"Originally sampled many moons ago. I am writing this review from my notes. This is a world class IPA. In my humble opinion, it is in the same class as Stone's IPA and Kalamazoo Bells Two Heart. It's appearance is a copper body w/ an offwhite head. The nose and flavor are those wonderful citrusy hops. Great brew",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Dogbrick,4.42,This brew is a pretty sanguine amber color with a medium and clingy off-white head. Nice lacing throughout. Aroma is heady floral hops. Medium-bodied and crisp with a near-perfect level of hops in the flavor. There is a hint of citrus (lemon/grapefruit) and grass as well. The finish falls off just a little toward the end but overall this is a very good beer.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,WaltTrombone,4.11,"After my recent scary experience with an over-the-top hop monster (SN Bigfoot 2003), I was a little nervous about trying HopDevil, but I'm glad I did. For me, it's a good summertime beer, lighter than my usual stouts.  It poured an orangey red, with a chunky beige head. The aroma was faint, malt, caramel and hops. The taste was an initial blast of malt and caramel, purged right after with a steamroller's worth of hops. Mild hops, though, not anywhere near as mouth-puckeringly bitter as the previously mentioned Bigfoot. (Still maybe a bit too hoppy for a recent convert from macros. For them, try a Brooklyn IPA, just as good as HopDevil, but not as hoppy. Review coming soon...) As the beer warms, the taste blossoms into bursts of honey, cola, prunes. In retrospect, I've been drinking this too cold, try chilling this for a short while so that it's in between cellar and fridge temps. Mouthfeel was creamy smooth, with just enough carbonation to stand up to the jambalaya I had it with tonight. Finish was mild, just a faint mellow hop tang.  Thanks to Victory for enlightening me to the hoppy truth; hoppiness doesn't have to mean bitter and nasty.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,purplehops,4.67,"On tap HopDevil pours a hazy beautiful copper-orange. The head is off-white and made of very fine bubbles. A nice lace pattern was left on the glass. The aroma is floral and spicy hops with a hint of malt in the far away background. On tap the taste is like that of the bottle version only it seems brighter and more defined on tap. The battle between the bitterness of the hop and the sweetness of the malt is more in balance in the tap version. They are not so much fighting each other as they are working together in a bliss of malty bitterness. The finish is also smoother with a softer carbonation and a more floral hop flavor. Aftertaste leaves you with a smile and a desire for more and more and more. The alcohol seems almost imperceptible. Overall an excellent IPA on tap for the hop head. Malty, medium bodied, and hoppy to perfection.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,freed,3.9,"Like the Pils, a very cool label. It pours a much deeper color - rich amber, and it foams like a wild beer might. The smell obvious; nice and fresh. The darker color is correct in suggesting this is a bigger beer than most IPAs in the malt department. Its got a meaty, rusty flavor very reminicsent of olde style Bitters, almost of an ESB, but a much more pronounced hop flavor. Its a very nice beer, though its vitals make it somewhat difficult to drink another. After finishing, there's almost the same resiny feeling I get after sampling my wort. Sweet and filling.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Mustard,3.93,"Presentation: 12oz. brown bottle with, god bless Victory, a friggin' ""enjoy by"" date. Freaky little portrait of the Swamp Thing on the label.  Appearance: Pours a clear, copperish, burnt-orange hue; fine, one-fingered head; moderate -- albeit scattered -- lacing.  Aroma: Mild notes of malt sweetness smothered under a blanket of citrusy hops.  Taste: A solid, biscuity malt character quickly gives way to a citrusy, floral hop rapist. Aftertaste reverts back to a subdued maltiness.  Mouthfeel: A thick -- almost chewy -- malt body.  Notes: Consumed this after a dark lager and had a good time. Mustard recommends this beer, but cannot support the notion that this is a top twenty-five brew. Good times.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Ianhockey91,4.35,"Wow, what a great brew. The aroma is excellent, and with the first pour i noticed the head had a lot of staying power for an ipa. As expected, the hops hit and they hit hard. The mouthfeel however was a little thinner than expected, but still good. It left a very interesting grapefuit aftertaste in my mouth. All in all a very very drinkable beer, make sure to wait a few between your first and second ones so that you can appriciate it more.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,GeoffRizzo,4.52,"Deep red, mahogeny hue, nice thin, but well retaining head. Massive, sticky lacing, floral hops and fresh flowers noted on the nose, a very clean, inviting aroma. A blast of invigorating hops, some spices and an immediate warming effect, esters noted, although in the background. Some grapefruit noted throughout, medium to full bodied, extremely dry and some bitterness noted towards the finish. Clearly a top shelf IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,avylover,4.48,"Pours a deep red/golden, almost mahogany color with a nice foamy light tan head. Very inviting looking beer, especially during the pour with a tornado of golden carbonation. Smell is florally hoppy right away, then some good citrous hop notes come through and some malt is back there too. This beer has a zingy floral hop flavor throughout, but the nice buttery-bready maltiness in the background sets this brew apart from other IPA's.Very crisp and drinkable despite a relatively thick consistency. The bitterness destroys any syrupy mouthfeel that may have lingered otherwise. A good american IPA that lives up to it's name. Pretty much what an IPA should be IMO",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Boto,4.59,"What a fantastic brew! The beer is a amber (maybe orangish) color, with a quick-dissapating head. The aroma is fantastic. The hops are strong. Fairly good whiff of grapefruit/citrus to it. The taste is equally good. The hops are VERY strong, but there is an exquisite balance to them. They aren't strong for the sake of being strong. Decent amount of body to the beer. I had this with a friend the other night, and his initial reaction was ""WOW"".",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,beergeek279,4.47,"Served at home out of a Victory variety case. Appearance was amber, with a bit of head retention. Smell was heavily hoppish. The taste was well............very hoppy as well. Mouthfeel was very smooth, and perfectly carbonated. Drinkability-wise, this is certainly another I could have all day!  The Victory HopDevil is truly one of the American classics of IPA, and is surely one that I would have around in the future!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Stingray5,4.33,"12oz bottle to be enjoyed by Oct 08 03. Pours a beautiful dark copper with a perfect fluffy white head. Aroma is spicy hops, but with nice toasty malt notes, too. Very full bodied, this IPA delivers the hops. Sniff, hops. Taste, hops. Burp, hops. Just the way I like it. Spicy, bitter, citrus, all the good stuff. Finish is dry hops with a nice sticky sweet malt balance. Slightly reserved at the finish, which is a good thing because it doesn't send me into a hop-induced coma. Victory has managed to take an IPA, hop it to hell and back and still manage to produce a well balanced brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,edchicma,4.88,"Wow! Some IPAs just bite you and are sometimes hard to swallow. This offering has an excellent amber appearance that leaves a clinging lace all the way down the glass. Smell is floral and not overpowering. The taste has a floral quality that is absolute perfection, just enough to add to the character, but not overpowering. The mouthfeeel is outstanding. It goes down easy and leaves a reminder of its hopping in a pleasantly bitter aftertaste. Suprisingly, this brew is very drinakable, even though the ABV is up there. Of all the IPAs I've tried, by far the best.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,sinistersteve,4.63,"I finally got my hands on an IPA that everyone has been raving about. Beverage poured with a wonderfully thick head. Strong clean amber color. Hints of grapefruit tickled my nose. Not much lace sticks around to show off the fact that you had a wonderful beverage. A nice bitter taste to it that is not too over-the-top like some IPA's can be.  Is it good? YES!! Is it one of the best IPA ever?? Not quite, but it sure is in my top 5 list.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,stirgy,4.5,"This was an extra cask that was put on the bar at the Firkinteeth event at the Grey Lodge. Good thing, too since it was fairly early and there were only two casks left out of the original eleven! This version of Hop Devil poured out a murky amber copper color and was topped with a small creamy white head. Beautiful aroma of flowery hops and a nice maltiness. Taste was very creamy. Nice bitterness with the presence of alcohol. Perfect blend once again of malt and hops. Very flavorful. I have had this beer many times in different forms over the years and this was another excellent version.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,RenoZymurgist,3.8,Dark amber color with tan head. Aroma is mild with a sweet citrus that is nice. The flavor is excellent i love the intensity but it is blended well so that it is not too bitter. The mouthfeel is light and belies the higher alcohol content. A nice beer to go with saly or spicy foods and a nice beer to finish off a long day at work.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,philipt,4.14,"This is a must for any hops lovers. Hopdevil is not overwhelmingly hoppy, but is actually well-balanced. Of course the emphasis here is on the hops qualities.  Somewhat dark copper in color with a reasonably sized cream colored head. The aroma is of very fresh hops--citrus, pine, and spicy. Taste is initially malty but very quickly changes to powerful (but not overwhelming) hops.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Elemental,4.09,"This is a pretty big beer. The color is pale amber color like an ESB rather than a IPA. But it has a great aroma of various hops as expected. After pouring there is about 1cm of head that slowly dissapated to a light head. The taste is good with a lot of hops to please the mouth. A well balanced bitterness to match the maltiness of the beer. You can definately tell that this was run through a hopback. Its slightly spicy with a bit of sweetness. Bottoml line: if you like hops and malt (as a BA should), you'll like this beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,BierReise,3.77,Not one of the best IPA's I've had and certainly nothing compared to some of the California IPA's. Poured a amber/copper color with very small head. Head dissipates quickly to almost nothing. Aroma is nice but more like an APA than an IPA. Smooth on the palate and slightly crisp. Flavor is a good balance but in my opinion just an average IPA. Also bottle could use a make-over.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,SheepNutz,4.32,"I had this one in a 12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a reddish-orange with 2 fingers of head and decent lacing. The smell is very subtle, a little citrus tone, not too much of a hops smell present, which is weird for an IPA. The taste is a mix of citrus and spice, with just a bit of hops at the end. Very balanced for an IPA. Doesn't have the hops meanness of a ruination or a 90 minute. The mouthfeel is pretty strong and really smooth. The drinkability is also fair. This sure has some hops to it, but I'm just not sure that it lives up to its name.  Edit: After reviewing another sample, I found that I like this far more than what I scored for. The first bottle might have been a little off. The second time I had it, it was more true to the name and style, very nice.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Mouthwatering nose oh, the invitation is incredible, plenty of piney/citrusy hops plenty of depth but little complexity though. The palate has plenty of piney hops, prickly bitterness, raw citrusy hops undercurrents, leafy, dry. Very minor caramel malt hints, just enough for balance. The impact of the alcohol on the palate (and mind) is ideal. Tremendously dry & bitter finish, rather long too. Moderate carbonation.

345,1005,rugbycritic,5,"This is absolutley one of my unabashed favorites. As a unredemptive hophead, it doesn't get much better (bitter?) than this. A fantastic expression of the brewer's art; an apoplectic melding of malt sweetnes with lupulus bitternes and aroma. The cask conditioned presentation steps this one up into the valhalla of brewing. If you've only had the draught version of this wonderful brew, the cask is just that more so. The lower conditioning level lets the melange of flavors burst forth on the palate, unencumbered by the bubbliness of carbonation.  As you can probably tell, I am a huge fan. This merits the 5 x 5 as indicated above. I really don't think that there is much room for improvement on this one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Hobbz,4.37,"Pour: light rusty-red hue, foggy twinge with a very thin complement of lacing.  Smell: somewhat strong, cutting aroma of caramel malt sweetness (surprising to me for something called Hopdevil); piney hop profile is there, but it doesnt steal the sole of whats present.  Taste: not your typical American IPA, and I really like it that way (nice change of pace)... this beer does not assail your tastebuds solely by over-hopping. i can imagine plenty of fresh hops, yet there is such a malt profile that all comes to taste so swell together and this ups the drinkability scale for me.  Overall: there are other beers i would go to for a hop-fix... yet this beer impresses.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,shirfan,4.42,"This is perhaps the most balanced IPA I've sampled yet. A huge dose of hops to be sure, but an equally powerful malt presence keeps everything in check.  Pours true copper with a fairly retentive off-white head; aroma is rich with citrusy hops and...gingerbread.  Taste is crisp, clean, but full at the same time. Not a trace of my old nemesis, ringwood yeast. Starts with sweet malt, a touch of carmel/ginger comes through. Hops take over in due course, adding a strong, satisfying citrus bite, but never getting into the bitter resin-like realm of over-the-top IPAs. This goes down exceedingly smooth for all the flavors going on, with very little stickyness.  Yet another excellent offering from Victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,NolanGTI,4.88,"This is simply my favorite beer in the world right now. It is so bold but yet devoid of the taste of a contrived gimicky beer, which I have found ot be the case with some hoppy beers. These guys know how to brew a super-hoppy beer, no doubt about it. The aromas and flavors that this beer will fill you with are unparalleled. It is such a clean drink with such a wonderful aftertaste that I frequently find myself craving it.  The color is drop dead gorgeous.... the taste is out of this world.... if I could walk around with this beer in my mouth all day long I would be the happiest man alive, who needs to eat and talk anyway.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,longpondbeerman,4.27,"A refreshing, light, and effervescent IPA, the hopdevil is great for one of those warm late sping evenings. I can almost hear the birds chirping as I pour this dark caramel (with a russet tint) brew. The head disappeared quickly, and I noticed not much lace as it receded. The smell is of rolling hills of hops with a hint of the citrus groves wafting in on a light breeze from over the hill. There's noticeable carbonation, but for this kind of day, it's perfect (I just came in from a five-mile walk). This stuff goes down fast, or maybe it's late May and I'm just plain ready for summer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,aaronh,4.6,"I first tried this beer at the Pennsylvania microbrewery festival, and I was very impressed. I'm a fan of IPA's and this is by far the best I've had. It seems to let some maltiness through, but with a great hop aroma and finish. Trying in bottles soon(got a six in the fridge).  5-18-03  Updated my review to reflect my comparative experiences since my first review, which was my very first review as a BA (originally a 4.95!). It does have a great malty presence on draft, with a very smooth hop profile as well. This is much better on tap, as the bottles develop a bit of a harshness and do not compare to Two Hearted or Stone IPA bottles. Still a very fine beer though that is a regular in my house.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,mjohn27603,4.5,Another rare treat thanks to trbeer's trek to Chicago. I've been curious ever since seeing this one up on the BA charts. Pours copper in color. Smell reminds me of a barley wine. Some caramel and hops aroma. Taste is a surprise. Very malty and subdued hops. I was expecting an all out hops assault. Usually the extreme beers make the list but this one is more balanced. The bitterness doesn't even kick in until 1/3 of the way through the glass. Again more defined by the malty aspects of the beer. A nice beer but I think I prefer the grapefruit of Bell's Two Hearted. Call me provincial 'cause I'm from Michigan. Still a nice beer and I'm greatful for the opportunity to try. Now if I only can get Storm King Stout!,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Riggo,4.62,"A while back, I tried this beer and just felt it was way too hoppy. I was quite surprised then to discover on a recent tasting how balanced this beer really is. What is distinctive about this beer is not really the heavy hops. Plenty of American brewers do that, but few do it while at the same time balancing it out with complex earthy, malty flavors and an amazing depth of character. All the while remaining very drinkable. Outstanding.  Pours an attractive clear, dark copper with a creamy tan head that remains in a thin cap, leaving nice lacing. The nose is alluring and complex: an earthy mixture of wood, smoke, burnt sugar, spicy, leafy hops, melted butter(?), fruit (orange, lemon, raisins, apricots, grapefruit?). On palate, a combination of complexity and balance that is exceptional. On the one hand, earthy flavors of nutty, roasted, smoky malt, buttery toffee, and caramel. At the same time, spicy, leafy, cedary hop bitterness and fruit--grapefruit, lemon, orange. Finish is long, dry, and fruity. Mouthfeel is full and smooth, with just a touch of carbonation. A surpsisingly drinkable brew to have such a big, spicy hop presence. Very rounded-out and deeply earthy. One of the very best American ales. Victory is perhaps the best brewery in the country.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Stubbie1,4.13,"This IPA pours a dark mahogany red. The tan head develops nicely and gives away to a thin lace. The aroma is all hops; hints of citrus and pine float in the air. Nothing overpowering but enough for the name Hop Devil The taste is very nice, again HOPS! However, there is a nice mild sweetness just before the bitter hop finish. This is very enjoyable to drink. There are more than enough hops to enjoy but not enough to burn out the taste buds. For me, this is a very drinkable IPA. I will look forward for the other 5 in my fridge! No wonder it is in the top 50!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

The deep reddish color makes for a very attractive beer in the glass. Both the aroma and taste are as expected, given the beers name---strongly of hops. The very hoppy taste lingers in the mouth and shifts somewhat into a more spicy aftertaste on the tongue. Medium to full bodied, this beer has very good mouthfeel and goes down quite smoothly.

345,1005,MissOrch,4.35,"At first I wanted to say this beer was amber, but it's much a much deeper, darker red. It had a beautiful head with very tiny bubbles, making it look almost like cream. It laced all the way down the slides while drinking and was still there for my last sip. When I was done, the bottom of the glass looked like a doily. Pretty. But then again, by the time I got to the bottom of the glass, everything was looking pretty.  I immediately smelled burnt caramel, like charred smores. My favorite kind. I also noted some hints of citrus, namely lemon, which must have been the hops kicking in. At first taste, it was fresh and crisp. Then I was almost chewing on the malt, even though there was no sediment whatsoever. Finally, just the right amount of tongue-scooting bitterness finished the palate. There were, however, a few sour notes every few sips. This IPA was delicious, drinkable to the last drop and will be hard to beat.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,usualpulp,4.32,"I was fortunate enough to acquire a six pack of this brew from a friend. The beer pours a nice amber color with a medium white head. The smell of the hops is very noticeable, and very inviting. Upon first sip the mouth is overwhelmed by the exploding taste of hops and light sweet malt, which is very pleasing. Once the hops fade, the mouth is left with a spicy flavor. Overall this is one excellent brew, very refreshing and a pleasure to drink; unfortunately I cannot get it where I live. Regardless, this goes on my list of favorites.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,oberon,4.08,"First of the Victory line I have tried and I came away very impressed.Now Iam not a hop-head but this beer has a nice balance to the hoppiness.Poured a real nice rich copper color with a pillowey head,the aroma of hops hits ya from almost a foot away.Taste is herbal hoppy with a nice nutty malt background.Had this at a pub in Blue Bell not far from my new place.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,nomad,4,"This beer was an amber with orange and brown hues, transparent, and with little carbonation. Had an off-white colored head that was foamy and very steady, some lace, and good little tendrils of stain.  Smelled of hops - fresh, flowery, and full - and notes of orange but thin and cleanly so. Taste was of a chewable tasty malt and lickable tasty hops. The hops were a little sour but more bitter; both characteristics were none too strong, though. The body of the flavors created a very toasted and earthy character, with a slight salt flavor that came through after a couple swigs. What I noticed most was how well-rounded this IPA was, as the malt is recognizable and bases the obvious hops, and develops a small fruit taste in the middle of the swallow.  Finish is dry, and I could feel some sort of malt behind it all. A little nutty and burnt taste in there, too. And with a watery mouthfeel this all amounts to a fairly refreshing and mostly balanced IPA, but just a little too earthy for me though.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,dwarbi,4.76,"I had this on cask at Copperfield's. I've had it on tap and in bottle, but the cask blew me away. Beautiful, perfect head. The beer was a reddish copper color. Smelled peppery, but not enough there. Hoppy, too, of course. Tasted very smooth, hoppy, and a teeny tiny bit bitter. Excellent beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,AtLagerHeads,4.28,"Finally did gets me some of the 'Devil. Right up the side of the head! Whew, Baby, this be the real thing. Hop nose just a waftin' on up there, that great clear amber flittin' its tail 'neath a creamy 2 fingers of ivory. The lace she be dropping in, but sliding on down to the body again. Oooo Man. Creamy full body caresses the palate and wakes it with citrusy flavors and flowery accents. Tried to sip; no luck. This be gulpin' good beer. Two thumbs up for the 'Devil.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,WanderingFool,4.83,Being a big fan of hoppy beers I found HopDevil to be one of the best. It's a beautiful clear amber color with a nice thick off white head that slowly dissolves to a sheet on the beer and leaves a good amount of lace on the glass. The aroma is full of flowery esters and citrus smells. Each sip is a hop lovers delight. Hops dominate each sip with their citrus and flowery flavors. Some toasted malt is found in the background to balance out the flavor. A mild bitterness and sticky pallett is left behind.  This is an excellent and very drinkable beer. If you like hops I highly recommend it.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,brewdlyhooked13,4.35,"Barrelhouse Brewfest sample #8. I like the coppery color on this one. It has a BIG orange, hoppy aroma. I figured it to be a blast of bitterness, but it really wasn't just all about the hop. I found the malt and hop balance to be most excellent. I'll need to find some more of this. I've heard it's even better on tap.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,powoo19,4.47,"I have to be honest, I bought the beer for the bottle art. It is very cool. After hours of letting it chill I cracked one. It poured nicely, with a nice rich color. It clung nicely to the glass with each sip. The taste was, as expected, very hoppy, which I have come to enjoy over the years. It leaves a great feel and aftertaste. This is not a session beer in my opinion, but it is very good. Give it a try, you wont be disappointed, unless of course you think Rolling Rock is good, then just stay away!

Nose is dominated by spicy and floral hops with some additional notes of pine oil. Medium to full-bodied with a slick mouthfeel due to all the hop oils. Taste starts off with strong raw hop leaf flavors followed by some notes of sweet malts and a juicy fruitiness followed yet again by strong bitter hop resins and tannins. A marvelous IPA. Thanks to paceyourself for the sample!,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,PatandDavid,4.35,"I had this on cask. More than one. It's great on cask. I've had it numerous times on draft, and loved it's big hoppy-ness, but on cask, all the rough edges are smoothed away and it turns into even more of a session beer.  Beautiful amber color and head when first poured. Like a said, a great session beer, even at 6.7 (althought that's pushing it). You still get a mouth full of hops, but it seems even more balanced at cask and at that temp.  Recommended, especially on cask for a change. This is good stuff.  pat",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,dmarch,4.47,"This is certainly a favorite in this area and was a favorite of mine even before I moved here. Amber color with a head that never seems to diminish. Hops are very noticable in the aroma and the taste. A nice malt character is present, but lets face it, this is a hop-head's beer. This is the type of beer that I'd like to stock up on and always have on-hand.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Smell was of floral hops and malts, they both jump at you. Obviously a taste of hops is going to be in there and then the malts made just as strong a presence as the hops, a slight spicy taste also was in there. Mouthfeel was smooth and easy to drink. Drinkability is devilish in a good way cause this can kick you ass being so easily drinkable.  Cheers",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,jtw5877,4.47,"Pours a nice orangish kind of color with a nice white head sitting on top. Excellent hop aroma, which of course is expected.

The taste is very mild malt heading to a herbal hoppiness. Perhaps I got an older bottle.

345,1005,Darkale,4.38,"Aroma is, of course, flowers and hops. A thick tan head with a mixture of large and small bubbles and great, tenacious lacing. Color is copper-orange, darker perhaps than the usual IPA. Taste is slightly chewy, a wonderful hops snap that is spicy without being distracting, with a backbone of malt. The hops and malt have a wonderful intercourse in this beer -- can I say intercourse? Because the two ingredients love each other, and I love being there with them. Sweet and sour are perfectly mixed. A delight.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Fresh dried floral hops and fruity aroma with an awesome grainy, toasted bakery-like back. This had a really complex aroma with lots of floral hop, some citrus, spice, & grassy grain, super fresh, yum. Tastes like it smells, fresh dried floral hops, with some citrus & spice notes and sneaky bitter, grassy notes as well. But not enough to ruin the solid hop crispy drying finish. Feel has a somewhat creamy medium body and airy dry.

'Enjoy by Mar 17 03' marked clearly on the front side of the bottle.  This IPA poured a clear reddish-amber with a tan foamy head that is retained throughout consumption. The wonderful aroma consists of floral hops, citrus, malt and spice. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and has a creamy texture. HopDevil exhibits the perfect hop balance. Bitter yet not too salty. Excellent biscuity finish that was and unexpected delight. Touch of citrus also. HopDevil is not overly complex, but just a really good IPA.

This IPA poured a hazy, reddish amber color with a creamy, light tan foam that left very nice lace on the glass. The smell came blasting from the bottle the minute the cap was popped: a beautiful, fragrant, floral hop aroma! Some citrus, biscuit, malt, and a hint of spice also in the smell. The taste was almost completely hops (bitter and floral) with only a bit of malt, which is overwhelmed. The mouthfeel was crisp, but slightly chalky. Full bodied, lively carbonation, with a lingering hop flavor. The drinkability was good.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Very fizzy appearance, looks quite carbonated, with a deep orange-amber color.  Smell: Can we say hops? One more time? Smells like a freshly mown hayfield with some malty notes.  Taste: I've been reading about hops online, so I had an urge to drink some IPA. Lo and behold, I decided to pick up this beer. I've got to sayit one more time . . . hops! The carbonation hits hard at first, with each bursting bubble releasing some more hop flavor. Wonderful bitterness that reminds me of the taste of biting into a grapefuit. In the middle there is a sour, tangy taste, and it finishes with a lingering bitterness on hte back of the tongue.   Great IPA. Will return to this one again and again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Maestro,4.42,This beer is truly incredible. The hops are so well balanced even though there are way more than the average IPA. This ale has quite a smooth taste and is very mellow despite its extreme hop characteristics. The nose is very hoppy but the malts sneak through as well as some citrus hints. The taste is very clean but it has a little bite. The head is not too strong but it leaves quite a nice foamy lacing on the glass. There seems to be a slight hint of apple in the middle of the beer. There is substantial carbonation throughout the beer. The malts come out at the finish line making this orange/red ale quite a find.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Dantes,4.1,"Package:12 oz. brown longneck bottle. Enjoy by APR 19 03 Usual well-designed Victory graphics adorn bottle, with leafy HopDevil character. Short blurb describing the spirit of the beer.  Cost: $6.99 6-Pack at Bottle King  Presentation: Pint glass at 45º-50º  Appearance: Medium dirty-blond color. A bit cloudy. Loose, light white head, settles quickly to a thin film. Exhibits some small-caliber bubbles.  Smell: Hops are very evident, along with some strong citrusy notes. Malt struggles up through the sharper notes. A bit aggressive at first, but evens out as the head settles. A nice, but somewhat one-dimensional aroma.  Taste: The taste is a bit more balanced than the aroma. I am not normally a fan of overly hopped beers, but this one accomplishes it a bit better than most. First sharpness of hops and citrus bite are somewhat moderated by the malt and alcohol warmth. Clean and but a bit thin and brittle without being sharp. The middle and finish are a bit insubstantial and short. A touch too dry. Id like to give it a 4.25.  Mouthfeel: Nice carbonation, smooth and even, but a bit coarser than Sierra Nevada Celebration and a touch watery.  Drinkability: Very drinkable. At the price and ABV, this is an excellent go-to beer for every season. On draught, this would probably be fuller and softer (as suggested by other reviewers), and more enjoyable for me overall.  This is an excellent effort, but I think that this is not as good as the SN Celebration. Perhaps this is an unfair comparison as one is a seasonal special and costs $1-$2 more, but stylistically they are similar. Celebration is definitely NOT a barley wine. Given the choice, Id buy extra Celebration and set it aside, but this is a great alternative.  Backwash: As this is practically a local brew and readily available year-round at a relatively low price, it is virtually untouchable for value. A great all-around beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

The body in my mouth is firm, yet softly rounded. Overall, definitely and IPA, but a bit on the hoppy side for my evolving taste.  Bright and colorful eye-catching label with a picture of some hops with devil's horns. I've heard alot of good things about this beer but it wasn't as ""over the top hops"" as I expected.

With a smooth pour and a foggy amber color with a bubbly off-white head I was ready to go. the smell had a nice fruity, floral sensation with a definite hop quality. The first sip was everything I was expecting. A rich, full body witha complex array of hops and citrus flavors with a mellow dry aftertaste. This warmed me up on a less than warm night, but I could also drink 4 or 5 of these on a hot summer day. No matter what you like this is a keeper.

I love IPAs -- Bass, of course, the first, then I was introduced to the local brew in Harpoon IPA back when it was a seasonal. Then came Tremont, Shipyard Fuggles, Sam Adams, etc. Traveling I savored Bridgeport IPA, Goose Island IPA, and Rogue Brutal Bitter, but, sadly, they are not available in MA. Then one chilly evening I found Victory Hop Devil in my favorite ""packy"" (Macy's).  I see that some have mentioned Stone in the same breath as Hop Devil; I can't compare, as Stone in $10 a six as opposed to $7 for Hop Devil. However, I find it difficult to believe that it is $3 better. Hop Devil smells wonderful, and tastes even better. Feels great on the tongue, and rolls down smoothly. The only problem is that its so good and refreshing it's hard to to sip!  If you like your ale on the hoppy side, you can't go wrong with Hop Devil. It's as good as any out there, and better than most...and I swore by Harpoon for years!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Caramel covered spicy hop cone smell. Fresh hay and barnyard notes. Grass and some mild pine hop scents come through after agitation. The flavors are just great. Plenty of resin hops to go around with a spicy kick. The caramelish malts only poke through at the very initial taste and then drowns on a sea of resin hops. The aftertaste is dominated by a strong and delicious bitter hop bite that lasts and lasts. Medium body with lots of coating and a slick sensation. The hops are slightly rough and makes for a dry finish. Highly drinkable, especially in todays warm summer weather.

The nose on this beer let's you know what you are in for with grapefruit rind and little buttery malt presence. This beer is very good. It is very hoppy and has all the floral nose and tastes you would expect x 2. The hops in this beer reallly make it enjoyable and not overdone in regards of bitterness. It has a big malt and toastyness that comes through for a good balancing act but is then taken over by long spicy hop finale.

Taste was hoppy and a bit peppery I want to say as the beer had a spicey kick to it. Still it was a bit smoother than most West Coaster's, I thought it very nice and drinkable.

Flavor begins with some caramel, and finishes with a somewhat acidic grapefruit... and a fair amount of bitterness... although it's nicely balanced by the malt. Somewhat prickly with a medium body.

345,1005,TheLongBeachBum,4.27,"A facetious hop leaf label resplendent with a bitter green evil wry smile affronts the obverse of the Bottle label. Good vs Evil Maybe. Pours an iridescent, deep amber, anti-religious color, with copper clad spikes. Is it Easter? If not. The uprising in this beer is way too early, Easter is 4 months away so put that rock back. The head is a light tan frothy number nailed to the head that collapses slowly but surely. Leaves a frothy, but smooth looking voluminous rocky head that smatters its entrails on the glass sides. The Romans would have loved that. A fresh hoppy aroma introduces a green hop bitterness that clubs the cheeks. Mouthfeel is solid. I Think this beer is AReligious, thank goodness, because so am I. Nail this beer to the wall, saturate its open wounds in Malt Vinegar, spear its heart, and then profess your undying love for something that you never believed in. Oh dear, now I am being sarcastic. So lets be serious. Hopsheads will love this evil offering. OK, so you're expecting a Biblical comment right? Well I&#8217;m an Athiest, so this will have to do;  The Devil walks into a crowded bar. Within seconds the bar emptied with people running out screaming all over the place, all except for one old man leaned over the bar drinking Victory Hopdevil.

Hop Devil Ale &#8211; What can I say, I think Pontious Pilot drank this beer before he was &#8220;Paid&#8221;, I am sure. Well at least before he was enticed to invest in Enron.

345,1005,mzwolinski,4.3,"Deep copper, amber in color, with a thinnish, smooth off white head. Decent lace down the glass. Nose is hoppy and citric. Flavor starts off caramel sweet, with a strong, fairly rough hop flavor throughout. Hops lend a good blend of citric and floral flavors to the brew, with spicy and acidic notes present throughout. Well-carbonated, but fairly creamy in body, with a medium-light mouthfeel and a dry finish. Nice hop aftertaste. Overall a good IPA, though I probably wouldn't rank it top #10. Seems a bit one dimensional compared to, say, Stone's Ruination.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Mick,4.8,"I've had this both bottle and tap. I have equally enjoyed both but found the bottle to be fresher, more likely than not a serving issue on the establishment with the tap.  Clear dark amber fluid pours out a nice head. Hop aroma hits the nose like a boxer going in for the kill caramel backs it up. Bitterly and menacingly flavorful, more hops than a gaggle of rabbits. I don't know of another beer that is more possessed by the hop spirit than this one. Dry bitter but thick full body that maintains as well till the end.  Hoptopia for the hop heads.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Lupe,4.45,"Pours a light amber color, slightly hazy, with an off-white foamy head, that turns into a thin layer, and laves nice lace. Aroma is all hops, floral and citrus. Medium bodied with a nice, smooth mouthfeel. Taste is very much like the aroma. Lots of hop flavor, citrus, grapefruit, and floral tastes. Malt is somewhere in the backround. Different hop flavors along with the toasted malt in the backround make this a nice balance of flavor, and not a shocking hop bitterness. Finishes slightly bitter with some spiciness. A very good IPA. Sit back and enjoy!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,MJR,4.47,"Appearance: Pours a beautiful orange/reddish color with great clarity. A good-sized head stays pretty well and has a nice sheeting effect down the side of the glass.  Smell: Cascade hops and all the wonderful scents that come with them: pine, grapefruit, citrus... A touch of sweet malt too. Great aroma!  Taste: A skillful balance of sweet malt and hop bitterness and flavor. The cascade hops certainly make themself known. Lots of pine, grapefruit, a touch of pineapple, a bit of a flowery taste, and a bitterness that finishes out strong. I pick up on a touch of toffee throughout as well. Nice balance.  Mouthfeel: Very soft and rounded, with a smooth, medium thickness.  Drinkability: Good. Some American Pale Ales knock you over with hops...this one has just as much as the next one, but in a beautiful balance with the malt flavors.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Jarod,4,"Not a huge hop fan as of yet, but slowly becoming one. This beer poured into the glass a bright amber/copper color. There were slight bubbles as you peered into the glass. The head seemed quiet thick and white. The lace clinged to the sides dragging the whole way down. The aroma was dominated by the hops. There were hints of citrus and sweet malt as well. The taste was big. Much like the aroma the hoppy taste was present. But through the hops you notice slight fruit like grapefruit. You also notice hints of a toasted malt. A good beer, a bit strong if you are just starting to review hoppy beers, but I would come back, and try more.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,maxpower,4.38,"Bright copper color, nice thick head, clings to the glass. Aroma of citrus and pine resin. This IPA is very balanced malty with a great hop bite, I like to keep a supply of this awesome brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,MaineBeerMan,4.62,"Beautiful clear copper color, with a big white head that a bit of lace on the glass. Aroma is all citrusy grapefruit hops with just a bit of a dry grass to it. The flavor is very nice lots of grapefruity hop citrus up front, some husk flavors and the slightest toasty malt hiding in the background. Clean crisp drying hop finish. Slick smooth mouthfeel with a mild carbonation makes this a very drinkable beer that leaves you wanting another. Thanks to NeroFiddled for providing this as part of a beer trade.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,HossMcGraw,4.16,"After properly aquiring a taste for this beer, I needed to re-review this. It's like, the BOMB baby! I can't really do it justice by writing about it but I'm doing it anyway. It's very hopppy and bold. The hops quite obviously dominate, but a subtle yet noticeable spicy-sweetness is also pretty big on ye olde palate. It took me a few of these to realize how great it was,and your macro drinking ass may need to develop a taste for this as well. Impeccably brewed and unbelievably delicious, HopDevil is the beer you should be drinking.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,RBorsato,4.57,"Copper, amberish color with a light tan head. Huge grapefruity citrus hop aroma ! Hop flavors are very high with an assertive hop bitterness. Medium bodied (leans light) and smooth. I tasted little malt character but this beer was not overly bitter to me since the hop character is so citrusy pleasant.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,QXSTER1,4.43,"I've had Hop Devil numerous times in the bottle but never on cask. It's a different animal altogether. Even poured a lighter copper than the bottled version. Nose was of subtle hops but not overpowering and the head was a perfect white, dense, creamy wonder that stuck to the glass leaving tons of lace. The taste at cask temperature seemed softer and more sophisticated. The hops were still featured but with more nuance and complexity. The firm malt background folded into the rounded citric character of the hops moreso than the bottled version. It was definitely like drinking a different beer with both being outstanding. The bottle version is an in your face hophead's delight while the cask was it's more profound cousin.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,tigerpaws,4.42,"A hopheads delight! Poured a very dark coppery color with a nice head and decent lace as you drank it. Definant hoppy aroma but not overly so, just right IMO. Had a great but powerful hoppy taste but also smoothed out on the tongue with a nice malt taste. I would drink this beer over and over again...............CHEERS",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,LiamStLiam,4.3,"This beer lasts a *long* time.  I got to a 20-count at times.  Fills your mouth.  But not very heavy.  I had seen it before. Nice packaging, Tried it because I saw it on this site.  I will buy it again.  Adding to the review eight months later: I have bought this beer several times since my original review, and I continue to find it a good change of pace. It is a very full beer, you have to pay attention when you drink it, but it's worth the attention.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,mickstepp,4.92,"Wow! The hops just explode on the palate. Lovely reddish brown color. Nice creamy head but doesn't last long. Leaves a decent lace. I love the pungent hoppy aroma and the faint citrusy notes. Exceptional finish, you get a nice hop burn long after the last sip has gone down. One of the 5 best American Pale Ales I have ever had. Oddly, it's not that easy to find in neighboring Ohio. I hope I can track down Victory's other offerings.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,HopheadEd,4.7,"Originally, I did not want to review this ale, as everyone before me has done an excellent job. But with a screen name like mine, I thought I must. Cloudy, amber color, which in my opinion is the true color of beer. The head is white, frothy and lasts throughout the pint. The lace rings a perfectly spaced layer until the bottom. Your first smell is pure heaven, as there is no better aroma then that of hops. Strong but not overwhealming. The taste is so well balanced you don't know which comes first, though I know it's the hops. Nice malt taste is there, mellow, bringing up the rear as it were, again balancing the hops. Don't let the name fool you, it's hoppy, but not to the point where you are scraping your tongue. Absolutely one of my favorite beers, and a standard in the fridge all year, especially in the summer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,boblinneman,5,"Two words to describe Hopdevil COMPLEX yet BALANCED! Its hard for me to give a perfect rating, but this beer really does have it all. Its a rollercoaster ride for your tastebuds. Victory does not over hop this IPA to make a name for themselves, (ex. 90minuteIPA or Ruination) they just made the perfect beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,doho95fu,4.77,"The appearance is amber with a nice head and lacing. The beers smells sweet with hops and a hint of the malt. The initial taste is strong with the hops, but the overall beer takes away most of the shock. Although I am a hophead and it may shock people who do not enjoy strong hops flavor. The taste, as I said, is hoppy, but some sweet additions seem to tone it down. The beer is very drinkable and I was glad I was in Philly this weekend to try it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,zakery,4.38,"Pours a clear amber with a fluffy off-white head.  The smell is bold and a little fruity. It has an under-tone of blackberry jam and an over-tone of citrus.  It provides a medium bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation.  The taste is hoppy and the malt is there but takes the backseat in this brew. I can taste fresh citrus and it provides a medium to medium-high bitterness with a slightly dry finish. There is none of the berries in the taste, but has a mellow. little sweet and smooth feel to it.  Not for the faint of heart or macro-drinker, this brew is great for good-beer-lovers that want a little edge and have a thing for layered tastes of hops.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,allboutbierge,4.33,"My beer buddy and I picked a couple of these beers up at D's Six Pack and Hotdog in Regent Square, PA. We found that that beverage starts off with a ruby brown color that lasts throught the glass. The head dies quickly, but lace remains around the edge the whole way down. The hops are dominating in the aftertaste, but do not overwhelm the beer. This IPA leaves a tangy aftertaste, which is almost similiar to a grapefruit. On a side note, the carbination in this beer is barely noticable. It still dances on ones tonge, but either of us have felt the urge to burb while enjoying this quality IPA. We will contine to taste test beers and report throught the night.  5KD",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,JeffreyG,4.38,"I just finished a sixer of this brew, and I liked it more as each bottle went down. I like hoppy beers, but not really to the point where I consider myself a hophead. At first the hops are a little shocking (even though you have to expect them from a beer called HopDevil), but once you get over the initial pop this turns out to be a fairly balanced beer. This is exactly what a great beer should be: Interesting flavor that has such depth that you discover something new each time you try it. And keeps you looking forward to the next one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,ZAP,4.23,"This is an excellent IPA..right up there with, but not better than, Bell's Two Hearted Ale....It pours a rich, deep copper with a litte white lace..the nose is a wondefull mix of floral and spicy hops...the taste is bitter grapefruit style hops along with some decent malt to balance...I'd love to see the bittering units on this as it is very high I'm sure...but at the same time it is relatively balanced....Definitely west coast style..some great hop flavor to this....a very good/borderline great IPA...I love this Brewery...they rock!!!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Realale,4.23,"Absolutely beautiful, full rich copper-red color. Nice head that stuck around through most of the glass. Nose is not as hoppy as I expected from an American IPA, let alone one called Hop Devil. There is a significant sweet malty note on the nose as well. Beautifully integrated on the palate - impeccable balance. The bitterness is more prominent on the palate than on the nose and contributes significantly to a very long finish. Disappears quickly. Top notch American IPA. A touch more hop on the nose, and it would seriously challenge Bell's Two-Hearted Ale as my favorite within the style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,garymuchow,4.02,"Maybe I'm an underdog kind of guy, but this didn't please me as much as I had hoped, not that it's not a good beer, because it is, but I'm not sure that it's astoundingly better than several others that can be found. Hop aroma,with a soft citrus element, backed with other hop qualities (like mild grassiness). Thin to medium head with medium length. Clear amber to copper color. Hops through and through, although not explosive and they tend to be stronger in the middle to finish with a long lingering pleasing bitterness to close. Malt offers some balancing. Softer mouthfeel in both body and carbonation, although adequate carbonation noted. I'd like to try one of Nero's cask conditioned versions.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,NeroFiddled,4.5,"It's amazing what cask conditioning can do! I'll assume everyone is familiar with the standard Hop Devil (if not, check out the standard reviews first). The color remains the same, but the head holds to the end of the glass and gives a solid wall of lace. The cask version also has a much lighter nose - I guess that's mainly because the limited carbonation brings it up less. Smooth hop & malt aroma. It has a light silky mouthfeel. The flavor expresses a soft malt of light, sweet biscuity caramel, and a more balanced grassy hop flavor and bitterness. So English! A totally different beer! You wouldn't think the bottled version could do this. Similar, in many ways, to Young's Dirty Dick. I'm sure that the standard draft or bottled version would stand up to some spicy fries, but the cask version gets a little lost. Absolutely worth trying. No wonder it did so well at the 2002 GBBF!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Jon,4.33,"This is one of the best, most balanced IPAs I've tasted. Hop Devil pours a nice copper color. Its sticky head lasts and lasts, leaving an incredible trail of Brussels lace behind. Wow. The smell is of hops and a bit of citrus. The big hops flavor is backed up perfectly with a big malt profile, which makes for an incredibly balanced IPA. I really can't believe how good this is. This beer certainly lives up to its reputation.  Transparent copper with a sticky cream-hued head. Nice retention and even better lacing. Nose inludes notes of sappy pine, citrus and some residual malt sweetness. Taste is abundantly hoppy with characteristic notes of mild grapefruit and pine needles backed by a substantial, sweet caramel malt profile. Smooth mouthfeel and excellent balance with an emphasis on hops make this an enjoyable, highly drinkable IPA. West Coast style from a great East Coast brewery. Great stuff.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,marc77,4.37,"Deep copper / red in hue w/ a moderate, sticky, head that leaves sparse lace. Buttery malt, caramel, toffee sweetness & biscuit notes are accompanied by a pungent citrusy and floral hop nose. Overall the aroma is a nice balance of malt notes & aromatic hops. Flavorwise the balance is striking-- The malt profile is quite rich & is comprised of nutty, caramelly, and fruity melaniodins only acheivable by continental malt. Malt is balanced by assertive, but clean hop bitterness. HopDevil is a big and flavorful IPA and not nearly as bitter as the name woud imply. Hop flavor is citrusy and herbal. Full bodied for style. Finishes w/ bittersweet residual sweetness & hop bitterness. Quite a rich IPA-- beautifully heavy with malt character. Very tasty.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Wildman,4.63,"Well I finally got to try this. The supply of Victory's recently dried up in Columbus. But my favorite beer supplier came through. This beer poured a lovely reddish copper color and formed a nice off white head that left some nice lace. The aroma was of malt and citrus-grapefruit. The flavor was of malt, caramel and hops. The finish is sweet and astrigent. Also the alcohol makes it's presence known in the finish. A great beer. Now the big decision, which do I get at the store, Victory's or Stones? Definately different characters which makes the decision even harder. Definiately worth the wait and harassing I gave my stores.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Jason,4.5,"A bit dryer and crisper than on-tap, the clarity is a shade clearer but still hazy with a frothy sticky head. Quite aromatic with lots of semi-coarse hop, lightly toasted grain alcoholic esters. The flavour is a mirror image of the aroma with lots of hops in the bitterness and flavour. I prefer it on draft though, probably because I usually drink it our of a 32oz mug at Bukowskis Tavern.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,LarryV,4.37,"Nice reddish amber color. Virtually no head, minimal carbonation. Nice balance of malt ands hops. I think I would have liked a bit more carbonation, this particular pouring seemed almost flat to me. Still tasted delicious though.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Thrasher,3.7,"Overrated, to be sure, and completely off-balance, but still worth drinking. With a name like HopDevil you should know exactly what you are getting into. What is surprising is the generous malt profile this beer contains. A real caramel sweetness with hints of butter, nuts, honey, molasses, provides the sturdy foundation for this beer. But of course this is all to make room for the insane hop element, although I drank Victory's Prima Pils before this and was thrown off by the amount of hops in that beer. Only in that context can this one seem tempered. Otherwise, you'd damn well better be in the mood for hops. (You could say the same about Prima Pils, which I found out of whack for the style.) Delectable, sticky on the tongue, with lasting lingering floral & spicy notes. Drinkability low due to unbalanced hop element. Not my fav and certainly not worthy of its overwhelming acclaim, but when a beer is this degree of quality, why should I complain?",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,RonfromJersey,4.85,"Gorgeous copper body. Nice rocky off white head. Disipates too soon. Very good lacing. Fine (as in very small) carbonation rising. Aroma of floral hops is intense at arm's length. Bittering hops come through nose up close, with strong dose of citric. Strong malt presence balances hops until delightful hop tingle in aftertaste. Taste is so good it is actually difficult to keep from chugging the entire glass. Victory has several remarkable beers, but if this was their only product, they would still be an outstanding brewery.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Murph,4.73,"Pours a bright copper color with a good sized rocky head that fades a little too quickly but leaves a great lace. Smell is tons of floral hops, bitter hop oil, and hop leaves with some sweet malt in the background. Very floral and slightly citrusy hops own this beer making it very bitter and hoppy. For all the hops though there is just enough smooth maltiness for this to remain well balanced. The malt combines with the hops to produce an almost fruity taste at times. The brew is fairly creamy from the malt but is nicely crisp and refreshing at the same time and it is extremely drinkable as well. This is one great brew and yet another amazing one from the boys in Downington.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,rotsaruch,4.88,"I feel bless and cursed in living so close to Victory - less than 15 minutes away. As usual quality is exceptional with all their brews, but this weekend the finest balance, smoothest drinking HopDevil was available on the hand pump. The hops were there with fruity flavor and delicious bouquet and malty finish. It was considered desert after a great round of golf.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,ElGuapo,2.95,"she's got some kick, but it is a little spicy for me. as far as ipa's go, this one is definitlely one of the best. You will get a load of hops with this brew. It is a pretty intense beer because the hops and carbonation team up to give you a kick in the pants.  The aromas are also wonderful as you are engulfed in an array of spices that makes you want to leap into the glass. I will definitely have to get this one again now that i have some more IPAs to compare it to.  After I have developed a love for IPAs, this one has to be sampled again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

345,1005,CharlesRiver,4.65,This is by far one of the best IPA's that I have had. A small head with a cloudy appearance made it great to look at.

345,1005,IrishRedRock,4.52,"This is THE ultimate session brew. As a hophead, I am in love with this beer. I like the Wallop more overall, but I could drink these for the rest of eternity. The hops are combined perfectly with everything else in this tasty brew. So well balanced. Crisp maltiness, fruity, hoppy, yeah. Smooth initially, and finishes with some killer hops at the end. Looks very nice...a cloudy amber, almost orange. Not the best tasting beer I've ever had, but arguably the best overall beer there is.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,jreitman,4.6,"I do not consider myself a hop man at all, but this brew was a very pleasant experience. The beer is orange, almost amber in color with a very hoppy nose. While very hoppy and bitter, the beer still had some nice malt sweetness to it which was a pleasant surprise. Fairly complex IMO and I enjoyed every sip. A great beer indeed.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,AaronRed,4.3,"I had to try this beer due to it's massive following in BA. I do love hops, so I knew I would love this beer.

345,1005,proc,4.97,"As my beer knowledge grows, I have found that I have gone from a newbie a few years ago who would cringe at the taste of hops to a seasoned pro, who craves a hoppy beer. I compared this to my beloved Bell's Bell's Two Hearted and found it to be just as good, excellent even. Pours out to a beautiful copper, with a slight head. Taste and smell is that of grapfruit and other citrus. The hop taste is fantastic, but doesn't overwhelm the beer. I believe this is due to my palate digging hops, someone who is new to beer would probably make a face. Unlike one of the other reviewers who said they probably could only have one or two, I believe this could be a session quaffer. It went down that easy. I still give Bell's a slight nod over Victory ONLY because Victory isn't available in Michigan and Bell's cloudy, golden give it just a slight appearance grade higher. But, if this beer were available here...it'd be a tie.  A big thanks to pbrian for sending this my way!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,sponberg,4.03,"Sampled: 12 oz. bottle, in pint glass. Beautifully coppery color that screams ""DRINK ME!!""  Aroma: Intensely florally hoppy. Starts out with a hop hit that would normally have me saying ""Uh-oh..."" and reaching for a grapefruit knife. But it remains in balance - the Cascade hops just are there, pronounced, throughout the swallow. The background flavors that peek through are bitterness and a rounded caramel maltiness.  If you were to graph the flavor profile of this beer, it'd be a straight line - no switchover between hoppiness and maltiness, bitterness and sweetness. It retains its predominantly floral hop flavor throughout at about the same degree of hop-malt balance. A very nice American IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90

Nice appeareance, amber with decent head. Nice sweet malt really balances the hops. Just not the great earth-shattering experience I remember after Terrapin Rye PA and Stone's IPAs.  5/6/02: I have to admit that this beer surprised me. I'm usually kind of iffy on IPAs and other hoppy beers, but I really liked this one. The aroma is very floral/perfumy. The taste is definitely hoppy, but not so bitter as to overwhelm the rest of the flavors in the beer. My fiancee described it as like drinking perfume, and it did have a powerful floral quality to it.

Very nice hop bite, grapefruit including some bitter rind flavors. Malts are clearly in the background. Hops are pronounced but not overbearing, settles to a mild bitterness at the back of the mouth with just a touch of sweetness. Refreshing. Probably my favorite American I.P.A. to date.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,StevieW,4.85,"The hop devil lives up to the hype. Nice red-amber color, darker than I expected. Very big hoppy nose. Nice easy taste, lingered on the tongue.Big spice flavor, florals, hops, is there cinnamon in there ? It sure tasted like it to me. Strong bitterness at the end wakes you up and demands another taste. A proven winner and worth the wait. I have been trying to get it in Florida for a while.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Erix,4.58,"The quintessential IPA in my book. Heavy hops create a very spicy, qrapefuity beer. If I had one in hand I could review better, but being at work right now... I have to say the only IPA I've had which I could say for sure was better than HopDevil is cask conditioned hopdevil. The cask conditioning seems to mellow out the hops a decent amount by taking a tiny bit of the bite off, without compromising that awesome spiciness. Works even better at celler temps when cask conditioned than when poured from a bottle.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,frank4sail,5,"Ya know how redheads are either ""hot as hell"" or well ya know a ""train wreck"". Well this is one ""hot"" devil. Bright bubbles, hypnotic in its bitterness. The aftertaste has addictive overtones of flowers, perfume, and a high heel against the backside. God I love the Devil out of this beauty. Sorry about the description, but this is a top ten beer on the wish list..",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,WilliamPhilaPa,4.68,"A very good...and it does live up to it's name HopDevil. Amber color is darker then SN-pale ale, with a bit more bite on the mouth. Very hoppy indeed! The malt is very nice too, its sweetness balancing the hop bitterness. A bit of warming in the belly in the finish. Defines the true American style IPA! Cheers!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Bierman9,4.35,"Cask review from 04MAY02... On cask at NERAX.... pleasing copper color, with a small, fine head. Nose is hops, hops, and hops! Mmmm. Decent smoothness/body, overall. Flavor was hops from start to finish... Not as aggressive as the bottle/tap version, though. Felt it was mellowed a bit by the oaky cask flavors... Still an A-1 bier!!  overall: 4.4 appearance: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | mouthfeel: 4 | drinkability: 4  *** ***  On-tap review of 09FEB02... On draft, dark copper color, maybe a tad cloudy (?) but enticing. Fine creamy head which fades away.... Nose is pleasant, floral and attracting! Has medium-full body, and medium-smooth tongue....goes down nicely! Semi-sweet, malty (biscuity? really?) start which segues nicely into a smooth floral hoppiness!!! I like it!!!! Sampled also from the bottle...same dark, copper color, but no cloudiness....other attributes are the same... A-1 IPA! Also enjoyed often from the bottle.... (4.5/4.5/4.5/4.5/4.5 = 4.50)  41",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,mophie,5,"This is my favorite IPA. I think the brewmasters at Victory describe it best, and I quote: ""Bold, spicy and menacingly delicious, this American-hopped India Pale Ale offers an aromatic punch and then follows through with a lasting, full-bodied finish."" Agreed.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,pbrian,4.94,Grinning ear-to-ear now that my local carries this. I was expecting an overpowering glass of hops and got a beautifully balanced big IPA. Compares to a SN Celabration but softer with less bite. $7.99/six is gonna set me back some cash over time.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,Todd,4.47,"12oz brown bottle with a very cool label ... it's a devil face made out of hop leaves.  Appearance: Hazy orange/copper beer with a patchy cream off-white foam head that clings to the sides of the glass.  Smell: Very pronounced grapefruit hop aromas, spicy with background sweet malts and a faint bready grain aroma.  Taste: Whoa! This is one bold, dangerous and outrageous beer! Mouthfeel is ultra-smooth and creamy with a malty thick full-body. The initial taste is an absolute hop assualt on the palate! A spicy, stinging and salty plethora of citric nuances literally overwhelm the senses. Earth, leaf and grass flavours pull-thru, then are followed by an alcohol presence and spiciness. The malt in this beer is definately present but gets its ass fiercly kicked by the hops. Malt includes some toasted, slightly bready and light honey flavours with an even malt sweetness. It hardly balances the beer, but does keep it somewhat control. Beer finishes with residual hop spice and malt sweetness, which tends to linger for some time.  Notes: This is a very hyped-up beer, and it should be as it is an absolutely marvelous beer for all the hop-heads out there, albeit very daunting for those who are not into hops to the extreme. For what it is, it's crafted to near perfection. A ""Wow!"" beer for sure. 6.7 % abv.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,bcm119,4.22,"Edit: Tasted again. Still a great IPA. Perfectly balanced ripe citrus hops with english toffee malt flavors. Nice full mouthfeel and a zippy, clean finish. Highly drinkable because its complex enough to keep drinking. Outstanding.  First review: Beautiful orange color. Overwhelmingly fresh, spicy citrus flavor. Medium bodied caramel malts. Clean finish.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
345,1005,John,5,"HopDevil is without question, in the top five of the American IPA catagory. Probably in the top ten best beers of any kind. Excellent.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American IPA,90
