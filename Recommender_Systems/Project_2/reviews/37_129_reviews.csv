Feel- Between thin and medium body, slightly above average carbonation, moderately bitter, highly dry finish, mildly creamy.  Overall- Look was deep amber with above average head retention and lacing. Bouquet was pleasant with floral and fruity notes. Flavor was good, but was much weaker than expected. This beer had between thin and medium body with slightly above average carbonation and a highly dry finish.

It's seriously that good. It is a definite possibility that this beer is the best Belgian beer in the world, and thus, the best beer in the world.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,Sheppard,4.13,Pours a reddish amber hue with white head. It's musty and I get a hint of the yeast character on the nose. Maybe some caramel apple.

37,129,Fabry,5,Orval does not have to be explained. You simply have to drink it cold 6-8 degrees then you can also taste it at 14 as some sites propose. I answer to davidward.

37,129,Hooded,4.59,"Notes from 7/6/2022. Bottled October 13, 2021. Best buy October 13, 2026. Poured from a bottle into a Rastal nucleated Teku glass. The body is orange-yellow with 4 fingers of white head. Retention is insanely great. It's the best head retention I've seen. The intensity of aroma is medium-high. There are notes of ripe pair, maybe tart apple, a little grapefruit, a sour note and complex aromas I cannot parse. When the head dissipates, I can smell much more. The aroma is rather intoxicating. The intensity of taste is medium-high. The flavor has a complex fruitiness that I cannot parse. The first sip had a funky note that I did not like. It quickly went away. The bitterness is moderate and well balanced with the overall flavor. The feel is somewhat thick. The carbonation gives it an effervescent quality. Astringency is low. Overall, drinking it seems like something special. It's unlike most all other beers. I felt the ABV. I very much like it and will definitely purchase a few more bottles so I can get a better feel for it.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,Darkmagus82,4.25,"I have had this beer many times and much enjoy it. I can’t believe I never actually reviewed it. So here it goes Poured from a can into tulip glass Appearance – The beer pours a hazed deep amber color with a huge head of puffy white foam. The head has amazing retention, slowly fading over time and leaving a ton of foamy and streaky lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma is strong of a biscuit malt mixed with lots of coriander and some clove. Along with these aromas comes notes of yeast and apricot as well as a touch of pepper and hay. Taste – The taste begins with a nice crisp cracker and biscuit malt flavor mixed with a nice blend of spice of coriander, clove, and white pepper. Other flavors of yeast and herb are there as well, blending nicely with the malt and spice. There is a bit of sweetness mixed within as well, with notes of apricot, peach, and white grape. The taste remains similar in nature throughout, maintaining a smooth and balanced flavor. A touch of hay joins in at the end, leaving one with a flavorful, but nice crisp and clean taste to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel- The body is very light and crisp with a carbonation level that is high. Fantastic for the style and taste and very easy drinking. Overall – A great Belgian pale ale. Super flavorful and amazingly easy to drink. Fantastic.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,lastmango,4.2,"L - Poured as directed by Orval leaving one centimeter in the bottle. Beautiful caramel-orange color with a three finger creamy head and aggressive carbonation. Head retention is the most I have seen on a beer. High lacing throughout the session.  S - I was surprised at the faintness of the nose. Some spice, citrus pith and malt. But, towards the end of the session, the spice and malt stepped up with a hint of bread. I then realized the beer was too cold.  T - Citrus peel, malt and hop bitterness, which is more pronounced than expected and nicely lingers on the finish. The hop bitterness is interesting because it is so balanced. Unlike other Belgian styles, this ale is only slightly sweet.  F - Medium-full bodied with high carbonation that becomes more tame. Medium dry finish. ABV is not overwhelming but you begin to feel it towards the end of your glass.  O - This is a strange beer for me. My first Belgian anything that was not sweet. Oh, and the bitterness through me for a loop. However, the bitterness was very nice and as the beer warmed, the aroma and flavor increased in layers. Definitely will have this again.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,NCSapiens,4.23,"I’m reminded of valet Chris Rock agape at Eddie Murphy’s dump truck in BHC2: I get $20 for a car, $50 for a limo, WTF is that???  Like nothing I’ve had before. Wild yeast, dry hopped, Belgian fruit notes, slight sweetness, light malt. Tastes like someone mixed a Belgian ale with a British pale ale. Awesome white head and golden body. Pungent spicy aroma. Unique and high quality.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,MikeWard,4.17,"Bottle at Sabatinis in Exeter pa earlier this evening. 2020 release. Orval Day 2022.  Looks splendid in the chunky Orval goblet. Hazy orange yellow body. Generous white head persists throughout leaving layers of lacing.  Some fruit notes on the nose, and the abv is apparent.  On tasting, strong and full flavored. Quite bitter, some light fruit wafts in and out. Abv seems higher than the 6.9 listed. A little sweetness here and there.  Mouth very full. Finish bitter and a little drying.  Overall, enjoyable drink once the palate adjusts to the bitterness level and can enjoy the nuances. Wouldn't say no to another.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,defunksta,3.86,"Appearance: Pours a completely clear, deep amber color with a massive off-white head that lingers like root beer float. (4.50)  Aroma: Moderate aromas of citrus upfront. Followed by grapefruit, juicyfruit, bubblegum, and bread spice esters. (4.00)  Flavor: Strong and funky flavors here. There's grapefruit and tart pear fruit. Then a strong funky yeast in the middle. A semi-sweet pale malt finish. The funk lingers. (3.75)  Feel: Medium-bodied. Strong carbonation. A full mouthfeel with a lingering funk. (3.75)  Compared to Saison Dupont 5/21/22: Pours a darker color, larger head. Stronger aromas. More funky yeast. Less juicyfruit and bread spice. A larger body, and sweeter.  Overall: A lot more barnyard funk on this one that I had expected. Almost overpowering. Granted, this one is about 3-5 years in age. Maybe more than usual wild yeast formed. Hard to get a whole lot of other flavors here because the funk and tart fruit overpower a bit. Not sure if this is normal for this one. I think this one may have been spoiled. Maybe I'll have to try it fresh sometime. (Rating: 3.86)",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Perioddicals,3.32,"L - Poured from a bottle into a Dogfish Head Signature Glass at around 55 - 60 degrees. (Bottled on 08/07/2021, poured on 05/10/2022.) Humongous off-white/bone white head on a not very aggressive pour. Head does not dissipate quickly. It’s frothy and foamy to no end. Lacing stays for the whole drink. It’s a light copper clear color. Incredibly appealing look.  S - Deep malt characteristics up front. Warm baked bread. A little yeast sweetness as well.  T - Taste is lighter than scent. More of a cracker or biscuit malt, with some sourness paired with sweetness. Light fruits come through as well. Maybe a citrus zest. Some earthy tones appear in there. Finish has some mild bitterness and pepperiness. The hoppy bitterness and pepper is more present as it warms up. These dry bitter flavors really overpower the second half of the drink.  F - Medium-to-heavy carbonation, but medium-to-light mouthfeel. Surprisingly dry finish. Almost like a brut champaign. The more I drink it, there’s a lot of dry aftertaste. Which is not appealing.  O - Overall, I love the complexity and mixture of this beer at the start. It begins as a great blend of malts, yeast, and light hops, with none of them overpowering the other. Each taste brings something a little different. Then, as you drink, the bitterness, dryness, and pepper starts to overpower. So much so, that my appreciation diminished by the end. I didn’t even want to take the last two gulps to finish it. Unfortunately, I will not add it to my rotation, and would not recommend in favor of other offerings.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,AlexandraDen,4.34,"Bottled Dec 21, 2021. Pours a hazy penny-copper colour with two fingers of thick, white head. It slowly collapses, sticking around a decent amount, into a millimetre (or two) thick dense foam cap.  Spicy and doughy aromas typical of Belgian yeast swirl with a little bit of floral, spicy hop notes. Caramel malt is present in good amount. Slight funky earthy spin, with good leanings towards some lightly musty but fruity affect — grape, apple, and citrus.  Feels like I’ve been waiting my whole life to try a beer like this, fusing my love of crisp pale ales and doughy Belgian ales. Spicy and fruity up front, biscuity and doughy on the back end, medium-low presence of bittering hops throughout that are primarily earthy and floral in quality. The spicy, peppery phenolic character is quite nice, and a little nutty as well, a mix between almond slices and cloves, white peppercorn and coriander. Citrus zest and peel is noticeable on the back half of each sip, and adds both a fresh quality and adds to the bittering presence of the hops. A beer that lets each note rise before melding into the next one before melding into the next one, which gives this beer a remarkably balanced taste profile. Grassy, zesty, earthy, mildly funky. The funk is stronger on the nose than palate.  Light-medium bodied with higher carbonation, fairly effervescent. Long, doughy and yeasty finish that leaves impressions of bitter hop and lemon peel on the edges of your tongue and hints of phenolic spice. Finishes dry.  A Belgian Pale Ale… Finally! I love PAs, and I absolutely adore Trappist ales. Combining the two, amazing! When the LCBO finally got a new batch in I could have it for the first time! This is a very fresh batch that I need to grab about 5 so I can cellar them and come back to this review every couple of months. Great fusion of flavours. I can see this mellowing and evolving over the years, though I imagine there’s likely a Goldilocks zone before it gets too aged it mellows out the great yeasty phenols as well as the grassy, fresh hops that are present in higher amounts than almost any other Trappist ale and most Belgians in particular. Lovely ale",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,kaiser_a,4.21,"I've read the previous review by illtexzona , and agree that freshness has to do a bunch with quality. the Whole Foods in my neighborhood started carrying Belgian & Trappist things & most recently Orval. I bought 2 almost immediately- probably the freshest Orval Ive had, & it's a completely different animal than the ones at the other most reputable liquor store- totally worth the (recently inflated) price.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,TooManyGlasses,3.75,"Bottled April 8/21. Pours a clear orange amber colour with teaming fluffy off white head. a bit of haze as got some dregs at last of pour. Fruity funky aroma - earthy hops, definite Brett effect - grape, lime, ripe apple - fruity esters, bubblegum and a touch of band aid. Taste follows with a funky fruity sweetness, that somehow manages to be tart and a bit spicy; notes of lemon, bubblegum, and at the back an aggressive bitterness that mixes with an herbal sweet-tart flavour. Exceptionally effervescent carbonation, boldly bittersweet and funky with a dry finish. Have had before and frankly enjoyed more - I feel I did not hit the sweet spot of age for me.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,LeRose,4.27,"I'd call it a deep honey color liquid with marshmallow fluff filling the glass. It is a little hazy but you can still see thru it. The head stubbornly falls to a dollop, but is leaving huge residue on the glass.  The aroma is fruity banana esters, slightly sweet, a bit of bubble gum. White grape, some extremely mild funk, some earthy brett. A bready note supports all of the aromatics. Maybe a little lemony citrus to cut through the rest and liven it up some.  The taste is intriguing. Not at all what I expected from the nose. It is really soft. I get the esters and bubblegum notes first with a lovely malty sweetness, but with further sips the aromatic notes recede a bit and it lays even more more malty and spicy. It strikes me more like a wild ale, quite yeasty but with more than enough malt to tie everything together. If it is funky at all, it is very laid back. There is spiciness that seems like a bit of coriander and a hint of anise. It's fairly phenolic giving it a nice peppery sensation. Noticeable amount of bitterness on the finish, and there is a lemon note that lingers and helps reset the taste buds.  I'd call the body medium, lively carbonation, pretty dry. The bitterness, while evident, is pleasantly mellow.  It's unique - and somehow everything that is going on plays nicely in the sandbox to deliver a highly enjoyable drinking experience that I really can't put into words. This is certainly a case where the gestalt matters. It's fun, makes me happy.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,TMoney2591,3.83,"Served from the bottle in a Boulevard tall tulip.  Pours a partly hazy sunrise auburn topped by over a finger of bone foam. The nose comprises sharp hay, dry biscuit, grass, sweet flowers, and funky wheat. The taste brings in more of the same, a touch of mild clove and black pepper swirling around in there as well. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a Death Valley level of dryness in the finish.

A - Pours copper orange, mostly transparent but some haze with the yeast, short white head, persistent cap, some lacing but not much.  S - Brett up front, bandaids and acidity, apple and white wine, grape highlights. As it warms, the Brett recedes and a powerful bubble gum sweetness comes forward.  T - Follows the nose, but with the acidity, fruit and a touch of bitter pith front, and the Brett coming in beneath. The plastic and barnyard notes are there but they work as a part of the whole.

I'd compare it to drinking a young lambic, and how it mellows out and flavors change over time. Young Orval pours with a ton white foam in the middle and whispy head around the edges. Tons effervescent carbonation and grassy hops. The belgian yeast hasn't had a lot of time to take over yet.

37,129,kbrokhoff,4.8,This is probably the best beer on the planet. No two Orvals taste the same; every bottle offers a unique experience. You can drink it fresh or aged.

Overall: This would be consider a ""young"" beer. Bottled in May 2021, drank in November. It still has the yeasty, hoppy character that mellows with age. Curious how this will taste about a year or two down the road. Pours super carbonated, producing a huge, fluffy off-white head, but seems to release the carbonation better than other Belgians.

Nice strong tall head that lasts. Great straw/orange colour. Taste is quite bitter to me, including a long aftertaste that i just cant shake.

This was one of the first Belgian ales from Belgium and the first Brett beer I ever tried over a decade ago and just as I was blown away then, I always am each and every time I have this amazingly deep, unique, and delicious beer.

37,129,zac16125,4.04,"330mL bottle into a tulip bottled on 4/3/20  Pours a slightly hazy, light copper color with a huge dense slightly off white head with great retention. Aroma is fruity and floral. Lots of sweet fruity esters including some banana and a big bubble gum presence. A champagne like grape character. Perhaps a touch of mustiness but I wouldn’t say that it is at all funky. Very nice nose. Taste is completely different than the nose. Almost none of the nice fruity esters from the aroma, much more earthy, dry floral, a bit funky with musty cellar, plastic, subtle underripe citrus. Mouthfeel has a medium body, carbonation is high, drinkability is average. Overall, it’s a very unique beer. Of course I’ve had this before but have just never rated it. I have not had it in years, the reason being I don’t love it.

A careful pour yielded a one inch off-white fluffy head that receded into a blanket of carbonation that lasted throughout. The aroma was that of some yeast, grassy hops, slight spice, malt, and barnyard funk. The first sip was full of unctuous yeast with an almost juicy quality that settled into spice and bitterness. As my palate adjusted and the beer warmed, the juicy qualities intensified along with the funky notes on the nose. The bitterness also mellowed pleasantly and worked well with a somewhat dry finish. The hops brought some brightness with their grassy and sometimes floral notes. The initial ample carbonation was almost unpleasant upon the first sips. It did not stay that way for long and found a middle ground of keeping the soft mouthfeel vibrant. It should not have taken this long, but my first experience with Orval was overwhelmingly positive.

37,129,AElfwine_Nerevar,4.72,"Happy Orval Day! Vertical tasting of 2 bottles dated: 09/18/2019 and 03/04/2020  L: Pours a deep gold with great clarity. A gentle pour results in a fine, white 3 fingers of pillowy head. Great retention as the head slowly falls to a nice 6 mm ring of head around the perimeter of the glass with the interior filled with a substantial sheet of head sustained by a plethora of carbonation streamers rising from the bottom of the glass. The head leaves an amazing mass of dense webbed lacing with large splotches of head still adhering to the glass.  S: Green apple, grainy malt character, hints of whole wheat bread crust, citrus notes, light notes of apricot, fresh cut hay, subtle earthy spiciness, and some Brett funk. Overall the nose is a bit subdued, but makes up for it with it's complexity.  T: Following the nose I get a touch of green apple, red grapefruit, apricot, grainy and bready malt notes lending sweetness, some fresh cut hay mixing with a light floral character, light notes of a dark earthy spiciness with hints of clove and subtle cardamom, and a medium bitterness on the back end that has aspects of citrus, funk, and floral notes. Brett funk character permeates the whole palate  F: Light to medium-light body with a high, prickly carbonation. The mouthfeel is slick but a bit of hop oil resin makes an appearance, and the finish has a light dryness. The bottle conditioning shines here.  O: There was not an appreciable difference between the two bottles from what I could tell, maybe a slightly faded nose with the 2019 vintage? Very saison-like, but very pale aleish as well. I like it. In fact I think I love it. The complexity and shelf stability working together in harmony earn this a 5 overall (especially in a vertical tasting). Not much else to say except that this is highly recommended!",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,TheHammer,4.23,"Appearance: Poured with two fingers of fluffy head that retained exceptionally well and produced a solid amount of lacing. The body is an opaque cloudy brown that leans a bit more towards amber when put up to the light, and is just translucent enough to see the ample carbonation rising from the bottle of the goblet I poured it into. The only thing stopping it from a perfect here is more lacing, and maybe a bit less brown, which I don't really expect in a Pale ale.  Smell: The smell here is everything I would expect from a hike in the country after the rain. I catch wet earth, with mild flowers of the forest, apricots, pear, figs and a hint of plum from the orchard, and grain and barnwood from the farm with maybe a flight bit of grapefruit and while it's probably not the best way to describe it, all with a slight after rain funk. Really that funk, not being able to place it, is my biggest complaint and that it's a bit off putting, but it's kept mild.  Taste: There is a dry leather funk that permeates the beer, and it's a bit more potent then I would like it to be, but it stays to the background, as it starts with grapefruit, multi-grain bread and a hint of clove that gives way to pear and fig before floral and earthy hops take over and round things out with a slight black pepper touch. The beer constantly evolves as apricot, wood and orange make appearances. The only constant though is that dry leather funk, which I really wish would go.  Mouthfeel: While the funk departs in the aftertaste, the dry part doesn't which is a bit of a downer. That transitioning is great, save that ever present funk. The carbonation is great as it helps out the entire beer and the aftertaste is a nice cinnamon and allspice raisin bread with a floral element to it.  Drinkability: Medium bodied, although that seems a bit deceptive given the ample carbonation, and that is made known after it is consumed. There are two major things that I am finding undesirable, the leather funk and the dry aftertaste. They are conspiring to make me partake of one to temporarily stop the other, which while is making me drink it fast, is doing so for the wrong reasons. Thankfully, the other flavorful notes in the beer, and mild aftertaste in brings to the table outweigh these concerns.  Final Thoughts: I was warned ahead of time, that Orval is by far the weirdest of the Trappist brews, and I can see why. It's got a strange funk to it (which seems to be identified in other reviews as Brettanomyces) which I don't seem to care for, but I know it is playing some kind of major role in the aspects of the beer I like, as there is a lot going on with this one. This is a pale ale, so I'm willing to excuse a bit of dryness, and by all accounts the strengths here, overpower the weaknesses. I'm honestly curious how this one will fare if given some time to mellow out or age. Thankfully I bought two bottles, which pretty much sums up this beer. This beer is a curiosity that doesn't seem satiated, before, during and after it has been consumed.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

The scent was like no beer aroma I have ever smelled. I don't even know how to begin to describe it. It's an interesting mix of cow pasture with a biscuity malty scent with a pear thrown in. There were hints of banana and stinky cheese mixed with sweet malt and a mellow hop earthy scent in there as well.  The taste was led by a slight malt sweetness of nutty fruity flavors that evolved into a slightly hoppy, spicy and somewhat fruity flavor ending with a dry bitter grapefruit taste that lingered long after the sip. There was a hint of warmth in the aftertaste as well.  The mouthfeel was well carbonated with a medium body to it.  Overall I loved this beer.

The taste follows the nose up front, through the middle and back and a bit thin (an artifact of aging perhaps?), but a taste most delightful and satisfying...sediment/yeast cake remains...

37,129,SierraNevallagash,4.16,"It's Orval Day! And I've never reviewed Orval? Let's fix that right now!  330ml bottle - bottled on 24/07/2019 - poured into a chalice at 45°F.  Pours a deep amber bronze colour, topped with nearly four fingers of light, airy, almost soapy light tan head, with remarkable retention. A stream of effervescence so intense and lively, it looks like a tornado, swirling upwards. Significant webby lacing left behind. What a beautiful beer.  Nose: Smells like Belgium. It's an interesting nose. Some soft malt, some pale grains, some spicy, slightly herbal hops, and then just an explosion of Belgian yeast. Part of it is very farmhouse-inspired, nodding towards saison, while other parts lend more of a Belgian pale ale vibe. There's also some subtle underlying estery and phenolic notes, lending a hint of clove, nutmeg, unripe banana, black pepper, apricot, peach, and pear. On the other end, there's actually a fair bit of funk - musty, dusty, even slightly cheesy, with some wet hay, wet wood, damp leaves, wildflowers, and a very distinct honey note. Beneath it all is just a wisp of what I would describe as old '70s perfume. Crazy aroma.  Palate: In terms of flavour, Orval's pale ale lineage becomes much more clear. It greets the palate with some dry grain and malt that, while not sweet, does in fact have a bready flavour. There's a melange of light, bright fruity notes - mostly pear, with some apple, apricot, plum, fig, and white grape, and then a firm hoppy bitterness emerges - spicy, herbal, and peppery, with notes of arugala, potpourri, allspice, hop resin, and perhaps even some pine. Some subtle saison notes do intermingle - mostly fresh grass, hay, and a spicy yeast note that even suggests some bretty overripe flavours, but then it finishes on the hoppier side, with more herbal, spicy, peppery, leafy bitterness, some dusty grain, and bone dry. Lingering leafy bitterness.  Mouthfeel/Body: The beer is quite light and fluid, with very little in the way in terms of any kind of malt weight. The two defining features are the slightly oily finish, and the insane level of effervescence. This beer essentially feels like seltzer in that regard - lively, racey, coarse bubbles. Dry overall. Crisp.  Overall: No doubt a unique Belgian pale ale. There are a few well-known examples, and this one probably gets the most recognition. I will not pretend like the aroma isn't insanely complex - it is. It's certainly a fantastic example of a BPA, and it probably sets the bar for the style. I personally enjoy Allagash House Beer a bit more, in terms of drinkability, but for price and availability, this is definitely the gold standard, and a must-try classic.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,monkist,4.76,"Hey hey ho! I think I’m starting to like Belgian beer! At the same time I think this rather classifies as a “Trappist beer” instead of a typical “Belgian beer” because it’s just different - the yeast, the hops, the feel, the whole thing. First of all, I love brett, Prairie and the like with their wild ales and farmhouse ales are one of my favorite beer varieties. And then comes this one, with the same amazing wild fermentation and quality - with a tradition and history of almost a hundred years! I love its aroma, its champagne-like quality, perhaps it’s not that spikey but rather rounder off, very elegant but fascinating. The first sip into it felt slightly bitter but from then on it immediately started tasting like a hop-forward beer and not without a reason. No idea what hops they used but it is very tasty and lacks that typical English bitterness, perfectly well done. The body is quite light and it feels almost dry, like a saison or a wild ale should be and the brett is prevailent. This brett in question has a very nice taste, not overwhelming, it just makes you want to drink more (was quite hard to pour it without a large head because of its intensity...) There is a slight booziness to it, unlike the farmhouse ales but it’s very well disguised, goes perfectly well with the taste and feels great. What should I say? I expected an “older” type of beer, maybe less interesting from an Abbey beer but I was wrong. It is quite modern and interesting, actually good to know where many of today’s great beers got their inspiration from. A quite unique beer, considering its history and everything, it’s understandable that the brewery makes only this one single beer - as with this, nothing else is necessary.

On the nose, there were lots of fruity esters upfront ranging from overripe apples with lemon to pears, these were then followed by characters of bananas with a bit of clove spice note.  I found that there was a more noticeable presence of phenol on the taste, getting a spicy peppery note upfront. There was also a noticeable but faint hop bitterness with the peppery taste which then faded a bit to notes of biscuit and caramel in the finish with a slight bitterness from the hops.  This beer was pretty medium bodied and had a high amount of carbonation to it.

37,129,ThaneMcC,4.28,"Bottled date 0f 02Apr2020 Pours lovely cloudy amber with copious white head and ample effervescence. Smell is a little funky, some of those dusty Belgian yeast notes, some citrus and bready notes. Taste is sour up front with sweet malty mid note, some citrus, banana, clove and sweet malts and then transitions to a bitter bite to balance out the sweetness. Mouth feel is medium with strong astringency from the carbonation and palate cleansing – good beer to accompany a greasy burger, heavy fragrant cheese. Overall, a funky version of a Belgian pale ale – you can smell and taste the activity of those wild yeast – but pleasantly balanced – I’m not a fan of sour beers, but I found this one to be quite pleasant.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,unlikelyspiderperson,4.41,"Bottle is about 11 months old. Bottled 4/25/2019, bought out of the store fridge. The elegant bottle unleashes a deep amber liquid with a slight haze to it that probably used to stand out but now looks like most American ipas. Crowned with a majestic coif of solid soapy foam fed by lots of active carbonation. The massive cloud sits comfortably atop the beer as long as you'll let it, leaving thick lacing when it does, begrudgingly let go of the edge of the glass. The nose is wild and tangy with hoppy lemon notes over a funky acidity. Grapefruit and tulsi tea and that distinct dusty barn dry brettanomyces smell. Taste is pleasantly musty with a little dry acidity. White grapes and underripe persimmon are there for me too. After dumping in the last few ounces with the dregs a distinct breadiness shows up that rounds out the flavor nicely. Mouthfeel is very prickly with carbonation and pretty thin. Overall this is a nice change of pace beer that was/is a pleasure to drink. No question its earned its status as a classic and with so many new money breweries trying their hand and kettle sour/mixed ferm pale ales this one really shows up",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

A slightly rocky head and a dense aroma which becomes disappointingly overwhelmed with bitterness as soon as the first wisp of citrus on the nose has finished.

Aroma is bready pale malt with fruity esters of banana, pear and white grape. Taste is a little odd in that it exhibits a saison like sourness, bitter finish and a lingering bitter aftertaste unlike other Belgian pale ales I've experienced. These are wrapped around a much thinner version of the nose with the addition of Belgian candy sugar. Good enough to get a 4 rating but a little odd since this beer receives too many high ratings and has long been recognized for its quality. My example was almost a year old (June 2011) to the day with a ""best by""date of 2016 so unless the bottle was mishandled the flavor should be true. I had this a year or two ago and remember it being better than this.

37,129,JonnoWillsteed,3.94,"It's bottle-conditioned, and I suggest pouring with great care. The 330ml bottle had been in the fridge resting for a couple of days, and despite carefully pouring down the side of a pint glass, by the time I had 1Cm in the bottom, the glass full on top with foam. It took 3+ minutes of very slow pouring and not putting the bottle down to fully decant it! L- Dark amber, slightly cloudy (some final sediment lifted very easily at the end) with a vast pillowy cream coloured head that's gradually receding. S- There is a little spiciness to this, coriander for one thing. T- It's flavour-packed, and dryer in the finish than I'm used to from a Trappist ale. M- I've rechecked the lable twice now, 'Yep, just 6.2%!' It's quite surprising that it manages to pack such a hefty punch from 'just 6.2%'. That it manages it without faking body via rich/sweetness is doubly so. O- Could this be one of the few (?) Trappist ales that you could almost session? a) it's not a wildly high ABV% b) it's dry finish means the palate doesn't get too worn out with richness. Though C) Well maybe over in Belgium at their more reasonable local prices. Here in the UK it ain't cheap. Bought from Harvey Nichols (dept store) £3.50/330ml.

The aroma give you the smell of tropical fruits and apricot.. The taste was very rich and fill your mouth with some sour/sweet fruity taste that also you get very well apricots and there.. But the most greater thing of this beer is the aftertaste and perhaps is the best i have get from any beer.. The aftertaste is endless and has three steps..

It was bottled on 12/20/2018 with a best by date of that in 2023; ordinarily I'd include this in the cellaring forum but I'll save that for when I try one around the best by date.  Poured into a long stemmed Lost Abbey tulip the prodigious head required multiple small pours even of the 330. The body color was a dark more brownish amber. The smell was a complex citrusy grassy and earthy combination giving me a heads up that something special lies ahead. The taste just describes description because there's so much going on between the malts, hops and yeasts that as soon as you think you have it nailed down you taste something else. Mouthfeel was fine for the style.  For a relatively low alcohol ale this is extremely interesting.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Smell and taste are nice, sweet bread and caramel malt, candy sugar, and interesting tones from the yeast and hops. A bit of Brettanomyces or other wild yeasts in the mix, plum and cherry and citrus peel and some spicy/earthy qualities.  Feels well balanced, medium bodied with lively carbonation and a dry finish. Complex and subtle flavors and feel develop as I sip.  Overall a very nice and unique beer! Glad I finally got to review it.

37,129,beergoot,4.25,"Clear amber hued body sporting a thick head; dense and lasting foam with sticky and clinging fingers of foam. A nice citrus aroma; lemon; some brett; spicy; anise. The taste is a unique blend of gentle malt sweetness, fruity esters, and a touch of phenolic wild yeast; some decent hop bitterness to offset the semi-wild and pit fruit flavors. Medium body; rather dry overall with some hop bitterness and phenol bite.  This beer brings some intriguing sensory qualities to the palate. On top of that, all its quirky and unique qualities magically blend together into an appealing taste treat. The beer balances otherwise independently strong qualities of dryness, fruitiness and sweetness, and a subtle yeast wildness into a unified and very approachable beer product. Words can't do justice to the character of this beer, so my best suggestion is to just try it. Chances are you'll be glad you did.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,MonDak_Joe1953,4.49,"330ml brown bottle. Label has 'BOTTLED ON 17/05/2018' and 'BEST BEFORE 17/05/2023'. Cloudy, orange amber colored body. Takes a few pours to fill the glass, because of the tall eggshell colored head that forms. The big bubbles dissipate quickly, and leave a pillowy, fine bubble cap and a ring that climbs up the sides of the glass. Not much lacing is left behind from each sip. Aroma is big on Belgian yeast and spices, with a orange/lemon citrus contribution. Some bready malts also. Taste is a combination of the funky yeast (dry grassy barnyard), orange/lemon citrus, and the thick bready malts. Rather dry at the end, and the yeast funk and the malts trail off in the aftertaste. Medium plus mouthfeel, with lots of effervescence on the tongue and in the mouth. The texture is a little chewy, and the trail off is dry. Quite an enjoyable drinking experience, from the dramatic billowy head appearance and color in the glass, to the yeast led aroma and taste, which is tempered a little by the citrus. The malts form a solid foundation. The hops are subtle in expression and contributes to a mellow bitterness. After each sip the beer fades away with a dry yeast/malt tone.

As it warms a subtle nuttiness emerges along with a stronger nose of dark fruit.  That signature Trappist yeast is present along with a subtle astringency that is present but not overwhelming.. a light acidity from the citrus peel flavors works to balance everything well. A lighter beer than expected, with a surprising minerality and grassiness in the finish. Finishes with some grain, caramel notes.

37,129,Snowcrash000,4.75,"I will be doing this review in the form of a side-by-side comparing the 2021 to the 2019 vintage. They were both bottled in early January and are almost exactly 24 months apart, with the 2021 being around 13 weeks old at time of consumption. The score represents both vintages, as I loved them both equally.  Upon pouring, the coloration is very similar, a cloudy dark amber, which is perhaps a little more deep for the 2019, with some carbonation bubbles being evident in both as well, with both also managing a large, foamy head despite a very careful pour, although head retention is noriceably better for the 2021 vintage, which also leaves tufts of wispy lacing on the inside of the glass that are not present with the 2019.  When it comes to the aroma, as expected, the 2021 is a lot hoppier and fruitier, with some light doughy malt and distinct citrus notes and lighter herbal accents, as well as hints of estery fruit and spice, with some accents of apple and clove. The 2019 has a lot sweeter, maltier aroma to it, with very little hop aromatics, although the estery fruit and spice is a lot more evident, with the apple, clove, as well as some wet hay and hints of musty funk standing out a lot more here without the hops muscling in.  The taste very much follows the nose, with the 2021 being a LOT more hoppy and bitter, with very little sweetness or funkiness coming through, although the esters manage to show through here already, particularly with some spicy accents of clove and black pepper, but hints of green apple and hay as well, while the citrus notes of grapefruit, lime peel and lemograss really dominate this, with lighter alpine herbs as well. The 2019 is much sweeter, with the doughy, slightly grainy malts being more in the foreground here, although hints of bitter, zesty hops still manage to poke through here, but the estery, slightly funky notes of tart green apple, pear and lighter gooseberry, as well as quite distinct clove and lighter black pepper are much more prominent here, while is a mild, musty funkiness with a certain blue cheese character being present as well.  The body and mouthfeel is very similar for both, although the 2021 feels perhaps just a tad more lively carbonated, while the 2019 is a little bit more flat, although this may all well be my imagination based on expectations, In any, case, the differences are minimal here.  Overall, while the differences were certainly predictable, it's still fascinating how much a beer like this can change over two years, with the 2021 feeling a lot more hoppy, bitter, refreshing and easy-drinking, while the 2019 is distinctly maltier and more estery and funky, feeling a bit more refined, complex and richer. I can honestly say that I loved them both equally, with the 2021 feeling more like a classic Belgian Pale Ale, while the 2019 has almost aged into more of a Saison-esque beer, but they are both fantastic in their own way, with each containing shadows of its counterpart within it. Actually, as I finish these glasses, while the difference and shift in flavor profile is very evident here, it's not quite as massive as I had imagined and I'm very much looking forward to doing this again next year with a 3 year old bottle versus a hopefully fresher bottle that is less than 2 months old.  UPDATE: I just had the opportunity to try Orval at 1 and 36 months old and while the observations from my review above remain unchanged, I thought that it was interesting that the differnce between the 1 and 6 months old bottles almost seemed more significant than the difference between the 6 and 36 month old bottles, with the 1 month old bottle being a LOT more hoppy and bitter than the 6 month old bottle while the 36 month old bottle really wasn't as much more rich and funky, yet has started to develop some light oxidation, which also made me realize that 2 years is probably the cut-off point for me when it comes to Orval, while I really enjoyed the 1 month old bottle the most.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,joe1510,4.31,"330ml $5.99 Prisco's Market - Aurora, IL  Bottled: 4/27/16  Orval looks exactly like what it is, your classic Belgian pale ale. The body leans amber with a caramel hue. Tiny bubbles rush to the surface from every spot of the glass which bolsters the amazingly creamy, silky smooth foam. That head bubbles up immediately on the pour like Alka Seltzer. The foam is going nowhere anytime soon and will be sitting over a finger high when the entirety of the beer is gone. This beer looks just about perfect.  Ah, yes. The nose is wild and wonderful. Damp stone with a slight metallic edge start it off. There are gobs of wildflowers present, handfuls of dandelions. A doughy malt base whispers in the background while musty pear and green apple bring more depth to the middle. As amazing as that foam looks and holds on, it is a little detrimental to the nose, squashing it a bit.  The flavor is big, bright and vibrant. Soda bread with a drizzle of caramel make up the base. Green apple and pear pop up in the middle and push through the finish along with that wildflower accompaniment. That pear and apple get musty closer to the finish, which is pretty appetizing. A touch of spicy booze on the finish wraps it up. Good depth and flow. Not as wild as the nose suggested.  The feel is up there as only the best of the Belgians can seem to manage. It's immediately frothy and airy as it hits the tongue which adds on overall lightness, obviously. There's enough prickliness to the bubbles that they seem to awaken the tongue. A quick flash of acidity runs through and leaves its mark. The finish dries out slowly and leaves you wanting more. This is maddeningly easy to drink.  Oravl is a classic for a reason. It's funky and unique stepping out of the box when it comes to the other Trappist Breweries. This one is all its own. It's bright and well rounded with a bit of funk and a whole bunch of character. This beer needs to be in my fridge much more often.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Steve_Studnuts,3.28,"This is really quite magnificent on the pour; GIGANTIC fluffy white head that slowly dissipates. Had to pour three times to fit the entire 11.2 ounces into your standard pint glass. The beer itself looks like really cloudy apple cider (not the hard variety). My positive impressions stop there, however. The nose is just rough on this one. Lots of off scents; cat piss being the most egregious and repugnant. Tastes a little better than it smells, thankfully, but there's still something off-putting on the backend. I can't quite put my finger on it. This particular bottle was filled on 04/06/2015 and I'm guessing that has something to do with it. Belgians may typically age well, but a dusty grocery store shelf under constant fluorescent lighting probably isn't the optimal condition for doing so. Very disappointed (I love a good Belgian), but I'll have to sample this again before writing it off completely.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Careful to not disturb sediment, so only a little hazy.  S: sweet, bubblegum, pale malt, floral and green noble hops.  T: arrives drier and less phenolic than I would have expected. Significant pale malt presence, clean and crisp, followed by a strong green hoppy bite. Quite medicinal, green, stemmy, floral. Refreshing with only a hint of funk. With sediment: smoother, more phenolic, more tart. I liked it better without.  M: crisp, lighter side of mid weight with very high carbonation. Quite drinkable. Slicker and heftier with sediment; likes it better without.  O: interesting beer; I suppose I was expecting something more like Ommegang’s Rare Vos only better. This is a distinctly hoppy beer, with noble hops driving and Belgian yeast phenols pulling up the rear. Can’t say I’m in love with it. Reminds me of Duvel and Sorachi Ace.

My biggest issue with the beer, the mouth feel is completely wrong for a trappist, it feels thin, that milky mouth feel is non existent.

The beer pours bright orange amber in color with tight khaki colored head. The head recedes to a thin cap but leaves no lacing. The aroma is yeast driven primarily with some hints of clove. The taste is sharp and grassy with little malt character. The hops are nearly gone and the yeast flavors of funk, bitter pineapple and barnyard are dominating.

Tons of carbonation rushing up from the bottom of the tulip glass.  Smells sweet bready, yeasty, faded lemon, very balanced and overall subtle.  Taste is so balanced. A sweet breadiness almost like hawaiian sweet roll followed by a yeasty fruitiness that is very mellow, maybe some mellowed out lemongrass and earthiness.  Pleasant mouthfeel with medium to high carbonation, medium to light viscosity and a nice lasting yeasty note that finishes with just a touch of dryness.  I think the excellence of this trappist ale lies in its balance and drinkablilty.

Great retention and some lacing S — Green apple, tart cherry, barnyard funk, sour grape, musk, sweet doughiness, caramel T — Not at all sour, but has a very interesting yeasty funkiness to it. Very earthen and ‘damp’. Getting some bready malts, floral, and maybe a hint of grassy hops as well F — Dry. Intensely effervescent, which makes the mouthfeel suffer a little. This is one of those beers that even after releasing a large amount of CO2 during the pour, there is still enough left so that a small sip not immediately swallowed turns into an unpleasant mouthful of foam. Probably caused by the bottle conditioning O — Certainly one of the more unique Belgians.

Hints of the malts and spice, but quite subtle. Champagne-like carbonation, and a medium body. Alcohol heat lingers.

Aroma is definitely on the sour side of the spectrum, but you do get plenty of fruits, fig, banana, spiced apple.  Taste is not quite as rewarding, it has an artificial aspect, which sticks in the throat during the aftertaste. ABV is on the low side for this style of beer too.  I'm picking holes, it is a good beer, just not quite hitting the mark for me.

Nose: sweet, olive, honey, sherry, ripe peaches. First impression is pleasently dry, very lively, followed by an alcoholic and bitter finish. Aftertaste is herbal and longlasting.

Mild sweetness rapidly kicked down by citrus rind, hay, and mild tartness. Hopping is present for bittering and aroma... really brings this back to earth.

37,129,Lone_Freighter,4.1,"Bottle to tulip, the appearance was a fairly murky red to brown sort of color with a two finger's worth of rocky foamy head that glistened and slid off at a good pace. Lace was somewhat thick and foamy and sticky. The aroma had a swift sweet to funky barnyard hay/grassy whiff. Roamed nicely into some basement stiffness and had some floral particles coming out to play with a little bit of a brisk earthiness. The flavor was odd, well, it had that vinous quality that seemed to want to pummel the funk, but in reality, it didn't. So in turn, the earthiness, basement, and floral hop quality played a good part in and all around. Aftertaste seemed to cherish the funk and embrace the wine quality. The mouthfeel was about medium bodied, maybe a touch under with a good sipping quality to it due to the wine harshness. Carbonation felt fine, maybe a bit high, but I gave it a ""restrained pour"" to assist in the containment. ABV felt good.

A really crisp and ’green’ taste, with a nice hop-bitter after taste; very well-balanced F - nothing of note. Not watery. Not syrup-y. A nice sparkly carbonation like those in sparkling wines.  O - this is my favorite beer to date, period, and the beer that got me interested in craft beer. Upon first serve it smacks you in the face with how different it is, without being over-the-top. It is well balanced in its farmhouse qualities and its beer-y/hoppiness, and I haven’t really found any other beer that I have gotten so smitten about. It is the countryside in a glass.

Bottled on 15/12/16  Appearance: Pours a mysterious hazy orange, nearly an amber with a thin head and beautiful lacing that clings in fine wisps.  Aroma: Scent of the usual belgian yeasts, clove banana bubblegum - along with a slight funk that makes Orval what it is, hints of the sea and grass.  Mouthfeel: Unbelivable moutfeel unlike any of the other Trappist ales, but is closest to St Bernardus Tripel, fine carbonation whose articulation dances in the creaminess of it all.  Taste: Lighter than the usual suspects in the style, but with such nice herbal, sea salt, floral notes as to give it something none of the others do. Its funk reminds me of a saison, but its fullness tells you its a trappist belgian pale ale. Along with the herbal notes comes hints of citrus and pepper which close it off.

Aroma: Excellent - pleasant and nuanced. Medium intensity balancing towards sweet. Malty notes include faint caramel and toffee with biscuity pale malt. Floral, spicy, and citrusy hops.

Slightly peppery as well as tart. The finish is balanced and a tad dry.  Mouthfeel: Very enjoyable. Medium-light body with perfect carbonation. Slightly drying and prickly with a hint of warmth.  Overall: A very impressive beer demonstrating excellent craftsmanship. The ABV is hidden and no unacceptable off-flavours come through. I had this beer just short of two years ago when I was first getting into beer. Back then I didn't have the appreciation I have for it today. If you haven't tried it yet, I say it's worth it.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Bdubz94,4.3,"Excited for this one-- hear it is unique among Trappist beer.  Poured from a 12oz bottle bottled on 12/8/15 (good until 12/8/20). Fridge temp. Into a snifter.  Wow. Hello foam! Even with a delicate pour, you are going to get a HUGE head--probably the biggest I have ever seen on a bottled beer. The beer is crystal clear at fist but hazy once the whole bottle is poured. A lovely medium amber hue. Head recedes very slowly, so get comfy while pouring. Heavy lacing like none I have seen before. Just such a foamy, frothy beer. There is a head until the last sip.  Upon cracking the cap off, I am met with the aroma of spices. Very spicy, very yeasty, slightly fruity (apples, pears), slightly funky.  Taste is spicy, yeasty, floral and slightly malty with hints of apple and pear.  Feel is crisp, dry, and light with medium carbonation.  Overall a very unique beer-- like none I have had before. This likely due to the unique yeast used. I definitely recommend trying this one.

Flavor is just as complex: yeasty spice and fruit with wet hay earthiness. Medium full body with lively carbonation and a refreshing slightly dry finish. Overall this beer is absolutely great but very different from what is expected of a Trappist ale. The addition of Brett produces an enticing funky and sour aroma and flavor that pairs well with the more common Belgian spicy, fruity yeast.

37,129,FBarber,4.44,"Pours a cloudy, pretty much completely opaque light russet color. Huge pillowy off-white head forms on the beer even with the gentlest of pours. As it settles down it forms this velvety pillow of foam. Aroma is a lot fruitier than I remember this being - but this is also a much fresher bottle than I've had the last few times. There are some yeasty notes with strong fruity esters. The Brett still comes through with some funky barnyard notes but even the Brett is on the fruitier side.  Taste follows the nose with a complex flavor profile throwing a bunch of different things at you all at once - there is the Brett, obviously, fruity, tart, funky and a bit of wet blanket - there is also the spicy yeast notes with white peppercorn, and then there is some graininess with some lighter hop notes on the back end providing a certain bitterness. Its one of the most interesting beers I've ever had and I kind of love how no two bottles are really ever the same while still being the same beer. Feel is light to medium bodied, bright, vibrant and vivacious. Somewhat dry on the finish.  Overall its a delight to drink this beer anytime I get the chance. I really need to do a side by side with a fresh bottle and an aged bottle one of these days. ___________________  Pours a bright orange color. Partially opaque. Huge frothy head dissipates slowly but steadily leaving thick lacing and a residual half finger layer of pillowy white foam. Lovely appearance.  Smell is tart and vinegary - yes you get tartness on the aroma that gets your taste buds revving from that brett. Some bready malt is there as well as a nice belgian spicy yeast aroma. Interesting because this bottle has lots of brett on the nose.  Taste has notes of bread, vinegar, floral hops, touch of bitterness. The brett is present. but not nearly as present as the nose would have implied.  Feel is light and drinkable. Very dry finish. Mild carbonation.

Feel was very light and highly carbonated, which was different for a Trappist Ale for sure. Beer has a little aftertaste but finishes dry, much like champagne.  Overall this is a good beer, however the other trappist brewed beers are better IMO.

Head retention is great with fantastic lacing. Aroma is dark fruits, cherry, with a little lactic sour at the back. Flavor profile is dark fruits, tart cherries, Belgian yeast spice, with a slightly sour finish. It's a balanced and tasty flavor profile. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a filling, slightly grainy texture. Overall, a robust Belgian ale that showcases all of the stand-up characteristics of the style.

37,129,thebeers,3.79,"Dark orange, highly effervescent, with an overly massive airy white head that leaves thick, lumpy lacing.  Nice fruity, sour, dry aroma, with plum skins most prevalent. Maybe a hint of sour apple and pear as well. Smells delicious.  Unfortunately, it's very yeasty, dry and flat tasting. The sourness I loved in the aroma sort of lurks in the background, and there's just a little of the fruitiness (plum, Apple, and now maybe lemon) behind that. I understand this beer changes considerably with age. This seven-month old bottle doesn't seem at its prime. Clearly there is something special underneath here, but it's masked.  For a beer that required me waiting a very good while for the head to die down, it also has a surprisingly still mouthfeel. Dryness is the dominant quality.  In a world before sours became ubiquitous, I could see this being a cult favorite, but the dry yeastiness cuts into the enjoyment for me.

A nice citrus, lemon and floral hops with a wet straw/grass funk. Good amount of yeast, banana, clove and some light spice to finish it off. Light bodied with nice carbonation.

Hazy, lively bubbles, and a thick two or three white head that shrinks fast, but stays about a finger thick and leaves plenty of lacing. Absolutely beautiful in the glass! Smell is earthy, slightly funky, and a touch of grassy hops, not what I expected from a Trappist pale, but wonderful, for sure. Taste follows suit with the earthy yeast more at the center, transitioning well to a slight touch of sweetness and then a touch of bitter grassy hops and a wonderfully dry finish. Feel is smooth and fluffy, medium body, lively but not distracting carbonation. Overall, great in many ways, but especially in its uniqueness.

Thick sediment patches the bottom of the bottle.  Distinct aroma here - green apple, pear, white wine, fruit vinegars, and wet hay on bready malt. The taste follows, bringing musk, boozy esters, and punches of bitter lemon rind. The mouthfeel is akin to champagne - tight carbonation and a tongue-chewingly dry finish.  Definitely a palette-tester, and, I imagine, not for everyone. Orval really shows the variety of Belgian ales, and how futile it is to shepherd them into distinct categories.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,911CROFT,3.7,"330ml bottle into the appropriate Orval branded chalice. Paid £2.49 for a single. Bottled: 18/08/15  Pours a hazy, but translucent, brassy-copper coloured body with only a few solitary microscopic carbonation bubbles visible. A two-finger in height, thick, creamy, off-white head with excellent retention, slowly sinks to a dense cap, leaving solid bands of sticky lace.  The complex nose is led initially by delicate fruity and spicy esters. Banana, lemon, green apple and coriander are noticeable above a sweet, crisp and bready pale malt background. After warming, tart and funky Brett characteristics become much more prominent, evolving towards a wilder profile and relegating both fruit and malt to supporting roles. Towards the back end, floral hops provide a modest but perceptible bitterness, with grassy, herbal and musty profiles also noticeable but to a lesser extent. Taste roughly follows suit, leading briefly with hints of sweet, grainy pale malts, lemony citrus, apple, white grape, cherry and stone fruits, quickly transitioning towards tarter and funkier profiles. Apple cider vinegar, wet hay and hints of medicinal phenolic spices comprise the majority of the mid palate, before hop bitterness begins to build. In the mouth a light body and abundance of lively, expansive carbonation give a smooth and full feel. Towards the back end, assertive floral, grassy and spicy hops provide a lengthy bitter finish, drying the palate with mild astringency.  Overall this is an excellent beer. Infinitely complex and undoubtedly unique, it’s a classic for good reason. Cellared for 14 months, the flavours imparted by brettanomyces in this bottle were funkier and tarter than I honestly prefer. To my taste it is best drunk reasonably fresh; the flavours are sweeter, brighter and less musty, but each to their own. I’ll certainly look to re-review next time I am able to pick up a fresh bottle.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

And I have to agree. The smell is fruity and it really reminds me strawberries, maybe cherries and possibly wine. The taste is actually quite bitter. Other than that is reminds fermented fruit. One can feel the alcohol quite well considering it only has 6.2 % ABV. However, it mixes well with the aroma and overall feel. The foam tastes disgusting though.

37,129,ichorNet,4.36,"Ah, one of the eternal greats of Belgian brewing, Orval. Not sure what more there is to say about this classic than has already been said, but I'll try to add my thoughts in a meaningful way. Bottled September 25th, 2014, so it's almost 2 years old. This is probably the oldest bottle of Orval I've had yet, so I'm excited!  Pours a phenomenal deep amber hue with absurd, climbing — towering, even! — head that just fails to relent throughout each small pour. Needless to say, this is a gorgeous beer with a remarkable appearance. The foamy cap is so thorough that I can barely get 9 ounces into my 12 ounce glass, as the rest of the vertical space is reserved for the Brett-induced bubble eruption. No clarity is apparent, as is logical with the use of such a well-defined yeast strain. Lace is spotty but not exactly required in the style regardless.  Nose is funky with green apple, white grape must, rustic notes, baking spice, pie crust and earthy/herbal and floral hop elements. A beautifully strong and distinct smell that also comes across as slightly fragile and delicate as well. There's an excellent balance here, obviously based on creating the same beer (and only that one beer!) for nearly a century. I'm getting some slight ethanol notes as well, which makes sense as this is probably slightly stronger than the ~7% it's marked as due to Brett yeast conditioning over the course of two years since bottling.  Palate is delightfully earthy, spicy and funky with some definite green apple skin, dry white wine notes and sweaty (weird description but it works, trust me... not a bad thing at all!), rustic aspects as well. I even get a slightly tannic flavor and some fruity candy like notes as well. A very slight acidity comes across on the tongue, too, perhaps a result of the long bottle conditioning. White pepper, tart and doughy yeast and an almost ""Saison-like"" dryness finish out each sip.  Feel is perfectly balanced between effervescent and chewy, with an adequate yet massaging carbonation and rather dry finish that combines all of the flavors perfectly. Ethanol is mildly apparent, but serves only to help savor the experience. I will definitely buy more moderately-aged (bottle says best before 2019) Orval soon. Though it's a pretty expensive single bottle, it is a world-class Belgian Trappist product that deserves its high ratings.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Aroma: reminded me of good sparkling wine, fruity and floral, red apple skin and perfume. Not strong, but delicate.  Taste: similar to the aroma, tasted like white sparkling wine, sour golden raisins and something similar to a fruity minty flavour.  Mouthfeel: crisp carbonation that makes for a medium bodied mouthfeel with a champagne-like bitter aftertaste.

37,129,davidperez,5,"Served in a St. Bernardus chalice, it pours a deep and dark orange, tilting towards brown. It forms a three-finger head with excellent retention, ecru, foamy and sudsy. After a while the head diminished, yet a one-finger remnant head is perennial. The lacing in this beer is thick and intricate.  The bouquet is so intense that it imbued the atmosphere with dried fruits as soon as I opened the bottle. While observing the beer, the aromas still reached my senses. This is a young Orval, and yet a clear and distinct funk is there… all hail Brettanomyces! Barnyard, horse blanket, wet hay. Those are the most predominant aromas, yet there are also some dried fruits, overripe apple and pear, clove. So unique and enticing.  The depth of this beer has no paragon. It introduces itself with a high carbonation that teases your palate. Right after, a strong, complex and predominantly bitter flavor, that follows the nose zealously. The farmyard notes and clove are the strongest flavors, followed closely by the dried and overripe fruits, which resemble undertones. I am enamored by Orval's finish. It enters so subtle and yet so assertive; right after the aggressive flavors fade, a fruity, herbal note rises and lingers, sweet and long. The last sensation in your mouth, though, is that of dryness. Medium body, slightly velvety and smooth.  I just found a new favorite.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,Bierliebhaber3,4.29,"This Belgian pale ale pours a not so pale, slightly opaque orange tinted caramel color with a massive white foamy head that has some serious retention. The smell is amazing and complex with elements of fruit including pear, apple, and citrus, flowers, a bready caramel malt scent, and yeast. The flavor is incredibly well balanced and very pleasant. The fruit flavors are not as strong as I would have guessed from the scent, but they are still very much present. With apple and citrus coming through the most and blending nicely with flowery elements. These flavor brings to mind the first day of spring. There is a very solid malt backbone that imparts a sweet caramel and brown bread flavor and serves to give the beer a body that is on the high end of medium. Flavors of yeast and herbal hops also come through particularly in the aftertaste. The beer finishes semi-dry. I often forego the Belgian pale ale for the higher alcohol Belgians (strong ales, triples, quads, etc.), but this beer has reminded me why I shouldn’t always skip this style.

Feel - Medium bodied, good carbonation level but more coating than prickly, dry mouthfeel not astringent.  Overall - This is such an underrated beer that is widely available that i'm also guilty of continually passing on, in my opinion the yeast is such a great twist and really helps the drinkability and experience.

37,129,Beginner2,4.31,"This is a complicated beer to review. I've Had Orval at least nine times and, now, try to overhaul my review. But in reviewing the pros below, I am so humbled that I will forego the BA format and instead share the best of the books I still study.  ""Michael Jackson's Great Beers of Belgium"" reviews Orval for 7 pages. (This length has no rivals, certainly for just one beer.) MJ gives a great summary of Orval and its role in brewing culture. MJ gives too many highlights to quote. But a Highly Recommended read for ale students and Orval fans alike. MJ's 1999 ""guide"" gave Orval 4 of 4 stars (I'm sure less than 2% of the beers in this book get the full 4.) And despite the book's pithy format, MJ also gave Orval the book's longest review. And while MJ never stated his ""favorite"" beer during the course of his career, he once responded to that question saying that Orval was ""quintessential."" Perhaps that is enough to win the crown.  Reviewed also in Roger Protz' CAMRA classic ""300 Beers To Try Before You Die!"", he gives a detailed treatment of Orval's taste and history.  Orval also reviewed in the ""1001 Beers To Taste Before You Die."" Orval obviously deserves to be on the list and the review is worth a read. The reviewer makes the point that many think that no two bottles of Orval are the same because it travels badly, but that the ale ages well.  As for me, I had Orval at various intervals and have enjoyed it most at 2&1/2 years before its five year Best By cycle. (But I also cannot seem to keep it longer than 30 months in the bottle... and I wish I would as the intense bubbles bother me.) So, the lesson is that if you like malt (as I do), then wait and the bubbles will recede. Like an old friend who is brilliant, I will always welcome Orval. But I suspect the key missing ingredient is my patience.  More important, I went on their website for the first time and it is fascinating. Should I put this monastery on my Bucket List?  1/20/21 I've edited this review. I've said enough about this ale-full-of-grace.

A bit of sweet caramel shows through. Alcohol is noticeable, but not too strong.  Taste: First sip is a bit bitter. The bitterness bite is short-lived as it quickly turns to sour fruit and wine. The alcohol breaks through as well. By smell and taste, you’d think this beer was 8%+ ABV. Next in line are the bread, cracker, wheat, and slight malt flavors.

I didn’t really expect it but it certainly has that malt vinegar mouth puckering flavor to it once sipped. It takes over the banana and toffee notes that I was getting on the nose. The bit of chocolate that I was getting is completely absent on the palate and makes me question if I was even smelling it. It does have a pleasant mouthfeel.    -Rating: 2.5/5: I gotta admit I had high hopes for this one. Definitely not my favorite. I would have liked a bit more banana bready malt to combat the sour.

The taste is primarily bready malt, yeast, lemon peel, and spice, with a hint of sour apple. It is quite dry, sour throughout, and bitter at the finish. I don't taste the banana I smelled and there is only hint of sweet malt. This ale is medium-bodied and highly carbonated; the head and lacing persisted throughout the pour.

37,129,dcotom,3.94,"Poured cold from 11.2-ounce bottle into snifter. Bottle date 15/05/2014.  L - A bit of a gusher upon opening. Pours a cloudy caramel color, with 3-4 fingers of thick, white head despite a rather tentative pour. Quite a bit of lacing.  S - A little yeast funk and citrus at first. Aroma develops as it warms, revealing more of the banana and spice notes.  T - Not as intense as I imagined it would be. The flavors I expected from the aroma, while there, were muted. This may have been due to the carbonation and the rather strong alcohol presence (surprising, since it clocks in at just under 7% ABV).  F - A touch on the lighter side in terms of body. The finish is dry and bitter, with a faint aftertaste mirroring the notes of the aroma.  O - This had nearly two years on it when I purchased it. I would love to try a fresh one, just to see whether the lack of intensity on the palate might have been due to the age of the sample. Still an awesome Belgian Pale.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,vainosuomi,4.07,"Look: Mostly opaque cloudy amber with a foamy off-white head Smell: Green apple, yeast, spice, banana. Very fruity. Taste: Plenty of that apple up front, along with citrus, yeast, and spice. Slightly sour, decent amount of sweet malt, and plenty of bitterness . Bitter/sour finish. Feel: Frothy, plenty of carbonation, medium bodied. Smooth and slightly astringent.  Overall a very good ale. The fruit flavors definitely have the largest profile, but are complemented well by everything else that's going on.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,bark,4.3,"Brewed on June 4th 2015.  The colour is orange-brown (30 EBC), the liquid is clear. The gigantic head is beige and airy with a fine crater; it sinks very slowly leaving lots of thick lacing.  The smell is bitter with lots of herbs and spices. Some alcohol, ripe apples, cherries and red peppers. Hints of stable and gunpowder.  The taste is bitter and alcoholic with ripe fruits, salty crackers, caramel, spices (nutmeg, allspice), and fresh herbs. Passing herbal bitterness and stable notes. Medium to full body. The aftertaste got warming alcohol, smooth caramel, spices (basilica, oregano) and bitter orange juice. The finish is fresh with gunpowder, bitter tea and herbs.  The carbonation is very strong; the long-lived small bubbles are sharp. The liquid is smooth.  A solid classic... I think it would gain on a few years cellaring.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,matcris,4.69,"APPEARANCE: A burnt orange, hazy almost to rust. Foamy off white head for days, and it lingers forever. Carbonation is hard to see even with a flashlight up to the glass. Thick lacing down the glass. AROMA: Almost white wine like. Green grapes, funky, floral...almost smells like hand lotion! Definitely get the yeast in spades. TASTE: A pleasant sourness, lots of white grapes, the yeastiness you'd expect. There are some really nice, unusual flavors in here that I really can't describe or equate to any other beer I've had. This is unique! FEEL: Creamy right off the bat, then the nice amount of carbonation really begins to move the flavor around the mouth. You get a nice drying quality a few seconds in and then that goes away and it returns to that creamy vibe. OVERALL: Probably the most unique beer I've had so far. Hard to describe but I love what i'm getting from it. It's kind of a mystery in some ways.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Dravin,4.57,"Poured from a 330 ml bottle into a duvel tulip. Bottled on date of 17/07/14 with a best by date 5 years past that.  Look -- Pours a deep gold with mountains of fluffy white head that laces the glass beautifully. It generated so much head it took a fair amount of time to pour.  Smell -- Clove, bubblegum, banana, in a word fruity. There is also some barnyard funk coming through on the nose.  Taste -- As the nose it taste fruity and the funk comes through more prominently with a slight addition of band aid. It has a fair amount of bitterness that lingers. There isn't much in the way in sweetness coming through for me. Possibly a consequence of the brett and being bottled in 2014.  Feel -- Lively carbonation and medium body keeps it light on the palate. It's fairly dry, and it would be crisp except for the bitterness.  Overall -- It's a beautiful beer to behold with that deep gold body and pillows of creamy white head. The brett character comes through, my first experience with it, and it's quite interesting. It's a shame it's more expensive or I'd probably see this gracing my fridge in the near future but that's probably a lament for any trappist ale.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Mild grassy hops with a faint hint of yeast and funk also join the party after you give it some time.  A harmonious blend of lemon, honey, and earthy flavors first comes to mind on the palate, followed by some unforeseen fruit in the form of melons, white grapes and some pear. (shoutout to all the pear!) Faint flavors of caramel and pine are also present on the back end.  Medium-light body with explosive carbonation comparable to mineral water.

S - Real fruity smell, like raisins and plums.  T - Upfront tastes are those raisins and plums that you got on the nose. A great sugary start that slowly transforms into a slight sour finish, kind of like a Flanders Red. There's also some toasty malt characteristics. A seriously delicious beer.  F - Smooth.

Look: Absolutely stunning. A glowing and crystal clear amber with three fingers of rocky fluffy white head with tons of little champagne-like bubbles streaming up to the top. The head fades to one finger rather quickly, leaving sticky soapy bubbly lacing around the top of the glass. Smell: Tart citrus, like lemon and lime zest, light and funky wet hay, light colored caramel and candy sugar sweetness, some subtle breadiness. Taste: Funky and fruity, tart and crisp green apples, lemon zest and fresh squeezed lemon juice, sweet and distinctively Brett with the hay flavor, so very floral like fresh cut flowers in the garden, juicy while still dry, no hint of the 6.9% alcohol. The subtle soft breadiness tip-toes ever so lightly with the sweet floral and zesty hops chasing it across my palate. An absolute joy. Feel: Thin and bubbly, like champagne, dry and soft bitterness that plays with the funky Brett and sweet floral hops so nicely. Overall: Wow. So complex yet easy to drink and so fun to review and dissect the flavors. Unique and tasty, did not disappoint.

Flavors dance with a peppery lightness on the palate. As the flavors play out the beer dries out earthy. No hint of alcohol.  Overall: Deceptively light with depth of flavor and complexity.

Gold amber with a soft white blanket that is permanent, and leaves a soft cling on the glass.  This has a fruitier smell than expected, and than I remember the fresher version having, starting with green apple, pear, and bread. The yeast is nicely subdued, with just a hint of spice.  Taste is apple, pear, and closely reminiscent of a fancy soda bread made by my favorite local fine dining establishment. I also get corn, and delicate floral flavors I've not had before and am having a hard time pinpointing. Needless to say its subtly complex, with a little hay and barn coming in as it warms.  Orval-Oud is really exceptionally pillowy, smooth, with good carbonation, and a middle-ground finish that begins leaning semi-dry as it warms.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Got half of the 330 mL Bottle into a 500 mL Tulip before the head was threatening to jump out of the glass. Annoying enough but the fascinating part it that it took around 5 minutes for the head to die down enough that I could pour the rest of the bottle into the glass; there was one clump that lasted the entire 15-20 minutes it took me to drink the glassful! Lots of thick lacing on the glass.  S- Grapefruit, Apple, pear, peach, grapes. A lot of fruit flavours that I did not expect with this Ale! Slight funk mixed in. Absolutely beautiful. A Masterpiece for the nose...  T- The perfect amount of grassy/earthy bitterness followed by the beautiful fruit found in the nose.  M- Moderate yet very active carbonation and a Medium dry body. Excellent drinkability.  O- I'll start by saying that this beer is a one-of-a-kind; an absolute masterpiece.

37,129,ThisWangsChung,4.49,"Re-review of a bottle dated 12/3/15 (!) Time to see what this beer is like fresh!  Pours a clearish copper color. The head is about a bazillion fingers high, with a bubbly, fluffy texture and an eggshell shade. Annoyingly, the retention is pretty damn good. Huge amounts of lacing sticks to the glass, as well.  I expected this beer to be hoppy, but I expected a grassy bitterness from the aroma - not the cornucopia of fresh fruits I'm picking up! I pick up lots of peach, apricot, apples, and white grapes. The brett is young, but is already bringing some subtle earth and funk. This more or less smells like what the archetypal Belgian beer should be.  The flavor is a bit more bitter than the nose suggested, but nothing to ruin the beer. It opens up with a decent grassy bitterness, before transitioning into mid-taste flavors of peach, pear, and apricot. I can just feel this beer's flavor profile transforming every few seconds. I get mild flavors of vanilla cream and caramel on the finish - maltiness in Orval? Say it isn't so! However, due to its 'age', its brett characteristics are buried beneath the hops. Still, the beer is perfectly balanced yet all comes together to form a cohesive whole. Even when the dregs are poured in it still remains endlessly tasty.  Wow, this beer really fills the mouth with its carbonation. It doesn't have a harsh carbonic sting, though. Despite the full feel, it finishes bone dry. Drinkability levels are perfect, simply because it's absolutely wonderful to savor.  This beer is a legend for a very good reason - it's one of the most insanely complex beers ever. Yet fresh, it has a surprising hoppiness to it. Of course, everything remains perfectly balanced. I'd wager this 12/3/15 batch turned out fantastically. If some American brewer hyped this beer up, made it a one-day-brewery-only release, I would still go batshit over it. But it's available in many stores around the country. Methinks I should have bought more than 3 bottles...  4.49/5: Simply put, a masterpiece",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Good dry finish with a good amount of carbonation. Still feels fuller in body than what was anticipated with the amount of carbonation, but still on the lighter side.

The head keeps foaming up and looks very alive, dynamic course bubbles slowly walk up the sides of the glass, exquisite. The beer itself is a pale transparent deep amber gold-straw color with the barest hint of clouding. Healthy carbonation keeps bubbles streaming towards the top.  Smell: A very unique bouquet, dusty, barn-like, moldy and funky, incredibly complex. Spicy tones become more prominent with a peppery coriander and nutmeg hint. Zesty lemon is prominent as well. A lot going on here, I could spend all day picking out components in this beer.  Taste: A medium bitterness accompanies the taste throughout with a moldy-mildew presence. Sour and pungent. The malt character is there but plays second to the funk. The subtle malt body gives a nice underlying backbone and becomes sweet in the drawn out aftertaste. Complex, extremely complex.  Feel: Mouthfeel is light and smooth with a puckering feel from the sourness. Carbonation bubbles up in the mouth. A hint of astringency coats the tongue. Silky almost.

(4.25)  Feel: pretty spry, with a light/medium body; very dry, woody finish. (4)  Overall: lots of different elements to this beer. I'd like to see everything integrated a bit more cohesively. (4.25)  33 cl bottle dated 10/06/11 into a Duvel tulip at cellar temp.  Look: translucent burnt orange with a monster foam head, great lacing. (4.25)  Smell: wildflowers, lemongrass, bubblegum.

(4)  Overall: compared to the fresher version, this does seem a lot more reined in and focused. Despite the identical scores, I prefer this to fresher.

37,129,superspak,4.47,"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 4/15/2013. Pours slightly hazy orange/amber color with a 2-3 finger foamy and fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big lemon, pineapple, cherry, pear, apple, white grape, hay, straw, pepper, grass, toasted biscuit, musty funk, light leather, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of fruity/funky/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and moderate bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big lemon, pineapple, cherry, pear, apple, white grape, hay, straw, pepper, grass, toasted biscuit, musty funk, light leather, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Good amount of yeast spiciness and earthy hop bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pineapple, cherry, pear, apple, white grape, hay, straw, pepper, toasted biscuit, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/funky/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and moderate bready malt flavors; with a great malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Moderate dryness after the finish from the carbonation. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, fairly creamy/bready, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible Belgian Trappist ale. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/funky/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and moderate bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A highly amazing offering all around. I feel this is at it’s best right around the 3 year mark, and this one was getting near to that age.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,SaisonRichBiere,3.44,"Bottled 9-25-2014. Poured into a snifter  Poured clear light amber, super fizzy and bubbly, but as it sat, the head subsided into a nice frothy layer on top.  Smells Brett-funky, woody, grainy, very light citrus zest.  Tastes like thin malt sugars and herbal, muted cola vibe. Grass and hay notes, hints of spices and cider  Feels soft and creamy with some fizz.  Pretty average beer overall. I was hoping for more flavor as it warmed, but it didn't round out. Lots of subtle flavors, but nothing really sticks out and grabs the palate. Did have a ""belgian"" flavor from the spice notes and yeasty funk. A good suggestion for someone looking to get into Belgian beers.  Cheers!",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,cjgiant,3.68,"Bottle dated 3/27/2014 (BB 2019), 1.5 years: Pours a little dirty golden, translucent to hazy, with billowing pillow-like head that is slow to recede. The head rolled slowly, but continued to build a couple seconds after I stopped pouring. Lacing is overall fairly decent in volume, but spotty and soapy.  Nose is mildly tart and slightly yeasty. I actually think it smells a slight bit like a grapefruit soda, one that isn't all sugared up. Maybe I can also see it being lightly wine-like. Some herbal notes come through with warmth, and the yeast scent peaks at me here and there, but never comes through very strong. A warm beer opens some flower-like scents.  Feel actually comes into play with strong carbonation - biting into my tongue just a bit. I do this first because the beer is so carbonated it actually affects the taste, I think. It takes a good 15 minutes in the glass to subside.  Taste starts out almost a little lemon-herb in nature behind the prickly carbonation. Even when the carbonation subsides a bit, there is still a peppery spice bite from somewhere. Warmth also opens up a little bit of a more fleshy fruit note, but one that is muted by the earthy notes that pervade the beer.  I have had this beer before and recall not being a big fan. I've gained a little more appreciation for it after analyzing it, but it still just doesn't quite do it for me.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,Buck89,4.23,"My bottle was packaged on 3/12/15. Poured into a snifter. a fiery amber-orange with a faint haze. A voluminous and somewhat coarse light tan head that lingered, then slowly receded with delicate tracks. The nose had pineapple, lemon, yeast and floral estery notes. The taste was not surprisingly complex, with a grapefruit bitterness out of the gate followed by a funky barnyard sensation. This then morphed into herbal/floral flavors followed by a return of a lemony/citrus bitterness and a faint spice. Dry, phenolic finish. Medium-bodied. I liked it better as it warmed slightly - could drink this all day. Would love to get more and compare as it ages.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

(More info is always better....thx) Served chilled in a tulip. Bottle is unique....like miniature champagne. Poured nice clear reddish-brown. Not much head.  I love the taste.. NOT syrupy sweet, and on the heels of tasting several local 'syrup bombs', this is extra-appreciated. Remarkable mouthfeel on this one...some different flavours. Not sour, but more a more 'mature' malty profile than many highly regarded Belgian tripels and quads. A champagney, bubbly dryness on the throat. Note this beer is tres fresh...but at only 6%abv, I'm not sure how much taste would change or improve with time. This might be my Belgian co-favorite. ...a ying to Rochefort-8 yang. And this is much easier to see as a multi-serving beverage...there aren't very many quality beers that lend themselves to 'sessioning' in Belgium.

37,129,headlessparrot,4.03,"Bottled October 2014. Beer pours an almost reddish, copper colour, fairly cloudy, topped by a tremendous amount of loose head that just keeps growing. Lots of small bubbles visible. Dense lacing that not only sticks to the side of the glass but actually visibly protrudes. Even after most of the head recedes, at leas one enormous island persists like an iceberg.  Smell is sour, yeasty, sweet, slightly metallic. A bit of Christmas spice (cinnamon? clove?). Smells a lot like a lambic, a faro, or maybe even a Flanders Red. Slight pine, caramelized sugars, brown sugars. Green apple, apple skins. Apricot or peach--stone fruits, at any rate. Sour cherries.  Given the intensity of the aroma, the taste is a lot lighter than I expected. More toasted and roasted malt-type flavours than I would have expected as well. Slight sourness, a lot of fruit: apple, apricot, peach. Maybe some pear? A faint metallic twang. Some baking spices and Christmas spices. Clove? Faint banana? Carbonation is high, but manageable and the body is dense without being overpowering.  Delicious. The taste doesn't quite live up to the smell, but delicious. This reminds me of a lot of my very favourite Belgian beers, of all different styles: Rodenbach Grand Cru, Lindeman's Faro. . . . And yet the difference is that this retains a drinkability that a lot of those favourites don't (I could drink three of these; I could never drink three Rodenbachs in a sitting). I don't know that it's a *better* beer than either of those I listed. But it's of a different style, and is more drinkable.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,SitkaSteve,4.46,"This was poured into a tulip. The appearance was a hazy amber to orange color. There was a decently sized creamy rocky head that lasts for a super long time and then once it dissipates leaves some nice stringy lacing. The smell starts off with tart apples, brings on a slight rustic funk and then slides into some nice Belgian spices. The taste remains tart through the apples and then takes on a musty sort of farmhouse sweet funk. The apples take on a sweet persona in the aftertaste and slides into a semi-sweet to musty wet finish. The mouthfeel is about a light to medium on the body with a pretty good sessionability about it. Carbonation ranges on a delicate soft side allowing the tartness to come back and be the focus of the harshness along my tongue. Overall, its a classic because of its unique quality of the tartness. Its world class for a reason. And a stellar one to have with some NY strip steaks. I also personally love it with grilled halibut steaks.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,dd43,4.31,"Orval is a fantastic beer, and is considered world class for good reason. It has earned its place in the pantheon of classic beers. Voluminous head requires a careful pour. Swirling the bottle before cracking it open, even gently, can cause a foam geyser if you aren't careful. Venting the bottle upon cracking the cap is wise.  The head on this beer is massive, dense and craggy like whipped cream. It is intoxicating to gaze upon. The aroma is pure magic. That funky quality is ever present, but without the plastic aroma of lesser brettanomyces applications. Aging this beer will change that character significantly. When young it is quite a bit more floral in the bouquet, likely from a medley of noble hop varieties.  Somewhat darker in color than other Belgian pales, giving you the sense that the malt character is going to be a little more pronounced (and it is). Great yeast aromas, candied sugar in the flavor, and massively carbonated. Finishes very dry, not sweet, almost saison like in that regard.

Taste/Mouth: Sharp carbonation on the tip of the tongue for eye popping refreshment with the sweet,dry,funky and aromatic complexities of this ale battling it out over the tongue to a superb, velvety,crisp and dry finish that left me wanting more.

37,129,thehyperduck,4.73,"330 mL bottle from the LCBO; bottled Jan 15 2015, listed at 6.9% and served at cellar temperature. I totally did not expect to see this one show up locally - the beer selection has really improved in this town over the past couple of years.  Pours a muddy orange-amber colour, topped off with a copious volume of fluffy white head. It's one of those froths that quite literally slowly grows before your very eyes - it looks like some sort of whipped topping, wilting down over an agonizingly long period that exceeds ten minutes. Looks absolutely beautiful. The nose is similarly attractive, boasting a fluid mix of funky, spicy, intensely yeasty aromas; fruity notes such as apple, apricot and lemony citrus; and doughy malt with a touch of caramelized sugar.  I usually find myself to be a little disappointed when it comes to heavily hyped beers, such as Orval, but this one has really lived up to the expectations - it's goddamn delicious, with a lovely mixture of tart and astringent flavours. Some light, grainy malts, caramelized sugar and doughy bread are easily missed, as the funky, leathery barnyard notes from the Brett are what really grab your attention. Not particularly fruity - I am getting a bit of lemon pith and maybe some apricot, banana, and vinous grape, but it finishes with a phenolic, spicy kick and some bitter, leafy hop notes. The aftertaste is totally dry, making it hard to stop yourself from sipping this one quickly. Medium-bodied, with assertive carbonation levels that give this unique pale ale a crisp, prickly mouthfeel. It feels smooth and frothy on the palate; unbelievably refreshing, too.  Final Grade: 4.73, an A+. Orval is a fantastic beer, and certainly one of the best Belgian imports I have had to date. It is undeniably unique-tasting, with a flavour profile that is both mesmerizing, and annoyingly difficult to describe with much accuracy. The Brettanomyces make this one an acquired taste, but if you go into the glass with an open mind, you can safely expect to be blown away. I'm glad I grabbed a couple of extra bottles, but given this one's history of spotty availability (in Ontario) I might need to snatch a few more while I have the opportunity.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,jmasher85,4.23,"God, I hope to G-d I got a bad bottle of this one. It's really well rated, but neither I nor the rest of my Beer Club were particularly impressed. Again, could have been the bottle, and I'll have to try another soon to compare, but of all the Trappist Beers we sampled during our meeting that night (almost all of them), this was one of the worst.  To be fair, it probably had the most interesting and dynamic flavor profile. Stone fruits on the nose, mainly peach and apricot, but kinda moldy smelling. The taste wasn't much different. A lot of slightly rotton and fermented fruit smells in this one. Most peculiar was the metallic aftertaste that only hits you about 5 seconds after you swallow. So bonus points for being a strange and confusing beer that kept us all guessing, but negative points for being a little too odd and possibly off. I may have to revisit this one with a fresher bottle.  EDIT: Okay, that first bottle was clearly a bad one, so my reivew has been updated today after trying this beer again or Orval Day, 3/25/17. To start off, big bubbles, medium body, and an almost crunchy foamy head. Basically, this beer comes off as a combination between a wheat saison and a Belgian blonde. The yeast plays a big part, giving off a lightly horse blanket Brettanomyces scent, with just a touch of lemony, grassy hops. The flavor is milder, but equally delightful with hefeweizen-like aromatic spice and slightly sweet grainy malt flavor, which soon gives way to a dry, champagne-like finish. I wish the dry-hopping had more of an impact, considering how fresh this beer is, but all else in mind, this is a beer worthy of its classic status.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,MrDell,4.99,"26.09.2015  Orval - 3 1/2 months old Belgian Pale Ale - 6.2% - 330ml Bottle - Bottled 03.06.15  Appearance: Amber coloured beer, one finger, fluffy, cloud-like white head - very tightly packed. Leaves nice lacing on glass which then slowly slips away to rejoin the beer in the glass. Very nice looking beer, especially when served in the correct Orval glass (that was designed by the Abbey’s Architect, no less). As I’m coming to the end of the glass, the head is still made up of the tinniest bubbles you can imagine. Bubbles so small that you can barely see them, they are ever so tightly packed. As I swirl the last, probably 15ml of beer in the glass it remains stuck together almost like a fried egg in a frying pan - a sure sign of a quality product.  Aroma: Strong aroma of apples and pears with dry white wine and other acidic sour fruits. The smell is really nice, can’t pull my nose away from the glass. Getting a hint of banana along side the apples and pears as its warming up.  Taste: Hoppy then sour then hops coming on strong again in the finish. A very refreshing beer. This beer is still fairly cold as I poured it straight from the fridge. It’s very unique taste wise and seems to be different every time I try it - which is fairly often. Always thoroughly enjoyable. Love the way the hops are fighting with the sour flavours of the brett yeast all the way from start to finish.  Mouthfeel: Dry, tart and bittering (which doesn’t sound pleasant but absolutely is where this beer is concerned).  Overall: An absolute all-time favourite. If I could only drink one beer for the rest of my life (heaven forbid!), then this might quite possibly be the one, purely because it never fails to surprise and is always familiar yet somehow different. 10/10, no questions asked!    03.10.2015  Orval - 14 months Old Belgian Pale Ale - 6.2% - 330ml Bottle - Bottled 06.08.14  Appearance: I was really surprised by how much the appearance has changed over the 3.5 month old Orval. It has lost a lot of its bright amber colour and is now much paler. Head is not is not fluffy as it was in the younger brew and, although it is covering the surface of the beer completely, the beer can seen through the head when looking from above.  Aroma: The aroma has become stronger, punchier and more acidic. The apple and pears are still present.  Taste: The hop flavour has dropped off a lot but is still dectectable in the finish. The sourness from the brett is now dominating from the start.  Mouthfeel: Dry and slightly tart, as with the younger brew.  Overall: While I am thoroughly enjoying this beer, I have to say I preferred the younger brew but I’m not sure if that’s due to me being extremely tired while reviewing this slightly older Orval. It seems that while I’m not a huge fan of hop forward beers, the hops in the fresher Orval complement the unusual yeast strain, as both fight to dominate the palate.  UPDATE: 16.10.2015 I must have been really tired when I wrote the above review as I’ve ust tried another 14 month old bottle (06.08.2014) and it was amazing. Yes, the brett has become more pronounced over time, making the beer more sour but it’s a beautiful thing. Beer seems less complex but more refreshing at this age - different but equally as good.

I almost feel ashamed now, realizing what a truly great beer this is. Unique yeast notes on the nose have floral and spicy characteristics. The flavor changes from initial taste to the finish, and changes further as it breathes and warms a bit. I don't find it funky in a traditional Brett sense, but it adds another flavor layer that all comes together. Different and special, this is one to go back to over and over.  Edit...just a note that with one year of age, the brett funk makes the nose on this amazing. However, the taste suffers. Overall, I definitely prefer fresh, although I'll try a 3 year vertical next year.  Edit 2...I've had this many times over the past few years and about half the beers just haven't been as good.

I had to be very careful and patient to pour the rest of the beer. Apart from the big fluffy head that took some time to fade, I also appreciated the bright orange/amber colour of the base.  The smell was something I did not expect - it was worth waiting for the head to stabilize. Lime, cherry, raspberry and even some elderberry came out there. Unusual, yet exciting notes.  The taste was along the same line, with more floral notes in the beginning, cherry/berry character all along, and the citrusy part becoming prominent as the beer was getting warmer.  Carbonation is zesty in the beggining, and the feel after the sip is quite dry, due to the dry-hopping process.

Taste- Immediately noticing the funky from the brett which lends to a slightly dry and tart taste. In the middle some acidic fruits show up, especially lemon and orange. Some caramel malt rounds out the finish, along with some honey sweetness.  Feel- High carbonation upfront but a little more mellow in the finish. Medium bodied and very dry and crisp.  Overall- Honestly didn't know what to expect with this and definitely didn't anticipate the Brett aspect. Funky barnyard beers usually aren't up my alley, but this strikes a good balance with some funk upfront but fading to citrus and caramel combine for a crisp finish.

But this beer is both more dry and more tart than others in its category (BPA). It has a really crisp, thin mouthfeel. Surprising for a beer as high OG as this.

Saccharine fruits (strawberry and cherry), but not sweet, just juicy.  T: Outright funk, lightly herbacious and bready, hay, traces of lemon and cherry fruits. Belgian chalkiness/minerality in the middle but mild and appreciable as just another dimension of this complex work. Sour aspect is very mild here, but still around. Dry and even bitter, especially at the end. The first beer I've ever tried to be sour, bitter, and falsely sweet all at the same time.  M: Well carbonated, medium bodied. Lenient astringency.

37,129,LiquidAmber,4.06,"Poured into an Orval chalice. Foams out of the bottle a bit on opening. Pours a hazy coppery amber with a three finger off-white head with good retention and lots of pillowy lacing. Aroma of citrus, green apple, Bretty yeast, vanilla; floral. Flavor is semi-dry, light apple family fruit, light stone fruit, mild citrus, vanilla, Brett style wild yeast funk, Finishes with fleeting fruit and fruit dessert flavors dominated by the wild yeast funk and bitterness; lightly tart and earthy. Medium bodied with sharp, peppery carbonation. A very distinctive Belgian pale ale with a unique wild yeast component. I did not like this when I first tried it many years ago, but now having grown to enjoy saison yeasts and a light touch of wild yeast, I can see its appeal. Although the flavor is dominated by the funky yeast, there are a lot of interesting light and subtle fruit and spice flavors in the background. A bit too dry and funky to be a frequent choice, it was a pleasure drinking this again and understanding why it is a classic.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Mouthfeel: A bit over carbonated, but not the problem. Body: Not watery, but not the problem. Smell: I am not a fan of sours and this smells bitter and sour. Taste: Bitter, sour and very dry.  Overall: Just don't get this one, and I get a lot of things. Will wait another 35 years before trying again- or maybe not.

Beer pours a hazy medium yellow. Very effervescent, a two finger head springs up instantly. Had to wait for it to die down to finish pouring the bottle. Head settles after a while to a thick, clingy, meringue-like head: beautiful.  Aroma: this is as close to a genre-defining Belgian pale ale as I have ever had. Peppery, estery (bananas and cherry), sweet, floral, ever-so-slightly tart: this is a really awesome nose.  Flavor: a little bit of a letdown after the awesome nose, it's still solid and well-sorted. Bitterness hits first, followed by a lightly grassy note with a clean, refreshing finish. Some residual bitterness and a yeasty note wrap it up. Ever-so-subtle funk lurks in the wings but never asserts itself.  Mouthfeel: very well-carbonated. Tingly and a little prickly if held in the mouth a moment before swallowing. Medium-bodied and a bit smooth.  I don't know why, despite being into craft beer for over 14 years, I never tried Orval. I am so glad I finally got around to it. Doesn't dethrone Duvel as my favorite Belgian pale ale, but it is a worthy brew in any estimation.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Tastes bitter, has a refreshing touch, yeast, with a sweeter finish. Carbonation is pretty high, but not too present. Has a warm pleasant finish, gets into balance in the end (less bitterness). Smells much sweeter than it actually tastes. Bitterness is very present at the beginning, sweet yeast and spices add complexity which results in a very adorable mouthfeel.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,e_dawg,4.75,"Pours a cloudy light orange. Some foamy, frothy head which slowly dissipates. A small amount stubbornly lingers. Aroma is candied apples, light citrus notes, cranberries, earthy tones, and graham crackers. Taste is a balanced and enjoyable mix that's initially sour but the sourness quickly mutes, allowing full enjoyment of the flavor. I'm getting some floral notes overlayed with more citrus, bread, and rust. Feel is light and poppy, almost like a champagne. An extremely enjoyable beer that's one of my favorites.  This is based on a 5 month old bottle, but try it aged by a few years for an even more unique Orval experience.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

The aroma is distinctive with sour apple, medicinal, spicy Belgian funk, fruity, and some lemony notes. The taste follows with the Belgian funk and medicinal, fruit, bandaid, also tart then ending with a surprising bitterness. Not sure if it's from lots of hops though. Maybe the yeast? Very unique taste. Effervescent, crisp, light and refreshing. I was surprised by the drinkability. This went down the gullet quickly. I tried this beer in the 1980's and poured it. I liked Chimay but thought the Orval went bad. Nowadays I fully appreciate unique Belgian flavors. This reminds me of Rayon Vert which is good!",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Medium amber with high clarity, slight red tinge.  S – Very strong bubble gum aroma, sourdough bread. Some mild estery fruit follows, red apples and light citrus. Mild Brett character.  T – Yeasty, spicy notes with again some fruity esters and a spritz of citrus. The Brett is evident, but not prominent. Some slight malty sweetness and just the barest hint of some floral hop flavors.  M – Foamy from the carbonation, carries all the way through to the finish. Pretty juicy up front with a champagne-like dryness on the swallow.  O – This is a very fresh, bright, spritzy, spring time in the hills type beer. I really love the aromas, but the rest is not at the same level. A true Trappist beer, so it meets expectations and is very well crafted, but I don’t think it’s the best of that group.

Fruity aroma, some leather and mustiness from the Brett yeast. Spice, apple and a little citrus. Hits with tartness and some sweet in the front, with some hops bitterness, then finishes with sweet malt still with a little bitterness.

37,129,BeerDrinkersWorldTour,3.75,A – A Foggy orange amber colour that starts with a big rocky head which then dies down to a modest fingernail head leaving mild spotty lace as you drink.  S – Sour orange and citrus smells hit me straight off. There are also bready yeast aromas and deep malty smells along with some vinegary alcoholic notes.  T – Sort of sweet sour combination with coriander and mint combined with bread. This beer is odd and complex the main factor in the taste is the sour flavour which leans towards the cider vinegar edge of things.  MF – Dry and I do mean DRY finish. This beer has light body and crisp nippy bite but it finishes like a mouthful of sloe berries.  O – This is very good ale for its type and will be a winner with those who like Belgian Pale ales. I must confess to not being a massive fan of this one myself but it is doing what it set out to do and it is doing it well therefore I have to give it a mark to reflect that.,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

The taste is bright and crisp with a clean floral caramel sweetness that sharply contrasts the tart herb of thyme and prickly carbonation. Almost even a little cinnamon warmth there, but ever so subtle. A dank redwood taste builds with molasses and earthy moss. Mouthefeel is good and balanced, but the lovely protein that caused the head also gave me a couple gross sips that just felt like biting through fat. Overall a great Belgian.

Aroma was of dried fruits, light phenolic banana, and a yeasty brown bread. Flavor was quite complex. Dried fruits were replaced by stone fruits up front with barnyard (I get it now...), finishing with some spice. Very enjoyable, complex Abbey Ale.

As the beer warms up different flavor profiles are unmasked. Nose welcomes with a pungent bouquet of flowers, lemon zest, juniper spice, yeasty/musk. The flavor profile is just as complex and inviting. Overall, its very dry and tart from start to finish, but the lingering dryness further enhances the flavor profiles. Welcomes you in with a nice sweet caramel and then you get consumed by a unique yeasty musk which later fades into a cider like tartness.  Unbelievably complex. At first the musk might seem abrasive...leading you to question if things can turn around...and oh yes it does! The seemingly abrasive nature sets the stage allowing the flavorful subtle qualities of the yeasty phenols and citrus zest to shine. Very unique. Truly exceptional.

The head dissipated into a cap that left behind a moderate amount of lacing.  Aroma: Wild yeast dominates the nose, followed by some lemon zest and a touch of earthy/grassy notes.  Taste: There's a nice combination of big, musty tartness and light, citrusy sweetness all the way down, with a decent amount of bitterness rounding everything out in harmony.  Palate: This is a medium bodied beer with a healthy amount of carbonation. The aftertaste was musty, earthy, and lightly bitter. The aftertaste isn't intense, but it lingers for a good amount of time.  Overall: I love this beer! The flavors aren't intense, but they all balance each other out well.

Different from any of the other Trappist Ales, even to my less than perfect nose (I often don't smell the same things that appear in many reviews)  Taste of muscadines, sweet at first, develops over time into something even more pleasant. Reminded me of sweeter local vineyard wines than any other beer before.  One of the best mouth feels I have tried. Dry, and smooth, with a very rich full body. Nothing harsh, and only the afterglow lets you know there is more than the usual alcohol here. American Extreme brewers could take a lesson here. Doesn't smack you around.

Slightly hazy, orange color with a large, frothy white head. The head on the beer lasts forever and leaves a fair amount of lacing on the glass.  Strong floral aroma mixed with orange, pear, and lemon. Biscuit malt, hay, musty yeast. The flavor seems to change with almost every sip. Medium-bodied and a chalky - almost metallic - finish.

Smell: Strong canned-pumpkin-candy esters; deep undertones of alcohol floating to the surface, bubbling into atmosphere (ABV is 6.9).  Taste: Contrasting with the sweet smell, the taste is sour with brettanomyces. A little research reveals that the sourness is also due to dry-hopping.  Overall, sipping on it and considering it over the time frame of ten minutes or so, I find it to be quite refreshing, though my particular taste palate tends to harken to a sweeter, more approachable style. Malheur Tripel is my current ultimate example of a Belgian Tripel, and Rodenbach is my current favorite as far as a sour Flemish red beer; these are but a few of my favorites, which tend to give an example of what my palate savors.  15 or twenty minutes in, I find myself enjoying it, though I would like that hint of sweetness, which I find adds a different measure of complexity, as opposed to the sour, yawning complexity of this unusual, different animal.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

It has an orangish glow/hue like Emily Didinato carving a pumpkin. Then, with the taste (which let Raul down at first) is a very respectable - yet a bit sedated - funk, Belgian yeasts and grass.

Nose is not overly assertive, bready notes, Belgian yeast prevalent. My first thought was that it was pretty boozy for a 6.9% beer, but I think the extremely dry finish contributed to that. Really clean taste, but not a lot of flavor if that makes sense. Bitterness throughout the drink makes it enjoyable.

There’s also a dry, oak smell lingering in the background that goes with the funk.  T: 4.25 More funk and less yeast than the nose. A lot more unique than most of the other trappist ales. Dry funk dominates without fruity, spicy esters like other Belgian ales. There’s a little sweetness with some grass, green apple, and breadiness at the end.  M: 4.5 Carbonation is great.

O: 4.25 I wasn’t sure I liked this beer very much at first, but I came to really enjoy the funk and dryness. It is very well balanced with a very unique and enjoyable character.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,mtomlins,4.17,"Poured from a 330ml bottle into a stemmed tulip glass  Pours a nice, crisp, clear copper in color with a massive, billowy, cloudy head that will not die and eventually leaves some nice lacing. The nose starts with some sweet malt, orange peel, tart lemon and musty yeast. On the palate, the beer opens up further and is much drier than the nose with lemon peel, and a slight tart funkiness to round it all out. The taste finishes with a pleasant floral hop bitterness. Orval is medium body with plenty of carbonation. Overall, this is a unique beer, very subtle and nuanced and stands apart from many/most of the other Trappists.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,SD-Alefan,4.81,"Poured from a bottle into a Chimay chalice. This one was bottled in Oct., 2012.  The bottle opened with a nice, resounding ""pop."" An aggressive center pour produces a big, foamy root beer head that compacts but lasts to the end of the beer. The color is a very hazy, even cloudy brownish-orange.  The aroma is my favorite part of this beer. First off for me, an odor of yeasty bread rising. then some fruit; raisin, maybe orange and lemon. There is also a little farmyard funk underneath.  The first taste is candy at first, then some dried fruits, then a light bitterness as it warms. I get raisin, dates, some yeastiness and even bitter chocolate. As it warms, some biscuit and even a little caramel come through. Love the slight yeasty funk. Amazingly complex.  This beer is well carbonated, and it feels a little sticky and tongue-coating. It's even got a little creaminess thanks to the never-fading foam.  Just a great beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Heavily carbonated. Color is murky golden orange.  Aroma: Pear, banana and coriander. Balanced, smooth and subtle with some nice brett funk (sour grape and must).  Taste: Tart fruit and citrus with a spicy bitter backbone. Tannin notes. Finishes smooth and clean with some dank astringency. Brett horsiness is there and it is pleasant.  Moutfeel: substantive but well attenuated. Dry-ish. Not bubbly.  Overall: Extremely balanced, complex and drinkable.

37,129,jazzyjeff13,3.13,"A 330ml bottle with a BB of Nov 2014. Bottled in Nov 2009. Acquired ages ago from a webshop and stored in my garage. I have no idea what it'll be like after such a long time - fingers crossed. Love the iconic bottle.  Poured into a Duvel tulip. Bottle conditioned. A deep orange-amber hue with faint haze and plentiful carbonation. Produces a vast head of fluffy white foam that resembles a meringue; this slowly reduces to a thick surface layer. Some lacing. Aroma of tart fruitiness with hints of cherries, raisins, barnyard funk, grain, a twinge of sherry, earthy yeast, cardboard and faint solvent. Dry and vinous, with a complex character that is vaguely reminiscent of fruit lambic. Bizarre but smells quite good.  Tastes of harsh stewed leaves with a dry, mildly sour character. Notes of acrid stewed leaves, harsh cardboard, oxidation, a subtle fruitiness, a whisper of funk and vinous yeast. Highly attenuated, followed by a dry, herbal bitterness upon swallowing. None too pleasant. Mouthfeel is dry and tingly with effervescent carbonation and lacklustre body. Very astringent, accompanied by an aftertaste of acrid stewed herbs, faint sourness and dry, earthy yeast.  Oh dear - not a very enjoyable glassful. I guess this hasn't aged well or I've kept it for too long (probably both). Looks great, and the aroma is pleasantly complex with hints of brett and fruity notes. However, the flavour is deeply unpleasant - very harsh and dry with little of what you'd expect from a good beer. Body is also subpar; fizzy and too thin. A great pity, as I've really enjoyed Orval when I've had it before and was looking forward to a top notch brew. Most likely it's just too old. I'll try and re-review a fresher version when I get the chance. Oh well....",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,fmccormi,4.18,"Straight pour from an 11.2oz/325ml pry-off bottle to a teku; a bottling date of February 7, 2013 and a freshness date of February 7, 2018 (five years, wooo) is printed in white ink to the left of the logo on the label (“BOTTLED ON 02/07/2013 BEST BEFORE 02/07/2018 B”)—so, just over 15 months old. Now that is some excellent freshness info.  Appearance (3.5): Four fingers of ecru-colored foam easily rise off of the pour, capping a rich, copper-colored body that’s moderately hazy but not cloudy. The head dies down at a moderate pace, leaving just sparse lacing in the form of thin splotches and webbing. Admittedly, the lacing is disappointing at first, but the head and body together were gorgeous. As the beer recedes, it does leave a few long, chunky splotches of thick lace.  Smell (4.25): Some interesting vinous notes at first blush (rich, off-dry white wine, but no wood), followed quickly by a little tart fruit (white grapes, unsweetened apple juice), and then a nice, bucolic funk—a little musty basement, plenty of dried hay. As it warms, a little more fruit comes out, in the form of some dry apple cider and a little crushed pineapple.  Taste (4.25): There’s a lot going on here, quite frankly, but it’s lovely and surprisingly crushable considering what the beer looks like (kinda hefty). A grassy, juicy flavor leads, slightly bitter, followed by a light, vinous mixture of mildly tart fruit (white grapes) and minerality (like a not-too-dry sauv blanc). This is all underscored by a well-balanced blend of malt and surprisingly clean funk: fresh-baked, rustic wheat bread, just a little bit of mustiness and hay, a bit of spicy phenolic character (like grains of paradise and coriander, maybe?) and a light, clean snap of lemon zest. A lightly spicy, faintly phenolic aftertaste lingers for a bit, but dissipates cleanly.  Mouthfeel (4.0): The body is medium-weight, nicely fluid (not at all syrupy, but only slightly drying), and accompanied by a voluminous, soft carbonation that enters fully-expanded and leaves with just a soft tingle, overall. Way too easy to drink. It finishes cleanly and pleasantly, leaving very little trace of its presence (absolutely no booze, no particularly notable drying effect, etc.).  Overall (4.25): This beer is always an experience, because I swear it’s different every time I drink it. And, every time it’s delicious. Some common currents between all experiences: lightly tart fruitiness, vinous character, minerality, hay and must, clean phenolic funk, and light spice. Occasionally it’s surprisingly hoppy, occasionally the musty character is very pronounced, occasionally the spice and phenols are greater, occasionally the tartness is much greater, and occasionally the head is absolutely out of control. But every time—including this time—it’s delicious. It’s easy to scoff at the price for a single, but given the quality of the beer it’s always worth buying, at least every once in a while.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

There are some funky notes in there also but every note plays off each other so well it leaves me wanting another sip.

37,129,FFreak,4.59,"I've heard so much about this beer that I picked it up when I saw it on the shelf. Its not at all what I was expecting. Poured into a glass, the beer is highly carbonated, which is expected of a Belgian. What was not expected was the odd spicy bitterness that completely overwhelms the malt in this beer. I didn't find it pleasant at all. I couldn't even finish the bottle. Its like biting into a raw bitter cinnamon stick or something. Maybe I don't have a sophisticated enough palette. I've had trapist beer that was amazing, and some funky (brett) beers that I really enjoyed, but this beer has a different and not at all pleasing funkiness. Sorry, i just don't get it.  [EDIT] With the hype about this beer from truly knowledgeable folks in the beer industry, I could not believe that I had such a bad experience to cause the review above. I stand by that review and now attribute it to a bad or very old bottle. Due to my disbelief, I decided to give it another try. This time the bottle was labelled differently, with a manufactured date (almost two years old) and a best by date (almost two years in the future). That puts this bottle right in the sweet spot. This time I was thoroughly impressed with the beer and I see why it is so highly regarded. My numbers are readjusted to reflect the second tasting.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,MagicJeff,4.5,"Poured from a bottle into my Orval chalice/tulip. I usually drink these with a couple years of age--this one is relatively new, having been brewed in September of '16.  Look: Deep copper and grayish white head. I was careful pouring this and poured very slow, and still got a solid finger of head.  Smell: Slightly funky, Banana bread yeast. Champagne/vinous. Slight green apple. Fresh grass clippings that got rained on. Pear and lemon grass. So much going on here.  Taste: Lemony hop goodness gives way to yeasty funk. Something is off and in a good way--I think this has something to do with the yeast. Green apple slices but not too tart. Crisp lemon grass finish. Lots of carbonation makes this very refreshing and makes me want to take another sip. This could be great for pairing with cheese.  Feel: Medium bodied and very creamy due to the head retained throughout. Champagne/sparkling wine type mouthfeel in the finish.  Overall: This beer has earned its reputation. Always reliable and gets better with age. I think I still prefer Orval's with age due to the nuances that develop, but even being under a year old, this thing is so complex.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,elNopalero,5,"Update: Bottle dated 8/18/2011, enjoyed 1/19/2013  Split this bottle. The beer itself pours a cloudy hazy orange-tan. One glass had impressive foaming and long head retention, while the other glass had only a thin tight layer of bubbles. (I have both a rinse with cold water prior to pouring.)  The aroma has an earthy, lemony character to it. There’s a light funk which emerges, like wet hay, along with some tangerine peel and something that reminds me of a good sweat from a tough workout.  The flavor is earthy with a mild spice that runs into a funky finish. It’s peppery and earthy with a long, long finish. I found layers of flavor—wet hay, tangerine and orange preserves, leather, and tobacco—that just are a delight to enjoy. Great effervescent, fantastic body. I love how this beer changes over time.  Dated 10/02/2011 but purchased before then. Does it mean February 10, 2011?  First time drinking this iconic beer. This is a moment for the record books! Or, at the least, Beer Advocate.  Poured into a tulip. It’s cloudy, sandy-colored, with a big layer of foam sitting atop. I smell coriander, orange peel, apricot must on the edges. Just a wonderful, wonderfully complex aroma.  First sip is an eye opener. Sharp, concentrated flavor with a dry finish that goes for a victory lap on the palate. Lots of yeasty esters and an effervescence that coats your mouth. There’s some slight sour and funky notes that hang around and become more pronounced as the beer warms. Incredibly complex.

37,129,itsscience,4.66,"Orval is a beer that, more than any other I know, varies from bottle to bottle. Despite this, it remains a favorite and has never let me down. This review covers a beer bottled on 7 Feb 2013 and consumed more than a year later in Apr 2014.  Forceful carbonation almost popped the cap off when I went to open it. It pours murky orange with a huge four-finger head of white foam and there's still carbonation streaming up the glass. The nose is bready, tangy, and full of brett yeast, bringing barnyard funk and a woodsy characteristic. It smells unlike any other Trappist ale I know of, coming across like a high-quality sour. In past tastings I got a lot of spice from the yeast, but I get none of that here. There's a slight sourness and a seriously oaky, earthy quality with more of that barnyard flavor. It finishes dry and vinous, like a white wine. The body on it is pretty light.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

I definitely didn't pick up on this when it was fresh. A bit vinous, oaky, funky.. With lots of malt in the background. The flavor is on par, the Brett is subtle at first but once your palate picks up on the oaky barrel flavor, the barnyard door opens wide! Medium in body with high carbonation. This is fantastic aged, but I was bit impressed with it fresh... I honestly had written it off as a standard Belgian ale..

Tons of sticky lacing.  Smell - Some woody sour brett funk. Pears, white grape, apples, banana, clove, etc.  Taste - Nice sour brett pucker with malt coming in strong behind and fruity, picking up light banana and moderate clove at first, others as it warms.  Mouthfeel - Light-medium bodied with zesty carb. If I had to fault one thing it would be a tad overcarbed, but I didn't mind. Slight malt warmth is pleasant. Great drinkability.

The thin lacing later on is extremely sticky, leaving blankets of foam on the side of the glass, popping away to random smaller traces. The smell is really unique, as i remember it, with sweet apricots, acidic apples and pears, strawberries, low citrus, honey, lots of flowers and a nice green saison-like funk. You could just smell this for hours. Really complex taste. It doesn't start off with the fruitiness as expected, but with the barnyard funk and the herbs, the candi sugar (just mildly sweet, mind you) and prickly peppercorn. Fruitiness follows, crisp and acidic, with clear green apple (with a tiny bit of tartness) and yellow pears, mixed up with some grains. The green funk never leaves the palate, all till the (rather) bitter finish. A bit too much carbonation, especially considering the crispness of the beer. Refreshing, yes. Alcohol is very subtle, aftertaste consists of, you guessed it, funk. No wonder i rated this 5 at first, it's absolutely amazing.

Mild, at first overwrought with bubbles, a little sourness. Sourness would be nice if it wasn't so lonely. Followed by some yeast, but not a lot. Very mild and mellow. Sourness is not big but it lingers.  High carbonation, feels like a shaken bottle of soda.  Pedestrian in my opinion. It doesn't really have the Belgian characteristics like malt that I'm used to.

Smell- Orange peel, faint green apple tartness, a bit vinous on the white side of the spectrum, a bit of bread and honey. Complex.  Flavour- Less complex- quite bready and dry with a bit of the white vinous backend. Some oak on the finish though I don't know if this is made with any oak. Not as much of the citrus peel or the apple tartness to be honest, which would have added a lot more to this beer.  Mouthfeel- medium bodied, well carbonated, very dry. Which makes sense as the Brett has had two years to work its magic. Aftertaste of a dry oaky white vinous flavour.

Starts with hops, and bitter fizz, and runs a long arc of flowers, grass, wet hay, barnyard, citrus flavors then a long, long, long dry finish, like good wine. Great with Cheese as Jason wrote. (Tonight French Comte) (cheese almost a must, in another case Irish cheddar with fresh baked bread, and another late harvest garden tomato with balsamic). Ultimate fine and creamy cheese beer pairing. **As soon as I poured, I went back to the fridge for the cheddar. Cheese a must!  Mouthfeel: Interesting twist. A wee heavy, and long finish with dry bitterness. WIne-like, long long finish. I like it like I'd like a Jayer Cote de Nuit.  Drinkability: This is a great Trappist beer.

37,129,BillBabbitt,2.46,"I enjoy Belgian ales, but I was very disappointed with Orval. It was overly carbonated. I was only able to get about 3 oz of beer in a 16 oz tulip glass, due to the heavy foam. Once I was able to try the Orval, I found it to have a very unusual industrial aroma. I did not finish the beer. The 'brewed on' date indicated that this bottle was nearly 13 months old, so it is possible it had turned.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,ONovoMexicano,4.16,"Popped the top off the bottle and was greeted by a lot of carbonation.  This resulted in a ton of head on the pour, meaning I had to set the beer aside for a while to let the head reside. It was persistent as hell, foamy and full of big carbonation bubbles. The liquid was a cloudy copper with visible carbonation. Not bad, but seemed to be a bit overcarbed.  It's fruity, earthy and yeasty on the nose, like a saison. Some hint of citrus and even some pepper. It smells summery and light.  It's lighter than I expected, body-wise and of course has a carbonated feel. I continue to get citrusy notes on the palate, some dark fruit notes, earthiness, and pepper. There's something floral about the beer as well. I appreciate that the yeast isn't overbearing in taste or on the tongue.  Good stuff.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,brureview,4.59,"This is one of most unusual Belgians I have tasted. The beer was brewed in January '13.  Poured in an Orval Trappist glass: a beautiful light tea color with bubbling from the bottom of the glass.  Aroma: At first, unusual clove, and light fruit, which is stronger with warming. The clove is different than any other Belgian beer I have tasted.  The mouth feel is very carbonated and works well with the style. The beer is unusually dry.  The taste develops with warming. At first clove and then stronger fruit. Barnyard funk begins to come into the taste with warming. Reminiscent of a Saison Brett funk.  The finish is peppery and bitter. The consistency is champagne-like. This beer drinks like a champagne.  Overall- unique. No other Belgian tastes like this. It's a sipper for a 6.9ABV. Warming brings out different aroma/taste qualities.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

The smell is unique as the beer itself because the brettanomyces yeast that gives this beer its characteristic aroma.  T: Citric and dry, with mild sweetness and good bitterness, this beer is quite refreshing unlikely its kin trappistes beers that are normally more strong and ""hotter"" beers, can't feel the alcohol at all, just that fruit unique flavor that I can't barely describe.  M: A mild and dry bitterness that resembles wine to me. A superb mouthfeel in my opinion, that makes you want to contemplate every sip you take of this beer.  O: Unique, this trappist beer is unique between its pars and between every other beer you find out there, I strongly recommend this beer to every one that appreciates a good beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

But now as I have had it over the years and my palate has developed more I have fallen in love with this classic. Even have an orval chalice now! Cloudy amber with two fingers of white foam and thick lacing. Smell captures the somewhat funky and fruity citrus notes of the yeast with floral accents, black pepper, herbs, hay, and kisses of booze. Taste starts as the nose does with the citrus, dry yet expressive yeast, a kiss of booze, and ester notes with a biting crescendo of black pepper, some light hay, herbs, apple cider vinegar, and funk.

Going to take a couple pours to get this one into the glass. Leaves some chunks of lacing on the glass. Loads of visible carbonation in the glass.  S: The brett in this one is starting to pull through giving it a bit of a funkiness or lambic quality. A little bit of spiciness pulls through the backend.  T: As with the aroma, this one is showing its age with the Brett yeast flavors. Hops are still solid, proving its a Belgian pale ale.  M: Light to medium body with bubbly carbonation. Dry on the tongue from the Brett and hop combination.  Overall as Michael Jackson has said this is a great aperitif. It is light and very easy drinking with a crisp and refreshing character. Interesting to see how this has developed.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Leaves some lacing. Cloudy dirty orange/brown with huge amounts of carbonation. A few yeast float around. Why not.  Smell: It fills the room. Dried dark fruit - raisins, figs, slightly brandy-ish. Lots of funk, brett notes. Spice, cloves and sour. Fattening and complex.  Taste: Complex. Heavy farmhouse brett funk, leather but not off-putting. Spicy. Caramel sweetness, but hard to appreciate with all that excessive carbonation. Some metallic aftertaste, but not too much - comes and goes. Also moderate sour and hop bitterness in the aftertaste. Complex and interesting as fuck - not sure it's my cup of tea - but it does get better every sip.  Mouthfeel: Lots of crisp, aggressive carbonation - kinda hinders the overall taste. Medium body, leaves some coating.  Overall: A tough one. I do like the progressive complexity, the not too in-your-face brett character with sour notes, but the carbonation is silly and gets in the way.

TASTE: the taste follows the nose. funky bread, caramel, apples. The hop profile is somewhat subdued, a balanced beer. The alcohol is well hidden.  PALATE: creamy with a high amount of carbonation,  OVERALL: this is a very good beer but Duvel Belgian Pale Ale sets the standard.

Smell: Fresh straw, dandelions, citrus, and a bit peppery.  Taste: Dry, spicy, long finish where the notes from nosing can be revisited  Mouthfeel: Dry and initially a slight bit creamy even; then creates a small amount of ""cottonmouth,"" but not in a negative way.

S - for me, this is the strong point of the beer. i am absolutely drawn in by the smell on this one. its hard to even put my finger on what im smelling because its all seems to mix so well together into its own smell. has a nice citrusy and floral hint off the top but its prime character is almost that of fresh wood. it smells sweet and savoury at the same time. definitely pineapple and fresh bread coming through. maybe some banana, cloves or coriander as well? all my favourites ;)  T -the taste leaves a bit to be desired after the incredible smell off the top, and also for a beer thats rated so highly in the belgian pale ale category. with that being said i did enjoy the taste of this beer as it seemed to have a good balance of hops and malt and didn't have any overpowering alcohol taste like ive found from a few other belgian pale ales. it is definitely a unique beer.  M - i was dissapointed with the amount of carbonation in this beer. i feel like if they toned that down slightly the flavours would come out a lot more (maybe why the head was so long lasting). however, the carbonation did make me burp quite a bit :p bringing out some flavours i may have missed (hopefully not yesterdays lunch) at the same time it goes down pretty easy once the carbonation dies down a bit  O - well i finally got to try the trappist beer ive been waiting so long for. i feel like the anticipation of trying it may have ruined it a little for me, but i still enjoyed the beer a lot. i picked up a few bottles so ill be getting a couple more tries at this one. not my favourite trappist, but hey, its better than a lot of whats available in my area so i won't complain. a trip to the monastery in belgium might help me enjoy this one a little more ;) great beer!",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

For a young bottle, the Brett qualities are very apparent on the nose. Lots of musty, earthy, leathery notes, but then there's also a good amount of ripe fruit - apple, apricot, peach.  Just about bone dry flavor profile with an earthy/funky vibe. Apple and pear skin. Yeasty and leathery. A lot of hard to pin down flavors intermingled. Very carbonated but not punishingly so - the bubbles soften considerably after a few minutes.  Orval has a storied history but it doesn't quite live up to the hype. Has a lot of complexities, but they're muddled and the flavors don't ""pop."" Hard to recommend over, say, Matilda.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

This beer has the most incredible head I’ve seen in a long time, and it seems to have no intention of going anywhere soon (4/5). Aroma: Musty and woody. Like a back of an old cabin. I also get a faint whiff of pineapple (4/5). Taste: The earthy Brett character is dominant, but there is also a touch of pine, honey, and apples. The background flavors become more predominant as the beer nears room temperature (4.25/5). Mouthfeel: Highly effervesent. There is so much carbonation, in fact, that I get a touch of a burn following the swallow. Medium body (3.75/5). Overall: Amazing beer that has been an inspiration to many brewers all over the world. This pint is incredible, but it seems like some of the edges could be rounded out a bit.

37,129,cbutova,5,"Finally reviewing an all-time favorite. Feb, 02 2012 bottle side by side with March 07, 2013.  02/29/2012: A- Massive foamy white head builds to at least three fingers high atop a slightly hazy, medium amber body. Head retention is supreme and it never dies down staying about a centimeter thick and leaving a blizzard of thick lace. S- Surprised to notice so much aged feel here. I guess it is only 6.2% or so but it has a reputation since it contains live bugs. Aged caramel and grape/raisin fruit sweetness feel and some Belgian yeast spices. T- Follows the nose with some added yeast feel. Vinous grapes, raisin, earthy must and Belgian yeast spice. Has a strong feel of age, almost overshadowing the rest of the beer. With warmth some dry, horsey Brett but just a hint. Some strange tartness, like grapes again. MF- Foamy and fulfilling texture. Carbonation super high and it bites the palate. Slight spicy bitterness. A bit too vinous and just has that general old dusty raisin caramel feel. Perhaps it varies bottle by bottle or takes longer to develop but looking forward to the fresh one.  03/07/2013 (for review, I believe in fresh beer) A- Noticeably louder hiss when popping the cap instantly has me excited. Perhaps the 2012 bottle just wasn't up to the Orval standard (it was perfect for appearance). Even tilting the glass almost flat, it foams up out of the glass and I have to rescue it from getting to wild. One HAND head with infinite retention it seems as bubbles shoot up the glass like machine guns. The head is over an inch out of the chalice. Five minutes later the head has seemed to grow more, what to do... drink through the shield!  S- Brett is on another scale compared to the 2012 bottle, it doesn't even smell similar. Pungent, classic Belgian Brett character with funk, cherries and plenty of horsey barnyard. Sour lemon juice notes makes me anticipate some tartness. Earthy, spicy and funky Brett beast. With some warmth, more Trappist yeast spice comes out and balances the wildness to perfection.  T- Taking a sip and getting a face full of foam reveals something a bit milder but more rounded out than the nose. The earthy and funky Brett dries this out completely with some barnyard, cherry pie, dried fruit and horse blanket notes. Some cracker malts and Belgian Trappist yeast spice provides a nice compliment to the wild bugs. Slight lemon peel but somehow less than the nose.  MF- Foamy and intensely carbonated but somehow it all goes down super smooth, thanks in part to a creamy texture. Finishes with some funky spice feel. Drier than desert sand.  This is more like it! This is the beer I remember having so many times. Not sure if I just got a random off bottle that I ended up aging but the Brett and Trappist yeast balance here is something of beauty. Perhaps the greatest overall beer on the planet. Always available and outstanding... All hail the trout and the golden ring. So many moral problems with perfect fives nowadays but I have a hard time justifying not doing it. This beer is as close as it gets.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,taxandbeerguy,4.01,"Had a bottle of this at an establishment in Hamilton the other day as it was something they carried and I've been eager to try.  Served cool into an Orval tulip.  Appearance - Dark honey and copper color with 2.5 fingers of head that created a mountain overflowing the glass. Fortunately none of the head spilled onto the table. The head is just pillowy off-white clouds and lingered for a long while and left some beautiful lacing. Very delicate and meticulous looking. Very hazy as well.  Smell - Honey, light and floral, slight caramel sweetness. Hints of melon as it warmed a bit too. Pretty impressive so far.  Taste - The taste is nice.... but to describe it is difficult. There's not really a whole lot of easily definable tastes here, every sip seems a bit different and the taste is fleeting. It has a bit of a orange undercurrent with a bit of a dank earthiness. Bit of a bitter finish that seems most reminiscent of a Tripel rather than anything else. Quite tasty, but because of the lightness and fleeting flavors it's hard for me to score this any higher.  Mouthfeel - Smooth with a richness that is there but retains the very light character established with the other senses. Medium carbonation is also good here.  Overall - Very glad I tried it, if was available at LCBO or TBS I would consider picking this up again, however it does not seem to be frequently available and at the price tag it comes with, I would rather drink other beers when out, or buy beer in a similar vein at LCBO and get 3-4 times as much.

Strong funky sweet orange floral nose.  Slightly sour, strong ester and phenol presence. A slight bit of metallic bitterness in the finish. Completely dry without any hint of malty sweetness. Very little in the way of lingering flavors other than a tanginess in the front of the mouth and a lasting bitterness on the tip of the tongue. All sensations are on the front of the tongue, on the front of the upper palate and in the nose, nothing for the back of the tongue or throat.  This beer lives in the nose and on the front of the tongue. Be sure to pour it in a proper glass and enjoy the nose.

Pours a hazy golden amber. 2 inches of foamy head almost the whole drinking session.  I think I have an older bottle, so it smells less hoppy, and more funky- the brett is coming through strong. I smell tart apples, grass, and barnyard-esque aromas.  Tastes pretty similar. Slightly woody, very funky, some grassy hops, Belgian yeast dominates. A very complex ale, for sure. Not very bitter, I don't know if the hops impart any bitterness to fresh bottles.  Medium, creamy mouthfeel. Well carbonated, pretty dry and chalky.

A - Orval almost gushes from it's bottle even at the 50° serving temperature due to it's abundant carbonation. Hazy but beautiful deep golden in color, the beer forms a massive and loose eggshell head with incredibly retention and heavy lace coating the glass.  S - Lovely honey graham cracker malt backing allows for a luscious aroma of Brett horseblanket funk that contributes suggestions of pine, mint, and goaty, hay undertones.  T - Any hop aroma that faintly emerged disappears completely in flavor, shifting almost entirely to the beer's Brett yeast esters of horseblanket, wet straw, and overall barnyard funk, but tamed down considerably.  M - Highly carbonated, Orval dances on your tongue joyfully while it's seemingly light body washes down with smoothness, lingering on the tongue with dry spice notes.  O - Delicate Brettanomyces exists, in this beer! Restrained barnyard funk allows the dry cracker-like flavor to stay a large part of the beer while nuances continue to come out as it's enjoyed. The crisp drinkability of Orval suggests it would make for a fantastic session Belgian beer if it weren't near $6 a bottle.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

T: Surprising light and delicate on the palate. Barnyard/earthy notes right up front. Old world hops are present but not at all intrusive. Grass and hints of very dry cider. This beer is quite dry.  M: Medium body with moderate to mild carbonation.  O: An extremely unique, complex and delicate beer as only the Belgians can create.

Big and rocky, with great retention and solid but spread-out lacing with distinct but faint ringing. Certainly darker than what most people (myself included) would expect from a pale ale, even one of the Belgian distinction, but Orval isn't really an easily-classified beer.  Smell - A complex combination of fruity phenols and floral overtones, but a more funky, musty element, like barnyard, but without the tartness that you'll get from some beers that have been fermented with a strain of Brett. The aroma is more dank, with some bits of malty sweetness coming through as well.  Taste - This particular version is heavy on a blend of the darker fruits--most notably raisin and date--along with a fair amount of pungent bitterness. Some notes of grapefruit rind, dandelion green and bittering spirits comes through, as well as some faint esters reminiscent of rich red wine, like cabernet sauvignon.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with ample carbonation. Mostly dry finish.  Overall, a beer that seems to vacillate wildly from bottle to bottle and depending on age. I've had some that were overpowering hop bitterness and funk, others that were floral and slightly fruity, and still others that hint at the darker fruits of your classic Belgian dark ales and quads. It's an enigma to be sure. One that I always enjoy, but I lament the inability to find it very fresh in the U.S., especially after getting to have some that was about 3 months after bottling when I visited Brussels a couple years ago. No matter, as the weirdness and complexity of this beer is what always draws me back. More often than not, if I go to a bottle shop looking for a beer without luck, but don't want to leave empty-handed, I'll grab a bottle of Orval. If you don't like it the first time you try it, I still would encourage you to give it another try.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,DeFaz,4.8,"Is Michael Jordan the best basketball player? It's probably not fair to say since there may be some undiscovered guy out there. And that's how I feel about this beer--in my humble opinion, it seems doubtful that there will ever be a better trappist ale, and yet who knows? What I do know though is that I enjoy the heck out of this--its amazing appearance (a huge foamy head that while receding quickly leaves great lacing) and a smell with complex floral notes and candy-like sweetness that is balanced by something (or everything) and keeps the smell so inviting. The taste is amazing--sweet, delicate, floral, balanced, intense, thoughtful, and beautiful. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy, making it a beer to swirl around in the mouth for several seconds before swallowing, allowing the opportunity to absorb all of the flavors. And yet, even the mouthfeel somehow manages to seek balance with its crispness. Overall, in my opinion this beer is absolutely one of the best out there even considering its relatively high cost (about $4.25 per 11.2 ounce bottle). Some may fail to appreciate the beer because it doesn't have the high ABV of some Belgians or the bitter hop taste of some of their favorite IPAs, but for what it is, it's just about perfect, and I use that word as sparingly as I can.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Tiny bubbles run high up to upper sides of glass when poured trapped by thick cream colored head. This ""Authentic Trappist"" brewer sets itself apart (far apart) from it's fellow monks at the other monastaries that brew the Belgium classics.  Orval I see now brew a 2nd beer but they will always be the best imo because they've been brewing only one for so long so I won't bother to try a cash grab second beer.

37,129,CalgaryFMC,4.13,"Poured from bottle, age uncertain but probably fairly fresh based on published taste descriptions of younger samples. A burnished copper color with a vast quantity of off-white lacey head. Aroma is a potent mix of pear, fermented white grape, citrus notes, some mild peppery spice. The head itself is acrid and bitter, tasting of burlap sack and wood char. Maybe let this settle out and then sip the liquid. The latter recalls lemon meringue pie, pears and apples, figs, a little white wine, aromatic brown spice like nutmeg or calamus, with a bone-dry finish that leaves echoes of barnyard funk and wine cask. Some complain of excess carbonation but I did not notice this. A complex and polarizing beer that stands apart from other Trappist beers and actually captures the monks' intent to create something that is not overtly malty or sweet.

My tastes weren't as sophisticated when I last tried it, so I figured I'd try it again.  Appearance: Huge, persistent, thick creamy off-white head. Really persistent, this thing isn't going anywhere. Dark amber liquid, lots of lacing.  Smell: Lots of brett, a bit of sour, perhaps a bit of balsamic, some alcoholic heat in the nose too. This is beautiful.  Taste: Note: Don't lick up the head. It's bracingly bitter without any redeeming flavors. Actual Taste: Brett, a hint of lemon sour. The alcohol comes through a bit, but not overwhelming. Reminds me more of a saison than a Belgian Pale, probably because of the lightly sour brett. A barely bitter after taste, a crisp malt on the finish too. Much tastier than I remember it being. Head is still present halfway through drinking the beer, ridiculous.  Mouthfeel: Very creamy texture. Not a whole lot in the way of carbonation, this is very drinkable.

T-The figs are here in the taste again, up front. Black cherry stems. Finishes with a light bitterness, but there is a bit of residual sweetness to keep your palate intact. The brett is much more subdued than I anticipated. That tell tale bitterness is there, but without any funk or mustiness.  M-Full bodied, rich but not feeling heavy.

The bubbles almost look like a perfectly toasted marshmallow. Smells of grain, hay, grass, pineapple, pear, and a little clay yeast. Flavor is bitter with a solid biscuity malt profile, some nice corn character and a hint of english cucumber muddled in there someplace. Medium on thin with nearly flat carbonation at this point and a refreshing finish. I'm torn on this beer, as I move toward more delicate beers with nuance and what I currently consider maturity in the beer - I feel like this is a good beer and understand how it's considered world class. I cannot see, however, how this manages to be a approachable beer for me, but leaves me simply empty at the end. I don't long for more, I don't take a sip and immediately want another. For these reasons I continue to steer clear of this one.  From notes verbatim on 10/28/10 A: Pale apricot ale with massive head that just keeps growing. Maybe overly carbonated? Dull clarity.

Of foamy head with slow retention. How do they do that without paint shakers? S - Smell is grassy and bready at the same time. Definite notes of sourness. Not my typical brew.

Really a pretty pour with a head that sits for a moment, then recedes gradually as if to indicate it's ready to be sampled. Not nearly as milky or hazy as some other BPAs (or more specifically other trappist ales).  The smell on this one can take over an otherwise neutral smelling room. The initial rush has a lot but definitely ripe banana, some spice, lemon (rind)... I am always a sucker for the super dry french/normandy cidres, and this beer has a similar bit of yeast that predicates where the taste will go.  A supremely dry beer. There is hardly a trace of fruit on the tongue, and no alcohol at all. It's just an acidic grain-y sensation that is a unique counter to the huge ripe fruits on the nose.  The first couple times I had this beer I didn't ""get"" what was all about. Now I see it as a different and valuable part of the belgian/trappist interpretation of Pale Ale. This beer really bridges two of the major Belgian styles: dry and refreshing enough to hang with the classic Saisons, and enough spice and ripeness to rival the finest tripels.

LOTS of overripe bananas. A little metallic twang. Hard to find anything under the banana. Kinda get a lemon meringue pie, complete with graham cracker crust. Weird, I know. But pleasant.  T: Hmph. Sweet melons and bananas. Some bready malt kicks in it, almost graham cracker like. Banana almost turns tart in the finish with some metallic and grassy flavors. Dry in the finish.  M: Nice medium body. Higher carbonation but nothing over the top.  O: Not a bad BPA. Very interesting fruitiness with good sweetness and drying contrasts.

The color has a very nice solid hue to it.  The beer smell is very nice. Strong, bitter hops dominate the nose and mix well with the Belgian sugar in it. The sugar comes off a little bit as bubble gum note but is still pretty good. The smell also has a bit of sour note to it as well. The note isn't very strong but it resembles a green tart note. The resulting smell also has a peach smell.  The beer taste is pretty earthy with a bit of sour taste to it. The sour is very slight and green apple. The pear note is still there as well. The hop note is also strong in this and bitter. The malt note is also there and nicely sweet that turns the beer into a bit teaish. Also, a nice mineral note in the water.  The mouthfeel is very dry but pretty good. The beer is a bit heavy for a medium bodied beer but the heavy carbonation makes it lighter. Dry finish. The carbonation is pretty biting.

It caught me off guard at first, with the dry and kind of sweet finish. I was also expecting it to be a little more citrusy.  M- Great mouth feel. It drinks very nicely. A light to medium body, with a medium amount of carbonation. This would make a nice session beer if it wasn't for the price.  O - Very good! I wasn't sure of what to expect with this well known beer.

Very dry and there isn't much sugar in this one and with that there isn't a lot of sour. It's very subtle.  Complex? Definitely. It reminds me of a cider with brett sour notes. The problem is it isn't good. Those flavors are ok but they could use more brett or more sugar from malts. There's some herbal bitterness perhaps from hops. It's subtle. There's a lingering sour/hop blended finish the lasts a while. I'm just not liking this beer.  Given it is a sour I didn't expect much body and there isn't much. The head was amazing but the carbonation in the body was below average for a beer...somewhat expected for the style.  Look, I know this one has a huge amount of lovers. Maybe this bottle is between ideal age? About 10 months old maybe another year makes it more sour or a bit fresher it is a bit more something? I don't know. Either way there's nothing really wrong. I have no idea what style you'd call this, it isn't a belgian pale ale as I've come to know them. So I'm not sure how to really judge it....a sour but not sour pale ale?

Taste is dry, with an almost rye quality. Tons of fresh baked bread. Yeasty in a good way. Not as sweet as the smell suggested.  Almost perfect mouthfeel. It has a lot of carbonation; almost like a seltzer water. Very smooth. Fluffy head lightens every sip.  Overall, not as complex as many Belgians. In a way, it is refreshing in how straightforward it is. Fun to drink, but the heavy carbonation makes it sippable, not gluggable. Never overwhelming; every sip is pleasant. The head is the most impressive I have seen.

Nose is complex and kept expanding as it warmed. Sweet Belgian yeast, apples, floral, banana, some medicinal alcohol, a little caramel malt poking through all that bright fruit and brett funk and ultimately finds some spice character. Taste is superb. Relaxed, smooth, full without heaviness, some lemon, some hay and horse blanket. No alcohol on the palate at all. Drinks very dry and leaves a long bitter finish that isn’t tart or sour. It’s earthy and hop bitter.

37,129,hagbergl,4.41,"33 cL bottle of Orval into my Chimay goblet.  Appearance (4/5): Big two and a half finger head of of white over a cloudy orange body. Beautiful. Tight bubbles tell me this is a well-carbonated beer. Extraordinary head retention.  Smell (4.25/5): Yeasty and bretty smell. Lots of sweet bread and light tart funkiness, spice, herbal and medicinal notes, grassy notes from the hops.  Taste (4.5/5): Spicier and yeastier in the taste. Not very sweet. Plenty of brett, though it's pretty light compared to some other beers with brettanomyces that I've had. At the front of the tongue, get some nice effervescence, middle of the tongue transition from bretty funk to a wheat bread and spicy yeasty clove-y flavor that's slightly bitter and lingers for a while. Very interesting and totally unique.  Mouthfeel (4.5/5): Excellent carbonation level. Brett adds some effervescence. Very smooth and goes down easy. The lower alcohol level on this beer means you don't have to exercise too much caution with it. A very nice summertime beer.  Overall (4.5/5): Orval is legendary for a reason. It's a totally awesome beer and a great intro to Brett-infused beer. While it's not a particularly intense beer, it's very refreshing and certainly a unique take on the Belgian Pale Ale. One of the rare Trappist ales that isn't thick and heavy. It also features more obvious hop character than those beers. Great stuff that's certainly worth buying if you see it hanging out on the shelf. And fear not–Orval has quite a good shelf life.

37,129,J_Dub,4.68,"Poured a semi-opaque amber color. No matter how you pour this beer it will produce a generous white head. Tons of lacing as the head dies down.  The nose is the strongest part of this brew. Fruity smell I can't quite place. Reminds me of a hefeweizen actually. Spicy notes dominate with floral and malty hints throughout. There's also a grassy, earthy yeast smell that is very pleasing.  The taste is a slight let down after the wonderful smell. Malt and spiciness right up front with just hint of floral and malt. The overall taste is similar to the nose but doesn't have all the complex layers. The end of the sip brings some grassy flavors but it is too watered down for my tastes. If you could just boost the flavors that are present it would put this beer into a higher plane. As it is, it's very good but misses just slightly.  The mouthfeel is just as expected from a belgian pale. High levels of carbonation. Nice clean and crisp finish.  Fantastic overall beer. Very drinkable and a good representation of the style.

This brew pours with a massive head, it took me three pours to get the whole beer into the glass, most of the thick creamy head stays on top of the beer during drinking. There is also lots of thick, fluffy lacing.  The smell is farmhouse wheat funky along with floral and citrus hops. There is also a lot of fruit in the smell, maybe apples and melon.  The taste is very sweet on the front end and spicy hops on the back end. There is also a wheat and fruit taste.  This beer feels both thick and chewy as well as creamy. It goes down smooth with a little dryness on the backend. Some hop oils remain on the tongue after swallowing.  Overall, I am not sure what to think since this is my first Belgian Pale Ale. It is definitely sweeter than an American Pale ale but the hops that come in on the backend are strong but not overpowering. I like it, I am going to try more of this style.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Great yeasty Belgian smell with some sweeter notes of over ripe fruit, dough set out to rise, and burnt sugar.  T: Nice mellow flavor. It is neither sweet nor bitter. Extremely well-balanced with a generally stanky, grassy, funk. Fabulous.  M: Really smooth overall. Effortlessly hits all the right notes. Crisp up front, a little tinge of citrusy tea that gets darker and danker. Nice smooth, lingering finish.  O: Fantastic beer. Has everything that a beer needs.

37,129,jlindros,4.21,"Bottled on 08/30/12, almost a year old... I love how they actually date the beer and give a best by date, for a famous Trappist Belgian beer.  Even a gentle pour yields a 3 finger huge head and forces me to stop pouring, it fades at a decent rate with big bubbles popping and leaving a nice soap bubbled lacing everywhere like a mess of it, hazy amber color.  Nose is great, a great Belgian with nice wild funk, nice Belgian blond malts, little sweetness and perhaps hint of candi sugar, then grassy aromas, lemony, nice Brett like funk on the lighter side, floral, a little fruity as well, just a touch of a light bready malt, a bit of a sweet candy aroma on the back end as well.  Taste brings sweet malts at first, a nice Belgian golden blond like malt, with some sweetness and a light candi sugar, and general candy like flavor with hint of fruits even. Then into some wild funk, not a ton of funk but a nice Brett like funk, bit chewy and yeasty, with some bready malts. It also brings an interesting bitterness, a light spicy hop character. Funk gets stronger the more I go but never super funky. Finish is dry but a bit sticky, sweet candy malts lingering slightly, a bit more funk, bit more spicy like hops, and light bready malt character.  Mouth is med bodied, lots of fluffy carb.  Overall a really interesting beer, nice Belgian characters blended with nice Brett like funk. This is not even a year old so the wild character is barely there, but I've had some quite aged ones and they are a lot funkier and awesome.

37,129,jdhowe,4.16,"Reviewed in memoriam Simon Johnson (Reluctant Scooper).  I've never had Orval, and I've got no expectations about this beer.  Poured from a bottle dated 30/08/2012.  Bottle opens with a loud hiss and visible gas release... this thing is very carbonated.  A: Pours a clear, deep golden color with tons of fluffy white head. I can't quantify the head because I had to wait for it to recede to finish the pour. I'll go with ""lots.""  S: An earthy, funky, sort of farmhouse aroma backed by sweet fruitiness portending Belgian yeast esters.  T: Sweetness of fruit hits the palate right away, backed by a weaker spiciness that persists through the sip. The spiciness caught me off-guard because I didn't detect it in the nose. Then it's a strong punch of that farmhouse funk, which plays rough with the carbonation on the body -- there's a lot happening in my mouth with each sip, and it would be a lie to claim I didn't miss anything. The finish is smooth with a flavor reminiscent of apple cider -- vaguely citric with some complexity. This beer tastes very good. It's a bit funkier than I like, but I try to avoid deducting for preference when I can.  M: Thin to light medium body, plentifully carbonated. Not going to lie -- I think the carbonation is just a little overdone here. Overall very drinkable -- I'm surprised at just how much of this beer I've consumed while typing this.

T - The most unique of the Trappist ales - maybe the most unique beer in the world. Taste is sharp and funky, a little hoppy on the tip of the tongue, and a wheat-malt finish. Not particularly sweet. Very spicy, with clove, some pepper, a bit of an earthy feel. Nice tangy (but not citrus) on the back end as the beer warms. Very complex and interesting.  M - Initially a little sharp and carbonated. Easier to take in and swish around as it warms a bit. As it warms, it starts to cling pleasantly to the mouth and throat.

37,129,Jeffo,4.03,"Finally actually reviewing this beer. Got this bottle at the liquor store down the road.  From a bottle into a chalice Bottled: 24 January 2013 Best Before: 24 January 2018  APPEARANCE: Pours a huge, 3+ finger, looser, off-white head that grows out of the glass. Head doesn't quit and is somewhat unmanageable. Cloudy safety orange in color with loads of crazy, swirling carbonation all over the place. Big foam cap remains until the end leaving lots of sticky lacing down the glass. A little out of control, which makes it rather difficult to admire.  SMELL: Definite brett on the nose with sour cherries and lemon notes. Pale and wheat malt as well, though I doubt there's any wheat actually in it. Really nice for sure, and plenty forthcoming.  TASTE: Brett tartness up front with lots of lemon sourness and yeasty spices at the swallow. Lingering finish of sour brett again, spicy yeast, some sweet honey and floral hop bitterness as well. Bitter and tart, floral and spicy. A touch of wheat flavor as well. Definitely unique in the trapist lineup. Very nice.  PALATE: Medium body and higher levels of carbonation. Creamy smooth on the palate, goes down smooth and finishes rather dry. A touch puckering perhaps. Good feel here.  OVERALL: Despite the messy beginning, this is really good and enjoyable. Easy and refreshing to drink too. I'd love to try an older bottle of this at some point, as I think a bottle with some age would do really well. Complex and interesting to drink.

Over time the nose becomes dominated by a darkly sweet smell, like overly ripe fruit.

Pours a clear golden-tending-to-amber hue, with a fluffy, relatively large-bubbled, white head, that stays pretty solid and consistent. Body is light, but smooth riddled with very fine carbonation. Looks reasonably good.  Nose is clean and crisp, with a hint of wood, and a slight apple overtone. Some peppery tones and a slight cedar character. It all melds together nicely, giving a slightly aged, slightly fruity character. But it stays pretty light throughout. Yes, indeed.  Taste is actually a lot lighter, a lot dryer than expected. Clean, appley tones on the front. Slight biting phenolic characters towards the back and an uptilt of mild aged funk. The funk actually just dries out the back, and provides much less true funk than I remember.  Feel is light but smooth.  Overall, it's a decent brew, but I remember this being much better. I guess the brett can be patchy anyway, and this may just be a more subtle one than the usual.

Notes of tangerine and pineapple surface late, accompanied by confectioners sugar sweetness and a hint of caramel malt.  Flavor is fairly tart initially and somewhat phenolic, becoming slightly bready mid palate, and finishing fairly bitter and a touch peppery. There's significant mustiness throughout. Tart crab apple esters are somewhat overpowering at first, but sweettarts notes emerge later as respite.  Body is moderate, with fairly high carbonation and significant alcohol warmth.

The aroma has a fresh lemon bite, fresh citrus peel, banana with a bit of Pinesol freshness as well. There’s Belgian yeast and has much similarity to Duvel. It’s nice and refreshing.  The taste is exciting, yet malty mellow. There is an initial fresh pop like Duvel with lemon and freshness along with pepper, then it eases into a bitterness like grapefruit and that Brett bite of grass and funk. There’s a hop astringent bitterness with the finish.  This beer is not here to blow your socks off, but instead, be extremely well crafted.

This needs to warm up to serving temperature for it's flavours and aromatics to really open up, but it has such a funky, dirty profile. The nose, once it warms up is huge & complex. Floral hops, citrus, clove and a slight bit boozy. It tastes like it was made in a barn in some back country. It has some similarities to a hot toddy maybe. It is a tiny bit over-carbonated for my liking, but this helps to ensure a very long, bitter & fruity finish.

37,129,TheCondor,4.34,"I just assumed this beer would be on the Beers of Fame list, well I assumed wrong. It has not yet garnered the necessary 2000 reviews. So I am trying to help that along with this review. Side poured with standard vigor from the bottle into a Chimay goblet.  Appearance - Pours an awesome hazy copper color with a big, bubbly, soapy two finger head with decent retention, probably a few minutes worth. Leaves little lacing. Carbonation is immediately seen inside the glass. Packaging is very simple, but beer shows an excellent presentation.  Smell - I can smell the beer as I pour it, you hardly need to stick your nose close to it to smell it. Fruits, sugar, candies, heavy phenol and clove aroma, exceptionally strong aroma. Complex and delicious.  Taste - Follows the nose pretty closely. The initial rush of carbonation on the palate is followed by the sweetness. Bitter on the beginning, then supplanted by sweet candies, oranges and banana, and finally the clove. Super funky, you could tell this was Belgian with your eyes closed. Very solid. Beer gets more bitter and funky as it warms, don't let it get too warm though.  Mouthfeel - One of my favorite parts of the beer. Heavily carbonated, very dry and crisp on the finish, with the cloves and a bit of bitterness rounded out by a sweet sensation on the palate. Outstanding finish.  Overall - This beer belongs on the Beers of Fame, and it will make it there as soon as it reaches the cusp of that 2000th review. It is an outstanding beer, one I would be more than happy to drink over and over again. Very happy I bought it. Condor recommended and approved.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Smells decently hoppy, with other similaraities to a hefe with notes of citrus, subtle banana, and clove, with a splash of coriander. Drinks very smooth, with a subtle hoppy bite. Very distinictive belgian yeast taste, but with more bitterness than than sweetness, yet not overpowering. Lot's of carbonation. Has a sort of wine like aftertaste, but lacks the punch i was expecting for a 7% beer, i guess this could be good or bad. Very well balanced beer, will buy more, although I prefer other Trappist Beers, this one stylistically is very different stylistically from the likes of Rochefort, Westmalle, etc..",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Haydn-Juby,2.92,"served from a 330ml bottle  A: Hazy copper color partially due to the yeast in it. A bubbly, white two finger head. Looked pretty tasty.  S: Very phenol heavy aroma. Clove like. I found it almost band-aid like.  T: There was a little bit of honey, clove, and bubblegum. Hop bitterness was mild. The aftertaste was very displeasing to me. It tasted very grainy and metallic like. Really it was this gross aftertaste that killed it for me.  M: This was a pretty decent aspect of the beer. It finished pretty crisp and bubbly  O: There seems to be a group of people who loves this beer and those who hate it. Personally I'm the latter. I just don't like it. Not that other people shouldn't its just not what floats my boat. I wish I could like this and it really seemed like something that I would. I'm typically a pretty big fan of anything with a Belgian yeast strain in it but this just didn't do it for me. I feel like I'm going to have to give this another go in the future.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,JamesQuaff,4.86,"Poured into a Duvel tulip from an 11.2oz bottle, with a bottling date of 08/18/2011. Gifted to my on my birthday by a good friend with great taste and extreme patience. Told myself I was going to wait for a special occasion, but today thought ""wouldn't cracking this aged Orval MAKE today a special occasion?"".  A: Pours a rich copper-orange with a dense and luxurious one finger head which leaves rather thick fingers of lacing that slowly retract completely into the brew. Plenty of carbonation rising up from the bottom of the glass. Beautiful.  S: The nose is giving me something different every time I go back. Wildflower honey, banana, grains, some pepper, a tiny bit of horehound candy, tropical fruit, and a funky barnyard vibe toward the back. Belgian all the way. The honey seems to come up to the front to me the most.  T: Oh man... the taste. This beer is absolutely sublime. Subtle initial hop bitterness fades into a slight honeyed sweetness which gives way to a most delicious funky finish. Kind of like how you can taste the Asturian hill country in Cabrales blue cheese or taste the ocean in a fresh oyster. This fleeting idea of a flavor note that floats away from the finish must be what an abbey tastes like. Mind-blowing.  M: Medium-bodied, creamy and smooth. The carbonation is luxurious and velvety.  O: Definitely one of the finest beers to ever cross my lips. Hands down the best example of a BPA I've ever had. This was my first encounter with Orval, so I've never had a young version to compare with this one. I will absolutely be adding a few bottles to my growing collection and sampling them at various ages.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,artoolemomo,4.93,"Appearance- I just poured a whole glass of head. This has huge bubbles and is receding quickly. The foam is white with hints of yellow and the body is clearer than a typical pale ale. It is light honey/amber. Very little lacing is left and it seems to have slowed at about an inch. Leaves lacing after additional pours.  Nose- Starts off with lots of typical Belgian notes- yeast, esters, apple, floral fragrances. Very perfumey. Lots of crisp apple. If the flavor profile is anything like the aroma, this is going to be a very enjoyable beer. Some soapiness as well.  Taste- This is intense to say the least. Lots of Brettomyces. Very funky, very overpowering. Apple and sour lemon come out at the edges. There's a little burn on it but it aids in the structure of the beer. On the second taste, the funkiness of the Brett dies down and allows the more temperate flavors of orange, apple, orange peel, lemon and strawberry take over. This is very crisp and very dry. It is perfect for summertime.  Mouthfeel- This is pretty heavy but it is balanced by a super smooth creaminess. The carbonation is perfect with some slight tingling. The mouthfeel is one of the best aspects of this beer.  Drinkability- This goes down fast and easy. Even it's 6 dollar price tag isn't prohibitive. This beer is that good.  Overall- Easy to review and grade. A+, no doubts about it. I have founded a new go to beer. This easily one of the top ten Belgian beers that I have had. This is much more exciting than a quad. It has the simplicity and perfection of some Tripels with the added positive of Saison messiness. This is a delight to drink.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,darky,3.93,"Bottled on 11-17-2011, poured into chalice. Reviewed 3-16-13  A: pours a brilliant light orange capped with a persistent 1/2"" white head.  S: Orange and grapefruit are primary with that characteristic hint of banana so many Belgians have.  T: This is, I believe, the third time I've tried this brew, but the first time really 'tasting' it. I didn't pay any attention to vintage until now, and I would wager those bottles were significantly fresher than this one. I distinctly recall this beer being far dryer (to the point that I struggled with it) with a more pronounced hop character the previous two times. This pour is definitely mellower with muted orange at the start and middle, and then the trademark Orval grapefruit-y (again, mellowed) dry bite on the finish.  M: Soft and creamy, ample carbonation. Quite good really.  O: I really wish I had a younger version to compare this bottle to right now. I don't think this particular bottle is representative of what this beer is like fresh. I am enjoying it, but it's not at all what I remember it to be, or how others have described it here on BA. I will revisit this one with a fresher specimen when I find one.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Kinda fruity maybe apples, a hint of spice  T-Smooth earthy bitterness up front with a hint of citrus and spice, hints of pilsner malt  M-Kinda tart, overall dry and very thirst quenching  O-A must try beer! Definitely a bench mark example of the Belgian Pale Ale",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,MarioM,4.41,"11.2 oz poured into a Russian River stemmed glass.  A: Nice almost cloudy light orange color with a huge head made from medium to small bubbles. Almost sticky looking foam, very common to brett beers. Ok lacing, head is lingering but is not sticking to the glass but is definitely standing its ground.  S: Light funk from the brett, a bit malty and tropical fruit like. Good phenolic character from the wild bacteria.  T: A lot o brett character, dry crisp and nice phenols. It definitely lets you know your drinking a beer with wild yeast. The Brett character is not as overpowering in the taste as it is in the aroma but still refreshing and fruity enough to be very enjoyable and tasty. Style calls for a Belgian Pale but I've also read and heard of it referenced as a Tripel. Regardless of its classification to a style, Orval is a unique beer and don't really know how to classify it. All I know is its a refreshing Brett Beer that is not a Belgian Pale nor a Tripel, yet far from a saison to confuse and cause much controversy when trying to fit this beer into a style. Which I wouldn't try, Orval is Orval and that's just how it is.  M: Medium bodied with a nice lingering brett funk that differs depending on the age of the bottle. I get a lot of tropical fruit from this one but can also be a bit simplistic and dry when young. High carbonation adds a tiny bit of crisp tartness but not sour at all. Just simply clean Brett character with a good carbonated backbone to balance and make for a refreshing and delicious unique beer. The one and only Orval.  O: Simple yet complicated at the same time. Refreshing and crisp while wanting to be tart and complex without being sour. A must have in my book and one damn unique Trappist brew that can be easily found and decently priced. Highly recommended to anyone.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,John_Henry,1.85,"A: Looks pretty good, as one would expect. Enormous amount of head, leaving good lacing. The head is so big it is actually too much.  S: The first thing that hits, and unfortunately a little off-putting. I racked my mind for a few minutes as it reminded me of something, but I couldn't put my finger on it. Best way I can describe it is Parma ham.  T: Pretty horrific. Lite, dry to the point of sourness. Quite bitter, but overall really rather unpleasant. Awfully disappointing.  M: Seems pretty good, but the taste is so unpleasent that it overpowers, what would potentially be a great mouth feel. I really can't even begin to process whats going o in my mouth.  O: I assumed I had a bad bottle until reading some of the other reviews. I still find it hard to believe that this isn't a bad bottle, and this is how this highly acclaimed beer is meant to taste, am I so pore of a judge? Having been an avid beer enthusiast for the last 20 years, I have to assume this just isn't for me. Strange having enjoyed pretty much every other Belgium beer I've had.  I will give this another try as this was purchased in Japan, so may well be a bad example, but unfortunately I think it may be how this beer is intended.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Bottled Date on bottle is end of Feb 2012, well within the many year recommended consumption date (2017, did I get that right?).... I'm getting a seltzery and bitter flavor I just don't think matches what I would expect of a beer of this style.  Mouthfeel is watery but somewhat creamy... Did I say watery? ...maybe the taste skewed this perception.  Finish is just... beer. sorry. Slightly bitter like.... aspirin?  overall I'm a bit disappointed.

It has an impressive large-bubbled and off-white head that leaves lacing down the glass. Aroma is Belgian yeast-forward, with the spices that implies, and a nice caramelized malt backbone. Flavours range from caramel and toffee sweetness, to hopped bitterness and coriander lemon rind.

The head stuck around for a few minutes and then dissipated into a thin bubbly edge around the sides of the glass.  S-Fruity, pineapple, hints of pepper and spice. Quite a dry smell. Hints of sweet malt as well.  T-Pineapple and citrus fruit; hints of clove, but not too much. There was a spicy dry and peppery taste in the aftertaste. Quite a complex array of flavors. The aftertaste left a slight dry and bitter feeling as well. I like Belgium beers and their complex character. However there are some Belgium beers out there that take a while to get use to. This was much different than I was expecting.  M-Full body with a lighter feel. Very refreshing and crisp to some degree! This is one of the first Belgium brews that, in my opinion, is actually sessionable. Light on the carbonation, but very refreshing.  Overall, this beer deserves hight honors and it is one the highest rated beers in my profile. This beer has been sitting in my cupboard for a year, which really made it taste so good. It is a higher 6.9%, but it felt like a lower 4-5 %. I was quite pleased with the non-alcohol taste. I have a couple more in my cupboard that I will open next year, perhaps the year after.

Light apricot flavors and a very dry finish. The head on this beer is a soft, egg white, pillow like texture which is very similar to how it feels in the mouth.

Served in a Delirium Tremens glass because my Orval goblets haven't come in the mail yet.  A: Poured a deep, ruby red color, with a slight tomato juice quality. The slightly off white, whipped cream-like head boasted about 3+ fingers and didn't go away for a while.  S: Tart and lively, yet overall, it read more like a red wine to me just based on the nose. Sorta reminded me of the same type of funkiness I commonly get from Unibroue.  T: Much different than I was expecting. I was expecting a very sweet, fruit presence, but I good something akin to biting into an unsweetened baker's chocolate bar, then realizing the error. After I got used to it, I REALLY dug it, especially the peppery, bitter finish. Not something I normally see in a Belgian brew.  M: Spritzy and champagne-like, very bitter, somewhat boozy, but not too. The lacing was ridiculous.  O: Very good beer, but not as amazing as I was hoping. Still, I respect it and then some.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Tomhet,4.52,"Appearance is a rich, cloudy brown with an amber hue when held up to light. A giant three-finger off-white head sits atop the robust body, making the prospect of tearing into this even more enticing. Talk about a complex nose. First thing that hits you is a boozy hybrid of spiced cherries, banana, sharp grapefruit, and the general Belgian yeast. The yeast logically flows into the bready malts that provide the nose's solid foundation and wonderful balance. A slight grassy/floral hop presence is notable deep in the aroma.  Taste: Very, very relaxed. Sweetness permeates the entire brew, and absolutely none of the alcohol from the nose is apparent. Those floral hops play a much larger role in the taste than the nose would indicate, and it's entirely refreshing when enjoyed under the slick, wet mouthfeel that the brew supplies. Somewhat distinctive, if not generic yeast notes are omnipresent throughout the sip, but I'm not picking up the fruit notes that the aroma indicated nearly as much as I anticipated. Carbonation is medium and crisp. Pepper rings out strong throughout. I saw a review that mentioned a “fresh-cut hay quality”, and it's right on the money. The finish is a really sweet, organic banana note that makes itself known even after you've finished taking a sip. Overall, this is perhaps the most refreshing of the Trappist ales but certainly doesn't compromise in complexity.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,tjsdomer2,4.07,Appearance: Golden-brown with lots of foam. Yeasty.  Smell: Tons of pepper and dark fruit. Very yeast too and surprisinly sweet.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Tastes mostly of pepper and yeast. Mouthfeel is not nearly as full-bodied as I'd like and I wish there was more complexity in the flavor.  Overall Drinkability: It's very rare that I find a beer disappointing but still think it's one of the better beers out there. This is worth a go.,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Pours an orange-copper colour with plenty of fluffy head that drops to a rocky cap. Glad I used the open-mouth considering the amount of head. Impressive all told.  Aroma: powerful Belgian yeasts lead the way, funnily enough. Some citric hops behind, with a touch of perhaps floral or grass also.  Taste: a touch of sweet biscuit malts and alcohol, still overpowered by the Belgian yeasts however.  Aftertaste: follows through nicely - it is definitely a good Belgian sipping ale.  Mouth feel: light to medium in body with a bubbling carbonation that carries the flavour across.  Overall: after all the massive hype surrounding this beer, I actually thought it fell short a bit. It is certainly fairly unique and quite decent, but I still reckon I could get a better beer - and far better bang for my buck - by going to something like a St Feuillien Tripel.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

A-Pours with a good deal of foamy head. Head it is quite fluffy with one large bubbles foaming. Retains the head nicely. No lacing when I tip the glass, but the head seems to retain its form very well. As I drink it down the lacing becomes much more apparent. Colour is a red-copper and very clear.  S-A fair bit of sweet malt with and a little yeasty. Some floral hops that are more summer time field than citrusy.  T-Hit with a bit of the sweet maltiness right away, which fades to a mildly funky yeast and then finally a bit of tartness. Mild grassy/citrusy hops. I think I'm also detecting a slight spicy note as well, but it doesn't pop out on every sip it seems.  M-Light in body and it kind of just dances on your tongue. Very dry finish that lingers on the mouth. Maybe a touch of alcohol, but not really noticeable.  O-It seems that all of the flavours in this beer come to play in equal quantity.

The aroma of apples is very strong, coupled with floral ideas, which complements the spectacle.  The taste, even with a slim body, but still displaying the apple theme, shows a very interesting interaction between some sourness and the hop bitter, which I thought to be fantastic.

The foam takes forever to settle, and there is nice lacing left on the glass.  S: The nose is big caramel sweetness, big sour, and big all around funk. It reminds me of raisin bread soaked in a water and lemon juice solution. Kind of like a bready gueuze.  T: This beer starts off with a big bitters and sour. The carbonation hits the palate hard, and it takes awhile for the malt notes to shine in the middle of the beer. As it moves off the palate, some funk and dryness begin to take hold.  M: Medium bodied beer. It's bitter, sour, and drying to start. Highly carbed. The middle is sweet, but that doesn't last long. The finish is super dry, slightly funky, and bitter.  O: I have mixed feelings about this beer. I like it's bitter and funk, but it's almost way too over the top. I really with this beer were a more balanced.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,EnkiduBrew,4.49,"2011 Bottle, poured into Belgian style tulip goblet.  Appearance: Slightly hazy, golden-orange when held to the light. 2.5 finger, fluffy head that lasts until the end, leaving a nice lacing. Color is reminiscent of maple leaves in early fall.  Smell: Superb Belgian yeasty goodness. Slightly phenolic with ripe citrus (mostly lemon but some pear as well) dominating (wonderfully tart). Some funky, brett-like character comes through but it does not dominate. Sessionable but extremely complex. I could drink this for days.  Taste: Lots of citrus peel comes through. Some peppery character comes through to make this not all about the citrus yeast character. Initial citrus peel flavor fades into a slight malt sweetness before a firm (but not overwhelming) hop driven bitterness ends the swallow.  Mouthfeel: Prickly. Very dry. Leaves me looking forward to take another sip.  Overall: Excellent, excellent beer. This will just be one more review of praise for Orval but it deserves it. This could easily become my favorite warm weather beers. Much different that other Belgian Pales like DeKonick (less malt driven).",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,johnnnniee,3.99,"I've passed over this peculiar looking bottle for years now, I guess today will be the day to try it. Pours into the glass a lightly hazy deep golden color with a frothy meringue head that persists forever. The label is correct about the fruitiness I get that in spades as soon as I pop the cap off the top of the bottle. Pepper, spice, yeast, and a bit of golden syrup round out the nose. The flavor is sugary sweet with a lot of orange and sweet dark fruits along with some pepper, a hint of hop and a touch of alcohol. Medium to thin body with a spirited level of carbonation and a bubbly sweet mouthfeel.

Pours nice violin-resin color with foamy head that falls to a thin layer at the top. Big sour and fruitty smell- a bit of herb but mostly light sour raspberry candy on the nose. Taste starts totally different with the malts bubbling on my tongue with the yeast and fruit coming at the roof and candie with sour dry aftertaste. The sour notes stick lightly to the roof of the mouth and sides of the tongue after but it's relaxing. That's a damn good one!,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,Lolli1315,4.62,"A- Golden orange with a billowing egg shell white head. The head is pillowy and resilient as about a half finger sticks around. It is slightly hazy and leaves behind a sticky lacing.  S- Tart fruits with a reasonable amount of lemon. Some medicinal and phenolic smells with little underlying malt sweetness. Some earthy musty character as well.  T- The lemon and citrus flavors are not as pronounced in the taste although they can be tasted lingering in the background. Medicinal and other phenolic flavors are apparent throughout the beer. The earthy, musty, slightly barnyard characteristic starts in the middle of the beer and carries through the finish. Slightly tart, but certainly not mouth puckering and it is not off putting. Slight hop bitterness in the finish.  M- Medium, maybe medium light body. Carbonation is slightly prickly on the tongue at first, but it has become more smooth as the beer has settled. Finish is dry as well.  O- A great belgian pale ale and the earthy character makes this both different from others in the same style as well as providing it with a little more character. As a person who edges towards the funky/sour end, this is my type of beer, but likely not offensive to others who do not prefer funk all that much.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

A: Darker gold in color with a bit of haze (tried to be careful with any yeast) and a huge creamy off white head.  S: Big fruity and musty aromas; floral in a really pleasant way. Orange peel, lemon peel, funk, earthy Brett, even some faint tropical fruit, pear, a good amount of white grape skins, and hints of raisins. Pretty similar to muscat white wine.  T: Same as the nose, fruity and funky; citrus rind, musty and earthy Brett. Definite lemon and even lime (reminiscent of Sprite actually as this beer seems to be heartily carbonated initially). White wine...a bit of barnyard begins to take hold as it warms. There is some hop bitterness, so this beer isn't overly sweet or tart.  MF: Fairly light to medium bodied, with some nice carbonation. Finishes with a Bretty dryness and notes of hop bitterness.  O: Really unique and diverse, and at the end of the night I liked it. Definitely a sipper and something to enjoy as it warms and different flavors emerge. This bottle is around 10 months old, and I'm sure older bottles taste vastly different because of the Brett.

37,129,Hoppsbabo,4.23,"EDIT: Sat on this for at least six months and I think it had aged considerably. Had some Orvals since this review and they were sublime, far better than my aged version.  A: Dulled copper. Some strings of champagne bubbles barely visable. Large off white head, typical of quality Belgian pale ale. Looks great.  S: Whiffing from the bottle I get a most beautiful scent of fruity hops which is strong but refined and delicate. From the glass it's a different story. The hops are overwhelmed by a second vinegary pong which is very pungent. Is this what people mean by horse blanket? Absolutely foul!  T: Very dry and bitter. Pleasant bath watery hops with delicate earthiness. A perfumey citrus fragrance breezes across the tongue and pervades in the finish with a not so prominent bread flavour. It has that kind of English hop profile that I associate with bathwater but it's a refined one. Again, very bitter. Reminds me of when I have trouble swallowing a paracetamol and the bitterness lingers.  O: A real quality beer, no doubt about that, but I found it too dry and bitter. Wouldn't be a problem if it were balanced accordingly but from my experience bitter hops in Belgians tend to stick out like a sore thumb. It's definitely an interesting beer however and I'll have it again.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Danny1217,4.83,"Hazy orange amber with a fluffy white head. Lots of nice lacing and excellent retention. The head lasts forever. Smells a bit floral, and somewhat funky. Some lemon zest. Taste is slightly fruity. A bit of tartness and a brett funk. A nice hop bite gives some slight citrus flavors. Lots of tart fruit tastes. Extraordinarily smooth and crisp feel. Highly sessionable, yet incredibly complex. A balance that is hard to find.  This is one incredible beer. The only downside is that they are a bit pricey, being sold only as single bottles for over $5 each. If not for the price, I could drink quite a few of these in one evening.  After having had it a couple times relatively fresh in the states, I drank an aged Orval while in Belgium. It was possibly the best beer I ever drank. The brett takes over and leaves the fruit and hop flavors in the background. It is funky perfection.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Cloudy light orange, lots of lace as the head dissipated. S ~ Some barnyard funk, wild berries...actually not too much else that I could pick up on. T ~ The funk is stealing the show here. I'm getting a peppery taste as well, and a slight touch of medicine. Very dry and no sweetness whatsoever. M ~ Light, and very carbonated O ~ I was very excited to post my first review; and thought this would be a great start with the #2 ranked BPA!

Golden orange body. Carbonation is very apparent.  S: This smells incredible. Both sweet and funky from the mix of the fruity Orval yeast and the funky brett but neither is overpowering. Slight aroma from the hops. Just what I was hoping for.  T: Mix of bit sweet bread from the cara and pale malts, spiciness, tart, funk from the yeast and bitterness from the hops. Great - Complex and unique but I think this could better.  M: Low-medium body. Would prefer a little more body actually. Crispy and very carbonated. Maybe a bit too much for my liking. But smooth as fuck, and refreshing.  O: This brew stands out from the other Trappist beers in a number of ways.

The biggest head I've ever seen by a mile. Nice lacing as it finally subsides, but most of the head hangs around.  Smell: Woah this is quite pleasant. Nice fruity esters, with lemon pith, a light mango, and some pear. A light white pepper and some biscuity yeast. Was hoping for a Bretty funk, but there is none.  Taste: Follows the nose, but is subdued. Less fruit and more of an earthiness. Some grass. A light funk. Some sweet biscuits close.  Mouthfeel: Pretty watery, surprisingly. A light bitterness. Prickly carb, but not to the extent the head might make you believe.  Overall: Finally went for this classic, and it did not disappoint!

Looks very inviting.  Smell is not very present at first. Some slight spices and hops. Later some caramel, cloves, malts, citrus, and a very slight burt smell. It smells fantastic, but still a bit faint.  Taste has notes of yeast and mats, before the big hops kick in. Lots of fruit, green apples, lemon, grapefruit. A nice bitterness, but not overprowering at all, it's balanced very nicely by some light malt and a hint of sweetness. Then some spices, but not as much as on the nose. Aftertase is more grapefruit. After it has warmed up a,ittle the yeast comes through more. This is really balanced and complex.  Mouth is light, and full of carbonation, It pricks even a bit. I love big carbonation.  I love this beer. The smell and taste are really good, and it has a nice carbonation that I like. It's nowhere near any other trappist beer though, it's closer to an IPA even, which is why I don't score the overall a 5.

37,129,tectactoe,4.27,"Had this quite a while ago - figured it was time to do a re-review and see how it went this time around. Orval pours a rustic amber color; opaque for the most part, though some light passes through at the edges of the glass without much trouble. The huge, cream-colored cap is something to marvel at; it remains thick and lasts seemingly for days, leaving huge sheets of lace along the sides of the glass.  The aroma contains a quick, sharp tartness that hints at a combination of orange and lemon zest. Bigger inhales reveal a nice tropical-like fruitiness, highly akin to pineapple - this is most likely from the Brett, which also brings a swift bit of funk to the plate; like a slightly musty, mostly sweaty barnyard. Juicy green hops in the finish show signs of grass, leaves, and light citrus. The nose on this is really unique, and fantastic in it's own right.  The first sip starts off like a carbon copy of the first whiff - a surly tartness hits your palate right away, followed by some calming waves of orange peels and lemon zest. The pineapple is apparent as well, though in more of of a stinging, bitter pith fashion than a juicy, sweet kind. Hops are plentiful; leafy, grassy, dry, citrusy, and quite bitter for a Belgian ale. Again, very discernible and quite complex.  Brettanomyces abound in the latter half of each sip, bringing some musty cellar, mellow barnyard, and stale cork flavors to the table. The finish contains a subtle amount of citrus zest and yeasty funk with a lasting bitterness from the dry hopping. This stuff is carbonated to the brim, giving it a sharp, crisp mouth feel; effervescent and light, despite the medium stature of the body.  Orval is a pretty awesome trappist ale. I guess when you only brew one beer, you have more time to test, tweak, and perfect it, and it seems like the monks at Brasserie d'Orval have done just that. On most days I'd say that this is not my favorite trappist ale, although it always stands out to me as the most unique. The Brett and the dry-hopping really set it apart from the others and always keep me coming back to this funny, oblong bottle.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Dry with a some bite in the finish and a nice lingering bitterness. Very well carbonated with a great mouthfeel. Very drinkable. Not one to gulp down, but take a sip and then you will quickly take another and another. Overall this is one of the big classic Belgians you pretty much have to try.

It’s just slightly underwhelming really. It’s still good, but not quite elite, unfortunately.  M – The mouthfeel is very nice, I will concede that. Rather light body, a ton of carbonation, dry finish.  O – Overall it’s good. But it’s not unbelievable, and not the best trappist ale that I have had.

Brewed 7/10/2010 [ BB 7/10/2015 ]  A: Pours a slightly cloudy orange amber with a huge light tan head that hangs out forever. Giant bubbles. I actually put my ear up to the head and the sound was amazing; snap! crackle! pop! at such intense levels. Wow...  S: A lot of banana and sweet cinnamon blended with tartness. Some pine.  T: Very bready but also extremely tart. Almost like a bitter apple pie but not nearly as sweet.  M: Very light and bubbly on the tongue. Smooths over leaving a light film of flavor. Not overly carbonated. Goes down making you want more.  This beer was amazing. I'm sitting here looking at my last sips wondering when I'll pick up another. I think because of the age of this beer it may be more sour making it all the more enjoyable. I'd certainly like to try a fresh one but for now I am ok with small, humble and sometimes dusty (but not expensive).",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,mschind,4.63,"A- This bottle is good until 6-2016. Been sitting here for 10 minutes waiting for the two inch meringue like mocha colored head to dissipate and it shows no sign of doing so. Clear dark gold with amber tints and a big cloud of bubbles. The foam is very sticky and really coats the glass. (tulip)  S- Floral and fruit with mild hops and light malt and the unique scent of the Belgian yeast strain.  T- The taste is drier than the nose would suggest. Starts faintly sweet with pear like notes whiich quickly shifts to a slightly bitter middle and then some yeast before a balanced but dry finish.  M- Clean, medium light body with some warm alcohol at the back.  O- Perhaps the best Belgian pale on the market.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,afrokaze,4.26,"Bottled on 8/18/2011, poured into a dessert wine glass because it's the most suitable choice my parents have around the house.  Pours a pale cloudy gold/orange with crazy carbonation swirling in the glass and a huge rocky dense head that sticks around forever with good lacing.  Aroma is interesting, tons of straight brett funk that's clean and not too musty, slight peach/green apple citrus, flowers, metallic notes, clove, peppercorns, some banana.  Green apple tart up front leads to clean soft malt, clove, light citrus/green apple, ripe pears, hay, some spicy hops and a pronounced dry mineral finish. So complex I can't even really describe, you just sip and peel away layers of flavor. Alcohol is almost nonexistant  Mouthfeel is tight and prickly, but smooths out in the finish. Dry but has just enough sweetness in the end to keep it from being overly tannic. Sits on the palate for a long time but isn't cloying, lets you really sift through the flavors.  A beautiful and crazy beer, I can see why so many rave about it. Really nothing else like it, super complex and light enough to be refreshing but really satisfying to sip and admire. This is gonna be an obsession!",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,blatantdream,4,Interesting fact: Uses 3 type of yeast and is the only Trappist brewery to do a Pale Ale style.  Light amber in color. Cloudy with a creamy light head.  The aroma is very yeasty with distinctive floral and spiced characteristics.  Unique soft malty flavors with slight spices and moderate lingering hop characters rounding out the taste.  Medium bodied with medium carbonation lends to a balance mouthfeel.  Overall good welcomed differentiation from other Trappist beers. Unique but very balanced and clean tasting.,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Douberd,4.24,"ABV 6,2% I got this beer at my local liquor store without knowing anything about it. It was just another option among all the other beers on the shelf. After coming home though and reading all those positive reviews, I was looking forward to drinking it. Instead, for a bunch of reasons, it stayed in my fridge till now. A uniquely shaped bottle of 330 ml, with just one small, modest label mentioning the beer's name and other info, around the neck of the bottle. Poured into a chalice, after letting it warm up a little bit, since it has a recommended drinking temperature of 12°-14° C. Dark amber coloured, with a two finger head, white in colour, with some yelow spots every here and there.. Foam is thick in texture. Quite a few bubbles rising to the surface. Head has an average retention.Once most of it is gone, a thick enough part stays behindand covers the surface. Aroma was quite complex when I sniffed it the moment I opened the bottle, with the most obvious smell being a fig aroma.. After smelling it from the glass, I sense plums, pears, some light caramel aromaand maybe some old redgrapes. Great aroma. Taste is great too, somehow in the middle between fruity sweet and hoppy bitter, with the scale turning on the bitterness' side when it comes to the aftertaste. It's very difficult to name some flavours exactly. There are fruity flavours, some clove too. Now I perceive some white wine flavour and some spices too. This beer is so complex, to the point you get another flavour with every sip. Alcohol very well concealed. Full body with average carbonation, a bit tart on the palate. Overall, a fantastic beer. Its complexity makes for a great sipping beer. Those monks are doing a great job at their brewery.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,gtermi,4.08,"A: This beer pours a golden body with a thick white head that quickly fades.  S: There really isnt much to the smell of this beer other than a slight bit of funk, some grain and alcohol.  T: The first thing I get is the strong grain flavor, but then it turns into a yeasty flavor... As the beer lingers I start to get a nice sweetness and even a little sugar type flavor. There really isnt much, but a little goes a long way with this beer.  M: There is a nice crispness on the back of the throat and the tip of the tonuge. It has a nice full body and makes the beer feel thick as it goes down.  O: This is a very nice beer. I wouldnt say its one of the best in the world, but it is very tasty.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

The head was impressive S- Not much to smell but hints of fruit T- autumn fruit flavored M- Crisp, carbonated taste, not as smooth as I like most belgians with a little too much carbonation. O- I typically like Trappist Ales, especially Pale Ales, but this one didn't make me want to order another. Still better than the average beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,spoony,3.51,"From a 11.2 oz bottle into a tulip.  A-Nice golden honey color with a thick, off-white head. The head is quite impressive...it really sticks around.  S-Floral notes dominate for me. I also picked up a few subtle notes of apple and some funk. Not a strong nose.  T- Some hay and floral flavors. A touch of apple and cracker. Not much funk.  M-Crisp with a lighter body and pleasant carbonation.  O-I wanted to like this beer, but I was not blown away. I found it rather simple. Perhaps I have ruined my palate by drinking too many crazy IPAs recently, but this one was underwhelming. It drinks easily, but I expected more intrigue for the $5 per 11.2 oz I paid for my two bottles recently.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Living816,3.4,"Oh my the hype. These ratings would imply orgasm like flavors / experience in the mouth. Perhaps the beer pays *me* to drink it?  It pours a rather curious straw, stained oak color with some haze. The head is amazingly robust, persisting for an eternity.  The ""brett funk"" hits your straightaway along with a bit of sweet aroma, like a syrup. The smell betrays you. The taste is nothing like it.  On the mouth, there is an exceeding dryness and astringency that seems to suck the moisture right out of your mouth. There is a bit of sour, which is obviously anticipated. But the sour doesn't seem to fit in. It just sloshes around in the mouth.  A bit more bitterness on the finish than you expect as well.  I don't know that I would buy it again. It's quite flat, one dimensional. The sour simply is there for, well, I don't know why its there. It's just a bolt on to a typical trappist ale.

Massive fluffy head with a rather ugly light tan color. Massive bubbles that took a nice swirling to clean up. Tons of lacing and retention.  S - Perfect. This is the definitive Brettanomyces aroma. A barnyard funk that is pleasant but approaching offensive, light grass and lemons, just a touch of biscuity crackers and ripe apples on the finish. Some warming alcohol as well.  T - Funky hay, rich cheese, lemon grass, pears, crackers, chalk, sweet caramel and a subtle minty herbal finish. This beer is just so complex. I'm just getting so many odd and unique flavors that I'm struggling to pinpoint them all. Yet it comes off as well balanced and simple. Its just...Orval. I've never had a beer taste like this. Mouth feel is effervescent and well carbonated.  O - Theres nothing quite like this beer. Matilda and Rayon Vert may be homages to this beer, but they just can't compete with the insane complexity and high drinkability of this. Age has also turned this into a brett bomb. World class for sure.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Goblinmunkey7,4,"Appearance: Dark caramel gold the color of a super ripe banana. Slight haze. Head is pillowy, massive, and off-white. Slightly sticky lacing. Solid carbonation. Head drops to a chunky cap and collar.  Smell: Banana, powdery yeast. Apples and pears. Some candi sugar and caramel sweetness. Slightly bready. A touch of melon rind and straw. Slight pale malt coupled with darker caramel malts. Touch of phenols on the back. Faint Brett backing. Clove and banana.  Taste: Yeast. Powdery and mildly earthy. Ripe banana and some mild spiciness. Clove and some phenol. Touches of caramel, candi sweetness, and some graham cracker. Biscuit and hay. Pale malts. Slightly cooked grains. Belgian yeast and a nice earthy finish.  Mouthfeel: Moderate to light body with a solid carbonation. Very clean.  Overall: Odd, very odd. Heavy Belgian influence, but so earthy it's confusing.

37,129,BrownNut,3.92,"Bottle to tulip.  A - Orange-gold. Substantial off white head of fine bubbles that endures for a long time  S - Slightly bretty, or is that candi? Maybe both. Maybe a little winey. It's somewhat faint and hard to pin down.  T/M - It's got a signature flavor and feel that I'm coming to associate with offerings from several Trappist breweries. It reminds me of St. Bernardus 12 and Rochefort 10 even though those are different styles. All have a sharp, light, tingliness, a lighter overall feel than I expect in any of those cases, and with more of a carbonation sting than I want, almost like a miniature shadow of Pop Rocks. Some of that sharpness in this case takes on a kind of appley character, with some of the bitterness of skin tannins and leaning towards the tartness of a green apple. There's a suggestion of candi sugar. Earlier sips seemed sweeter and thicker, while later ones are sharper and thinner, though I get the sweetness on the exhale. Finishes dry and tannic.  O - This beer was kind of a journey from start to finish. It's interesting and its quality shines through. That's what I want on my beer safari. I'm not sure I've quite figured it out yet and will definitely want to get it again. Thumbs up.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Now, I am reaching the realization that this is even more complex than I once thought. This does not really taste like a Belgian Pale Ale. Yes, it has pale ale malts, but it's also very flowery, had some sour/funk notes, and kind of tastes like a white wine. Bonus points for uniqueness.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,TBoneJones,4.92,"Drawn to this bottle for some reason. Bready boozy smell at outset. Cider-like color with thick lacing. The best part of this brew for me is the complexity. At first taste I do sense the yeast, the astringency is there as others will agree here. I may seem off a bit in this but vinegar comes to mind as a mouth sensation, if you can somehow picture that in a good way. I guess there is an odd abrasiveness that somehow ""works"". Yes it is quite dry, however I can't help, and can hardly believe, that I also detect fruit or fig in the taste. As I mentioned, this is all about complexity. The mouthfeel for me is most abrasive up front, but it is up front where i also smell the fruit-like bouquet as I am tasting it. For some reason and I can't pinpoint exactly how, but this is very drinkable for a beer with such a distinct character. Spices are picked up too. Unusual. I guess the reason i think Orval is so good despite some unusual characteristics is due to the expertise in the brewery of using their ""brettanomyces"" yeasts the way they do. Apparently in most beers these yeasts are considered contaminants. With that it's no wonder I also favor saisons. All good here.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,bnes09,2.51,Pale orange in color with a nice haze. Mountainous head forms and retains well. Soapy character to the head with descent lacing.  Aroma is pretty clean. Ginger and faint wheat bread.  Flavor seems off. Somewhat bitter and tart. Rough malt character and stale hops. Off flavor continues in the finish.  Lighter body and a it on the watery side. Overcarbonated as well.  Totally disappointing. I wonder if I got a bad batch or if this particular bottle was stored improperly for some time causing it to go sour. I'll probably rechallenge this some other time to make sure.,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Jesse13713,4.34,"Bottled 10/02/2011  Appearance - An extremely rich pour that boasts a luscious soapy head. The foam dissipates quickly, leaving behind a half finger of creamy residue. Drowned in opaqueness, this caramelized brown and yellow Trappist ale appears fresh and sweet. Poured into a Hoppin' Frog Snifter, carbonation hugs the waist of the glass and curls upwards rapidly. Perhaps some of the strongest lacing I've ever seen; like honey coating a honeycomb.  Smell - A bit of a Belgian yeast funk to the nose. A string of fruity chords; primarily cherries, melons, and faint raspberries. Light and pleasing to the senses, but nothing extravagant.  Taste - Exceptionally smooth. Light cherries and strawberries reward the swallow. Fuzzy, appropriate, under-powered ethanol coats over the tongue like a warm cotton blanket. A bit of a sweet candy taste linger on the roof of the mouth; almost like de-soured Smarties. There is a lot of complexity in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability - Delightful as it coats the palate. Smooth, balanced, refreshing; everything this ale should be. Spritzes the tongue with fresh fruits and a drop of ethanol.

Some bready malt but its quite underplayed. Overall an impecible slightly bitter fruity sourness with real balance.  Taste has a crisp, slight biscuit malt, citrus hops and a soft brett estery sourness, barnyard comes through a bit. Some florals, winey sourness and a complex citrus hop bitterness but a great caramel semi-sweet malt body throughout. The taste is quite rich, with steller complexity, a light minerally touch. The finish is dry, straw, and pleasantly malty.  Mouthfeel has a moderate caramel roasty malt body with some soft carbonation to give a nice refreshing feel. Really nice and drinkable. A solid amount of body but a nice alcohol warmth to boot.  Really quite impeccable beer. It deserves to be hyped, and avoids going overboard on any respects, maintaining a quite complexity and great drinkability.

Used to love this beer and previously rated it a 4.6, but it's now been quite a while since i've been drinking a really great one  A- Unattractive, murky dark orange, with some brighter shades if seen through light. Healty, dense 2 fingers white head that shows very good retention while also leaving loads of lacing on the sides of the glass  S- Fresh and sharply bitter herbal/grassy aroma with an earthy/bretty note on the back of things. Some citric hints may also be detected  T- A slight touch of malt sweetness (caramel) is soon overwhelmed by a strong yeasty character, which brings notes of funk along with a bit of spiciness. Nice dose of hop bitterness (though maybe not as bitter as the smell suggested), with strong citric (definitely lemon) and grapefruit notes in evidence. Overall slighty more on the earthy side than the smell suggested  M- Medium to full bodied with quite strong, sharp carbonation. Very lively on the tongue, still decently creamy on the palate thanks to the everlasting head. Very much a raw mouthfeel  O- Has a quite unique, peculiar bittering profile that does not make it an easy drinker, though i would still consider this one as a quite refreshing ale.

Superb.  Incredibly fresh, pungent, hoppy, and funky aroma, even after 2+ years of aging in my cellar. There's lots of citrus, white fruits like apples and pears, mild funk, earth, hay, and grass. This is what I look for in a Belgian pale.  The flavor is more bitter and funk-forward than I would have imagined after experiencing the aroma. There's still good amounts of white fruit, earthiness, and grass flavors, but the bitterness and funk are dominant. Mind you, I'm not complaining.  Medium bodied with high carbonation.

Monster, slightly off-white head with some big, big bubbles forming.Leaves a nice lacing. Pleasing stringers of tiny bubbles abound.  S - Suprisingly unfragrant, but what there is is nice. Orange citrus, spicy/peppery, subtle notes of Brett on the the first sniff - ""wet hay"" - but not much after. Hadn't realised this was going to be a bit sour - nice surprise!  T - Whoa! Again, another surprise. Was expecting malt from the colour, but dominant impression is ""structural"" - bitter, hoppy, very, very dry, slightly yeasty, slightly sour. Very little fruit. Mineral, flinty character, almost like a chablis. Front edge is all bitterness, with the mouthfeel (if not flavour) of banana-y esters, easing out into very light citrus zest, then a long tail of... all sorts. Definite notes of bitter leafy greens - rocket, dandelion. Bitter hops. Woody deliciousness, with a hint of oak. Peppery. Gets gradually sweeter. For a fairly strong beer though, surprisingly thin/watery. Flavours are great, but quite subtle. First thought was ""What the...?"", but a few mouthfuls later, was fantastic.  M - Nice. Very light, high carb. Almost champagne-like. Perhaps a little watery.  O - Very unusual; very nice.

T - A very pleasant bitter mixed with a slight yeast comes in just before the carbonation. The carbonation and taste are tasted at the same time, even though the carbonation level is high. Quite delightful. Barnyard funk comes in afterward with dandelion. Unusual, but delicious.  M - Good amount of carbonation, exemplary representation of the style.  Wow. What a delight.

S: A mixture of citrus and brett funk work very well together. This beer smells quite dry but I get a good amount of lemon and grapefruit from the yeast. Very nice.  T: Bitter and dry, I get some brett funkiness in the way of wet hay, but do not get any of the citrus that I got in the aroma.

M: Very light with very high prickly carbonation.  O: I remember this being better on previous occasions. The aroma was a very nice mixture of citrus and funkiness, but the flavor didn't quite pack the intensity I was expecting from the aroma. Decent nonetheless.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,rdespain,5,"One of the most original and funkiest beers ever made! Drinking it makes me feel like I am walking through a hay field during the early harvest. Lots of cows grazing around in the fields, freshly pollinated flowers, and funky fresh smells all on the wind. Love the beer, have had it fresh (less than three months old) and aged (3+ years in bottle), and I love it every time. Every bottle is different but the funk and the pure farm freshness remains each time.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Deconstructionis,4.36,"Deep orange color with a slight haze and a more robust head than expected. The aroma is very yeasty with fruit overtones and a bit of spice. The taste is complex, quite malty with spice, to the sweet side but just a trace of bitterness and less pronounced fruit than the aroma. The yeast tang is there but less predominant than with many Belgians. The body is medium heavy and it has medium high carbonation.  Overall, it's a very distinctive beer and one I would recommend even to those who shy from trappist ales.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,JohnnyHopps,4.04,"Poured into a snifter, the aroma was an immediate pineapple scent. By far, this was the highlight for me. Giving a slight head, the ale was a pale yellow with a moderate degree of cloudiness. The first taste sensation was a mild banana flavor which did not last long. Of course, this was the Belgian yeast shining though. The banana was accompanied by a tart woody flavor with a lemon notes. In some ways, the lemon reminded me of a saison. The flavors were balanced on an earthy backbone with a slightly sour aftertaste. It became obvious that this was a pale ale at this point. This Belgian pale ale was a unique experience. While I enjoyed it, I found myself wanting more from the beer. The Belgian yeasts seemed smothered by the other flavors.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Sharkophile,4.38,"A: Poured into a goblet. Appears a gorgeous, murky dark orange with some shades of brown. Crowned with an big, dense white head with excellent retention. Looks excellent.  S: Smells very fruity, with some apple, strawberry and banana flavors thrown around. Also some earthy funk, grain and booze evident.  T: Oh boy... initially grainy and fruity, with apple-y and subtle banana flavors. Then comes the funk, with a big, earthy, peppery spiciness with some vanilla and bitter flavors. Finishes dry with some grainy sweetness and some residual peppery flavors. Very different. I like.  M: Medium body with a smooth, creamy carbonation which suits the beer perfectly.  O: A terrific beer with a completely unique flavor profile. The earthiness of from the yeast, hops and brett make for a terrific, in-your-face drinking experience.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

S- Undeniable Belgian yeast strain peppery spiciness. It's like a candied funk, hard to describe (albeit undeniable..yeah!).  T- Pale malts, ""grape skin"", some funk, bubble gum. So much going on. Tasty. Subtle sweet aftertaste. Hard to detect any alcohol, just want to keep drinking.  M- Creamy medium mouthfeel with prickly carbonation bubbles.  D/O- The first sip of this beer is like a kick in the gonads but in your mouth. ""What is this!?"" Subsequent imbibing produces a flurry of happy chemical release in my brain. Really like nothing I've had before. This is classic. Highly recommended for Belgian beer fans.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Hopdaemon39,4.38,"Poured from a 33 cl bottle into a tulip- pours a slightly hazy golden orange color with a 3-finger head, pretty decent retention, nice lacing. Fine looking Belgian.  Smell is nice- that patent Belgian yeast smell; earthy. Plus a little malt sweetness.  Tastes a little less exciting than I was imaging but you can really taste lots of different flavors- very well balanced. A little funk, a little earthiness, some nice pale malt sweetness, with a little hop bitterness as well. Great that you can actually taste the hops. A little stale though.  Mouthfeel is great- light to medium body with full carbonation. Not my favorite golden belgian but certainly worth trying for the complexity of flavor. And an excellent beer.  Update: As I continue to drink it (it's been about an hour now), the yeast REALLY dominates the flavor; almost as if it's totally consumed the malt. Still some hops.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Grape skin, apple, pie crust, some light hop bitterness. Very fruity and juicy.  M. Light bodied, highly carbonated, crisp mouthfeel, some lingering bitterness from fruit rinds and hops.  O.

Dominated by yeast (clove, pepper and spices), it's also very flowery with a nice touch of sweetness besides some hop. I also pick out some dark fruits. A delight for the noze!  T - Taste is rather acid, quite lemony, mineral. I'm a bit disappointed since it doesn't feature all the complexity of the smell.  M - Medium-light body with very active carbonation on the tongue. It's a bit over-carbonated to my taste. The finish is quite dry.  O - Featuring an old school character, an amazing appearance and a great taste, this beer is such an experience.

37,129,Bibendum,3,"Orval has changed. It no longer has it's trademark peppery nose, and a head too big to contain that leaves frothy tracings around the edge of the goblet all the way to the bottom. I have known Orval since 1979, when I worked for Merchant du Vin. It is a favorite beer that I rarely drink for reasons of cost. However I received 6 bottles as a gift recently that were dated 20-5-11. And to my surprise there was no peppery nose, instead the smell of bubblegum. I did not have to pour with great care to contain the head, in fact I could and did pour it down the center. Something I could not have done 3 years ago. So today I had one from another batch, this one dated 18-08-11. This one did not smell of bubblegum, but neither did it have it's trademark peppery nose or irrepressible head. Orval either has a recent quality control problem, or they have intentionally changed their brew. In either case I'm unhappy. Bring back the old Orval, please.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

S: The aroma was mainly yeasty and malty sweet with hints of citrus and perhaps an earthy aroma, grass or flower.  T: The taste of the beer is outstanding, exactly what I would expect for this style. A very nice Belgian yeast flavor with nice hints of the citrus hops that had a nice bit to it that finished with a nice long lasting dry finish. The beer also had a slight taste of alcohol as the beer warmed.  Overall, this is an excellent beer that was extremely easy to drink. It was smooth and crisp and a lighter body than most Belgian beers. Back to the beer store to pick up more.

The head looks like a creamy cloud floating on top on a beautiful golden river.  S-Nice fruity scent, seems to be a mix between malt and yeast scents. Maybe a hint of spicy hops, or some sort of spice.  turning on some Clapton to enjoy this one to. ""and i say yes, you look wonderful tonight"" sounds like this beer.  T-A bit citrusy, definitely a malty beer. Very spicy hop at the end. Not bitter at all though. Very citrusy malt up front bringing the citrus out towards the middle, while introducing a spice note to build into the finish.  MF-Nice medium body, a bit creamy on the aftertaste but with a dryness in the mouth.  O-I have never had a belgian pale ale before. I have had a handful of other belgians though and this is much different. Not in a bad way though.

The first thing that I notice on the nose is some kind of white wine character - grapes, bitter fruits, etc. Plenty of hop presence with some estery goodness in there. Certainly is a unique tasting beer. Not quite as vibrant as I was hoping. The notes that build the aroma just aren't here on the palate. This one has a year on it, so I guess this beer might just be in an awkward phase because the look and smell suggest something greater and more pronounced.

A: Pours a nice bronze with a mild haziness. Half-finger white head forms with average visible carbonation.  S: Sweet malts, Belgian fruity yeast esters, some acetone and a bit of alcohol heat.  T: Sweet candied malt, caramel, fruity yeast esters (grapes and berries), a touch of funk, and finishes fairly dry.  M: Medium body, good carbonation sensation. The alcohol presence is certainly noticeable, though it doesn't seem ""hot"".  O: Truly a quality old standby.

A gigantic two finger head that just stuck and didnt move.  Smell- Its a classic all right. Undeniable Belgian yeast with a good amount of musty cheesy funk but not overpowering. A bit earthy and damp as well.  Taste- Well its all over the place for me really but not clouded or muddled. Has a large damp citrus flavor and carries over a large chunk of yeasty grassy funk.

37,129,seancake,5,"What can I possibly say about this beer that hasn't already been said? The most idiosyncratic beer ever made. Not like any other beer you will EVER drink -- unless it's specifically designed to mimic Orval. Even then, it won't quite manage it.  Orval is also incredible in how much it changes with age. I can't say that I prefer a bottle with age to a young bottle, they are entirely different beasts. Thanks to cafés serving different vintages here in Belgium (Kulminator in Antwerpen, Dubh-Linn in Langdorp for example), I have had them ranging from a very young, green two months all the way to 6 years' age. They are beautiful young or old. The young tends towards a fresh light hoppiness, and an aged bottle has a creamier quality with the bretts coming forth more.  A true classic, dry-finish and wonderful washing-powder aroma, gorgeous off-white head, mouthfeel that is creamy and light all at the same time, I can't really describe it fully. You can drink one, or you can drink five (though it's quite a bit stronger than, say, your average pilsner and you do so at your own risk). All I can say is that it's the only beer logo I am considering tattooing on my body -- that's how much I adore and revere this beer.

The dense, bright white head is two fingers and lasts for the duration. Beautiful lacing. I am having a hard time finding any reason not to give this a 5, so I will.  S - Lemon peel, pepper, clove, and a tiny bit of vinegar-like funk. Some bready malt rounds out the smell and gives it a a little bit of richness.  T - The taste is spicy and earth-like with some lemon zest and Belgian yeast. The flavor is crisp and refreshing, but it leaves a strong astringent aftertaste that I am not enjoying. It improves as I drink more, but I am very sensitive to the chemical-astringent taste that is left behind.  M - Aggressive carbonation and a light feel. Leaves my mouth dry, yet refreshed.  O - I was impressed by the appearance, smell, and mouthfeel of this beer. The flavor had all of the elements I was looking for, but there was an additional astringent aftertaste I was not pleased with.

37,129,rickyleepotts,2.43,"There is a lot of talk about Trappist beers. It’s a cool concept… beers that are made by monks, within a monastery that produce $0 in profit. All of the money made either goes back into the brewery/monastery or is donated to charity. Now that is what I like to call drinking for a purpose! It’s just funny to me to think that monks made this. Seems wrong. Oh well, I have heard great things about this beer… so let’s see. It is the only beer this brewery makes, so it better be tasty!  In the Glass: There were a TON of bubbles when I poured it into the glass, but it quickly settled. It has a crisp, clean, and carbonated look to it in the glass. It is compared to a champagne-like carbonation, so I will try to keep an open mind here as I try this famous beer.  Nose: It doesn’t smell like beer, that’s for sure. It smells like flowers. No, I’m serious… smell this and tell me you don’t get a big nose full of flowers. It also has a somewhat dry sweetness to it too… I wonder what she tastes likes.  Flavor: Those bubbles are NOT on the tongue, that’s for sure. There is a sublet bitterness at the start, that leads to a dry finish and then the hops sort of kick in toward the middle back half of the palate. Then it’s gone. Not sure what the fuss is about here… this beer is just OK.  Mouthfeel: When I poured it, there were tons of bubbles. I assumed there would be a ton on the tongue. There weren’t. I am not saying that is a bad thing. It doesn’t really taste like beer, either. The mouthfeel is smooth, silky, then dry as it quickly disappears on the back of the tongue.  Aftertaste: What aftertaste? There really isn’t one. All of the flavor happens in the middle as you swallow, then it’s gone. The burp is pretty weak too. Come on monks… you can do better than this! The bottle is cool… saddle, the best part of this beer. That, and the history behind it. Past that, skip it. There are better beers out there.

Smells of caramel, raisins, honey,biscuity and a small presence of maltyness and a kiss of hops. On the taste the aroma's really stand out individualy. First, starts off with the sweetness of the raisins and honey. Mid-way the biscuit and breadyness really kicks you in the face! Finishes with the biterness of the small hops present and a touch of plums. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with high carbonation for this style, imo.

Hints of pineapple, mango, orange, and grapefruit. Also some hints of banana, apple, pear, and dark plums and raisins. Some noticeable candied sugar and a mild presence of earthy hops. The complex fruits really stand out.  Taste: Like the smell, a big complex mix of fruits with yeast and some hops. A good amount of Belgian yeast adds some balancing spice. Among the big taste of fruit are notes of banana, pineapple, mango, grapefruit, orange, lemon, apple, pear, sugar, and some subtle dark raisin and plum. Hints of earthy hops in the background. A very complex and great taste.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full body with a medium to high level of carbonation. Chewy and prickly. Finishes fairly dry.  Overall: An amazing ale.

The nose is somewhat subdued, yeasty, and slightly fruity. I'm getting pears, apples, and some flowery hop notes. I don't get any Brett notes on the nose.  The taste is quite dry and appetizing and the mouthfeel is firm and lively from the carbonation, especially at the back of the mouth. There is a mild biscuity malt flavor in the front of the palate. This is followed by a nice soft champagne-like dryness at mid-palate. There is a very faint, almost lemony, Brett sourness in the back of the mouth. The finish is mild and a bit disappointing. For me, those sour notes just don't linger very well.  This beer has an interesting combination of appetizing dryness and slight, acidic sourness. The sourness is not biting, but rather just a bit of a pinch to add to the finish and let you know it's there.

A strangely strong, yet mellow tart bitter hop flavor builds until the middle, dry malt on the finish, and that Belgian yeast is present throughout.  Beer with a bite, lively, and very drinkable.

37,129,Converge,3.57,"330ml bottle poured into a 16oz tulip.  A - Pours with a big head of light tan bubbles, although it's rather short-lived. The color is a murky rusty-copper, with ample yeasty cloudiness. Not much head retention or lacing to speak of.  S - Smells complex and nothing like I had expected. Lots of dark fruits, a touch a anise, and some sour acetaldehyde notes. Some sweet bready malt and grassy hops come through as well, but this is overall much more dark and heavy feeling than I had anticipated. I'm picking up some molasses, figs, and some caramel malt. It's got a slightly herbal, or medicinal quality that turns me off a little, sort of reminds me of a barley wine in this regard. Butterscotch, brown sugar, and a distinct spicy character also come through.  T - Sort of strange, lots of sweet malt presence, kind of butterscotch like. Quite bready and yeasty through the middle, with lots of dark fruits complimenting this. Finishes with a dry, earthy hop feel with a pronounced spiciness. Lots of odd buttery-sweet malt flavors throughout. The dark fruits don't really work well with this malty sweetness, and the strange acetaldehyde funkiness really feels off. I get a touch of oak-like cherry flavor and herbal notes after it warms a bit, furthering the similarities between this and a barley wine. Overall this flavor profile feels a bit disjointed and peculiar to me; it's a decent tasting beer and undeniably complex, but far from other Belgian ales I've enjoyed.  M - Medium bodied feel, with nice smooth carbonation, just like I would expect a Trappist ale feel like, but at the same time the body feels a touch slick and oily. Kind of syrupy even.  D - Definitely feeling a little underwhelmed by Orval. While I'm a big fan of Belgian ales, this one wasn't really my cup of tea - or beer I suppose. It was certainly worth trying once, and maybe I'll even revisit it again with a re-review down the road, but until then Orval will sit comfortably behind the likes of finer Belgian ales out there for me.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,shigg85,4.62,"Bought a bottle of this from Tanakaya in Mejiro, Tokyo. Poured it into a Trappistes Rochefort goblet. Amazing thick head that settles and remains for the life of the brew in a fried egg pattern with a thick yolk in the middle of the glass that thins out from there. The smell is the first thing that embraces me as I pour it. Amazingly strong and pleasant! The taste is equally wonderful: a strong barley base with fruity notes of apple and spice. The mouthfeel was a little thin, but still pleasant in how it foamed back up in the mouth a bit. Overall, another great Belgian trappist brew to add to the list.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Philousa,3.55,"Pours a cloudy dark tan with a thick three finger head. Takes a while to settle down, but it's not out of control. Belgian yeast is the showcase for the nose. Banana, allspice, some beligan pale malt aroma and some sweet caramel. Lighter than I was expecting. The taste is thoroughly bitter with a light body. Most spices come through well in taste, allspice and pepper mostly, but it's mild. Tart lemon zest lingers with the bitterness. Medium moutfheel, well balanced. Dry finish.  This was very mild. I can tell that there are complexities in here, but it's hard to coax out of the glass. I get more malt aroma with a good swirl, which showcases the grains well, but the yeast really doesn't stand out as much as I think it should. I feel pretentious saying how this beer should be brewed, one that has been brewed for hundreds of years, but hey, it's how I feel. I'm thinking this was built up too much for me and I wanted more complexity. It's a great Belgian Pale, but nothing spectacular.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

This beer exhibited excellent head retention properties and significant lacing is observed.  S: Aromas of green apples, lemon zest, barnyard funk, and spices/pepper. Quite complex and enticing.  T: Flavors of green apple with some brown sugar sweetness, followed by lemon zest and spices/pepper, and finish with a pleasant bitterness. A little of the funk is present as well and the flavors are complex.  M: Medium bodied with moderation to high amounts of carbonation. Mild acidity is present and the beer is crisp.  O: Great beer - a very well done Trappist beer. I'm really glad this is available at the local bottleshop because I have and will continue to enjoy this beer.

This one has some carb.Good retention and heavy lacing throughout. Body is copper colored and fairly clear.  S: White pepper and clove. Bready yeast. Earthy barnyard funk and hay. Lemon citrus. Some floral notes that add a touch of sweetness to the aroma.  T: Like the nose but with much greater intensity. Heavy pepper and clove. Caramel pays a short visit. Waves of tart funk and breadiness...more like cracker than bread I suppose. The floral qualities come through mid-palate. Finishes bone dry with some fusel alcohol aftertaste.  M: Medium body, heavy carb. It’s mostly dry with some prickliness on the tongue. It warms you a bit.  O: Although this isn’t my favorite style, it is very easy to appreciate. Very complex and balanced despite the intensity of its flavors. The measuring stick for Belgian pales.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,travMI13,4.63,"What better way to break in an Orval goblet than with the beer itself? Also, this may be the freshest I have ever had this beer, and that was by design. 2011 vintage. Bottled on 10/2/2011. 12 oz. bottle poured into an Orval goblet.  A: Deep, golden orange with a finger of fluffy, white head. Excellent head retention with tons of lacing.  S: A mild fruity aroma with hints of hops and yeast. The smell is pretty mellow, but it is very inviting.  T: The subtle hint of sweet fruits like some sort of wild berries hits first, transitioning to caramel malts and caramelized sugar. I get slight yeasty funk next, followed up by a nice bitterness from the hops, finishing out with the sweetness that was there from the start. Whoa. It really has been a while since I've had this, and I must have missed it. This is incredibly complex.  M: Great carbonation, mild acidity, and near perfect balance. The flavor lingering on the mouth constantly changes and lures me back in for more. Wow.  O: Doing a formal review only confirms why this is a classic. It also reaffirms why one could argue that this is the class of the Trappist ales, and why it remains one of the best beers in the world. I can't believe I went a year or two without having it. This should be in both my refrigerator and cellar at all times.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Neorebel,4.88,"As I pour this sacred liquid into my goblet, Orval appears as a beautiful shade of clear copper, topped with a very puffy 1"" white head. The aroma is rich and complex... I'm picking up spices, a yeasty 'farmhouse' funk, sugary malts, and various fruits- including green/sour apple, lemon and banana. What's unique about experiencing this beer is that the initial flavor and feel is crisp and peppery, with a subtle hint of hops, and the finish is a nice 'banana bread' aftertaste. Two quite different flavor effects merging together to form a tasty union. Absolutely delicious and drinkable anytime, and one of my favorite beers of all time.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

S - Green apple, barnyard funk, lemon zest, slight dry hop smell as well. Great smelling beer.  T - Follows the nose almost exactly with slightly tart green apple and just a hint of citrus up front followed by a touch of Bretty funk. Nice slight bitterness on the back end.  M - Medium body and ample carbonation leaves an amazing dryness.  O - Wow. I didn't expect to like this beer THIS much.

S: Banana spiciness that gracefully kisses the nose  T: Taste is way better then the previous bottles ive cracked. A forward flavor is all brett with simple and tame esters that bite at the taste buds. Slight spices mixed with orange peel are quite prominent.  M: Fuller and thicker then the last bottle that i had which ended up watery and dull/muddled in flavor. Sharp and dry  O: A great tasting beer that offers great subtle complexities of the trappist style. Not my favorite but definitely a go to belgian.

A: Pours a hazy dark gold color with a creamy two-finger white head that leaves a bit of lacing. Looks appealing.  S: Tangerine-like citrus with Belgian yeast. A bit of alcohol in the background. Smells refreshing.  T: Tangerine peels up front carry all the way through to a bitter finish. There are some nice spicy yeast notes in the middle. The finish has some salty qualities that I'm not sure I like.  M: Medium-bodied with a dry finish. I would have liked a bit more carbonation here to go with the citric flavors.  D: This is very different from the other Trappist beers I've had to date. The hop character is interesting and it's easy to drink.

Some lacing flecks initially, but then sheets on the swirl.  S: There is a brightness to the smell.  Like lemon peel or orange zest.  I also detect some banana notes. Some bready biscuity malts are there.  Maybe some of that Brett is there buried.  T: Actually still have some hop presence on the tip of the tongue.  Fruity citrusy notes.  Then I get some of those biscuity malts.  There is some mild funkiness in the mid mouth but not like American Wilds.  I understand how this is a staple.  Very well balanced.  With a crisp dry close.  White wine like.  As it warms and I drink, I get more of that Brett character.  Delicious!  M: Medium bodied.  Great carbonation.  O: A beer for a reason.

The appearance is a darkish orange with lots of bubbles coming from the bottom of the chalice. I did not observe any ""floating"" yeast. The scent is all apple and some dark fruit. This beer literally explodes on the tongue with the taste following the scent of apple and dark fruit, a bit of hops and bitterness and sweetness simultaneously. The carbonation is pronounced.

Smell: Sweet and yeasty with phenols of clove, apricot and banana. Some slight floral hops underneath.  Taste: A great yeasty profile with the perfect amount of malts and hops to balance. Sweet and fruity, but just a hint of hops bitters and malt richness to balance it all out. A really fantastic tasting Belgian Pale Ale.  Mouth feel: Slick and creamy with just the right carbonation for the style.  Overall: An excellent Belgian Pale ale for sessions.

There is a respectable Brett flavor starting to kick in with this bottle. Bottled 11/17/2010, this has a year and a few months in a bottle. I am curious ton try a bottle that has been aging longer now to see how the Brett matures after a few years.  M: a medium body for the style, and for a 6% relatively thick.

It begins with classic Belgian yeast and fruit flavors, then peppery spices. Finishes very dry with some bitterness that lingers. A touch of alcohol comes through. I don't really perceive much brett funkiness.  M - Very dry. High carbonation level gives it a crisp feel, despite being fairly high alcohol.  O - A very good Belgian beer.

Smell - This is a ridiculously good smelling beer, so many aromas and scents ill try my hardest to even try to pinpoint them. I get sweet fruits right up front, like a light sour beer, some cherries and raspberries but its all wrapped up in a little lemon zest and barnyard funk with an amazing sense of belgian yeast. If i close my eyes its almost like i am smelling an incredibly complex quad.  Taste - WOW, so this is what all the talk is about. Seriously this is one of the best belgians I've ever tasted and I've had a lot. Okay, here we go..As it sits on the tongue i am greeted by a pungent sweetness, almost like a fig with some cheese, there are sweet fruits here like grapes with prunes in the background. I sense some nice lemon zest too like the nose and the belgian yeast lends to an incredibly nice funk to bring all these flavors into one quintessential belgian beer. Just unbelievably complex, dont even read my review, go buy one.  Mouthfeel - Nicely carbonated, swishes nicely over the tongue to allow all the flavors to yield.  Overall - Ive been an avid beer drinker for a few years now and always read about how good this beer was. For some reason i couldn't bring myself to pick one up for 7 bucks a bottle. I finally did and WOW, this is easily one of my favorite belgian beers I've ever had the chance to try, so complex with a ton of nuances.

37,129,SLeffler27,3.93,"This is a coppery opal beer with a thick creamy sherbet head and omnipresent effervescent carbonation churning like a storm within the Orval chalice. The head never goes away. Rather, it undulates with each sip. There is no true descriptive for the lacing which is more like patches of foam piled up on the walls of the glass.  There is a strong, fresh and fruity aroma with distinct yeast and white wine notes. Hop aromas are clearly present, but far from the forefront. Orchard fruit of apple, pear and peach mingle in the background with horse blanket aromas.  The flavors are all rather delicate. There is a hint of orange juice on toothpaste that holds it back. Overall, rather fruity and tart with a strong acidic tendency that lingers long into the finish. With warmth, this one develops to resemble a farmhouse ale.  Explosive carbonation keeps this one cleaning the palate with a light to medium body. Alcohol is present and well controlled; however, there are slight metallic twinges in the dry finish.  Orval Trappist Ale is a very nice, occasional beer. In my opinion, other trappists have more to offer, but none are as refreshing as this.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

The color was a deep clover honey and hazy producing a moderate dense foamy pillowy head khaki in color. After a while it settles down to a persistent thin blanket sticking to the sides of the glass. Very attractive.  fragrances were sweet, toffee, yeast, hint of pine forest.  The flavors diverged from what the nose may lead you to expect. There was a strong piney hoppy bite that hit you up front and stayed throughout the finish. There was the citrus rind and some other herbaceous haylike flavors rolling around.  Great complexity drawing you in for most sips. Carbonation was just right - enough to cleanse the palate and release the flavors but not too much to distract.

37,129,Keffa,4.03,"Bottled on date of 10/2/11.  Live Review.  Bottle poured into my Duvel tulip.  A: Pours a slightly hazy orange-ish amber color, 2 finger off white head settles to a full cap after a couple minutes, lacing is pretty standard for a Belgian, copious and lasting. Not what I was expecting for a ""Belgian pale ale"" but still a good looking beer.  S: Odd, yet good. Sweet bread, some light yeasty phenols, and pepper. Not what I expected from the words others have wrote for this beer.  T: Even less like what I expected. Very, very slight tart note is taken over almost immediately by a sweet malt backbone along with a slight fruitiness. Pepper is again a strong component, as is a bit of powdery yeast. Funk is very restrained, almost to the point of me questioning if this beer has Brett in it, until the dry finish reminds me that it is indeed in here. Some alcohol is noticeable in flashes here and there, but it's not something that detracts from the beer any.  M: Medium bodied, prickly carbonation, slightly coating on the palate. Decent.  O: Good. Not exactly what I was expecting from the talk that I've seen and heard about it. Not nearly the Brett bomb that it's been described as. Good beer, a classic, but not sure that I'd drink another one fresh, I may buy another and sit it in the fridge for a couple years and see how it progresses.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Retention is remarkable (as in 5 - 10 minutes, and it hasn't moved).  S - Incredibly complex. Sweet pale malt, awesome yeast, citrus, banana, floral notes, sour funk, and spice all come to mind. I'm even more excited to taste it.  T - Citrus and sweet fruit over a lovely subdued caramel pale malt foundation. The yeast begin to take over midway, with bready and funky sour notes. Floral hops notes throughout. Wonderfully complex and balanced. Masterfully built.  M - Medium bodied, smooth, and perfectly dry on the finish. Tailored exactly to the flavors.

37,129,quirkzoo,3.67,"Bottled 29/4/09  Pours a nice rich mahogany with a ton of off white head that sticks all over the glass. Nose is slightly tart up front, with some fresh green apple followed with a funky woodsiness (I imagine a mushroom growing on a slightly rotted out log). I get just a little bit of a flowery soft scent, like lavender. The taste was good but I marked it lower than the nose because I am getting a harsh/flat bitterness like aspirin left to dissolve in the mouth. The mouthfeel was also very, very thin, combined with the very active and prickly carbonation, this felt more like a soda which really detracted from the taste. As I let it warm up the mouthfeel is improving and I am able to taste more balance but it is still not quite there for me. This one might just have a bit too much age on it (~3 years) and the brett has thrown it out of balance, I would like to try a fresher bottle to compare",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

There is a mild flowery taste along with very light banana and clove. The drink is rounded off with a dry, yeast like taste.  The light side of medium on the body with good, strong carbonation and smooth, dry finish.  A great beer that was not at all like what I had been expecting, the floral notes alone where a big surprise but a pleasant one.  1001 Beers To Try Before You Die: http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,HopDr,4.92,"Bottle poured into a chalice.  A- Cloudy burnt amber color. Really nice lumpy head which just settles in and stays forever.  S- This is what Belgian Pales are all about. Subtle and wonderful. Fruit flavors, mostly green apple with a touch of citrus and just the smallest amount of Belgian musty funk.  T- This is where it really sets itself apart. I get the flavors described in the aroma at first, but there are more layers. There is a hint of sweetness and then sourness which really makes the aroma pop. These flavors and aromas dissipate and fade into a spicy, fairly intense bitterness (maybe form the alcohol? probably not hops) which lasts until the next sip.  M- Really nice. Not too heavy not too light, not too much carbonation, just right.  O- I have to admit that there are a lot of Belgian strong ales which I don't 'get'. Duvel tastes like overcarbonated Heineken to me. I don't see the magic in Chimay Red. But this one is different, it really balances all of what makes Belgian pales what they are, the complexity and unique flavors imparted largely by the yeast and fermentation, while remaining accessible and very drinkable (it just tastes good!).",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,bigaltemple,4.73,"11.2oz. Bottled on 5/20/2011  A - Hazy, burnt orange. Big, rocky head quickly and continuously builds even with gentle pour. Slowly settles to a 1/2 finger width that remains thanks to a steady stream of bubbles. Leaves some sticky rings of lacing.  S - Citrus acidity. A bit of Belgian yeast provides just the mildest amount of funk. Pick up some green apple as well.  T/M - Awesome! Lemon and orange zest. More green apple in the taste. Finishes with a spicy/peppery dry finish that just makes me want to take another drink. Great level of carbonation.  O - Easily a top example of the style. Always amazing, and worth trying.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,jjkatter,4.38,"33cl bottle poured into a Trappistes Rochefort chalice …  A- Dark amber, cloudy color. White head with high effervescence. Nice pillowy lacing that stays with the beer to the end.  S- subtle in the aroma department. Faint citrus with  T- dry twang that sets this beer apart from any other I have tasted. A truly unique flavor. A bit of a unsweetened tea with lemon taste up front, quickly replaced with an extremely dry with pleasant spice finish. First taste presents itself sort of simplistic, but as you delve into the beer, its elegant complexity becomes more and more apparent.  MF- refreshing and moderate ABV which does not present itself. Plenty of carbonation  O- This beer is like no other out there that I have come across. It’s definitely one of those beers that a certain percentage of people will not appreciate. It may even be said to have an acquired taste. While I find this beer a bit pricey, I do enjoy revisiting it from time to time.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,rangerred,4.53,11.2oz bottle poured into a goblet.  Appearance is a hazy dark orange with a 2 finger thick white head. Retention is awesome. The head simply refuses to fade away!  Smell is very orangy and yeasty with also a bit of juniper.  Taste is citrusy up front with apple and orange. Orange being predominant. There is also a woody note along with a slight tartness from the yeast. Bitterness is present throughout but really becomes noticeable toward the finish. The beer finishes with a long lasting dryness.  Overall this is a unique beer. Maybe not the the best Belgian out there but it is different from other ones and a beer that everyone should try.,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,BigCheese,4.36,"11.2 oz bottle, bottlen on 8/1 drank on NYE 2011  A: Orange Cloudy, similiar to a hef but darker, lots of rising bubbles forming a huge white cloudy head. Left a wall of lacing. Impressive.  S:That distinct sweet belgian yeast smell, hard candy, some nutmeg maybe?, hints of orange rinds  T: Very complex, a lot going on, sugary pixie stick sweetness, some cloves/spice as well, a kiss of hops gives it a dry champagne like finish.  M: Really carbonated, has a crisp clean dryness to it that I liked, alcohol is not overly pronounced at all. Drinkable but a tad to sweet for me to have more than 1.  O: Really enjoyed this brew, although I have certainly enjoyed other beers more but I would say everyone should try this atleast once.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Heavenisbeer,3.64,"Bottled on 1/6/10.  A: Gorgeous look to this one. Dark amber body, with a two-finger cloud white head with great retention and enough lacing to make you wanna take a spoon to the sides of the glass to get your money's worth. Hazy, as the yeast is still hanging around.  S: The yeast is front and center. Smells like a combination between a sour and a saison, with barnyard funk and harsh tartness paving the way for some light fruits and oak-y blasts. This doesn't smell like other Trappist ales I've had--it's much more sour in the nose (I'm hoping the bottle isn't infected).  T: I absolutely love sours, but I didn't expect this to be this sour, and although it's not actually offputting, I'm hoping that there's nothing wrong with the beer. That said, this one is funky and tart from the get go. There are hints throughout of some light fruits (apple peel, pear, lemons) and some oak-y notes on the backend, but this is mostly sour.  M: Tart, bubbly, and extremely dry.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Bouleboubier,4.12,"Bottled: May 2011 Opened/notes from: Nov 2011  Orval has a pretty yet rustic appearance. Misty-hazy and pink-amber in color. Half liquid / half foam on pour - a pearly, sticky, cotton candy-like foam that collapses somewhat fast but with abundant replenishment throughout.  A complex potpourri of aromas: hoppy, first off - spicy/floral, very (arguably) resiny. A little bit of caramel (malt) poking through, but just a kiss. Only tiny hints of funk (early) - ultimately smells most similar to a (fruited) lambic as far as its brett influence goes. Lastly, something like strawberry(?) extract? A vibrant overall smell, with some depth.  On my palate, a warm saison-like spice is the first sensation, not to mention some musty, slightly twangy, and haystack nuances. The hops lend some firm bitterness, for sure, but the alcohol (and, to a lesser extent, malt flavors) helps keep balance. Malt is there, perhaps lending to the golden raisin and subtle sweetness I'm tasting, however, it seems muted by the brett and hops. The hops really round things out nicely - something I hadn't given much attention to in the past.  My first impression of its body is: ""compact""- not thin, not syrupy, like an extract/syrup thinned with liqueur. A wee bit warming.  Orval reveals something different every time I've had it - every experience enjoyable.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Jef59,4.62,"Pours a gorgeous hazy orange with a gigantic off-white head.  The smell is amazing! Vey similar smelling to a white wine. Grapes, oranges, and a little grapefruit. There is a little pine and nuttiness followed by sweet sugary smell. A little boozey but in a nice way.  Tastes of sweet malts with an extremely crisp and refreshing hop note. Very citrusy and grapey like the nose. It's kinda funky, not in a horse blanket kind of way but it has a slight twang to it. Extremely well balanced. Extremely refreshing.  Nicely carbonated. Not very thick and is easily quaffable (I wouldn't dare though)  A truly unique Belgian ale. Very distinct and delicious.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,VncentLIFE,2.31,"First time in a bar. Stupid, I know.  Pours a hazy dull orange, Decent white head with what looks like cultures of bacteria or fungi floating on top of it.  Smells strongly of yeast. Slight hints of brett.  Taste is basically yeast. I cant get over the yeast. It fills my mouth entirely, leaving no room for any other flavors. Tone down the yeast, and this might be a great beer, but as is not so much.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,JAXSON,4.03,"1 year old bottle, Nov 2010 bottling. Pours a pinkinsh amber gold with a large head and a tempestuous body. Nose is soft peaches and apples, hay, brett. Mouth is sweet trappist yeast throughout with a bready quality and medium hops over the finish. Dries out a lot toward the back palate but still sweeter than I remembered this being. Fair amount of dry, earthy brett creeping out at this age. Not nearly as bright or hop forward as the recent Jul 2011 bottling. Apples, stewed peaches throughout that avoid being overly sweet.  To me, this succeeds at being many things at once, but I don't feel it's really exceptional on any level. I've enjoyed the 5 month and 13 month old bottles I've had recently (which were massively different), but there are certainly better trappist ales, better dry brett golden ales, better Belgian pale ales out there. This is pretty notable in its transcendence but it's not straightforward enough for me, I suppose.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,ummswimmin,4.45,"I got this beer at the local bar. They served it in a chalice provided by the brewer.  This beer pours straw yellow with a light, fluffy head. This head retains for a couple minutes.  The flavor is light and clean. It is a great example of a well made belgian beer. This is one of those great examples why everyone thinks so highly of belgian made beers.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Cru,4.85,"My favorite beer. The perfectly balanced flavor profile. Just enough sour to keep the malty sweetness common in the Trappist Style from taking over. Most of the other Trappist style beers tend to be far to malt-forward for my taste. But I love this beer, I might have married it if I had known about it before I met my wife.  High carbonation, often overflows on opening, head can take some time to dissipate. Straw to copper color.  Strong fruit nose, strong sour apple but clearly the intended flavor. Balanced bitterness. Very clean mouth feel. No lingering after taste.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Siriusfisherman,4.59,"Appearance: A cloudy gold with a slight amber tinge. A huge foamy eggshell white head sits atop and carbonation bubbles streak up the sides of the glass to the surface.  Smell: Crisp, unbelievably crisp. Wonderful blends of tart white fleshed fruits give this beer a spectacular blend of character and spice. Very champagne inspired aroma that is balanced out with a warm maltiness and bready yeast presence>  Taste: A huge hit of finely bubbled carbonation opens of the palate for a storm of complexity. White grapes and crisp tart apple flavors fill the mouth, creating a world of champagne effervescence. The sweetness is balanced out with some spice, light bitterness and a nice yeast breadiness, and brett funk. The brett funk varies in its prominence based on how old the bottle is. The fresh stuff will have a lot more hop flavor, the older stuff will have more barnyard/wet hay aroma and flavors. I personally prefer it under a year, around the 6 month mark I find superb balance.  Mouthfeel: The carbonation works wonders in this beer, not staying out of the way of the flavor but opening up your palate for the flavor to storm and be cherished. Breadiness gives the beer a medium/light body and light bitterness gives it a nice fresh exit.  Overall, a great Belgian Ale, there are few I have enjoyed more. It is my favorite of the Trappist Ales I have had, certainly the most unique. Perfect balance meets brettanomyces!",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,CowsCanBark,4.37,"Poured from 11.2 oz. bottle into pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a cloudy orange with a huge four-finger+ off-white head. Heavy lacing left along the glass.  Smell: It smells so good. Extremely sweet and fruity smelling, bananas, apricots, peaches, flowers. Delectable.  Taste: Unexpected, kind of medicinal taste at the front, what I expect to be the yeast. It sounds unpleasant, and may be to some, but I like it. Finish is like the smell, very fruity and flowery, slightly hoppy.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a dry finish.  Overall: Lives up to its reputation, a great ale with an amazing smell and good taste, highly recommended.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,TenHornsProud,4.7,"Pours an opaque dark orange with a huge, and I mean huge, white rocky head that lingers and laces. One of the best looking pours I've seen.  Smells of brett, apple, pear, sugar, bubble gum. Really great aroma, makes you want to take a sip.  Taste is up front hop and brett that fades into a fruity, sugar malt and hop character and ends with some yeast spice, hop bitterness, and fruit. Complex as all hell and refreshing.  Lighter to medium body with high carbonation work perfectly for the beer.  Hoppy (maybe a bit too astringent), fruity, spicy, sweet yet dry, just really interesting and complex. The brett is more subtle but present. What's not to love. Amazing beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

A- Poured a mostly clear semi--hazy dark golden color, amazing, huge, fluffy head that left some lace. Lots of small bubbles, highly carbonated  S- Big lemon, hay, banana, citrus, and funky notes  T- This is super bitter, lots of sulfur/salty qualities on the finish. You get some of the flavors in the aroma, but this salty sulfur quality overpowers this whole beer.  M- Highly carbonated, chalky dryness  O- Is this a bad bottle? Maybe. This was a huge and expensive disappointment. Tons of nondescript bitterness, if only the taste matched the aroma. I could not finish this.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Brewdacris,4.57,"I decided that I would review Orval tonight because I reviewed Delirium Nocturnum last night and wanted to finally determine which I enjoyed more. Delirium Nocturnum is my long time favorite but I tried an Orval for the first time a couple months ago and I remember thinking that it may rival the Nocturnum in overall enjoyment. So tonight I decided to find out for good.  Appearance- Beautiful burnt orange color with a rocky, off-white three finger head. Dissipates after a while leaving a heavy lacing along the glass. Settles into a solid quarter finger covering after a few minutes. Very good looking beer.  Smell- Tart apple and a floral/lemon/banana scent. Very wonderful smelling. Possibly my favorite aspect of this beer.  Taste- Very smooth and surprising flavor. Very tart, sour taste from the get go. Accompanying alcoholic burn, but an extremely pleasant and fitting one. The first taste is almost too overwhelming to separate any flavors, but on the subsequent samplings tart fruit flavors are extremely apparent. Banana and lemon make themselves known, as does a heavy hop bite on the tail end. Sour fruit is present as the dominant aftertaste. I sipped this over a half hour period and the flavors made themselves more apparent as it warmed.  Mouthfeel- Extremely crisp, smooth mouthfeel. If you let the Orval settle in your mouth the carbonation makes itself very apparent. Just ever so slightly too light. Almost perfect for the flavor but could use a little thickness.  Overall, this is indeed a fantastic beer. Although it has failed to overtake Nocturnum as my favorite beer, perhaps it is unfair to compare the two. The Orval is definitely my favorite Belgian Pale Ale but I'm a sucker for Belgian Strong Darks. Overall an excellent beer and one I would recommend to any fan of pale ales.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Glorious!  Aroma was funky brett, some floral notes and very faint citrus.  Taste was slightly hoppy, caramel, grass, citrus, and a touch of funk and yeast. Dry finish.

37,129,MarkBlackout,4.68,"Had this last night after a LONG time without having one. $5 at Stoney's liquor store in Indianapolis. Great beer, I really enjoyed it. Has a nice sourness and dry hop presence. Poured REALLY foamy, had to let it settle 2-3 times to get the tall drinking glass filled. This is a classic, no doubt about it. I love the simple presentation of the label, and (rarely for me) the lack of a totally in your face flavor. This has a nice subtlety. Its hard to beat when it comes to Belgians if you're looking for something on the dryer side. Thanks for reading. Drink one soon.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Smells faintly of an acetone-like sweetness. There's a funky yeasty smell that reminds me of home made cider. It stings the nostrils a little, like smelling a solvent and it tastes... strange. Very dry and only slightly bitter. There are earthy flavours that remind me of hay or straw, it doesn't taste very malty at all.  Until I got to the end of the bottle, I thought this beer was fairly average. Then I poured in the last of the beer along with the yeast sediment on the bottom.. A nice, complex blue-cheese like flavour came through taking this beer to another level.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,RWD1,4.6,"Appearance: Pours a dense amber into a tulip, capped with a massive rocky white head, which leaves huge lacing as it goes down.  Smell: Floral and some tart citrus are in front, but there’s also a hint of hops and a very, very subtle whiff of the barnyard.  Taste: Hops bite right from the beginning and stay with you to the end. Along the way, though, it’s a pretty varied ride. I get green apple tartness at first, which gives way to a mellow malt sweetness which, while it does not overtake the hops, balances them out somewhat. The funk from the Brettanomyces becomes slightly more prominent as the beer warms and adds yet another dimension. It finishes bone dry.  Mouthfeel: For me this beer defines crisp. Despite the complexity of the beer, it actually feels light-bodied at times, and medium-bodied at most. It reminds me of a line from a Tom Waits song: “she was sharp as a razor and soft as a prayer”  Drinkability: Extremely high, but take it slow. It’s extraordinary cold, but even better as it warms a bit.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,Phelps,3.85,"Bottled May 20, 2011, poured into a snifter.  Deep carrot orange, with a heavy cloudy sheen. My fingers are just shadows on the other side of the glass. The head — airy, craggy, sand-colored — gets about three fingers tall then descends to about one before setting up camp.  Smells spritzy. Red apples and pear mix with just a hint of toast and caramel. Brett lends a subtle acetic bite and a hint of barnyard funk. Complex stuff.  The flavor’s more muted, though hints of the nose’s brightness shine through. Green apple and a touch of pear juice are offset by sweet caramel and increased funk. There’s just a touch of tartness, and pretty heavy bitterness. As I make my way through the glass, the fruits become more prominent, balancing the pleasant tartness nicely. Finishes dry as a bone.  Massive, prickly carbonation in a medium-light body. Fizz emerges as the liquid moves across the tongue.  Well, hmm. I’ve waited a long time to try Orval, and I respect its pedigree, but I have to say I expected more.

Everlasting retention and some sticky lacing down the glass.  Smell - Floral, fruity, slightly yeasty. Hoppy as well, but not a ton. Really fresh and bright flavor. Not as funky as I would have expected, but it's there.  Taste - Not quite as bright as the aroma, but nice. Hops are significantly more dominant and they drown out the fruitiness. It's got a lot of bretty flavors to it, also. I like those, but miss the fruit brightness. Strong bitterness in the finish.  Mouthfeel - Extremely dry. I find that it accentuates the bitterness too much. Still, light and refreshing.  Overall - Very fascinating beer. I have two. One to age and one to drink now.

37,129,bebbcorp,4.88,"Served at cellar temp from bottle poured into wide mouth goblet. Upon opening the bottle it hisses a very healthy carbonation and smells of yeast, lemongrass and a very clean musty attic. A clean pour with no sediment shows just how very carbonated this beer is and results with a very large head that crackles and pops receding into a great bubbling lace. A minute after the pour I put my head close to the glass and the beer is still bubbling and talking to me. Aromas from the glass are pale malt and cream. Beer drinks very dry and creamy with a bit of a pucker at the end, but not in a sour way at all. Almost like hay, dirt, mushrooms, and a very very good bread of a type that I have never had before. I am not experienced with brettanomyces but I think that is what this is and is flourishing in this beer. The beer was bottled on 29/07/2009 and that would explain this. It is all very enjoyable and makes me ponder at the end of every sip and I very much like this beer. So very smooth with no noticable alcohol. I could chug this beer if I wanted to quite easily, but that is not what I want to do. Then it would be gone and I would be sad. This beer is forcing me to enjoy it and I am sipping it slower than any beer I've had in a while. The bretty flavor stays in your mouth long after last sip is gone and that makes this beer all the more valuable. A beer that keeps entertaining the tastebuds even after it's gone. Orval trappists you have created a truly great beer and it's no wonder you only make two different beers. No need to make any more when you nail one perfectly.

37,129,JerzDevl2000,4.23,"Finally got around to trying this last night. Even though this was bottled this past Spring, I wasn't worried about this being skunked. I knew that many people aged their beers and as soon as I took a whiff of this, I could tell that this was one of the few that aged well without being full of hops. Everything about this beer screamed classic and if this was available in bigger servings, I would buy some and share it with those who have yet to try it.  I loved the pour to this since I had never seen anything like it before - the hue was a light, cloudy olive to the point of being a faded amber and the head filled up the remainder of my pint glass. The aroma was complex to the point where not much stood out and the same went for the taste as well. Lots of sugar and booze to be sure but there were also notes of apricot and plum underneath. This was slightly bitter but what was there complemented the beer nicely, since it was a earthy and herbal type of hoppiness. This was full and didn't go down quickly even though it was enjoyable from start to finish.  This beer gave me the impression that was much stronger than it actually turned out to be. While the taste isn't for everyone, this has a classic appeal to it based on the cloudy hue and flavors that might not appeal to the hophead or extreme beer fanatic. The complex taste and slightly sticky mouthfeel lead to a slow session that's every bit enjoyable from start to finish. Any lover of beer owes it to him or herself to try and enjoy this!",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

S-Yeasty funk along with some pale fruits such as pears, lemons and apples. Floral too. Vibrant, bright nose. Waiting for the head to die down a bit so I can take my first sip.  T-The flavor slaps ass. Funky, fruity, sweet, and tangy. Belgian influence plays perfectly with the stranger flavors. Slightly sour. Yeasty Brett becomes more noticeable after a few sips.

M-Medium bodied with strong carbonation. Dry and crisp. The carbonation is nice. Overall, a good body that complements the flavor well.  O/D-This Trappist beer goes down super easy. Crisp, tart, and unique. I found it to be a pleasurable drink to say the least. Surprised I haven't had this before. Goddamn yummy.  ----- 3/8/16  The best Trappist beer by a mile according to my tongue. So unique. It has grown on me through the years and I haven't even consistently drank it. Now I think I'm going to buy a new one every year and cellar it. This is the epitome of a classic. In the Trappist family, Orval is the crazy cousin who rips butts and listens to metal. Awesome.  ----- 4/15/17  My favorite beer due to righteousness, availability, aesthetic, underratedness, and full blown badassery.

Pours a nice dark auburn color, with a bubbly, creamy off white head. Laces wonderfully.  Yeast aroma, with mild fruitiness and a good level of funkitude! Maybe a hint of spicy tinged hops.  Fruity, yeasty taste, some subtle funkiness, slight citrus and a funkier finish.  Crisp carbonation, that may or may not be appropriate of the style, but a little harsh to me.

Nothing stands out too much and I can tell there was a lot of effort put into balancing it out and they did a good job of that.

Its good and I think I may develop a taste Belgian styles sometime so until then, its just good and nothing better.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

First mouthfull was very sweet but the bitterness increased with every sip. Tasted of roasted malts, some charcol. This beer didn't taste like other belgian beers I've sampled, I thought it was more like an ESB. Overall, looked like a hefeweizen, tasted like an english strong ale and smelled unlike any beer i've ever had.

37,129,jhtipton,4.33,"Took me a while to find one in Spain but I am closing in on all the trappistes. Pours an orangish clout into my chalice with nice lacing and long lasting head of a light golden color. Smells somewhat cider like and not too overpowering. Taste is very good, some bitterness and tartness like a pear or apple cider and some phenol and medicinal qualities. Very quaffable. Body is medium with continuous carbonation but in a good way. I will definitely stock up next time I find this at Al Campo. Salud!",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Bottled on April 22, 2010  Pours a clear amber color with a beautiful off white head and tiny bubbles. Nice lacing as well.  Smells of a tinge of caramel sweetness, bread, some funk, spice, and herbs.  Taste opens with a bit of sweetness then moves into a funk and herbal taste. Finishes dry but lingering.  Mouthfeel is light and dry, just what I've been craving for some reason.  Overall, its really a good beer. I'm gonna age them more.

37,129,Duhast500,4.5,Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a stemmed tulip glass. (There were no chalice glasses at the place I was having this)  The color is a slightly hazy orange/amber with a finger of foamy head that disappeared a little quickly and left a small amount of lacing on the glass.  The smell is fruity in the nose with some nice slight Belgian yeast aroma that is giving it a bit of dusty-like feel to it.  The taste is a bit fruity with some yeasty flavor. There is a slight tartness to the flavor as it is also sweet with some malt flavor that has mellow bread flavor.  The feel of this beer is complex but smooth as it goes down. There is a multitude of different levels of flavor and feel.,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

While I love Orval with age on it I was interested to taste a young bottle. Poured into a Duvel tulip. Big, huge, rocky, merangue like head, lacing abounds. The color is that of a pale ale. This bottle presents fruit on the nose with some malt. Hops are more prominent then anything else. Really great malt/hop balance. Biscuit like malts pair with light tropical and citrus hops. I could use more phenols or esters one or the other I'm just not picking up too much Belgian yeast. As I stated I prefer this beer when the Brett shines through and I know what it can be. This fresh is still a tasty beer and a nice treat.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Robje,4.23,"This is my first review on BeerAdvocate, and hence my terminology might not quite be up to scratch, nor my ability to pick out any subtle flavours, so I will try to give a general impression of the properties of this beer. (I have tasted many styles of Belgian beers whilst living in the Netherlands, and will post some reviews as I find the inkling).  The beer was poured into a Westmalle chalice from the bottle, marked best before 22/06/2016 (Bottled 22/06/2011). Pouring was stopped just as I could see the cloudy yeast about to enter the cup (reviewers preference).  Appearance: 4.5 This beer poured nicely with an average head. The head lasted for a moderate amount of time, but not very long, the lacing was minimal as the beer was consumed. The beer poured very clear, with a medium amber colouring, with a golden tinge towards the edges. A very appetising appearance.  Smell: 4 The beer overall smelt quite good, with a slightly fruity smell, but quite overpowered by hops and carbonation to begin with. There were hints of some spices and the smell was enticing.  Taste: 4.5 Quite a strong presence of alcohol in the beginning for this style of beer. Fruity tastes with a mild yeast, and a slightly bitter after taste. There is a complexity to the taste that can be enjoyed from the first sip until the last. The bitterness tended to mellow towards the middle of the beer as the beer warmed, leaving a semi sweet tasting beer towards the end. I drank the remaining beer and yeast from the bottle about 3/4 of the way through the tasting, and they contained a pleasant flavour, that perhaps could offset the starting bitterness (Will try a second tasting with yeast in the glass).  Mouthfeel: 4 A smooth mouth feel, with a nice amount of carbonation that lasted until past midway through the tasting. The start of the beer provides a sharpness that is contrary to the smoothness that follows.  Overall: 4 This beer starts very nicely with complex tastes, and an enticing smell and ends with a smooth slightly fruity and semi sweet flavour that is easy on the mouth and sits nicely in the stomach. This is definitely a beer that can be enjoyed for a glass or three in the summer, autumn or spring, without overpowering the taste buds or cognitive functions.  Conclusion, a beer that is complex enough to enjoy the tasting, as well as smooth enough to follow with another in the evening. I would recommend this beer to anyone who wants to enjoy a fine example of a Belgian Pale Ale, and it ""feels"" a bit special, being one of the Trappist beers.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,sim0n17,4.35,"Love it!!! But who doesn't? Great Trappist ale with a sweet finish and a very round mouthfeel. That cloudy amber coloring is classic with a bit of a citrussy, sweeter aroma.

S: Light floral and citrus with some juniper berries. Very pleasant and inoffensive.  T: Very fresh tasting, floral notes take the cake here, but I notice some citrus hints here with a slight yeasty taste to it.

Slightly bitter up front with acidic notes. Tart and refreshing with citrus flavor. Grapefruit and orange flow through the profile. Light bready malt backbone dissolves in between the citrus and funky yeast. Finishes dry, tart, and sweet.  Medium body, ridiculously high carbonation, prickly and sticky on the tongue.

Poured into a Duvel Chalice. A very lively head, dense and compact, that slowly fades to rocky as it leaves a nice lacing behind. A lovely orange color with a minor haze.  Aroma is intoxicating. Funky citrus, oranges would probably be closest, with an almost woody/grassy undertone. It's not subtle.  The first sip is an unexpected slight smokey burnt caramel with grassy hop notes that fade into a refreshingly dry finish. Each sip the flavors settle more on the tongue. The beginning of the sip has a certain sweetness that fades into an assertive but not unpleasant bitterness.  Wait, where's the funk? It's there but it's subtle. It kind of shows up as an aftertaste. A little lingering hint of what would come with age.  Do I wish I had waited for this to age a little? No, I like to be able to taste what the base of this beer is before the bugs have there way with it. Do I wish I had a 2 year old bottle to follow this one up with?

37,129,Rschis16,4.55,"Bottled date is 11-17-2010, so almost a year of age to it. Poured into a snifter.  Hazy burnt amber hue, with some visible carbonation from the bottom. Thick three finger head on top that dissapates slowly and consistently, settling down to about a finger. Silky white in color, nice lacing. Big aromatic nose of white wine, citrusy hops and a hint of booze. Clean malts round it out, but the wine-like smell is the most notable. I expected more of a little Belgian yeast funk, but there isn't much of that. Clean and crisp nose all around.  Where I was reminded of white wine in the smell, the taste yields more of a citrusy sweetness or even a slight tanginess. It is remeniscent of a fresh lemon rind: bitter, but with a dry sweetness as well. It has the same characteristic white wine dryness to it all the way through the taste. Whereas this usually means crisp as well, it doesn't really get crisp until the finish. It has a great full body that forces the citrusy notes into every aspect of the palate. Grapefruit comes to mind. A very balanced consistency to the hops and wine-like characteristics. A nice citrusy bitterness hits and then lingers in the back of the palate, showing off the full effect of those hops. Alcohol taste is barely present, making the drinkability through the roof. A sour little tartness is evident in the linger, giving a slight puckering effect that begs for another sip. A soft carbonation contributes a smooth and easy-going mouthfeel. Combined with the dryness, it is very refreshing.  Great beer, I can see why so many people like it so much.

A tad sour but only faintly so.  Texture is rich and layered without being heavy or overly alcoholic. Fine balance of astringency with the sweetness, though light on both. Really well delineated.

Appearance: Pours a hazy orange caramel color with a huge 4 finger thick and creamy off-white head. A touch of sediment pools right on top of the billowy head. The head was so big it rose a full 2 fingers above the rim of the goblet. Perfect head retention. Halfway through the glass and it's still got a 1/2 finger head. Excellent lacing.  Smell: Strong funky notes with some sweet apple and pear coming through as well.  Taste: Crisp tart fruitiness up front followed by funky ""horseblanket"" notes in the middle before ending with a grassy hop bitterness at the finish. Aftertaste is funky, mildly phenolic and very dry. The dryness of the aftertaste lingers for long time.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a good amount of carbonation. The mouth puckers much the same as it does when eating an unripe persimmon.  Drinkability: High drinkability. Goes down smooth. While I wouldn't want multiples, drinking one is a pleasure.

37,129,doktorhops,4.57,"This one has been on my 'to do' list since I first started reviewing beers. There's something about Orval that intrigues me; from the shape of the tear-drop bottle to the heavy chalice you drink it from, there's something ethereal about this brew. I imagine Trappist monks in black & white cassocks standing around a large clay urn in the catacombs of a monastery testing the divine brew with their index fingers and kneeling down to praise God's glory that ale exists for human enjoyment... or something along those lines.  Poured from a 330ml bottle into a chalice glass.  A: This ale pours with great excitement. A deep clear amber body with a tinge of red and a Belgian beer classic ""soap bubble"" foamy white head that recedes after a moment to leave that sticky (alcohol laden) lacing.  S: The aroma is more reminiscent of spiced mead than beer, with bold notes of: Juniper, Sloe, Cloves, Honey, Orange peel and yeast - they're all here to party down. The smell of this alone could make a decent cologne!  T: Completely not what I was expecting. It's not sweet at all. The main profile is a Juniper/Sloe berry bitterness, however it also has a similar complexity to Duvel in that the flavour hits every part on the tongue in it's own way. There's sour-dough yeasts after the initial bitterness with a long dry citrus finish. In fact the only area where I find it lacking is the sweetness, which is unusual for a Belgian ale, and this was no doubt intentional.  M: A bit fizzier than the other Belgian ales I've had; medium carbonation with a medium body.  D: I can see why others may not rate this highly, it's definitely an acquired taste beer. If you like something fairly bitter and dry with spice flavours: then this is your beer. If you're looking for something outside the box: this is your beer. If you want a beer that is a divine experience: get Duvel. Orval is great for the fact that it's an unexpected drop but Duvel still stands tall in my taste buds... for now at least.  Food match: It is a challenging beer to food match. The boldness of the bitter/dry profile makes it a perfect match with bold cheeses (much like a red wine). Also venison and game meats would work well.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,kjyost,4.87,"Walked into the Liquor Mart today, and what the heck? Orval? Gotta pick that up...  Bottled on 04/01/2010 ABV 6,2%  Poured stiffly into a Leffe chalice that is not nearly large enough, with 2/3 head and 1/3 beer. The beer itself is golden to orangey. The head quickly descends to a small cap leaving lacing all the way.  What a fantastic aroma coming off he head though. Initially a tiny bit of funk came through, but it took we a moment to notice the oriental lily that was very strong. As that aroma weakened the essence of barnyard was coming out, perhaps with a hint of my wet dog, but that could just be me being crazy.  The beer itself is incredibly interesting with a light sourness and funk. When the remnants of the bottle are thrown into the chalice that lily flavour plays across the palate. No substantial bitterness. Different flavours are prevalent in each sip. Sometimes the malt plays through, other times different aspects of the funk, often it is floral esters.  The mouthfeel is a little weak initially, likely due to the stiff pour as the carbonation is almost flat. It gets better when the rest of the beer is poured in, becoming smooth and creamy with a light finish.  Drinkability? Hell yeah. This is lightest drinking trappist I have tried. I suspect though by the third it would quit being so complex, but still just flavour country...  EDIT: 09/24/11 Bottle aged 1.5 years. Strong lily notes have disappeared, much stronger barnyard aroma play through with a stronger finish on the palate. Not remaining hop aromas / flavours are apparent. Not as good as fresh.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,RandyV,3.53,"Cloudy amber color with nice head and lacing. The smell is to me somewhat champagne like with a mild yeast note.  The taste is slightly fruity, maybe apple or pear, with a musty quality. Mouthfeel was a bit thin. It finishes dry with a hop bitterness that lingers.  Gotta be honest, this beer underwhelmed me and was not worth the elevated price.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,EA728,3.83,"A: hazy orange/amber with a very nice head that remains.  S: smell is quite bland in my opinion, mostly malty  T: a pleasant malty flavor with the touch of belgium yeast, nice bitterness that I'm not used to in Trappist beers  M: very nice mouthfeel, goes down easy and feels refreshing  O: not my favorite Trappist beer, although it's almost its own style. very refreshing, not too heavy, but it lacks a bold flavor. nice availability in my area, so I will probably pick it up again.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

S: Malty, touch of floral hints  T: Complex bitterness with obvious yeast and some pear and cherry after tones.  M: medium carbonation; full bodied beer.

Taste... well, odd. Lots of bitterness, not all expected. Taste is actually a little bland beyond that- not a lot to it. Kind of disappointed. MF is creamy.  Man, the nose really had me going, but the taste didn't follow through. Bummed :(",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,t8s8l8,4.77,"Look- a darkish amber orange, reminds me of pretzels. a huge head the thing looks like fresh snow. big bubbles incase the glass as the head starts to fall leaving the lacing in its course.  Aroma- perfume aroma that jumps out of the glass even as i poured it. A sweet maltyness plays nicely in this complex bouquet, but still this floral perfume like cleanliness inoculates the senses, like trail running in the spring. woodsy and spicy and sweet all combined. second pour was slightly more fruity a low fruit (pear with some orange) presence played into the already complex aroma.  Taste- a smooth malt character hangs with this fruit front beer that the yeast has put into play so well. the fruitiness is reminiscent of the aroma. slight hop bitterness, and a great dryness finishes this brew out.  Overall Experience- This is an awesome beer and I will be bringing it to all social gathering. I'm sorry but if this doesn't make you want to drop that commercial beer and make the switch I don't know what will.

I get the sour peaches mostly. Tastes pretty good.  M: Highly carbonated with a medium body and a tad dry on the finish.

The smell is a sweet, juicy, cherry bubblegum aroma along with a yeastiness.  The taste is spicy and fruity (lemon) with plenty of the Belgian yeast and is a bit phenolic. There's nothing overpowering from any of the flavors and, in fact, they seem somewhat delicate and complex.  Mouthfeel is medium and on the dry side. The flavors seem to linger on the tongue and the back of my mouth. Carbonation is more than adequate and seems just right.  Overall: Yeah, this beer does deserve it's high grades.

37,129,draheim,4.41,"330mL bottle (bottled 5/19/10, best by 5/19/15) poured into a tulip. Gorgeous golden amber color with an enormous fluffy white head that fills the glass. Wonderful effervescent carbonation erupts from the bottom of the glass. Head just won't quit, looks like a mountain of delicious whipped cream. This is what a beer should look like. As the head ever so slowly breaks down, it leaves behind not lace but lovely cobwebs around the sides of my glass.  Aroma is tart and funky - green apples and Belgian yeast.  Taste is crisp, dry, refreshing. Pale malt, Belgian yeast and some hops to pull everything together for a nice clean finish.  Overall this is hands down one of my favorite year-round, always-available beers. Why don't I have a case of this at the ready at all times?",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,MoreThanWine,4.17,"Poured a 4"" off-white head. Hazy raw sienna yellow color. Smells of dried fruits and a little funk. Taste has the fruits, a little caramel, malt, and an aspect I had a hard time describing and I'm going to settle on almost a cola type flavor and sensation. Add a pretty long finish to it and you've got one classic beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,OutFox,4.5,"Bottled on 3/10/11. Ive had bottles with a couple years age on them as well, though not recently. This is quite fresh.  A- Poured into a Orval goblet. Pale amber/copper in color with a pure white head of over a finger. Great lacing and retention as is to be expected from Orval.  S- Sweet and spicey at the start, developing into classic Abbey style yeast aromas. Girlfriend said she smells a bubblegum hint. I didnt get it but its definately the Belgian Yeast strain.  T- Fantastic first of all (it is Orval). Candied Sugar notes at the begining evolving into a citrus and I almost got a little alcohol flavour on the way down even though its only 6.9%. Long lasting on the palate. Stays on the tongue and back of the throat for while which is truly pleasant.  M- Medium bodied. Just seems to last forever even after no longer in the mouth. Great stuff.  O- Some of the best beer period. Orval is amazing. Almost a sweet golden pale its just in a league of its own and will be forever in my mind.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,omnigrits,4.8,"Poured from the bottle into a globe.  A. A pale copper colour, slightly hazy, and with a vigorous off-white head. Masses of sticky lace.  S. Quite sweet and sugary at first, but then the other notes start coming in - floral, earthy, spicy yeast, a slight hint of mustiness.  T. This is not like any of the other Trappist beers I've tasted. The classic spicy Belgian yeast character is relatively muted, although it's there, and I'm getting a prominent lemon flavour along with some sourness (but not a funky kind of sour), and other flavours I can't even begin to pin down. A very complex ale.  M. Fairly light, highly carbonated, refreshing and dry.  O. That's a quality beer, and no mistake. It's far too easy to keep going back to the glass for another sip, but at least it's not up there in the ABV.

37,129,CwrwAmByth,4.8,"Poured from a 330ml bottle into a Chimay goblet.  Pours a hazy orange colour, great head and awesome lacing.  Smells of light spices, and citrus - very light and refreshing.  Taste is immense, so complex almost indescribable - well balanced citrus, crisp and refreshing light hops, medicine undertones similar to de Dolle's Stille Nacht.  An excellent beer - great at 7 months - must try again soon.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Clydesdale,4.38,"A: Pours a somewhat hazy amber/burnt orange. The tall, foamy and fluffy head has an amber tint. Retention is quite sturdy, and a substantial speckling of lacing sticks to the glass as the head gradually recedes.  S: Lightly sweet in the nose. Rather tart notes are prominent. A bit dusty and yeasty. Fruity. Notes of pear and apple, with a bit of vinous aroma as well. Some citric hop (?) notes are also detectable. Light phenols.  T: Some light sweetness up front. Distinctively yeasty. Equally tart, phenolic, and spicy. Fruity notes of pears and/or apples are moderate. Lightly funky. Hop bitterness is not especially assertive, but it is more noticeably present than I was expecting. Hop flavors recall candied citrus peel.  M: Medium-firm body. Carbonation is smooth and supple. Quite smooth and refined overall, before a modest finishing prickliness.  D: Quite enjoyable and complex, but in a relatively accessible fashion. This is a unique beer. I'm a bit embarrassed that I've never tried this (or many other Belgian standards) before.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

T: Pleasant taste of floral hops and spices which transitions into a faint taste of alcohol which then disappears. The taste is quite nice and disappears so fast that it made me go back quickly for a second sip.  M: Medium to thin viscosity with a medium level of fine carbonation.  O: An extremely easy drinker. It would be tough to sip this beer because it almost beckons you to go back to it quickly for another sip.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Crittervision,3.1,"A bottle of 2005 and a bottle of 2010 side by side. Consumed at Kulminator on 12 August 2011.  The 2005 is a brighter copper, with the most beautiful, nearly unbroken sheet of off-white lacing on the other side of the glass. Gorgeous. On the 2010, no lacing, bigger bubbles, thinner cap. A 5 for the 2005.  The smell is quite muted on the 2005, with only a slight lemon acidity. The 2010 is perceptibly fresher with at least a weak hop presence.  On the tongue, the 2005 has a subtle, nondescript, and gentle sourness. The 2010 has a nice, tangy, hoppy bitterness. Very simple. Very boring.  The 2010 has a prickle that has faded from the 2005. Both are soft and are gently carbonated.  Fresh is unsurprising. And five years apparently isn't enough for the yeasts to do any thing remarkable. Other glasses of Orval over the past month have been equally unexciting. Not nearly as charming as I thought it was a few years ago.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Smells of spices, cloves, fruit cup and distant bananas, followed by malt and wood and resinous hop. Flavors are wide –ranging from, fruit cup, spices, citrusy hops, and sweet malt. A little candi sugar rolls in as it warms, as does some alcoholic fuminess. An effervescent fizziness fades from the first pour and becomes very velvety and rounded.

Smell is pepper and clove, sweet fruits.  Taste is like no beer I've ever had...spices, unidentifiable fruits and flowers, yeasty tang at the finish and as the beer warms. Almost no identifiable alcohol.  Mouthfeel very fizzy, pleasing and refreshing, light body.

T: Starts out rather tart but then does this dry hoppy, phenolic thing. The finish is rather long and dry. You definitely could sit and ponder the finish for quite a while.  M: Medium to lite mouth feel. Very tightly carbonated. Dry.  O: A really nice well balanced beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Smells where very evident of citrusy fruits with a definite hop character and a bit of malty sweetness to balance out perfectly.  Taste was just as rated, ""Exceptional"". The same citrusy flavors evident in the nose were present in taste as well as a complex malt and hop character. Carbonation was very nice, bubbly to keep it light, but not harsh and overpowering. Aftertaste had a very nice bitterness from the hops with a nice dry finish.  Mouthfeel was excellent. Carbonation gave a very light feel as it coats the inside of your mouth, the hops are very evident giving a nice bitterness and a very dry ending. Very nicely done.

37,129,jtingue,4.88,"Poured into a Rochefort chalice.  Appearance. Pours with the most beautiful, well formed head I have personally ever seen. It is so rigid that it rises a good inch above the glass, without spilling. The beer itself has a hazy orange amber color.  Smell. Full of ripe fruits, with berries, mango, pineapple, and other tropical fruits. The now familiar smell of brettanomyces is also present, as well as the sourness that comes with it. The smell has an almost creamy richness to it as well.  Taste. A dry, but sweet, malt profile is initially there, but is immediately overtaken by a moderate level of bitterness. This bitterness fades into herbal, slightly earthy hop notes. Semi-sweet fruits are encountered next, with citrus and some of the tropical fruits described before. A very quick burst of intense sweetness follows which is more sugary than fruit based. The finish is very champagne like: dry and very fruity, but also bitter.  Mouthfeel. A moderate body is masked by an intense amount of carbonation.  Truly a unique beer. A must have for any beer enthusiast, or any human being with taste buds.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,woodychandler,4.67,"This review is for Joe Lipa and Craig Hartinger, my two main men at Merchant du Vin. Cheers and thanks for everything (except this beer - that I bought in DC)! I had gotten Joe to send me an apron which I wore pretty religiously (no pun intended for once) until I met the brother who oversees the brewing operation while he was in BOS for a BA BBF and he signed the apron for me using a Sharpie. The apron is now retired, but the memory lives on.  Orval translates from the French to Valley of Gold and the abbey was the gift of a princess who dropped her gold engagement (?)/wedding (?) ring into a nearby river. She prayed fervently for its return and when a fish surfaced with her ring in its mouth (look closely at their logo), she decided to pay homage by building an abbey for the local monks.  This is a beer that must be decanted super slowly not just to avoid stirring up the lees in the bottom of the bottle, but also because it has an inherent tendency to foam. Sure enough, over half of the glass was initially filled with dense, rocky eggshell-white foam. That was okay by me because it also allowed the funk of the strain of brettanomyces yeast that they use to fill the room. Color was a deep coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity thanks to my oh-so-gentle pour. Nose had the Brett funk going, but not in an obtrusive way. I have long characterized Orval as Brett for Beginners, a way to introduce the heretofore uninitiated to the wonders of Brett without causing them to turn away and never want to try any such beer again. I think of Jolly Pumpkin beers in the same way. Mouthfeel was quite full, perhaps due to the large CO2 bubbles inherent in the beer, and with a bitter, funky flavor that is unique to this beer. I cannot adequately describe it, but do know that when I say ""bitter"", I do not mean hoppy bitter, but more like a vegetable matter bitter. Finish was extremely dry, which is just the way I like my beers. I am not a sweet toothed person and bitter and dry suits me just fine. Do not pass up a chance to try this beer!",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,dsprainman,4.23,"First review here, so bear with me. Bottled 29/3/11 Poured into a Chardonnay glass A- 1-2 fingers off-white head with an amazing opaque amber body. The body truly catches the light of the room and shows a lighter amber and darker orange hue. S- Scents of pears and light hoppyness give this beer a rather refreshing nose. T- Flavors of light pears and mild hops give this beer a refreshing taste. Taste follows the nose very well. M- This is what truly sets this beer apart from many other Belgian offerings. An almost Champagne like effervescence takes the delicate taste to the next level. O- A great, refreshing summer sipper, with petite nuances that Trappist's are known for. Also, at 6.2% ABV, this one can be enjoyed without quite as much caution as some of the other Belgian heavy hitters. Defiantly a good choice, that I would buy again.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,output01x,4.42,"Poured from a 330 mL. bottle (Best Before 05/19/2015) into a tulip glass.  A slow pour let's loose a giant 3-finger cream-colored head. The body is an orange amber with jets of carbonation bubbles practically racing to the surface. The head recedes after quite some time to a thick, clumpy covering and thin foam ring. Thick lacing clings to the sides of the glass in large clumps.  Belgian yeast gives this beer a truly delicious smell. Aromas of green apples and white grape juice really make this beer mouth-watering. Floral hops in the background lend a little character to this beer.  Green grapes and pears lend a light flavor at first sip. A light floral and somewhat grassy hops flavor settles in that goes quite nicely with the fruit flavors. A slight spiciness sets in at the end of each sip. The flavors here are not bold by any means, but are elegant and playful.  Medium bodied with strong carbonation, this beer is as drinkable as it is delicious (which can be quite dangerous). Without being watery, this beer is easily sipped and gulped. The carbonation seems to be just right as it does not get in the way of the flavor but really helps to move this beer along.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,hopsbreath,5,"I actually just tried this beer for the first time a couple weeks ago, so I could harvest the dregs for a saison I was brewing. The dryness and complexity blew me away. Suddenly, every beer I brew is getting Orval dregs in it just so I have an excuse (as if I really needed one) to drink more of this beer. Every store I go into now I'm picking up bottles and checking the date. This review is for the oldest bottle I have found so far. It's ""bottled on date"" is 5-6-2008 (day first month second). Poured into a Duvel tulip, this review is being done live.  A: A very careful pour still yields a couple fingers of buttered popcorn head. The bubble composition itself is made up of big lazy bubbles with a rocky texture on top. Belgian lacing galore is left all over this thing. The body itself is a deep butterscotch with excellent clarity. Beer does not look more tempting than this. 5/5  S: Think tart green fruits here. Green apples, pears, lime zest, muscat grapes, and kiwi (yes kiwi) are among this fruit basket. An inviting sweetness I'm going to compare to the inside of a salt water taffy shop, is lingering just behind the classic earthy aroma of the brett. Beer does not smell better than this. 5/5  T: An impact of spice to the taste buds make this all about the yeast. Peppercorns, cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, cardomon... The list can go on and on. Dusky melon rind, bitter grapefruit pith, and avocado essence are all characteristics of what this base malt has turned into. Beer does not taste better than this. 5/5  M: A huge mouth of foam in every gulp. The swallow reveals a sawdust dry finish. It's drier than any Champagne I've had. It might be the single driest drink I have ever drank. A perfect beer for classy parties, celebrations, and weddings. I'll have to keep that in mind. Beer does not get drier than this. 5/5  O: Why oh why did I wait so long to try this out. Without a doubt one of the most unique beers I've enjoyed to date. It's also a beer I'll be returning to with some regularity. To have such a fantastic beer on the shelf of every upscale grocery store is truly remarkable. Beer DOES NOT get any better than this. 5/5",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Damn hoppy for the style, just what I expected and a lot more, noble hops with some floral notes for good measure, pretty dry malt aromas. Taste is tres hoppy, a revelation for a trappist beer, absolutely unique, hops up front, a bit of malty sweetness in the middle, bready malts to dry out palate towards end, and a mild hoppy back end. Mouthfeel is on the light side of medium, happy mouth effervescence. I imagine aging will tame the hoppiness a bit, but relatively fresh, well, this is one world class beer.

37,129,BMoldy,4.36,"Pours a luscious peach/dark gold color with a substantial, fluffy, two-finger head that exhibits excellent retention and lacing. Initial aroma of delicate piney/herbal hops, followed by a variety of fruity esters (apple, melon). Taking a sip, some dry fruit rinds first come to mind, followed by a wave of almost musty yeast, a little bit of spice, and fresh tropical fruit (mango keeps coming to mind, maybe pineapple). The grain merely serves as a conduit for these other great flavors. Bitterness follows, and the beer ends on a long, dry note. Carbonation is mild and very fine, while the body is soft and almost creamy. The alcohol isn't felt at all in the mouth... only in the head, if one enjoys this brew too fast!  There is so much at work here it's really quite amazing. All of the flavors blend together fantastically, and the dryness and range of fruity notes make this beer truly stand out. Not necessarily the first thing that comes to mind when one thinks of a Trappist brew, but very unique and surprisingly refreshing.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,20ozmonkey,4.02,"Drank this as a victory beer after spending way too much time buildiing an Ikea bed. Poured into a Chimay goblet.  Hazy amber color. Tiny bubbles pillowing in the center.  Smells very floral with a honey sweetness that I'm having a hard time pinning down, but I'm liking it.  I've not had a Belgian quite like this. It's very light and refreshing with lots of copper on the middle of the palate. Bready and bitter on the finish. This isn't the Belgian yeast bomb that I'm used to. This has a very smooth mouthfeel. There is lots of carbonation but it only slightly tingles your mouth versus giving it a burning feeling.  I've been eyeing this beer for quite some time and I'm glad I finally picked one up. I'll probably get more in the future.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

A: Pours a hazy orange color, darker than most Belgian Pales I've personallyu come across, with a huge (2+ finger) lively white head on top. 4.5  S: Yeasty, spicy, and lemon-zest shine through. 4.0.  T: Smooth at first, with notes of yeast and earthiness. Hops add some bitterness in the middle, and the taste finishes with a lingering lemon-zest that accompanies the hops nicely.  This is particularly well-balanced. Not quite as *bright* as Bruery Mischief with it's hops, but has a stronger earthy/lemony presence throughout. 4.5  M: Light and smooth, with lively carbonation levels. The finish? It almost disappears, leaving just a hint of earth and lemon zest on the tongue. Rather pleasing. 4.0  D/O: I can see why this beer gets such good reviews. It's very well balanced, full of flavor, and easy to enjoy. It didn't hold up quite as well as I would have hoped as it warmed, but I could follow this up with another and be happy. I will be repeating. 4.5",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,justintcoons,3.71,"A: Pours a hazy amber with golden highlights. Low-medium carbonation and two fingers of fluffy white head that dissipates slowly give way to some excellent lacing.  N: Pear, apple, lemony citrus and grains.  T: Lemon, orange zest and some barnyard. Muted pear and apple with notes of tangy apricot make an appearance along with light grains throughout. Finishes dry and earthy along with some floral hop notes.  M: Medium bodied, prickly, sudsy and dry.  O: Showcases the grain nicely. Good citrus and light fruit notes. Moderate bitterness, light and refreshing. Overall I'm not too impressed by this Trappist ale.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,AdamBear,4.34,"A-dark honey colored with a thin light cream colored head  S-smells like bubble gum and caramel...really sweet smelling. Though, every time i take a whiff, i pick up something new...its a good scent  T-comes in with a bitter taste of bananas, apples, and caramel sugars. it lasts awhile and in come dark belgian malts. the after-taste is slightly fruity with some slightly roasted belgian sugars. these are extremely quality and complex. i'm getting some grape skin taste as well.  M-good medium carbonation that fills the mouth with a crisp finish  O-okay, so while i was drinking this, i didn't realize its was a BPA. in fact, it reminds me of no other BPA i've had...its much better than the rest. this is just an amazing beer. it drinks so much quicker than any other belgian i've ever had. it also is so beautifully complex and the flavors are just great. i really love this beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,KAP1356,4.35,"Poured from the bowling pin looking bottle into a pint glass (all that was available at my future sister-in-law's house)...  A - Pours a hazy orange color that leaves a giant, foamy eggshell white head about 3 fingers thick (I poured carefully this time to avoid what normally happens when I pour this beer.)  S - Nice floral notes, yeasty and spicy as expected. Some nice sourness to it as well mixed with some nice acidity. Lemon peel, orange zest, some grape as well.  T - Grassy and earthy from the hops. Nice citrus acidity adds to the profile as does some pepper and corriander. Some other light fruits (green apple, grape, etc) make an appearance as well. Almost some Brett like characteristics coming from this one that I didn't remember the last few times I have tried this.  M - Medium bodied beer with a high carbonation level. Nice champagne-like qualities make this one enjoyable on the mouth.  O - Really nice Belgian Pale Ale that was very refreshing to drink.

37,129,McNealc31,4.5,"Orval pours a hazy orange with a magnificent head that'll take some taming. Lots of sweet orange, spice, and lemon zest in the smell.  The taste is very unique. Lots of champagne qualities. Quite sour and a big bitter hop bite at the back end. There's quite a bit of lemon and pepper in here, too. Most of the flavor is coming from the hops and yeast, as I'm not getting much malt here. You won't find many beers with this much carbonation, either.  Exceptionally complex and interesting. I've never had anything quite like Orval.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,BabySnakes,4.38,"Whoa. Poured it staright down the center and almost the entire glass was a tannish color head instantly. Incredible lacing that ends in thick clumpy gobs.  Mostly Copper with some orange hue. Very solid and dense/cloudy.  Faint maltyness with an orange accent aroma. Slight barn/horse/belgian wafts. Not too much overall aroma, maybe inhibited from the pour?  Nice orange flavor comes thru, solid malt base. Barnish/earthy flavors in the finish along with a spiciness.  Excellent mouthfeel. More carbonated than your average beer. Starts medium heavy bodied from the malt but the dry finish helps to keep it a solid medium. Spicy flavor finish is felt in the mouth also. An excellent earthy BPA as opposed to a more dry, hoppy fruity offering like Ommegang's.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,wvsabbath,4.48,"Serving Type - Bottle  Appearance - Dark brown/tan, insane 4+ inch creamy head, tons of lacing. About as pretty looking a beer as you can get.  Smell - VEry floral, spicey, malty, yeast. Sugars, tons of spices, grape, orange, plum. Grassy and earthy, with lemon mixed in.  Taste - Very hoppy and spicey. Lots of lemon and orange corriander. Grassy yeast makes a pungent flavor. Spices are plentiful and add tons of flavor. Green sour apple adds major boldness. Alcohol is masked well.  Mouthfeel - Very intense. Lots of flavor. Mouth is worked over quite well with bitterness, floral sweetness, and hop bite. Aftertaste is acidic, spicy and long lasting.  Overall - Is this a farmhouse ale? Very different from the other trappist ales, this one is more sour and bitter, and hoppy. For a different twist on belgium ales, this is the ticket. Honestly not my favorite but worth drinking every few months for a nice change up.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

The aroma is very complex with tons of tart fruit. Lemon, candied orange rind, grape skins, green apples, and pear with a complex blend of spices too. Black pepper, coriander, clove and nutmeg notes. Grassy and floral hops peek through and tons of yeasty farmhoue funk.  The taste has a background of wet hay and white wine, with tart green apple, pear, grape, and orange zest. Some slight candied sugar notes and spices. Black pepper, cloves, coriander and lemon peel. Grassy and earthy notes with plenty of barnyard funk.  Hazy cloudy, medium bodied and higly carbonated.

I don't really get the brettanomyces funk that I was expecting, but not really overly familiar with this class of beers, so maybe I am just not sure what to look for. Overall very good beer, very refreshing and pleasant to drink.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Rijtjeshuis,4.35,"Served in a chalice  LOOK (4.5/5) Pours a deep gold with some strong orange in there. I'd call this brew hazy, but not totally opaque. Three fingers of big, cream colored and textured head was produced. This fell to a cap pretty quickly, with some nice lacing. The cap lasted for most of the beer.  SMELL (4.5/5) The comes in first with biscuit and vienna malt; the latter added a bit of apricot fruitiness. The malts are followed quickly by a great yeast/hop blend that is so complex and unique, it's hard to untangle. The yeast brings some fruit, flowers, and black pepper. The hops are citrus, spicey and herbal.  FLAVOUR (4.5/5) Similar to aroma. The hops play a bigger role on the palate than the nose - the overall character was the same, but more pulled into the orbit of the hops. This is also a good and bitter brew with more hop character than most BPAs I've had. Some earthy (maybe even mild a brett) notes are there.  FEEL (4/5) Medium-full bodied with medium-high carbonation. This makes for a fluffy mouthfeel. Hop bitterness gives a lot of kick and plays with the tickle of the spice and carbonation. Very nice and on par for a BPA.  DRINK (4.5/5) The complexity encourages further drinking to figure it out and also because it makes a delicious fugue. It is not that highly drinkable compared to others of the style (like Leffe Blond), but it is FAR superior in flavour and complexity.  I liked this, the power of the hops almost made this reminiscent of a Belgian-IPA (a style I love).  Good job, monks.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,BarryMFBurton,4.48,"I can honestly say that I have yet to be underwhelmed by any of the Trappist Ales I’ve sampled. Rochefort, Westmalle, Chimay…that “Authentic Trappist Product” logo is pretty much the bottle’s way of saying “you WILL enjoy this beer.” And the monastery-brewed story behind each one makes the drinking experience that much more special. Here we have one that I’ve been after for quite a while: Orval. It has always been on my list to look for, but I wasn’t really searching for it until I read an article about the Bros. trip to the monastery in Belgium where it’s brewed. After hearing about all the culture and tradition that went into the beer, I had to try it. Luckily, it wasn’t long until I found a liquor store within a reasonable distance that had it. I made the trip, paid my $6 for the famous teardrop bottle, and now I’ve got it in my glass. Here’s to hoping it’s worth the trouble I went through to get it!  A: As soon as I opened the bottle, the fizz started erupting. A loud hiss, then a stream of bubbly foam oozed from the lip like a bottle of old champagne. Beautiful. The notice on the side of Duvel’s bottles, “Pour Unhurriedly,” popped into my mind like a warning light; so that’s what I did. Still, a lot of good foam finds its way on top of my beer, showcasing a creamy, micro-bubbled beige. Excellent retention and some great lacing, as well. And just like champagne, a myriad of bubbles can be seen rising through the body, which gleams with a dark amber shine. This is one of the best looking beer I’ve seen thus far. Wow.  S: My first thought: wine. The grape and apricot sweets are so big that it makes this nose more comparable to a semi-dry port, or even sweet vermouth. There are some very evident beer aspects, of course, but they come mostly in the form of a bright, bottom-layer yeast aroma that only serves to enhance the sweetness of the front-end fruits. Apart from the sweets, there’s a dryness that exists, too; however, it shows up completely in the back-end as the signature of a rich note of fine alcohol. A very pleasant nose, albeit in a different way.  T: I love how every Trappist I have is so incredibly unique that it could never be mistaken for one of its counterparts. For instance, this one is so incredibly fruity and bitter – but not in an intense way. It is light on the tongue, especially in the realm of sweets; and, judging from the nose, one would expect an almost cloying sweetness. But that’s not what this beer is about. Fruit tastes bounce from sweet, juicy apples to the semi-bitter tinge of grapefruit, all the way around to full on zesty orange rind. Hops show up too, in a surprising proportion; they mix well with the bitter aspects of the fruits, though, so they’re more than welcome. Yeast is always a key attribute to great balance in a Belgian ale, and it’s safe to say that Orval knows what they’re doing in that respect. They come in gradually, keeping this one light with a tart, lemony kick. Soon after, though, they bring the palate back down to Earth with a smooth meatiness that seems to be found almost exclusively in Belgian ales. The aftertaste comes out dry; a fitting end to pale ale like this. Overall, a solid palate that, although not incredibly thick, is unique.  M: Slightly thin for my tastes, unfortunately. What can I expect with a 6.9% ABV pale ale, right? It’s still very drinkable, though; I don’t want to make this aspect of the beer out to be a huge source of discontent for me.  O: A booming nose, exquisite taste, and superb look converge in classic style. Orval is swimming with history, and, as I have just learned, swimming with flavor, too. This would be a perfect dinner beer with so many different dishes – I may even consider cooking with it in the future. And, while it isn’t my favorite Trappist, you can certainly add this beer to my list of “Reasons to Visit Belgium.”",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,CuttDeez,4.25,"Poured from a bottle into an oversized wine glass.  A - A slightly hazy body with a nice golden color and a big frothy peaky white head. The hed is resiliant as well. The carbination of the beer is somewhat constant as well making it look very nice.  S - The nose is very pleasant. The citrus notes are prevelant throughout. There are some grassy earthen tones underneath it and what makes it interesting and complex is the slight funk that builds on the nose.  T & M & D - Good hop profile here with a great variety of fruits represented. The other note that comes out is the sour funk in this beer. I love the complex mix of the fruits and funk, they mingle well and work off one another. The final notes i pick up are the spices and pepper the play in the back of the taste and in the nose. The carbination makes the body of the beer a little lighter, crisper, and refreshing. It makes the drinkability great as well.  O - A great beer. It reminds me of one of my favorites (pannepot 2007 with the feel and the funks). I would recommend this to anyone. A great sipper and a good beer to explore flavors.  -Cheers",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,ahq514,4.28,"Poured from 11.2 oz bottle into snifter. Bottled 4/22/10.  This beer pours a massive head, as it is super carbonated, and cloudy bright orange. Had to let it set for a several minutes before it settled. After it settles out, there is some beautiful lacing going on.  Aroma is very complex, smells earthy. Spicy belgian yeast, floral hop character, and some slightly sour lemon. Some other spices are there too, maybe some coriander?  Taste starts off with some lemon, then moves on to a little bit of orange. Getting some nice earthy and floral flavors mixed in with those fruits. Getting a nice spicy yeast/coriander flavor in there too. Has a slightly bitter finish, but not overly so.  This is a pretty carbonated beer as was expected. On the lighter side of medium bodied.

Appearance-Vigorous carbonation bursts forth from the bottle-Beer is golden orange with a giant rocky head of off-white foam. Head retention is decent. Also moderately clear, but there seems to be a the slightest cast of haze.  Aroma-Holy god that smells good. Big Belgian yeast character with some notable Brett character as well. Spicy, slightly clove like phenolics, lemon peel, hay, horse blanket, and grassy/spicy hops. There is also some acidic tartness, and a faint mustiness. Malt is just slightly bready, and on the back end, the brett is a little bit floral.  Flavor-Slightly fruity/citrusy (lemon) up front before being dried out by high attenuation and moderate hop bitterness. Hop flavor is grassy/spicy, and there is a distinct lemon-drop tartness that carries through the entire flavor. Brett character is less pronounced than in aroma, but still contributes some slight hay and barnyard flavors. Aftertaste smacks of herbal hops, lemon peel, and Brett.  Mouthfeel-Medium body with very high, effervescent carbonation. Awesome tongue scrubbing action.  This is always an exciting beer, as I feel like every time i've ever had it, it's slightly different. This particular bottle was not quite as delicious as some that I've had (though still quite tasty), but smelled like heaven.

The taste is different from the way it smells, there is very little sweetness up front, maybe a little citrus fruit and malted wheat, a little peppery and lemon hints but its mostly dry / bitter on the way down with a little alcohol burn, very tasty.

The taste of the beer is a little sweet upfront with some yeast and spice in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was medium bodied and had a good amount of carbonation to it.

Very complex. Every sip encourages you to study the nuances of the flavors involved.  M: light body, perfect ally to taste  I have been chugging craft beer for about four years now and this is THE BEST that I have found.... yet.

37,129,magictacosinus,4.45,"Served in a Chimay glass, bottled on 02/10/11.  Appearance: Pours a magnificent, giant head with a bold amber color. The head maintains throughout.  Smell: Dried fruits, such as apricots, as well as granny smith apples! It contains a spiciness that creates an immediate tingling sensation on the nose. The Belgian yeast is instantly identifiable here, as with all Trappist ales.  Taste: A thick yet smooth taste. Hard to describe, really. There nevertheless is a wonderful dryness to it. A honey-tinged, fruity sweetness seems to overpower my palate.  Mouthfeel: Definitely has the smooth yet foamy resemblance to champagne. Unlike champagne, however, Orval contains a bitter aftertaste. As it warms up, it becomes considerably smoother and far tastier.  Overall: A truly fantastic beer, and what I feel is a prototype for what a Belgian pale ale should be. The hops are strong and flavorful but do not overpower the taste of the beer. The amount of malts in this ale allow it to be a creamy and tasty experience. While it gives a nice little warming buzz after by the end, I'd consider it be an ideal beer to have during the summer. If I'd ever want a beer that is flavorful and dry yet not too intense, like a Duvel, I would pick this one up again.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Clove and lemon up front as well. Tartness all over with a very dry finish. Perfect balance. Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation, medium body. Overall: Because of the wild fermentation process, I always call this beer the geuze beer under the trappist beers. This beer is so unique, so perfectly balanced, on of the best trappist beers out there. I love it!

37,129,nokes,4.03,"From notes  This is not a style I'm very familiar with. I think the only other beer I've tried in this style is the Leffe Blonde (which I like quite well).  Poured into a Leffe chalice to reveal a moderately carbonated apricot ale with a nice just-off-white head, not as rocky and pillowy as a Duvel, for example, but nice, with good retention. Looks good.  Smell is really quite interesting. I get citrus and grass with an earthy (wet dirt) background and some mild fruitiness. Not sure I like it lots, but it's not boring.  This is a pretty complex beer. Grapefruit and clove, some banana on the first sip but then really not seen again for most of the rest of the beer. What really does come out is that odd earthiness, like there wet dirt and leaves, which is interesting next to the fruity parts that come through...it just changes and shifts so many times, it's hard to keep up. Do I like it? yes. Love it? Not sure...I think it takes getting used to.  Mouthfeel seems just about right for this beer. I like the carbonation and the smooth way it seems to facilitate all the taste shifts.  Overall, this is a pretty cool beer. I don't know whether I'd seek it out or not. Maybe that's just my taste though. It's certainly a very interesting beer worth trying.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,kevo237,4.33,Poured from bottle into a Chimay goblet. Head retention was great throughout. Very nice looking beer. The head almost looked like whip cream.  Smell was sweet and floral. I continued to get the image of baby blue skittles in my head when I was drinking this beer. It definitely has a candied taste that is hard to describe while having a spicy characteristic. Mouthfeel was excellent as with most trappiste brews. Sizzled on my tongue and went down smoothly with no carbonation build up in my throat. Definitely one of my favorite trappiste beers.,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

It looks great in the glass.  Smell: Smells fresh if not a little earthy like sweet, cold, wet leaves. There's a hoppy character, but the smell is largely diminished - it's not a very strong smell. Nose is mildly sharp and musty.  Taste: Hoppy character is prominent - tastes fresh and bitterly sharp. Very crisp and while it's heavily carbonated, the bubbles aren't very big so it's pretty smooth.  Mouthfeel: This beer has a large chalky taste. It feels as if I've recently swallowed a bit of dirt or dust. It attacks the tongue and sits at the back of the throat for a while. Finishes pretty mild.  Overall: This bottle is almost two years old and I'm not sure if that's what is affecting the nose on it. It's pretty good, though I'm not particularly fond of the way it hangs at the back of the throat. It really tastes like someone mixed dirt into the mash - doesn't ruin the beer for me, but I'm not sure I'd get it again.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Pours a hazy straw color with three fingers of bubbly off white head. Real nice retention on this. Settles down with some soapy lace.  A little bit of white grape juice on the aroma. Kind of reminds me of an ice wine. A little bit of spicy floral hops. A little bit of sweet candied orange in the aroma. Dry flavors here. A little peppery with a little bit of fruit juice to the flavor. The flavors are a little bit two dimenional but on point and refreshing.  Light body with soft carbonation on this one.

Alcohol comes through as the beer sits...  M- Med body beer that leaves the mouth a little dry, but in a good way. Carbonation is good, but nothing special in the mouthfeel.

In this case, that made a big difference. I think the bottle wasn't very fresh. Ouch.  Oh well. Still a great beer, if a little dusty. Nice balanced body, pours beautifully; it's sweet, and memorably bready. That's the quality that sticks, and out of a draft, it's just great.

Appearance: Slow pour gave a cloudy orange-brown-amber beer with a massively thick and persistent tan foam. Bubbles slowly coming up through the beer. Delicate strands of lacing all over the glass. Outstanding looking beer.  Smell: Sweet, floral, and something else that I cannot place. Forest fruits? Definitely something fruity in that sweet flavor. I'm not getting any of the potential ""Brett"" funk I hear about. Not very strong in smell, but still very nice in that I keep taking really deep inhales and liking it more each time I smell it.  Taste: Does not taste like it smells at all which is throwing me off as I try to taste it. Earthy flavor up front, moving into an unusual bitter finish. Some phenol in here as well. As it warms up some of the malt comes through in the middle, but the earthiness and bitterness dominate here.  Mouthfeel: Prickly carbonation on the tongue, almost airy at times. Slick and coats the throat nicely.  Overall / Drinkability: I had this before about a year or more ago, and I didn't get it. So now some time later and more educated, I find I still only want one and I'm done. So not very drinkable in that I want more, but a very ineresting beer to have due to the appearance and complex smell/taste combinations.

Smell: Flavorful apples, very very slight banana undertones, some yeast and malt. Notes of dryness, fresh grass and an earthy connotation finish out the brew. Very complex and very balanced.  Mouthfeel: Rich, full and creamy. The carbonation is perfect. Orval goes down exceptionally smoothly.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

I could smell this beer indefinitely and never get tired of the smell. In fact, I don't even feel the urge to drink it, rather I just want to stick my nose in the glass!  When I finally get around to drinking this Trappist ale, I was brought to another place and time. A citrus-like, refreshing taste transports me to the Belgian countryside during a sunny summer afternoon under a shady tree. It ends quickly with crisp and tart finish. Incredible!

Bottled 01/06/2010, about a year and a half old.  4.5 A: Plenty of carbonation in this one. The first pour yielded 80% head. Hazed medium orange color. Second pour gave me a full glass. Three fingers of pillowy white head with excellent retention. Rather than just lacing, there are gobs of head permanently stuck to the sides of the glass.  5.0 S: Wonderful! Loads of funk in here: horse blanket, musty basement, and old socks. Peppery spiciness, perhaps a touch of clove, lemongrass, old hay, peach, and wild apple.  5.0 T: Again, wonderful! Barnyard funk, horse blanket, dank wet basement, and wet hay. Below that is pepper, clove, and tumeric spiciness. Mega earthy overall. Hints of what were grassy and earthy hops. Peach fruitiness again with crab apple. Sweet in the middle and drying on finish.  4.0 M: Lighter medium body. A bit too much carbonation, but it is happily very spritzy and super smooth.  5.0 D: I've yet to have a bottle of this at any age that wasn't good, but it seems like 1.5 years is a pretty good place for it.

37,129,OneDropSoup,4.37,"Bottled on 1/6/10.  Poured into my complementary Orval chalice: Two fingers creamy, rocky, buoyant foam that drops to a finger & retains oh so well. Looks like a cloud. Body is a hazy, translucent burnt orange with brighter orange highlights.  Smell is wow. Overlaying brett character that's pointed but not too sharp, like a tart key lime pie, freshly mown grass, herbs, a little cherry, & that specifically Belgian grapiness in so many of their yeasts. Underlying are mildly creamy tones, a little graham cracker sweetness, even cocoa hints now & again. So complex, I want to sink into this. And that dryness keeps bringing me back. Fantastic.  A sip starts off with some of the spiciness & grape qualities but quickly dries out & becomes herbal & mineral, with a character that I've had before in Orval that I can only describe as ""stony,"" like licking a rock. Not bad, just interesting - it has a solid, dry bitterness to it. Unexpected at first, but it mellows & becomes pretty enjoyable, with some mildly orange sweetness backed by a slightly bitter zest. Mild tonic note.  Mouthfeel is medium-full, very smooth & velvety. That dryness sticks around & hangs on the palate.  Man, this is one complex beer. Some very subtle notes hanging back in this to pay attention to. I can't say I loved every movement I went through with it, but it was all about the ride, & the ups & downs all added to up to a great outcome.

Kind of annoying how much head comes from this beer, regardless of how gentle the pour. Appears bright orange with a gargantuan off-white head that sticks all over the sides of the glass. Smells like crisp/tart fruit (pear, green apple), yeasty funk, hay, bready malts, and spices. The taste is very similar to the smell, bready malts and funk up front, followed by hay and an assortment of spices, tart fruit in the finish along with a dry serving of funk.

Its like a herbal and peppery spice. Then Yeast is tasted next, but does not overtake the the spiciness of this beer. Mild tasting funk and citris too.  Mouthfeel: Light bodied and crisp. High level of carbonation and refreshing. Almost seltzer like.

37,129,biegaman,4.95,"If there is ever one beer that it should be considered absolute blasphemy to drink straight out of the bottle, truly, Orval is it. Not only would that waste the illustrious chalice (designed by the abbey's architect) but you'd be missing out on what is surely the poster-boy for Belgian beers. The name Orval is derived from 'Val d'Or' (Golden Valley) and indeed, a beautiful and clear, glistening amber, the beer lives up to that billing.  The Inuits have so many words for snow, as many Asian cultures do for rice; I wish beer reviewers had the same for head. Orval's deserves its own word; its an unfailing ultra-lush marshmallow that climbs a mile high over the beer. It looks like the clouds themselves. They say a picture paints a thousand words, this one paints just one: gorgeous.  Just because a beer is brewed by monks doesn't necessarily mean it's holy - in Orval's case, however, it is. Heaven, I imagine, probably smells something like this - the beer does, after all, smell like God's feet. Every bottle is a religious experience. It is the distilled super-essence of acres of fruit orchards and flower gardens. Sweet bread and tart berries marry. Much of this magic is owed to the 'hocus pocus' of a wild yeast known as Brettanomyces.  Orval has the complexity of a beer its strength, yet the 6.9% alcohol has been completely deferred; I've never encountered a boozy bottle. If you look through most beer books - or at least all the ones that I have - you'll find plenty of information on the history of the abbey and its romantic legend, but you won't find much detailed description about the actual beer itself. Indeed, it's an intricate beer so unique that it's tough to describe...  Pressed, I'd say it tastes like a combination of pungent soft cheese, fresh warm bread and tart berry fruits. (Yeast is truly one of the world's last areas of magic!) It is perhaps the longest taste ever and is dry as a mid-summer breeze. Its carbonation is bubbly and brisk. Hops are a drop in the bucket but a fleeting taste of their earthy, leafy bitterness is readily noted. Such a treat to drink, and so balanced, Orval is true harmony in a bottle.  Orval is a drink that can turn savages into civilized men. Although as a rule I avoid making dramatic and subjective statements, I have no hesitation in saying this is the most perfectly crafted beer ever. And I know for a fact that some of the world's best brewers wouldn't hesitate to agree. Drink it once, remember it forever. If ever I had to chose a perfect beer...",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

In the taste I detect a slight sweetness as it first touches my tongue, then I get a slight bit of funk with some light malts, in the end of the taste I get some pepper as well.

Incredibly complex with a remarkably alluring brightness.  The palate also emphasizes the tartness though not enough to call this a 'sour'. Fruity notes are joined by a bigtime hoppiness (for a Belgian) with more flavors of dried straw and spicy yeast. The long, herbal finish is immensely dry and resinous to the point of being tannic.

37,129,Ryan011235,4.07,"Poured into an E&J Cask & Cream glass on 5/3/11  Bottled on: 1/6/10 Best before: 1/6/15  Whoa, there! carbonation. Boasting the loudest pop I've heard from a capped beer and a rushing, fizzy head that hits the two inch mark while cresting the top of the glass. The head immediately crackles away, large bubbles bursting throughout. After several minutes the aftermath finds sporadic chunks of lace and a thin layer resting o'er a faded, golden/amber colored beer. Swirling brings back a solid finger head and better lace.  The aroma seems fairly subdued but has enough going on to keep it interesting. A damp, Brett mustiness is entrenched in aromas of prairie grass, making for a wet grass notion. Light fruit notes, too: apple and pear. Soft floral tones. Swirling draws forth more of the mustiness. Faint suggestions of earth and spice.  The Brett character is far more apparent to taste and shifts through flavors that call to mind waterlogged tree stumps in a boggy marsh; stale air in a flooded basement; chalk; dust and dirt (the latter of which props up the finish and lingers). Intermittently woven there in are notes of grass, orange rind and lemon zest, apple and spices (perhaps a bit of clove and white pepper). Dry cracker hints. Stray fruit notions arise once or twice.  The feel is between medium and light. Despite the depth of funky flavors, this critter maintains a bit of crispness in body. To that end, my biggest gripe is carbonation; it's overly vigorous and washes over the flavor profile. It's something of a chore shaking through the fizziness to fully appreciate the intricacies of the beer. As mentioned before, the finish is dirty. The aforementioned chalk, dust and dirt certainly play into the fell, as well as the taste.  Aside from the overbearing carbonation (took three aggressive swirls to tame the second pour) this is pretty enjoyable.

The beer is almost one year old and seems to have lost its hop aroma. I’m mostly getting some sour, funkiness with some berries. Taste is tart-not quite sour-but the hops are there, albeit faint. Medium bodied with creamy texture. Finish is bitter and dry. My tastes have changed a great deal since I last had an orval and I like it much more now.

S: Fruity overtones - watermelon and some banana mixed with bready yeast and sweet malt.  T: Lemony/citrusy followed by yeasty and sweetness that's indescribable until you taste it. It's an interesting mix of fruit/funk/earth/yeast/malt that's quite unlike any beer I've ever had.  M: Frothy, creamy which is to be expect from such a large-headed beer.

37,129,StoutHunter,4.2,"I picked up a bottle of Orval Trappist Ale for $5.49 at The Lager Mill. I have been meaning to try this beer for a while now but for some reason I just never got around to it, so I decided to stop procrastinating and give it a try, so lets see how it goes. Poured from a brown 11.2oz bottle that is shaped like a bowling pin into my goblet. This bottle is over a year old it was bottled April 22 2010, I guess it should be good till 2015, didn't know this brew would hold up for that long.  A- The label is pretty simple but it works well with the weird bottle shape and has a ""Trappist"" look to it. It poured a nice looking golden orange color that was clearer then I expected. It had four and a half fingers worth of huge fluffy white head that died down to a thick layer and left some spotty lacing.  S- The aroma is very nice and fruity, it almost reminds me of a hard cider. I pick up some green apples, white grapes, and some tart cherry's. I also pick up some floral aromas along with that signature Belgian yeast. There was some barnyard funk aromas once it warmed up.  T- This brew tastes pretty different from what I was expecting. The flavor is full of light fruit flavors, similar to the aroma just lighter and more subtle. The fruits, mainly, apples, cherry's, and white grapes blend together nicely and are pretty tart. In the middle I picked up a little funk that I wasn't expecting and some spices from the Belgian yeast. The finish had a slight floral hoppy bitterness to it.  M- Medium light bodied and smooth with a pretty dry finish. The carbonation was pretty high and could have been toned down just a little, but that didn't hurt it too much.  Overall this was a pretty good Belgian Pale Ale the best and most traditional one I have had to date. The aroma and look of this beer was awesome and the flavor was subtle yet pretty complex. It wasn't as flavorful as some of the American versions I have tried but it made up for that with it's complexity and the subtle flavors and great body made this beer have some great drinkability, this would hit the spot on a warm summer night. It was a little expensive but I feel it is worth the price to enjoy this beer once in a while. If you like Belgians this is a must try, a great old school brew.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Hop bitterness, along with a delicate herbal hop flavor, balances the sweetness quite well but is not overpowering. Earthiness, leather, and musty character. Just a hint of the slightly-tropical fruitiness that I get from Brett-finished beers, finishing with more earthiness.  M - Light and crisp on the palate.  Overall - The legend lives on.

Great retention and left tons of foamy lace on the sides.  S: Very nice fruity aroma. I get apples immediately and some grapes, almost reminds of a white wine in a way. There is a nice floral/grassy aroma as well.  T: Again, light fruit flavors. The apples and grapes return, there is also some banana and a little bit of apricot. The flavor profile seems a bit weak compared to the strong aromas though.  M: Very smooth, medium bodied with nice carbonation.

37,129,ZenAgnostic,1.9,"EDIT: Original score was 4.5 / 3 / 3 / 3 / 3  Appearance - Big beautiful offwhite head with good retention. Foggy light amber brown body.  Smell - Fishy. Possibly a bad bottle? I don't know what to expect.  Taste - Sour and dry. Reminds me of a gueuze.  Mouthfeel - Okay on its own, but when combined with the taste just makes it a bit icky.  Overall - My least favorite Trappist so far. I suspect I may have gotten a bad bottle, so I'll have to give it a retry in the future.  EDIT: As promised, I gave this beer a second chance about half a year after the first review. Bottle was stamped 7/10/2010 and 7/10/2015 (I'm assuming those are the born on and drink by dates, respectively). The second time the beer was even worse, I scored it 4 / 4 / 1 / 1 / 1.

T: Comes on with fruity sweetness like mild peach and green pear, then quickly passes into a long note of bread and butter. Great grassy hop profile in here. Some saltiness on the end. Very crisp and dry (read not bitter but tiddied up) finish.  M: Big and foamy bordering on chewy.  O: Wow, impressive beer. The alcohol snuck up on me because it was so easy to drink.

Nose is bright and funky, telltale Brett. Bright lemon-lime up front, herbal, cracked pepper, hay, barnyard. Mouthwatering and inviting.  Lacks much of the brightness on the palate, replaced by a dry earthiness. Prickly and light, almost fluffy. Still funky, but not in a mouthwatering acidic way. A bit of the lemon-lime persists, but plays a small supporting role; adds enough zip and brightness to steer this beer away from being dreary. A touch of dry baking spice adds complexity.

37,129,roadhouse,4.36,"Poured it from an 11.2 oz. bottle into the Orval glass. This is one beer where you really do have to have the brewery's glass to fully enjoy it.  Appears a nice cloudy coppery orange. In the Orval glass it fades from golden on the bottom up to orange and it's just beautiful. The head on this thing is massive and it requires a very slow pour. Carbonation is drifting up like mad. Excellent head retention as well.  Aroma is spicy and earthy with Bretty tones of tart cherry pie with some yeastiness. Very delicate yet extremely complex.  The taste is immediately very spicy and yeasty with classic Belgian funk, and a very distant sweetness. Finishes earthy and slightly bitter with Bretty horsehair type flavors coming out as well. I wish the carbonation was slightly less because it ends up just foaming up in my mouth when I take a sip.  Mouthfeel is pretty light, maybe a bit too much carbonation for me personally, but it's nothing to complain about.  This is one of the most unique beers around, and again, I strongly recommend buying the Orval glass so you can fully enjoy it.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,bubseymour,4.43,"Appearance - Head of all heads. Poured slowly into tilted pint glass and turned to 90% head. Like other Belgians, the head is a pillowy, whip cream texture that you could eat wit a spoon. Murky yellow, brown wheat style appearance.  Smell - some lemon, straw and spice. Also definite funk and horseblanket.  Taste - This is very easy drinker with mild flavorings lots of horseblanket funk but perfectly balanced in all aspects and slight hop dry bite to finish.  Mouthfeel - head on lip feels like whip cream. Carbonation dances on toungue. Buttery finish. Very nice.  Overall - I can perfectly understand how this can be rated as a world class beer. I didn't give it a 5 overall, only because the color in appearance is a little off for my style of liking and the flavoring, although good in all aspects doesn't make me crave the tastes like other A+ beers I may have tried before. Excellent brew none-the-less and will drink this one as often as I can afford it.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,weizenbob,4,"330 mL bowling pin shaped brown bottle. Bottled 3/25/10. I've always wondered; does the purchase of beer brewed by Trappist Monks count as tithing? Can I deduct this on my taxes? I popped the cap and poured the bottle into a large wine goblet. The pour winds up being about 60% head to 40% beer but the head quickly settles to about two fingers tall. The head itself is frothy and tinted a nice khaki color. Many isolated spots of lace stick to the glass. The beer is amber colored and lightly hazy. Fairly active carbonation continues to rise.  The aroma is funky. Fruity essence of pear and apple effortlessly waft out of the glass. Pineapple is faintly noted. The mild scents of clove and cinnamon are perceivable. It really has its own thing going on. I've encountered no other beer with which to compare this aroma.  The flavor is sour and fruity. Brettanomyces has had its way with this brew and is no doubt a major contributor to Orval's complexities. The initial bite is tartly lactic in taste with a light melon tinge. It's not puckering but it is an immediate reminder that this beer is not going to appeal to everybody's tastes. Earthy malt flavors and yeasty funkiness pop up in the background but are kept in check by the initial sourness and the late coming arrival of the taste of alcohol. The alcohol is of the candy sugar fueled variety. It comes on mellow and fades with little trace. The finish is dry.  The beer is fairly light bodied thanks to a respectable carbonation level and palate cleansing dryness. For all its oddness it is actually quite refreshing and thirst quenching. Orval is one of only a handful of brews that is truly one of a kind. It is pretty much a like it or hate it affair. It is complex and challenging to the palate but also rewarding to the faithful. The bottle listed ABV is 6.9% and the price carries a premium at $5-$6 a bottle, but realistically, this isn't the kind of beer you're going to drink by the case at a party. This beer is a conversation starter that demands your full attention.  ---  The Two-Schlitz Scale: (see my profile for an explanation) I give two Schlitz for Orval. Every beer drinker should experience this brew at least once.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,ghostdeini,2.46,"I was overall dissapointed in this beer because it is rated as world class.  I would rate this beer as below average espically for a belgian pale ale.  This beer really lacks in flavor, there were barely any hoppy notes and it was weak even as a belgian.  The beer did have a rediculous head that was over four fingers tall and does look very nice.

37,129,BFrost,4.37,"Poured from bottle into a Stella Artois glass. Beautiful hazy deep golden amber color with three fingers of dense, frothy tan head which sticks and leaves a nice, healthy lace.  Nose hints of hops and citrus, namely lemon, also a bit of sweetness you'd get from honeysuckle? Maybe one other thing I can't quite put my finger on, but it's very nice. I'd keep my nose in it all day!  Crispness of the carbonation fizzes right on the tongue, and then with a wisp of that lemony, lightly hoppy flavor. There are also light notes of honey and tart. It has a nice smooth, crisp, dry finish which would pair well with some sharp cheese.  Notes: Pale ale is just another style that the Belgians seem to get exactly right. It's not too hoppy or too bitter, or too dry. It's everything you want in a pale ale in all the perfect proportions. It is also very refreshing, and it reminds me of Spring. This is the perfect time to have one!",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Jugs_McGhee,3.58,"Poured from a bottle into a La Trappe goblet in Ghent, Belgium.  A: Pours a one finger head of little cream but decent thickness. Nontransparent caramel brown colour. Appealing.  Sm: Cream, caramel, fruit esters. Very hoppy.  T: Fruity body, mixed well. Very sweet - maybe the candy sugar had this effect. A bit of caramel. Very hoppy. Actually quite unbalanced, which is unfortunate. Built pretty well, but not special or unique.  Mf: Very coarse and dry for the style. Poorly executed. Doesn't complement the flavour at all.  Dr: I expected a better beer. I wouldn't have another, even at Belgian prices. Serve warm.  --- My last (above) review seemed rather sparse, so I decided to re-review in more detail. I love the design of the bottle; its iconic. Brown glass bottle with branded silver colour pry-off pressure cap and understated neck label acquired at a local bottle shop and served into an Orval stem-goblet in me parents' gaff in high altitude Castle Rock, Colorado. Reviewed live. Expectations are high given that it's a trappist brew. 6.9% ABV per the label. Bottled: 21/06/2013. Best before: 27/06/2018. No style (aside from the nebulous ""trappist ale"") is listed on the label, so I'm reviewing it open-ended, but as a Belgian style.  Served cold - straight from the fridge - and allowed to warm a bit over the course of consumption. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.  A: No bubble show forms as it's poured.  Pours almost entirely head - five fingers wide out of a possible six. It's white in colour, fluffy, and has a nice even soft complexion. Airy light consistency. Head retention is great - 10+ minutes. Uneven lacing clings to the sides of the glass as the head recedes.  Body colour is a clear translucent gold/copper with orange hues. Good vibrance. No floating yeast particles/sediment is visible.  Overall, it's looking pretty good for a Belgian ale. I wouldn't quite call it unique or special, but there are no overt flaws and both the head and colour are above average.  Sm: Fragrant perfumey Belgian yeast is the first thing I notice, with a distinct funkiness, vitamins, and some biscuity character coming through quite a bit. It's loaded with fruity esters; I find orchard apple and pear, a hint of faint orange, and something approximating peach. The crisp fruitiness is marvelous. I also find Belgian pale malts, clean barley, and hay. Hop character is an enjoyable mix of floral and fruity notes.  No alcohol is detectable.  A pleasant, soft, inviting aroma of moderate strength. The yeast character is a highlight for me.  T: Fruity esters are as abundant here as on the aroma. The body is comprised of Belgian pale malts, biscuit malt, and clean barley. It's slightly starchy as well. The Belgian/Trappist yeast is marvelous, featuring some subtle funkiness as well as biscuity vitamin-y healthy qualities. Hop character is fruity as well as floral. Pleasant and enjoyable; I like it. I do have some issues with the balance; it gets a bit earthy/herbal on the climax, which doesn't suit it well.  Complex for a Belgian pale, with some decent subtlety as well. But it isn't the masterfully constructed gestalt ale I've seen so many claim it to be. Nuanced, sure, but not particularly intricate. Average depth, duration, and intensity of flavour.  No alcohol or other off-notes come through.  Mf: Wonderfully soft on the palate - a characteristic I love. Near perfectly carbonated. The smoothness/wetness is thrown off by the starchiness of the flavour profile; it's almost stale. I don't know if I'd even call it refreshing. Decent thickness and body. Texture suits the taste decently, but is far from feeling custom-tailored to it.  Not oily, astringent, harsh, gushed, or boozy.  Dr: Very drinkable; I'll have no trouble killing the bottle. As much as I like it, I can't concede that it's up there with the best Trappist beers. I look forward to trying Petit Orval and to trying this with some age on it, but every time I try it I don't find it to be world class. That said, I've heard every bottle is a bit different, and that alone makes it a unique beer. I'll concede it's a classic, but I wouldn't recommend it to friends per se. I hope to visit the abbey one day and try it in its ideal setting. I could easily drink another. Certainly well above average.  It's absolutely worth trying, but let's not conflate being a classic beer with being a great one. That said, it grows on you the more you drink it. I could see myself appreciating this more and more each time I come back to it.  Low B",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Mouthfeel- Medium / light body, fairly spritzy carbonation. Dry, refreshing, champagne like. Overly drinkable.  Overall- I can't believe this is the first time I have had this beer! (Maybe it was the unassuming label) Instantly one of my new favorites. Probably the best Belgian Pale I have had.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,atlason,4.68,"Pours a somewhat hazy medium amber. Medium head retention with good lacing.  Taste is balanced and well integrated. Citrusy, spicy hops well balanced with slighly caramel flavored and weakly belgian yeast tasting malt.  Good velvety mouthfeel. Overall a very feel good beer with excellent drinkability. Could drink this all night. My favorite trappist ale.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,skandha,4.5,"Appearance: Comes in an elegant vase-like bottle with subdued label. Color in the glass is a bruised-apricot, muddled orange/brown with sparkling seafoam head.  Smell: Soft cherry overtones, with a confusing sweet spice blend that made me think of Dr. Pepper.  Taste: Distinctly tripartite. Pleasant stone fruit notes first (cherry, peach), followed next by an herbal bitterness...like nettle and dandelion greens as opposed to the usuall lemon rind. This fades into a soft, malty finish so long that it really could wake you up in the morning if you forgot to brush your teeth before bed.  Mouthfeel: Big! I so heady with foam that on first swig I almost snorted it out my nose. Full and creamy to be certain.  Overall: Delicious. Dry enough throughout to stand up to stronger cuisines, but so lingering and complex that I'd hate to spoil this three-part overture with soy sauce on the side.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,brewdenver,4.38,First of this is not my type of beer. I do not really enjoy pale ales but this is one I definitely had to try. With that said. Golden brown in color with heavy lacing and strong fingers. Previous review stated a sea foam head and that is spot on. Used a New Belgium tulip and even with it being .47L to the mark and probably .5L full the head rose slightly out of the glass. The glass does have a laser etching on the bottom that may have contributed to the larger than normal head. Smell is consistent with a pale ale. Strong hop aroma. Not quite Challenger hop but earthy and very green like. Taste has a sort of consistent flavor from beginning to end hitting you at first with some strong belgian hops with a nice balance of hop/sweet middle and finishing quite smooth and not too dry for my palette. Very active on the tongue and mouth with a sort of brut champagne feel. If I want to drink a pale ale this is the beer for sure. A definite beer to keep around to pair with when I make more spicy foods or blackened fish/chicken.,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,ReluctantScooper,4.2,"Bottle at the Nouvelle Hostellerie D'Orval.  Orval is a beer that's grown on me through the years. All leather and banana and cinnamon and grated lemon zest and fresh bread and dry spice and, and, and...  ... and it turns a cheese sandwich into a banquet. And when Orval's commercial director, Francois de Harenne, insists on pouring it for you as he tells you about the region's political history, it becomes a marker of surreality.  There's beer. There's Belgian beer. And then, there's Orval. Worth falling in love with over and over again.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Strangely astringent. Sour.  M: Mouth puckering. Light sting.  D: I just don't understand why my taste buds are so different from everyone elses.

The head retention is excellent, maintaining substantially throughout the experience.  The smell is of oranges, earth, and spicy goodness.  This beer is extremely creamy, with well attenuated pale malts, and vaguely soapy hops moving into leathery brett funk (moldy, but in a good way!). Rounding out the end is lingering funk and tannic astringency. The tongue is slightly warmed by alcohol alongside the aftertaste, which sticks around practically forever.  I've heard Orval derives its complexity from the Brett yeast used at bottling, and it's no joke. It really does add a new layer to something that might otherwise be 'just good.' Once I have the means, I'll be cellaring a few of these.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,KajII,3.88,"[Best served in a Trappist glass]  Poured a murky amber with some orange undertones and a huge white foamy head that was mostly diminishing but had fantastic lacing.  The aroma was heavy of a straw like malt, a moderate floral hop and a moldy scented yeast with notes of dried fruit (raisins), a hint of spice and some citrus (lemon and maybe orange) with a mild alcohol tinge.  It tasted a malty, a little bitter and slightly sour with a hint of a peppery spice in the beginning and finished lightly bitter and yeasty with notes of fruit, citrus and a slight alcohol tinge at the end. The flavor was left to linger for a while, leaving a light sourness on the palate.  Mouthfeel was light to medium in body and a little oily in texture with the carbonation being quite pronounced, almost prickly in feel.  Overall a fantastic Trappist Ale, I can see now why the Monks only brew this one beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Somewhat formed ring lacing on the drink down. Smells very floral, citrus notes, slight vinegar, and must/funk. Taste is of apple cider, lemon zest, grass/flowers, funk, and a bitterness that starts at the start of each sip. Bitterness is very herbal and is quite mild after each sip. The funk is from the Brett used in creating this beer. This beer is very carbonated and yields a huge head on the pour. The body is somewhat light but crisp and clean. Drinkability is good but this is a beer I can see myself only having occasionally. A very unique tasting and interesting beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,BBP,4.03,"A- An instant eruption of foam after popping it open. Filled the cup twice with head. Settled down and left a thick coating of lace over the glass. Considerably carbonated. Almost too much from the looks of it.  S- A clean herbal aroma filled with honey.A few notes of lemon. Quite unique for a beer. Reminded me more of tea really. Very earthy.  T- Complex and then some. Hops are quite prominent, but not assertive or dominant. Almost seems like a Belgian HopSlam due to the honey. Has a definite medicinal tinge to it. I've heard the term mustiness used to describe it a lot, but I feel like I need to describe it better. It has a ton of flavors that aren't sharp or fresh. It seems aged, and things seem blended rather than mixed. It enhances the character for me, but subtracts from the flavor. All in all, it balances out.  M- Creamy and medium full. The carbonation helps it to sit well, and is quite illusive. It finishes fairly dry.  D- Quite drinkable, but only when it warms up. I've had this cold, and it's a decision that I've regretted. I don't make a point to drink this at any other temperature than room temp.  It's a very unique beer, and there's not a lot like it, and while I appreciate that, it doesn't blow me away. I feel like it's both overrated and under-appreciated. A good beer and must try but nowhere near the top of my charts.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,Intrinsic,4.57,"Orval has the most intense head I've ever seen in a beer. This is likely because I served it too cold, but it persists even after the beer warms up. Its very frothy, almost like an Orange Julius but in beer form. It has a very nice cloudy amber colour.  Right away the smell really sets this beer apart from others. It has strong citrus notes, highlighted with spice and hops that come together in an almost perfect bouquet.  Perfect. Absolutely perfect. This beer is everything that a beer should be in terms of taste. Almost no sweetness at all, the up-front bitter hops assault your taste buds in a very pleasurable way. No flavour out of the myriad different notes overpowers the others. It is perfectly balanced.  This beer is very crisp, clean and dry. In fact, even 30 seconds later my taste buds are still trying to recuperate from the dryness of each sip. My only complaint (and I have a feeling this is my problem) is that it doesn't sit very well in my stomach. If I could drink more than one, and it wasn't so darn expensive, I'd drink nothing but this beer. Orval deserves the ""world class"" title it has.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

There are tons of swirling brown particles floating around in this, I really like the way all of the unfiltered parts make a web of shapes in the glass when you take sips. There is also a rather extreme amount of foamy off-white head that stays around for a while and leaves spotty lacing on the glass.  On the nose the most prevalent thing to me is the bready and sweet Belgian yeast that has an ever-so-slight circuity hint to it. The yeast I pick out of this smells amazing.  Flavor wise, its very well balanced. There is a mixture of sweetness and bitterness but is mainly dominated by the yeast. There are tons of delicate flavors that are almost indescribable but still present in this beer.  There is a certain dry crispness to this that reminds me of a hefeweizen. This beer is extremely drinkable given the abv and moderately high carbonation level.

Pours with a thick fluffy off-white head that leaves thick lace down the glass. Head retention is very good, slowly reducing to a thin layer. The beer itself is tawny or copper with some haze.  The scent of this Orval is musty and faintly reminiscent of citrus fruit. I think if you put an orange into a baseball mitt it might have the same aroma.  The taste is as unique as the scent. Some musty and citrus notes. Bitter with dominant hop flavor. The malts become more evident as the beer warms. The after taste is dry, hoppy and lingers long on the tongue.

I said I would revisit this beer, which I was planning on doing that same day anyway and thus, here is an updated review.  First tasted just about a year ago and then revisited on the 4th of March. Honestly, my opinion did not change a whole lot, but I was able to pick up on a few more subtitles and thus a bit higher grade.  Poured into a chalice, it had a nice frothy bright white head, about 2 inches that lasted a while.  Thin body, incredibly crisp and bitey; rabid carbonation. Mild note of candied sugar up front with a strong earthiness, crisp grassy hop presence with slight undertones of pine and citrus. Finishes with a clean bitterness and lingering earthiness with a slight tartness;lemon.

From the center of the snifter you can see a carbonation tunnel running up to the surface. Wow. Still waiting to drink this and becoming impatient as the relentless head remains. The color of the brew is an opaue golden orange color.  S- The nose is not offering much at first. Some citrus and port scents come through with a bit of honey mixed with some Belgium style yeast.  T- First I taste a glass/metallic taste, followed by a light nothingness, almost flavorless along side the overpowering carbonation and acidity. Overrated so far. A bit of citrus and yeast make this an okay sipper. Not a big fan but its pretty balanced.  M- Very crisp and light with an ample amount of carbonation.

37,129,BeardedRiker,4.12,"First of all, a warning: TAKE IT EASY WHEN POURING THIS BEER! The Orval Trappist Ale is one of those Belgians that produces a massive head if you don't pour it carefully. Pour slowly so you don't end up filling up the bottle opening and then having it come out in waves, thus creating an overly massive head.  That being said, the head on this is simply beautiful. It's so frothy that it is almost a creme. It fizzles away oh-so-slowly and keeps its form. The head is almost like an appetizer to the beer! The beer is a copper-orange color that has a steady but minimal amount of bubbles rising from the bottom. I have this Orval in my glass goblet.  I can smell the beer from where I am sitting. It smells as a Belgian ought to smell: fruity, sweet, and just a whiff of alcohol. Wow! This is an interesting beer. It reminds me a bit of Brooklyn's Local #1.  There is a lot of orange citrus flavor and the bubbly carbonation excites the tongue. Some peppery hoppiness is evident too. This is an extremely dry Belgian. It's smooth but probably the driest Belgian I've had. I don't taste any of the alcohol which isn't bad or good. Dry, orangey, sour, and peppery.  That sums up this interesting brew. Good stuff.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,TCHopCraver,4.62,"Reviewed from notes made on 2/11/11.  Holy head, Batman! Even with a ridiculously slow pour into a huge snifter, the fluffy, bubbly, light beige head reaches five fingers high. This buoyantly rests above a beautiful mahogany-amber-gold beer. Very speedy carbonation rushes from the bottom of the glass. Gobs of bubbly lace is left on the glass.  Tart, tart fruits are the name of the game in the smell. Really tart green apple, pear, lemon, lime, and sour cherries combine with an earthy funk to create an original, wild odor. Not in a bad way, sweet animal urine blends into the mix. The smell is also very spicy with notes of clove and pepper. This is a hugely unique smell and I love it.  Wow, the taste is a lot different from the smell. Instead of tart fruits dominating, the earthy-spice-funk grabs the headline. I do get some of the fruity tartness on the sides of my palate, but on the broad of my tongue is nothing but soil, spice, a bit of a phenolic flavor, and tangy funk. This is mostly from the yeast I would guess. AS it warms, the tart fruits do pop a lot more. Yeah, this changed a bunch as it warmed. The finish is deliciously dry and earthy.  Orval has a light to medium body, but the carbonation makes is seem much fuller. It is sparkly and effervescent on my palate for most of the sip with a lingering, bone-dry finish. Each quaff leaves me craving more.  Whenever I need a funky, tart Belgian fix in the future, this is where I will go. It is so enjoyably challenging to my palate and brain. I find this to be greatly drinkable and I would drink it so much more if the price tag wasn't so high. But, I expect to pay for quality, so I am not complaining.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Smells of citrus, apple, spices and whatever else they use to give it the famous character and aroma of this beer.  A little musty, spices, fruit, citrus tangy all on top of a yeasty belgian hop character with barley malt and little caramel or browned sugar.  Mouthfeel is superb. Enters tangy and becomes sweet with the malty and hoppy breadiness. Goes down smooth with a fine carbonation reminiscent of champagne.

A lot of hops, some citrus, spice and a slight hint of alcohol. Very dry finish, and a dry beer in general. Mouthfeel is good. You can feel the carbonation in your mouth, but it's not bothersome.

37,129,obrendano,4.65,"A - neat little bowling pin like bottle. beer pours a massive, massive head that I had to wait on a couple times to subside a little before I could keep pouring. beer is a hazy grayish gold with lots of bubbles making their way up  S - spicy dried fruit, excellent hop aroma, quite different than I expected  T - thick musty malt highlighted by a lemon-lime bite, hops are tart and noticeable, spicy cherry finish is warm and comforting. this is excellent  M - I really like how this feels, slightly heavy and sticky, and given less restraint I could down this like water  D - a pretty standout beer that doesn't follow the other routes of Trappists. I'd love to shake the hands of the monks that made it",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,TheBrewo,4.35,"We pour a glowing brew of golden orange. It supports a white head of two fingers, composed of soft miniscule bubbles that slowly dissipate. Chunky lacing appears around the glass as they go. The brew darkens with the last few ounces from the bottle, which are heavily yeast laden. Aside from the haze this produces, tiny flecks float about the glass, and carbonation looks to be standard. The nose fills with grain, a touch of wheat, faint booze, and orange hiding behind a huge curtain of brettanomyces. These blend further with medicinal phenols, furthering the warm and bitter bite of the aroma. As we sip, the mouth is bombarded with malts and that wild brettiness. These act synergistically to give a curious, but subdued, cherry flavor to the front. The middle mellows out, with heavy malts, bittering orange rind, and spices, with special attention given to coriander. We end on a nicely balanced note, with earthen hops coming in to cleanly meet the malts half way. Here, too, there is a leathery flavoring, certainly contributed to by the yeast. The latter breathes through the aftertaste, with a bit of citrus, and faint dry hops. The body is medium to full, and the carbonation is on the higher end. The brew is frothy and slurpable, and each sip comes equipped with some heady cream. With the mouth initially coated, it is left to quickly dry. The abv is appropriate and the beer drinks easily, but slowly.  Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was how unique it is for not only the style, but in comparison to the vast majority of Belgian beers. The use of brettanomyces yeast makes for a wildly inviting and different aroma than one might expect from a trappist, and goes even further in the taste, to change a standard pale into something entirely distinct.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,peensteen,4.36,"Pours a deep orange, 2"" thick white sticky head, sticky brussels lace that was perfect, I didn't want to wash it out of the glass...one of the best I've ever seen. Smells musty, yeasty, spicy, grain, malt, brett is wonderful here. Taste is slightly hoppy, funky, yeasty and grainy, good malt backbone. Nice mouthfeel, creamy, good carbonation that at times were leaning a bit on the high side.

S: Grain, grain, and some yeast.  T: Very interesting, but difficult to describe. Again, very grain-y, light malt flavor, with some spice in the middle, and a smooth gentle hop finish.  M: Lovely - buoyant and mouth-filling, with medium body and substantial carbonation that really carries the flavors around the mouth.  D: Very drinkable. Nice flavors, interesting without being odd, and a good balance of satisfying and refreshing.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,veinless,4.21,"Vintage: Bottled in May 2010  Pours a crystal clear deep sap orange, with some of the most whipped, pillowy soft looking lacy head I have ever seen. It almost looks like soft-serve, and is definitely just as inviting. Combination of large and tiny bubbles is gorgeous.  From the nose I get just some green apple/citrus to go with a Brett barnyard scent. A bit of spice, perhaps coriander, comes from the Belgian yeast I believe, which adds to the back end of the aroma.  Taste is oh so light, which is not to be confused with bland, as the beer skips from citrus tones to very subtle belgian spice, in this case coriander plus a little bit of something else, something just a bit peppery. From there it goes to the Brett funk, and gives you nothing but that til the end. All flavors are delicate and would be tough to distinguish if this was my 4th or 5th beer of the night, so have this one when your palate is fresh, and you don't have a cold or anything like that. It really is a very dainty and light footed beer. Tartness could be a little better, but that may have interfered with some of the other flavors, so I trust they know what they are doing over there.  Mouthfeel is dominated by the carbonation, which never seems to stop. This lends it a nice creamy texture, but also does get in the way of enjoying each individual taste, as you kind of have to cut through the foam and bubbles the entire time. It is a very pleasantly weighted beer though. Drinkability is good too, as I wouldn't have known the abv was 6.9% if I didn't check the bottle. Finish is funky, which may be off-putting to some, but I enjoyed restarting the cycle of flavors each time. Very relaxing beer - this is the beer you want while relaxing in front of the TV after work.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Kinsman,4.03,"Poured from a bottle with a bottled on date of July 29, 2009 making this one just over 1.5 years old.  Pours a hazy almost murky looking copper color with some pale orange highlights. A huge rocky and dense looking head builds itself up to almost 4 fingers thick and dissipates just quick enough for my level of impatience.  Aroma is notably citrusy and estery with hints of lemon and a bit flowery too. The yeast profile does however seem to mute this a bit with a slightly musty funk to it.  Whoa, first sip and there seems to be a lot more going on in this beer than the aroma suggested. The lemony citrus is there, but it almost plays second fiddle to musty Brett character. Also there seems to be some spice-like character and even a bit of a grassy/cereal grain malt profile. That being said, this has got to be one of the most complex and subtle Belgians I've come across. Lots of good things going on here but I'm not quite sure the blend together all that well, keeping me from giving anything higher than a 4 for taste.  Mouthfeel is light and even a bit airy. Overall, Orval is a rather unique Trappist ale and one I would like to experiment with at different ages. I have a feeling though that I would enjoy this if it were a bit younger, like 6mos to 1 year instead. Still, not bad at all though and quite a challenge for the palate to comprehend.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Sachsenfreude,4.55,"appearance; hazy orange with no sediment. Light pillowy white head. Excellent retention and chunky lacing.  smell; sour and tart with herbal hops and an apple-like maltyness. Some sweet caramelized sugars. Nectarines and apricots come to mind as well.  taste; upfront a rustic lambic-like tart and sour flavor tries to come through but is too weak to poke through the hop bitterness that soon takes control and carries with a Herbes de Provence-like complexity, to the finish. Some yeasty flavors dance with the alcohol and snuggle the hops into the finish and aftertaste. Very good but from the smell, more tart flavors are to be expected.  mouthfeel; rich and creamy carbonation, slick and smooth finish...a tiny bit chewy.  drinkability; superb and tasty, easy to drink with well blended flavors and smooth alcohol.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,CuriousMonk,3.62,"Poured from bottle into a heavy trappist glass. Orange color, big white head; aroma of sour fruits and floral hops; medium body, smooth, lively carbonation; flavor is also of sour fruits like apples and citrus backed up by some delicate sweet malty tones still never stealing the show, which, by the way, has a pretty dry hoppy finish. Actually, this may not be the most complex of trappist beers, but what it has to offer is in just great balance as you would expect from the brewery making only one beer to public. And mine was still very young so I would be curious to find out what good would a little aging do to this.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Wegomlegging,4.94,"Pours nice orange-gold with an excellent white head that is textbook Belgian lace. It seems no matter how long you stand this beer up, or no matter how quick you pull back on the pour, or no matter how careful you are to watch the neck of the bottle for sediment, a slight amount of cloudiness is present. The smell is just outstanding, with a full nose like a bouquet of flowers that is unlike anything that is brewed in the universe. The flavor follows the same road, with a yeasty flowery flavor that is not the slightest bit cloying, sweet, or skunky. What a great ride down the gullet, with about the perfect amount of carbonation. Since it finishes so dry and complete, it's as drinkable as it gets. What a great, great beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,great7dividers,4.55,"Orval pours a nice hazy golden color with hints of orange. The head is incredibly thick and frothy, and sustains longer than most brews. The aroma from this trappist ale is subtle and citrus-y with a bready undertone (rather yeast-like). The mash of sour and spicy aroma is both impressive and pleasing, without being overpowering. The taste is equally enjoyable being fruity and well balanced. The mouthfeel starts soft and sparkling, then finishes amazingly dry. Orval combines all the best features of belgian-trappist flavors with an immaculate dry finish that makes this ale superbly drinkable.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

The color was a beautiful light brown/caramel, nice and cloudy. It smelled hoppy and full of yeast, a definite sourdough bread. It tasted of spice, grass and hops, with an pleasant even carbonation that made the beer feel like it was a blanket across ,y palate. A mild bitter dry finish. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and will certainly add it to my regular rotation whenever I am able to find it.

Right from the get go with about half of the bottle in the glass this had 4 fingers worth of creamy off white head. Head dissipated quickly leaving a artwork of lacing behind on the glass. Beer poured a slightly hazy amberish orange color.  S: The scent starts off with this weird tartness almost similar to a flemish red (think rodenbach). Lots of citrus going on in the nose - lemon and orange peel along with a great about of spicy funkiness. Pretty big hop character. The belgian yeast is very subtle but there.  T: As one previous reviewer put, this beer has some belgian ""twang"" to it. Got a weird combo of Belgian yeast, some spice and citrusy hopness going on. Pretty complex if you as me. Has a little bit of weird fruit tartness that isn't bad but its just kind of funky.  M: Medium bodied beer with plentiful carbonation that models a Triple. Pretty dang smooth and if you are used to drinking high ABV beers, the alcohol is non-existent here. Beer rolls of the tongue nicely.  D: Drink ability is pretty good on this one.

37,129,Mancer,4.53,"The distinctly Belgian bottle poured (into an Orval glass) out a hazy golden orange body with a one finger high off-white head. The thick foam kept its form and slowly dissipated. Overall the head was thick and clung to the glass. The initial aromas were of belgian yeast, fruits, spices, and malts. The initial flavors of the beer were of barley, yeast, distinct fruity notes (specifically banana), and light spices. The beer was slightly sour and bitter, and had a light to medium body with medium stong carbonation. Aerating the beer in your mouth results in what I call hyper foaming, where the beer in your mouth converts almost immediately to foam.  This is a slow drinking beer in order to appreciate the extremely dynamic flavors found within. Overall, this was really nice and relaxing to drink and made for a nice birthday beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,jrenihan,4.3,"Re-review. Didn't really know what to expect when I first had this beer, and found it surprising and not particularly enjoyable.  Bottled 08/06/2010. I assume that is DD/MM/YY, which makes this one almost 2.5 years old.  The beer has an insane amount of head. An enormous cream-white head sits atop the beer, despite a very slow pour. Beer is caramel in colour. The head recedes at a steady pace, but there is so much of it that it is there for a long time.  Smell is great, and noticeable even as the beer is being poured. The brett really sticks out, likely the result of the time this bottle has had to develop. Funk, lots of light fruits and berries, a bit of a medicinal spicy scent, and some bready malt.  Flavour wise, the beer is very dry. Has a powdery, medicinal flavour to it, which doesn't sound good but it works. The funk is prominent, giving a bit of a barnyard flavour. Cherry and some other fruit flavours. Some sweet malt, but the sweetness is overpowered. Complex. Finish is, again, bone dry.  Medium bodied, moderate to low carbonation. What activity there is is quite subtle, resulting in a beer that is active but not irritating. Dries the mouth somewhat.  Overall, just great. Wow, a real difference between having this now and for the first time almost two years ago, when I had never encountered brett and was expecting a typical Belgian pale. I'm glad I held onto this bottle since then, as I think the age has done it well. Unique among the Trappist beers and very good.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,BarrytheBear,3.46,"Bowling pin bottle dated 22/4/10.  Even a slow deliberate pour yields a nearly three finger chunky fluff atop a clear pale orange pour with sharp yellow highlights. Fizzy carbonation makes itself known from the popping and hissing emitted from the glass. Looks quite appealing.  Initial scent is of sharp tartness. This is quickly overpowered by dusty lemon, some menthol like spiciness, and a healthy dose of funk. I wish the hops and sharp tartness carried more of a star role than that of second fiddle. Eh.  Ditto the smell remarks here. In general, I enjoy sharp acidity over barnyard and I despite the term horse blanket, but can see how it applies here. I want to punch myself for using it however. There....well deserved. The lemon and apple are really cleaved into by the very dry finish, which, in my opinion, inhibits some of the possible stand out flavors. Alot of dust and must. I know this is a cult classic, and it's enjoyable. But it's not a beer that I'd go out of my way to drink on a regular basis. It's got the potential, but falls short for me.  Carbonation is big bubbles and quite high. For the first few post-pour minutes, there a veritable angry swarm of bubbleage than only mildly subsides with time.  Drinkability is fine, but a one-and-done for me, and most likely not a beer I'll seek out again with regularity.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

A - Well I poured about 1/3 of this bottle into my tulip and had to stop... unless I wanted to gulp down Orval head from my carpet. Pours with at least 4 fingers of aggressive head. It slowly dies down, turning into huge crevasses of bubbles. The color is dark orange amber.  S - Well, for a BPA, this certainly doesn't fit many of the characteristics. The smell is almost like wine, very complex. Hints of fruit, quite a bit of hoppiness. Definitely a musty type smell to it, almost like an attic.  T - A bit more muted than I expected from the smell of it. The mustiness is still there, which I don't mind, but the hop character is not nearly as present. The Belgian twang is present, and the alcohol is present as it warms.  M - Similar in part to a tripel, lots of aggressive, large bubbles. I'm shocked there's any carbonation left after the angry head this baby produced.

It slowly recedes in a rocky way then maintains about 1/2 inch and leaves plenty of lacing. Quite the first impression!  S: Apples, pears, peaches, banana/clove, sour and funk.  T: Words are eluding me. I get everything from the nose, the fruit flavors all meld together with the sour and funk to create one complex tasting beer. Malt body is fairly light and has a clean crystal sugar sweetness with a little bit buttered biscuits. The fruit takes on an all-natural awesome mix-fruit sweet tart like taste with lots of clean candy sugar. The funk reminds me of a saison or borderline wild. There's some underlying herbal qualities, almost medicinal, but not in the bad robitussin/advil way. Finish is light and clean. Alcohol is non-existent.  M: Medium carbonation that isn't as fine as champagne. Fairly light body, though it's pretty damn smooth. Right on target for the style.

S: A bit musty, and fairly floral--a rose garden is how I like to describe this beer. A bit of hop bite and a touch of sweetness round it out.  T: Good rounded brett character with some of those same floral notes. Clean candi sugar fermentation in an otherwise fairly dry beer. Orval is one of the best, if you like a balanced brett and flowers--a personal favorite.  M: Well carbonated, clean, light body. Goes down easy.  D: I love Orval.

37,129,garymuchow,4.34,"Another Super Bowl Belgian. Purchased at a good price too at Zipps. Surprised on how sweet the initial aroma is that is then followed by the more traditional yeasty, phenolic with a unique funkiness with this one. This has a rather fresh quality - it was bottled in 4/10. Nice fruit intermixed. Nice. Big full white head. Cloudy brownish amber. Flavor is tamer than the aroma. Resembles the aroma quite a bit. A bit of bitterness up front. Mild malt, yeasty flavor, but lacking the great fruitiness of the aroma. Even though the flavor is not the level of aroma, it's still very fine tasting. Slight stale, oxidized taste. Smooth feel even with full on carbonation. Drinks very easily. No excessive richness. More than one would be not problem.

37,129,Aress,1.69,"I was highly anticipating trying Orval after having tried all the other Trappists (except Westvleterten) and thoroughly enjoying them. The appearance was nice and the foamy thick head looked like laundry detergent. The smell, however, was quite off-putting. I'm all for unique beers but the smell reminded me of walking into a doctor's office. There was a faint smell of grapefruit but I mostly smelled what others have noted - hay, horse blanket, medicinal, and as one other reviewer noted, ""stale urine."". These are not exactly welcoming smells. Just because something has an identifiable smell (like horse blanket) does not mean its pleasurable. The taste was extremely sour and tart, astringent even, and was very dry. This was not a drinkable beer for me. I'm wondering if the high scores on BA are attributable to the reputation and history of Orval. I appreciate good beer, and maybe my palate is just not as evolved as others for a beer like this, but I can't put Orval in the same class as Rochefort or Chimay.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Opens with a very loud hiss. Pours a beautiful amber/orange with an indestructible white head that retains like a champ leaving good lacing as well. Hazy but not much sediment seen. Beers really don't get much better looking.  Brett-effected fruits dominate the smell. Mostly light fruits like lemon, pear and apple but some red grapes as well. Oak and funky barnyard are plentiful as well, this is musty yet bright and fruity at the same time, great balance.  Much like the smell, a superb balance of fruity, funky, sweet, sour. Drinks very much like a lite-lambic or wild ale without the bracing sourness. Lemons, pear, apples, hints of berries throughout. Funky, cheesy barnyard, basement, and big hay/grassiness throughout as well. Bready malts very noticeable, especially in the finish. Some alcohol here and there. Sweet tart/candy sweetness. I start to get a magically delicious vanilla yeasty flavor towards the end of it all.  Mouthfeel is extremely carbonated, but somehow not a bother and strengthens the beer overall in my opinion, it's very light and fluffy. Funk overtakes a bit with warmth.  Amazing, pretty much. Definitely hits its peak once it warms up some. The fact that this isn't in the top 100 with nearly 1,700 reviews is slightly disturbing.

37,129,Smakawhat,4.65,"Poured into what else, an official Orval chalice glass.. and that my friends.. makes a difference. Bottle is one year from date bottled upon tasting.  Let's talk about how this beer looks in this glass. It is flat out exceptional, just amazing. Not sure the ""perfect"" way to pour it in, but if you create a simple two finger head it works. Let's start from the top. This head is one of the most amazing things I have ever seen. Rock solid cap.. nowhere to go, swirl the glass and this thing dances. It's like a giant hockey puck on your glass, yellow off white. There is even some lacing stick on this very tapered glass. The color of this beer through this glass is litteraly multi-colored. From top these honey hues, at top taper it is brown going down to caramel and then gold towards the bottom.. It's almost completely opaque but not quite, you can just.. JUST barely see through it. This glass shows off this beer unlike anything I have ever seen, it looks like a million bucks. Throw some more brown dots of yeast from the bottle on the top of it later too!  Bouquet... WOW. This is unreal, at first a sweet confusing spice, strangely creamy and dry, almost like bananas. In reality it's like sweet-tarts and bottle cap cola candy, this incredible powdery sweetness. On top of that, through in some classic barnyard mustyness. FUNKY!!  Taste is challenging. This is almost like a saison but at least a tolerable one. Quick quinine tonic water tingles and bitterness. Extremely herbal, big pungency bitterness, after a few more tastes the sweetness of candy comes out more often but not totally. Almost but not totally metallic sharp palate slicing feel. Very impressive.  Drinkability for me this is a blast, but I can see others having a lot of trouble with this beer and getting past it.

T: i think i poured this too cold, as the taste definitely improved after i let it sit for a bit. starts slightly tangy (but not as sour as i'd expect from the nose) then strong medicinal/phenols take over, with just a touch of biscuity malt in the background. a quick hit of horse blanket, then finishes extremely bitter, bordering on astringent, and dries up almost entirely. with a touch more sweetness and/or acidity, this would have been great, but as it was the bitterness as the end took away the complexity in the middle for me...  M: love the intense effervescence.  D: this was certainly complex, but the finish was honestly too bitter for me that made me not crave another at all and give pause for going through the glass. not bitter in a citric/pine american IPDA/DIPA way, but this intense medicinal bitterness.  I will try this one out again in a year or two if/once my palate develops more around wild/brett/funky belgian style brews. but for now, while this was certainly a worthwhile taste, at the price it's not something i'll go back to until i think it's something i'd appreciate more...",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Loads of esters and caramel characters with lemon and spice in the background. Some horse blanket with a bite and carbonation really kicks this up a notch.

S: Smells floral, almost like straw up front. Perhaps a bit of alcohol underneath with some banana.  T: Sweet taste up front, Belgian yeasts, some banana. Definitely some hops detected, along with a warming alcohol sensation as you drink.  MF: Dry and light, a lot of carbonation on this one.  D: Extremely drinkable. Really goes down smooth.

37,129,dasenebler,4.68,"33cl, bottled on 8/17/10.  Cloudy, glowing orange-amber. Lots of clingy, thick foam even with a slow pour. Clumpy, craggy head sticks around forever.  Aroma is at first strongly estery, with some pear and banana bread, and then becomes decidedly earthy and Bretty.  What a wonderful beer. So dry, hoppy, bitter and complex. Lots of grapefruit, lemon and orange rind. Biscuity malts and wheaty flavors are there, but with no trace of sweetness. Then there's that wonderfully smooth Orval yeast, combined with an earthy, musty component. The finish is so bitter, dry and refreshing, just like eating a grapefruit. The mouthfeel is actively carbonated and fluffy, perhaps a little too aggressive.  This might be the driest Belgian Pale Ale or Saison (whatever it is!) out there. Nothing else like it.

Subtle nose of straw, interesting yeast and pear.  Taste is dry and complex. Very short hit of Buddhist malt, followed quickly by loads of straw dryness. Gentle apples and pears, some interesting yeasty notes.  Body is medium and helped with good carb levels.  Hugely drinkable.  Not the best Orval I've had. But most of them aren't.

Very nice taste of sweet with low power Belgian yeasts present. Alcohol doesn't seem to come through immediately in the flavor, but is there with a nice warming later on.

This beer pours a murky, dirty dishwater orange-brown colour, with a copious amount of frothy and foamy whipped-cream eggshell white head, which displays excellent retention, eventually giving up some random snow crystal lace around the glass.  It smells of sharp, fairly sour yeast, earthy lemon peel, pale grainy malt, a bit of white sugar, mild clove/coriander spice, and floral, musty hops. The taste is pale grainy malt, more tart, somewhat acetic lemon juice, softly spicy phenols, white pepper, a touch of seemingly dry honey, a twinge of barnyard essence, and edgy floral hops.  The carbonation is moderate after that initial outpouring, maybe a tad prickly at worst, the body medium-light in weight, but still weirdly substantial, and duly smooth. It finishes fairly dry, the yeast picking it up alongside the dry, bitter noble hops.  A nice, lightly sour, and decently complex pale ale, when shed of all that Trappist lore. It hides the extra ABV oh so very well, and it makes me want to order some European appies in the here and now - y'know, pommes frites, or something.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

The pairing is a bison burger on a potato roll with sweet onions and mushrooms with crumbled idaho bleu cheese. It's a solid pairing  It appears redish orange, starts with a huge fluffy head but retains only a film and leaves just a bit of lace on the glass  This beer is very dry, just a bit of malty sweetness, some delightful yeasty mustiness, the yeast also has a sour character to it. This beer has a more perceivable hop finish then most Belgians that I'm used to.  Sufficient carbonation, dry, a bit thin. It cleanses the palate and makes it an excellent companion to greasy food.

Big and fruity, following the yeast and the nose on the front, followed quickly by a sharp bitterness that cuts immediately through the sweetness with an herbaceous note that resembles rosemary and saffron.

37,129,ThePorterSorter,4.11,"Served at a room temperature minus several degrees to a 3 minute chill in the fridge. bottled on 01/06/2010 (a year and 3 days old after bottling)  Appearance: Tremendous carbonation when poured into my Chimay chalice, almost 2 full inches of head before 1/2 the bottle had been poured in. This fact excites me because I know magic went down in the bottle. The beer appeares to be a dull copper with an impenetrable haze. When held to the light there is an cider-like amber haloed by yellow around the edges. There is no visible yeast sediment on the bottom. Giving the beer a chance to settle (aka letting the head fall) leaves lacing and a constant white fluff over the top.  Smell: Incredible depth and complexity. A nail-polish acetone fruitiness from the yeast comes through pundgently with a chlorine-like chemical burn following. I am highly intrigued, but not sure whether the pool water aroma will translate to good or bad in the flavor profile.  Taste: This beer tastes of must and sweet citrus. Elemental, earthy flavors that rely heavily on the yeast for both body and flavor. A grainy malt makes an appearance towards the end of the sip. I am impressed with this beer and its obvious roots deep within Belgian brewing history. I prefer to sip this beer casually because there is a tremendous amount going on.  Mouthfeel: The beer feels rich and flavorful, medium body followed by a dry finish. This beer is sweet yet tart and travels smoothly (no bite) as most of the carbonation was blown off in the initial pour!  Drinkability: The beer is less drinkable compared to other Belgians, ie Chimay or Duvel, but still a treat to enjoy. I am uncertain how colder serving temperatures would affect the beer's drinkability. I would say the overall appearance and flavor profile drive this beer to having a ""good"" drinkability rating, but its pungent chemical aroma would take away from a delicate meal. I have not proven this theory and may be completely wrong; if I every see it on tap I will test the waters. For a relaxing night in, this beer does the trick, although price would keep me from having more than 2.  Cheers.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Pours hazy orange/amber with a gigantic foamy, bubbly, and fluffy off white head that a Duvel tulip couldn't contain. Takes forever to recede and leaves rings of foamy, bubbly lacing and a rocky island behind.  Aroma features the most authentic bubblegum aroma I've encountered, very grassy, floral and herbal, spices, some lemon, a bit of orange, as well as some funk buried underneath. Complex and strong aroma.  Flavor is fruity apples, lemon, orange, pear, bubblegum, some spice, some tartness up front, then a bit of caramel sweetness in the middle transitioning to a touch more spice and an overall dry finish.

37,129,jbphoto88,4,"The first thing to notice is the giant aggressive white head. Full billowing white bubbles that pop and lace the glass as it recedes. The color is hazy orange with muted yellow highlights. A steady stream of bubbles feed the glorious cap.  Nose is very interesting. The yeastiness of your typical Belgian is there as are your bready, spiced and peppery scents. It's interesting because there is a little hay and farm scents lingering in the background and I don't hate that. I never thought I would describe a beer smelling like a farm and like it... weird!  Taste thankfully doesn't retain much of the farm flavors. I'm not going to lie, there is a hint of it, but not much. The real dominating flavor is lightly toasted grains mixed with crisp sour apples and a touch of peppery spices. All work amazingly well together and none really take center stage which is a good thing. This beer is complex yet balanced.  I can see people being confused and put off by this beer. It can't possibly be everyones cup of tea but I sure am enjoying it. The mouthfeel is sharply tart with a fierce dry finish. A fun bubbly, baby champagne like carbonation burns your tounge and just adds to an already pleasurable experience.

Sticky lacing leaves littles patterns like clouds along the insides of the glass  S: Kind of sharp at first - a bit of bitterness (from the hops perhaps?) and a funky barnyard kind of smell; getting peppery notes and a medicinal kind of scent; there is also a faint, sweet floral-like note that comes through occasionally, though its harder to pick up this note amongst the medicinal note and the bit of funk (I think those scents are getting stronger as the beer warms)  T: Very interesting and hard to describe - getting light fruit notes (pear), a touch of citrusy lemon, and alot of grassy flavors; a bit of funk that I really dont know how to describe. Some residual hop like bitterness on the finish that dries out very quickly and leaves a grainy/bready note competing with some peppery flavors.  M: Very fine carbonation - a lot of tingly little bubbles across the palate; lends a nice crispness to this beer  D: 6.9% ABV and this is a treat to drink; alcohol is present but the flavors (the peppery notes and the barnyard funk) meld well to disguise its sting.

As you get over that initial taste explosion, as your tastebuds have been assaulted and surrender - the bitterness starts to come through and the hops and bitterness are pretty much whats dominates in the final half of the glass. Needs a careful pour to reveal the murky dark orange colour. The head is pretty good, but not dense and mine faded very quickly and looked like scungy sea foam on a rocky beach after a while.  Next time I have this I will share it among friends, to enjoy that initial taste explosion and avoid the somewhat disappointing finish to the beer. and at 600yen a bottle in Japan (Us $7) it's a steep drink and probably a good one to split with a friend anyway.  Glad I tried it and definitely a beer you should try at least once.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Citrus, grapefruit and something else I can't point out. Might be the yeast they use.  T: First thing that hits the taste buds is a lot of funk. Unique strand of yeast used in this beer. Grapefruit and other citrus follows. Some tartness and bitterness after.  M: Light bodied with high carbonation makes a frothy texture and a sparkling finish.

I sat here laughing my ass off that such a powerful, complex great beer was in such an unassuming bottle. One of my beer guys at local store said, ""you like Belgian beers and you have NOT tried Orval?!!"" He literally went to the shelf grabbed the beer and said, "" you will thank me."" He was right on, trust me, try this beer!",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,allforbetterbeer,4.38,"Bottled on May 05 2010, bottle opened on December 15 2010. Poured into a snifter.  I poured this beer at fridge temp with the utmost care (remembering that it produces an amazing head) and it still yielded three fingers of head below the rim of my glass, and continued to rise above the rim another two fingers! I had to suck off foam to keep it from spilling down the side of the glass, not once, but twice. Without a doubt the most fantastic head on any beer I have ever seen. Body is a rusty luminescent orange with the slightest cloudiness, which would probably clear if I let this stand for a week or so (this bottle was kept undisturbed for 24 hours before opening). I can't see how this beer could be better, and it earns the first '5' I have ever awarded for appearance for any beer.  It is hard to fully smell this beer because the head is rising out of the glass. What I do smell is interesting and refined. Candy-fruits; granny smith apple, peach, and apricot. The slightest near-funk ""barnyard"" or old cheese, and cider. A little swirling uncovers slight malts and some English hops.  The flavor is intricate, and unlike anything I have tasted. The aged hops lend a mellow and subtle hop bitterness that is paired with complex malts. All this is underneath the flavors that I am guessing are produced by a variety of bacteria and yeast. Cider is very prominent, as is a slight funk and some horseblanket and fresh apples. As I get into the glass, more bitterness shows up and the hops become more assertive. The malts seem to strengthen as well. The aftertaste is a cross section of the entire flavor profile, and it lasts and lasts.  Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium, and has the thin character that some aged beers can have (although this bottle is only 7 months old). Carbonation feels authentic. Drinkability is wonderful, but the flavors are so complex I can't imagine drinking this fast.  Conclusion: This is one of the most complex liquids I have ever smelled or tasted, and certainly one of my favorite beers of all time. Orval takes the meaning of beer to a new level in its own way. Everything about this beer is interesting, including the bottle, which seems to fit the beer perfectly. I wouldn't be surprised if this beer's taste differs significantly between vintages because there are so many flavors that lead me to believe that this beer has a number of microorganisms that contributed to its fermentation. Drinking this ale reminds me why I love beer in the first place- no wine ever tastes this intriguing to me.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,marchoftheclouds,1.88,"When I pay $4.99 for a 11.2 oz ""treat"" I expect the trifecta of different, unusual and really exceptional (as in tasty). I'm finding I can't always get the trifecta ... and it's probably due to my preferences. After drinking the Orval, I read an A+ review by Jason Alström. I read other reviews, too, and noticed one beer advocate thought he got a bad bottle. That was the first thought I had after my first mouthful. I don't like beer that has a grapefruit taste in it. I've tried extremely hoppy beers, but they aren't my thing. I think I'll keep trying new things, but I'm leaning more and more to, ""If you can see through it, you might not like it!""",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,mynie,4.83,"Resplendent pour, like a honeycomb peacock. Or like Duvel, only thicker, manlier, less like champagne and more like beer, expect for it's just as fancy and just as beautiful.  The aroma is lightly sour but still dry and spicy, sort of like a saison only without the crisp summeryness.  Tastes like a whole new kind of good. It's aggressively fizzy, unlike most other trappists, and so it hits you more like beer than like wine. And I mean that in the most non-judgmental way possible, just as a simple observation: if you sat one of these and a Westy 12 in front of a guy who's only drank Bud, he'd say this is more beery.  The complexities are big Brett, mild ripe fruit, and some dry European hops. It all very dry and yet very sharp, and most of all it tastes like it's alive. This isn't like anything else I've ever had before. The feeling is like when you visit a new, majestic physical place--and maybe you've seen pictures of it before, or maybe you heard about it, but that's nothing like *being* there*, and the newness of it all makes every little part of it seem especially vibrant.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Smell: Lots of lemon, backed up by yeast and some floral notes. A very, very inviting aroma overall.  Taste: Begins with a slight citrus peel bitterness and lemon zest, middling out to apple and herbs, finishing with a very nice hop profile backed up by some musty Belgian yeast.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with well-rounded natural carbonation and a dry finish.

37,129,albern,4.18,"I can't believe I've never reviewed this beer. Well it certainly looks the part with a thick, billowing, frothy head that retains about as well as any beer you'll find. The lacing is thick and pasted around the rim of the glass. The beer is orangy and cloudy with a some tiny particulates noticeable. The nose is Belgian sweet malts, candied sugars, coriander, florals, and the herbal yeastiness that you come to expect with the style.  The taste is a tad sharp and I've always felt this way about Orval. It has all the usual suspects for the style, coriander, clove, star anise, but it also has a very sharp orange rind tartness to it that I believe detracts somewhat. The beer is a touch smoother than what is typical for the style, and it benefits by not having that yeasted up prickly mouth feel and coarseness. For a Belgian, this one is pretty smooth. The aftertaste has a bit of the lingering orange rind tartness, but for the most part the remains are mild. This is a refreshing beer too, substantial without being full bodied, a bit of ABV without being boozy. There is a lot to like in an Orval. It's not my favorite Belgian, and not even my favorite Trappist Belgian, but it is a fine beer nonetheless.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,mfreire212,3.06,"I saw just a few of these unique bottles at the local Total Wine and decided to plunk down the six bucks to finally try one (I have been tempted in the past, but struggled to justify that much cash for approximately twelve ounces of an unknown quantity). What the hell, it is the holiday season, right?  I poured the ""trappist ale"" into an Ommegang chalice and immediately noticed a nice sized, pillowy head, covering the burnt orange beverage below (a very respectable start).  From there, everything else was just... average. I am not sure if my inflated hopes for this beer contributed to the let down, or perhaps the price for a single bottle left me wanting a bit more.  The aroma and taste were slighty tart and the oveall taste was pretty dry. I picked up mainly lemony notes. The BPA style is different (more subdued) then ""our"" pale ales, so I was prepared for a less intense experience, but still...  The mouthfeel was very dry and the aftertaste was acidic, and thin. The overall drinkability was average, for lack of a better term. If you gave me another one, then fine....I would drink it (I actually tried and prefer the Ommegang BPA to this one).  But, for the price and the hype, I was a bit disappointed and I am now indifferent to this offering.

37,129,argock,3.71,"Poured from 11.2oz svelte brown bottle into a Chimay goblet. Bottled on 4/22/10 on bottle neck label. Purchased at WIne Warehouse (Charlottesville, VA) for $4.99.  A: Slightly murky amber with big-bubbled white 2-finger head even with a slow pour with good foamy retention and a coating of lace down the glass. Exquisite.  S: Strong aromas of phenolic medicine, bandaid and mustiness are up front, but more herbal, lemongras hoppiness and ever so subtle pale malt sweetness holds this aroma together with wonderful complexity.  T: The tartness is abrupt and unique and works pretty well, but the phenolic medicine component is over the top to my buds. There is a strong lemon citrus, herbal aspect that is slightly puckering along with the dryness of the tart, wild Brett flavors. I usually am pretty turned off by Brett character, but in this one-of-a-kind brew, it works pretty well with the lemongrass and pale malt crispness that is most apparent in the finish/aftertaste. If the phenols were toned down somehow, I would really dig this brew a lot more.  M: Too heavily carbonated to my taste as I like a more layer, thicker feel, but I think that's the brewers' point to some degree to try to work well with the dryness. It give is a saison-like crisp feel in the finish.  D: A truly unique beer that I'm glad I tried but probably won't pick up too often as I like a bit more sweetness and a more slick, coating feel to Belgian Pale Ales (more akin to Duvel).",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

I digress ...  Bottled on 5/19/2010, best by 5/19/2015  L: Apricot-hay colored, but the more dramatic portion of the look is the absurd amount of head.

Starts strong with a big front of brett-induced sour, transitions smoothly into a fading lingering sweetness that tails off into nothingness.  T: Brett character is not nearly as pronounced as in the nose, and it's in the back, not the front. Mostly this beer is a subdued dry sweetness. Really quite good, if entirely unexpected from the nose. Smooth into a sweet, then dry middle, then the brett kicks in to compliment with a subtle sourness in the finish. Based on the nose, and on American brews using brett, I expected this to be far more brett-heavy, but in fact the brett is really more an embellishment than the centerpiece.

The taste is, wow, much more hop-centric than expected. While I wouldn't necessarily call this a bitter beer by any stretch, it has alot more hop character than most other Belgian pales I've tried to date. The light sweet fruitiness (apple, grape, etc.?) is beautifully balanced by a pronounced grassy, floral hoppiness that provides a crisp and dry finish that leaves just a slightest apple/bubblegum taste coating the mouth, yearning for more.  Medium to light bodied, vigorous carbonation, maybe slightly overcarbonated, but to be expected for the style.  Hides its ABV very well, would gladly session a few of these on any evening, until of course I get knocked off my chair due to the 6.9% ABV.

37,129,stakem,4.17,"A ~7 month old bottle poured into a goblet. This brew appears a lightly hazy copper color with a monstrous amount of slightly yellowish off-white head that is 4+ fingers thick and composed of large bubbles. The cap slowly fades back to a finger's worth of thick froth leaving an abundant amount of lace clinging to the glass. Carbonation endlessly erupts out of this brew from some etching on the bottom of the glass supporting the head.  The aroma of this brew is seriously all over the place. Right when the cap was removed, it smelled of fruity hops and light amounts of citrus hops. As it gets poured, it opens up in the glass and starts to showcase sour indications that are reminiscent of lacto and some very light brett'd character fills the back of the nose. A light indication of plastic is noted. Throughout the middle are lemony scents present as well as some other light fruitiness like pear, orange and more lemon. My overall feeling of this brew is that it smells somewhat medicinal and like a solvent type of house cleaner.  The taste of this brew upfront is lightly fruity with a taste somewhat similar to apple and pear skins. Through the body are the sour indications of lacto and brett notes that are drying. It has a light funk quality about it that suggests barnyard without actually going there. It is earthy and somewhat herbal without going right into the typical wet leather brett character. It finishes mostly dry with a long lingering bitter herbal hoppiness mixed with notes of plastic. There is significantly more bitter herbal hop character in the finish of this brew that I would have ever guessed based on the smell and initial taste.  This is a light bodied brew with a bursting amount of carbonation that is both visual and prickly on the tongue. It gets more enjoyable as it sits and is swirled calming the carbonation level down to an acceptable level. I dont have all that much experience with drinking this brew a lot, but I could forsee this brew being something that could be aged and really develop into something completely different from this relatively ""young"" offering. With a best by year of 2015, I wouldn't mind securing a few more bottles of this and start trying to push that best by dating to see what older bottles are like.

Took two pours to get it fully in the glass. Very foamy head that lingers and sticks to the sides of the goblet as you drink.  Aroma is pleasing and not too pungent. A spicy aroama with a noticeable smell of coriander and orange peel.  Taste follows the aroma with the ""brett"" yeast producing a nice complex flavor. Slightly sour and funky with a citrusy and slightly hoppy backbone.  Mouthfeel is where this one excels for me. Very, very smooth and easy to drink. Unique offering that far exceeds its copies in my opinion.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,klikger,4.5,"Bottle poured into a Westvleteren chalice  A - Golden-amber and very cloudy - looks like apple cider; huge white head & great lacing  S - Brettanomyces, lemon & raspberry essences, robust fresh malts  T - Pungent wild yeast and floral hops --&gt; fresh grains - wheat and rye?, earthy hops --&gt; lemon peel --&gt; finishes bitter and sour, yet still malty  M - Medium-bodied, excellent carbonation, great to swish back and forth due to complexity of flavors  D - Very drinkable for the style - I want more as soon as the bottle is gone, every time  D -  Overall, this is a fantastic beer - funky, yet amazingly well-balanced and super drinkable.

37,129,nhindian,4.02,"An interesting beer as it is only one of 7 Trappist beers in the world, and the only one to purposely use Brett to sour the beer.  A - The beer itself comes in a wide, unique bottle with the label strewn around the neck. Pours a light, goldenrod color with a deep amber middle. Builds a beautiful 3-fingered head that last for ages, and what doesn't stick around forms a nice, foamy cap. Intermittent lacing the glass.  S - The Brett really adds a ton of funk to this beer. The nose is all sour, barnyard, grassy funk with just a hint of the traditional Belgian yeast qualities. Fruity and spicy, this beer really mixes the senses keeps the nose guessing. Smells light and refreshing.  T - Taste is fruity, floral, and sour. The tart fruits shock the mouth, but the spice and orange bitterness cleanse the mouth and overall its moderately dry. Heavily flavored in a lemon, grass, herbal context and overall it has a pretty dense flavor profile. Unique and complex.  M - Mouthfeel is medium to heavy bodied and ample carbonation. Lots of tiny bubbles rise to the surface to replenish the head and you can really feel it in the mouth.  D - Drinkability is moderate. The taste is light, dry, and crisp, with a relatively low ABV, but I can see the sour and fruitiness keeping this one from being night-long drink.  Overall I'm a bit torn on this one. I really appreciate the uniqueness of this, but I expected a bit more from a Trappist ale. It's not as complex as some of the darker Trappists, and if given at a blind tasting, I'd probably assume this to be an American take on the Wild style. I'm glad to have tried it but not sure if I'd seek it out in the future.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Swedes21,4.38,"Special thanks to spinrsx on this 50th beer for getting me hooked on craft beers and BA!  Served in a chilled glass..  Appearance - The beer pours with a tremendous amount of head, over 3/4 of my glass. The beer is a gorgeous pale golden and a decent amount of carbonation is present. The head is a foamy white with some decent lacing. Looks amazing!  Smell - First smell is a grassy base, kind of earthy with some citrus base. The hops are present and delightful.  Taste - very unique taste, the beer taste as it smells, true to its form. I can taste like an orange peel citrus upfront followed by the grassy earth tones. Some decent spice taste as well added to the end. The bitterness is almost none.  Mouthfeel - There is a good amount of carbonation added that i found brought the hops fwd. The beer has a little bit more after taste, from the spices during the mouthfeel. As the carbonation is added, the beer maintains a light mouthfeel, not too creamy.  Drinkability - This is a beer i have had for awhile and wanted to give it a special spot. It is well deserving of the 50th spot in my beer adventures. I will want to stock this beer and share with friends. Such a good beer!",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Tastes citrusy and very crisp but what I'm really noticing is that great brett flavor that trails. Mouthfeel is pretty light and smooth.  This is a lot different from other trappist ales I've tried. Others were all very malty but this is much smoother, crisp and I love the brett flavor. Definitely worth a try.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Still waiting on my orval goblet. Huge off white bubbly head formed almost overflowing the glass, as I let it sit it stuck to the glass and fell slowly on the sides leaving a large head in the middle, almost like a an egg. Dark orangey brown color. Very spicy aroma. Tastes exceptional, I detect some orange. Tart and dry. Not as strong as the smell might indicate. I've been told the beer should be at its peak right now, it tastes like it could use a little more time to mellow to me. Very light on the tongue but I can feel it starting to kick in. I wouldn't be able to drink too many of these, it is more of a treat or an after dinner drink.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,nataku00,4.18,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip. A hazy brownish orange beer with a big initial three finger head. Head is mostly small bubbles and khaki colored that laces lightly as the head recedes.  Nose is slightly hoppy with a bit of dried citrus peel and spice. A little sweetness from malt as well.  Taste is really interesting. Bitter citrusy hops upfront, with a little bit of the spice (coriander primarily) midtongue. A bit of lingering bitterness on the tongue.  Plenty of good carbonation in the mouth to help make it roughly medium bodied. Lots of aroma release as well when you hold it in your mouth.

Very complex and I'm sure I'm not doing the description justice. Big carbonation level. I'm glad the Control Board in Ontario finally got this back. I already bought 6 because it was all I could carry. I hope more is at the store in the next couple days when I go back.,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,dacull,4.71,"My first review on here, and as luck would have it I picked a very good beer to start off with.  Poured from bottle into a large wine glass. Honey-like orange color with a thick and persistent white head that left lots of dense lacing all the way up the glass..  Smell is sweet with some fruity notes of citrus and peach and hints of spice.  Taste is sweet, fruity peach up front quickly followed by pronounced flavors of spices, corriander and nutmeg. Slight pine or juniper hint in the aftertaste, along with a persistent corriander-like spice. Several waves of complex flavors over the course of a sip.  Mouthfeel is good, perhapse a bit too much carbonation for my taste, but certainly not unreasonable or out of range for the style.  Very drinkable, I could definitely enjoy one or two more of these in a sitting. Overall an exceptionally well crafted beer and possibly my favorite Belgian pale ale to date. I'll definitely be drinking it again.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Bottled on 22/04/2010, best before 22/04/2015.  a - Pours a murky yellow amber color with two fingers of fluffy white head and moderate to high carbonation evident. Great retention and lacing.  s - Smells of lemon/citrus, floral notes, yeast, brett, and some alcohol. Some sour fruit as well.  t - Tastes of lemon, citrus, floral hops, smooth malts, and very light brett. No where near as funky as the smell.  m - Medium body and low to moderate carbonation. Very smooth and creamy, and easy to drink.  d - I thought this was a pretty good pale ale that was very easy to drink.

37,129,Trapiste389,4.1,"Orval is the real king of beers. Nothing in the world even comes close.  Appearance: A monstrous, rocky and vigorous head full of lace sits atop a beautiful pale straw beer.  Smell: Immediately a powerful hop aroma forces it's way into your nostrils. There is very little malt, just enough for you to know it's there.  Taste: In a word: epic! Like the aroma there is very little malt flavor and you are instantly confronted with the powerful flavor brought on by dry hoping. Very dry, with an extremely pleasant herbal aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Rich and satisfying but not so heavy that it knocks your head back. An excellent medium bodied ale.  Drinkability: Here lies the only problem: you cannot drink this beer all the time. It is powerful and moody and is not a weak beer, so be careful.  As far as I am concerned this the ultimate beer experience, it is a pale ale that is both crisp and moody. as I said before there is no beverage an earth like it.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

The aftertaste is quite tart and clinging. Mouthfeel is smooth, massively high carbonation from the bottle conditioning. Drinkability is good. I was quite pleased with this beer. I had not had it in a LONG time, and never properly reviewed it.

37,129,cleolicious,4.6,"Appearance: A mustard colored and cloudy appearance with a enormous bright white head.  Smell: Tangerine, Lemon, floral. Not too potent but a light hint of each.  Taste: A classic belgian pale Ale taste but filled with orange and lemon. Crisp at first sip then very smooth thereafter. A tad bit art an a hint of cider. Very dry. To be honest, the taste is so complex that I'm certain everyone who reviews it will miss something. I know this beer is ancient and it tastes it.  This is a slow sipping beer, not as up beat as some the Belgians. It's pale ale with a dark and mysterious mood, if that makes sense. I think this beer would be best enjoy once you've sampled many other brands first.

37,129,haazer,4.27,"Poured into my Tulip glass. Bottled on 22/4/10, about 6 months ago, which I heard is the best time for Orval.  A- Offwhite, tan head. Big bubbles throughout. Leaves a little bit of lacing on sides of glass. Head explodes up the glass as you pour. Probably shouldn't have chose a Tulip. Head eventually settles onto a orange, tea colored brew. Cloudy, hard to see through.  S- Very different smell to this beer. Not used to it, but I'm guessing that might be the brett? Has an outdoor, inside of a barn type smell, with hay. Underneath that character is some fruits, and hints of yeast.  T- Sweet, kind of reminds me of an orange or tangerine jolly rancher candy. Aftertaste becomes sweet, and then sour. A taste that I can't define at all, I guess would be the brett.  M- Incredibly smooth. Tangy. This beer kind of leaves a funny feeling in the back of my throat, not uncomfortable though.  D- Good mouthfeel, very smooth brew, can't really taste the alcohol. I let this beer warm a little, but I think its actually better colder IMO.

Aroma dominated by peppery spice with soft notes of lemon, banana, and slight funk.  Moderate carbonation and a light, very dry mouthfeel. Citrus and floral notes up front followed by juniper, slight honey sweetness, mild biscuit malt, and a subtle sourness on the finish.  Subtle, balanced, and refreshing. Bought a couple extra for the cellar and am anxious to see what a couple years will bring.  Update: previous review was for an Orval bottled 4/09/09. Just sampled another from 4/29/09 -- with around 18 months on it, the honey faded to almost nothing and the peppery and spicy notes emerged even more. The pucker on the finish wasn't exactly stronger; it was mostly the impression of dryness that increased.

37,129,brewerburgundy,4.26,"11.2oz bottle, New Belgium glass, bottled on 3/25/10.  Wow! I've viewed this beer as a bit of a challenge since it is the only brett beer available to me where I now spend most of my time. This stuff is gorgeous, absolute amber. The head pretty much exploded on the pour into a yellowed mountain of meringue. It really is that thick.  Easter smells. I couldn't have told anybody what Easter smells like if they'd asked, but Easter egg hunt in a fragrant garden sums it up well. Massive floral, lemon, juniper, other green plant matter, and pastel peach. Now I'm finding what I've seen described that brett ""bandaid"" and ghosts of moderately thick crackers.  This beer is tightly focused around a few flavors that are easily detectable and branches out subtly but expansively. Those core flavors are lemon, juniper, and floral, all dry. Many of those aspects are flora and fauna. A heavy bitterness comes late, as does a sourness. There's even some biscuit malt.  If this New Belgium glass's laser etching didn't knock all the bubbles out of beer quickly this would have an active, spritzing carbonation. The body is moderate and dry.  I have been more than pleasantly surprised, I have been wowed by this beer. Now I'm not in awe, I've gained a respect for trappist beer. I'm slowly going down that Belgian road.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Yeast is fairly noticeable on the palate, with a variety of light fruits and botanicals coming in mid-sip. A gentle, dry hop and citrus peel finish sits lightly but resiliently on the tongue.  This is one of those beers that exudes a relaxed confidence in its status as a world-class brew.

37,129,mothman,4,"Poured into snifter. Pours a finger of white head. Fades down but then has a decent retention. Color is a hazed golden amber.  Aroma: Floral hops with some herbal notes. Lemon zest and brett shows. A barnyard funk is present. A little bit medicinal.  Taste: Brett funkiness is up front. Hay, lemon zest, citrus, herbal flavors, and floral hops. A fairly large floral profile. A bit amount of brett with light oak.  Mouthfeel: Fizzy and smooth. Lighter bodied with a medium amount of carbonation. Ends dry and funky.  Overall, a decent beer. It is fairly bretty which makes it a bit harder to drink, but the light body makes up for that. I could drink this again. 3.75 ___ Having a 22/08/19 bottle 10/19 I seem to enjoy orval more.

Settles into a chunky head like a marshmallow dissolving into a sea of Fluff. Beautiful amber color. Delicate lace nestled down my glass. This is a pin-up girl of beers.  Smells strongly of botanicals, like Herbal Essences shampoo. I think I can pick out juniper and maybe even dome fuzzy hops? Sweet apricot and peach fuzz offsets dry, champagne-like graininess.  Taste is more juniper led botanicals and dry ginger ale and dried apricoty fruit. High carbonation boosts body but could be toned down a bit. Dry finishes cleanses the palette after each sip.

Bubbles kept rising from the bottom to the head. Aroma was pleasant with faint hops that mesh with clove and tart citrus. Palate was wonderful, just enough thickness and carbonation for the realization of it being a beer, but smooth enough to go down easily.

Taste: confirms the aroma with sweet malts, spices, herbal hops, citrus, honey and sweet alcohol presence. Mouthfeel: smooth, low carbonation, warming high alcoholic strength, and full body Finish: goes on forever. Starts dominated by its bitter side and slowly shows its spicy character.

Slight lacing, but not really sticking to the glass. Subsequent pours just stir it right back up. Great legs.  S - Well, this is a really pleasant surprise. While I was expecting a typical trappist pale, this has all of the aromas of an American wild ale. Citrusy, funky notes from the brett, plus some yeastiness in the background. Maybe a little clove and spice. This is just fantastic.  T - A lot going on here -- funkiness at first, less citrus than the nose, plenty of spice: clove and anise, with maybe some allspice. A bit of banana. Little to no alcohol in the finish, although it is somewhat dry.  M - Full and sticky. Just the way I'd like a wild ale to be.  D - This is a really unexpected treat. There's a great combination of a wild and belgian flavors here. Lowish alcohol for a belgian just makes it even more drinkable.

37,129,axeman9182,4.29,"11.2oz bottle, ""bottled on"" date of 30/12/2009, poured into my Duvel tulip.  Orval pours somewhere betwwen a murky gold and a hazy orange, depending on the lighting and the amount left in the glass. One of the best heads I've ever seen on a beer rises up, 4+ fingers of a frothy, rocky white crown. Crazy head retention, and the side of the glass I'm not drinking from has gobs of lacing on it. Possibly the easiest five I've awarded. I guess this bottle is old enough for the brett to really begin asserting itself, this Orval smells like 100% brett funk. Lots of musty leather and horse blanket. It's good, but it leaves the nose to be fairly one dimensional. The flavor is a bit more diverse, and really works well. There's a brief flash of pale apple sweetness, before the realization of how bone dry the beer is and the brett crashes the party. That distinct funkiness occupies the middle of Orval, and makes up a good chunk of the flavor. Right at the end though a brisk shot of bitterness serves as an entrance cue for a subtle lemongrass finish. All in all Orval comes together spectacularly, and I much prefer this to my other experience with Orval, which was a younger, less brett-y, and in my opinion less interesting beer. As one might expect for a beer so dry on the palate, the lack or residual sugars result in a very light (but not watery) beer. Orval is highly carbonated to give the beer a certain sharpness to it, but doesn't cross the line into fizzy, a nice balancing act by the brewers. Orval is just a solid beer all around, and drinks like it's a 4.5% brew rather than nearly a 7% one. My first bottle of Orval put me off a little bit, but this one has redeemed it and more, a fantastic beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

S- First thing that hits my nose is a sour, tart note almost reminding me of cherries, then this gives way to the brett laced funkiness, also a bit of malt too. T- The palate is darn close to the nose, sour tartness up front, with a medium sweetness, then those wonderful brett notes linger in the finish, which is off-dry. M- Medium to light, with a nice crisp effervesnce, a good level of carb. as well. D- I truley understand why this is world class ale, each sip begged for another, then i wondered why i didnt buy two.

The lace that is left is in large amounts. S: The pronounced aroma of a yeasty bubblegum. The medium intensity is a nice, not overpowering aroma, that also lends new aroma characters as the brew warms of subtle spices. T/M: The front is a smooth, burst of carbonation that fills the mouth with beer. These flavors are all balanced between hops and malts. The body of the mouthfeel is a silky sensation that tends to dry out as it finishes. The overall tastes of spices and pale hoppy characters are very well played. D: I would say that this is a exceptionally drinkable beer, all around great flavors, spot on for the style and still goes down easy with the amount of ABV.

T/M-Orval comes about as close to perfection as you can get. Complex earthy flavors, reminiscent of a rainy day in autumn.The brettanomyces is used with subtlety and elegance, and contributes a slick, lingering finish, in addition to its earthy qualities. Subtle grassy hops add some structure, and dry out some of the funk. The body is light and soft, with delicate carbonation.

S - Lemon zest, sweet malt and a bit of sour ""funk"" from the Brett.  T - Notes of green apple, lemon and pear with a solid hop bitterness in the finish, all wrapped up in more ""funk"". There's so much going on in this, the Brett adds such complexity.  M - Medium bodied with a crisp, sharp carbonation. Incredibly dry finish, the palate is scrubbed clean after every sip.

37,129,Gosox8787,4.5,"Presentation: Signature 12. oz bottle poured into a snifter glass. Bottled 4/22/2010. This is my first experience with this beer, so I'm not sure what to expect.  Appearance: Ridiculous, big head on first pour. Takes a while for it to settle down and for me to pour the entire bottle. Autumn bronw in color and rather hazy. No sediment floating around the glass.  Aroma: Citrus zest, green apple tartness, and barnyard funk all come to mind. Also some peach and cherries come through a little. Very aromatic and complex.  Taste: A strong hop presence upfront, some grapefruit and orange notes. Some green apple and funk accompany and counter the bitterness well. Clean fruity finish, very refreshing.  Mouthfeel: Heavy carbonation and light body. Works well with all the crisp flavors.  Drinkability: The ABV never interferes and this drinks really easy. I could definitely have more than a couple of these.  Overall, a really complex and refreshing trappist ale. There is so much going on here, but the assertive hop presense paired with the fruit and funk is great. Highly recommended.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Now, I can say I am definitely a fan!",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Snamnoum,4.11,"Appearance - gorgeous hazy nut brown with FOUR!!! fingers of outrageously thick off white head. Incredible retention and the most sticky lace I have ever seen.  Smell - light hop profile, doughy yeast, pale malt, aggressive phenols  Taste - surprisingly strong hop presence, very IPA-like, sweet malt, champagne esque like tartness, strong bitter finish. Water tasted a bit heavy, a little tinny  Mouthfeel - light/medium bodied, very effervescent, thin feeling  Drinkability - very light and drinkable, one could easily have several of these. I would have liked to have had more of a malt presence and some more yeast as well.

37,129,twelvsies,4.65,"Orval, an all-time classic. It's been a fav of mine for quite a while, but in the constant search for new flavors I've overlooked it a bit recently. I just put a few of these in the cellar to try once a year to see how the brett develops, so I surely need to try one fresh (bottled 04/22/10).  As remembered, an absurd pour. Beautiful caramel color with a nice clarity. Poured carefully into a large wine glass, the head towers above the lip of the glass into a mountainy cone. Excellent retention and lace. Pretty much hits on all marks for appearance. Aroma is balanced, complex and simple all at once. Lightly grassy and hoppy up front with a nice bread and honey maltyness and light peppery notes, all wrapped up in a bit of funk. Taste again is simple, but deep. Nice base of pale malt and a slight sweetness, akin to a good tripel, topped by a grassy hop profile and a nice dry, dusty, peppery finish. The thing that takes this beer to the next level is the mild dose of brett, that slightest funky bite that sneaks up providing an array of oddball flavors. Pretty spectacular. Nice melding of a soft trappist feel and also a hoppy, funky, quirky ale with a prickly texture. A real treat to drink, anytime. I can't wait to see what happens to this beer in a year, or two, or three...",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,penguinjive7,4.53,"The pour is a light amber with a huge foamy head that dissapates along the sides of the glass but remains in the center for the duration.  The initial smell is that of fruity and floral hops with a hint of Belgian yeast sweet fruit.  As the brew toused the tongue there is a pleasant bite from the hops that is particularly strong for a Belgian ale. This fades quickly to a the tangy flavor of young fruit. There is a bit of barnyard presence in the finish that does not overpower the other flovors, but rather ties them together.  The feel in the mouth is of the sharp carbonation of champaign, which makes for easy drinking.  This is a brew with many levels. It is easy drinking, but you have to take your time and enjoy each sip to appreciate everything that is going on. Another fantastic trappist brew.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,RickS95,3.8,"It's a dark amber color, slightly cloudy, sitting under the most amazing head. The head never really goes away. It dissipates slightly around the glass, but not so much in the middle, leaving lacing all over.  Smells like a combination of cherries and champagne. You can almost smell the carbonation.  There's a slight cherry taste. It's almost an earthy taste, but again, champagne is what comes to mind.  It's extremely carbonated and the bite is sharp, almost astrigent-like. While it starts off sweet, there is a bitterness in the finish. Extremely refreshing wiping the palate clean with each sip.  Despite high alcohol and lots of astringent bite, it's actually pretty easy to drink. It's a quality beer and you won't want to stop with just one.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Opens with a surprisingly loud ""psst"", and then this pours with a crazy amount of thick, light brown sticky head, over three fingers pillow up over the top of the rim. Color is slightly hazy wheat/amber color that's quite pleasant, slowly huge craters form on the top and within the lacing. Nose is very Belgian, but somewhat unique, it's got that Belgian yeast nose with a bit of tart funkiness from the bret. It's also a bit sweet and sharp.  Very surprising. It's quite tart and sharp with a nice amount of barnyard funk that sticks around. It's got a very interesting mouthfeel, it's a bit thin/watery but the carbonation is so huge that it makes up for it - never had anything quite like this before. Overall it's quite easy drinking but given the funk it's a slow sipper.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,radioscooter,2.91,"Years ago, I was ushered into the Belgian crowd by the selection at the Sharp Edge here in Pittsburgh, run by a true Belgian Beer cheerleader. At the time, I made the rounds of Trappist selections and wound around them, listening to what the experts said and taking it all in.  I landed upon what is still my favorite style: Strong, Dark and Sweet with a lot of flavor. I still favor a Scotch Ale, Barleywine or Wee heavy above any of the light, bubbly, frothy coriander stuff.  I couldn't remember trying Orval then and I have been going back through the catalogs trying to do my due diligence to the style. I knew it wasn't going to be as strong and musky as the Draak, but I figured it would at least be on a similar par with Chimay, which is still one of my go to drinkable favorites and not a sweet dark.  I think maybe this is an ale that really needs some food to be paired with it. I really didn't enjoy it at all. Out of the bottle it had a massive foam and its carbonation stayed too high for my tastes.  The flavor starts out okay, with light fruit and a zesty tinge, but then some taste that I have yet to hear described accurately that I usually attribute to a ""preservative"" taste when I experience it in countless American microbrews, but am mystified to find it here.  As it warms it does not get any better. Remember I like sweeter brews. This one is just too lackluster and bland for me to value above a food beverage.  Any of the Chimays just kill it, IMO.  An accessory, not a star.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,drizzam,4.12,"A - Poured a cloudy orange/amber in color. A fairly aggressive pour yielded a monster three finger white foamy head. Good head retention with moderate lacing.  S - This is a seriously aromatic brew! As soon as I cracked open the bottle, my living room was flooded with fruity odors...seems like predominantly pear. Also a very dominant spice aroma to go with the pear. This beer almost smells like a champagne to me.  T & M - Tastes mainly like a ripe pear with a peppery finish. There is an earthy hop presence that seems to peek in and say ""Hi"", but it is just a ghost and seems to disappear just as quickly as it appeared. There is a strange complexity at work here. Mouthfeel is on the thin side and it finishes pretty crisp...just a bit of that pepper for an aftertaste.  D - This is certainly a fine brew, but the drinkability is hampered by the cost. I'm not one that could quaff this all night even if cost was not a factor, as the spiciness would prohibit it. Certainly worth a try...this is a perfect example of the style.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

It is so bubbly right now that it's hard to pick up on much of the flavor of the beer. It's very smooth and almost creamy tasting and still has a bit of the red-wine flavor to it, possibly some tannins.

I felt like every sip I was tasting something different. Initial taste is sweet, then bitter, but then a slightly sweet finish. Notes of yeast, sweet fruit, tart fruit, spice, and hops. Slight taste of bread and malt.  Smooth feel, good carbonation level, but leaves the palate a bit too dry.

37,129,RRoeb1123,4.63,"Tried this beer with one of my friends, who is also my partner in crime in tasting beers.  Appearance: Absolutely beautiful, cloudy amber-yellow, with a very nice head that is almost fluffy, that stays for a LONG time. Leaves wonderful lacing on the glass as you enjoy it too. There is also some nice visible carbonation.  Smell: Heavenly to say the least. There are distinctive aromas that I picked up, which was a very earthy smell, which I really liked. There was also a gentle scent of lemon, spice, and clove, along with apples, and almost a peachy scent. Very very inviting to the nose, and makes you just want to bury your nose in the beer.  Taste: Absolutely great, the scents merely hint what underlies this awesome beer, the flavors come at you in a way that you know they are there, but they don't shout at you. Lemon peel, cloves, apples, and even an earthiness taste, that this yeast imparts is absolutely astonishing. The finish is nice and dry, which makes you long for another sip. As the beer warms, it imparts more of a spiciness, which is very pleasant.  The mouthfeel of this beer is great, because of the carbonation. There is a bit of carbonation, which is perfect because it allows the beer to really hang on your palate, but not allowing it to become too heavy on you.  Drinkability: I find this to be a very enjoyable beer, and I would absolutely drink this again. The complexity within the beer on other tastings may be different, and I'm curious to find what else may be hidden within it.  Verdict: An absolutely heavenly beer (literally!)",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Initial taste is green apple and finish taste is green apple. Clove can also be picked up making me think of an apple pie. A little Belgian yeast on the palate but overall it's a clean and crisp flavor that is perfectly balanced between sweet and bitter.  M: Light body with lively carbonation and a silky texture.

IBUs? 330 ml bottled April 29, 2009 with a freshness date of April 20, 2014 poured into a Gouden Carolus chalice on September 15, 2010.  Appearance 5/5 Pours slightly hazy, amber-orange colored, with a huge, thick, creamy off-white head that lasted forever. Excellent lacing on the glass. Very inviting.  Aroma 4/5 Fruity and spicy, as expected. The fruit character is of fresh fruit, not dry/dark. Not much funk here though; could be because of the relatively young bottle.  Taste 4/5 Very spicy and fruity with some fruity tartness, and possibly, pepper. Flavorful, yet very light on palate. Another very unique taste that I can't quite place, but is not to my personal liking; hate to say this but it reminds me of detergent at some points. Warmth brings out the hop bitterness at the back of the tongue. Also, the balance of the beer shifts from fruit to spice as the temperature increases. Extremely dry finish; although some remnant maltiness and bitter aftertaste is felt overall.  Mouthfeel 5/5 Light and crisp. Generously carbonated and very refreshing.

I would kill for access to their yeast, because the flavors it yields are complex, mercurial and just perfect. The nose merely hints at the taste, offering snatches of citrus and spice, but the taste is incomparable.  As a Trappist ale, it's got a little more juice than a standard pale at near 7%, but you'd never know it to drink it. The alcohol is completely subsumed in the flavors of this darkened gold ale.  Just an amazing beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Taste is smooth up front with prickly carbonation on the tongue. There are mouth-coating flavors of almost creamy, light caramel flavors along with fruit such as peaches and lemons. The beer exiting brings a nice balancing hop bitterness along with a tartness that combine for a very dry finish. This beer improves immensely as it warms, near room temperature is probably my favorite.  Mouthfeel is medium, leaning towards thin with fairly high carbonation. The flavors coat the mouth well.

37,129,Bubba83,4.34,"Poured into a tulip at around 50 degrees.  Dark orange amber color with a dark brown quality towards the top of the beer. Almost appears two-tone. Despite my careful pouring, a lot of yeast got into the glass and made the beer extremely cloudy. Also, there was like four finger widths of head. The color of the head is a light brown. Good retention, and good lacing, despite the rather large bubbles.  Hugely complex and aromatic brett character. Pineapple, mango, tart green apple, rose pedal are among the more vibrant aromas. A lot of barnyard funk here too, straw/hay, balsamic vinegar, black pepper, and dirty earth. Loving it, but I can't seem to smell much past the yeast. MAYBE some underlying caramel, just maybe.  Gigantic green apple note up front with some lemon, which gives way to some tropical fruit flavors including a noticeable amount of pineapple. In the mid-range the funk hits HARD. Big barnyard sweat and salt battles with the tropical fruits for dominance. Taste is rounded out with a bit of vinegar, sourness, and peppery spice in the finish, which is incredibly dry. Some bread is apparent in the background throughout the flavor too. It just doesn't get more complex than this.  Mouthfeel is SUPER DUPER DRY. Holy crap it's like my tongue is sand paper right now. Consistency is about right on, but the way it sort of bubbles up in your mouth all airy, it really is kinda rough on the palate. I have to dock it a bit for that, but it's still an experience to say the least. No alcohol presence to speak of.  Overall it's the standard if you're looking to showoff brettanomyces' potential in its rawest form. It's tough to find another beer similar, so it has a great originality to it and is great fun to drink. I can't wait to try the newest batch of Sanctification and see if Vinnie got a lot closer to Orval like he has openly said he wanted to with the new batch.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

A bit biscuity with fruit flavors playing subtley in. A bit of that brett yeast flavor as well. M- Ridiculously light body but substantiated by a snappy carbonation. Very much a dry finish.

Taste & Mouth - The beer has a great mouth feel, there is a lot of carbonation, and it works well with the flavour of the beer. I can taste citrus zest, a grassiness, and some sweet notes - similar to grape juice. In the middle I can pick up on a slight bitterness and the hops. The beer finishes with an absolutely perfect balance of sweet and bitter that makes me want to go back for more.  Drink - Wow, one of the better beers I have ever had.

37,129,eclaycamp,4.85,"Orvall is arguably the most recognizable and respected of all the Trappist breweries, save perhaps for Chimay. Orval is immediately identifiable by their unusual bottle shape. It looks like a small brown bowling pin.  12 ounce bottled pulled into a rudimentary glass chalice. I poured this one slowly and tossed out a bit to avoid having the beer overpowered by the yeast cake on the bottom of the bottle. The beer is tangerine in color, more orange than I remember. It's the color of sun tea. Small bubbles make up a larger rocky head. Nice lacing that looks a lot like dish soap. Solid inch worth of head on this one, even with my conservative pouring efforts. Smell is amazing, intoxicating. I get some light hits of yeasty clove and bananas to start things off, before things get a little more hefty. There's a strong fruit presence here, with some cherry standing out for me. Im also getting a distinct apple presence. Combined with the malt profile it's almost like smelling a hot apple pie. There's also some clear earthy barnyard funkiness going on. Mouthfeel is light, almost to the point of effervescence, and there's very little in terms of bitterness.  I haven't had Orval in quite some time. My first real drink in a long while just takes the concept of Trappist beer and turns it directly on it's ear. Huge amount of dry and musky Brett yeast can be found through out the beer, adding an incredible amount of flavor. Hop character is relatively muted, though it's there up front. Reminds me of pear cactus. While there's a ton of things going on, the beer remains an absolute joy to drink. The light body makes this a very quaffable beer, though the flavor profile encourages you to meander. As the beer warms it offers you more, as the brett notes start to highlight more of the caramel malt profile.  Those with a patient palate will find that this beer offers a level of enjoyment few others can match. For me, it's so good it borders on ridiculous. There's really nothing to fault within this beer. Impeccable, simply incomparable. Highly recommended.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Aroma is sweet, getting some light fruity notes (some plum) and a very, dry vinous feel to it as well. Taste is fairly similar, I'm getting a very dry vinous feel to it (although very, very muted in the vinous sense) with some relatively darker stone fruits (again, plum primarily) and some raisin as well.

M- A little thin, but creamy and nicely carbonated.  D- Very high. Strange to be saying about a Trappist Ale, IMO, but it was refreshing and went well with the football game I was watching.  Not knock your socks off in flavor or complexity, but a humble and subtle brew that is still outstanding. Very well-balanced, very drinkable, and very tasty.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,bmwats,4.12,"Poured from a 33 cl bottle into my Orval chalice.  A: Pours a medium, kinda' dirty, reddish, brown. About a 1 finger, foamy, beige head. Settles fairly slowly, leaving little patches of coagulated foam on the surface, and a beer ring buildup around the rim. Sticky beer ring lacing forms as you drink it down. Head never really totally dissipates.  S: A light roasted malt, raisin, orange citrus, clove, and just a bit of a floral note.  T: Light malt flavor, slight bitter hop, and almost a lemon pepper and coriander note. Just a subtle touch of the raisin that came out in the nose makes an appearance in the palette.  M: Light body, lightly hoppy and steely palette, dry finish, and something of a strong alcohol tone.  D: Sip and savor.  Atmosphere is great. Really great appearance with a rich, pure hue and a nice primary head which settles into a great secondary head that remains throughout. Nose is a great combination of grain, sweet, and spice components. Flavor is hearty and pure with a great balance. The sweet notes don't come out so much in the flavor making for a nice dynamic. The sweet notes tease the nose, but don't distract or cloy in the palette. Overall, this is a great quaff.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,ryanobeirne,4.06,"A - Super high carbonation! I'm assuming that is due to the bottle conditioning. I actually have two pours from this bottle. The first is a quick pour into a pint glass that fills the glass but is about 80% foam. The head is bubbly and dense but only lasting about two minutes or so. The second pour is much slower and into a goblet with almost no head. The color is a bright golden color with a slight pale amber haze. Looks very delicious.  S - Smells slightly sour with a sweet undertone. I can almost feel the carbonation in my nose.  T - This beer is mostly about the malt, I think, the hops having a secondary role. The sourness doesn't come through as much in the taste as it does in the smell. The flavor has a bit of a sharpness to it, much like a sharp cheddar cheese, although it's definitely not cheesy. This beer is very complex and inviting, yet it still seems like something is missing. I don't know what's missing, but I think the monks are on to something over there at Orval!  M - Very carbonated, very tingly on the tongue. Even the last sip gets a bit of buzz from the bubbles. Incredibly smooth and almost creamy without being heavy.  D - Very drinkable: I don't want this beer to end! But, alas, it does, and I am left wanting more! I'll be sure to revisit this one in the future.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,earthboundagain,4.05,"Ok been wanting to try this beer for a while, but been putting it off, this bottle is about 14 months old, so I hope it is as good as I am hoping.  Ok the color is a dark honey with a super fluffy of whit head, the beer laces like a champ.  Ok the nose is very complex, and it is hard to sort it all out, but we do have some various spices, light funk, lemon peel, and an earthy mustiness.  Ok the flavor is as complex as the nose. We have some floral hops, mixed with a burst of spice, all intertwined with some lemon peel. The funk in the nose does not show up in the taste though. The beer is a sipper and takes a whack at the ole palate.  The mouthfeel is dry and well carbonated and is built on a slightly full body.  I like this beer but at $4.99 it will be a nice treat.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Daniellobo,4.33,"Quite the funky classic. Rich in range, yet nicely delicate.  Presentation: 11.2 oz vase shaped, brown, capped bottle. Small label with the fish icon design of Orval, and Trappist seal. Shows bottling date (30/12/2009), best before (30/12/2014), and Alc. by Vol. (6.9%)  A - Lightly hazed, medium amber pour. Towering foamy head, medium retention, nice surface memory and good lacing.  S - Tart nose with a citrusy sense, touch of spices.  T - Nice funky sense, the Brettanomyces yeast of the bottle fermentation is beautifully evident, hoppy citrus sense, grassy touch. It is not overwhelmingly funky, not at all, in fact, if anything it is the subtlety alongside a saison-like memory that makes it rather rich.  M - Light-medium body with generous carbonation and a nice long dry finish.  D - Works like a charm, the subtle range is very nicely woven into a very desirable brew. If one is keen on funky brews, that is...  Notes: Quite the classic. Quite balanced and subtle on this incarnation, a classic reference not only for Trappist offerings but for Brett tasting. The least unexpected of Trappist ales, which always reminds that it is a denomination and not a style.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,NODAK,3.7,"Smell is very interesting, and pungent. Smells of peppery spices, yeast (which I've read is an uncommon yeast to use), fruit, and some tartness. I saw it described as ""leather"" on another site, and it isn't a bad descripter. It's a complex aroma.  Carbonation is pretty high. Has a thick head when poured. There's a short initial sweet fruit taste that is swept away by the predominant taste of this beer...which is a yeasty, earthy sensation. I also think the ""leathery"" taste on the nose transfers into the taste. The finish has a bit of spice on it, with a little tropical fruit. The finish is tart and dry...the mouthfeel is somewhat thin, so not much sticks around. Very little hop bitterness on the backend.  This is a very interesting beer. It may not be my favorite trappist, but it's worth respect.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,jampics2,4.08,"Bottle at around 6 months of age. Sampled at the Winking Lizard and poured into a cool Orval glass.  Looks nice in it's branded vessel. Orange/copper with some amber and caramel swatches painted here and there. Nice head retention and lace. Very strong start.  Smells of bright hops and mild brett. Some orange and lemon, with some horsehair. Not too barnyard like a stinky gueze, but a nice touch of brett.  Taste is nicely balanced between the base beer, the hops, and the wild edge. The base beer is light and sweet, with just enough malt. The hops give some orange and other citrus notes. The wild funk gives a dusty and basement flavor, but it's nice and balanced. The brett hasn't taken over yet.  The beer has decent body, but the carbonation is a little out of control. This doesn't need to sparkle so much - other trappists with the same sparkling carb have a better overall feel. This is just a bit distracting. I like Orval and it is a classic, but I like more modern BPA's more without the wild edge. I would and will drink this again.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,sellmeagod,3.87,"The monks know how to get you drunk. These trappist brews always break on through.  What's great about the beer is how well it plays out the expectations. It will be a classy beer. You know this; the price tag shows this.  And what do you find? It will look like a classy beer. The monstrous head just makes you think of having a merry time, and it's truly a joyful time peering through the golden colored brew.  It will taste like a finely balanced, delicious, classy beer. Dry, carbonated, blast to the tongue.  There's nothing exciting about it, and this has to be the only complaint. Surely, though, we don't want a Pale Belgian to be doing too much radically, so this hardly matters. 6.9 abv is precisely what it needs to be for you not to taste it and then to feel it nicely.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Smell: Smells of spicy fruit and some sweet malt.  Taste: Very powerful spicy hops up front. The sweet malt present in the nose takes a backseat and seems to make a hint of a return in the finish. Fairly dry and full of fruit and spice. The alcohol is almost unidentifiable.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and highly carbonated.  Drinkability: Simply delicious, and can only fully be appreciated slowly. Although it takes me a while to finish this one, its only because I don't want it to be gone.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

The beer itself changed from a pale yellow amber at the thinnest part of the glass to a gorgeous orange/tan at a thicker spot. Slightly hazed.  Interesting smell that pulls out funk, malt, and spices. I can't identify the spices here, and I hope they are coming just from the yeast.  Amazing flavor! The funk is up front but so beautifully balanced and nuanced that it really is a pleasure to drink this beer. Excellent malt and spices on the finish, and just a little astringency that puts a twist on the flavor.  Highly carbonated but bubble size is tiny so it's like a pillow on your tongue. Medium body.  Highly drinkable, and I would love many more of these. For $5 and change, this is a go to beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Haven't ever smelled anything quite like it. Its a little odd, but in a good way. 4  T: Not what I expected. Strong phenolic hops. Orange spice. White wine. Some funk barniness to it as well.

With all due respect the the other reviewer that compares this beer to Goose Island's Matilda, I completely disagree. I was anxious to try Matilda and recently purchased a four pack.

37,129,Mitchster,2.5,"$5.99 for a 11.2oz bottle at Jacks. 6.9% ABV. Bottled on 11/13/08, best by 11/13/13.  I've had this beer a few times, but it's not a regular, so I was surprised to see that I hadn't reviewed it on BA before. Considered a classic by some. Pours out to a lightly chill hazed medium amber, forming a large white head despite a careful pour, with excellent retention and sticky delicate Belgian lace. The carbonation is medium-strong. The aroma opens with the smell of honey, followed by that classic horse blanket, farmhouse musty basement sour funk of Brettanomyces that I adore...much different than most Trappist ales which don't ferment with Brett at all. The funk is followed by orange and pineapple....a deliciously tempting beer. The mouthfeel is spritzy and explodes upon the tongue with a light body. The taste opens with a short-lived tartness, followed by a very strong unpleasant metallic bitterness, spicy cloves, fusels and other higher alcohols, and finishes bone-dry with more metals and higher alcohols. No sweetness whatsoever. Aftertaste of wet cardboard and newspaper. Ugh.  I'm not a big fan. It smells delicious, but it needs more sweetness and less bitterness to balance the tartness of the Brett, no fusels, less carbonation and more body. At $5.99 for a wimpy bottle, skip this and get some De Proef, De Dolle, Duchesse, Rodenbach, or Zoetzuur.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

There is a one finger thick off white head. Lots of nice lacing going on.  S: Tart, yet sweet, green apple dominates this one. THere are nice fruity esters and some phenolic notes coming through. There is a definite presence of some nice yeast notes and subtle undertones of barnyard-like aromas.  T: There is a nice yeasty, estery base which supports the green apple flavors, quite similar to the smell. I get some hint of the brett through the baryard like flavors I get. There is also more bitterness here than I would have expected, I definitely do not remember detecting any last time I tried it. I'm not sure I'm a huge fan of this bitterness but it does fit the style well. Finish is quite dry with some lingering fruity esters and bitterness.  M: Surprisingly more carbonated than I would have expected. Medium bodied overall.  D: This is a very good beer and I could definitely see having a few of these throughout the course of the night but its no session beer...especially considering the price tag on this one.  Notes: I enjoyed this one quite a bit but its not as good as I remember it being when I tried it a year ago. Stil a very good beer and I'll still try it again from time to time.

Some nice light fruit flavors specifically strawberry. A bit of yeast there as well.  M: Thin to medium bodied, but with effervescent carbonation.  D: Good, but not really my bag. I get why it is popular, and appreciate the style, but I think I would stick to the other trappist styles.

The middle has a nice crisp, tart edge to it that's very refreshing with intense spiciness, a hint of vanilla and underlying sour apple cider.

Tarragon, ginger and the aroma of Campari (or SanBitter).  Palate: Crisp with some acidity and hop bitterness. Flavors of oak, licorice and herbs/botanicals. I've never noticed the similarities between Campari and Orval, but it's super obvious today. Herbs, bitter orange peel, blood orange and botanicals plus wood.

The beer tastes fairly light for a Belgium, and I guess with the abv. you could probably drink a few of these, were price not an obstacle.

A: A beautiful amber brown pour with a thick head that dissipates quickly leaving some lace.  S: Smells heady, some yeast, some bread and biscuits, and candy.  T: Almost no bitter taste at all, again it tastes of bread (like the kind they serve in fancy restaurants), some hint of candy and spearmint. Really complex and lots of fruity flavours that I couldn't quite tease out.  M: Medium bodied with good carbonation. This was the weakest part of the beer in my view.

Served cold in a chilled pint glass.  Huge frothy tan head, 4"" of foam on top of 1"" of beer early into a moderately strong pour. Had to back off quickly or it would've easily gone over the rim. Decided to smell it as I wati for it to settle a bit. Pretty complex, a lot going on... semi-sweet, hops, spices, citrus, earthy. There's a bunch of cinnamon, yeast, dry lemon rind. The brew itself is a dark murky yellowish brown. The head is hugely chunky, parts have settled to create a 1"" deep canyon across the middle of my glass. The foam is finally to a drinkable level, so here goes. It's completely dry throughout, nothing sweet at all, somewhat fizzy. Dry lemon rind, cinnamon, yeast, parsley. Moderately hoppy and very herbal. Some lemon zest and parsley in the dry finish.  Overall I think it's a good beer but I'd stop far short of calling it fantastic.

This one lasted till the end, since I was so stoked, I wanted to save what I guessed would be the best for the last. We will see.  A monsterous head, fluffy and barely off-white, is a defining characteristic, with a glowing orange color in the body. Hazy and majestic.  The aroma is underutilized here, a foggy floral bouquet and little additional hop or malt character to it. Pleasant yet forgettable.  The flavor...oh, the flavor. A wildly successful blast of bitterness and sweetness, with a multi-layered fruity taste of grapefruit, apple and red grape. Great balance in the amount of hop character, a good dose of bitter.  High carbonation levels in the mouthfeel. A boisterous brew.  Magnificent effort, a subdued aroma meets a crushing flavor, and grand all around.

S - Blueberry and a touch of black bean vinegar in the yeast. Lovely. Smells Dance along in the bubbles up into your nose giving hopes of syrupy candied delights. Only slightly malty.  T - More bitter than I initially imagined. Slightly dry. Before adding all the yeast from the bottle it was sour after adding it all it was much more wholesome and rounded. Just a touch of vegimite. Spices were there and I'll give this beer points for uniqueness but not for flavor.  M - Loose like white wine or cooking sherry  D - Overall good appearance and enticing smell but flavor left something to be desired average but not worth premium Belgian prices.

37,129,mmva321,4.9,"Poured into a chalice.  After Chimay, this is my second experience with a trappist brewery. Chimay Red was a definitive experience for me, let's see about this.  A complex, but clear appearance. There are little details I like about this, but the beautful amber body stands out brilliantly. Both the oranges and yellows stand out but blend to make a spectacular color. There is about 2.5-3 fingers of rocky white head that has an appropriate retention. A thick column of carbonation continually jets out from the center while little pillars lace the side.  The auroma fits my personal preferences very well. I love that the sweeter and smoother smells like banana and malts blend very well with slightly funky yeasts to create a velvety smell. But there is also a slight pop to the smell which comes from some understated hops and some lighter fruits such as pear and lemon.  A complex and challenging taste that isn't always easily enjoyable but is rewarding all the more. It seems to evolve in your mouth, starting out sweet and fruity and ending dry and sour and in between there is not a static moment as the taste...???? I can't really explain it. It's a hard beer to describe and each sip seems different as you discover something new. You need to try it.  My one complaint. The carbonation is too much for me. From the pour, the carbonation is very audible and it was no surprise that this would feel very bubbly. It makes the thin beer substantial, but it's a little too distracting and dominating in the mouth.  This beer is such a pleasure to take relaxed and slowly, but it's gone in the blink of an eye. The Orval Ale is perhaps my new favorite beer and one that I could drink every day for the rest of my life and be happy.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Loads of thick, patchy lacing grace the glass. Impressive.  Nose is floral (I get rose), with some fruity notes, peach pear and apricot. A touch of funky malt and yeast to the nose as well.  A surprisingly dry, sour Trappist - certainly unique among the Trappist lineup. Begins sweet and fruity, but the dry, cider-like quality dominites the finish. Notes of apple, pear and pepper. Dry and refreshing.  Hearty carbonation helps the floral and fruit notes to pop.  A great brew, certainly drier and more subtle than the other Trappists, but very drinkable.

Good spice and banana notes, not as pronounced as most Belgians I have tried.  M: The high carbonation is fantastic for this style. Brings out the floral and citrus notes quite nicely. Good pepper bite on the aftertaste as well. Crisp and complex. Divine BPA.  D: This beer is finding its way into my stomach rather quickly, fantastic drinkability.

Pours a cloudy amber color with a huge head that disippates somewhat quickly, but sticks around about a half finger for most of the drink. Leaves a fairly nice lacing as well. Way less sediment than I am used to in a trappist ale.  Nose - Spices such as coriander and other belgian ale spices dominate, belgian yeasts are definitely there. I also smell some metal-like earthy notes. This smells unlike any other Trappist ale I have tried.  Taste/Mouthfeel - Again, follows the nose in that this is far different from any Trappist ale I have tried. Tastes sour initially, with hints of cherries and some citrus. Belgian spices dominate. Carbonation is medium, but more apparent than others in this style.  Drinkability - Very very refreshing for a Belgian. If it didn't cost $5 for 11 oz, I could drink this stuff regularly. The ABV is pretty low for a trappist as well, which helps with downing it. So with price factored in, I don't find it drinkable, but if price doesn't matter for you, give this one a try for sure!",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,bylerteck,4.4,"330mL bottle into a Leffe chalice. Bottled 26/01/2010.  A - Solid two finger head of frothy, pillowy lucious beauty. Huge bubbles cling to the glass but it fades quickly. Still looks great though. Very effervescent, darkish amber, organgey colour with strong carbonation. A lovely beer.  S - Good amount of hops in the aroma. Smells yeasty too with what I can only assume is what Americans always call 'funk'. Smells what I would describe and fresh and lively with some citrus. The aroma is really complex and intriguing.  T - Woah. Funk is definately evident. Hops aren't as present as they are in the aroma. My entire mouth is working hard to figure this beer out. I now understand the funkiness described. There is some definate sweetness to it too.  M - Taste lingers for a LONG time and carbonation is obvious as it moves around in the mouth.  D - This baby is great. Really complex flavour with lower abv for a trappist brew.  The famous Orval! I've had t his a few times and never really took the time to appreciate it. I would have liked more hops but this has just the right amount of balance. Delicious!",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Liquid is too dark to even see the carbonation, but the slightest bit of light peaks in at the bottom of the glass. A mysterious and intriguing beer.  Musky! Scent is dank and mildewy, with hints of tart lemon zest, sugar, acidity and a hint of warming alcohol. Absolutely awesome and wholly inviting.  The flavor is amorphous, seamlessly shifting from lemon to dark berry to tangerine to grape. The sugary aspects are understated, as is the concluding dryness. Certain aspects reminded me of white wine (i.e. the sourness), but the bite of carbonation was all its own. This is a beer that gets better each time I try it.  Liquid is so smooth and balanced from front to back, masterfully coating the tongue while developing such a bevy of flavors.  I've been getting sick of overly sugared Belgians ales as of late and this beer is the perfect antidote. A great balance between flavors and so easy to drink.

This is an extremely complex beers, as are all the Trappist brews are.  Mouthfeel:Carbonated and medium bodied. Reminds me of heavier ciders.

A: Pours a cloudy copper color with a massive off white head that takes quite a while to die down and never really goes away. A good amount of lacing is left on the glass.  S: The faint aroma of yellow apples. A little bit of lemon. A good bit of brett funk coming through with this one being a year old. The hops are still there in the background, but you've really got to search for them.  T: The hops are have faded and are definitely more subtle than when fresh, but they're still detectable. The brett has come to the foreground as opposed to being much less noticeable in a fresh bottle. A bit of tart apple flavor. Just a touch sour. A slight bit of a phenolic medicinal prescence as the beer warms.  M: Good, moderate carbonation but just oh so smooth and very creamy. The thin cap of foam that never leaves certainly helps this. Medium bodied.  D: Off the charts. This is simply a great beer that goes down very easy while at the same time remaining intensely complex. I will be stocking up on a lot more of this one.

When the head finally subsides it leaves good lace on the upper reaches of the glass.  Smell: WOW, now here is something truly special, certainly one of the most complex aromas I have come across. The nose is dominated by a funky barnyard aroma, consisting of horse blanket, musty leather, woodiness, wild sage etc. I grew up on a farm so I love this smell, though I can see why some people find it a tad offensive.  Taste: As with the nose, funky barnyard dominates. A slight woodiness and some bitter herbs are also present. Slightly tart (though I was expecting more). Hops come through fairly well in the ultra long, dry finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a high level of carbonation. Thankfully the carbonation is smooth and quite soft of the palate and thus doesn't ruin the mouthfeel for me (I usually do not enjoy highly carbonated beers).  Drinkability: Superb beer,I will most certaily have this again.  I love this beer, though I can see that there will be many who do not (my mother took one sip and was nearly sick...), but I think it's certainly a beer everyone should try at least once.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,Arbitrator,4.33,"Re-review. I first had this in Belgium in fall 09 and thought it was awful. I'd go back in time and smack myself if I could.  Chilled bottle into a glass.  A: Pours a lightly hazy amber color with copper highlights. The head is stunning; off-white, refreshed by generous effervescence up the glass, and retention that is nothing short of 10, probably 15 minutes. I pretty much had to let this sit and settle while I went off to do something else. I returned to find a mild cap on the film with thick lacing deposited by the receding head.  S: Pretty funky: it has that musty, hay / barnyard aroma that is characteristic of a bretty beer. Noble comes come through, giving this a perfumey, lemony aroma with hints of grass and spice.  T: That perfumey aroma translates to a distinct hoppy bitterness, accentuating the flavors of lemon to produce a lemon-rind combination. The brett adds a little funk to the end in the form of hay and leather. The finish is rounded out by flavors of grass and light spice. There's a metallic flavor to it that I don't enjoy, but that was the whole reason I revisited this beer: Russian River Sanctification (batch 4) has the same thing, and it reminded me off-hand of Orval. I wanted to try it again and see.  M: Light-medium bodied. Ample carbonation. It finishes dry.  D: An incredibly tasty beer. It's a shame this took me two tries to appreciate, but it's a good demonstration of how quickly a palate can evolve in 8 or 9 months. I have a bone to pick with the metallic flavor I get out of this thing, but otherwise I really enjoy it. Outstanding beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

I carefully poured to minimize the head yet it was a massive three fingers and the nucleation of the tulip caused a dense inner core held in place by a half inch very large bubble outer support - haven't seen this before. Ridiculous lacing as well !  Complicated nose, somewhat difficult to identify - yeast, hay, mild unknown fruit and a whiff of stale musty budweiser.  Taste surprises with the noticeable hops in the dry finish. No fruit sweetness, tiny bit sour. Both the yeast and hay are restrained. Not the easiest brew to describe.

Not sure if this was due to the age or potential shaken-ness/pressure of the bottle (the pop from opening it was the loudest thing I ever heard). Subsequent pours showed just as much head...but this glass really brings out the head in any beer. SUPER frothy. Lacing clung to the glass and might take some work to get off the glass (it's THAT clingy). Color was a soft amber honey color. Nice lively carbonation.  S - Banana, clove, some spices, bubblegum, candy, sugar. Smells awesome!  T - Taste follows the nose. Bubblegum and clove. SPICEY and sweet.  M - Surprisingly bitter mouthfeel and aftertaste. Beyond the bitterness, very smooth.  D - This one is pretty good. I was expecting a bit more based on the rave reviews. Very drinkable and extremely tasty.

S: Smells of Belgian yeast and spices with notes of nutmeg, ginger, coriander and clove. Hints of overly ripe bananas as well. Very very good smelling. T: Follows the nose with complex sweet, spicy and fruity flavors. Finish is full of hops that leave the aftertaste bitter, earthy, barnyardy, sour and a little funky. Very funky and sour actually. M: Carbonation froths up when it first hits your mouth but finishes very dry and slightly thin. Body is light, and despite the spritzy carbonation, a tad watery. D: Not the greatest aftertaste on this one, although I really like the nose. I'm glad I got to try it, but I probably won't seek this out again.

It also has a hexagon with the words ""Authentic Trappist Product"" within it. Given its size, shape, and density, you could easily bludgeon someone with this bottle. I love a beer that can make you incoherent in more ways than one!  Appearance- 4 out of 5. This beer pours a hazy amber-orange color with a mountainous four-finger head that is frothy and dense. It leaves lots of lacing all around the glass and takes a long time to die down. The head is seriously incredible.  Smell- 3.5 out of 5. Compared to the appearance, the smell is very light and subtle. It's good, but I wish it were stronger. There are fruity hints that can be compared to juniper, apple, and lemon, slight tartness from the hops, and an strangely intriguing scent that I have heard others refer to as being reminiscent of a barnyard, but not in a bad way. Imagine a rustic barnyard in sepia-tone with a shirtless peasant relaxing on a rake after a hard day's work, surrounded by aromatic hay and strong, muscular horses.  Taste- 4.5 out of 5. The taste matches the smell quite well. It's light but pleasing, with initial notes of malt and green apple that give way to a slightly sour taste of citrus. It finishes with a tart, mildly bitter bite of hops. It's complex but not in the often-arrogant way of beers that barge into your mouth and leave the untrained tongue confused about the complexity and confounded about the conflicting flavors; instead, Orval is crafted in such a way that anyone can take their time to linger over its subtle tastes and learn to appreciate them.  Mouthfeel- 4 out of 5. Light, easy, and smooth is the best way to describe this. It's crisp and leaves an unusual feeling on the top of the mouth. As it goes down, it fades from being wet to a dry aftertaste. The carbonation is noticeable but not particularly strong.  Drinkability- 4.5 out of 5. If it weren't so damnably expensive on this side of the Atlantic ($5.79 for an 11.2oz bottle), it would make regular appearances in my fridge; as it is, it's a delicious treat. It can easily be consumed in great quantity. For those of you who can afford it, Orval would make a great Summer beer. For those of you looking to break into the wide world of Belgian ales, this would be a good starting point because its flavors are fairly easy to pick out without being overwhelmed by the complexity and richness of the brew.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

S: There's a lot going on here. A tart hoppiness conceals the underlying sour/salty astringency that other reviewers seem to dub a ""barnyard smell."" I can see the comparison -- the smells suggests at sweaty horses or urine-soaked hay...this isn't nearly as unpleasant as it sounds.  T: Hard to describe. The flavours, largely light and difficult to pin down, swirl about, tending towards malts, sourness, and hops. This sweet/sour/bitter balance characterises the beer's main taste. The aftertaste is mostly bitter, but not very dry. The ""barnyard"" flavour does lurk in the backround, emerging every now and again to offer a strangely skunky or briny note. Overall, fascinating, but not obviously pleasant.  A: Feels great! Light and somewhat chewy, the initial carbonation and sourness arouse the taste buds, whilst the bitterness prolongs the sensations.  D: Under 7%, but it felt like significantly more.

The flavors really compliment each other at the warmer end of the drinking temp. rec's. The mouthfeel on this is quite possibly the best I have ever imbibed.

Fresh, not really that musty in nature, more just slight funk. Crisp aroma, malty and the Belgian yeast sneaks in through the funky flavors. Some lemony and honey flavors there too.  Man, I was expecting so much more from this beer from the aroma. I was excited about this! The taste falls flat, some slight funk, very dry, not very satisfying. This is disappointing.

Not sure why, but it caught my eye during my last beer run, and I grabbed a bottle. Always fun to crack open a legend for the first time.  Bottled 5/10/09, poured into a tulip.  Loud hiss as soon as I start to pry off the cap, so I know this one's going to be bubbly. Absolute monstrous wall of white foam fills just as much of the glass as the beer does. The pour is a surprisingly orange-amber one. Head retention is outstanding, and the glass is completely plastered with sticky lacing.  I'm smelling a pretty good bit of gueuze in Orval...lots of tart lemon and green apple, along with some barnyard funk. The flavor is essentially the same, with a very, very dry finish. It's funny - this is one of the more complex beers I've had, yet I don't have a whole lot to say about it. It's got flavors of Belgian Pale, British Pale, and Gueuze in it, which I really enjoy. There's a mineral-like (I don't want to say metallic) taste in the finish.  Fairly light body with very active carbonation. I can certainly see Orval being an acquired taste, and probably wouldn't have liked it two years ago when I was first exploring new beers.

All of the tastes are exceedingly balanced.  M - Light to medium body and medium-high carbonation. Explosive bubbles mellow to a tingly and mildly creamy feel.  O - A rich and refreshing experience. I shared this brew with my wife who isn't a fan of much bitterness but she really enjoyed it too since the hop bitterness is so well-integrated and balanced. I had to laugh when she said it reminded her of a really great Schlitz!  Notes: On 2011-06-17 I had this side-by-side with a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.

More spicy yeast notes, the definitive Belgian trappist flavor. Paired with very musty, earthy and funky Brett notes. The flavor is brightened nicely with a lemony acidity.

The first sip is non aggressive and dry. The body is thin and inviting. Very low bitterness meets biscuit and dark fruit. Champagne like body and mouthfeel pave the way for this complex ale. Dry from start to finish. Orval has a very floral aftertaste with a dry fruit balance. In winter cold or summer sun this ale will fit the bill.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Dubber55,3.78,"Bottled on 05/08/2009- I think that is August 5th, 2009  Pours a hazy golden hue with orange highlights. One and half fingers of white head. A lot of retention and plenty of lace.  Initially, I get an aroma of a musty barnyard. Along with that, I smell plenty of citrus like lemon and grapefruit, grass, hay, and I think some leather.  The taste initially consists of citrus with some peppery spice. There is also some kind of herbal and floral thing going on with a musty barnyard flavor. There is a decent amount of funk in this beer. In the midpalate, I am tasting some bready/biscuity malt and in the finish I taste lots of herbs, peppery spice, and hop bitterness. Dry finish.  Light to medium on the mouthfeel with some prickly carbonation.  The drinkability is above average. The alcohol is nicely hidden by the funkiness of this beer but the peppery spiciness is a bit much for me. I would also like a little less of the herbal/floral character in the flavor profile. With that being said, this is still a very good representation of the style.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Boto,4.47,"Slightly orangish in color, and slightly opaque. Big foamy head. Get aroma of spices, something that I wouldn't usually expect from this type of beer. Spices are also evident in the taste,as well as some fruitiness. Lacks the caramel taste of other trappistes. Has some hopiness that the others don't. It may be different from some of the other trappistes, but this is still an excellent brew. I'd definitely pay another $5 for a bottle.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,endovelico,4.6,"Bottled in 16/06/2009. Taken from notes. Reviewed in 05/06/2010. Poured into Chimay gobblet.  Appearance: Pours a hazy orange brew with a full three finger white head. Light perceived effervescence. No floaties.  Aroma: Intense aroma of orange zest, nectarines, lemon drop, roses and yeast. Some nuanced sourness and mild leather notes. Very complex with potential for alot more as it ages.  Taste: Medium high intensity. Follows up on the nose with orange zest, nectarine and some spiciness on the front. Yeast, citrus and melanoidin carameliness on the back. The Barnyard/Rustic character is not coming through much. I would rate it a 4 but i'll add half a point knowing the potential and range it brushes through as it ages.  Palate: Light medium carbonation, Low bitterness, Medium body and lasting yeasty and citrusy taste. No sourness and mild acidity. Finishes sweet. Drank it a bit too young, but still showcases amazing texture.  Drinkability: Perfect drinkability. It has undeniable potential as it ages achieving a wide range of profiles that will no doubt cover the quirkiest of tastes. You can't deny it's unique, interesting and complex yet accessible, PLUS it goes great with alot of different foods. This, in my mind, is what drinkability is about. Solid five.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Daniell,4.53,"I was heavily disappointed first time I tried this, turned out that was when I had a relatively fresh bottle. I've discovered a stock which were bottled on 2006, and have had far better experiences with them.  A: awesome head and really unique light red/gold colour. Halfway between a golden ale and a rosé. Head dies down perhaps a little quickly for my liking, compared to say Duvel, but I think I have to make this a 5 for the beautiful blood orange colour. 5  S: overripe, almost fermenting fruits. Smells a lot like a botrytis dessert wine actually, mixed with funk and bandaids. Later on as it warms the funk gets vaguely faecal, clovey and honey-y. It really has the sulphuric pale fruity smell I expect from white wines. I can honestly say I do like the liveliness of the funk here, it does make the beer feel alive. 4.5  T: actually get a decent amount of alcohol in the taste, along with fermented fruit. I notice a distinctive aftertaste- kind of nutty, like macadamias. This recedes to substantial bitterness. The bandaids I was overwhelmed by the first time I had this are still there, but they're more subtle. The bottling date is the 23rd of February 2006, which makes this brew more than four years old. It seems that the aging (despite presumably being in a freezer for a large proportion of that time) has tamed the brew compared to the severely band-aidy fresh one I had previously. 4.5  M: Just about right for the style. 4.5  D: One to sip but the complexity definitely keeps me coming back. 4.5  Definitely world class.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

You inhale the hops from the dry hopping greedily as it blends beautifully with the bouquet the yeast imparts. The color is a light sunset and the beer is slightly cloudy, with a good foamy head. The taste is slightly acidic, with invigorating hop notes that work as well with the spice of the yeast in taste as they do in the aroma--a beautiful marriage.

The nose has lots of tart peach(and other stone fruit??) lime juice, lemon, grassy, musty and earthy hops. A good deal of barnyard is also present. Peppery spice and possibly some lavender also as to the overall aroma.  The taste is a bit less tart than the nose suggests.Dry as a bone with lemony and other citrus flavors. VERY earthy and musty hops are used in abundance. I am not really sure I am digging this barnyard thing though. I must also not this brew is very yeasty.  Highly carbonated, ligher bodied and a crisp texture.  Again, this brew is complex as hell and has a very refreshing quality to it thanks to the mouthfeel.

It had a lemon orange appearance which reminded me of a half and half. There were some really nice lacing.  The smell was quite good as well. Floral and citrusy. A slight hint of malts.  The taste was was very light all things considering. A very well balanced beer. It had a wonderful taste of yeastiness and citrus. I found it to be extremely refreshing and quite drinkable.

Almost annoying because I am sitting here patiently waiting for it to go down and it is...but ever so slowly. Leaves chunky lacing on the sides of the glass. Pours a slight hazy deep golden color.  Smell - Banana, clove, slight barnyard funk (reminiscent of Jolly Pumpkin), bready yeast, and slight malt.  Taste - Immediate funky mouth puckering taste which gives way to a slight banana flavor. Massive amount of spices, slight hops, and grassy/hay flavor on the back end.  Mouthfeel - Medium to light bodied. Not as full as I would have expected but still good for what it is.  Drinkability - Relatively drinkable. This reminds me of a mix of delirium tremens and a really funk saison. An interesting beer and am glad to finally try it. Not in my top beer list but enjoyable nonetheless.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Krevee,3.88,"Drank 5/18/10 Poured from the bottle into a Bruery tulip  A - Pours a dark orange with hints of red. This beer has a massive amount of head. I poured semi-aggressively and had to wait to finish pouring because of the amount of head. The head took quite a bit of time to fade, and even as I drank it there remained a little bit of head along with a good looking lace.  S - This beer has a very interesting smell. It has that brett funk, along with fruit and yeast. Also has a light sour smell. I enjoyed the smell quite a bit.  T - Taste as usual is similar to the smell. There is a very light sour/funky characteristic to this beers taste. Has the flavor of some lighter fruits such as apple/pear. I can also taste a little bit of spice and yeast.  M - Mouthfeel was disappointing to me. I know this beer was not flat because of the head, but when I drank it, it felt flat in my mouth. The consistency was alright it felt very smooth with a light/medium body. It also leaves a residue in the mouth after taking a sip.  D - Drinkability is alright a little above average because of the ABV I could not drink to many of these. It also has some alcohol heat to it that makes it difficult to drink to many. Along with this beers mouthfeel lowers the drinkability for me.  Overall this is a beautiful beer with a good taste and smell, but the mouthfeel killed some part of it for me. It was hard drinking it at times when it felt like there was no carbonation. Maybe it was just the bottle I had, but I did get this beer from Hi Times Wines Cellar so I doubt quality control was the issue. I guess I will just have to revisit this beer some time.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Once the foam dies down a bit, the aroma has all the hallmarks of a traditional Belgian with notes of warm bread, caramel and malty goodness.  The flavor changes a lot as it warms up and it changes for the better - some sour notes even seem to come out. This is definitely one you want to let sit for a few minutes before drinking. Overall the palate is similar to the nose. There is a nice but not overwhelming bubbly carbonation that creates an interesting dry finish.

Taste - I haven't tasted enough into the triple digits to have any authority, I admit, but of what I've had so far, Orval's is definitely the most balanced beer I've had. Champagne hints for sure.

The head foams up quickly, and leaves a massive, thick white head on top. A lot of carbonation bubbles are visible in the glass.  The aroma is a nice mix between lemony hops and a fruity, funky yeast character. The brettanomyces adds aromas of leather and rainfall. As I understand, this beer changes a ton with age, but I like where it is right now.  The mouthfeel is very dry with a lot of carbonation but with a firm substance. This beer leaves a drying, leathery feel on the finish. Malt flavor and sweetness seems to stay out of the way, but the funky brett flavors and bitter finish take over. It has a deep, earthy flavor to it with the flavor of dirt, wet leaves, and wild flowers. The finish has the combination of bitter hops and leathery dryness. There isn't much acidity, but the brett leaves a salty flavor throughout.  This beer is really interesting. I'd love to get this again for food pairing or age variations.

A hazy caramel orange pumpkin is what I came up with for the color. Superior frothy head, slightly off white. Nice globby lacing after the first pour, I took 10 minutes to let that settle and finished off the pour. Nice and frothy.  Mellow yeast notes on the nose. Apples, citrus, apricots as well. Maybe some brett? If so, very mild.  Mildly hoppy, nice yeast tastes and smooth maltiness. Bread, bananas, and some soft fruit flavors.  Incredibly light for the abv, so nice to drink.

Head is off-white, airy and voluminous.  Leathery brettomyces and stinging CO2 aromas greet the nose along with a fair dose of honeyed malt. Simplistic yet appealing smell on this classic.  Wow, this is probably one of the easiest brett-forward beers to drink you could ever find. Sharp hops along with the brett provide a very dry, crisp and damn refreshing beer. Citrusy lemon flavors along with a spritzy carbonation accentuate the effect. Malts are there, lightly honeyed, but the main show is the brettomyces and solid hops. It has been a few years since my last Orval and like an old friend, I cant believe how much I missed it. I could drink this all summer long, but the price point is preventative of that. A very delicious beer and I cannot wait to taste the other couple in the cellar with some more brett coming to the forefront as time passes.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

But the bitter scent of his trump Orval. Especially young Orval 4 to 5 months old has illuminated buttons of unripe fruit like banana, pineapple, lemon and pear.

White candy landfill. The abundant supply of hops smell it at the hop pocket and say to some fresh getanneerd leather (hops: Bavarian Hallertau, Slovenian Styrian Golden East Kent Golding pellets and in the cones for dry hopping.)

There is also a slight acidity in the mouth typical of wild yeast. This festival of hops still rests on a very convincing, juicy, malty body. Finish / aftertaste: A very dry (Sec) and hop bitter aftertaste to and little or no residual sugar. It is a very good digestive. Decision: For one, it is because of his meager beer bitterness and the other was full, but the bitter taste is in harmony with the soft and well Brewing Information: Malts are: pale malt beers: as Beauce, Gratinais, Unterfranken and Prisma and caramel malt, Cara Vienne and hop varieties are Hallertau-Herzbrucker from Bavaria and Styria, Golding from Slovenia, and the Dry-hopping one uses Golding from East Kent UK The sugar is kind of candy.

A - Dark amber colour with a thick creamy head. Few carbonation bubbles. Lacing is ok.  S - Sweet wheat, with several fruit aromas and a hint of clove. Of the fruity aromas bananas is most prominent with a touch of cherry as well. Also some creamy cheese in the mix somewhere. Bubblegum becoming apparent later on too.  T - Strong on bitterness - the creamy head doesn't really come through. Carbonation more obvious when consumed. Main tastes are a mix of banana and some other burnt red berry flavours combined with heaps of herbs like pepper and cloves.  M - Quite bitter-sweet. Carbonation is powerful so has a kind of sugary soda/candy texture.  D - Not a bad drop but way too much fizz. Could stomach the beer in quantity but the gas would be a killer.

37,129,AleWatcher,4.62,"This is my first Orval... So here goes--  I poured this into my Duvel tulip with the same method of pouring I always use... It filled up the entire glass with head. It literally rose all the way to the top and stopped just before cascading over the sides! It was as though I used the Jedi mind trick on it. Anyway... the color is burnt orangey gold. The giant fluffy head reminds me of lemon meringue pie filling and leaves spotty chunks of lacing just from settling.  Smells of lemons and fresh herbal grassiness. Maybe a light spicy yeast note too. There seems to be a little fruitiness in here-- banana? plantain? even a slight scent of bubble gum. A slight funky earthiness blends in and fills the gap between each scent making it hard to fully distinguish them. That leads directly into the taste as well... There are certainly some herbal, grassy, and fruity notes, with hints of bananas. But just like in smell, there is a touch of funk that blends them all together. Very interesting. Very little hop presence, but it still works in terms of taste. Something here reminds me of apple juice...  Very dry finish. Actually between the finish and the mouthfeel, you could possibly convince some people that this was a new type of flavored champagne. The feel is very light and airy with lots and lots of fine bubbles fizzing around your mouth.  To rate this beer in terms of drinkability--- It's hard to believe this is 7% abv. It is deceptively smooth. I could certainly drink 3 or 4 of these before standing up and noticing my level of inebriation. And perhaps I'll pick up a few more and conduct such an experiment.

37,129,Naugros,4.26,"What a beautiful beer. The head forms immediately and the structure is such that I overpoured and thought I'd lose some of the head down the sides, but no! It stood up on its own a good two fingers above the rim of the glass. The color is amber and cloudy, more opaque than many in this style.  It smells of fragrant wood or cooking wheat bread with some spice and citrus in the background. The floral aspect tells you it's a Belgian.  Oh wow! I immediately got oranges. The sour and citrusy flavors combined to make it seem like this was a beer brewed with oranges, it was that strong of an impression on my tongue. Bolstering that flavor is a bread-like taste further back on the tongue...maybe one of those whole grain loafs.  I usually first sip a beer that I have not tried yet, but this one invited me to gulp, and gulp I did. Just two and then I started to taste. It doesn't attack the back of the mouth, but lingers on the tongue daring you to explain the complexities (and I felt I have done a poor job here).

37,129,eat,4.67,"Bottled 29/04/2009, so it's a few days over a year old now. The bottle says you can age this one all the way until 2014. Being able to age a beer of 6.9% for five years is pretty impressive.  Poured into my Chimay goblet, which looked to be the closest thing I had to the proper Orval glass. Orval pours with a copious, densely-foamy orange-tinged white head. Lacing could be better. The retention is amazing, with a raft of head hanging out like it's a pancake. The beer is opaque with suspended sediment and dull-copper in colour. Some mysterious black specs rest at the bottom of the glass.  Huge, delicious smell. Candied lemon, wheat, yeast, tart green apple, cherries, white wine, white pepper, light brett and a subtle spice blend. This beer smells fantastic! Super complex and seriously exceptional. Easily one of the best smelling beers I've had.  This beer is really complex. A solid amount of brett character, ginger ale, white wine vinegar, dust, sweet malt, green apple. Hops seem to get mostly buried in the flavour but come into play on the finish, where they impart an almost perfect balance. I feel like I might enjoy a little more of a malt base, if I was going to be picky. No alcohol present.  The feel is insanely good. This might be the best mouthfeel I've ever encountered; it's almost like a milkshake it's so thick and creamy. The foamy carbonation really works here. The finish is fairly drying; the kind that keeps you sipping.  I'm definitely stocking up on these next time I'm in Montreal. I could drink this stuff all the time. I really like how this is a little lighter than most other world-class Belgians; at 6.9% you could have a few at a time. It seems to pack the flavour of a much bigger beer into it's relatively low ABV. I'm glad I spent some time working up to this one, I feel like I can appreciate this beer now whereas a year-or-so ago I'm not sure I would have ""got"" it. Possibly an acquired taste but this beer is amazing.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Vonerichs,4.35,"Amber orange color with a ton of fluffy head. It was poured into a tulip and the head came all the way to the lip.  This has a very aromatic nose of funky yeast and tart fruits. Lemon, orange, and apple.  Exceptional taste, also. It mirrors the smell, plus the addition of banana and some herbal and spicy hops.  Mouthfeel is heavily carbonated and prickly on the tongue.  A very ejoyable Belgian Pale Ale that I'll definitely have again. It's very flavorful and has a complex variety.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,krisandajt,4.45,"Another tasty brew courtesy of a great trade with Adouble. I raise my glass to you, sir!  Appearance: Whoa, it appears we have ourselves a gusher! With what I thought was an easy pour, the beer nearly overflows clean out of my DFH Off-Centered pint glass. I barely got half the bottle in. I suppose carbonation isn't going to be an issue with this bad boy! Anyway, aside from the mountain of head (which is fading slowly, by the way), the beer is a cloudy, amber color that is surprisingly vibrant for a pale ale.  Smell: The smell is surprisingly strong for a pale ale. It reminds me more of what I'd expect from a tripel, or even a mild quad sans the sweet candied fruit. The smell is sweet, with a classic Belgian yeast characteristic. Outstanding.  Taste: In every aspect so far this beer has surprised me. The taste is no exception. For a Belgian Pale Ale, this beer packs some amazing flavor. There's a nice sweetness to the brew, with a bit of a grassy quality to it, all wrapped up with a nice Belgian-y finish. This is very very good.  Mouthfeel: If I had one grip about this beer, I would have to say that the mouthfeel is a bit thin. Maybe given the style it's what it should be, but with every other quality of this beer being so robust, the mouthfeel was a bit of a let down. Not necessarily bad, but not up to par with the rest of the beer.  Drinkability: I have to give this beer top marks. I've seen it on the shelf before, but I've always passed it by. I can safely say that that is a mistake I will not make again. This beer is fantastic, packing some immense flavor in a sessionable package. Coming close to 7% ABV, I don't think I could pack away too many in an evening, but I'd certainly give it a good shot. Definitely recommend.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

About 2 fingers below the rim of the glass w/ bead like ball bearings in rows stacked upon each other. The color of the brew is sort of orange and caramel golden w/ cream on top of off white. The clarity is hazed w/ incredible head retention, the lace clings well  S - I was drawn to the aroma w/ brett apparent in the cherry, cedar, tobacco and oak-like nose immediately. The scent of pink peppercorn, pineapple and rose petals w/ light orance rind, and kumquat all intertwined w/ a mild, subtle vanilla spiced note. The nose is seriously tropical with a passionfruit and mild mango note but the sweet woody cherry-like aromas pervade w/ mild spice like tobacco and gentle apple  M - a mild weet feel and highly effervescent w/ a slight tannic essence w/ fruit and tart tinged texture. There is mild spice edges w/ lightly bitter notes and bits of dry fruit skin w/ an herbal accent. The ale finishes lightly tart and dry  T -the taste is wonderful with the brett flavor which is cherry-like and tropical tinged w/ light pineapple flavor and mild woody tinges w/ a light pepper and lemon quality. The gentle floral and tea-like herbal hop quality w/ a subtle toasted note w/ mild honey tip is very delectable w/ hints of lemongrass and cherry skin w/ a mellow twiggy hop and toasted malt taste. The real standout is the brett which gives the dry yet full flavored fruit elemnent to the ale while I know it is a blend of Saccharomyces and Brettanomyces it is still great how balanced and light spice and brett is blended with tropical yeast flavor and spice/pine. The hop taste is hinted at and moves to a dry place which signals me to take another sip and start enjoying everything again w/ a lemony note w/ mild flavor of alcohol in the last sips as it nears cellar temp  D - The drinkability is sublime - stellar, inspirational brew - I have a lot of respect for the method and humble brilliance the monks exude in the style w/ plentle of subtlety and nuance, yet vibrant, intense flavor. The experience is a wonderful taste, words truly can't express it -something I wish I had on hand all the time",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Sam21,4.63,"11.2oz bottle into tulip. Bottled on November 13th, 2008.  Appearance - Glowing hazy orange with lively carbonation and a billowing white head that sticks to everything. A decent foam cap sticks around the entire time. Absolutely beautiful.  Smell - Clove, funk, lemon peel, freshly cut orange, green apple, maybe some pear, and a nice earthiness that holds it all together.  Taste - Citrus notes seem start off more subdued, but increase in intensity as the beer goes down. Funk comes out to play. Still picking up some apple, lemon peel, and orange, but they are really hidden within that textbook Brettanomyces medicinal funk. Spicy clove, grassy hops, and a hint (very slight) of alcohol in the finish. Crisp and complex.  Mouth Feel - Very light and fluffy across the tongue with a dry finish. Carbonation tickles the tongue very lightly.  Drinkability - A wonderful experience. Easy to drink, yet bursting with flavors. I will definitely be turning to this beer again and again... and again.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,richmof,4.26,"How to review Orval?  It is the most aesthetically pleasing beer in the world bar none. It pours from its beautifully curvy bottle into the most attractive beer glass there is. It is the one beer most Belgian bartenders can truly pour as well, which means you get a wonderfully frothy creamy head with solid lacing no matter where you go. The deep golden-orange should be relatively clear when probably poured - yeast on the side.  On this occasion, I am review from Chez Bernard in Place Jourdan, where I had the gout d'Orval.  The citrusy yeastiness starts on the nose and continues through to the palate where it is complemented by a hoppy spice quality. Those herby Brettons doing their work.  It rarely disappoints although three is usually enough for a sitting. I am looking forward to those bottles I have put down.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,yeahnatenelson,4.77,"Appearance - Pours a murky brown, like unfiltered apple cider, with a billowing head.  Smell - Lemon, white grapes, musty apple skin, and a little bit of funk.  Taste - Tart, slightly musty, easily one of the driest beers I've ever come across. Musty apple, sour grapes, dry white wine, white pepper. There is more hop bitterness than I expected, definitely a plus. After a little while you notice a little bit of dark fruit sweetness buried in the finish that St. Bernardus beats you over the head with.  Mouthfeel - Light-bodied, highly carbonated - which I normally disagree with, but really compliments the flavor of the beer.  Drinkability - Every element of the flavor and mouthfeel compliment one another. Dry, musty, tart, prickly, spicy: it all adds up to a refreshing and satisfying beer. Truly an original.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Smell: Musty fruit, banana and clove. Hard to describe but dry, musty and tart overall - actually this seems to be the horse blanket smell I have heard described before.  Taste: Very earthy malts with lots of clove and general Belgian funk. A little fruit is present as well. Turns ever-so-slightly bitter and peppery at the end of each sip.  Feel: Very high carbonation, light-medium body, very dry finish.  Drinkability: This and Duvel are by far the best Belgian Ales that fall on the paler side of the spectrum.

37,129,MbpBugeye,3.83,"Something must be said about presentation with this beer. You gotta love custom glass bottles. The label is also unlike anything else in the beer world. Add the unique cap characteristic of Trappist beers and you have one sweet presentation.  Now the appearance of the actual beer. A- Poured into a Chimay chalice. The beer is cloudy and tan. Its like a hue related to sienna. The head is big, billowing and ever lasting. It does fade but it still retains a size thats way bigger than many other beers.  S- Sour grapes are the strongest scent. There are also fruity characteristics found in many trappist tripels. Apple peals, pears, earthy and funky yeast and white pepper.  T- Very different. Sour, but not at all puckering, grapes, apple peals, pears, and white wine.  M- Fruity and dry at the same time. Carbonation is very prickly. The finish is very clean and easy going. The only trace left is a slightly sour aftertaste.

Smells of horse sweat, tart apples, and lemon with a serious undertone of so many smells it will take me a few times to pull them out. With a seriously bubbly mouth feel, it has a nice effect on the belly. First taste to hit the tongue is the sour citrus which you taste almost immediately on the end of your tongue. Tartness that was smelled is picked up from maybe the hops.

Very intense head, like sea foam that just won't go away- I don't mind this, really, but it makes it a little challenging to pour the whole bottle.  Its a shadowy orange color, much lighter than I was expecting but once it opens up and the ""sea foam"" subsides, the smell is delicately spicy, like nuts roasted in butter and coriander.  Orval has a nice maltiness to it that gives it a refreshing, almost biscuity crispness. Hints of lemon, sweet yeast, and white grapes are hiding behind the malt. Very refreshing  In a white trash way, I wish they made this beer in ""affordable"" (I'm talkin $20-$25) 12 packs - even in cans- so us prestigious bastards could easily pick one up and take it to a party, bonfire, or camping because its so easy to drink.

The aroma was of tart cherry floral bouquet, and some funkiness. Taste of light cherry acidicness, funk, and a Belgian yeast breadiness. The mouthfeel was thin, clean, and pillowy.

Plenty of stick-to-the-glass so far. Excellent retention. Very volatile appearance but also very rich and luscious looking. Appearance is hazy with a completely opaque burnt sienna, twenty year old penny color. The head is falling at a ridiculously inconsistent rate, creating lopsided mountains. 5.0 HANDS DOWN.  S & T: The aroma is strong, filled with fruity fermented berries, sweaty socks and spicy phenols. The hops are present on the nose, but are merely ambient at this point. The flavor gets fruitier and spicier and the hops are much more noticeable now, presenting lemony and grassy flavors. Lightly chalky.  M: Heavily carbonated, almost unbearablly so. Lively, prickly, fizzy, a full-bodied mouthfeel that finishes really, REALLY dry. Astringent with an acidic quality. Holy shit. Whether this beer is to your liking or not, there is no debate that the mouthfeel on this sucker is an experience unto itself.  D: Orval's drinkability is low based on it's mouthfeel alone.

The flavor was very much on the hoppy side. The hops are more floral, which to me was more pleasing than other highly hopped beers. Once the beer starts to warm a bit, the malt flavor starts kicking in a bit.  The feel was solid, with a decent amount of carbonation.  Definitely a nice beer, although a bit more hops flavor than I prefer. They floral taste of the hops actually made it nicer to drink than other beers that are high on the hops.

Finishes with a citric bitterness that passes into sour territory as it lingers on the palate. I don't get much from the malt at all - at least I don't think I do, even as it warms.  M: Active but fine carbonation. Light-to-medium in weight.  D: Good.

37,129,FreshHawk,3.95,"A - Hazy light copper orange with a huge frothy, creamy white head. Excellent retention with a good thick lacing left.  S - Complex smell. Good mix of tangy and funky smell. You get a lot of tangy and zesty orange and lemon along with some pear. There is a slight alcohol and winey smell as well. A bit of pepper smell comes out. The Brett funk comes out a lot as well with a bit of horse blanket smell. A good, complex mix of citrus, tangy, sweet, spiced, funky smells.  T - Quite different from the smell. A good amount of medicinal and metallic taste are upfront. There is also a bit of lemony citrus zest along with that. There is a strong funky Brett taste in the background as well. Even fainter is a bit of herbal hops, a bit of pepper, and some white wine like flavors. Interesting and complex, but I didn't find it incredibly enjoyable. I did like it better the more I drank though.  M - Light to medium body with above average carbonation. Fairly creamy but a bit drying at the end.  D - Well the taste was interesting, and I kept wanting to drink more to discover more flavors and get a better handle on the beer. It went down easy and was somewhat refreshing, but the taste wasn't great, and I probably wouldn't drink a number of these in a night.  Notes: Bottled on 06/10/2009. Very interesting beer that is completely different from the other Trappist beers. Definitely had a funky Brett taste, I was just hoping for a bit more fruity taste to go with it.

Fruity smell. There is a lot to the taste. It is very smooth but ""deep"". One taste I can pick out is leather although there is much more there.

Pours a hazy honey/orange with a crazy rush of bubbles coming up from the bottom. Looks almost as effervescent as champagne. A fat three finger white head that rises above the rim of the glass comes from a slow pour. Retention is crazy. One finger head still hanging around after a good 10 minutes.  Smells of funk and sour brett. An estery fruitiness. Smell reminds me a bit of green apples. Pretty sour ones.  The taste is light and fruity (apples and perhaps a hint of ripe berries) with a nice barnyard funk and a sourness that is much more mild than in the smell. A mellow spicy hop presence towards the end as well.  The mouthfeel is light bodied, incredibly creamy from the head that never quits. Very dry with a high level of assertive carbonation. A little bit of a hop bite at the end.  Very drinkable. A superb beer. The first time I had it... totally hated it. That was almost a year ago. Glad I tried it again.

A - Pours a hazy light amber color with lots of yeast suspended throughout (I did not attempt to keep the yeast in the bottle). A finger of dense, whipped creamy, and long lasting head sits forever. No sign of this going away.  S - Ahh, the funky sweet smell of brett...you can smell that from a mile away. Plenty of funk, spices, cloves, horse blankets. Great smelling beer.  T - Funky brett is really up front and in the face - very dry, yeasty and bitter. Horseblanket is high and the bitterness seems more brett derived than hops. Malt character is very light - just a slight hint of bread.  M - Light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. Bitterness and funk fill the mouth entirely. Feel is very dry and crisp, but not quite a refreshing taste.  D - An excellent overall beer, but I think it is this beers weakest aspect. Flavors are intense and very good, but tends more towards a sipper for me. Always glad to revisit this one, though I don't do it often enough. Excellent beer - one bottle in a sitting is perfect for me though.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,pzrhsau,4.53,"Appearance: Nice orangish brown haze from the yeast with a superior head. Smell: Nice fruity scent with a slight tang and a good weight to it from the yeast. Taste: Great fruity undertones of pear and other fruits balanced with the yeast. A latent spiciness that reminds me of gin in the latent flavors. Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Very smooth refreshing beer, not too strong from the alcohol. How can you not love a beer brewed by monks?",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

S- Sweet pears, floral scents, and I can actually smell the sourness.  T- Not as sweet or sour as it smelled. Very light and crisp.  M- Fizzy, dry, and finishes clean with no aftertaste at all.  D- Very easy to drink, the only thing that would stop me from drinking more is the price and a desire for a stronger tasting beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

S: There is a definitive sour smell (reminiscent of a gueuze) with aromas of wild yeasts and floral hops. T: The taste is very flowery and acidic with some sourness; the finish is of dry hops with citrus and spicy notes. M: It feels bubbly, crisp and earthy on the palate. The amount of carbonation makes this taste lighter than I had expected it would.

37,129,augustgarage,3.95,"Poured from its distinctive 330mL bottle into my Trappistes Rochefort goblet. Bottled on July 29th, 2009.  Cloudy butterscotch body with amber highlights and an everlasting, whipped, pearl-tinged head. Heavy, soapy, rocky lacing adorns the sides of the glass. The aromatics are fruity and hoppy at this relatively young stage of the ale's shelf-life. Wildflowers, grass, hints of melon, kiwi, cherimoya, and even quinoa abound.  One of the most unique flavor profiles, which adds to those ingredients in the nose, a hint of chocolate, pale malt, a subtle very dry yeasty character, and a vague suggestion of toast. The finish brings to mind pear skins, white tea, unleavened bread, and a whisper of tonic water. The over all impression is one of corks, cellars, and caves - a sort of musty sophistication that is difficult for me to convey. The character changes significantly as this ale is laid down, so I may add to this review when I crack open an aged example.  Sufficient carbonation, creamy, yet relatively light-bodied despite what it looks like at first glance.  It took me a long time to learn to appreciate this ale, the first several bottles I had, I assumed were ""off"" somehow. The dry, slightly bitter, slightly funky, not quite sour flavor was not at all what I expected from a Trappist brewery (as if they were all the same). Considering the integrity and longevity of this product, I think the deficiency was likely with my palate rather than with Orval - but I still can't help but knock some points off the drinkability scale none the less.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,cld253,4.43,"A- poured from 11.2 oz bottle into a tulip glass. First thing I notice is the incredible, billowing head. Half the glass with all different size bubbles. Pale to medium amber, somewhere in that 7-9 SRM area. Lace everywhere. Some hazing, but I may have poured a little heavy near the end. Still, a 5.  S- Tart and cider like, like an old barn with fresh hay upstairs (modified the brother there talking of a horse blanket, but it's almost spot on for me as well) some citrus and a bit of alcohol present.  T- cider again, tart and some citric bite, changing throughout the mouth-full and swallow, slightly sweet malt comes through, but just for a moment. Dry, earthy finish that lingers.  F- Bit of a carbonation bite upfront that accentuates how dry and crisp this beer really is.  D- I feel like if I had the privilege of more than one of these, they could all disappear very quickly if it were not for wanting to savor them.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Retention is good but as it dies, it leaves behind moderate lacing.  S: So much going on...tartness is the first to hit with green apple undertones, followed by a waft of funkiness. Lemon zest comes in, some floral notes, peppery spice, some sweet green grapes. Every whiff yields a slightly different balance of the components.  T: Starts off with some barnyard funk but quickly moves into yeasty territory along with a slightly wheaty base, followed by tart green apples balanced by a hint of sweetness, along with a bit of citrus and pale grapes. Finishes dry, leaving hints of every component of the taste behind.  M: Light to medium body with moderate carbonation, it glides over the tongue with a few prickles along the way.

37,129,jlapennas,4.68,"Aroma: Tart fruity white wine like aromas dominate. Some flowery notes and something a little rough. Very low barny or funky aromas though they seem to come out more as carbonation dies down.  Appearance: Deep orange, huge rocky head with great lacing. Slight haziness.  Flavor: Fruity, mild tartness, firm hop bitterness and flavor add to an extremely dry finish. Maybe some dry spice notes. Has some qualities that remind me of a tannic English cider. Barny notes are just a whisper rattling around in my nasal cavities.  Mouthfeel: Dry, spritzy, light body but the carbonation makes up for it. Tart acidity.  Overall: Highly complex, lively, dry, very refreshing ale. The tartness isn't outright sour and the many flavors are exceptionally well balanced. I can see wanting to have some of these around at all times. This bottle is about a year old and the emphasis is really the dry fruity acidity and firm bitterness.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

A- Pours a clear, copper/amber color. Produced a massive three fingers width of white, foamy head. Clung to the sides of the glass throughout consumption. Tremendous lacing.  S- Very unique. Has a floral, light citrus aroma going on with tons of earthy funk beneath. Really hard to put a finger on it. The funk underneath is a combination of earth, horse blanket and leather. There is a mild sweetness to boot.  T- Upfront a mild malt sweetness hits the palate followed by earthy tones. The funk is not as forward as the aroma led to believe. In fact, it was quite weird. Almost gave the beer a taste of flat spritzer along with a bit of grassy hay.  M- Well carbonated with a light to medium body. Mouth is left rather dry.  D- I appreciated the uniqueness of this beer, but I couldn't get over how similar it was to old, flat seltzer water.

37,129,Jamison27,3.65,"Poured into an oversized wine glass from a bottle dated 09/2008. I was very excited to try my first Trappist ale after discovering one of my favorite refreshing beers, Hoegaarden. I will say it was not at all what I expected.  A- cloudy, amber / gold. Big head that lasts = I'm talking a caricature of a MONGOLOID.  S- fruit, cider, faint horse blanket  T- tangy, a bit of orange peel, funk became more apparent as this beer warmed. I didn't get any alcohol bite.  M- This is where it went downhill for me. Light, crisp and dry, but overly carbonated. My first impression was, ""This is like champagne!""  D- I couldn't drink more than one of these. The carbonation made me feel bloated with half the glass left. I will age the other bottle I have to see if the carbonation subsides.  Looking forward to trying some other Trappist beers to see how they compare. For now I'm thinking some Lost Abbey with its low carbonation might be my next purchase.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,PEIBeerGuy,4.06,"After seeing the reviews on here, I think I was expecting more than I got. It's a good beer, but it didn't wow me.  Well, the head wowed me. As soon as I popped the cap, it foamed out of the bottle a bit, and I had to pour it in stages. So much head! A very firm, light, creamy head, like beaten egg whites. It does die down, but it takes a few moments. The colour is great. A nice, foggy amber / orange-brown.  Smell is good... pick up some citrus in there... maybe orange or even a little grapefruit... apple. Hint of spice.  The taste is akin to the smell. It's very understated & mellow. I like that, but at the same time, I was hoping for something a bit more distinct.  In the mouth, it's good. Carbonated just enough, smooth and creamy... dry finish.  For a Trappist ale, quite drinkable. It wouldn't be hard to put a few of these away if they were cheaper.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

S: Yeasty bread, over-ripe fruit. Rather complex to say the least. Spices and raisins appear as the beer warms. Then a funk. Wow.  M: Viscous with a tad too much carbonation.  T: Floral hops come to the fore here, sour fruit through the midrange. Funk upsets the balance at the end. Lingering sour aftertaste.  D: Exceptional drink.

Smell is first and foremost reminiscent of a biere de garde, a very fresh, lemon-ish aroma. Beneath the lemon (and possibly lime) there are some other, rather full fruits hiding, green grapes and green apples along with a certain spicyness. Very fresh.  Taste is fresh, and very dry, with lighter than expected hints of citrus and green fruits, with a very light tartness to it all. Finishes up dry and with a slighty tartness and a biterness that fits well, but I'm not too excited about the whole thing, it surely has character, but not really my thing this.

Aroma is lots a overripe fruit (apricot comes to mind). The next few whiffs pull in some nice funky/sour notes and a little horse-blanket.  Taste is a little sweet malty hit, followed by some earthy flavors, sour/barnyard, and a big dry finish that is only very slightly bitter. The finish lasts forever on this one.  Carbonation is a bit too high for my liking, it seems to distract from an otherwise very interesting and unique beer. Other than the carbonation it is a bit closer to medium body, and feels a bit thin a times.  Overall a nice beer, something worth trying, but I would likely spend my $4 on something else. Not bad, I will eventually try again, but not something that I would get on a regular basis. The overdone carbonation is basically what did me in on an otherwise very, very cool beer.

37,129,zoolzoo,3.96,"Bottled in May of 2009, oversized wine glass  I know this one changes quite substantially over time given the brett. I have also heard six months to a year is a sweet spot for Orval, and my review is in reflection of that time frame.  A: Hazy, lighter side of an amber color. Large, fluffy/foamy head. I can already detect alot of carbonation - swish this around and the little bubbles just stick to the sides of the glass before slowly falling back down into the liquid. Ok, this is nice to look at, how does it smell?  S: The first thing im looking for is the brett funk, its there, but doesn't overwhelm. It blends nicely with spice, grass, and light fruity esters. Alot to find if you take your time, I think I was smelling this more than I was sipping it. The aroma is pleasing, but subtle.  T/M: Cloves and a little coriander (I usually hate coriander!), light oranges and lemons, some malt comes through though absent from the nose. Wheres the funk? Its there but I had to search for it. I actually wanted this to be a little more sour or tart. Finish was super dry leaving me with little to savor.  To me, Orval's flavor is a bit subdued. I will attribute that somewhat to the copious amount of champagne like carbonation found in this brew, its a bit distracting. On the other hand, Orval is quite elegant in its subtleness. Its easy to drink; I tasted this from chilled to room temperature and it never got boozy or cloying like some of the other Trappists.  This is a positive review of Orval from someone who really isnt a huge fan of Trappists to begin with. Orval is understated and refined. Certainly not something I want all the time, but enjoyable none the less.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

I'm not sure if my tastes are evolving, but I'm moving through this a lot quicker than I have through other beers of the and similar styles. I can definitely feel the alcohol, but I wish I had more than one of these.  Overall, this lives up to the hype, and it's a great way to cap off my spring break.

Fresh herbs are contrasted by earthy funk. As the beer warms those leathery, wet wool tones overtake the herbal sage.  Very light on the palate, and bone, bone dry. Bitter and acidic on the palate. A little malt through the center provides a nice balance to this complex ale. Citrus and funk combine with bitterness to make this one appetizing brew.

Pours a hazy copper color with sandy head that is comprised of large bubbles. The head fades to a small layer that sticks around for the duration of the beer. Little lacing. Smell is ok, with some clove, cherry, and malty sweetness. The problem with Orval is the way it tastes. It tastes like every time someone at the brewery gets a cut, they save the band-aid for use in the boil with this beer. Seriously the phenol is out of control. I know some people really like that, but I am not a big fan of licking band-aids, especially for the price of this beer. Behind the band-aid, however, there's some nice cherry and citrus notes, along with some nice malt. MF is a little thin and bubbly for me, though not terrible. The phenolic character here is near-impossible to stomach for me, and, as such, drinkability suffers. Stick with St. Bernardus, Duvel, Westy, --I don't care, something other than this.  A-3.5 S-3.5 T-2.5 MF-3.5 D-1.5, Overall 2.9 C  EDIT: That was my first taste of this beer, and I'm almost 100% sure I had a bad bottle because I'm sipping on it again (having avoided it since) and it is nothing like the above description. So here's another go at it:  Pours a pretty copper color with big pillowy white head. The head sticks around for a while, leaving a nice cap on the beer. Laces as it goes as well. Smell is delicious, big tart citrus, some mustiness, some barnyard-y funk, a hint of cherry-like phenol. Very nice, the Brett makes a nice play in this guy.  Taste is what I was afraid of, but this is completely different than last time. None of the band-aid flavor, just a nice pale ale malt base, bready, slightly sweet, underneath some moderately aggressive hopping. A light fruitiness is there in the middle as well. Finish is long and varied between bitter hops, lightly toasted bread, and the yeasty subtle fruitiness. A big surprise, and I am very happy to have revisited it.  On mouthfeel, maybe could use a bit more creaminess to it. Decent body for the style though. Far more drinkable than before, a quite delicious brew, actually.

Also getting a little bit of sourness in the aroma which makes me very nervous about this bottle, may not be as fresh as it chould be.  Taste is light citrus, toasted malts, a tinge of sourness but not as bad as I had expected judging from the aroma. Also has some lemon, coriander spice, and a hoppy character that is present almost the entire way through and finishes very, very dry - one of the driest beers I've had.  Mouthfeel is light, ""airy"" and delicate, the carbonation is ""fluffy"" on the tongue and is slow to dissipate.

Pours with an immense amount of slightly tan head into a chimay glass. Obvious carbonation and the smell is more subdued that i'm expecting. If I had to pick something out it would be some slight citrus, but i come away with a sense of dryness more than anything.  Upon tasting its somewhat hard to describe.... some subdued hops, but mostly a little fruit and a lingering perfume-ish taste. The mouthfeel is continuously foamy, dry, but somehow still relatively light.  While this drinks relatively light, this is not a beer to drink quickly. There is a lot going on and you really have to sip it to get through it enjoyably. As i progress through the glass the perfume aftertaste subsides a little and some hints of sourness come through.  In the end I'm not really sure what to think. This is obviously a beer with a lot going on and one that a lot of effort has gone into. In the world of beer I would classify this as a pretty unique experience... but still I'm not sure there's anything to bring me back to it.

It is not as refreshing as one of the other abbey beers. I gives a strange aftertaste which i can't describe very well in English. It was the same taste like i had with some USA ipa beers.

37,129,BeerNemesis,4.2,"Orval Trappist Ale. 11.2oz. April 2009 vintage.  Appearance: Semi-opaque orange/amber color with some light haze. 2.5 finger white head mushrooms up the glass and settles into a spongy, rocky landscape. Medium lacing.  Aroma: Citrusy, some pine, flower  Taste: It's smooth, crisp, and generally light. Slight tart-fruity flavor with a touch of lemon rind, and some medicinal phenols. The hop bite is not as intense as one would think, but this worked well in conjunction with other flavors.  Mouthfeel & Drinkability: Orval surprisingly accomplishes a light body but a full mouthfeel. Very nice. Carbonation is good (slightly reduced when ages which was quite nice). I find Orval very drinkable (I could have 2-3 more happily). and venerable.  Notes: Orval comes in a unique, vase-like brown bottle. It's unusual, but a pleasing shape nonetheless. Orval also has venerable historic origins -- I mean the monastary dates back to the Merovingian period (1100's).",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,beerdrifter,4.5,"A recent trip to the Kulminator in Antwerp led me to break out an aged Orval from my own cellar. This one was bottled in Nov of 2007 and I've had it aging for almost 2 years.  When I popped the top it immediately overflowed but I only lost a bit. Huge fluffy white head and a cloudy orange amber pour with incredible lacing. Very complex nose with hints of bread dough, perfume, clove, vanilla and oak. The alcohol scent was definitely more pronounced than a typical non-aged Orval.  The taste is also very complex and totally unique. Hints of lemon, vanilla, black pepper, apples, anise, and oak. It's sweet, spicy and sour all at once. Nice dry, bitter hop finish. A bit flat tasting but it's been my experience having drank several aged Belgians that most of them do taste flat. Alcohol is more evident than in the non-aged Orval but still well hidden. Truly one of the great beers of the world. Makes me realize how fortunate I am to have easy access to all I can drink!",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,wescj,4.23,"12oz bottle poured into a chalice.  Looks great. Deep orange and quite cloudy, with a thick and rocky white head. Man, I love big, billowing heads with good retention.  Smells fresh, grassy, a bit citrusy.  Tastes very refreshing, featuring the same notes as the nose along with a good mustyness. A bit light, which fits perfectly with the grassy notes. Good 'n hoppy.  Great mouthfeel, not too light for the style. Everything about this beer comes together very well.

37,129,jrallen34,4.5,"I drank this from a bottle into the orval chalice at the Abbey in Orval.  The beer pours a dark orange with a huge light tan lasting and creamy head. Great retention and lacing.  The aroma is very ipaish with a nice balance of sweetness(grapefruit) and some some hops.  The taste is pretty hoppy throughout even the start which you would think would be sweet. The sweet comes in the middle then is followed by a bitter finish.  The feel is full with a slight dry finish that lasts quite awhile.  Overall, pretty different than most of the trappists but I like it pretty well.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,meeekyh,4.48,"I am re-reviewing this beer from the comfort of my living room as opposed to the hustle and bustle of the Falling Rock.  Tonight I review the beer I got two more of to enjoy tomorrow with turkey and festivities and friends. The unique bottle is attractive and feminine. Bottled on '25/03/2010' and best before '25/03/2015'.  I am using a belled glass with a narrow column at the bottom for the tasting. It is my most commonly used glass and will provide a good baseline comparison.  As I pop the cap in my customary way the sound is crisp and loud. The beer is a light golden color with a yellowish off-white head that is very tall and fluffy. Head sticks around for awhile.  Smells are tart and lactic and incredibly floral. My right nasal passage is somewhat clogged so I am missing some of the complexity, and that is sad.  Flavors are quite complex and I am going to sit and enjoy them a bit and then, maybe, get back to the writing... Spice flavors and a uncanny balance mark this beer. It really outshines most others for depth and drinkability. I love the tiny bubbles and the fact the head is still somewhat present at the end of the glass.  Super good beer and well worth the quest to acquire it.  Re-reviewed Nov 24, 2010  Poured from a 330ml bottle into a Rochefort glass (at Falling Rock Taphouse, Denver)  Really pretty colour, a beautiful golden orange. Head is fluffy, red tinted and tan.  Smells are of the sea, floral, pickles and caramel.  Tastes remind me of wild beers. Tangy, spicy (purple?), bitter hops, and grapefruit. Mouthfeel is light-medium with great big carbonation and a nice dry finish.  Drinkability is great and I am pleased... More Beer like This!  This beer is pretty. Overall the beer is floral, enticing and intoxicating. I am enamored. Happy Valentines day and... Slainte!",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

I'm going to make a concerned effort to try to branch out for my next 200. I figured i'd make my 200th a style of beer of never really tried. That is a beer brewed with the wild yeast Brettanomyces.

Poured into a Golden Monkey Tulip glass.  Watch on the pour because this thing just explodes in the glass. I have about 4 fingers of head to about 2 fingers of beer. The beer is a hazy orange color with some yellow highlights. THe head is almost pure white and its larger bubbles that are disappearing quickly. It sticks to the side of the glass like crazy. The effervescence of this thing is crazy! Bubbles racing to the top of the glass.  This thing smells awesome! Some orange peel scented yeastiness with some clove and orange blossom honey flavor. A small touch of some mustiness.  Flavor is almost identical to the nose. Orange,Yeast, clove. Like i said with the nose, its a bit musty like. I'm guessing thats from the Brett.  Mouthfeel is light, and effervescent. Tons of bubbles tingling every part of my mouth.  This beer is super easy to drink. Most definitely my favorite Belgian, and Trappist beer to date.

At first I can smell yeasty alcohol esters. There is also a hint of lemon/orange peel.  The taste starts up front with a nice kick of hops which transitions into light malt but mostly yeasty mid to aftertaste. It definitely has a good amount of carbonation. As the beer warms, more flavor comes out. A lot of citrus and even some piney flavor in there.  The mouthfeel isn't as full as I would expect. The beer feels pretty crisp with a decent amount of carbonation.  A pretty easy drinker for the most part. I feel as though it would be easy to sit down and drink 4 or 5.

Smell is wonderfully funky, touches of doughy bread, faint citrus and candi sugar. Taste is mild in relation to the scent. Doughy bread throughout backed by touches of funk, lemon, juniper and sugar. Tastes its best as close to room temperature as possible. Medium bodied, dry and fully carbonated to begin, but feels somewhat thin and watery as the glass sits. A very nice beer with many extraordinary qualities, but lacks a little in assertiveness and body.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,MrHassellYaHurd,4.39,"Pours a perfectly transparent copper-orange. Thick three-finger head supported by a rush of carbonation.  Smells of hard candies with just a hint of dusty yeast. Dried apricots and other fruity notes. I can't exactly pick them out, but it gives a sense of subdued or understated sweetness.  The taste carries a zesty orange peel/ tart bitterness of green apple. The big malty grain flavors balance nicely against the acidic fruity qualities. The nearly 7% alcohol is nearly undetectable, and makes the brew all the more pleasant, if not deceitful.  The Orval has a spot on middle of the road medium body, just right IMO and really compliments the gentle tastes. Carbonation is certainly vigorous, but just feels ""right"" with this particular beer.  Overall, the Orval is superbly drinkable, and only the price could stop me from consuming several in a night.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Typical belgian yeast scents paired with apples, pale malts, dried raisins and candi sugar.

Poured into a tulip glass the beer was a beautiful clear orange blonde color with noticeable effervescence. Nice off white head that dissipated quickly with no lacing. Slight hop aroma on the nose but that was about all I got. On first taste I got, beer, decent beer, but nothing near the complexities others have talked about. The beer wasn't, bad, just not as good as I was expecting. Maybe a product of over hyping?

An initial clean finish with a sneaky aftertaste that kept the hops close to my conscience. Poured a yellow-gold, with yeast for cloud cover.

I successfully avoided pouring a significant amount of sediment/yeast into my glass.  A: Orval pours as a lively, rocky, but soft-looking head that hangs on until my glass is empty. Once the head subsides a bit, a clear, pale gold beer is revealed.  S: Lemon, grape skins and an undercurrent of horsey funkiness tease the nose.  T: Subtle, but complicated. Lemon, again, but joined with a tartness of green apples. Hint of black pepper, too. Brettanomyces reveals itself in the finish, which is horsey and earthy and very long and dry.

I've had this bottle sitting around for a while, waiting for a good moment to finally try it. Martha Choakley screwing the pooch seems like as good a time as any. It was bottled on 07/05/07, and is ""best by"" 07/05/12.  It poured a hazy yellow gold into the oversized wine glass. It was a cautious pour, but the head was still way over the top, literally. Gigantic, white and foamy, like laundry detergent.  The smell is very sour and tart. That belgian yeast doing its thing. I'm getting a lot of apple, some grape, and a definite pepper undercurrent. The taste is similar, but it works even better on the tongue. Sweet and tart and extremely dry. If I'd already had a few, you could possibly convince me it was some wonderful white wine.  The mouthfeel is light, and the carbonation is tight and sharp, again, almost wine-like. Already mentioned the super dry finish.

Pours a slightly murky amber color with a quickly billowing off-white head. Even into a Duvel tulip it takes a little bit of time to pour. Huge creamy head that eventually settles to a rocky, uneven lace with a big dollop in the middle and splashes of stick all over the sides.  Smell immediately greets me with a big dose of funk. It's tart and funky, with a musty horse leather sort of quality to it as well. As I get deeper into it there is some fruity and woody dry hop character.  Taste is not as funky as the smell, but does have some light tartness and some barnyard character. Has a leathery and musty quality to it, which together are probably the most persistent flavors. Also some peppery spiciness. There is some dry hop flavor in the finish; it's woody and earthy.  Mouthfeel is quite crisp and dry, with a very clean finish. Medium bodied.  This is a very good beer with a lot of interesting characteristics. The brett does some nice things for this beer, and it's quite complex. Despite the complexities however it ends up feeling just a tad bland. All of the flavors are somewhat subtle; the funk for instance was more pronounced in the nose. Not quite a great beer in my book, but certainly a very good one.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Beer is copper/gold in color, hazy, and envelopes the glass with a large head which recedes rather quickly, leaving moderate lacing in its place. Foam is large-bubbled and almost soapy in appearance. Carbonation is moderate to high.  Smell: Smell is quite pungent, with a good deal of spiciness and yeast shining through. Also, there is an underlying sour fruit aroma like lemon zest that is noticeable. Some hops also present.  Taste: The flavor was what was expected following the smell of the beer. The initial taste was sour and spicy and rather dry. The body was fairly light and reminded me of hard cider. There is a great yeasty flavor on the back-end, and it finishes with a slight musky taste.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth and light-bodied. With the amount of carbonation and bitter/sour flavor, I could have used a bit more punch from the body, but it is certainly refreshing.  Drinkability: Very drinkable and smooth. The lingering dryness leaves me wanting more!  All in all, I think the word here is unique. It was my first Trappist Ale, and it was definitely worth the experience. The flavor seemed to grow and gain complexity as the beer warmed, so I think I would recommend leaving this one out of the fridge for a while before enjoying.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Pepper, anise and cut grass are out front. They're joined by a powerful sourdough aroma. Mixed in is what I would best describe as a barnyard earthiness. There's even a light pear fruitiness to be had.  T: Fruity, spicy and sour all at the same time. Pepper and anise bitterness, plus funky sourdough flavors dominate. Malt is almost hay like. A pale fruit sweetness is at work too. Finishes tart, spicy and dry.  M: The medium body is slightly grainy. Carbonation is vigorous, yet soft.  D: Orval is a beer to approach with an open mind.

Beer is medium to light bodied, has a minor forward character and a sour / musky late and aftertaste. This beer is one of a kind but the my first impressions on taste were not that great. Time for taste two, sour and bitter duke it out on this beer and it finishes a little dry.

37,129,eduardolinhalis,4.7,"330ml bottle served in a chalice.  A: Beautiful bottle and art. Pours a hazy amber to chestnut color, firming a huge yellow to beige head that dissipates slowly leaving many lacings around. A small layer persists and some particles can be seen floating around  S: Sweet, malty and ""biscuity"". Fruity (reminded me pears and apples). Acid (orange zest). Fresh and grassy hops and the traditional Belgium yeasts the end  T: Distinct and complex as the nose. Sweet caramel upfront but very dry, in overall, bit acid and quite bitter end. Caramel malts. White grapes, apples, notes of wood, nuts, yeasts and finally the hops  M: Medium body and high carbonation. Dry and bitter aftertaste  O: Excellent drinkability.

37,129,Mora2000,4.32,Pours murky orange with a large white head. The aroma is lemon with some brett-funk. The flavor is quite a bit of citrus as well as some funk. The finish is quite a bit of hop bitterness. Medium mouthfeel and high carbonation. This is a very unique beer that everyone that is into craft beer should seek out and try.,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,ThaCreep,4.62,"The nose is quite sweet, raised with yeast slightly acidic. In the mouth, we feel the bitterness of these yeasts (which is not unlike the lambics), and coupled with aromatic hops, the body becomes elusive. The finish is hoppy bitterness and acid sticking to the palace, leaving all the flavor of the beverage spread to the buds.  But most of all its obvious advantages, the Orval is a beer that changes gradually as time passes (the alcohol level is changing quickly), making each taste a new discovery. A unique beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Durge,4.15,"This is a very lively brew showing a hazy deep amber color with a giant golden head with lots of gobby lacing. The aroma is sweet banana malt and lemon herbal hop, very delightful and complex. The taste brings an odd lemon malt blend that immediately grows on you if that makes sense. It has a soft corriander butterscotch blend with a spicey and very tart finish that shows some melon subtleties. The feel is a smooth mid-body with plenty of spritz. It's reasonably drinkable and a very unique option for refreshment and flavor. Pretty good stuff.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Mavajo,4.03,"Pours a bright yellow-orange with a fluffy, frothy white head. Good retention and generous lacing. Aroma is a mix of light fruits and Belgian yeast, with a lemony-zest undertone. The aroma seems to be a good omen of what's to come, but the taste just doesn't quite deliver, in my opinion. There's a nice blend of light fruits, lemon and white grapes with the typical Belgian yeast notes - but it's all a bit subdued. There's minimal aftertaste, which is always great in my book, but the overall taste just doesn't impress like I feel it should. Dry crisp finish with generous carbonation and a fairly light body. Drinkability is decent - there's nothing offensive here to slow you down, but I just wasn't particularly wow'd either.  In short, the beer does pretty much everything right and doesn't offend in any way...but the total package is somewhat unremarkable, in my opinion. It's missing that proverbial ""je ne sais pas."" Regardless, it's a good brew - just doesn't bring the ""wow"" factor.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Lacing almost covers the inside of the glass.  S - Lemon-citrus scent right off the bat with a strong yeasty nose. A hint of wood and something else I can't put my finger on.  T - Mildly bitter with a hoppy citrus aftertaste. Very dry finish. I was little disappointed at the taste after such a beautiful pour. The sweetness of the malt comes through a little after it warms. It's very unique, like nothing I've ever tasted.  M - Highly carbonated and rich, but not too thick.  D - I didn't dislike this beer, but I don't think I would drink another one.  After seeing how highly this beer was rated I was disappointed after I got my hands on it. It's not a bad beer by any means, but it doesn't particularly suit my tastes.

37,129,mklinger,4.42,"Poured into a goblet. A very thick, rocky head formed. There's an effervescence about this beer that is very pretty in the pour. The beer pours a pale orange amber. I did my best to get a clean pour but it came out pretty hazy. It's an interesting, complex looking beer.  Aroma was great. i got some lemon & herbs right away followed quickly by a bit of the barnyard aroma that folks talk about as wet horse blanket. Again, this is just such a complex aroma profile.  Taste is complex too, though I didn't find that it held up quite as well as the aroma (but it was close). More of the barnyard in my taste profile, not as much bitterness as I thought there might be. Good bit of sourness, too. Quite tart.  Rich mouthfeel. The carbonation lends a fullness to this beer that is otherwise greater than the body. Quite nice.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,MOB210SA,4.28,"One of the hugest expanding heads I ever came across, even for a Belgian. The head is a pillowy landscape of cloud like forms, dense and lush looking. Very bubbly with carbonation. Somewhat clouded with yeast, which with Orval I think doesn't take away from it. So, I wasn't too careful with the pour. Reddish, burnt copper orange in color. Head finally fell to a dense pillowy blanket, That stays the entire duration of the glass, and probably would stay alive all night.  Mellow spices, some clove, and familiar Belgium yeastiness. Somewhat dry, lightly bitter finish.  Taste is clove spice and a light fruitiness. Somewhat phenolic qualities in the taste and nose.  Medium bodied with great carbonation, crisp tasty finish and light on the tongue.  Great drinkability, this beer is delicious, balanced great, and is so easy to drink it practically disappears.

S - Muscat grapes and lemon. Some acidity here as well. If this beer tastes half as good as it smells it'll be delicious.  T - A nice lemony flavor up front with some funky barnyard here too. Some medicinal phenols. Not too much hop bitterness, as would be expected since this puppy is almost 2 years old. Will let this one warm up to see what other flavors poke their head out. Some pale malt in the aftertaste.  M - Medium bodied with great carbonation. Dry finish.  D - Drinks nicely. A solid brett beer with some good flavors.

37,129,jbonapar,3.88,"First time finding an Orval, the last of the Easier to get Trappists I have yet to try. Looking forward to this as I actually had to drive to Quebec to find it!  Appearance - Poured a copperish color with dark, slightly off black pieces of yeast in the bottom of the glass.  Smell - Floral, bitter medicinal. Strange, different for sure.  Taste - Hmmm. Let me think...Bitter, somewhat offputting to me. I've had a number of sips, its not too warm, not too cold, i just find this hard to drink. There is a almost moldy flavor to it. Do I have a bad bottle? I don't believe people would rate a beer like this so highly. I honestly can't finish this beer.  Mouthfeel - nice carbonation with fine bubbles, but the mold is putting me off.  UPDATE: Tried again after 2 years of becomming more experienced in beer, particularly Saisons and more ""funky"" beer.  In hindsight, i am enjoying this. The bitterness is pleasing now. I understand the slightly chalky, dampness and its actually very enjoyable. I'm proud that I've developed a palate for beers like this. I think its a beer that people can like after you've experimented with different styles. I can now see why people love this beer. A true experience for sure.  Probably one of the first time I've ever poured out a ""high quality"" beer. I'm not sure if this is gone bad, i find it hard to believe this is the taste people are raving about.  Perhaps I'll have to try again sometime, but i have to be honest.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Errto,4.77,"Bottle purchased at Amity Wine. Bottled 5/08/2009 which puts it right in the 6-12 month sweet spot (unless that means it was brewed in August???)  Pours a rather pale gold color, long lasting head, good carbonation, slightly cloudy.  Usually I don't detect much in the smell of beers at all, which is part of why I don't review much. But this has an incredible flowery, sweet smell that is hard to resist.  The taste is unlike any beer I've had (yet). Hop bitterness is definitely there, more so than in other Belgians I've had, and it's got that rich sweet thing going on, but it's also a touch sour towards the end, enough to notice but not enough to be squirm-inducing.  Mouthfeel is surprisingly light considering the taste, kind of nice. Plenty of carbonation to keep the senses tingled.  Drinkability: well, as a pale ale at less than 7%, yeah, it's pretty damn drinkable. I'd drink another right now if I had one.  Overall, I'm extremely glad I finally got to try this. I get the impression from here on BA that there really aren't other beers like Orval, which is a shame because I'd seek them out.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

A: This beer poured a nice muddy tan, with some nice head that seems to have some staying power, which has given some nice lacing.  S: The smell was slightly citrus and hops, but wasn't overwhelming.  T: The taste was outstanding, and a little bit on the alcohol side.  M: The beer felt fairly watery, and not what I was expecting.  D: I'd rate this higher if it wasn't for the mouthfeel that I got, overall it's a decent beer, but slightly disappointed in the actual feel.  I'd recommend this one to any body.

It is beautiful but anything looks cool in that Belgian style Glassware. S: Citric and a little Cindery T: This is a different taste; there is fruitiness and some spiciness. It is very complex some how with out being overpowering, the alcohol comes through in the flavor as well as the carbonation. M: The carbonation is there in the mouth feel, Dryer than I would have expected.

Lots of visible carbonation  S: Sweet fruit, like kiwi, but not over the top. Definitely a floral presence as well  T: Light tasting sour apple. Toasted wheat accompanies this with some bitterness and maybe even a little pepper. There's lots of flavor here, some of which I can't quite get at  M: Light bodied with a good amount of carbonation (as the appearance would suggest). Dry, slightly tart finish  D: Very easy to drink.

So it starts very dry lemon and orange, with a bit of hops and juniper and lots of brett in the front end. The sweet candy sugar is there but its just barely, its so well balanced with brett yeast its heaven in glass. the hops are sharp but well in balance.  M: Dry and medium body, great after taste. Smooth and crisp  D: geez this is the great beer to drink straight up or with food and/or cheese its just out of this world. I can never drink just one and even at 5 bucks a pop I always buy 6.

37,129,Pahn,4.68,"11.2 oz bottle into Duvel tulip.  Appearance: Huge, pillowy white head despite a slow, careful pour. Head sticks around forever, ending up as a dollop of uneven foam with about a 1/4 inch thick head remaining around it. The extensive lacing clings to the glass forming a web. The beer is a deep, rather opaque amber with a few stray bubbles. One of the most beautiful and inviting looking beers I've ever seen.  Smell: Grassy, with a hint of lemon and a mild belgian yeasty funk. The smell exploded out of the bottle as soon as the bottle opener cracked the cap, and stayed nice and strong throughout.  Taste: So deep. Every sip yields an entirely new experience, and always unlike any other beer. I got grassy notes, black pepper, a nice hoppy bite, floral notes, leather. The finish is alternately soapy and tart, or big and bready, occasionally even sweet. Lots of musty tones, again reminding me of the smell of leather or even cologne. It's such a strange tasting beer, and the taste never mellows out or stops delivering new experiences.  Feel: Perfection. Creamy with just the right amount of carbonation.  Drinkability: Also excellent, primarily because of the exceptional mouthfeel, and also because the taste never stops growing. The alcohol is quite well masked as well, though it does occasionally provide some pleasant warmth.  Probably the most interesting beer I've ever tasted. There are many beers whose taste I prefer, but very few that get anywhere near the complexity of Orval (Trappistes Rochefort 10 is the only one I can think of, though I haven't been able to get my hands on any Westvleteren yet).  Note: absolutely do not drink this beer too cold. You may as well not drink it at all if you're not going to have it warm enough to unleash all its complexity. Definitely a beer that every beer drinker--regardless of preferred style--should try at least once.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,TheJollyHop,4.04,"Bottled on 4/29/09  Well finally I got around to tasting this ""world class"" Belgian trappist brew. Let me start out by saying it lived up to the hype, albeit not completely however.  What a beautiful appearance! Very luxurious frothy head with a steady stream of carbonation. Pours a dark amber/ light brown and there is generous lacing on the tulip glass. This is exactly the appearance I look for when it comes to drinking a fine Belgian ale. It is entices you with the promises of immediate enjoyment at hand, literally speaking.  Now the aroma was somewhat lacking. Some herbal notes and faint sweet and sour funkiness comes through, but overall there are no stand outs and the aroma as a whole is very light. While this is most likely a testament to the high degree of balance this beer has, it just doesn't quite do it for me.  The taste is a very complex mix of subtle overtones, with a pronounced bitterness that is far from harsh. The Brett funk is distinct with some detectable biscuit malt and very faint tart fruit (possibly cherries?). There is some nice alcohol warming and indeed, like the label states, a long and dry finish.  This beer certainly lives up to the hype when it comes to the mouthfeel. Amazingly soft and creamy. Its highly carbonated body feels pillowy on the tongue. Almost as if the beer just is absorbed into the ether after making contact with the tongue. Quite the experience.  While it is a most complex and highly balanced beer, I would not consider having another in any particular session. The beer definitely held my interest in trying to decipher its complexities further, but after one my desire was extinguished. However a positive feeling the beer imparted lingered on... I like to consider this beer as a Belgian take on a bitter ale with a purposeful eye on balance.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,AlexMunse,4.55,"I saw this beer earlier tonight on the shelf and have enjoyed Trappist ales before, so I thought I'd give it a go. The guy at the beer store also told me I should try it and I value his opinion.  I'm pouring at 50 degrees into an 11oz snifter.  It pours a light amber/dark peach color with a bit of cloudyness to it. It looks like a beer I would enjoy just from the color. I've got about a two finger head which is very frothy and thick.  It smells almost sweet, as I've come to expect from Trappist beers, but not so sweet as other beers I've tried (Lindemans). The smell has a lot of complexity, but I can't really pinpoint any one aspect that stands out. I do, however, notice a distinct absence of an alcohol smell, which I appreciate.  The taste is very light and refreshing with, as I said about the smell, a lot of complexity. There isn't an overpowering taste of anything but hops. It's mild, but almost fruity. Oranges or lemons, I can't tell.  I would buy this beer again, the taste and price are right for what I got. I am fully satisfied and would love to share this with friends.

T: Tons of complexity and yet easy to drink. I get spice in the back of my palate, and some nice fruity esters in the front. There is some aloe like qualities going on as well.

A thick, pillowy and foamy white head sits a top the ale and just stays stationary. No dissipation whatsoever after the initial pour. Reminds me of the Duvel, so lovely. The lacing is fantastic as well - huge clouds of bubbles sticking to the glass. The smell is Belgian yeast, lemon zest, green apple tartness and a touch of pear. Very fruity in scent with just a tad bit of sour funkiness.  Wow, the taste is full of fresh apples and subtle hints of lemon. Very light and refreshing actually. Great balance of sweet and sour. Not so much of a bready taste to the brew, which was a bit surprising, but not essential to its flavor. I can discern a slight Brett funk - not as potent as a gueuze or lambic - and a bit of dryness and tartness towards the aftertaste. This tastes more like a mini gueuze, rather than a pale ale, as there was no discernible hop bitterness.  Very light-bodied and generously carbonated. Crisp and clean the whole way through.

I wonder how this biter-sour game will evolve with aging.  High carbonation produces bubbly sensation yet the beer remains somewhat creamy. Light medium bodied.  A particular brew that you'll never get tired of.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Shiredave,4.3,"* Vintage Review best before date 22-6-2010 Poured at cellar temp  This beer billowed a foamy head that the Duvel glass could barely contain as I gently poured down the side of the glass. Strong sour notes wafted to my nose - sharp rotting apples with hints of lemon zest, yeasty esters and candied grain. The head was fizzy with a clotted peak rising from the middle -effusive carbonation streaming from the bottom etch and visible the the hazy orange / gold liquid.  The sour brett aromas linger as I sip - some oxidation is evident but overshadowed by the malt flavor and tart bite from the carbonation. Sourish flavors Ive experienced with fresher bottles is only on the fringe - surprising hop flavors - stale and dry blend with the sugary grain taste - mellowed and balanced more than I remember.  Light medium body this is very drinkable and enjoyable - sharp sour flavors pleasantly coat my mouth and compliment the firm hop bittering at the finish. Abrupt finish to the liquid but the complex flavors and sour notes linger with lip smacking satisfaction .  A truly fine crafted Ale from those crazy Trappist dudes.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,gfreed,4.01,"Had a bottle in Brussels at Mokafe in the Arcade du Roi, with a ham and cheese sandwich and a small salad. Rich, ruby-red color with a dense white head that took at least five minutes to dissolve enough so I could get to the beer underneath. Nice. Lace everywhere. Surprisingly light aroma, but that was deceptive: there was a nice malty hit in the first taste and ever-so-little bite at the back. Tight, fizzy bubbles and a light texture-- lighter than I expected based on the color. Easy to drink, and the 6.9 ABV doesn't hit hard.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,sanjosey19,3.85,"Poured into North Coast goblet. Very thick and cloudy. Orangish in color. Created a very thick, two finger head. I actually liked the smell quite a bit, kind of a fruity citrus mixed with a bit of straw. Very dry mouthfeel, a little high on the carbonation for my taste. Slight hoppiness up front, a little bit of funkiness, nice and sweet. Very drinkable, I actually felt like the beer got better the more I had. All in all, a very good Belgian Pale, very unique citrusy flavor. Not my favorite style, but definitely one of the best, if not the best, of it's style.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,davod23,4.38,"Feeling contemplative tonight, so I thought I would see what the monks are up to. Orval. IMO, the most unique of the Trappist ales. Poured from the bottle into my Orval chalice. Score.  Popping the cap resulted in a good amount of beer over my countertop. Damn, that was a quick boilover.  Appearance is a slightly murky orange-yellow color, with a billowing white head that subsides to a thin cap. Just a little lacing.  Smell is good, but not great. It's got the funky Brett barnyard characteristics, maybe a touch of citrus, and yeast. It's pretty understated though, and I have had Belgian pales with a bit more on the nose.  Taste is what I come for for this brew. Funk, yeast, lemon, a hint of orange zest. Very nice, very distinctive. A long lasting yeasty finish, very dry. Perhaps the driest beer I've had.  Mouthfeel is fantastic. It's very highly carbonated, so it's light and fizzy on the palate. Although I tend to like styles that are bigger and lower-carbonated, the mouthfeel is perfect for this brew.  Drinkability: I could drink this all night. And I just might.  An excellent beer. Those monks know what they're doing.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,woosterbill,4.13,"11.2 oz bottle into a snifter.  A: Clear bright orange body topped by a finger of dense white head (lots of foam for such a wide glass); incredible retention, although not much lace. After finally subsiding, the head easily reasserts itself upon a solid swirl of the snifter. Beautiful beer.  S: Dry, floral, yeasty, grassy, bitter. Distinctively Bretty. Complex and nuanced, but surprisingly understated.  T: Largely follows the nose, with fresh herbal qualities in the forefront, followed by a wave of Brett and (later on, at least), a bit of ever-so-slightly-sweet biscuity malt. Supremely dry finish, by far the driest of any beer I've ever had. Very interesting, and quite tasty, but the aridity of the finish sucks all the flavor out of the beer - until the next sip, that is.  M: Light and lively, with loads of fine bubbles; becomes smoother and more tongue-coating as it warms.  D: I sipped on this for quite a while, but definitely could have gone through it more quickly and hand another one or two. The bone-dry finish makes another sip almost a necessity.  Notes: I was excited to see that this showed up on the Union League Cafe's limited (but excellent) beer list, and at less than a 100% markup (unlike the 200%+ on domestic craft). I'd never had Orval before, but knew what to expect from having read reviews. It didn't disappoint, but it certainly didn't blow me away, either. Definitely in a class by itself as far as my experience of Trappist brews can tell, but its distinctiveness seemed to be its biggest strength. On the Trappist side I'd rather have any of the Rochefort or Chimay offerings, and on the bretty side I'd rather have a Wild Devil. Still, a classic beer and one that I'm very happy both to have tried and to have enjoyed.  Cheers!",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,DannyS,3.78,"A - Pours a medium brownish red orange with a giant pillow of frothy, loose foam that settles into a half-inch layer. Lacing is thick and webby.  S - Phew! Thick lambic/saison funk with astringent citrus and a touch of floral hops. This one lays the funk on thick!  T - Dry, astringent, somewhat bitter, and grassy. A very earthy brew with a vegetal punch. Finishes surprisingly clean with little to no aftertaste.  M - High carbonation and medium body. Basic, but what I'd expect from a beer.  D - This one's got a tad of a bite to it, as the ABV is a little high and the flavor is pretty bright and in your face, but it's still very drinkable for it's properties.  Overall - Drinks like a cross between a lambic and a saison with some pale ale thrown in. Sounds a little discordant, but it works.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,hardy008,4.08,"Cloudy amber color with a huge off white head with excellent retention. After I poured some of this into my glass, I had to wait a long time before I could pour out the rest of the bottle. There were huge bubbles with lots of sticky lacing. Wow. The smell has horse blanket, lemon and floral hops. The taste has lemon peeling and bitter florals hops, some of the horse blanket I noticed, and some grass. This is bitter, but not overwhelmingly bitter.  A lot of carbonation, dry, light to medium bodied and complex. Nice to drink, a bit tart, and there is also a hint of sweetness. Well worth trying, and having again.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,flagmantho,4.03,"Poured from 11.2oz bottle into a tulip. Label indicates this was bottled on 9/23/2008.  Appearance: beer was extremely foamy when poured (1 finger of beer, 5 fingers of foam). Color is a slightly cloudy attractive cidery hue. As I drink it, huge globules of foam cling preposterously to the sides of the glass. Awesome!  Smell: slightly tart malt with hops both earthy and metallic. Not what I was expecting, but interesting.  Taste: surprisingly tart, astringent and bitter. There is a little sweetness to the malt but plenty of earthy and metallic hops balance that out; there is even a little floral character there at the end. There is even a little chalky flavor, which I like ... a very complex beer.  Mouthfeel: as might be expected from the head, this is an extremely heavily carbonated beer, and I enjoy the creamy texture said carbonation imbues.  Drinkability: this stuff is pretty good, although it may be a little too flavorful and complex to really session.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,sisuspeed,3.88,"Poured this into an over sized red wine glass. A fairly gentle pour still produces a huge bubbly white head. The hue is a hazy orange/red amber.  The nose contains rich candied syrups. Fruits like cherries and grapes. A nice malt base as well.  Before getting through to any significant taste, my mouth is flooded with an all out carbonation assault. Once getting past the carbonation I can taste cherries surrounded by a vinous character. There is also a syrupy sweetness that mixes with an unknown source of bitterness and finally a bit of alcohol on the finish.  The mouthfeel is very carbonated, but the body is good for a Belgian Pale Ale. The drinkability is also pretty good, minus the onslaught of carbonation.  Overall, this is a tasty Belgian Pale Ale. I would pick this up again, but if the carbonation level is this high in all Orval beers, then I'll probably pass. Just too much to make it enjoyable.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,abuliarose,3.61,"Poured into a bulbous wine glass to a thick (very, very thick), active cream head over clear amber body. Did I mention how huge the head was? It dies down fairly quickly, though. Smells nice but not overly strong and of estery orange blossom and a little grape. There's a slight floral hop aroma and a little must, but we'll leave it at that.  Tastes like carbonation. After that, a little like apple juice with a metallic tang. There's something very funky mixed in there as well. The ending flavors are citrus sour with tinges of hoppy bitterness. It's... different than the other Belgian pales I've had. This one's got more real farm funk to it.  Mouthfeel is carbonation, basically, but once you're past that it's a fairly light-bodied and smooth beer. The carbonation makes this one a little too hard to drink for me. On the plus side, it bubbles nicely.  All in all, an interesting offering. Would I pick it again over other Trappists? Probably not. But I can appreciate where it's coming from.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Appearance: Pours a deep, murky orange with a massive three-finger head that takes its sweet time before allowing me to get a decent amount of liquid in the glass.  Smell: Smells of orange peel, spices, cloves, yeast and bananas. Pretty intriguing.  Taste: Tastes of spices, apples and yeast, with some cloves and bananas. Has a lot of a weissen feel to it, with a touch of funk.  Mouthfeel: Very crisp and dry with just the right amount of carbonation. Very good.  Drinkabillity: This is probably one of the lesser trappist ales in terms of alcohol content but I still wouldn't drink a lot of these in one sitting.  Overall, this is a pretty interesting beer. Not as complex as other trappists, but pretty unique, so it's definitely worth a try.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

I received a good solid pour of almost entirely head. This beer has lips like a porn star. Amazing head.  A - Letting it sit for a good 3-5 minutes and the head had finally calmed down enough to finish my pour. It leaves an amazing lace inside the glass. Very attractive beer. Nice golden/amber color, steady steam of bubbles supporting the ridiculous foamy mass on top.  S - Lots of spice, and apples. Hint of cherry in there somewhere? Slightly earthy, with some dried fruits in the back there behind the mountain of apples. Definitely a bit of sweetness in the nose.  T - grassy, apples, pepper, hint of hoppiness. Very dry. Bit of alcohol warmth. Yeast is in there as well. I don't normally enjoy beers this dry, but it's not bad at all.  M - Crispy, good carbonation, medium body, very dry.  D - For 6.9, I could see this being fairly drinkable if I was more into how dry the beer is. What can I say? I have a sweet tooth.  Overall, not too bad.

Similar to a fruit scented soap or perfume.  Complex and boozy fruit. Apple cider, citrus zest, champagne, green tea and moderate hoppiness, but lacking in much sweetness. Very unique.  About medium bodied. Some harshness in the carbonation that gets better as it warms up. Nice and smooth on the palate with an extremely dry finish.  Nice drinkability.

But complementing are ripe fruit flavours and a slight citrusy twang. But, in the end, the bitterness is embodying every other flavour within it  M : Very dry feel, moderate carbonation.

37,129,Ek0nomik,4.19,"Poured In: Tulip Glass Purchased At: Cannery Wine & Spirits (Sun Prairie, WI)  Appearance: Good golly miss Molly. I poured this conservatively, and I'm sitting at 3 inches of head and a half inch of liquid. Poured a cloudy light copper and orange color with quite a bit of frothy head. A generous amount of lacing is on the side of my tulip. Quite the effervescent beer, a thick stream of bubbles are rising to the top of my glass producing more head. It's slowly dieing down... time to indulge.  Smell: The nose reveals dried lemon, white grapes and to my surprise, I can pick out the perfume smelling hops. I didn't think I'd notice that in this, but it's definitely there. Oh, and yeah, there it is, some barnyard funk. Not a lot, but after giving the glass a few swirls it's starting to leak out.  Taste: First up is some pale malt, not surprising. Bitter on the tongue, I suppose from the higher than expected hops that were added to this beer. Hops are never a bad thing. The hops aren't bringing out any citrus notes though, at least I don't think so. No, the tasting seems to be more powered by the yeast. Some more grape, a dash of lemon, and a little bit of leather.  Mouthfeel: I wasn't expecting hop oils to be running along my teeth, but there they are. It's quite pleasant. A medium bodied beer, highly carbonated, but it goes down easy.  Drinkability: Not a high ABV, easy to drink, and a nice variety of flavors. A well put together beer worthy of being tasted by any craft beer drinker. The price isn't terrible, but it's not great either.

This is an 11.2 oz/33cl bottle (bottled on 23/09/2008, so just over a year old), poured to an Orval goblet.  A: Others may claim to compare, but there is quite simply none other than an Orval when it comes to the appearance. Massive head, a flocculant 2+ fingers of ivory. It would easily crest the glass if not for its solid, tight-spun foam. A honey-amber beneath that ridiculous cap, a light haze and plenty of tiny bubbles wriggling from the etched base. Lace coats the entire glass in a complete sheet, thicker foam sticks in bands.  S: Hay-like grassiness and flowery honey rise from the glass, a captivating 'brett' yeastiness balances. Sneaking sweetness approaches then regresses: dried cherries, candied apples, cinnamon, apricots.  T: Nuances abound: grassy grain, peach cobbler, baked apples, cracked pepper, ripe pears, tart cherries, mint sprigs. Ends with a dusty dryness, an almost brutal mineral flavor, but sugars still jockey for position to the end.  M: Clean and crisp effervescence, smooth carbonation, delicate feel, maybe on the thin side if we're looking for 'faults'. Light-medium body, long mineral-dry finish.  D: Epitomizes the Belgian Pale style for me: crisp, yeasty dryness, 'rustic' flavor, bountiful aroma, and, oh, that look.

As the head fades it leaves a sticky lacing on the sides of the glass. The body is a hazy amber/orange with a nice glow around the edges.  The smell is a slightly spicy and grassy hop accompanied by a nice graham cracker sweetness. There is also nice underlying scent of tart apple cider.  The taste flavors follow the smell very closely. The grassy hop characters are joined by a nice lemon zest. The hop characters fade to an earthiness that is washed away by a quick light sweet taste of graham cracker.

I bought it warm and let it chill but maybe not long enough as the lightweight, cottony foamy head was about three inches thick on top of the glass. Still it poured a nice copper color with plenty of lacing and rather cloudy. The aroma was comforting with its milder sweet malt and light hop mixture. A full bodied mouthfeel.

37,129,FernMaster,4.18,"Poured from a bottle into my Boulevard Goblet. I've seen this beer before and I've always been meaning to try it but I never did until I heard that Orval and Boulevard were doing a collaboration together. The pour from the Orval yielded more head than my goblet normally allows. Almost a full five fingers worth! The head was a nice white color and the beer is a sort of murky gold. The smell is really sweet, I really like it. It smells almost like a lambic, with the hint of fruits. Maybe some banana, mixed berries, a hint of raspberry and something else I can't quite identify. I took a couple of drinks before writing this, but before I get to taste I must commend the beer on lacing this goblet. This goblet eats all sorts of foam from any beer, yet Orval prevails over it - it must be a sign that their collaboration will be a success. The feel of the beer is almost dry, like a pale ale. The taste is really unique however, the scent of the beer is backed up in the taste, the banana, raspberry, malts and others and it's slightly sour, yet slightly sweet. It's different and tasty; I could definitely drink a couple of these in a night if it wasn't for the almost five dollar price tag.

Bright golden amber in color with a nig head of white on top that only slowly faded as the session wore on, dropping tons of lace up and down the sides of the glass. Richness to it that looked just fantastic as it warms up. Aroma of light fruit touches, hints of a light grassy touches, maybe pine. Apples and grape skin start to come to the front as it warms up and it gets a very complex touch to it. Smooth, even flavor here, really quite wonderful. Light and airy on the palate, the carbonation is spot on. Light touches of apples and bananas, hints of light peach and a delicate touch of grape are all coming out at me. Nice bready and grainy touch to it now as well, really again very well done. I was quite impressed with just how flavorful this was. Nice dry finish capped it off quite well and left a near spot on aftertaste.   Overall cannot believe I let this one go so long. Cannot believe it as it is such a top not offering.

37,129,Reaper16,4.28,"This is my 100th review... again. I already did my 100th review (Arrogant Bastard from Stone) but it became my 98th review overnight as the Great Database Error of 2009 ate my reviews for Stone Ruination and Allagash Odyssey. So... cheers for me reaching the 100th review milestone for the second time this week!  11.2oz. bottle (dated 9/23/08) served into a globe glass  Pours a lemon/orange sun-kissed dark yellow. Its very much in between yellow and orange. The head... wow. Forget the finger scale, Orval pours a greater than one HAND sized white head. Large bubbles mixed with small and oh, so creamy looking at the top. The lacing is all over the place, notches of sporadic sea foam splashed all over the glass. This is the kind of appearance that photographers would do nasty things to achieve. It looks like the Platonic form of beer itself. I have to say that this beer was very difficult to pour. It was explosive out of the bottle, ala Duvel. The foam is so spectacular that there were notches of lacing IN THE BOTTLE.  Aromas of sweet, ripe bananas hit first. Its a very juicy banana smell that is completely unlike the banana of a hefewiezen, say. Golden delicious apple and white grape bolster the yeasty fruitiness. Actually, it can't all be yeast fruitiness; some of it is coming from lupulin. There is a kiss of pine to go along with the other hop flavors. Mild funk from the Brett does wonderful things here. Strands (not the best word but its what comes to mind) of sourness serve to highlight the inherent qualities of the fruit aromas, while fleeting ghosts of horseblanket ground everything in this lovely farm sort of context. All of the aromas in Orval work together to tell a story, which is amazing to me. The malt is sort of lost in all of the yeast aromas, but I can forgive that.  The base of the flavor comes from the pale malts and the pale ale-level of hoppiness. Drying, piny flavors cover the mouth only to give way to developing flavors of banana and white grape from the nose. The Brett ensures that everything is tart and suitably sour. Its not funky on the palate, but the Brett is appreciated just the same. Its hard to pin this beer down. Its very complex and it happens to be almost completely unique, especially amongst its Trappist brethren.  The mouthfeel is too watery for me. I think a little more substance in the body would carry the flavors better. This beer is certainly drinkable enough; its an expensive session candidate but a couple of bottles paired with a dish of pork with seasonal vegetables would be exquisite.  This is a very unique beer; direct comparisons are nearly impossible. I did recently review a beer that comes close though -- Goose Island's Sofie. I don't know why I'm sharing that information. Back on track: this beer is complex, drying yet refreshing, worthy of universal praise. Everyone should have this at least once.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Not my favorite trappist, but really, really good nonetheless.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,CrazyDavros,3.7,"Pours orange with a ridiculously large head. Lots of great lacing! Big brett aroma of lemon, orange, elderberry, apple and musty horse-blanket. More like a lambic. First up upon tasting is sweet caramel malt, with some faint tart orange tang before a pithy bitterness cuts through. Hints of banana in there somewhere. Good light body with a refreshing carbonation.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,juju7,4.43,"What a brew. Haven't had it or a while so it was great revisiting tonight. That complexity on the nose of brett, pine, potpourri, barnyard is quite unique. To then deliver something tart, slightly sour yet so palatable is pretty special. It looks great too, radiant orange with a billowing head. Fairly low carbonation and a finish that doesn't give up. This is top shelf stuff.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,PartyBear,4.03,"Obviously a classic and respected Trappist ale, I've had this a number of times in the past, and figured it was time to offer my opinion.  Appearance: Reddish amber going on auburn, with a mountainous foamy head with superb retention. Lots and lots of carbonation.  Aroma: Sharp, sour and acidic. Lots of citric fruit in there, lemons, oranges, limes, incredibly zesty. There is a hint of ginger, pepper, and yeast. Some cinnamon, and a light underlying caramel. There is more with every sniff.  Taste: Plenty of sourness, and yeasty acid. Lemons, orange peel, and sour cherries. There is a distinctive pepperiness about the flavours, which adds to the powerful dryness. There is a base sweetness there that all everything is built on, caramel, aged honey, and a mild toffee.  Mouthfeel: Very lively in the mouth, dry, and rough.  Drinkability: Orval's taste is unique, the original and unreplicated. It's another one of those beers that you really have to have tried at least once in your life.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Docer,4,"- Slightly cloudy orange/yellow... lots of fluffy white head... had to wait often for it to settle in between pours. Always left a fine layer of light foam. Bubbly...  - Light sourness.. ester, and mild bready yeast.... little bit of funk... but none overpowering.  - Sour up front... almost like apple, or a cider. After the sour funk goes by, it is way more tame and mild than I expected.. very tasty and light. Hides any alcohol it may have very well.  - Little mouth watering, overall so smooth the mouthfeel is rather mild and absent.  - Very drinkable, and a fantastic imported style all in its own. Would certainly buy it again.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,indiapaleale,4.35,"Bottled on 9/25/07  Orval pours a very bright, hazy orange. Lots of bubble action, I'm guessing two years of bottle fermenting has upped the carbonation levels a bit. The head is big and thick and creamy, the Belgian's are masters at that art. Looks beautiful.  Wow, the aroma is a ton of the sour, bitter, funky Brettanomyces. Its like sour cherry almost. There is also a bit of that musty, farmhouse sort of smell going on. If you're not into these sorts of smells, just give it some time. A two-year old bottle of Orval is heavenly.  First sip and its clear that this beer has changed and become an entirely new beast. The mouthfeel is a bit more mellow and smooth, lots of earthy flavors and of course the funk from the Brett. Lots of sour notes on the tongue that bounce around with the carbonation. Pretty incredible how much this beer has changed and how well it holds up. The bottle itself shows an ""expiration"" date as being in 2012!  Amazing stuff, not sure for how much longer I'd want to cellar a bottle of Orval. It must hit a peak before the flavor profile really mellows and it becomes somewhat bland and musty tasting. I'm happy I gave this bottle a nice second birthday party.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

All over the board. Spice, funk, fruit. It is killer with thinly slice provolone cheese.  M - Medium body, more than enough carb. Decent coat.  D - Too much crazy beer. Exhausting.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,ludachris,4.18,"Bottled 03/09/2008  Pours a brilliant marmalade hue that seems to have somewhat of a glow to it. A massive 3 and a half finger billowing, thick, chunky, creamy, slightly off white head top the beer after a gentle pour, coming to a rocky peek in the centre of the glass. Chunky, sticky lacing coat the sides.  Smell of sour white grapes almost salty in nature, chewy raison, biscuity malt, spice, banana and fruity esters. Incredibly complex.  Green grapes make quite an appearance in the taste along with fruity esters, green apple, sweet malts, biscuit, hints of citrus and a peppery dry finish. 6.9 ABV is well hidden.  Smooth and refreshingly crisp. I think it could have been made a tad more full in the body but nothing to complain about.  Overall, an EXCELLENT brew. By far one of the most complex beers I've had to date. Took me about 4 or 5 mouthfulls before I pegged down what I could in the taste. Things seemed to just keep popping up. The head seemed to rival Duvel, but paired with the magnificent orange hue, the appearance is unparalleled to anything else I've ever had. Highly recommended and would gladly buy another.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Lldeegan,3.81,"This beer poured beautifully. Their was a giant rocky pure white head that emerged when poured into an oversized wine glass that made it look very appealing. The smell was nice, corriander, yeasty, reminded me immediately of Chimay White. Because of the fruity yeast notes. A bit more of a sour smell to it than the Chimay though, reminded me of the Cantillion Classic Gueuze I just tried. The taste was very interesting, at first I was very surprised at how high of a rating it had. The carbonation was too high for me and it attacked my taste buds to the point where it just was like seltzer water, once this subsided I did notice a very complex taste that I began to enjoy more as I drank and as the beer warmed. The smell is fantastic, but the carbontation (perhaps badly handled bottle) masks in the taste what the smell offeres initially, until it opens up after the bubbles dissipate. Sour apple, bubblegum, white grape, and a bitter bread towards the end. The mouthfeel is what really ruined an otherwise great complex beer for me. I may be wrong, but the early sips are way too carbonated, as the beer settles, it becomes more enjoyable, but the first sip, which is always my favorite, challenged my taste buds. I could keep drinking more than one of these, they have a good taste, as long as it settles before it hits my tongue. However, Does not compete with my favorite Trappist, Chimay White.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Aroma - Strong bready malts - Spices are up front - coriander, ginger....  Taste - Coriander and spices up front. Strong malt and baked bread presence. Alcohol slightly detectable..  Mouthfeel - Dry with a bite....nice.  Overall an excellent Trappist. I prefer the Farmhouse Saison when going Belgian, but I'll do this again....",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,bobjonesSD,4.27,"Picked up this bottle from OTM in OB. Poured into a Maredsous chalice. Massive, beautiful lacey head from the pour, hangs around forever and leaves a lovely lace on the edge of the glass. As soon as I popped the top of the bottle I was met with the amazing sweet, sour yeasty aroma with lots of esters, one of the most appetizing smelling beers I've tried. The taste is complex and interesting with a lot of flavors from the brettanomyces coming through - leather, horsey on top of the blondey belgiany base. Really an enjoyable beer, definitely going to try again. This bottle was about 9 months from the bottling date.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,bgjohnston,4.5,"Having enjoyed most of the wild ales I have tried recently, I decided to try an authentic original.  Pours with a massive white head that stays around for a while with good carbonation. The beer itself is a cloudy orange color. Smell is subtle, yet distinctive; you get some sense for the funkiness right upfront, yet there is a lot going on.  Taste is tart and funky, but not at all overwheming. Nice dry finish with each sip. One can imagine sipping more than one after it is all gone.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,bulletrain76,5,"Re-rerate: Four and a half month old bottle. Stunning. The last few bottles have proven this to be a truly perfect beer. There is so much variety depending on age, but that makes me love it even more as it can be multiple beers for multiple moods while still being outstanding in every iteration. The hops and fruity esters are phenomenal in younger examples, with brett and dry elegance taking over as time progresses. This truly is a perfect five, and it is a tragedy that it's not appreciated enough to land in the top 100 when it makes the vast majority of the beers on the list look sloppy and poor.  Re-rate, 11/26/07. I've finally come around to re-rating this almost three months later, and Systemblaget still has bottles bottled on the same day, so I'm getting a sample with 9 months of age instead of 6. It may be that the beer has evolved considerably in those three months, or it may be that I have evolved as well since one of my first ratings, but this rating experience is very different from the original. The pour is a clear orange/amber with an absolutely massive lasting head. Bubbles stream from everywhere to sustain the mountainous foam for quite some time, until you wear it into a creamy layer that laces all the way to the bottom. Beautiful to say the least. The aroma is a little different than I remember: dryer and much more complex. Yeast, sour fruit, hops, bubble-gum ,and cloves hit you to start. Very spicy cloves. As the beer warms, more sugar comes out, with some caramel and a good helping of sweet cherries with a lingering acidity. The flavor is dryer than I recall; much dryer than the aroma would lead you to believe. Hop resin scrapes your tongue with a lasting bitter finish, and a slight citrus acidity rides over it all. The body is light and heavily but smoothly carbonated, with a long bitter and lean finish. the alcohol taste that was present before is completely absent now. I'm awe-struck at the complexity of this beer. I didn't know that you could smell so many amazing things in one glass. It's like a whole table of spiced christmas confections, and I'm loving it. It's leanness and dryness also make it supremely drinkable, which is more than I can say for any other Trappist ale that I've had.  (original rating) From a bottle in Lund, Sweden on 8-28-07. Pours a murky golden orange amber with a substatial head that stays for quite awhile in a tulip glass. The aroma is probably one of the best-sweet apricots linger with tangy lemon and spicy cinnamon. I was expecting a better flavor out of this, but something was lacking. There was a good mouthfeel with heavy carbonation, but an intrusiveness of alcohol lingered over it and ruined the flavor. The bitterness in the finish was definitely refreshing, but for a beer bottled at only 6.2% ABV, there shouldn't have been this prevalent of an alcohol taste. I'll definitely give it another try.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,HumanCarBomb,3.88,"~ Purchased this bottle at Shoreline Beverage in Huntington, NY. Pours a hazy orange color with a huge frothy head. There is a ton of bubbles in this brew. Hints of fruits and spices graze the nose quite well. The taste is complex, and the finish is bitter. Orval is definitely a superior beer when compared to most, but I am sorry to say it is my least favorite of the Trappist offerings. ~  PS- it is worthy to note, this was bottled on 04/22/09, so I will let my other bottles age for while, then revisit this one at a later date.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,popery,4.62,"An exceptional, unique beer. The beer pours a beautiful shade of burnt orange-amber, medium, with a slight haze. The head is white and rocky and dissipates at a medium pace. The aroma is exquisite. The sour barnyard funk is just precisely right and blends wonderfully with the underlying Belgian ale notes. One of my favorite aspects of Orval is the perfect dryness. This nature even comes through in the aroma. There are fruit notes, apricots, grapes, lemons, figs, and earthy complexity. The flavor is just wonderful. I'm a bit of a sucker for a dry, delicious beer, and Orval pulls this off this combination better than nearly any other. The flavor is somewhere between a gueuze and a Belgian ale. Orval makes me imagine how good Belgian-style ales must have tasted before modernity imposed sanitary conditions and end of the sour beer as the norm. Orval is a world classic and everyone should try it. I will be buying some bottles for the cellar soon and look forward to witnessing this beer's maturation.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

S - Super complex smell of malt, hops, banana, clove, maybe cider, and other spicey phenols.  T - Great balanced taste. Very mild sweetness at first, then progesses towards a nice warming of spices complimenting hop finish. Very toasty biscuit flavor from the malts. Almost a pear-like fruitiness and peppery spice.

S- If you read through my reviews, I am not a big smeller. I get more aroma from the actual drink than I do sticking my nose in there. T- Great carbonated lemon zesty flavor that is great. Did I mention it was great? Very well balanced and not at all too sweet like any of the other Trappist. M- Smooth, slight yeast aftertaste that goes with the territory.

Under all that head, smell is pungeant with notes of apple, bruised pear, dried leaves, and grass.  Taste is cider-like with notes of apple, vinegar, mint, and a grassy, grapefruit-juice bitterness in the finish. I'm impressed with the slightly wild but very refined flavors. Mouthfeel is well-carbonated and appropriately thin without being watery. Just a tremendous beer, well worth the price.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,zdk9,4.08,"A- This one foams like the ocean out of the bottle; takes me a while to pour. The color is a dark cloudy orange, though it's brown out of the light. Lacing is a little hard to tell through all the foam but it looks like there's some.  S- Delicious cider notes. Touches of lighter malt. And perhaps some yeast spiciness- pepper? The smell doesn't smack you in the face, but the cider is pleasant enough.  T- A stronger taste than the smell definitely. And more complex too. Spices- sort of pepper and cardamom. Bitterness on the outsides of the tongue. Nice cider vinegar bordering on malt vinegar too.  M- This beer reminds me a lot of JP stuff, particularly the Bam Noire (gee I wonder why), but here's the big difference. This one is thinner on the palate and with more lingering bitterness, that makes it taste more like beers I'm used to.  D- Very good.

Vague spice, very slight grassiness. Some orange rind.  T/M - Very light, frothy feel with a flavor that creeps up on you. Dry earthy hops flavor hits first, but it dissolves into a bitter fruit flavor. Has a quality not unlike a good white wine on the back end. I want to say there's a white grape flavor in there as well. It's tremendously complex, but too wine-like for my liking.  D - Very wine-like.

Tremendous action in the glass and moderate lacing as tbe beer goes down.  The aroma is also fantastic, a wonderful bouquet of fruits and grains. I smell green apple, blueberries and grapes mixed with the grassy Belgian style yeast. Very strong aroma.  This has one of the best flavors I've experienced in a dry beer. Tiny bit of sweetness mixed with grape and blueberry flavors. Lots of grass and earth flavor in and good balance with the bittering in the finish. Sharp almost to the point of being salty.  Huge carbonation on this one; I thought it was high enough to detract from the mouth feel and drinkability. It was very spicy, sharp, and filling.

Smell: Freah green fruit and Belgian Yeast.  Taste: Opens withe a graininess which is slighty off putting. There is a green apple sourness from the middle to the end and just before the finish there is a bitterness which was quite un-enjoyable. There was a distinct bitter and earthy aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Light bodied and crisp with moderate carbonation.  Drinkability: I first had this in a bottle and tasted much like rusty pipe water and was a drain pour. I figured I had a bad bottle considering the reviews on BA, so I thought I should give this another chance and to my surprise I did not find this to be enjoyable seeing that I personally started my craft beer journey with the Trappist selection and have enjoyed the majority of the 7 seven trappist breweries.

37,129,crossovert,4.34,"Orval, my 4th Trappist brewery tasted (5th if you count St. Bernardus), comes in a 11.2 fluid ounce brown, mini 750ml Belgian/French styled/shaped bottle with a trout holding a ring in its mouth on the label. Bottled on 22/01/2009, best before 22/2014. Definitely when I find this a little cheaper at Discount Liquor in Milwaukee I will buy a few to cellar. This bottle is lightly chilled.  This is a fizzer, pours (sediment and all) unlimited off-white head with large bubbles into my Duvel glass. The head recedes fairly quickly leaving huge lumps of lacing behind. not the best looking Trappist ale. The beer itself is a hazy oranginsh brown, caramel colored almost. I've heard with a sediment free pour this is actually a very clear brew.  Smell is the best I've encountered with a Trappist ale. It has a potent farmhouse saison style scent with some fruity sourness, a nice dose of yeast twang, some tropical fruit, white raisin, lemons, and a hint of spice. A very exotic smell, and a good one indeed.  Taste carries over with all the above scents as flavors, and more. It seems even fruitier and more saison-like, tart with a tad bit of cloying bittersweetness in the finish, the cloying taste lasts only the first sip. The spices and yeast are a bit more pronounced in the taste as well. It has a slightly bitter aftertaste with a hint of sour green apple and a bit of hops. It is smooth drinking with the right amount of carbonation, a bit of wateriness mid-drink, and a dry finish. It is whole heartedly complex in taste, scent, and mouthfeel; the appearance seems to be the least flashy/unique attribute to this beer.  The alcohol is hidden pretty well, you get hints of it here and there but nothing overpowering. It warms slightly as it goes. Nothing that would prevent me form at least having another despite the 6.9%abv.  Overall this is a fine Trappist ale, not the pinnacle but on the upper tier. It is the most unique and possibly the most complex one I have had so far. This is also beer #250 tasted for me, hoorah.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,TheycallmeTim,4.48,"Poured from an 11.2 oz. bottle into an Ommegang chalice.  A--Pillowy white two finger head that holds maybe a quarter-inch for the entire tasting. Screw Belgian curtains--my glass has Belgian DRAPES when I was done! Unbelievable retention. Body was a light amber, with orange undertones but mostly a ruddy auburn.  S--Spicy, with highlights of clove and cinnamon, backed by a hint of mustiness and rounded out by liquor splashed orange rind. Total yeast/ester masterpiece here, as the monks have teased out an incredibly complicated mixture of aromas. Very tempting to get rhapsodic with this brew. But I will resist.  T--Mystifies in its complexity--got a brandy/armagnac thing going on without the cloying booziness. Just a wet dark fruit skin pungency. There's also a taste I can only describe as the contents of the cheesecloth you use to make hot apple cider. All those heavier flavors, though, are buoyed by the bright, tight spinning bitter flourish of the hop finish--reminiscent of a pilsner in its crisp bowing out. Super snappy, super refreshing given the brick heaviness of the opening flavors. Whole spectrum of beer possibility is represented here.  M&D--Effervescent, champagne-like. Very bright and bubbly. Thinnish, but in a welcome way that makes you want another sip. Not a sipping beer, though, I don't think. I actually drink a few of those happily due to the welcome final hoppiness.  This beer just tastes like an accomplishment. Incredible. So glad Trader Joe's was selling them at 2 bucks a bottle in the middle of Brooklyn.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

The funkiness is apparent in the flavor also. It's not a bad flavor, just a little twang. This beer really does have a great unique flavor. Some bready flavor, some spice, a little cork/wood (which is weird since there is no cork) and some fruitiness. The alcohol flavor is there too, but doesn't take away from any flavors.

As it warms, the clove becomes stronger and the hops are a bit more noticeable as well.  The taste is spicy, and almost peppery. There is a definite presence of pepper. There is a bitterness on the back of the tongue but everything seems to smooth out as it warms. Spices become more present but are also more mellow.  The mouthfeel is creamy and carbonated. This does not stick around in my mouth and is very refreshing.  A very good beer. I like the bitterness that it has.

Huge rocky head with lots of brussels lace. Very very nice.  3- Smell- Subtley tart apple notes, heavy yeast smells- a bit earthy. Faint cloves. smell isn't too impressive to me- just average.  2.5- Taste- I'm sorry to say that I found this a bit bland. Tried with and without yeast and not much changed. Some fruityness... I guess this just isn't for me.  2.5- Mouthfeel- Good initial texture, but aftertaste is long and overly dry in my opinion.  2.5- Drinkablity- A very good looking beer that I had high hopes for, but it let me down.

Revisit Time Details- Bottled 11/13/2008, Served on 8/26/2009  5- Appearance- This time served in a chalice. Appearance is still right on que with initial impressions.  4.5- Smell- Tart apples, horse/barnyard smells, cloves, medicinal notes, lemon, very floral.  3- Taste- Oddly enough my first few sips of this did not seem very flavorfull, just as I thought before. After that however, the beer seemed to come to life for me. It is slightly tart and has a lemon-rind like bitterness going at the same time. Flavor of hay vies for alot of attention. Seems a bit salty, and finishes very dry with a rubberband-like quality which is more tolerable than I thought it could be. This is certainly a complex beer- there is no denying that. The flavor profile isn't completely for me, but I liked it a lot more this time around than the 1st time.  2.5- Mouthfeel- Dry, dry, dry with ample carbonation.  3- Drinkability- I don't think that this is for most beer drinkers. This one definitely takes some time to get used to and to learn to appreciate it. I'd like to have a bunch more of this to see if I really like it or not after some more time with it.

Immediately I perceive pears in the taste, I think partly from the strong nose. This quickly developed into more tropical fruit-type flavors of pineapple or P.O.G. juice. There's definitely citrus (lemon-rinds?) and spice (cardamom? cloves?) with a firm hop bitterness in the background, maybe some medicinal phenols. I reeally like the dryness of the finish and the way these flavors lingered.  Very effervescent.  This beer blew my mind-hole. Me and my partner both thought this was the most stand-out beer we'd ever had.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,jgasparine,4.21,"Sample from bottle; bottled on 1/22/09  A- Poured carefully from bottle to yield a huge foamy, well-retained, cream colored head. As I refilled the glass throughout the sampling, the head became less foamy and a lot more rocky (proteinaceous). Lovely lacing throughout. The body was a hazy copper color, with lots of active carbonation visible from the sides and top of the glass.  S- HORSEBLANKET! Horseblankety caramel malt combines with some spicy vinous notes on the nose. The spiciness reminds me a bit of chai tea. Further examination reveals subtle hints of lemongrass, stale hops and sour cherries on the nose.  T- Earthy, leathery tobacco and horseblanket dominate the palate (pediococcus and brett)... these characteristic almost completely mask the underlying crackerlike malt flavors and stale hops bitterness. The finish is exceptionally long/lingering... dry, earthy, horseblankety and somewhat medicinal. An exceptionally complex taste!!  M- Medium body... somewhat viscous, but not what I would call 'oily' or 'creamy'... very well attenuated and surprisingly less carbonation than anticipated. I feel like the mouthfeel is the only relatively weak area of this beer.  D- I would definitely take a second bottle if one were available... don't know if I would consume more than two in a sitting though... ultimately I'd say this is very drinkable for a beer of this strength and complexity.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,STEG,3.91,Pours a large head with a very nice dark honey/amber color to it. Wonderful shimmering lacing all the way down the glass.  Smells sweet with a notable vanilla and caramel scent. As you get down further you can begin to smell an almost herbal tea like aroma.  Taste is fruity with a baked bread like aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is dry and heavily carbonated. Very little alcohol presence.  This is very drinkable but I don't think I would want more than one and I'm not sure why?,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Jmoore50,3.93,"Just because I was extremely curious.  What a good looking beer. It has a great golden color, and pours a nice two finger head. The head retention on this is ridiculous! Just fat fat gobs of lacing on the sides, the head just is a gelatin.  The smell is very good also. Orange citrus is a great characteristic in the smell, as well as a mellow hop aroma. A 'Trappist Yeast' aroma is present as well. This is my way of describing the bread malt smell is this mirrored in the flavor.  The taste is just so so. It has a very very light pale ale flavor. Nothing really stands out. Good carbonation and mouthfeel, the orange tangerine sweetness coming from the hops is nice. Just a slight hint of bread malt, something I usually do not care for. This is super drinkable, just a session beer at its best. I just drank the whole glass in the review. I think the drinkability is so high is because of the flavors are mellow, not offensive. I hate the term but 'well balanced' would be a term used to describe this.  Overall good, did not impress, however can understand the love that people have for this beer.  J",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Evocatus,4.8,"Looks like a cider with a slightly light orange hue; the lead was a light beige and foamy. Smelled like a bunch of sweet apples. Taste was a good mix of sweet and bitter. The apple taste from the aroma was there as well as hints of bread and citrus. Going down you could taste something earthy, can't really think of another description. Mouthfeel was pretty good; right amount of thickness and carbonation, and the head just added to that. Goes down pretty easily. Overall a good combination of flavors, smell, and alcohol level, easily drinkable on any occasion.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,BeanBone,4.15,"Appearance: A hazy, honey-orange body underneath a mountain of creamy, off-white head. The head eventually starts to fade and leaves good lacing on the way down.  Aroma: In my mind, I had constructed an idea of what people were talking about when they said Brett beers have barnyardy and goaty character, but the reality is a whole different story. The reality is much more literal than I had ever imagined; this really does smell like a goat barn. Truly bizarre, and yet deeply intriguing. It's not all livestock though, as there are lemony, grassy, and earthy notes to accompany everything.  Taste: A completely unique mix of spicy (fennel and licorice perhaps), musty, sour, bitter, funky, savory, and earthy tones. There's still plenty of barnyard here, but it's morphed a bit, becoming much more mellow in the process. The aftertaste is full of grassy bitterness and a dash of assorted spice. Wow, I've never even dreamed of a beer like this.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and perhaps a little over-carbonated for my tastes. A dry finish.  Drinkability: The glass went back slowly, but much of that could be due to how utterly different this bee is, it simply demands your attention.  Verdict: Orval is a thoroughly unique experience, and one I'm to glad to have finally experienced. I've heard people refer to this beer as a challenge, and I can certainly see why, but it's a challenge worth taking (at least once).",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,thepeter,4.53,"A- beautiful orange bit of haze and the most wonderful frothy pillowy head that you can imagine that VERY SLOWLY turns to some really nice lacing.  S - Brett, sweet sour fruit, funk and a small shovel full of dirt.  T - Very well balanced tart and hoppy to begin with. Gets down to EARTH towards the end. Musty, earthy with a hint of funk and a clean aftertaste.  M -good carbonation, goes down smooth but not exceptionally.  D - I could drink this all night. the bitterness and funk and Earthiness all, remarkably, leave the palate fresh and clean for the next taste of what ever you are having. FANTASTIC!",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,JEdmund,4.85,"Appearance Pours out with an aggressive head, so a gentle pour is necessary; not quite able to get the whole bottle into the Orval chalice; color is dark, turbid brown--not the most appealing color, but the amazingly whipped head that sits there complacently is very impressive.  Smell I really love the smell; tart, like sour apples, a bit woodsy, a bit sugary, and just a bit musty (but nothing off-putting like horse blanket); really, it's hard to put into words.  Taste & Mouthfeel Still as impressive as the fist time I had it; there's just a lot to enjoy here, all delivered in a subtle and intriguing way; profile starts off with the most delicious and smooth bread-like flavors and just a tiny, tiny hint of brown sugar, which is then cut back with a pronounced tartness that then drops off to a bone dry finish; the body is extremely light and airy, with the classic Belgian level of carbonation (high); overall the flavor and body seem so delicate it's really hard to believe it packs 6.9% ABV.  Overall I think Orval is something really special in the beer world. It's the ultimate in refined craftsmanship; it's overall delicious and packed with nuances to be discovered; as well, it's light and incredibly drinkable. I would drink this all the time if it were more affordable, so, as it is, I will put Orval on a high pedestal and enjoy it on special occasions.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Xziz,4.88,"This is my first review and I really shouldn't put it so far at the top of the scale... but... this ale is simply wonderful.

I highly recommend it.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,prosper,4.27,"Bottled 07-03-07 - three-ish years in the bottle.  Pours a hazy gold with a thick white head and lots of co2 streamers. Some lace, but the head is kinda coarse.  Smell - wow, uh, funky. Tart pineapple, acidic fruits. Maybe some light musty cheese. Some herbal character - hops I guess, but they're lost in the huge not-so-subtle blast of smells.  Taste is very good. Lots of different flavours, but they blend well, none overpowering the others. Lots of earthy musty character - damp malts and such. Fruity, but not as intense as most other belgians; same for the phenols - light spice, but supportive and not centre stage. Clean, dry finish.  Mouthfeel is light - lots of carbonation and crisp dry finish help here.  Light (relatively speaking) alcohol, dry body, spritzy carbonation - yep, it's quite drinkeable",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,JBogan,4.23,"Pours an amber/peach color with a huge foamy crown which stays around forever and leaves large amounts of sticky suds clinging to the glass. An exceptional looking beer.  Smells very fruity, with pears, apricot and spices playing the leading parts.  Tastes much as it smells, along with a mustiness which mutes the fruits somewhat. A hint of alcohol in there as well. Good tasting but not quite up the the level the aroma promises.  Mouthfeel was very prickly and dry. A nice crispness is felt in the mouth and on the way down.  This trappist brew has a quite different character from other trappists. While not my favorite beer of this style, it is one I will be revisiting again in the future.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,gyllstromk,3.6,"A compelling aroma with telltale leather from the Bretts, which hints of great, sour things. Reminiscent of a tart lambic or flanders red. The flavor which follows leaves much to be desired. It's thin, likely over-attenuated from the Brett. Not much perceptible sourness and the Brett flavors (leather and barnyard) are less apparent than in the nose.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Graham5161986,4.79,"This brew pours a quite brilliant cloudy, orange/amber colour (when held up to light) and exhibits a bubbly, frothy off-white head with good retention and leaves some decent patchy lacing. Aromas of fresh apple, pear, citrus, pepper and spice all touched off with a hint of caramel arise from this beer. As it warms, I am able to detect a bit of salty cured meat as well (it brings prosciutto wrapped cantaloupe to mind). Taste is quite yeast and fruity up front yet very dry and it displays a bitterness from the hops that I have not come across in a Trappist so far. With those hops come along some nice citrusy and even some coriander notes like from a good wheat ale. The spice lasts through the finish and on to the linger with a dryness that is all too refreshing (especially for a Trappist ale). Mouthfeel is champagne like, medium bodied but with a ton of prickly bubbles that tickle the taste buds and leave my mouth watering after its bone-dry, peppery finish. Overall, this ia an achievement of a beer. So complex on the palate and so refreshing - not to mention, its relatively low ABV (for a Trappist, that is) makes it quite drinkable indeed. I have always enjoyed this beer and I will be enjoying it for a long time to come.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,kbutler1,4.45,"Orval bottle with bottled on date of 24/04/2007, best before 24/04/2012. Poured into a duvel tulip glass. Pours a huge pillowy offwhite head that slowly retreats. Color is a red tan hue. Smells of tart fruit and the belgian yeast. Taste is very smooth and lighter than I would have expected. The carbonation bubbles all around your mouth. Slight bite on the tongue is the first flavor I pick up followed by the taste of fruit. Finishes with a slight bitterness. I was looking forward to trying this after reading all the good reviews. My only negative is that I wish it had a little heavier mouthfeel to it.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,vrazionale,4.45,"The signature 11.2 oz. bottle at refrigerator temperature poured into a snifter. Bottled on 13/11/2008.  A - Pours a thick (3 finger!) creamy white head that backs down to a thin layer across the top of the brew. Body is a slightly ruddy hazy brown color.  S - Horseblanket funk, tart citrus fruit, sage, mushrooms, sea salt minerality, old wood, musty basement. Funky notes step up the most here. I find it difficult to qualify the nose to the extent that it deserves, but suffice it to say that it's beautiful and enticing and unique.  T - Crisp and tart with a well-crafted balance between hoppy pungency and funky yeast action. Mushroomy, musty, herbal, and dirty (in a good way). Completely unique flavor profile. So incredibly refreshing.  M - Good carbonation that acts as a palate cleanser for the next delicious sip. Doesn't feel at all heavy, even considering the indescribably complex flavor profile.  D - What a remarkable brew! I love the musty, dank, minerally flavors here. This brew would pair so well with food (cheese especially!) - ceviche, an aged natural-rind goat's milk cheese, or fried fish tacos.

S: definitely has a Belgian aroma to it such as banana brown sugar and slight coriander. T: has a definite pale ale taste but does not taste anything like it smells. It is a model beer for a Belgian pale ale. Flowery hops and flavorful yeast and caramel malts gives it a rounded out flavorful taste and a long lasting aftertaste. M/D: the carbonation is quite heavy and the brew is heavy as well with slight bitterness on the tongue.

S- I can smell the brett for sure. Very potent and strong smelling. There is also a great fruity smell to it as well.  T- The sour taste is great, very satisfying.

D- Very easy to drink, and very refreshing.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,ecoastman,3.9,Drinkability - Easy too drink and unique but not my favourite. I will buy another trappist instead but might try again during a tasting with friends. Not sure if it's the beer or the Indian food I had a couple of hours ago but the acidity might be giving me slight heartburn.  Appearance - hazy golden straw colour with a nice rocky head to start which recedes to a uniform thin layer. Not much lacing.  Smell - mildly malty sweet with herbal perfume and spice. Very unique. Has a bit of a funky dank smell but I like the funk.  Taste - like the smell but is a little less complex than I expected. What's that spice...cardamom? Maybe it's just cloves combined with citrus... Lichee? What the hell do I know? I don't even have a glass beside my name on this site and probably haven't even earned the right to pick up a bottle of this stuff. All I know is that this beer is very different.  A light metallic taste in the dry finish but a good beer for interest sake. Maybe I'm drinking this one a little too cold.  (10 minutes later) Nope - even when it warms up it still isn't my favorite. I think I'm going to be at the lower range of the average scores on this well ranked beer. I'll reluctantly give it a 4 for it's uniqueness.  Maybe fresh is better? Bottled 03/09/2008 - so either March or September if you know the European dating system... that reminds me - we need a world dictator. This is July 26/09.  Mouthfeel - light watery body and smooth.

Taste: So different, spicy, peppery, good, all mixing together, really unique ale.  Mouth: Good body and strong carbonation, crisp mouth feel.

37,129,rustrose,3.4,"Orval Trappist Ale Bottled June 5 2008 Sampled July 24, 2009  Big hiss on opening but no foaming up in bottle. Pours a cloudy deep amber, kind of pale brown in low light, with three fingers of soft fine foam like meringue. Yellowish amber when held to light. Foam lingers like mad and sticks firmly to the side of the glass.  Big fruit salad nose. Apricot. Tropical fruits: pineapple, among others. A little bit of banana phenol as it starts to warm. A good dose of funk, with slight leather notes and that musty thing. Candied orange and lemon with some spice. Quite tangy overall. Faint hint of medicinal phenol, perhaps eucalyptus. A definite dash of pepper. Kind of like a saison, but different.  Flavor is not at all what I expected. It's exceptionally dry and subdued--actually hard to pick out what the predominant flavor is before the swallow, because it seemed like not much was happening. Quite bitter though. This is one of the hoppiest Belgians I've ever had, especially considering it's over a year old--there is a firmly bracing bitterness in the aftertaste. This lingers with a kind of horehound, old-fashioned candy flavor, just without any sugar. Perhaps this is a touch of something roasted. It's just so dry I can't place the flavors. My accompanying pretzels leave a sweeter taste in the mouth than this. Still, this isn't tart at all... just not sweet at all. This is just underwhelming me--it doesn't have the funky excitement of the Jolly Pumpkin La Roja that I had last night, nor the richness of a Belgian Pale, nor the zest of a saison. I guess it has some funk going on, but it seems to happen over a lackluster backdrop that would be much better with some tang to it. There is some orange citrus to the flavor as it warms. The bitterness seems to override some of the other things going on, in my opinion, and whatever is going on needs to be more going on.  Mouthfeel: a bit of tingling and astringency on the tongue. Overall, light, fluffy and soft feeling texture, though perhaps a bit harsher at first with the strong carbonation.  Overall impression: the nose is quite an artistic achievement, the appearance is fine, the lacing is beautiful, the mouthfeel is delightful, but the flavor is quite lackluster. Rarely have I enjoyed my pretzels more than my beer. Not worth seeking again, though it would be nice to compare a fresh bottle. $6 is so much better spent on some other beer. Disappointing.  I'd give this a B or B- overall.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

A strong and full coffee cream caramel colored head.  Smells fruity and malty roasts with deep spices that remind me of Christmas dinners.  Taste is so smooth and enjoyable. Differing slightly than the smell, it is a bit more mellow yet still bursting with flavors. As it gets warmer the other tastes come out of hiding.  Feels on the lighter side of medium.

37,129,BamaBeerBuff,3.43,"Bottled on April 22, 2009. This is a relatively young bottle of Orval.  A: Pours a cloudy orange-amber with a massive off-white head that rockets towards the top of the glass. Thick sheets of lace remain on the sides of the glass and a heavy disc of foam remains atop throughout.  S: There's some noticeable apple and pear fruitiness, a floral component, a hint of peppery alcohol, and a faint musty horse-blanket like aroma. I'd say the predominant component is the fruitiness, but overall the aroma isn't too intense.  T&M: First bottle I had of Orval I really disliked. This bottle I disliked initially, but now about 1/2 way into it, it's growing on me a bit. Pale malt, a dry fruitiness, some leather/horse blanket/funk flavor are all upfront. A metallic and aggressive bitterness comes in late--this is rather hoppy for a Belgian! I'm thinking that some age would settle down those hops (this bottle is quite young) and hopefully reveal some additional complexity on the finish. Body is light to medium with an aggressive carbonation that works well with the bitterness.

Oh, best before Dec. 27, 2012 -- ought to be interesting.  BA calls this a Belgian Pale Ale, but the ABV is a bit high according the BJCP guides.  A -- Hazy, bright amber color with a very thick, light tan head.  S -- Fruit esters (peach and pear) with mild malt back -- some alcohol pepperiness peeking through.  T -- Hmm, quite interesting and more Biere de Garde in character to my palate; astringency in first taste, followed very quickly by a Brett funkiness, finishes dryly bitter. There's a mild caramel sweetness back, but no bready or nutty character to the flavor. If this truly is supposed to be a Belgian Pale, it's off. If it's a Biere de Garde, it's not terribly bad.  M -- Light medium body with a slick to crisp mouthfeel.

A sour funk with sweet dark fruits seems to be a decent description.  T- A prevalent sourness hits initially developing into a mellow citrus flavor. Some definite sweet malty bread flavors in the finish. Kind of has a sour apple flavor in the aftertaste. Loads of phenols and tartness. Not tasting much in the hops department, but this could be due to the age.  M- Medium bodied. A bit of funk and tannin like dryness throughout.  D- A very interesting brew.

37,129,MeisterBurger,4.29,"This thing has a whopping great head, loads of carbonation and a thick, wonderful lingering head. Which normally I like. But in this instance makes it all but impossible to take a sip without getting a face full of foam. Once it settles down it starts to lace beautifully.  Would you smell that? This is one of the best smelling beers on the planet, like candied fruit and sweet flowers or green Jolly Ranchers, but there's also a funky horsey smell in there too.  I should have taken the time to bring it up to temperature because, when cold, the taste is almost medicinal with a spiciness that stings the tip of the tongue and a bit of sourness. As the beer settles and warms a complex array of toasted, nutty, biscuity malt comes to the fore. The bitterness level is spot on. The 6.9% alcohol is present but it plays nicely with the other flavors. It gets a bit tart and soapy towards the end, and no bad thing.

37,129,Andrewtherooster,4.47,"Wow, I can't say I've ever had a beer that tasted like this. Smells a bit lactic, slightly of shoe-polish (and enjoyably so), buttery and a hint of something sweet I can't quite pin-point. Up-front I get a bit of cheddar flavor, a hint of grapefruit-sweetness, finishing with a nice toasty malt. I suspect some Brett used in this beer, as it has some of that wild/sour characteristic comes through. But where most wild ales would turn tart, Orval turns bready in the finish. It reminds a bit of a quality grilled cheese. In fact, I'm sure this beer would go great with a grilled cheese.  As for mouthfeel, I found the beer to be a bit over-carbonated when I first poured it into my snifter, but with some swishing around, it got much better. A little on the thin side, and a bit dry.

Head slowly recedes leaving behinds delicate strands of lacing. Nose is mild - some light fruity esters (maybe some pear and green apple) with a suggestion of funk that is masked considerably in the nose. Taste is consistent with nose; however, roles reverse in the flavor profile. Fruity flavors are concealed by a bit of funky/skunky tartness. Mouthfeel is light and lively and finishes somewhat dry with a bit of acidity/astringency that lingers lightly. A really nice Trappist ale.

Extaordinary taste! It's like the taste changes with every sip. It keeps surprising you. I like the bitterness and the sourness(that sourness reminds me perhaps of a sour ale). An exceptional brew.

Taste hits right off with strong notes of citrus, mostly lemon with a little bit of orange. A floral burst of hop flavor lies underneath with a lot of spice present.

37,129,weazal,4.23,"2nd Experience:  S: Solid, balanced aroma. Decent part funky/sour cherries (in a good way), but also seems close to tripel style spices. Similar to fresh, crisp fruit - like ripe nectarine, lemon but retains a pear mellowness.  T: Sharp carbonation, tart sourness, clean but lengthy finish, bit of a lingering pineapple-y bitterness from the hops. Flavors all flow together while still standing on their own in true Belgium balanced expertise. Good contrast with sharp carbonation, thick body, and finishing dryness. ___  1st Experience:  S: Rich and pungent dried lemon and spices. Some balanced yeast but overwhelmingly spicy.  T: Rush of carbonation up front that frankly overwhelms, hard to pickup on a lot of flavors with 1st sip. Mellow. Not as the aroma would lead you think. Interesting contrast between sharp carbonation and notably dry feel. The subtle flavors that 1st eek out are some sweet, gentle citrus, pear, and bitter yeast that continues into a briefly metallic finish and lingering, light hoppy bitterness.  Interesting for sure...but underwhelming.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Evil_Pidde,4.95,"This is a very nice trappistbeer.  A: When you pour this one it's all head at first, thick white creamy head. After a while the head sets and a pale orange beer appears. Since the beer is bottle-conditioned there is a murky tone to it.  S: The complexity is enormous. You can sence yeast (I'm geussing brettanomyces), fruit (citurs), a bit malt and a slight tone of hops.  T: At first it tastes a little funky, but then you get both floral- and bitterhops and fruit (citrus). This is a very complex-tasting beer that even holds a mix of dry and sweet. The aftertaste is long with some hops and also some dryness.  M: Powerful, like a punch in the mouth, creamy and a thickeling sencation - almost like a gueuze.  D: Buy this one and enjoy!!! This is a fantastic beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,TheNapkin,4.2,"What a beautiful beer. Sour, malty, and dry. A truly world-class Belgian. Great carbonation (meaning it's balanced with the flavor, not excessive and not underwhelmed), highly drinkable, great tartness and just enough thinness in the body to go down easy. Pleasant in so many ways.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,azorie,5,"Ok this is a new review after I deleted my old ones. The wife bought me a Orval glass, so I had to pour it into that. On my list of my top 5 this is a number 2.  A: Orange amber and cloudy in color with a insane 4"" white head cloudy white lace, leaving rings, even after 5 minutes there still there.  S: Citrus, juniper, herbs and hop flowers.  T: a first its very dry lemon and orange, with a bit of hops and juniper. Smooth and crisp. its just a top notch, old fashioned beer than American brewers wish they could make. The sweet candy sugar is there but its just barely, its so well balanced with Brett yeast its heaven in glass. the hops are sharp but well in balance.  M: Dry and medium body, great after taste.  D: geez this is the great beer to drink straight up or with food and/or cheese its just out of this world. I can never drink just one and even at 7 bucks a pop I always buy 6. This is the one beer worth it, well as most of the Trappists are. going to buy 7 this year.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,scottyshades,3.9,"Very interesting brew here. Served in an 11.2oz odd-shaped bottle. The label notes that it was bottled on 9/7/2008.  A: Pours a nice cloudy, amber color that produces a massive billowy head. The head itself if about 4 inches thick and bone white. Slight lacing is present, and the carbonation shows itself in the head.  S: Yeasty (brettanomyces), bready, sweet candy, sugar cane, spices (clove, coriander, and a few other subtle ones), citrus (lemon zest)...nice nose, the yeast smells similar to that of a lambic, along with the tart notes. Very nice and unique. Also, behind all that tartness lies the dry hops! A little subtle, but they are there...Styrian Goldings if I'm not mistaken  T: Very tart right off the bat. I personally am not a huge fan of tart brews, but this one is a little more balanced. The yeast notes are present, as well as a bready note. Earthier than the nose predicts, and less spicy. I do think one of the faults with this one is the carbonation, which is waaay overdone in my book. It takes away from the other flavors that try to make this brew more enjoyable. Just realized (Drinking as I'm reviewing this one), but there is a lingering metallic note that is very up-front and present.  MF/D: Very very dry the whole way through, over-carbonated, light bodied, finishes tart.  This is one unique brew, if you spot one, try it",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,LestatSabastian,2.42,This beer was weird tasting to me. light color with bubbles around it looked like a soda. head from hell on one poor next poor hardly any. when I said it looked like a soda. Well it tasted like a bottle of sparkling water with a hint of beer. mouthfeel of water and baking soda. this beer is not strong but not very good tasting. I did not like it. Beau of Bama,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Grunewald,4.28,"A - poured from a 0.33L bottle into a weizen glass. The color looks like a Hefeweizen (amber and cloudy). There was a metric ton of head, thick and foamy.  S - grass, hay, and a hint of sweet licorice  T - a bitter grainy taste, with a light sherry like flavor  M - delightful carbonation that fizzles on the tongue then finishes quite dry  D - a complex beer that would go well paired with finger food",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,DanielClouser,4.57,"11 point... I dunno--2? (less than 12, anyway)--oz bottle into Chimay goblet.  A--Nice amber color. Nothing special, but the head does start out huge. I didn't find that it stuck around for too long, on this bottle.  S--I tend to not get a lot of smell from buggy beers. A nice subtle fruitiness, though.  T--Excellent! Only my second bottle of Orval, and this one is very different from the first, with a lot more Brett. I appreciate Brett but do not love it, but it works so well in this beer. A perfect dry bitterness that does not overwhelm the palate melds seemlessly with the Brett. Really, the perfect integration of flavors is what really makes this beer.  M--Dry, dry, dry, and oh, so great! Usually, mouthfeel is something I struggle to review, but Orval makes it easy. I love this beer.  D--For me, Brett will hurt the drinkability of any beer ever so slightly. But there is just no perceptible residual sugar here to turn me (that's what gets me with the Brett--the way the funk interacts w/ residual sugar). I could drink these until I got kicked out of the bar.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,brokensail,4.05,"A: Amber orange in color with 2+ fingers of foam (that lasts forever).  S: The nose is yeasty and a little funky with some tart apple notes.  T: I pick up an ever so slight tartness, along with yeast and that subtle barnyard/wet hay funk. This is not necessarily bitter or sweet/malty in any way that I can tell.  M: The body is on the lighter side, with a high level of carbonation and a dry finish..  D: One of the more ""interesting"" Trappist beers",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,alabamagolf,3.35,"A: Cloudy blonde color. Large fluffy head - which lasts a really long time and leaves a thick film of lacing. Reminded me of a Hefeweizen, just with a lot more head and carbonation.  S: Mild Belgian yeast aroma.  T: Well-balanced ale. Alcohol is very hard to detect. The finish is tart and slightly bitter. Medium body.  M: Nicely carbonated.  D: Easy ale to drink.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Orangevango,4.02,"Honey-colored and cloudy, Orval produces a healthy off-white creamy head that sticks around. It is a sight for sore after a day out in the sun; it looks thirst quenching (if something can). I swirl the glass to take the first wiff and am presented with a delicate malt aroma accented very nicely by strong and earthy Brett. The lacing after my swirl is impressive. The hop aroma is earthy as well, and it mingles with the Brett so nicely that it is difficult to say where one stops and the other begins. The flavor is odd. My first thought was tart, but upon a second sip, it was no longer tart, thats when the DMS hit me, not overbearing but certainly present. Bitterness is far more assertive than the hops were in the nose. This beer is quite refreshing. The hop flavor is spicy, and the bitterness lingers. Add a little bit of funk from the brett and you've got Orval. The flavor is pleasent, but nothing to write home about, and certainly no peer of the aroma. The carbonation is quite high and the body quite light.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,jammalamma,4.05,"It took a minute just to get to the brew, the head is explosive! great lacing and head retention. Dark golden brown-amber color.  Hints of funk, lite apple/ grape-pear nose, complex. Smooth, very well balanced (no one flavor as wild as head); slightly bitter.  Over all-very good. This bottle is 1yr old, like to try 3-4yr bottle.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,berley31,4.73,"Pours with a nice, creamy, off-white head that is absolutely huge - and continues to rise after sitting. Body is amber-orange and hazy. Excellent lacing...this is a perfect-looking beer! Great aroma as well; quite yeasty, with citrus tones. The first sip is excellent - lightly sweet and acidic, with a medium, creamy body. Fizzy carbonation. At 6.9%, you can taste the alcohol but it's hardly overwhelming... perfectly balanced. The head is fully lasting throughout drinking, and the finish is long as well. Excellent beer - one of my new favorites - and great that you can actually find in many places outside of Belgium.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,jwheeler85,3.62,"I tried to be as objective as possible for this one since I wasn't personally a big fan of it. Higher scores are more based on uniqueness rather than like/dislike.  A- Poured a deep amber with some head retention  S- Slightly grassy and herbal. Also had a slight fruity note with a background smell sort of like musty leather. (very unique, but not personally a fan of this combo)  T- More astringent and bitter than it is sweet. I'm also getting a little bit of orange peel and coriander type flavors. Finishing with that odd sort of leathery note.  M- Medium carbonation, and medium mouthfeel.  D- For me, this had low drinkability... it was one of those beers that I can feel expand like crazy in my gut... makes me feel really bloated.  Overall, I would recommend that everybody try this one at least once... just due to the fact that it is so unique in it's flavor profile. I've never had anything else quite like it. Again, I didn't particularly like it, but it's uniqueness is something to be admired.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,jpaltan,4.15,"Bottled on 10/14/2006. Big head that refuses to go away. Lacing all over the sides. Golden amber colored. Smell is slightly tart and sour, but mostly has smells of light fruits like pears and apples. Smell is tart up front then a bitter finish mixed with spiciness and the tartness. Very peppery in the end. Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated for sitting almost three years in the bottle. Beer is rather dry in the end.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Cylinsier,4.62,"Poured from a bottle.  This beer comes out a hazy amber that glows orange against the light. The head is thick and massive, and it simply refuses to go away. The bubbles are extremely fine.  Smells malty and tart, like citrus. The aroma is also a bit floral, like honey.  Taste is extravagant. Its delicately sour and sweet. The tartness is almost wine like but the understated sweetness is like sugary malts. This one has a resemblance to some of the taste features of the Flanders red ale style, but more subdued than the ones of that style I've had before.  The mouthfeel is fluffy and carbonated. Just as you could see the head as being very fine, you can feel the carbonation is very fine.  A really fantastic and mesmerizing beer. I could probably drink a case of these in a day and not realize I was doing it.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,PsychoJedi,3.82,"It pours what would be a nice shade of golden, but filmy. The head is enormous! One of the biggest (but not the biggest) head I have ever poured. It goes down slow with a thickness in the head. The smell is good. I bit fruity, but not to excess with what might be a malty background covering up some of the fruit smell. Taste is alright. Not fruity and not malty, but not much too it than I expected from a Belgium beer. Rather uneventful to some part, but the taste is there. No after taste. Goes down rather smooth. Verdict: try it and judge for yourself.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,johntangus,4.22,"Beautiful beer produced magnificent head and lacing. A light amber/copper color.  First taste came to mind: bubblegum. Then the complexities came forth - bananas, hops, honey, wheat.  Smelled like Juicyfruit.  Dry but not overpowering so.  A wonderful beer. Would drink several in one sitting if given the chance.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,grayburn,4.53,"This is a love or hate beer, I compare it best to the Dallas Cowboys. The only difference, I love this beer.  The pour is this massively alive frothy cauldron explosion. Not explosion to the point of losing ambrosia, just some heady bubbles. Amazing retention and lacing.  The smell and taste are both amazingly complex. I could write different details about every singly sip, but let me say that some light pepper-citrus notes blend with some citrus-funk to amaze the senses. Changes all the time, sour to sweet to hoppy to malty to wtf...stop changing you crazy beast....  The mouthfeel is incredibly dry without being even slightly offensive, nice..very nice.  I could drink a few of these, great beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Voonder,4.18,"Thank to bobsy for this! Pours cloudy light copper color with huge off-white head. Very good retention. Smell - somewhat sweet, raisiny, slight hoppiness coming throgh, some grassy aromas, some malts. Pretty complex aroma, very interesting. Taste is hoppier than smell, some citrusy notes appear, maltiness is all the way through, bitter finish. Very nice balanced brew, very smooth, alcohol is not noticeable. Very drinkable.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,dgilks,4.24,"A - Pours a hazy orange colour. White head with large bubbles dissapates quickly to a small island of head. Decent lacing.  S - Brett funk is very evident with a nice underlying fruit note. Possibly cherries and peaches. Very nice.  T - More bitter than most Trappist ales I've had with a subtle hoppiness. Plenty of Brett funk is evident and the peaches and cherries from the nose are evident. It is nice but could be a bit punchier.  M - Rich, slightly more than medium body. Below average carbonation. This is very nice and silky.  D - Very drinkable.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,SleepyMonk,4.13,"Chilled brown bottle poured into chalice glass.  Immediately generates a surging dense head that measures in around 3 fingers. The body of the beer is very much inviting. A rich and glowing amber color moving towards the darker edge of the color scale. The session is marked by sticky lacing through out.  The aroma is well defined with a beautiful and rich saturated pine scent. Cut grass and spring time themes run strong as to does yeast and a certain amount of citrus.  The taste is also focused on pine via an energetic mix with citrus like orange, mild peppers, yeast and a very subdued malt.  In the mouth this is creamy with a sustained taste delivery and a long dry sticky finish.  One can find the Orval experience a little unusual when first encountered perhaps due to the complexity and hefty pine theme, however you will be rewarded if you give it some time.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,rapidsequence,3.86,"Poured from a twelve oz bottle (maybe 11.2-- its all the way in the kitchen)  Appearance: Hazy orange. Head is ridiculously good-- like a scoop of ice cream on my beer. Leaves beautiful lacing that will probably have to be scrubbed out of the glass.  Smell: Brett! It overpowers everything for me. I happen to like the smell though. I describe it as hay from a horse stable, but an even better description is the smell of dogwood flowers as they start to rot-- these sound gross, but they're actually nice smells for me very organic.  Taste: Its crisp, thirst quenching, a little citrusy, and dry, dry, dry. Hope you like a little funk. Yum.  Mouthfeel: Tingly, dry, lots of carbonation. I can't stop rolling it around in my mouth.  Drinkablility: Certainly easy to drink. Truthfully, I like smelling it as much as drinking it. As fun and interesting as it is, I don't want another right now. Tomorrow, yes.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,bhalter8,4.13,"Have been looking forward to sitting down and sipping this bottle, even ended up with a free Orval goblet to pour in. How authentically Belgian of me. Pours a hazy amber to orange color with beautiful dense white head. Following a few sips, I am extremely impressed by the lacing left around the glass. I am not a complete appreciator of the wild funk, but this definitely has it. The brett is there, as is some citrus hints. There is definitely a lot going on in the nose, and I guess I need to continue to explore these styles to fully appreciate it. There is a nice bitter and citrus balance in the taste, nothing too offensive. I have had some that are all sour, but in this case there is enough other flavors to balance it out. The funk (some call it barn) smell is there in the flavor, but is not too powerful. A very crisp and tart ale, with a fair amount of carbonization. In the end, I am enjoying each taste of this sipper, trying to pick up everything, but it is certainly a new realm for me. I do believe I'd like to pair this with some food in the future, alone you are left to ponder this beer too much, and I bet it is nice with some cheese and bread.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Mistofminn,4.05,"Pours much darker than a typical Belgian Pale Ale. Hazy orange with a light carbonation. The head on this one is something else. Off white and absolutely pluming. It's almost too much. Retention is amazing, lacing is great. The head is chunky and sticky, just like a rootbeer float.  Wow. So there is the horse blanket. They sure don't sugar coat it. Definitely some barn smell here. I'm new to the whole brett thing, but if this isn't brett, I don't know what is. Funky and funky. Thats really the only way to describe it, funky. It's not bad, it's just....different.  The taste starts off tart and sour, but mellows out in the aftertaste. That is where the funk shows up. This is truly something else. Definitely an acquired taste. If I was served this last year at this time, I most likely would have sent it back saying it was awful. But at this point in my beer journey, it's interesting. It's not good, and it's definitely not bad, it's just interesting. The taste keeps you coming back for more as you try to figure it out.  Mouthfeel is much like other brews. Light in body and light in carbonation. Drinkability is a little lower than I would usually give a brew, but only because of the strange taste. This is really something else.  I knew going into this that it would be different. I was kind of worried to be honest. I'm pleased that I at least could appreciate the product, and this intriguing brew will be in my fridge again in the future.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,51mmz0rz,4.47,"Bottle marked 03.08.2004 / 03.08.2009, so a bit past the recommended date. Poured into a Chimay chalice.  A: Vigorously carbonated opaque orange body. Head has decent retention as the bubbles fly off the carving on the bottom of the glass.  S: Brett tang is the most dominant aroma. A pretty intense fruitiness, and some mild complex 'farmy' smells. Nothing off putting.  T: Light fruit up front, mild tang is enjoyable and interesting. A bit a hop flavor in the middle, nothing crazy of course. A medium bitterness follows. On the finish I think I taste the regular Belgian yeast character, if only slighty.  M: Highly carbonated and refreshing.  D: The acidity along with no really crazy flavors keep it Highly drinkable and actually really refreshing.  UPDATE: Had a fresher bottle (01/06/10) tasted on 9/2011, the hop presence is much more prevalent.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,climax,4.42,"Bottled in December of 2007, sampled May 2009. Bottle erupted when I popped the top. Needless to say, it was eager to give some wicked head, one which never really faded. Color was an entirely cloudy burnt orange.  Excellent nose, very invigorating and complex. Great balance of sweet, sour, and bitter. Flavors include, but not entirely entail; green apple, sour grapes, hay, spice and grassy hops.  Flavor was equally as enjoyable. The malt seemed to shine through a bit more in taste as opposed to nose. The malt and hops were in perfect harmony. Dark sugars, spice, cranberry, apple, wood, and maybe licorice are some discernible flavors among several others of which I cannot put my finger on.  The body was very light-hearted given the flavor explosion. However, it was never watery and the ample carbonation left a nice sharpness on the tongue through a somewhat dry long finish.  This one went down quite smooth and was really a joy to break down and review... as well as drink. Really my first honest example of this style (other than perhaps Leffe and some others that I didn't think were anything to write home about), it turned me on and hopefully more are in my (immediate) future.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Bitterbill,5,"Bought locally for $3.50.  It pours a cloudy orange gold with a 3 finger head of foam(served cold) with lots of lacing.  The smell is yeasty and bready with some good notes of funk.  The taste has the Brett and yeast at the forefront followed closely by some pepper, light clove, and some hop bitterness which shares finishing duty with some funk. D-licious. Oh, I've had this many times before as I picked em up from CO before but I'm somewhat aghast that I haven't reviewed it before.  Medium bodied with a rather high level of carbonation, I'm having a hard time not raising the glass to my mouth which leads to....  Drinkability. This is one of my favourites so it's damn drinkable for me and the goodness of the Brett is one big factor steering me that way. A world class brew!

I poured Orval into my Chimay chalice, and it is a beautiful looking brew. There are mounds of off white head, with an orangish/copper and murky body.  The aroma is very fruity and faint. It is somewhat pear like.  The taste is a bit on the sour side, and finishes bitter like slight grapefruit. As it warms up, the hops start to shine through the yeasty characteristics a bit more.

Orange citrus, nectar-sweet smell, with some florals and spice.  Good hop bitterness caught me off guard, with flowery and grassy 'sweetness' that kept the flavor tight.  Plenty of carbonation (maybe too much) matched the hop profile to give this a crisp, dry mouthfeel.

Aroma's are prominent with some citrus lemon, and hops are every present throughout with good doses of spices that sting the nostrils.  Taste was a blast of carbonated goodness with lemon zest, phenols, spices and a very nice hop presence in each and every sip. The complexity of this beer is mind boggling. I loved how each sip presented each flavor a little different from the last.  Big mouthfeel. Lots of carbonation on the tongue. Fantastic  This to me is the epitome of drinkability.

Pours a light, cloudy amber color with a thick rocky head that climbs the glass.  The aroma is very interesting, fresh, bright, and fruity and sweet. There's a strange quality to it that must be the brett. The taste is more of the same, a bit of a sour tartness to it, some grass flavors and some citrus.

37,129,alcstradamus,4.26,"A--Pours a beautiful amber/copper color with a huge 4 finger head in my Dogfish Head signature glass. There are etchings in the bottom of the glass to release the carbonation so this head is not going anywhere. I don't know how I'm going to actually drink this beer, it is just sitting there with 4 fingers of head and seems to keep growing...ok, after a few minutes it is finally dropping. It has settled down to a fluffy marshmallow topping and left THICK lacing down the glass. I know the glass contributed to the appearance here, but this is one of the best looking beers I have poured.  S--Esters, green grapes, caramel, spices. Very pleasant but not huge nose.  T--Light spices, caramel, a bit of a band-aid funkiness. Very malty and easy to drink, no single flavor overpowers. Notes of leather, orange peel, and lemon deep in the background.

I appreciate that and it helps with the drinkability  D--Very fine brew here, nearly flawless for the style.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,JoEBoBpr,4.35,Poured into a Snifter.  A - Pale orange color when poured that looks like a light amber in the glass with a thick white head that retains for a long time with medium sized bubbles. Hazy.  S - Smells of coriander and cloves and spice with some slight peach as well. Very malty almost no hops character. Some mild nut hints as well like almonds. There is great funk to this beer very delicious aroma. Nice farmhouse hints. Phenolic hints.  T - Very malty at the beginning with extreme hints of nuts and some slight hints of banana as it goes down as well. Spices a plenty with some nice coriander and some great surprising funk from a Belgian PA. Nice tartness is present as well. Very complex with different flavors swirling about. Very good tasting beer. A bit of hops at the end but only noticeable really as it finishes. Some phenolic tastes as well.  M - Very attractive. Carbonation is on the high side but its not crazy. Light to medium bodied.  D - Refreshing and complex at the same time.,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,jeremy13586,4.71,"After getting an Orval glass from my girlfriend as a birthday gift, I felt that it was fitting that I review the beer as well.  The appearance is amazing. A translucent light-brown/dark-orange fills the glass. The head left in the goblet is nothing short of inviting. A lovely off-white foam towered above the rim without spilling over, creating an almost cavernous formation. A sweet, yet, citrusy and floral aroma is in the nose. A nice spicy, almost nutmeg, note is in there as well. The taste is appley and fresh. There is no other way to describe it.  I am now half way through the beer and trying to warm it with my hands, hoping to reveal something more in the amazing taste and aroma. A fine layer of bubbles lies atop of the brew, with the last two mountains of foam shrinking in to oblivion. With each sip, one takes in a more spicy and flavorful taste than the last. Each swallow finishes crisp and clean, as if you were biting in to a Granny Smith apple.  This beer is not only a beer, but an experience.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,ToasterChef,4.55,"Poured from a bottle. Split between two 8 oz glasses. There is a significant amount of head with this beer, full of tiny bubbles. The head is reducing over time. You can see the bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass, much more so than other beers. There is a floral, yeasty smell to this beer. There is noticeable carbonation to the mouthfeel, This doesn't seem as light as I remember the other Trappist beers being, but it is exceptionally drinkable. The taste is slightly alcohol with overtones of grass. Because it is a Trappist beer, you know it will be good. I recommend Orval to any beer drinker.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Stavage,4.4,"Poured into the correct Orval glassware, a nice slightly hazed orange amber colour with a big rocky frothy white head. Nice and thick, lasted long and left a decent lacing.  Smell was refreshing, you can tell you're in for a dry beer. Grassy, citrus, and a kind of sharp herbal scent.  Taste was very crisp, very dry, very refreshing yet complex. This is my first Belgian pale but I've had many an English and American Pale ale and I've never had one that manages to be this full of flavour AND have complexity AND be highly refreshing. Had a citric malt bite which eases into that refreshing grassiness whilst maintaining its sourness. Sour like sourdough tartness not like lemons. Just a good mix of very subtle citric fruitiness with grassy malty goodness. Ends in a sharp bitter hops high note which lingers leaving a nice dryness.  Mouthfeel is light, well carbonated, crisp and dry. And it may be too drinkable for it's own good. In a barbaric moment I could see myself slamming this down to quench a ferocious thirst. Which would be horrible considering the complexities in this brew. I really did have to hold myself back from drinking this too fast though.  Damn...this is hard to find here and expensive when I do see it...generally I prefer forking out for the darks and dubbels and tripels and quads. I'm content with Australian pale ales. But damn this was really really nice. Just wish it was more common and affordable.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,nighthawk,4.56,"330mL bottle with bottled-on and best-before dates on label. Poured into chalice.  Huge rush of carbonation and head production as I pour. When the head has settled a little I see a cloudy orange body, with plenty of carbonation visible. I suspect it will retain until the end, and it does.  Aromas of peaches, apple, banana and some spices (pepper, coriander maybe, clove) and a bit of sugary bubblegum. With the surging carbonation of the pour it's readily apparent, but is more muted once the beer has settled down.  Taste is hugely complex. I doubt I've been able to tease them all out. Barn flavours, some grassiness, lemon tartness, some mildly citrus hops, mild peppery and cinnamon spice and a bit of yeast.  Mouthfeel is light, well-carbonated, and fairly dry. Crisp, but lingering finish.  Drinkability is high for its enticing complexity - I want more just to be able to soak in its complexities.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,KickInTheChalice,4.43,"Poured into a tulip.  Appearance: While pouring this, I moved from pouring slowly down the side to dropping the beer in the center, and the head simply exploded, Duvel style. The carbonation keeps replenishing while there is still beer in the glass as well. This is a nice dark orange and copper color, with a monster head that leaves all kinds of sticky lacing on the glass. Very nice.  Smell: A little bit light in the smell department. Some citrus and apple aromas, along with a variety of spices.  Taste: By far the best aspect of this beer. I get some strong tart flavor with the malt up front, mostly apple and maybe some grape. A nice blend of nutmeg and even a little cinnamon is present throughout the sip. The hops are fairly light and citrusy in nature, leaving me with more of a tart than a true bitter taste on my palate. Quite tasty and definitely unique.  Mouthfeel: Actually a little bit light, which I would not have expected from the darker color. A nuanced breadiness stays on my tongue, giving it a little bit of texture.  Drinkability: Very easy to drink. After what seemed like just a sip, I looked down and I was almost done with the glass. Very smooth, propped up by a nice level of carbonation and a crisp, balanced flavor.  After my first try, I think that I will have to sample a few more of these, in order to accustom myself to the different taste. I did not feel it was ""dirty"" or ""funky"" as a few other reviewers thought, but maybe I will get those senses next time I drink it.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Doomcifer,4.85,"Wow...I haven;t had one of the Bad Larry's in a while!  Bottled on 2/20/08 ; pretty old bottling but should still be great.  Pours a bright golden color with a fantastic rocky, frothy, sticky head that retains unbelievably well. Mass amounts of lacing sticks to the Chimay glass. Smells of brett funk, yeast, vinegar, leather...tons of things going on here. Tastes of tons of funk on the palate, tart cherries, with a huge backbone of IODINE. Reminds me of a spirit ie single malts in it's crazy complexity. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, lots of carbonation, prickly on the mouth, and dry finish. Drinkable on the fact that you can't put it down while you're trying to figure out everything that is going on inside this extraordinarily unique beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,mulder1010,4.85,"Solid, solid beer. Other reviews are spot on. If you are not into Belgian beers I suggest you try this beer first and it will change your mind. Lve the orange color and how the head retention stays through drinking. Mixed cherries with also a bit of straw (hey). Great pairing with seafood, like mussles!!! Only real negative is that it can be a bit pricy, very worthwhile to drink.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Parrotshake,4.63,"I try to have a few of these lying around at all times, because this is what beer is all about. At this point, the couple I had left over for the explicit purposes of blowing people-who-aren't-really-into-beer's minds are fair game, because I have to move in a few days and can always buy more, right?  If you've never had Orval, you have no idea what to expect. Last Christmas Eve a friend and I went to the Platform Bar here in Brisbane while waiting for his girlfriend to come pick us up for dinner. I'd first tried it a year or so before and disliked it (but was somewhat intrigued), but I thought it was time to give it another chance.  I bought 2 on my first round and seconds after his first sip, my friend turned to me and asked, and I quote: ""What's wrong with you, you weirdo?"". But at the end of the round, he got 2 more. And as his girlfriend got later and later, we became more and more enlightened (beacuse you can't get drunk off Trappist ales, anyway &gt;_&gt;).  If you've an open mind, this beer can make a convert of you. And your friends, and their friends.  Presentation-wise, the teardrop bottle is a timeless classic. But it looks good out of the bottle, too. Rich orange, massive unyielding off-white head, a little sediment. A picture in a glass.  Smell is the least appealing thing about this beer - if there is such a thing - only because it's not indicative of what's to come. Still respectable - big-time yeast, cut grass, citrus peel, sourdough bread, cold-sore cream (!), turned soil. Just a lot of stuff going on.  Tastes like your spice rack smells, along with champange, bubblegum, underripe red apples, (dried?) flowers, green wood and lemon pith, all under a blanket of medicine/iodine. There's a sweetness throughout, but it defers to everything else.  Quite carbonated, but no more than it needs to be. Like biting into a slightly chalky green apple - dryish.  This is a big leap from the kind of beer you can buy in a plastic cup at a football game, and I admit, I'd had a dozen of these before I could honestly say I unequivocally love it. But do persevere. God has a special place in his heart for the monks at Abbaye Orval. This is proof.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,ZorPrime,4.62,"Wow, this is an extraordinary beer.  Amber color with a fruity smell with some spices. Faint notes of banana too. The head is nice and doesn't disappear. The taste is complex... very hard for me to describe the taste. In the end, I do taste the hops. However, very hard to describe the spicyness... I would guess some cloves. Anyway, I love it... with more beer tasting, maybe I'll get more in the taste.  The mouthfeel is very good with a good amount of carbonation in the mouth. I could certainly drink more than one of this one.  This is definitely a good beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,callmescraps,3.95,"Good looking bottle that's for damn sure. Great cap too.  Appearance - A hazy apple cider color. Sort of gold orange with a massive rocky off-white head. Huge iceberg of a head. Great looking. Nice lacing.  Smell - Funky hay. Sweet cherries. A little medicinal spice. Tart apples. A little funky yeast and a hint of booze. Smells just awesome.  Taste - Sweet tart apples up front. Not quite as much spice as I might want. Honestly, kind of thin. It smells so nice but it just doesn't follow up on the potential. A little bread. A hint of the medicinal goodness that I love, but sort of fades away. It's sort of complex, but it just doesn't add up to quite enough.  Mouthfeel - Nice carbonation. Not too thick. Pretty smooth, but no tongue coating goodness.  Drinkability - Pretty solid. It's a nice beer, goes down easy.  This is a good beer, just not lighting my world on fire. I was so excited from the look and the smell, but then it just fell a little flat for me. A little oomph away from being fantastic.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,585,4.1,"Friday night's bottle; Orval.  Not the first time I've tasted this one, not by a long shot, but my first review here and a pretty good place to start.  Taken up from the cellar and given half an hour in the fridge to cool, then drunk from my standard pinot noir glass. Very young, brewed just a few months ago.  First impression is a fantastic rich colour, warm burnt orange verging on gold and a tight off-white head which persists. The appearance is very impressive; Orval looks just as it tastes, complex and challenging.  The aroma is powerful, as usual with this beer my first thought is of the heady yeast which envelopes a cinnamon undertone. Organic, aged notes are also in the background; an inviting experience, this is a drink that rewards the nose.  Time to taste; the nose gave away some of the story, light spiced and an ever so delicate medicinal feel. Incredibly complex, and incredibly dry. Not a hint of sweetness to be found, the strength is hidden and the feeling is decked in character.  Always a pleasure, a beer I come back to and look forward to, undeniably classy.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,berkey,4.67,"Bottled 02/02/2008. Curious to see how this compares to a much fresher bottle I had over the weekend.  Pours a bright but somewhat hazy orange amber color with a huge slightly off white head and just the right amount of carbonation. Head fades to a thin lingering crown and the carb slowly but very loudly subsides as the tiny bubbles created by bottle conditioning start popping off.  Aroma brings to mind fresh sourdough bread, dry brett, citrus peel, and wet grass, with some bitter hops in the background.  The famous brettanomyces yeast creates a remarkably dry flavor. More lemon and orange peel flavors here along with a strong underlying tartness. Hops have died a bit with age but the increased brett keeps it interesting. While the carb has died quite a bit from when first poured there's still enough left for a mouthfeel that teams up with the dry flavors for a very pleasant drinkable ale. Wish it came in six packs.  Overall a matchless brew. Happy to finally get around to reviewing one of my favorite ales. This one isn't for everyone I notice but definitely worth a taste. If you like the dry and mellow tart flavors as much as I do this could end up as one of your favorites.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,pwoods,4.15,"11.2oz. brown bottle, purchased at Hyde Park Wine and Spirits, poured into a chalice.  A: Pours a fire-y amber into my chalice, hazy, yeasty with an eruption of carbonation from the nucleation site. More than 2 fingers worth of very lightly tinted head forms, rocky toward the bottom and thick and creamy up top, and holds for quite a bit. Good lacing.  S: Nice aroma. Sweet and fruity, loads of yeasty esters. Great musty, earthy aroma with some lemon rind and a soft tartness. Light malts, a touch of sweetness.  T/M: Funky, tart, and sour up front... not big time, though... soft. More of the musty and earthy flavors with some tart lemon and green or white grape skin. Nicely balanced malts with a touch of sweetness and sustenance. Plenty of yeasty flavors with pepper coming out furthest. Body is medium with big carbonation that prickles the tongue. Medium dry and grows through the finish.  D: Pretty damn drinkable. Not too terribly priced either, if you find the right store.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,evantwomey,3.95,"Poured into a goblet. Big, foamy head which lingers for a while. Little lacing. Color is reddish-amber, good clarity. Aroma is fruity and funky. The brett comes through very nicely and really sets this beer apart from the other trappist ales. Taste is not quite as good as the aroma. Faint malt taste with a dry and surprisingly bitter finish. Very vinous. Mouthfeel is 'explosive' - when I swish it in my mouth, it instantly turns to foam. This stuff is seriously carbonated. I think the massive carbonation might mute some of the flavors.  Overall this is a fantastic beer and the weirdest of the trappist beers I've had so far. The brettanomyces sets it apart, and it is easily the best Belgian pale ale I've had.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,goatgoat,4.27,"Bottled on 9/23/08, Chimay glass.  Pours a huge mounding very light tan head. Even a very gentle pour fills more than half the goblet with head. As it falls, a very enticing lacework coats the glass. Color is a hazy orange. Aroma is very fruity and tart. Orchard fruits, banana, lemon, grass and hay. A faint flowery note? Flavor is pretty light... sweetness, tart, grainy/grassy. Finish is dry, lightly bitter, with a hint of barnyard. But it also has little astringency in the back of the throat that's a bit distracting. Very light, extremely dry feel. Lots of carbonation.  Before shelling out the cash for a Trappist (they are expensive little buggers) I did a little looking. I'm only on ""sports and weather"" terms with many Belgian styles, so I looked around. The reviews of Orval promised something different. Well, I'm pretty impressed. Tart, a little funk. This is a damn tasty brew. I'd like a little more funk, which I may get for an older bottle.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,RuudJH,4.7,"This is defenately the trappist that breathes cloisterlife the most. The experience of sniffing and sipping this ale is something Medieval. It reminds me of old churches and chapels in Europe I've visited.  (Meanwhile looking at the uniquely shaped bottle).  A: Great colour(between orange and brown), great head (beige, very thick and fluffy, and great lacing). Great to look at. S: Defenately very pleasant. Fruit (cherry, strawberry), entertaining hops, something hard to define (pepperminty), plust the yeast, that gives it great dimension.. T: This beer is very intruiging with the Brettanomyces, topclass malts, but also it's spicy with pepper, plus a taste of both fresh and dried fruits, bread and good hops. M: This drink is very dry, the taste stays in your mouth long. D: Allthough it's not too high on alcohol (between 6 and 7% abv on the label, it seems to vary), I think it's a beer for sipping. It also goes well with crackers 'n old hard cheese.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Kadonny,4.32,"Poured from a bottle (of course) into a tulip glass.  A: A dark golden orange color almost brownish. A huge billowy white fluffy head that leaves sticky glass lacing throughout the glass.  S: Fruits, with grape, citrus and a candy sweetness, spicy yeast also detected.  T: Yeasty with fruit flavors of concord grape, lemon, apple, pear, citrus and a floral hop flavor. A nice sweetness follows along like candied fruit or sugar, but not overly so like I expected. Very complex as it warms, the spicy yeasty characters come out more so. The floral hops stick through the finish. Very nice, I like this.  M: Sweet but dry. Finish is getting sweeter as it warms, no alcohol (or very little) is detected.  D: Fairly high, unexpectedly so. I heard a ton about this beer.  Overall I was more than impressed. I heard this is a love it or hate it beer because of the brett, I personally loved it. Very good, very complex, great belgian and another great trappist beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

A lot of the yeast character comes through as it warms up (which I let it do). It was very complex, with even hints of fruity tones. It went really well with the chocolate cake I was eating, which I wasn't sure it would. I love chocolate cake, and it put the chocolate cake to shame.  It was also really carbonated, which I expected and do enjoy, although it makes me drink it more slowly, which is ok with me.

37,129,beeristhefuture,4.33,"I was excited to try one of the more rarefied trappists, but was a bit confused by this one.  Appearance: A thick, burnt-golden color with a firm and very durable head that just did not quit. It definitely had the appearance of tradition, and that was very appealing.  Smell: Strangely, it did not have a very powerful aroma; champagne grape and grapefruit were the predominant fruit tones, with a faint lingering of pine.  Taste: This sense can't be discussed without including the mouthfeel. A huge amount of gas makes all of the flavors explode in the mouth, which definitely accented all of the sensations. Primarily champagne flavors resulting from a delicate balance of hops and pale malts made for a sweet, delicate experience.  Drinkability: With the higher weight it's a good thing this beer is so expensive. The large amount of gas made it very easy to drink, which could have bad results. Fortunately, it's got a built-in mechanism in being expensive, which prevents it from being drunk in excess.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

S: A lively hoppy and yeasty aroma, with some biscuit-type malts and lovely citrus notes.  T: A nice hoppy punch, followed into a robust grapefruit/lemon zest flavour that also has some subtle sweetness. The finish is moderately bitter and a bit salty.  M: Quite carbonated, but it doesn't set one off in the slightest. Medium-bodied and fairly smooth overall.  D: Not a session beer, but, acknowledging it is 6.9%, Orval is quite drinkable. It takes little effort to drink a bottle of it, keeping in mind it's the kind of beer you want to savour.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,MadTown1000,3.41,"Overall: It's always disappointing to try a beer you're supposed to like and have to give it a mediocre grade. It's clearly a serious beer, but I think you have to like pale ales in general to really appreciate it, and I don't.  Appearance: Dark, very cloudy straw color. Absolutely insane head of foam - I poured it into a pint glass, and got maybe an inch of beer into the glass before the rest of it was filled with incredibly long lasting foam. I let it settle for a couple of minutes and more than half the foam was still there. The stuff's like bubble bath - it sticks to the inside of the glass like glue. Points given for shock value if nothing else.  Smell - Strong sweet smell similar to what I've noticed in a lot of Belgian and Belgian-style beers. Almost overpoweringly sweet smell that actually doesn't quite match the taste - I'm docking some points for false advertising.  Taste: A very mild pale ale, with a little bit of the sweetness from the smell appearing in the aftertaste. An interesting combination, but it doesn't floor me. It's complex, but it loses the crispness you get with a lot of light colored beers without substituting in the really interesting flavors you get with a darker Belgian beer (like my favorite Gulden Draak). Sort of similar to Piraat, now that I think about it.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: That aftertaste is a negative here - it's a little bit cloying. Of course, this isn't a beer designed to be drank in quantity, so the fact that it would be tough to drink in quantity isn't a big downer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,HalfFull,3.79,"Poured from a bottle(best by Jan. 2014) into a large wine glass. Pours hazy and deep golden in color. A light two finger head sits atop the beer as a champagne like carbonation emanated from the bottom of the pour. Frothy lacing clung as the head settled.  Not a whole lot on the nose. Warms up to offer some light berries and just a hint of yeast intermingled with the malty effervescence.  Tastes is fruity and carries forward that champagne like carbonation from the pour. Actually reminds me of drinking some Moët & Chandon with a dash of Chambord in it. Otherwise a touch bittersweet on the finish. Pleasant malt backdrop.  Offers a decent feel with a lingering finish from the combination of fruit and carbonation. Drinkability is held in check by both the carbonation and the price. Glad I sampled this beer but will I do so again? I doubt it, though there are certainly friends I could recommend it to.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,dfitch81,4.6,"An extraordinary beer, this. Orval's excellence manifests in its intricate and subtle complexities. The exceptional artisanship that goes into crafting this masterpiece is unmistakeable.  Appearance: Before I even talk about the appearance of the beer I have to mention the bottle itself - a work of art in its own right. The neck flows seamlessly into the body, which then tapers gently to the narrower base. Simple, beautiful, elegant. Pouring the beer into my Orval chalice produced two fingers of rocky white head, which eventually settled into a silver-dollar sized patch in the center. The beer itself is a beautiful hazed-honey amber with numerous tidy bubbles scudding up the side.  Smell and Taste: Distinct to say the least, like no other beer I've ever tried. Some perfuminess and mustiness with hints of hay, tart fruit and roses in the nose; estery and phenolic notes are much in evidence. Taste mirrors and builds on the scent, with the estery, rosy flavor complemented by the subtle fruity tartness (reminiscent of litchis). Yeast flavor emerges towards end of the taste. Curious but wonderful dry finish invites another taste.  Drinkability: Highly drinkable with a wonderfully constructed body that allows you to appreciate the complexities inherent in the palate. Alcohol is difficult to notice, even though at 6.9% it is hardly lacking in that respect. This beer's complexity entices you to refill your glass again and again. The only problem is that unless you have lots of money, you'll never be able to fill your glass with Orval except on special occasions.  Overall a strange yet exquisite thing, to be savored slowly and delicately.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

It has a smooth mouthfeel that I would translate into being very digestible.  D: I would personally enjoy this beer if I could as part of a weekly rotation.

Phenols at first sip and later a distinct alcohol taste bordering on hot.  Distinct citrusy flavor towards grassy even at the threashold of cat's pee  Yeast spiciness, hop bitterness, no malt - that sums it up. I can imagine this as a nice pair with soft white cheese!  Carbonation packs a mean attitude; balanced and fresh. The hop aroma, especially the floral side is opening up as it warms up a bit.  A touch of bubble gum and a hint of berry are the most noticeable character that the yeast aroma offer and complemented with some spiciness in the taste.

Nose has a light, tart citrus quality, dry, with a light funky barnyard note underneath, and a bit of a floral note as well. Clean but complex.  Taste is quite complex - starts off with a crisp citrus tartness, quite funky around the edges with a dry barnyard character, then takes on a lemon meringue pie character around the middle of the tongue - clear lemon, some smooth vanilla sweetness. Gives way to a light, floral hop note on the finish, with a lingering, dry, earthy funk.  Mouthfeel is lively, a soft but active carbonation, with a creamy, fluffy character from the ever-present cap. Medium bodied.

It's a very interesting style, and one of the better ones. It took far too long to finally get around to it, but glad to have done so now... with the lower alcohol, it's inviting to have another.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,everetends,4.33,"A bottle I picked up from Green's in ATL. This was bottled on 9-07-08, not too bad. I was told to let it age, but I figure what the hell. Served up in a tulip.  A: Pours a really nice and mild orangish/brown color. Held to the light you get more of a lighter orange glow. The head is off white and a good three fingers. The head is seriously rocky and huge foam. The head has great retention thanks to the constant carbonation activity that is feeding the head and moving around in here. Lace is very soapy and sticky. Lots of rocky foam remains on the glass. This is a great looking brew for sure.  S: Smell is solid. Getting some nice Belgian yeasty quality. Nice bready malt character coming through here and it really works with the fruit goodness that lies within. Getting some really nice and crisp apple skin and some nice pear. There is a touch of banana in here which is a pleasant suprise. There is a little bit of dirty funk going on in here. Its very light but its just a nice earthy hay and dusty, wet wood.  T: Taste is very nice indeed. Yet again a really nice bready and crackery malt mixes wonderfully with the Belgian yeast coming out here. That fruit is very present. Lots of apple and ome sweet pear are on display in a big way. The banana is not as big time as I was hoping but a very nice addition to the flavors. Getting a little bit of lemon lime coming out that really reminds me of a light and sparkly lemon lime soda I used to have in europe. The hops are light and floral. All together, beautiful.  M: Light side of medium in body with a really huge and crisp carbonation presence that works oh so well here. This beer has a touch of a tart feel going on in here. This beer is slightly dry. ABV is no where to be found. Aftertaste is mostly some slightly tart apple and fruity goodness. This all works and very nice.  D: This beer is incredibly drinkable thanks to is light wieght and big time carbonation. Overall, this beer works on every level. The flavors are complex but still remain light and delicate. I think that is the best way to describe this beer. It has some much going on but it still remains delicate. Just a beautifully crafted brew. Glad I followed the advice of whoever it was who told me to get a bottle of this to give a go. Just great.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Brilliantly clear. The yeast must have settled out.  S-Hay and lemon rinds. Some Breadiness. Slightly metalic but pleasantly so. Yeasty. Very little hop aroma.  T- Still firmly bitter, even after 4 years. Dirty and biscuity.  M- Prickly carbonation keeps the palate ready for the next sip. Bone dry.

37,129,scootny,4.76,"This is a one of a kind brew. A firm, rocky and somewhat lively head sits atop a mostly clear copper fluid. A touch of chill haze. Subsequent pours add the yeast and the lovely roundness it brings to the glass. Retention is exemplary and a touch of carbonation activity in my glass. Lacing is generous and impressive.  Smell is unique. Cinnamon, orange, and lemon hit my nose first. A lovely sweet malt backbone and spicy notes as well. Belgian yeast esters and complex sugary compounds. A mix of apples, grapes, pears, and faint banana. Light hop florals. Wow. You spend a month on the nose alone.  Taste will take six months. Cinnamon and orange from the nose with a bigger lemon presence are bound to a sourdough like Belgian malt backbone. Just enough sweet breadiness to let you know you're drinking beer. A huge, dry but mild hop bittering follows that cleans your mouth out and allows you to savor the malt and yeasty breadiness of the brew as it lingers on your tongue and palate. Subtle fruits from the nose mix in and add depth and intrigue to this vixen in a bottle. Tartness from start to finish. Feel is super creamy and just on the heavy side of medium. A touch full as this is a very satisfying pale ale but still one you want to keep sipping at a good rate because the taste and feel are so inviting.  Drinkability is perfect as the fullness of the feel slows you down just enough to appreciate it while not getting in the way.  I finally get this beer. While anyone can enjoy it this is a beer that is very deep for newbies as the sophistication of it's construction requires an educated palate. While I have always enjoyed Orval for years, understanding it's difference and special place in the beer world requires patience and perspective.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,apowar,4.13,"Poured from 11.2 oz bottle into an unfortunate pint glass.  Pours a beautiful rusty orange color that reminds me of my mom's sun tea. Slightly hazy. Very large, persistent, stiff and foamy pale yellow head.  The aroma strikes me as bubble gum, ripe banana, and tart apple.  Flavor is slightly toasty up front and becomes a bit tangy including typical hop flavors such as candied lemon peel. Finishes with slight hop bitterness, belgian brewers yeast, and some very nice banana and candied citrus flavors.  Mouthfeel is very interesting. Clearly present carbonation that completely fills the mouth. It's assertive but not too prickly or strong, but actually rather soft. Overall, very drinkable, refreshing brew with enthralling complexity and richness or flavor. I can definitely see why this is considered the quintessential belgian pale ale.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Taste:this particular farm is growing mild spices and grains that need an acquired taste to truly appreciate this brew the malt and dry hops are unique and pleasent .

I could barely get half the bottle in the glass on the first pour.  S: Tartness with a hint of brett funkiness.  T: Dry, tart, and bitter. Bready aftertaste with just enough brett to add character.  M: Light and carbonated, almost ephemeral.  D: This is definitely a unique brew that is completely unlike any other Trappist beer.

Pours a golden amber color with bubbles rising to replenish the head the entire time. S= Pungent funk coming from it. Yeasty and spicy are the only things that come to mind. T= Funkiness and smooth belgian yeast taste. Spicy but not overly complex. Apples come through for sure. Very funky on the later sips as it warms. The alcohol is very very very well hidden. M= High carbonation. Fluffy and light. Dry finish on the tip of my tongue D= Pretty good. Not a bad beer at all. I was expecting a lot more just from what I've heard about it.

Very cool color.  Smelled very citric with a nice biscuity undertone. Bits of flowers in there also. Slight leather and tobacco scents.  Very nice taste here, heavier hop profile than most other trappists that I've had. Nice sweetness providing some lovely fruit flavors and butterscotch/caramel sweetness. Excellent depth here. Leaves the mouth quite dry, but still satisfied. Has a very creamy body to it/ definitely medium to full bodied beer here.

T = Some nice sweet malt up front quickly giving way to a surprising bitterness. Maybe a bit of a hop character.  M = Light and crisp. A bit prickly on the tongue. Finishes dry. Not bad.

Funky yeast notes and a slight bit of hoppy notes coming through there.  Wow, thats a dry beer. Definately a sipper despite the low (for a Belgian) ABV. More hoppy than most Belgians but not what I'd call a ""hoppy"" beer compared to many American beers. The brett adds a fun dimension though, the moderate brett and moderate hopping synergize nicely to add up to more than the sum of their parts. The combination almost gives it a west-coast citrus/pine vibe although the beer is much more moderate, complex and understated than that.

A- A conservative pour still left a huge (3+ finger), fluffy, off-white head that was topped with a touch of yeast and never really completely fell, leaving huge sticky patches on the glass. The body was a combination of a deep red-brown with peach and pink accents with medium to heavy carbonation. It was all fairly clean considering the yeast pour.  S- It had a great aroma. It started as some spicy cloves and vanilla. Later on the yeasty qualities came through as green apple that became more pronounced with time and warmth.  T- It had an interesting flavor. It was more highly hopped than I'd expected, making for a dryish quality. There was a little granny smith apple from the funky yeast, and, maybe, a little lemon, citrus flair.  M- It was fairly heavily carbonated as I drank through the fluffy head. There was a definite hop and slight alcohol bite Overall, it was pretty dry on the palate.  D- The great attributes make me want more. Its alcohol was well masked making it an easy drinker and it's a wonderful example of the style.

Lemon/lime acidity. Peppery yeast.  Carbonation is light, almost microbeaded.  Taste is grassy & just barely soured. Very dry & mild, acidic hops upfront.

37,129,bobsy,4.5,"This is a bizarre beer, full of character, complexity and curiosity.  It pours a cloudy orange with a cumulonimbus of white head, that leaves huge gobs of foam on the side of the glass. Holy shit...its a beast of a beer to look at, but then when you get your nose in there its just mindblowing. The aroma is pure brett - cider, stable and leather. I've heard people say horseblanket, and though I've never been that close, I can agree that Orval probably does smell a bit like Mr. Ed's comforter. The taste is really funky, with spicy, fruity and herbal hints popping up. Lots of leather, cider and hay. Oh, and did I say funk? Later on it transitions to a lemon soapiness. What a complex and confusing beer this is!The mouthfeel and carbonation is remarkably soft and smooth for a lighter bodied beer. Wow, is it ever drying. More so than any other beer I've had.  A strange brew for sure, and stylistically leagues apart from its Trappist brethren. I didn't 'get' this beer in the past - it seemed like a strange goose and on the knife edge between love and hate. Over time, taste changes and the palate develops. Orval is a beast of a beer, and a classic. Everyone should try it.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,errantnight,4.75,"Simply a great beer, a classic, one of my favorites. Thanks to the brett and the widely varying storage conditions here in the states, each bottle is a little different.  This pours a notably orange hazy hue, a bit darker than I think of pale ales (or the saison I sometimes associate this with thanks to the funk), but it's an attractive pale color with a rich, creamy, mountainous head of craggy silky smooth foam with incredible retention and lacing. Just perfect. Exemplary.  Aroma is insanely complex, there's that ever present background of brett funk in there, not the sour twang, but the earthy barnyard and deep hints of citrus fruit. This compliments an earthy stew of pale malt with mild alcohol esters and phenols, a bit of banana and just faintest hints of warm spice, particularly nutmeg.  The taste is incredibly subtle and delicate, so perhaps for something I love so much so impeccably formulated it's a bit of a crime to knock this all the way down to 4.5, but I find that while there is a masterful retention of body here, the flavor thins out a bit towards the end. It's bone dry, but it's also just a tad watery on the back half of the palate, allowing the intense carbonation to come across very mineraly. What's there, though, builds in layers with each subsequent sip. There's a mild bready sweetness that pulls in the spice and fruit notes, bring out an impression of fresh flowers and springtime.  Having a beer this dry and still retaining a moderately full body is an astonishing accomplishment. There's really not much more to say. I know the high carbonation gives it its great looks, and probably greatly contributes to the early body I appreciate so much, but it sometimes feels a bit spritzier on the back palate than I would like. It's quibbling, and I could just as easily give this a 5 as a 4.5 and feel good about it.  I love this beer. It's pricey, and I don't drink it that often, but I never go too long between bottles, either. A classic, essentially perfect brew to be admired, and to influence others.

Mid-stream starts to show bitterness, but nothing involving hops. Finishes with an extremely sour, almost oxidized note. Acidic as all get out.  M - Carbonation bite is very noticeable. Makes this thing sting the tongue. Coats the mouth with a small amount of an oily texture.  D - Weighty on the palette and high in ABV, I don't find this beer to be extremely drinkable.

This looks like a tasty-ass beer float. I'm impressed. Smell is poignant hay, sour candy, and yeasty aromas. You would think the barnyard smell would be a turnoff, but it's actually quite intriguing. Taste is lightly juicy and fruity malts followed by tart grapefruit and some bitterness on the palate. The overall flavour is mild but well-executed. Mouthfeel is smooth with a nicely carbonated bite and a balanced, dry finish. I have enormous respect for this highly drinkable beer. The funky farm-like character is definitely something I haven't encountered before.

The pour is a hazy shade-lighter-than-copper with two fingers' white head. Retention and lacing are nice.  The nose is like a flowery version of gin--juniper mixed with floral notes. Some light citrus is also in there I can smell the alcohol, but it is in the background. The taste again contains juniper, flowers and citrus, but all are nicely balanced. Again, there is just a hint of the alcohol. The dry finish seems to last forever.  The mouthfeel is light, but not too light. Carbonation is nice and crisp. Drinkability is high; this is an exceptional sipping beer.  This is the most I've spent on a beer per ounce, and it is worth every penny.

37,129,ThirdLap,4.62,"Vinnie Cilurzo of Russian River has said in interviews that this is his favorite beer. As his brewing efforts have turned me on to a variety of beer styles, I figure Orval is worth a closer look.  Bottled on February 20, 2008, making it about 13 months old. Served at 50°F in a Russian River tulip.  Pours a cloudy medium tan that reminds me of unfiltered apple cider. The off-white two-finger thick head is chunky, uneven, and long-lasting.  The nose on Orval is pure brett, with characteristic wine and vinegar notes. Hints of citrus and spices round things out.  Taste is brilliant. If you enjoy Russian River's sours you will understand how this served as one of Vinnie's inspirations upon the very first sip. The huge brett aroma is muted in the taste, giving it a mild sourness, backed up by green apples and spice. Finish is bitter then dry, almost like champagne. The taste that remains between sips reminds me of Perrier. I'm thinking Orval may be the perfect way to introduce people to the idea of sourness in beer.  As with most proper Belgians, carbonation is huge. Body is right in the middle, and the 6.9% abv is well-masked.  Were it not for the price tag, I would probably pick Orval up much more often. Five bucks for a 33cl bottle is a bit steep, but somehow upon finishing it still seems like a fantastic bargain.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Brenden,4.36,"This one pours a very slightly hazy copper color. The head is incredible; huge, creamy and thick with the best retention I think I've ever seen. The head follows the whole way and leaves lacing all over the place. Pretty incredible, really.  The smell is a mix of flowery and sharp citrus, more like lemon than grapefruit, with an herbal note. Alcohol is evident but not overbearing. A slightly astringent scent finds its way in there as well.  A sharp hops bitterness hits first, but this one is complex. Herbal, floral and citrus tones blend very well with the hops for a nicely balanced brew. Very tart and tangy with a seemingly endless dry finish.  Mouthfeel is crisp, clean and dry in a fairly light body with good carbonation.

Beautiful citrus aroma hits my nose as I'm pouring it. Color is a gorgeous hazy orangish-brown. Lace drapes itself along the glass as the drink is consumed. Taste is nice and sweet initially and then hops come through in the finish. Hint of lemon, grapefruits and banana are there in the taste. A well balanced pale ale that is very smooth and refreshing. I highly recommend it.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,jbertsch,3.93,"Poured this into a tulip glass.  Appearance: Orangy and lively. It actually looks like it would have a bit of lemon in it. The highlight here is the huge sudsy, 3-4 finger head that caught me off guard. And it doesn't go anywhere soon. In fact the head stayed with the beer the entire time, following it down the glass instead of lacing. I noticed it would change funky formations after each sip.... was actually fun to watch. I need a life.  Smell: Banana bread - but not in a real sweet way. Floral, with notes of lemon and clove.  Taste: A bit more bitter than I thought it would be, and not as sweet as I was expecting. It's complex, but couldn't get a good sense of any one prominent flavor.  Mouthfeel: Prickly, sharp, almost felt like a more robust pilsner on the tongue.  Drinkability: It is definitely drinkable, but I wasn't yearning for a second.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

A- a dark golden colored body with at least 2 fingers of quickly receding fluffy looking white head. the head stays once it gets down to about a half of a finger and walls of lace are left behind.  S- very soft, very complex. summer fruit comes up first. apples, pears, grapes, and some lemon in there. theres something ""wild"" and a little sour smelling in here too.  T- the sourness isnt very intense at all, and not what i was expecting. very ""funky"" though. tastes like a barn would smell. theres some of the fruits i could smell in the taste as well, mostly lemon. might be from the hops.

37,129,dbtoe,4.23,"Poured from the bowling pin bottle into a Duvel tulip  Looks good, a light brown color with a very active white head. Smell is pretty faint, a little yeast and some lemon. Taste a lot going on here. Very complex a little sour, bitter and something I can't put my finger on. Every drink I pick up something a little different and all drinks finish with a very slight grapefruit bite. Feel all that carbonation is wonderful and every drink is smooth and finishes clean. Drink I could drink a lot of these and often. Comment I liked Orval a lot. It is a very unique beer that is full of surprises.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,amneziak,4.34,"Appearance: Right off the bat I have to say this beauty pours with about 14 fingers of massive pale white soapy looking head. Jeez Louise that's a massive stretch of foam! Additionally, it has a nice clear warm amber color. There is minimal cloudiness, and the immense amount of bubbles proves that this is a very vibrant beer.  Smell: I absolutely love the smell of Orval. There is a ton of banana bread and clove components right up front that are met up later by some funky lemon undertones. This beer really smells old world and the spices, for the most part, are very hard to pick apart. I also get a bit of alcohol presence in the nose which is odd since it only sits around 6.9% ABV.  Taste: Tastes almost identical to the smell. There is lots of banana bread in the mouth with a hint of lemon funk to back it up. Throughout the beer, several strange (yet enjoyable) floral components begin to come out. This is potentially due to the temperature change as you work through it. The lemon and funk essence that lies underneath is very reminiscent of a gueuze. In the end, you are left with a very nice deep banana taste on the tongue.  Mouthfeel: In terms of mouthfeel, this is more along the lines of how an IPA hits the palate than a Belgian style ale. It has lots of flavor and a well-rounded bitterness. There is also (as the pouring would insinuate) loads of effervescence that immediately slams into your tongue. In terms of body, this is not quite a medium-bodied beer, but close.  Overall: Of all the Trappist beers I've had so far, this is easily one of my favorite. I'm a huge fan of the whole banana bread and clove element of it. I will say it's maybe a touch too ""bubbly"" for my taste, but I can't really find a whole lot more to complain about. I'll definitely be picking up some more of these down the road.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,PirateUlf73,4.25,"Poured into a tulip glass.  A: Cloudy and golden-orange in color with a slightly off-white head. Retention and lacing were excellent. I could stare at this all day.  S: Aromas of soft wheat, a variety of fruity complexity and some twangy yeast notes. Bright and crisp, fruity and bready, all in one.  T: Soft and bready up front with hints of apple, banana and some lemon. Yeast adds its own magic to the mix, but the aftertaste surprised me somewhat, coming off as dry and almost stale.  M: Lighter end of medium-bodied and well-carbonated, but not overly so. Beer feels nice and silky on the tongue.  D: Goes down really smooth, and rewards sipping and savoring.  Nice blend of flavors. The feel was heavenly and it is massively drinkable. Not the best Trappist beer I've had, but its tasty, quaffable nature was a welcome reprieve from some of the heavier, knock-out beers I've tried recently.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,cdrogers,5,"First, I have to admit I'm somewhat biased when it comes to the Belgium Trappist ales. I've had nearly everyone, except a Rochefort, including the Westvleteren 12, several Chimay, Westmalle tripel, but this is my favorite right behind the Westvleteren 12.  Pour: Poured from the bottle into a traditional orval siliver-rimmed goblet at about 45 degrees.  Smell: The smell reminds me a lot of a mint-chocolate cookie, with just a hint of the mint.  Taste: Very smooth taste. Mild hoppy flavor with a slight bitterness on the back of the tongue.  Head: Truly one of the best heads of any ale. Very thick through most of the glass, starts to evaporate toward the end.  Drinkability: This is one I have the pleasure of keeping in the house quite often and drink it a lot. Not a cheap one but the stronger alcohol content makes it one you don't need many of, if that's the goal.  Exceptional and highly recommend.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,scruffwhor,5,"Pours a lovely golden amber, great effervescant bubbling, and the perfect thick foamy head and stickage with every sip. The picture of Belgian pale ale. Crisp hrbal spice aroma, that evens out with sweet honey like malts and maybe an earthy hop finish. This smells awesome, no other words needed. Starts out with a dry biscuit malt and honey sweetness with a splash of tea-like spices. The dryness turns to a gentle, tart apple skin. Complex palate starts sweet and finishes dry to tart. Lots of flavors and textures to this beer. I'm glad this beer is sold individually instead of via a six-pack and such. Also the $4 and up price in my area, really makesyou apprecite this beer that much more eery time you buy it.

37,129,bartle,4.07,"From the cool looking 11.2 oz. brown bottle into a crystal chalice.  A - Poured a fantastic hazy orange copper body with a thick cream head. The head was rocky foam. Very appealing to the eye.  S. - A dry, bitter sent of pine and mild citrus. Reminded me of walking through an evergreen forest spiked with a citrus zest.  T. - Dry and bitter with floral overtones. A bitter, yet clean taste. Bitter sweet and beautiful. The citrus really matches the dominate floral aroma. Earthy and balanced.  M. - Smooth even when being a little heavy on the carbonation. The body of the beer just lingers in my mouth and on the back of my tongue. This beer is forceful, it makes you savor every moment. That being said, long after it's gone, it leaves a soft feeling on the taste buds.  D. - Simply for it's unique character I will be drinking this again. It is not my favorite of the trappist ales,though it holds a beauty of its own. It's soft, smooth, bitter and beautiful.  I wish fine beers like this were more readily available in bars, pubs, and lcbo's in Canada.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,joshuadlight,4.09,"If you've never had an Orval, this is one very unique beer. Not many look, smell, or taste anything like it. Even at a slow pour it produces a swelling head that is very chunky. I mean, this leaves big chunks of lacing on the glass. Unique yeast flavors and aromas coupled with some sweet fruits. There is a slight bite at the end with some yeast/hop bitterness that sticks around in your throat for a while. At first I thought the aftertaste was unpleasant, but after a couple sips I came to enjoy the flavor very much. As attested to by the large head, this is a very carbonated beer, detracting only slightly from the mouthfeel. I also had to account for the large pricetag when I took away from the drinkability. If it didn't run $6 per 11.2 oz, it would be perfectly drinkable.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,BARFLYB,4.45,"Single bottle purchased at Joe Canal's in Jersey. Poured into a St. Bernardus glass on a cold night.  A- Orval pours out a hazy yellow to bright golden color with bubbles seen rising. These bubbles produce a sturdy foamy off white head with staying power. Huge sheets of lace were left on the glass.  S- This one is on the wild side with an apparent brett addition giving off a slight tart twang. Also alot of Belgian yeast on top of some hops and malt additions as well. Maybe some sweetness or candy like essence.  T- I really enjoy the brett addition which makes this not over the top sour but pleasently tart. This is followed by a belgian yeast variety with a very faint hop bite, which is common in most Belgian's I've had of not being hop dominate. Some candi sweetness ensues leaving a nice aftertaste.  M- This BPA is well carbonated and it is felt on the tounge, maybe a bit too much. This leads to a very crisp mouthfeel but that fades as this one warms up. Thin to semi medium bodied with no alcohol in the mouth, just great flavor.  D- I could drink this all night at the alcohol level without ever getting bored. I love brett infused beers and this is one of the leading examples. I had this once in my early drinking days and hated it.

I smell some fruity aromas, Raisins and figs along with some citrusy aromas.  Tastes somewhat like it smells, a bit fruity, low carbonation.  Feels very smooth. Creamy going down.  Very drinkable.

37,129,superdedooperboy,4.06,"Poured from the ubiquitous 11.2 oz. bowling pin-shaped Orval bottle into a goblet. Bottled on 09/07/2008, with a Best Before date five years from bottling.  Pours a deep, hazy amber hue, giving rise to a humongous light tan head that fills half the vessel. The foam settles very slowly to a thick half-finger that sticks around for the remainder of the drink, leaving thick, broken sheets of lace behind on the walls of the glass.  A very earthy aroma fills the nose, with lemon zest combining with spicy yeast notes, damp earth and a slight mustiness.  A rather light, effervescent body holds within it a mildly spicy brew with a thick underlying base of toasted biscuit. Hops mingle with the yeasty spiciness, keeping in check what little malty sweetness is present. The finish is very dry, with a bit of a grassy aftertaste that lingers.  Nice, refreshing, highly distinctive and absolutely gorgeous to look at, this is one Trappist ale that is well worth its lofty praise and honorable status. Watch out for the 6.9% ABV, though, as it can sneak up just as easily as the beer goes down.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Madigan,3.8,"I tend to steer clear of Trappist ales because although I recognise their craft and quality I generally prefer beers under 6 abv but Orval at 6.2 is pretty light. The colour was interesting, paler than I expected, sort of orange, and the mouthfeel was great - a good strong taste but not too much alcohol. It's a very clean, dry beer and goes down exceptionally well. I imagine it would go very well with some decent cheese.  A nice, accessible Belgian ale and one I'll definitely be trying again.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,BBThunderbolt,4.67,"Bottled on 9/13/07. Poured into Chalice (gotta get a tuilp!). Poured a deep, dark yellow, almost orange. Slightly hazy, this beer is darker than most Pales. A big fluffy head of tight bubbles that dissipated quickly leaving no lacing. A noticeable apple aroma with some spice tones, no apparent yeast scent. The dry, apple flavor follows the aroma without the acidity of cider. The spiciness is reminiscent of apple pie to a small degree. A full, smooth, balanced body. Very drinkable, I could have several of these in row with no trouble. A wonderful beer that is slightly different than most of the style.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,drtth,4.4,"Bottled 27 Dec., 2007. Chilled and poured into Duvel glass and allowed to warm before tasting. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically.  Appearance: Deep dark golden orange color with a faint haziness. Very thick white fluffy/pillowy white head that takes a very long time to recede, leaving lacing and patches of foam around the glass  Smell: The immediate smell is of fresh fruits or flowers, with a hint of lemon. In the background there is a hint of a faint musty or leather character that I'm told becomes more pronounced with bottle age.  Taste: The flavors are initially slightly sweet, fruity, and crisp. The crisp dryness continues as other flavors come into play and remind me a bit of tart cider. One of the flavors that emerges midway through definitely reminds me of leather. The presence of hops is hard to detect except through their dry bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied and crisp with prickly carbonation. The finish is long with a dry, lightly bitter character that begins midway and lasts until its is hard to say when it ends.  Drinkability: The operative word for this beer is ""complexity."" While the price might give me second thoughts I could drink more than one of these, but this is such a complex brew more than one might be excess. This is a beer one should revisit periodically both to increase one's appreciation and to refresh one's memory.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Aromas are of light brett funk, some vinegar, spices, and orange citrus.  Taste is light on the mouth, but quite flavorful. Some very slightly sweet creamy malts, dusty, flour, dough, and light funk. Finish is smooth, with some crispness, a dry feel, lemon zest and light mineral hops.  Mouthfeel is kind of thin, and a little watery. Not bad though.  Drinkability is really good.

37,129,Larrytown,4.2,"Pours an orangish-brown with a big head that fades quickly to a solid, consistent ring. The fruit is the first thing noticed off the bat with a bit of malt and hops playing around the edges.  The taste is dry and spicy. Definitely wine-like and there's no trouble seeing the champagne comparisons with such a crisp mouthfeel. It jumps out at you.

37,129,jjazz,3.99,"Crazy cavernous head with great lacing. Pale orangey color.  Aromatic intensity is low/medium, with malty sweetness, and a bit of lemony hops. Urine is also present, but not in an offensive way.  Taste is all over the map, with hop notes accompanied by sour cherries, mild unripe banana, tobacco, and more. Snappy tartness in the finish. Highly complex with fairly low volume. Unique and impressive in its complexity, but not as appealing as what many Belgians have to offer.  Very light body with ample carbonation. A bit more body would be appreciated, and it wouldn't hurt the drinkability at all.  I don't quite know what to think. Unique and drinkable, but not down right delicious like my favorite Belgians/trappists. I would like to try it again, but it'll be tough to convince myself to spend the $5 when I could get so many other great Belgians that I already know I love.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

A little citrusy smell, then spices--clove, cinnamon, and nutmeg.  Bitter green hops at first, then spicecake taste in the finish.  Overall, quite dry with some mild notes of sweet. At first it is creamy, as the carbonation works its magic, then finishes light and dry.  This is one of the most drinkable of the Trappist ales and should be a favorite with hopheads; it's lightness makes it a nice thirst quencher and at only 6.9% ABV, you can enjoy a few.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Why does it take 5 minutes to pour an 11 oz. bottle?  Smells medicinally, soapy, of grass hops, and faintly of spices. Taste is a muddled mess. I actually like the slightly sour taste and lemony bite, but it doesn't meld well with the bit of horse blanket, fresh hay/grass hops, and medicinal herbiness.  Just really strange.

I smell the grain, but I don't really smell what I normally recognize as the smell of hops. I'm actually having trouble putting my finger on any smell I can compare this to.  Taste: slight banana, slightly sweet grain, wine-like note (tannins?), a bit acidic. Some other fruit?  Mouthfeel: very carbonated, not what I'd call a smooth moutfeel  High drinkability.  I liked it, but I'd be interested in trying a fresh bottle. I didn't actually know this one was so old.

Upon pouring I can tell the Brett has taken over, but at first sip I see that it's also not fully developed. When this beer is fresh, it's a relatively hoppy Belgian, but thanks to the addition of wild brettanomyces it turns into a lambic. After a year, however, the tangy lemon sour aren't strong and rich enough to complete the beer.

It slowly settles leaving thick lacing on the glass.  Aroma is heavenly - sweet, fruity, and spicy yeast. It's truly something special before I even taste it.  The taste is unique as well. It's full of classic Belgian fruit esters and spicy yeast. The most surprising thing for me is strong bitterness and the super dry finish. It has a champagne quality to it which leads me to mouthfeel.  This is where Orval beer suffers a little for me. The body is fine but the carbonation is over the top. It feels like it's foaming up in my mouth.  Drinkability is good and it's not too strong compared with most Belgians we get here in the states.

High carbonation and a medium body - hop taste was less than I feared (which is a good thing for this malt head).  Dare I say a session ale?

There are intense floral and spice notes, as well as hints of bubblegum and sweet candy sugar, with just a touch of earthy must in the background from the yeast.  Taste: Quite floral up front, with slight musty/yeasty and tart lemon and peach flavors as well. Then come lightly toasted malts and a bit of a bitter hop smack at the end.  Mouthfeel: High carbonation and light-medium body...perfect for the style.  Drinkability: 1-2 of these would be nice; it's too complex and the alc. is a bit too high to have more than a couple in a sitting.  Conclusion: This particular sample was bottled in 2008 and it says it drinks well until 2013; with this being a very fresh sample, I'd like to buy another and let it mellow in the cellar a bit. As delicious as this is, I think a year or two might mellow it out a little and take the edge off the hop and alcohol presence. That being said, this is a delicious Trappist offering...its spicy and floral characteristics remind me of a good Alsace Gewurtztraminer, and I think I'd actually prefer this one with food even more than on its own...perhaps some Camembert and crusty French bread?",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,kaseydad,4.35,"Beautiful caramal color with a nice creamy head that has massive staying power.  Smells of fruit and and is very well carbonated.  An initial spicy, tangy taste hits the tongue followed by a hint of grape at the swallow.  A nice mild lingering aftertaste is present with each sip.  I really like the combination of foam with each sip. It really brings out the nice aspects of this great beer.  Very well done.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,ljbrisson,3.75,"Cracked this in celebration of my wife and I buying our first house! Poured an absolutely beautiful slightly cloudy orange into my Duvel glass with a voluminous, off-white 2-finger head that shows great retention. Aroma is strongly of orange and citrus. Mouthfeel is very light and there is a lot of carbonation. Taste is... well I've never tasted anything like this before. I was expecting much more fruitiness, based on the aroma. Instead there are a lot of flavors I'm not familiar with - I can only describe it as very ""wild"". Wood? Dried grass? Earthiness? A very dry finish and none of the acidic tang that the aroma suggests. Very smooth, though drinkability might not be as high as other brews due to the sheer complexity of flavors.  Overall I enjoy this beer, although am totally befuddled by it. I would try this again just to try to wrap my mind about what I'm tasting.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,beveritt,4.06,"Presentation: Poured from the classically shaped 11.2 oz Orval bottle into a Duvel tulip. Bottle clearly states Bottled On: 05/06/2008 and Best Before: 05/06/2013A. Not sure what the A is for, but come on. How hard is it to put this stuff on labels? Thank you Orval.  Appearance: Pours with an amazingly dense 4 fingered head of nearly white foam. This settles very slowly and hardly at all, still retaining most of its original height. Where it has dropped, the lacing is thick and sticky. Amazing. The beer itself is cloudy and orange.  Smell: Fairly forward hop aroma, with hints of oranges and cloves. Citrus aromas become more prevalent as the drink warms.  Taste: Mild spicy, piney hops upfront. Hop bitterness lingers well after each sip. Very bready/yeasty flavor. Slight sourness as the beer warms.  Mouthfeel: Higher than average carbonation level. Body is good.  Drinkability: Well, what can I say? Supposedly the classic example of the style, and while it displayed numerous subtle flavors, they were just too subtle for my taste. I can appreciate it for what it represents, but can't see myself hitting it up again.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,bonkers,4.07,I poured from a 11.2 ounce bottle into a tulip glass. It pours an orange/yellow with enormous white head. The beer leaves lots of lacing and a white littlt cap on top. The aroma is of fresh lemons. The flavor is slightly sweet with a hint of phenol. The finish is crisp. The beer is medium body and IMO overcarbonated. The beer is very drinkable.,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,kbnooshay,4.65,"Pour this super slow, its gonna grow on you. Poured a gloriously hazy golden amber with a huge super frothy-foamy off white head. Lots of carbonation rising to the top. Creamy and very complete coating in terms of lacing. Head looks like a root beer float head floating around on a melting cream base.  Aroma is spectacular. Full of pepperiness, clove, fruit(orange lemon) and honey! The light sour twang of brett yeast is always welcome.  More of the same awesomeness as described above. Super yeasty, musty and lightly sour. Peppery and only slightly drying. Citric.  Feel is creamy and slick but tingly from the carbonation. I would gladly drink more than one of these bowling pin shaped brews but i would almost feel guilty. So damn good.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,ricke,4.45,"Serving date: 2009-01-20. Served in snifter.  Presentation: 330 ml bottle. Bottling date and freshness date on label (Bottled 2008-06-20, best before 2013-06-20). Recommended serving temperature and glassware on label.  Appearance: The beer is amber-colored with red hues, and a bit hazy due to the bottle conditioning and the rather large amount of yeast in the bottle (left most of it in the bottle, though). It develops a big, bubbly and uneven head, despite poured in a quite wide-bodied snifter. The head is almost white, with a light yellow/orange shade, and settles very very slowly. It actually never disappear. Instead it leaves a thick coat of foam. Rocky and airy lacings clings to the glass. This one really pleases the visual faculty.  Smell: Lemon, grass, weeds and sweet, fruity aromas, coupled with a pleasant smell of yeast.  Taste: Lemon peel is mixed with yeast and very faint notes of unripe tart fruits. A hint of pine needles is there as well. Then, a taste of grass and hey enters the picture together with a very mild barnyard funkiness (horse blanket?). Just before the finish, it develops a sharp twang - perhaps a result of hops. The finish is tart at first, then develops a subtle bitterness leaving a long and dry sensation in the mouth. Overall, the taste of this beer is really great with levels of complexity. Basically every sip offers something new. However, the true highlight is the balance between the different flavors - everything is composed in a precise and very pleasant manner.  Mouthfeel: As with the taste, this beer offers a rather unique mouthfeel. At first, with the plentiful foam playing an important part, it's quite smooth and full. However, this quickly changes into a a medium, almost light, body with the lively carbonation providing a sharp and crisp feeling to it.  Drinkability: This is a fantastic beer with an original and unique profile. A true masterpiece from start to finish.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,turamarth,4.18,"Poured into Smokestack Chalice.  Appearance: A nice hazy golden brown color. Explodes with a huge rocky head with a medium pour. Excellent retention and leaves nice lacing.  Nose: Every thing seems fairly subtle. But, there is a nice hop presence up front, sort of grassy. Some candied malts maybe fruity esters also peeks through in the nose.  Taste: This beer might be one of the most complex I've tasted so far. Granted this is my first foree into Belgian ales. There is very subtle grassy/hay flavor. But, most of the taste is buried in estery brettonomyces. Fruits are delicious. Theres even a slight sharp cheeseiness. Truly complex, almost too so for my palate at this stage.  Mouth: Nice light smooth mouthfeel, nice carbonation. Leaves the mouth with a hint of thickness.  Drink: This beer is almost too complex for one to have multiples. Though abv isn't very high. I like this beer. It's a special occasionier.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,coalcracker,4.38,"Appearance: Pours a dark golden color with billowy head that clings heavily to the glass like cobwebs. Smell: Very fruity and tart aroma. Quite unique. Base malt aroma almost buried here. Taste: Sharp fruitiness upon tasting, tart and a bit bitter (but not overpowering). Malts bring forth notes of caramel and fig through the middle of the tasting. The taste profiles begin to meld and tame as the beer warms. A dry aftertaste hangs around for a bit. Mouthfeel: Smooth and moderate-bodied despite the taste profile lurking above. Drinkability: Based upon this beer's complexity, I would certainly savor this slowly and not in a session. In that respect- very drinkable.  Overall: One of the first brews introduced to me on my journey to beerdom- I couldn't recall the complexity of this beer. Not everyone will dig this. Me? I'll take this masterpiece anyday.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,dolemite77,4.05,"Pours hazy orange, with a mammoth rocky head. Aroma is sour and horsey when cold, more perfume like as it warms. Flavor is very funky. The bottle I had was around 1.5 years from bottling. The wild yeasts in this one bring out the horsebarn, sour apples, and dry dry dry finish. Very interesting beer. My new years resolution is to try more of the ""wild type"" beers. This is the most famous user of brett fermentation, so might as well start it out here.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,bowersdm,2.66,"I reviewed this a while ago and I decided to revisit tonight. My first review gave this beer a 'C'.  33cL bottle poured into my St. Bernardus goblet;  A - cloudy amber almost brown color. Because of the extreme carbonation, it took about five minutes to get this beer into the glass. There was a stiff 2.5cm tall off-white head that disintegrated into pillowy lumps that looked like a scale model of a group of sand dunes  S - yeast, spice, cherries, apples, oranges, lemons, and grass. There was also a funkiness going on too. I can't figure out what it is.  T - spicy fruitiness, a slight funky taste that, though it was slight, make the beer not that great because it's really about the only thing going on. There was also some spicy/citrusy hops at the end.  M - way, way too much carbonation.  D - I still do not enjoy the taste of this beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,prsguitarsr4me,4.5,"My 50th review - I'm glad its on a good brew! This poured a hazy straw blonde, with a great head with great retention - all the way to the last sip. Aroma wasn't as interested as I've seen in other Belgian ales, but was nice. Taste is similar to Duvel, but I like Duvel more. Very sweet and smooth - that fantastic Belgian taste that it seems only the Belgians can get.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,tmoneyba,4.22,"Very interesting brew.  Aroma was a strong yeast, hop with spice.  Poured a cloudy dark amber color with a large rocky head that lasted with good lacing.  Flavor was very complex with the same spicy complex finish of moderate duration with a small bite of alcohol.  Good brew and is one of my top rated active bottled beers for the Belgian Ale style.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,meatmallet,4.4,Appearance: Hazy amber colored beer with one of the best heads around. Tons of lace and an amazing stream of carbonation rising from the bottom of the galss.  Smell: A very powerful smell that really stands out. Sweet and full of spice with notes of orange and lemon.  Taste: Tastes like it smells with lemon being the dominating flavor and spice. Bread and hopps and a slight banana taste also make an appearance but they are not as dominant as the lemon and spice.  Mouthfeel/drinkability: Carbonation is great and the bitter aftertaste eases up as you drink it. Very crisp finish.,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,dancinwillie,4.6,"A: Pours a hazy brownish/dark orange. Very active, it took me 4 tries to get it all poured. Topped by a giant, fluffy white head. Spotty chunks of foam lacing remain on the glass. Hazy.  S: Musty funk, or funky must. Leather and vinegar. Brett.  T: Quite a bit of hop bitterness up front, which surprised me a little. Quickly followed by everything from the aroma: leather, vinegar, must be the brettomyces (sp?). Underneath though, is a restrained fruitiness, reminiscent of a good saison. Apple/pear flavors, and a real slight hint of banana. Still manages to have some tame carmel flavors too. Somewhat sour, although tartness might better describe it. Very good taste here. It keeps going, and you pick up different things with each blessed sip.  M: Highly carbonated, very active beer. Medium in body, with a soft, smooth finish. Rich, earthy aftertaste lingers.  D: High. What can I say that hasn't been said? This is an absolutely delicious beverage. The only thing stopping me from drinking this on a regular basis, is the almost $5/bottle price tag. Still, a nice treat every once in awhile. And, if like me, you try it, and don't like it, wait a year or two, and give it another go. It worked for me. I couldn't taste anything here 2 years ago. Just tasted bland. But now, well, I feel like the trout just returned MY gold ring. Cheers, and thanks to the brothers at Orval.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Lacing was persistent with every sip and every swirl.  S - Of dishsoap. Almost fishy. Hints of pine and clove were discovered. Rather mild in aroma, overall.  T - Spicy, soapy flavor. Tart fruits and a touch of smooth grain (rye) enveloped this beer. Some note of alcohol present with a mild hop-bitterness. Hint of lemony zing in the finish. It got warmer, presenting more spiciness. Then, at almost room temp, it became mild again.  M - Medium-bodied. With a carbonation that lingers in the finish.  D - Remarkably easy drink.

A - a very frothy beverage we have here, I could not finish pouring the whole of the bottle, only about 1/8 left though, so not so bad. a dark amber color with a medium opacity, bubbles emanating from the bottom, and a big head that settles down to a more manageable size.  S - now I know I'm going to sound a bit fruity (no pun intended), but the beer actually smells like a mulled apple cider. scouts honor; and a damn good one at that! the spice is complex and right on the same level with the apple smell, and lingering in the background is the faint smell of booze.  T - the first thing I wish to comment on is the dryness of the alcohol. the quality is like that of a brut champagne, that makes you slow down, sip, and respect the drink. my cheeks pinch a bit at the bitter dryness and I love it. now, not to be unnoticed is the spiciness of the brew, like a really dulled down sailor jerry's or captain morgan, the same type of spices, I am unfamiliar, so please forgive me. the apple scent is still there in the taste, which makes it seem like a cider more than a beer to some degree, if anyone has tried S. Smith's organic cider, than they shall know of what I speak. but what keeps this from tasting like a cider is the hops bite and the zestyness of lemon that hits the tongue and reminds me that, indeed, this is one hell of a beer.

Body is an orange amber, really looks majestic. Nose is quite full, lots of grass, brett, and a honey-lemon.  Beer keeps its carbonation during the sip, big bubble feeling. Feel is quite light and crisp. Flavor is light, with a grass hop finish.  Very tastey, and obviously well constructed. ABV isn't absurd for this Belgian, so it makes a decent session.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,WYVYRN527,4.32,"Poured into a goblet from a bottle, Orval pours a hazy amber, almost orange hue with an aggresive frothy white head that thins after a few minutes. The aroma at first is fruity and sour, with hints of banana and tart fruits. It is followed up by a spicy hop aroma. The flavor is immense. Fruity, with hints of spice, candi sugar, and that earthy, signature Brettanomyces funk. It finishes dry and clean, with great hop character that is unlike other Trappist ales. Orval is a medium bodied brew. The flavor only lasts from sip to swallow. Not much lingering on the palate. It is, however, very easy to drink. Not my favorite beer from the seven Monastaries, but definitely up there on the list.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Smell: Sweet and flowery, like a peach bubble-gum on a virgins butt. Some yeast can be hinted in the background.  Taste: Yeasty fruitiness along with a sour finish, greatly mellifluous to the smell.  Mouthfeel: Medium full and rather rough to the palate, the carbonation brings a fresh sensation, without being blatantly upfront.  Drinkability: I surely enjoyed this one, and it deserves recommendation due to the flavour-to-scent resonance and overall high character- On a side note worth mentioning is the fact that it's very similar to a Biere de Garde, (or is it vice versa?)",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Other brewers please adopt this. Pours a hazy amber with huge meringue-like head. Smell: green apple, yeast funk, orange peel, lemon zest, ginger?, hay, grassiness. Taste: spice cake, honey graham crackers, green grapes, green apple, toffee, more sour yeast funkiness, what I'd imagine hay tastes like. Tangy, soft, medium bodied. This is one is insane, from the ridiculously large head to the ultra funky yeast and the complexities it brings.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,KeefD,4.53,"Poured this one into a La Fin Du Monde tulip. Upon a slow pour a huge head developed that stuck around forever whilst becoming rocky and wonderful. The head sits on top of a pale amber body with golden edges. It's only somewhat hazy as I left most of the sediment in the bottle. Aroma is of sour banana right off the bat, followed up by the famous barnyard funk and hint of apple cider. I've hadd this beer in the past but don't remember it being so sour and funky smelling. The flavor is not as in-your-face funktastic sour as the nose, but it does have that going for it. It's sour, but in a pleasing sort of way. Flavors of ripe fruits, Belgian candy sugar, light acidity, a bit of licorice, and it has a nice hop bitterness on the finish. Body is medium (I think) but it's hard to tell with so much carbonation, which gives it a drying champagne like quality on the tongue. I can't normally see my self drinking too many sour/funky beers in one sitting, but this is so delicious I could easily see myself drinking a couple of these in a night. This is probably the most unique of the Trappist ales and it's one that everyone should try at least once.

Head remains throughout. Taste: GREAT! I was taken aback. It's very complex and fruity. It's so good that even my Dad loved it when I gave him a sip and he hates complicated beers. Mouthfeel: Not the best. Very bubbly but it isn't harsh on the tongue. Overall: I've put this one off for a very long time. I passed it over for years. I wish I hadn't. It's unreal.

37,129,TMB0424,4.75,"11.2 oz bottle poured into snifter  Poured a beautiful hazy peach body with a massive, pillowy white head. Clung to my glass for its life, excellent lacing and retention. Simply a work of art.  Aroma is of zesty orange peel, lemon rind, other citrus. Cherries, granny smith apples in the background. The scent of the Belgian yeast in this brew is intoxicating by itself. Cloves and a peppery aroma back up the citrus in full force. Vinous, grape-like as well... champagne-like.  Taste is of honey dipped citrus (orange peel once again) but is backed up by a sour/tart element that is indescribably perfect. Once the initial hit of citrus fades away, a nice twang of lemon tartness kicks in, followed by a very dry finish. The finish is peppery and warming as well. The yeast... I can't even explain. Leathery, funky - it's perfect. The vinous character is evident once again as in the aroma.  High carbonation, medium full bodied brew. Very bready and chewy. Has a certain distinct creamy mouthfeel to it. The clove, pepper, lemon finish leaves a somewhat funky (in a good way) lacing in my mouth. To continue the wine-like trend, it's almost tannic. Extremely long lasting and even moreso pleasureable.  Drinkable? Oh yeah. This is what Belgian beer is all about. The complexity of this beer is mind boggling as each sip can bring out different elements in this brew. This is a must try for any Belgian lover (or beer lover for that matter). Truly an experience.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Very big aroma of spicy fruits. Sharp orange zest and hints of pepper. Flavor is tart citrus, yeasts, and mild malts. This is only the second time I have tried this beer.

Smells like a champagne, very fruity, grapes stand out most.  Taste is similarly fruity with a very dry finish. Again grapes and maybe a tiny hint of a citrus fruit are present. While it is very good, I would have preferred a little more definition.  Mouthfeel is high carbon and thin..a beer with this flavor would be too flat any other way.  As for drinkability, I would buy this again in a pinch if selection is limited, but would likely pass this over in most situations. It's good, but doesn't scream for me to come back to it immediately.

Some reviewers talked about lacing, I didn't notice any.  Good Belgian smell, spices, citrus, dark fruit with a little bit of funkiness/earthiness.  Good taste. Spiciness, citrus, dark fruit and a nice slightly bitter hoppy finish.  Mouthfeel is rich, and pricks the taste buds with spiciness and carbonation.  Drinkability is good.

Pears, apples, spices, a hint of alcohol, and a vague urine odor. Over all very nice.  Taste- honey and apple and berry flavors, paired with spices and toffee, and a mustard-like flavor as well. Swallow is yeasty, and the aftertaste is hoppy and warm.  Mouthfeel- very crisply carbonated, not *bad* but on the high end of good, also fairly dry, especially on the warm finish. After letting the glass sit for a few minutes, the carbonation has calmed a bit and the mouthfeel is much silkier and smoother.  Drinkability- pretty good.

For all of his ""blonde bombshell"" and ""lose your innocence"" advertising... The head of the fearless Trappist monk's beer destroyed his.

AS IF the walls upon walls of lace that they trail behind them could even be touched by any other beer... Sunset, I suppose, as the glowing white cotton-balls... nay, whipped cream, sits atop a deep amber/light mahogany body... perfect clarity, those adventurous, persnickety bubbles march on up the walls, many in number.

There's the malt backbone of a Tripel... nothing has done this before. The depth of the thing... is this a saint or a monster? Caramel, butterscotch, white pepper... all overridden by the immense cave-deep barrel, the light sour, the earth, hops that have been buried for years... For the flavor... Some metal. Like that level, Nebulous, on Jet Moto... you're in heaven, the clouds, the classical music... then you dive down and there are raging guitars (in the form of Brett sour and a light copper-esque metallic note), potholes in the road, a ""swiss cheese"" flat stretch, then a solid, lingering, belgian-waffle-biscuit in the end. The hops that exist are dank, earthy, despondent. The clouds carry into the feel of the thing... light, airy, bubbly, dry. The sourness pushes the dryness down the back of the throat...

Fruits like orange, cherry and apple all seem to be fighting in there along with hints of sweet malts to balance it and a touch of spicing.

There is also a distinct allusion to a fine Champagne (recurring theme, I know!).  How about that mouthfeel?! It's like there is a party in my mouth and the Swedish bikini team is invited! Again, Champagne-like constant carbonation.  The flavor, for me, leaves a little to be desired. I am getting a lot of brett and sourness. Maybe some sour orange juice.

37,129,Hojaminbag,4.33,"A slightly hazy copper to rust colored body. Huge, rocky, lumpy, off-white head. Great retention as the head settles into a thick lumpy ring on top of the beer. Lively carbonation bubbles move throughout the body. Honestly, this looks a little bit like an IPA.  The smell is really tart. Not a really stong sour aroma, just a slightly musty type of sour from a moderate does of brettanomyces. The kind that people refer to as ""horse blanket"" or ""barnyard."" I don't like either of these descriptions because they don't sound appealing at all, but I feel people will understand me when I use them. A noticeable hop aroma that is floral and grassy is there too.  The tartness I noticed in the nose is definitely the main flavor in this beer. Most noticeable up front, the tart flavor continues throughout the entire body of the beer. Next a good, really hay or grassy tasting hop profile comes through. The tartness and this hop profile work great together. Underneath these two dominant flavors comes some sweet belgian malt to round it out. From start to finish Orval is tasty, complex and interesting.  This probably has the liveliest mouthfeel I have ever encountered. The carbonation is huge; I'd say more highly carbonated than a soda. Fairly light body. It is a little strange, but I do think this mouthfeel works.  Interesting flavors combine with an extremely light feeling body to make a really drinkable beer. I can't believe I had not tried orval until now, definitely a great beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,phishgator,4.68,"Poured into an Orval glass. The Light Golden hue with the heavy carbonation and big fluffy head make this a beautiful beer to behold. The aroma is of meadow grass and a hint of the farm. The taste is a drying bitterness with a clean earthy tone. There is a sense of tartness, but without being tart. The body is light and airy. A beer that you wish could be drank everyday. A very unique flavor and aroma that I can't say I've had anywhere else.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Taste: There is a lightly toasted malt, floral, bananas, and sweet bread yeast. There is some hints of leather, straw, phenols, papery, and pears.  Overall. A very nicely balanced Belgium pale ale. There is a good malt with a delicate but well put hop flavor. The mouth feel is astringent and slightly powdery. The finish is bitter and it last. I felt that the beer finish was inviting me to drink more. The more I drink I felt that this beer had a 3-d complex coming to life in my mouth. I rather enjoyed this beer.

37,129,yesyouam,4.26,"Orval is a shimmering and clear amber ale with a very soft off-white head that lasts forever and leaves excellent lacing. The aroma is of a dusty dank cellar, soft sweet grain, bread and berries and herbs. It is very soft and smooth and medium bodied. Great balance! It is bitter and tart, but softly so. There is a lemon/lime flavor in there. The hops are a bit like juniper, cranberry and rosemary. It's so classic! I love it! (rated Aug 21, 2007)",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,MerkinMan,3.93,"A: Orange / Copper hue. Head settles into a nice fluffy layer. A little cloudy (bottle conditioned).  S: Faint caramel and alcohol scents. Not a very aromatic beer (at this point). Faint fruit esters. How do you rate a beer that is hard to smell? The smell reveals some complexity, but it is hard to find.  T: Hard to describe at first taste. Reminiscent (at first) of white wine or champagne with some citrus notes (more orange / tangerine than grapefruit -- not from hops). Minty hop tastes linger for a little while. Finishes dry with a slight metallic edge.  As it warms, caramel and dark cherry cordial (faint) flavors develop in the aftertaste along with tobacco and cloves. The complexity is in the finish. I seem to taste more of what this beer has to offer after I swallow it.  MF: The mouthfeel is the biggest achievement here. Light and effervescent. Certainly comes alive on the palate.  D: A fine beer. I admit that I may raise my expectations too high when I see the words ""trappist"" or even ""Belgian"" on the label. A fine beer, but it did not knock my socks off -- maybe I was expecting that too much. There are certainly examples of this style I like better. I am happy I tried it, and would never turn it down.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Reagan1984,4.2,"Bottle dated with ""bottled on 12/27/2007""  Other than the color, this really looked like a champagne. The head was a very light and active at first. Really looked like a champagne head, but then started to act differently and showed some structure. The beer is a bright orange amber color and was crystal clear with some nice visible carbonation. Again, appearing in this manner a bit like champagne. Some tiny splotches of lace, but not much.  The aroma was sharp and fruity with a nice amount of earthiness. I smell some pear. You can also detect the yeast.  The flavor helped me continue my champagne these here. Very tart, light and delicate. Light fruits, a decidedly light sour flavor that again reminds me of nice champagne. I get some more pear notes and also tart green apple. The difference is towards the end where some nice hop character comes through. This is where I like the flavor as the distinctive Belgian yeast flavors meld nicely with the hop bitterness. My fridge is set for 46 degrees, so I believe I started drinking this at the proper temp. Having said that, I still enjoyed it as it warmed slightly. It really opened up nicely and you could really get a better sense of the malt flavors.  The mouth feel is very light and effervescent. Dry and crisp at the finish. Definitely a delicate brew and one to be treated as such. One I think I would enjoy in the summer.  I am happy that my taste has matured enough to really enjoy this. Several years ago I would not have enjoyed this as much.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,jasonjlewis,3.5,"Pours a huge head with excellent retention and a nice cloudy ornage color.  Smell is of sour apple and citrus. The brett funk really comes through.  I was hoping for a nice funky beer, but there is an off bitterness from some dry tannins or yeast autolysis. and overtakes the funk of the brett. It just doesn't go well together. In addition there are a bit of clovey spicy undertones.  Crisp mouthfeel.  I wanted to like this beer after smelling it, but it just has an off bitterness and some tannins that make it less than desirable.

37,129,coldmeat23,4.53,"GLASS: Chimay Goblet TEMP: Cellared @ approx 45 degrees  Very nice, totally golden liquid with a slight orange tint. Two-finger head of dense white foam with excellent retention and amazing lacing.  Smell is spicey and yeasty. Fresh baked banana bread. Slight notes of white fruits. Honey and floral notes mingle with hints of citrus. Not at all bold, but delicious smelling, and inviting, nonetheless.  This is a different kind of trappist ale. All of the regular expected characteristics are there. Nice spicey flavors. Hints of banana and cloves. Honey sweetened yeast notes. Nice floral/citrus notes. Holding the whole thing together, though, is a funky sourness. Somewhat like a 'Flanders Belgian Ale'. Very interesting, and very good.  As any good belbian ale should be, this one is smooth and creamy with lots of tight, tiny little bubbles.  This is a highly drinkable brew, but I would keep it in mind as an 'alternate', not as my 'go to' for belgian ales. Extremely nice when you want something a little bit different.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,thespaceman,3.45,"Appearance: Nice golden brown in color, looks creamy by the body, facisinating 2 finger head, very soapy lacing.  Smell: A tad bit of banana bread, slight citrus flavor pops when the head starts to dissapate. Not too much to pick out but it's also got a slight roastiness to it.  Taste: This one is pretty interesting. A sour candy like flavor takes over the front of the beer, a bitter, hoppy finish. A tinge of apples creeps through as well. Fairly spicy throughout.  Mouthfeel: Very carbonated, I tipped my bottle in the bag on accident and I paid for it when I opened it. Light bodied yet keeps a good balance on the tongue, a little sour though.  Drinkability: Not very sessionable in the fact that it's a little too bitter and sour tasting. Not that it's a bad beer at all, but not something I would drink all night. Maybe the carbonation is too much? Either way, a good stab at the style. Definetley good for a pre-gamer to start the night. Steep price tag for this (almost 8.99) but it's something that I would maybe consider in the future.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Apples, lemons, peaches, and an additional balancing of light and tangy fruits. I cannot stress how complex the taste is, very nice. Coated pears in ginger or bananas sprinkled with cinnamon. A very interesting balance of fresh fruits with a faint, yet pronounced, spices. Finishes with a warm honey flavoring.  M: Medium body. Dry, crisp, and refreshing.

More sips- this beer is balanced. More bitter now as opposed to overly malty during the first sip. This is an incredibly complex beer. A bit of a bready yeastiness.

37,129,thekevlarkid,4.36,"Out of bottle dragged across the nation from Phoenix this beer was a cloudy orange color with an expansive three finger head of golden Labrador-colored foam. The retention was impressive as the head turned rocky after a while and the lacing was equally respectable. The aroma was complex, ripened fruit, slightly sour yeast, sweet malt and spices. The flavors were unique and challenging. At first it was malty and slightly sweet, then it went bluntly sour and tangy with wheat and yeast. Further developments included musty grain, citrus as it warmed and a long hoppy finish that stuck to my tongue. For a Belgian Pale Ale I found myself perplexed; was it a bad representation of the style or so advanced that I was flabbergasted? The mouthfeel was good, the carbonation a little on the fizzy side and the body medium.

Aroma of Belgian yeast, lots of light fruits, light sourness, slight hop bitterness, and spices. Wow, does this smell good! Flavor is equally as complex, perhaps even more so. Spices, Belgian yeast, dark, light and tropical fruits--but not as fruity as aroma-- rather malty, vegetables, lemon, and tartness. Closes with a bitter, dry finish. I love Belgian ales and this was a good one! Awesome. 9/4/9/4/17 (4.3/5)  Update 12/3/08: Tried some of the 9/7/08 batch. Aroma of lemon, sour fruits, and a slight hoppy bitterness. Ah, heaven.

A: Pours a deep amber color with 3 fingers of fluffy cloud like head. Great lacing.  S There is the bret right up front.A nice musty barnyard note. A little bit of pepper in the back. White pepper. Reminds me of a more subtle version of Avery 15.  T: Starts off with a sharp tart/citrus note. Really nice amount of funk in it. The pepper is there in the taste as well.  m: Has that nice dry wild ale mouthfeel. This beer finishes bone dry. Nice amount of carbonation.  D: I really enjoyed this beer. The price is a factor but it is not insanely overpriced so I will grab one every once in a while. The tartness and funk might bother some but I say the monks did not take it far enough.

Pours an orange-y brown, bright and cloudy. Big puffy white head that becomes creamier as it settles. Laces oddly, head slides around the sides of the glass along with the beer and doesn't stick to the glass at all. Weird. Smells tart, clove-like, withe notes of oranges, coriander. Flavor is similar to the aroma, though with a distinct malt base that's got a bit of caramel and the barest hint of chocolate. Small alcohol evident on the finish. Quite smooth, almost creamy, which is impressive considering the relatively low ABV. Drinks very well and interesting qualities.

It didn't completely vanish until I was over half way done drinking the beer. Slightly above average lacing.  S- Good, wholesome, feel-good smells here. Pine trees, a bouquet of flowers, herbs...not much hops though.  T- Wheat, lemon, more hops here than in the smell. Nice and crisp and refreshing, yet dry, not sweet.  M- Perfectlly balanced tastes, perfect carbonation, medium body. In my opinion, the after taste reminds me of the after taste you get from Chimay grand reserve.  D- This beer is surprisingly easy on the palate and stomach. Doesn't fill you up instantly...which is actually unlike most trappist style ales.

Sweet grain, a little spice, citrus rind, and a fruit tartness like something that has gone past its prime. Tart and dry in the finish. Hop bite is there, as is the alcohol.  This is moderately carbonated, which keeps these flavors in check enough for you to sip or slug. I gave this a drinkability rating much lower than taste.

Served from the unmistakably-shaped 33cl Orval bottle in a Chimay goblet at cellar temperature.  A - Very active and audible pour resulting in a dense, meringuey off white head about 1.5 inches high above the translucent rusty orange beer below. Head retention is unbelievable, and lacing is sticky and thick. Amazing.  S - Grainy sweet and sour maltiness. Apple cider vinegar. Green fermenting hay. Also a note of ""sterility"" that I can't put my finger on that reminds me of the smell of a doctor's office. Unqiue.  T - Malts are so pulled back that there is no initial hit of sweetness at all in the front. In the middle comes some citrusy tartness and a warming alcohol presence, followed by a yeastiness that pushes the alcohol back. Finish is medium dry with a crisp hoppiness and very long. Deep and full of character; much of which I can't pinpoint in the short time it takes me to do this review.  M - Lively and active in the mouth, puffing up to a round, cream of Belgiany goodness. Swallow is voluminous and large.  D - Much better than I remember it, and a pleasure to drink now that I ""understand"" it better. This is a trappist ale that is not to be missed, and a legend in its own right both in taste and presence.  Afterthought... Make sure to swirl in all the yeast you can coax off the bottom of the bottle. It adds to the depth of flavor and helps quell the alcohol a bit.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Then it's all about spices and wheat. Some phenols and lemon peel are also present. It leaves a very dry aftertaste that is ok.  M: Mid to high carbonation which is pretty standard for the genre.

The aroma varries from bottle to bottle with this one. Some time you get a funky brett forward farmhouse aroma and sometimes you get a big hop bomb over a belgian ale body. Either way you cant ask for more. I actually salivate just at the thought of smelling this brew.  The flavours are never quite the same with this one. You have a finely brewed hoppy Belgian Ale with the addition of brett. Depending on age you might not even notice the brett but with some age this really comes out and adds layers of complexity.  This is my favourite beer and if I could only drink one brew for the rest of my life it would be Orval.,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Cyberkedi,2.98,"Aroma is rich and mainly fruity, almost more like a cider or brandy than a beer, except there is a little maltiness. Color is a hazy honey golden with a very thick and persistent head. Flavor is malty and has a strong apple overtone, plus some bitterness that doesn't seem like hoppy bitterness and is a bit unpleasant. Texture is smooth and just a little on the thin side.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,spointon,4.65,"I poured this one from an 11.2oz bowling pin shaped brown bottle into a tulip pint glass. There was a bottling date listed of 1/30/2007.  A= This ale poured a rich dark orange color with just the slightest chill haze. The head was easily 3"" of snow white, rocky magnificence that very slowly dropped to a 1/4"" dense cap. Lots of sudsy, sticky lace down my glass.  S= I found aromas of malt sweetness, fruity esters, Belgian yeast, honey, and some mild lemon.  T= This is a subtle Belgian ale for sure. Initial flavors of light malt sweetness blend well with lemon grass, tart apples, and barnyarn yeastiness. There is a distinct flash of hops and then more light tartness kicks in and lasts through the drying finish.  MF= Medium bodied up front with a thinning finish that leaves you feeling like it was lighter than it really was. Nice effervescent carbonation cleansed my palate yet never became too sharp.  D= This ale somehow pulls off the neat trick of being very mild and subtle, yet deeply complex. So long as you can find it in relatively good condition, this is definitely a world class beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

S: Very complex definite belgian yeast strains, some lemon and orange citrus smells as well as some caramel malt smells too. This is somethin that is tricky to place. but very complex. bready, and a hint of hops in there too.  T: Spicy flavors appear first, this is peppery from the start. Then it gets a little more sour and tart. Really a work out for the tongue. Funky bubblegum aftertaste. Apples, peppers. Sour funk to it, not lambic like, but more belgian sour. This is really somethin.  M: thin, crisp, and refreshing, this is one fine beer. it's a little warming from the alcohol, but perfect. very nice.  D: this is a fine crafted beer, and it really should be enjoyed slowly, but i could drink a fair amount of this stuff, very easily. excellent beer. i can't believe i was hesitant on buying this.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,StrangeBrewer76,4.37,"A good beer all around. Many complexities in the smell and taste; lemon, banana, orange. The overall impression is balanced. Others who review this will get the intricacies more clearly but IMHO it tastes like a blend of a sour beer and a Belgian double or triple with additional hide-and-seek esters.  A must try for any BA.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Dissipates into a solid 1cm layer which floats on top and laces the glass with a bubbly finish. Smells strongly of aged yeast, lemon citrus and a sweet peach & banana notes as well. The yeast is at the forefront, dancing around on the tongue and leaving a tangy bitterness on the tongue, along with a subtle hop note. Lemon, tangerine & black pepper dance around behind the yeast. Crisp & refreshing on the palate with a dry, champagne-like finish. Extremely drinkable; goes down easy....along with Duval, what more could you want from a Belgian pale ale?",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,guild337,4.8,"I have wanted to try one for a long time, and was in the mood for a good trappist when I saw this bottle at my local grocery store (ok it's a slightly higher end grocery store).  A - What you would expect from a Trappist bottle aged ale. Deep golden color, and cloudy with sediment (mmm...sediment). A nice thick off white head.  S - Not overly fragrant, but what little there is, is fresh and clean. Smell is a little bit citrusey.  T- Taste, on the other hand, is quite complex and has a range of different flavors. My pallet is not the most acute, but I was able to enjoy some pear and apple flavors which were both subtle and poignant.  M - A nice light mouthfeel, with quite a bit of carbonation.  D - Very drinkable, and enjoyable ale. Right up there with my favorite Belgian beers.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Smell is fairly dry & herbal has a tarty sort of citrus smell to it.  Taste is very unique, starts out spicy and floral but the rest is sort of like a tart lemon, ends up being pretty dry, but not quite bitter. Not exactly sour but some really nice textures on this beer. I detect some banana flavor in there as well.  This medium bodied beer has a fair amount of carbonation, which I feel actually accentuates the tartness of the beer. This is a delicious brew, and I look forward to my next Orval.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,stageseven,3.16,"Appearance - Poured into a Chimay Goblet. The beer poured a light brown color, with a 1 finger off white head. The head stuck around and left good lacing on the glass. It was on the cloudy side, but we poured the sediment from the bottle into the glass to allow the yeast to dissipate through.  The aroma was also a bit unexpected. It was grassy, with an underlying spice scent. Sweetness and a scent of banana came through as well  The taste was fairly mild. There was a muted citrus fruit flavor that was slightly tangy, along with a light bitterness. The aftertaste had a slightly metallic tinge to it. Some banana flavor comes through as well.  The mouthfeel was thick and smooth, with a light carbonation. It was however a bit on the dry side.  This was a very easy beer to drink. Because the flavor was so mild, and there was no trace of alcohol in the taste, it was not at all difficult to throw back. I wouldn't say it was the best tasting beer ever, but certainly worth trying.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,ommegoose,4.83,"Purchased at Evanston First Liquors. Bottled on 4/24/2007, best before 4/24/2012.  Foams up incredibly fast and is a little difficult to pour. A mountain of foamy head develops and lasts and lasts. Pale gold with heavy carbonation to start, but turns into a nearly opaque murky brown when the sediment is added. Significant lacing.  The first thing that catches my nose is lemony tartness, followed by herbal and grassy notes. Like potpourri, or an herbal tea.  Full of lemon and herbal flavors. Maybe a hint of honey. Not very sweet at all. Finishes with a hint of spearmint. Hops are there with some bitterness, but they are pretty subdued at this point in the aging (about 18 months). I need some help picking out the flavors, but I know I like them very much. So unique and different with every sip. Amazing.  Dry. Very dry. Carbonation was not as bad as I expected from the pour. In fact, it's pretty smooth and slightly creamy.  I restrained myself because this is expensive and in relatively short supply, but I'd love to drink about four of these in a go. So dry, and that flavor keeps calling you back for sip after sip. A hyped beer, but lives up to it easily. I'm stunned that this is not a top 100 beer.

Pumpkin pie color with a light tan head that foams up to two fingers' height and manages to maintain itself at a solid half centimeter for most of the duration of the beer. Huge chunky lacing.  Tart bretty nose, almost like an unblended lambic but not as sour. Some distinct phenolic notes with a touch of golden apple and banana. Sort of somewhere between saison, geuze, and tripel. As it breathes it takes on a more sweet and floral character. Wonderful.  Flavor is lightly fruity with unripe pears. Lots of spices, white pepper, orange peel. Funky grassy brett influence. Dry bitter noble hop finish.  Body is a bit chalky (I poured the yeast in) and medium in viscosity. Highly carbonated but somehow it isn't distracting like in some Belgians.  Remarkable complexity, so multifarious that I'm afraid I can't fully describe/appreciate this beer. Phenomenal.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Citrus and tart, peppery phenol, hint of banana ester, expected pediococcus and brett horsiness are absent! White foamy head, coppery amber color, hazy.  Wonderful flavors of vanilla, tart and bitter like a citrus rind, very peppery and spicy, some cinnamon, hint of banana with some apple, fairly dry with little malt, finish is slightly metallic  The mouthful alternates between slightly prickly and creamy (the latter picks up when the vanilla and banana flavors peek thru), low to medium body, some mild puckering  Overall Impression, I found it to be a refreshing and interesting beer with an emphasis towards the bitter and tart side!",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Very effervescent with a moussey off-white head that settles after a minute into a thin layer. Aroma is a mix of faint flowery hops, toasted malt, bubblegum, coriander, allspice, and some earthy mustiness that reminds me of an underground stone cavern. Flavor is very much the same as aroma, but I must say that I changed my marks for this beer for higher numbers as it warmed up. As it reaches cellar temp more complex and subtle flavors peaked through and the malt profile while nearly absent at a colder temp evolved into something truly sublime in its personality. I look forward to someday sipping this beer on site at the abbey toasting to the good monks who have cradled this beer recipe for centuries.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Mouthfeel is dry and crisp. A little bit of a pucker in the finish. Good, but not he best Trappist I've had.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

S: A hint of lemon atop a very floral aroma. Very mild and fresh.  T: Smooth, slightly creamy head. Lemon rind notes. Again, a very floral and mildly malty taste followed by a straw/wheat notes and perhaps grass/mustiness to the hop bitterness. the hops are just enough to neutralize the sweetness. Dry and slightly tart finish.  M: Medium to full body for such a light and crisp beverage. Great head retention. Could be a bit more carbonation to add to the bite.  D: Could drink this over and over again. If this is the belgian concept of a session beer, I am moving.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Smell: I detected bread-like notes combined with medicinal herbs and lemon  Taste: I wish I could put into words how this tastes...dissect the different subtleties and so forth...but I can't. All I can say is very, very unique; truly unlike anything I've tried before. A VERY long, lingering aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: This stuff is really dry, so much so that it almost made me pucker a bit. Medium bodied  Drinkability: It went down very easily.  This is my first time tasting such a unique beer. I'm glad I finally got around to trying it after hearing it hyped up so much.

Nice, dark tan, with orange overtones. Head pours off-white and leaves crazy lacing. Ends up with a textured, multi-layered head after multiple pours.  S: Malty, yeasty, with lots of spices - cloves, sage, pepper, maybe even some ginger - apples, and dried apricots. A bit of soap and medicinal scent, as well.  T: Complex and brooding. The fruits and spices of the nose are still present, just dark. Sharp peppery zing upon hitting the palate; fades into some soapy flavors in the mid-regions before leaving an aftertaste reminiscent of peat, smoke, and spent charcoal briquettes.  M: Glides along the tongue. Smooth, yet coats the mouth ever so slightly. Medium-bodied, but very well developed. Super carbonated.  D: Pretty drinkable, despite its ridiculous character.

Its nearly like I tasted this then spat it. Really felt that dry to me. Plus its also like I added a tea spoon of salt. This beer gave me a sensation I haven't had in any other beer. Tangy mouthfeel although light & effervescent. I felt like a glass of water following a bottle (salty sensation) I will definately try this again cos its so different, & really is so easy to drink.

And man - this is an excellent beer! Smell is fantastic - spicy (sage? thyme?), a bit sour; black currants, apples, somekind of candy (bubblegum?), sweet malt. In the taste, the spices come forward even more, together with different fruits (currants, apples, some sweeter tropical ones too), grass and some sweet malt, plus a really nice, balanced bitterness, and a dry finish.

On the finish there's a bit of alcohol as well as a slight bretty tartness. Slighty bitter and has a bit of acid going on. This beer is more compex than I was ready for on the few occassions I've enjoyed it in the past. I'm glad I picked it up today to re-evaluate.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and highly carbonated.

37,129,ClavisAurea,4.83,"10/24/2015 Bottle served in an Orval glass at cellar temps. Bottle dated 03/2014  Appearance: deep amber-honey with a thick and billowy head that lasted to the last drop. Some haze from the Brett at bottling. The bottle let out a massive pop when I cracked the cap.  Smell: funky and complex, honey, some spicy hop character, classic Brett character but not over the top (yet)  Taste: bubbly and refreshing, lots of yeasty bitter flavor with the Brett shining through, very dry, massively carbonated, honey notes, bready but not cereal.  Wonderful Trappist ale. This is my second time having this beer. I would like to try it fresh to taste that dry hopping but I can't find bottles less than a year old already. Really looking forward to trying this beer at 2-5 years old when the Brett takes control of the flavor and nose. Delicious.  8/15/2016 Same bottling as above (2yrs, 5months old) Served cold in an Orval glass of course.  Still and always the King of Brett. This beer is now over the top infected with Brett Brux and I love it. This is the original and will always be the best for me. Crazy carbonation and a shit ton of barnyard character. The beer is so dry that it almost foams to nothing when it hits your mouth. I don't know if it can get too Bretty for me. I do still notice a faint ghost of hops past (thanks Matt for the phrase) but the Brett is the star to be sure. There is a crackery malt in there too. I get alcohol on the nose as it warms up.

If I closed my eyes and somebody asked what it was, I'd say immediately, ""Belgian Pale Ale"" - the type section of the style as far as aroma is concerned. After 10 or so sips, I'm detecting much more spiciness - coriander and pepper. T: Tart yeastiness, understated maltiness, I was expecting a little more up-front malt. Some hop bitterness.

S - Crisp apple and grassy hop notes dominate with some peppery tones in there as well.  T - Flavors of red apple, cider, and ripe pear come through the strongest, with a hint of hop bitterness coming through in the finish. There's a decent amount of breadiness from the yeast as well.  M - Full-bodied, yet fairly crisp due to the moderately high carbonation. Finishes smooth and dry with some tart fruit flavors lingering on the palate.

It fades around the edges of the tulip, leaving a chunk of head in the middle, until finally it's all gone, with a splattering of thick and thin residuals left behind. Aromatically this brew is quite unique and ultra-complex. A mixture of sour and sweet aromas are noticed initially. Malts, spice, yeasts, cloves, wheat, some fruitiness and a bit of welcomed funkiness make for a complex experience for the nose.  I haven't even tasted this brew yet, but the future looks quite bright. Tastes malty and fruity up front. It's good, drinkable and smooth. I'm getting an undercurrent of hops and some estery goodness mixed in to keep things moving along.  Mouth-feel is medium to full bodied. There's not a lot of carbonation, which works well in this setting, as the creamy smoothness goes unadulterated.

Wonderful aroma, some light Brett funk and lots of fruit esters namely sour apples with other indistinct fruits. Very complex, there is a certain harmony in the aroma so that no one portion is overwhelming. Taste is reminiscent of the aroma but with decidedly more Brett funk. This brew is a bit tart at first then becomes somewhat more malty. The funk really starts to come through towards the finish. Good mouthfeel, medium-ish body, meium-high carbonation and a somewhat dry finish. Drinkability is ok, I really don't know if I could have more than two of these. The flavors are really quite complex and unique but I think that if I had this too often of in too large a quantity I'd loose my fondness for it.

Orval carries a medicinal, musty grass and horse blanket scent due to the intense effect of the brettanomyces. Beneath this lies a light honey and herbal note.  The taste begins with a delightful interplay of bitter spices and sour brett. Things sweeten midway through as there is a growing aspect of fruit, such as pear and apple. Semi-dry clean finish with a slightly warming and enjoyable alcohol presence.  Mouthfeel is on the heavier side of medium, but the carbonation contributes to a light airy character.

Taste - At first very dry and somewhat bitter, the beer opens up and improves on warming. The palate is quite earthy, with other flavors I had trouble describing at first, but would call hay, apple, and pear. The finish is dry with grassy, herbal hop bitterness.

And to be fair to this beer I did not review it until I had tried at least 3 of them. This beer is the third.  The aroma fruity but somewhat one note. I like the smell, but it isn't something to write home about. I actually liked the aroma of just about any trappist ale I've tried better.  The taste is clean, tart, rustic, and refreshing all in the same mouthful. I have to say it is quit good. I enjoy this beer very much.  The mouthfeel is dry, tart, and refreshingly carbonated. The carbonation of this beer is definately felt in comparison to other trappist ales. I may have this beer at too low a temperature (50 Degrees Fahrenheit).  Drinkability is surprisingly easy. This is by far and away the most drinkable trappist ale I've had even if its not the best.

Then the flavors come through, lemon and an earthiness. Ends with mild hops.  Full in the mouth and very smooth.  One of the best.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,ALESwhatCURESya,4.53,"Bottled 20/06/2007:  I have had this beer many times before but never had a chance to review it. Bar none, one of my favorite Belgian beers. I am actually harvesting the Brett yeast dregs from this bottle to add to my current wild yeast culture. I will end up pitching it into a Fantome clone. The appearance of this pour is out of this world! I have never lacing like this before. A massive blanket of airy foam clings thickly to every inch of my Chimay chalice. A rusty copper body dances with carbonation. The aroma is spicy and is heavy with earthy, ""Wet cork"" overtones. The brett is definitely present as is the herbal dry hopping. The taste is slightly tart up front but spicy and sweet in the body. The slight acidity adds a sense of dryness to the finish. A nice hint of peppercorn makes a presence time and again. This may be a little too tart for those who do not appreciate a nice hint of Brettanomyces, but it is fantastic in my eyes. Truly a one-of-a-kind Trappist brew that has layers of uniqueness and satisfaction.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,adamette,3.46,"This is the 901st review of Orval on BA...I thought that was cool. I bought the bottle at McNaulty's Bier Markt in Cleveland, Ohio. That is a GREAT place for BAs. Bottle is dark yellow brown in the shape of a bowling pin, just like the one pictured above. Date bottled is 2 2 08.  A Poured into clean, clear glass. Body is cloudy, golden brown with a thick head that holds on for several minutes at least. Bubbles rise up from all surfaces of the glass in a very pleasing way. They are like single file lines of bubbles.  S Sweet, Citrusy, Malty, interesting.  T More of the same. Malty, citrusy, not as sweet tasting as the nose suggested. In fact, upon repeated swishing I find that this is actually some bitterness to it. I did not expect that as the other Belgians (and more specifically trappist Belgians) I found to maintain their sweetness.  M Interesting. Not as full as I expected it to be. It has an initial full, malty feel to it but what I wasn't expecting is that it sort of dissapears right down to an immediate aftertaste which is good but it does not have a mouthfeel like other trappists I have had. I do not think that it is bad, just not what I expected.  D The lower alcohol allows me to drink it more than some of the other trappists but it has that bitterness and it moves too quickly to the aftertaste.  Notes: I really struggled with this review. I was ready to be blown away by this beer since every other Belgian trappist totally blew me away. I do think that it is an exceptional beer but the quick shift to the aftertaste and the bitter taste were suprises. I can say that it is NOT my favorite trappist Belgian but it is a good beer. I do believe that I would like to try this again. I wonder if some of the qualities were due to some negative quality in the bottle that I got.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,tpd975,4.7,"A: Pours a nice cloudy murky orange hue with a nice tall rocky head. Great retention and chunky lace left behind.  S: Nice floral aroma with hints of citrus. Some acidic crushed sweet tarts and a bit of apple. Unique aroma.  T: Yum! Nice bold sparkling citrus flavor which yields to crushed cherry sweet tarts. Hints of bitter hops and some sweet apple and pear. Nice balance between malt and hops, bitter and sweet. Great Beer.  M: Light in body very sparkling. This one dances on the tongue.  D: Very, this one can be pounded or sipped, its one of my favorites.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,NHGrafx,4.75,"Poured from a 11.2oz brown bottle.  Pours a nice cloudy dark orange color with a big foamy head that lasts quite a while. There is some nice sediment on the bottom of the bottle too which takes some swirling to loosen up. It leaves nice foamy lacing on the glass as well.  Aroma is wonderfully complex. Mainly floral aromas with lemony and fruity smells, some yeast as well. Many others too that I can't really name, as they all blend together nicely.  The taste is excellent as well. Has some citrus flavors, can taste the malts in there too. Nice hoppiness on the finish. There are also some fruity flavors too, sort of like a combination of pears and apples. Other spices, too much too name. Very complex. Has excellent mouthfeel and very drinkable.  Overall this was a fantastic beer, another fine Trappist offering. Would definitely have this again.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,jkanavel,4.29,"This was a wonderful treat that I found in an unexpected place. It poured dark golden and hazy after I stirred the yeast a bit, with a nice fluffy off-white head.  The first thing I noticed was the smell that came bursting from the bottle when I opened it. I got a rush of ethanol which dissipated quickly and left behind strong banana notes.  The taste was a wonderful combination of sweetness offset by clean hops with alcoholic and yeasty back notes. Maybe some herbal/floral action going on too.  The mouthfeel is the kicker with this one, it is crisp and sharp, you almost get the impression you're drinking a citrus beverage. Its quite refreshing and enhances the flavor a great deal.  Pretty drinkable stuff I dare say, were it not so expensive that is.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,velkyal,3.73,"I fear I am about to commit beer heresy by admitting to not really enjoying this one all that much. The beer was bottled on the 31 May 2007 and as such was 14 months old when I drank it.  It poured a very nice copper colour, and was of course cloudy - as a personaly opinion this is a good thing, as I like beer unfiltered and unpastuerised. There was a fluffy head which dissipated slowly, and was gone within five minutes.  On the nose were distinctly citrus notes. The first taste was a shock to be honest. This will sound odd, but it tasted fizzy, rather tart and almost like popping candy on the tongue.  It wasn't awful, just not what I was expecting - so I will of course have another one to further hone my opinion.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,SirSketch,4.52,"I've heard so much about this beer I finally had to try it. Poured into a tulip glass. Mountain of cream colored, soapy textured head arises and sticks around for awhile. Murky golden copper color with shades of light red as well. Column of carbonation bubbles rise from the center. Very potent aroma! Smells of biscuity yeast, banana, citrus, rum-like alcohol. Very complex.  This is easily one of the top five beers I've ever had. Kind of acidic at first, then turns to a sweet and tangy taste that ends dry. The finish is so good. Phenols present, complex esters as well. So many other tastes I can't describe thoroughly. Bubbly in mouthfeel, medium in body. Simply pleasurable.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,SaucyA,4.58,"Bottled on 2/20/08  A - Poured into my wicked St Feuillien balloon/goblet/wine glass awesomeness. Looks truly killer. Orange/brown body with an ample, frothy, unreceding offwhite head. Just an absolutely remarkable looking beer.  S - Apples, slight brett funk, light fruits, belgian yeast. Light acidity.  T - This may very well be my favorite trappist offering yet. Westies are one thing, but when it comes to a BPA, this pup takes the cake. Slightly tart in the front, mineral notes in the middle, and a rather malty back end. Spice notes. Extremely complex for a rather ""light"" brew.  M - Medium body and rather huge carbonation, but the lasting head adds a bit of creaminess to the mix.  D - Fantastic drinkability. Just... fantastic.  Notes: I think this may have knocked Westies off the top of my ""Best Belgian Brew"" list. Plus, it's available in the USA to boot.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Ljunkan,4.73,"An all-time favourite.  Pours an hazy orange color with a large foamy head. Extremely nice head actually.  Smell is nice; sour/acid fruits, citrus and stable-like aromas.  Taste is even better; sour apples, grapefruit, citrus, some stable, slight notes of herbs. This beer has a interesting mix of sourness/acidness together with a dry hopped character and a very good bitterness.  Highly recommended!",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,itcomesnpints,3.26,"Light golden color with a massive head. Bouquet of different, glucose-free scents including: lemon peel, pepper and herbs. The taste follows the aroma and ends up producing a taste similar to Perrier mixed with tart lemons. Mouthfeel is very fizzy and the alcohol is well-hidden, yet the finish is desert arid. Orval is unlike anything I have ever tasted, but to be honest, it just was not enjoyable. It's possible that I may try it again someday, but only to experience its profound uniqueness. I am a relatively new beer connoisseur, so I may be changing this rating as my palate continues its education in the world of beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

S: Spice, clove, bubble gum all from the yeast.  T: Surprisigly clean on the front. The spiciness/ fruitiness doesn't really hit you until after the swallow.  M: Highly carbonated. This beer is almost alive when you drink it. Medium mouthfeel.  D: You could easily throw back a couple of these during a long session, but this one is meant to sip and enjoy. The complexity increases as it warms, so let it sit for a while in the glass. I probably should ahve let this one sit in the bottle for a while and get some age under it's belt, but it was too tempting.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Tangy fruits, hard cider, fragrance, some yeast but not as much as I expected. Quite acidic as well with a dry and sour finish. Light numbing on the tongue.

Bottled on date of: 20/02/2008 Good thing I checked because the first one I picked up was bottled in early 2007 and I wanted a fresher bottle.  Wow what a massive head! Easily three fingers worth of foam, the beer itself is dark golden and amber. The head takes forever to settle and leaves some thick lacing on the glass.  The aroma is darn good. Yeasty on the nose with tropical sour fruits like peaches, apricots, peaches, sour orange, and a bit of pineapple. Oh, some crisp green apples too. Some toasted malts and quite bready too. Spices and wild flowers open up as the beer settles. Pretty interesting aroma.  Tastes a little funky, like stale bread and bitter orange, apples and lemons in the back. The flavor is almost a shock, not nearly as close to the aroma. A lot more malt oriented than the sour fruits and spices you get on the nose. I also get an initial bitterness but it doesn't last too long. There are some apple and pears in the aftertaste. The subsequent sips have more fruit flavors; the apple and pear is pushed closer to the beginning and you get some orange and grapefruit rind, and also a little lemon. Stale bread and multi-grain bread holds near the end but the sour fruit cleans it up in the aftertaste. Again, very interesting.  Very good mouthfeel with some lively carbonation.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Hazy orange-golden colour with a nice white-off head.  Smells amazing with lots of hops and some dryness. I think the smell is mostly really nice hops, and some yeast tones.  The taste really lives up to the smell and it's full on hops,light sourness. You can really tell that this one is Dry-hopped.  Lovely beer, great that it's pretty easy to get to.

S - Fruity esters like apple, banana, and pineapple shine through first, with a mingled peppery phenol and musty yeast aroma.  T - Fruits pull through first, though less distinct than the nose. The bulk of the brew's taste rests on an overwhelming yeast component, marking its entrance with the most prominant musty/powdery taste I've ever experienced. A moderate sourness coupled with mild bitterness dominates late palate with a slight citric element. Finish is slightly bitter and lemon/orange.  M - Light bodied with huge carbonation.  D - I'm usually not too fond of these pale, phenolic, super-fizzy pale Belgians, but this is some great stuff.

Alcohols are perfume like. Soft malt aroma lingers in the background. As others have notes an incredibly complex and well balanced aroma.  T: Perfume like alcohol flavors trail seamlessly into horse blanket. Soft and only just sweet malt flavor is also noticeable. Leather and minerals and other earthy tastes. Very complex. Hop flavor is low but I think it adds to earthiness.  MF: Moderate mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. The beer is quite dry. Slight alcohol warmth.  D, notes: A great beer with a great history.

Despite having stopped at the monastery 2 years ago, despite having had it in many restaurants over the last few years, despite loving Matilda, etc. Well, here goes: Orval is possibly my least favorite of the Trappist beers, but it also has to be the most unique. The beer is copper colored and clear, maybe slightly hazed, with a thick dry-looking head. The smell is very complex, some grass, leather, barnyard funk, and hops (Belgian-style). The taste is everything from the aroma plus a little sour. The body is medium and the mouthfeel is a little thin, maybe due to a dry acidic after-taste.

37,129,CrellMoset,4.63,"Bottle from Wine Warehouse in Charlottesville, VA. Poured into a Watou chalice.  Appearance: A deep, slightly-hazed orange-bodied, ruddy amber beer. A good one-finger head rises and stays around for a great long time, considering the ""head-killing"" nature of the glass. Great sticky lacing. Sparse and fine, pinprick lacing rises slowly towards the surface.  Aroma: Hints of earthy yeast funk, simple candy sugar, tart citrus, and plenty of good, spicy hop notes.  Taste: Never what you expect from looking at it. Sure, there's a solid, grainy, earthy, bready backbone, lightly roasted with hints of caramel, as well as some lighter, sweeter, simpler candy sugar notes. But the real unique aspect of this beer is, obviously, the hops - tons of tart, dry lemon zest, apricot, and spicy, earthy, vegetal dry hop notes which follow you through to the finish. Earthy, spicy funk - definitely imparted by the Brett - close this one out. Truly unique.  Mouthfeel: Big bodied and fluffy, medium-sized bubbles that are consistently even, not thin, but not thick either - a few hints of hop oils make things nice and slick.  Drinkability: Wonderfully complex and unique, low in alcohol, not sweet or cloying - what's not to love about this historical beer?",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

The mouthfeel was amazing, kind of like having a icecream soda in your mouth, it fizzed and was creamy!

37,129,mgp80,4.69,"Really interesting beer, and challenging to rate, since comparing it to other Belgian pales is iffy. To my tastes its a meeting point somewhere between traditional abbey ales and a flanders red. I recommend it to any fan of either style.  Served out of a 12 oz bottle into an oversize wine glass. Pours dark and golden with a foamy head that shrinks fairly quickly into a foamy film. Aroma betrays the brett, with citrus, cranberry, ripe apple. Faint spice of the sort you'd expect from a trappist ale. Mild but nice. Flavor starts off with tart fruit, again cranberry comes to mind, followed by a rise of some peppery spice flavors with a little bit of a leathery taste. Tartness comes back in the aftertaste. High carbonation in the mouthfeel. This is very drinkable, as it strikes a balance between being interesting and going easy on the palate, and the alcohol is pretty well-hidden.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,glid02,4.18,"Got this from Green's in Atlanta.  Pours a cloudy copper color with a large (2-3 finger) frothy white head. The head sticks around for quite a while, very good retention, looks like a cloud. The head moves with the beer, doesn't hold onto the glass very well.  Smells a lot like a Tripel - a lot of fruit along with some sweet malt. There's not the tinge of alcohol though, probably because it's weaker than a normal Tripel.  Tastes great, fruity with a good bit of sweetness. Not quite crisp enough to be considered amazing.  The mouthfeel is pretty good. The carbonation is a bit intense, and otherwise it feels a little too thin.  This is a pretty drinkable beer. There's nothing that makes it hard to drink it, but there's also nothing that makes it outstanding.  I would recommend this beer, just because it's an interesting melding of a Tripel and a Blonde. There are characteristics of both in this beer, and it's certainly worth trying.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,kevinglin,4.45,"Poured into a Belgian-style goblet; orange-copper with an off-white head that filled nearly half the glass. What a unique aroma! I'm not even sure how to describe it - fruity, floral, malty, damp - quite different than other beers I've had. I know there is Brett in this brew, my first, so perhaps I'm trying to figure out what that bug causes in the drink.  Taste is great. Again, very unique to my palate as I have not had a lot of Belgian beers. A sour, puckering in the swallow and a slight hint of alcohol warmth wrapped up in malty, fruity overtones. I've let the brew warm a bit here and the aroma and flavor are really shining through now. Mouthfeel is medium, with a finish more dry than sweet.  Overall, I'll look for this again for sure. A very pleasing brew that I really enjoyed.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,boston2bburg,4.15,"Bottled on 24/06/2005, enjoyed on 30/07/2008. Two fingers of foamy white head cover a hazy, pale amber body in my snifter. The head retention is remarkable, settling at 1/4"" and leaving a layer of lacing like snow coating frost on a window as the liquid below disappears.  The first whiff is mainly of sweet banana, with some residual clove as well. The banana is almost exclusive as the beer warms and is very rich, like banana pudding.  There is more clove than banana to the taste, although both are still present. The initial sour acidity yields to a sweeter bubbly foam as I roll it over my tongue. There's plenty of carbonation and a spiciness from the hops which is more prevalent at lower temperatures.  The quality of this beer is evident across the board, although I'd prefer the banana carry over more to the flavor to override the sourness of the yeast.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,MrHungryMonkey,4.47,"Good sweet-smelling malt with ample zesty, wildly medicinal yeast odors. So wild!  Buttery apricot color, too translucent to be clear. A great head quickly shrunk down to a mild head and stayed mild on through.  Incredibly tart, lemon grass / lemon rind. Powerful, dry, powdery, medicinal, mineral, dull yeastiness that seems to contribute more to feel than taste. Of the naturally pleasant flavors the most prominent to my palate are sundry exotic fruit flavors like mango and perhaps kiwi. It really feels like it has both a light and medium-thick body simultaneously. I guess the yeasty dullness makes the mouthfeel feel flat and slipper, less viscous than water, but then the retained malt body works with the carbonation to thicken it back up. It's quite a tactile experience.  This is definitely a strange brew to my American Micro palate. I couldn't have said it tasted good when I started, but it really grew on me. Regardless, is for sure worth the cost and the anguish just to live in a world of sensory confusion for a while.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,pinotboy007,4.21,"Purchased at Wegmans grocer in Sterling, VA.  A - Beautiful raw honey/burnt orange color with no visibile carbonation. Sports a whipped, rocky head that slowly settles; modest lacing and some floaties.  S - Light citrus, malt.  T/M - Uniquely dry tasting with nice citrus overtones, dry biscuit, maybe even a touch of clove and some hops. Light and a bit creamy. Challenges the palate, but delicious!  D - Probably too drinkable but would complement food nicely, especially pork tenderloin.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Greggy,4.15,"A- Pours a nice rocky fluffy head into a la fin du monde glass. The body is a nice slightly cloudy copper color with not to much sediment. After the head recedes a nice clinging lace remains.  S- Right off the bat I get a large hoppy grasiness, along with some big pepper, and a mineral inspired floral note. I detect a light bit of phenols as well. Nice.  T- On the palette this beer has an almost medicinal taste to start reminiscent of cough syrup with almost the same mentholated finish on the back of the throat. I would even say I taste suggestions of a very dry cider. The same light faint mineral finish is a bit dry leaving the palette coated with almost a graphite note. Unique to say the least.  M- mouthfeel is medium which is nice with the style, and the odd notes coating the palate on the tail end is pretty unique.  D- 6.9% makes this a belgian I can partake in without getting overly tipsy. As odd as this beer was for me, I look forward to pairing it with some food.

Smells lightly of yeast, clovey, and banana. Fairly interesting for a belgian pale ale, has a lemony/citrusy, slightly minerally, hop bitterness accompanying the fruityness and lightly bready malt..  Edit: Had to lower the taste score on this because after it warmed a bit it had an overpowering and offensive resemblance to nail polish remover; prominent in the smell as well",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,deg,4.18,"The beer went into the bottle with a rich, thick head that would not dissipate while I drank it. The color was like honey.

I poured mine into a beautiful Orval goblet I purchased at the monastary  A: Orange with a huge meringue head. Some sediment in the bottom. Darker than most and considerably cloudy.  N: Spices and dark fruits. Smell is very good, the floral elements break through like wildfire when the foam head drops off.  T: Hate when people simply list a beer as balanced but this one is well, balanced. Here are the hops when it is warmed down and the floral elements are tasty. The spices tie this one in a nice tight package. Warming alcohol.  M: Substantially spicy on the tongue and chewy. Considerable carbonation but incredibly smooth. Unique for the trappist styles. Absolutely love the chewiness.  D: Much like the other trappist beers, delicious. This one is even more drinkable given the strength and would love to sit down with several of these several nights a week.  A must try.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Slight hints of apple and citrus in aroma, though very faint.Some taste of apple, but more apple juice than cider, and also dry champagne with a bit of a spicey, tart finish.

Very nice coating lace.  Nose has a nice presentation of belgian style, with a sour funk over fainter grains in the back with a notable crisp green grape fruit balance.  Taste sits lightly on the palate at first, then increasing in sour and bitter character to the finish. Overall flavor is somewhat light, with mild grains and slight spicy notes in the middle, washing out, then finishing with an acidic bitterness and very faint alcohol fume. Leaves a bitter/sour flavor on the lips.  Lighter medium bodied, with full soft carbonation. Rather dry finish.  Acidic bitterness is making this one somewhat hard to love.

The aroma was not over powering but smelled of spice, citrus and hops. Hints of a floral aroma came in too.  The first sip brought a sharp shot of an orange/citrus flavor. As the tasting progressed it grew in complexity bring out many of the flavors that a good beer does. The tinges of hops and malts played very well with this beer's tanginess.

37,129,pweis909,4.82,"Edit: Suggestion. Try a few beers bottled on different dates. A more recent bottle (dated Dec 27, 2007) seems even more lively and bright to me.  Deep gold, just a shade short of amber, with big white head of tight bubbles. Most of the head dissipated after a few sips, but the carbonation is persistent, leaving a quarter inch foam and lacey rings around the glass. Edit: The more recent bottle seems more amber to me.  The aroma is phenolic, with a bit of medicinal notes, and maybe a bit of clove. These flavors mesh with hop spiciness, making it tough to separate them all. Edit: There is much more fruit to the nose in the more recent bottle, maybe a bit of bubble gum, that compliments the clove. The medicinal notes are subdued.  The beer is lively on the tongue, and gives a bit of carbonation bitterness, but as I swirl the beer in the mouth, there is the barest touch of malt sweetness followed by a very dry finish with a slightly resiny hop character. Edit: the newer beer has a stronger sweetness.  The beer is ""digestible"", with a light body characteristic of trappist beers. The alcohol helps contribute to the dry light feel. Very drinkable.

Fantastic carbonation. Excellent retention. Possibly the prettiest beer I've ever seen.  S: Mildly fruity with hints of orange, mildly floral with a little bit of rose, mildly spicy with a hint of pepper, clove, mildly funky with a little bit of a leathery note. Complex.

D: Very drinkable. I need to get more of this  **Edit 13 Oct 2013** Bottled 20 Feb 2008, this bottle is now 5 years and 8 months old. The nose is dominated by the Brett characteristics. A blend of clove, pepper, a touch of damp hay, fennel, this is one complex beast. The palate is similarly Bretty, earthy, spicy and complex, but with a touch of honey sweetness as well. Crisp and highly carbonated, a touch of acidity (clove like bitterness, carbonic acid) is present. A touch dull due to age, the delicate brightness of the citrusy hops that fresher bottles have is missing. Still, this is really good. 4.25/4/4.25  **Edit 05 Apr 2014** Bottled 15 Jul 2003. Thank you, Peter.  Wonderfully funky with a blend of melon, earth, fruit and fennel, this smells great! Some citrus, almost a whiff of cola, there isn't much clove present.

37,129,kkipple,3.66,"Pondering independence, I crack out one of these brews to fill my recently acquired Orval chalice. The goblet is a beaut, and it's been months since I've had one of these... maybe longer. Into the fish-adorned goblet it goes!  ... and produces a head so staggering, so wonderful, that it takes me aback. Orval creates a thick, rich meringue-like froth that piles up up up! atop the beer. It foams up, then begins to settle, crackling with annoyance as it subsides. Falling from the edges first, it leaves gobs of sea-foam lace and a mound of thick, dense bubbles. If I were a bit smaller, I believe I could walk across the surface of said head... but enough. The Orval itself is hazy, and a burnt, watery orange. The everlasting head still sits commandingly as I raise the glass for a sniff.  Mmm, yeasty... pungent is the word here. This beer brims over with estery yeast character, sour and fruity, dry and rosy. It's simple, yet hard to define. There is a sweetness about the nose that is certainly not found in the mouth. Whatever this smells like, it's pretty memorable.  The flavor is something of a letdown after such high previous marks. This is a tart, very dry Belgian ale. There's a bitter hop note but it's lost amidst the swirl of yeast and sour flavor... hints of lemons, pale malt, light caramel and pear are all here. It comes together nicely but is simply too attenuated for easy drinking. Orval sports very fine, light carbonation and leaves my mouth feeling quite dry. Interesting and unique to be sure, but not really my thing... I do wonder what the original malt bill for this beer was.  Mouthfeel is thin, with light carbonation (see above) and finishes sour, tart and grainy. Clean in its own way, while a touch of malt sweetness teases the palate after you swallow.  To sum: Orval is decently drinkable, if you like it. This is quite a sophisticated and erudite beer and reminiscent of a dry white wine or champagne. Not a good intro to Belgian beers, but it certainly fills a niche. Try Orval at least once.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Smells mildly fruity, yeasty, very pleasant without being overpowering.  The taste has notes of citrus, a little spice, some very nice malt complexity and a fairly strong, somewhat suprising alcoholic presence at the end, given the relatively (for Trappists) low 6.9% ABV.

A: Slightly hazy, copper, dark amber color with thick 2-finger head in my St. Bernardus chalice. A half centimeter head remained through the whole beer while I sipped on it over 40 minutes or so, leaving a sticky lace.  S: Grapes, funk, sweet malt, some grass and hay aromas, the ""wet blanket"" that everyone talks about.  T: This is a very complex beer, so my attempt at describing will fall short for sure. Starts out prickly on the tongue with some subtleness, followed by a burst of sweet, sour, funk, grass, and grapes. The bitterness moves in at the end, and sustains in the corners of my mouth for several minutes. This is one to sip, savor, sit back, and enjoy.

37,129,MusicaleMike,4.45,"I poured this 11.2 oz. bottle into my patented Orval glass. Bottled on 25/09/2007 and best before 25/09/2012. I am impressed that this brew could last that long. I wonder if it would need to be stored in a fridge or just in a cool cellar? The strength doesn't seem high enough to ""age"" for that long. This is the first Trappist ale I have reviewed.  A: It pours a beautiful, clear amber color. There is a thick, off-white head which sits about a finger and a half deep. There is lots of carbonation in this brew. The head tried to cling to the side of the glass at first, but ultimately failed.  S: It gives off the classic Belgian beer aroma. Not much hop aroma, though it is faintly present. There are some very fruity esters in the smell...I say banana and peach are two smells I get out of this one.  T: I am surprised by the taste. I was expecting something more sweet. Really, there is alcohol up front, and the fruity esters make you think that the beer will be sweet, but I guess the attenuation rate is very high in this beer. There is a peppery aspect to this beer, which I assume comes from the yeast and/or malt. Very low hop flavor in the aftertaste. When held in the mouth, there is some sweetness present, with fruit esters (banana/clove).  M: Smooth, light bodied and I think a little dry. The carbonation is not fizzy, just very smooth.  D: This is a great beer to have a few of in the course of a night. The drinkability factor is high for this one. It would be fun to have a few with a monk or two.

I had hesitated to drink this beer for some reason.... thinking it would be syrupy, or overwhelming. I don't quite know why I had this impression, because this beer is excellently aged.  Strong flavors of apple, light honey, and citrus, as well as ginger, paired with a high level of carbonation and a nice hop finish make this beer very complex... very tart, a perfect pair for a nice salad with some seared spicy pork on top... or any spicy food. The tartness and light sweetness of the beer lifts the hot flavors off the tongue... replacing them with a nice alcohol-inspired warmth and lingering sweet spiciness.

Lovely lacing sticks to the glass and the head retention is remarkable.  Taste: The tartness first noticed in the nose comes out fairly delicately in the taste. Not a strong tart, but rather a mild bite that sticks on the tongue well into the aftertaste. Hops come out a lot moreso than in any other trappist ale, and it leaves you thirsting for more.  Feel: A little bit of a grainy feel. Medium-bodied with carbonation that sticks around for a while.. pretty smooth overall  Drinkability: Very drinkable, and with a fairly moderate ABV, its not too much to handle. Another nice trappist beer",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Douglas14,4.68,"Pours out an awesome hazy, pale orange color with an incredible, fluffy, dense head that leaves a layer of lace on the glass and stays intact the whole way down. The smell is heavily of smoky light wood, lightly roasted malt and possibly some banana. Fruit, spices and malt overwhelm the palate, in a good way. Slight hops are very noticeable towards the end, and your mouth is left very dry. As for mouthfeel, the heavy carbonation gives it a nice, light quality that plays with the senses (b/c of how complex it really is). Awesome beer. For some reason I had avoided this beer and I don't know why (I'm guessing because of its easy popularity and my prejudgments against it). I am glad I finally decided to try it.

Fruity nose, yeasty esters, just as it should. Apple and lime in the nose.  Tartness with offsetting sweetness, just nicely balanced, the malt character is subtle, very easy to enjoy.

A little piney with a phenolic aftertaste.  The mouthfeel is very light, and almost reminiscent of a hefeweizen.

Smell was fruity with a Belgian yeasty aroma. Not chalky smelling. Seven-Up!. Earthy. Floral. Woody. Wild, Lambic-like funkiness (in a very good way).  Taste was tangy and fruity. Complex. Bitterness and sweetness. Peppery. Yeast breadiness. There was a long, subtle finish of hops flavors and graininess. Baked fruits. Alcohol peaked as it warmed, but it was never too strong. Pretty dry.  Mouthfeel was medium to full with medium to mild carbonation.  This one had aged longer than I prefer.

After learning about Belgium beers I was told that this was a must try and I found out why. Although this not my favorite of the Belgium's I have tasted it certainly is a remarkable beer.

Massive billowy off-white head like a root beer float, more little bubbles than big bubbles.  S - Magnificent. Sour cherry burst. Later mellows, a bit like some fruit jam/preserves wafting from hot toast.  T - Interesting mix of bittersweet/sour and mild funk. Hoping for a bit of that cherry even though it isn't the intended flavor, not finding it. Something fruity though, like a red apple.  M/D - Classic bitey front of tongue kick I find with most trappist beers, abbeys, tripels, etc. Nothing too puckery after a few sips, really mellows out. Incredibly easy to drink.  Worth the hype, but a bit on the mild (if drinkable) side. Lots of flavor things going on that I'm still chasing. Consistency of flavor is notable, doesn't change too much from the cold pour to being warm over a period of time. Wonderful aromatics. Not the prettiest beer I've ever seen (not by a mile), but complex and worthy of repeat visits.  Update: 2nd tasting, and I've been drinking a lot more Belgians lately.

Poured a honey-copper color, with a big two-finger (I have thick fingers), off-white head. Said head took a while to drop, leaving thin sheets of lace in my St. Bernardus goblet.  The nose is of fruit, candy sweetness and cloves, with a tiny hop touch providing a scent of new-mown hay.  A bit more bitter and spicy in the taste than in the smell. Tart, sour apples compete with cloves and pepper, with a touch of herbal bitterness and dryness at the swallow.  Light-bodied, with a mouthfeel that was prickly, effervescent and slightly oily.  A tasty Belgian pale ale that would probably taste even better were it a hot day. I could see it being quite refreshing on such a day. It's not half-bad on a cool, blustery afternoon, either.

Beautiful orangey blonde beer with saison-like carbonation and a royal looking head of slightly off-white foam.  The smell is amazing on this glass. Light fruity notes and a touch of candy sweetness. Very mild hop character peaking through the fruit.  All of the fruit from the nose is there in flavor but in spirit only. I can't identify a specific flavor but they all are muted as the hop character of the orval and slight yeasty taste (it was decanted perfectly so this was not the result of a bad pour or agitated bottle). I taste bits of fresh cut grass and hay, almost as if this was a trappist saison.  The mouthfeel is light, bright, and refreshing.

Some sweetness is on the end but it is light (honey and maybe some caramel).  T - More sour apple in the flavor. The spice that is present in the flavor is much sharper than the aroma lets on. Almost peppery in taste. Caramel and sugars show midway. Alcohol and more sour fruit round things out. There is a slight hint of metallic flavor throughout but it is very, very hard to pick out  M - Medium bodied with excellent carbonation.

37,129,Georgiabeer,4.38,"For my 800th review I thought I'd review a beer from the one Trappist brewery I'd somehow missed reviewing before. I've had this brew many times, and I've found that it is extremely changeable over time- the older it is the more Brett comes out and the funkier and more sour it is and more Saison-like. The younger it is the spicier and cleaner and hoppier it is- but still with Saison elements. I like it both ways and at every point inbetween, but the bottle I'm reviewing is of the younger variety.  It pours a hazy golden with a fine white head that sticks around and leaves some spotty lacing. The aroma is slightly sour, a bit grassy and herbal, and has a touch of lemon and pepper in it as well. The taste is a complex mixture of light lemon, herbal hops, black and white pepper, and a dry, light astringency. Very nice. Smooth and slightly peppery mouthfeel make this a delight to drink on this hot day on my back porch. If it were a bit older and more sour, I'd probably edge the flavor score up to a five. Any way you find it, its worth drinking.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,jeonseh,4.31,"Had this in a GI Reserve Glass and from a bottle. Thanks to Unholy 2 for throwing this in as an extra on a trade.  A - A very nice looking beer as I would call it a light amber color. It has traces of orange and lemon throughout of it. A bit hazy as only a trace of light gets through and can see a ton of carbonation trailing up through it. A nice creamy, one finger head sits on top and is rather strong there.  S - smells lemony fresh mixed in with a bready, yeasty odor. There is also a lint hint of pepper as well.  T - Now, here is where this beer is rather unique. First, it has a hint of orange and lemon that come on first. After that, there is that legendary Orval funkiness which reminds me a bit of the taste of blue cheese. Also has an earthen almost grassy taste and also get a hint of the yeasty, bread flavors as well. There is also a hint of sweet malt that comes on first before the funk comes through and gives the beer a bit of a sweet flavor. Have to say that the aftertaste does a good job of reflecting the beer's flavors as I get a mixture of lemon spiciness and funk just hanging out.  MF - A full mouth feel as this is one bready beer that just hangs out. Plus have to say that this one has a ton of carbonation but somehow manages to make it not overpowering at all, which is sometimes a problem with this style in my opinion.  D - Overall, a very tasty and complex beer that has a surprising note to it with its funk. This would be a beer that I would bust out with a cheese platter whenever I'm not in a mood for a Belgian Dark Ale. I would definitely reach for one of these again and really for the uniqueness that I haven't found in many other beers that I have had before.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Fine notes of citrus, spice, tartness, all inside of a big crisp taste. Nice dry finish which faded evenly.  Mouthfeel. Round, velvet, good carbonation.

Even from about two feet away I pick up a big hoppy pear and lemon aroma.  Orval has such an American hop character for me. Resiny bitterness takes over almost immediately, pine certainly, but much more complex than that, I can't do it justice. I get alot of pear off of this beer along with sour apples.

Taste is surprisingly light, a little sour at first, a little bready in the middle, and a nice hop bitterness to balance out the end. A fruity and very dry white wine flavor lasts in the finish.  Mouthfeel is outstanding, super carbonated and light to add to the sharp flavors.  Drinkability is very good, this a hugely easy to drink and refreshing brew.  Overall, impressive.

Sweet stone fruit, mandarin, grapefruit, honey, sweet malt. Lots of yeast character to achieve this fruitiness.  Taste - 4.5 What a weird beer! It is more sour than bitter, very yeasty, fruity sweet and dry in the finish. Sweetness is not immediately apparent, flavours of bitter apricot, grapefruit, lemon-like sourness and hoppy bitterness in the very dry finish. All in all, masses of flavour, maybe a little too much for me!  Mouthfeel - 4.0 Slightly rough, more carbonated than expected for the style. Moderate to heavy weight in the mouth, carbonation has a sharp bite to it.  Drinkability - 4.0 Despite the relatively moderate 6.2%ABV, I would rarely want a second of these in a sitting. However, I will definitely be drinking this again, because the ""wow"" factor is surely there.  OVERALL - 4.35 Part of me feels that I should have scored this higher as I reminisce of the powerful flavours. However, I feel this is a beer that needs food to be really drinkable, as the power and complexity are simply staggering for the tastebuds. Not a beer for the newly initiated, or for drinking quickly, but I know I will be coming back for another taste.

Lacing is dense and divine, clawing at the sides of the glass waiting to explode with flavour - or something similarly anthropomorphic.  Nose is excellent, lots of fruity malt with a hint of peppery spice. Very complex but could be stronger, it's necessary to burrow your nose right into the glass to get the full effect. Not to take anything away from it though - it could be called subtle, and it really is an excellent aromatic beer.  Taste is next to Godliness with a rich complex palate of malty cinnamon-spiced apple characters with a long finish of burgeoning hop flavours. It's not really a bitter finish, just a robust hop flavour that makes you look back on the long, winding journey of deliciousness you were just taken on and smile.

A very interesting tasting brew with some a nice bit of sweetness and a lot of fruitiness. Apricots are the main fruit taste for me, and a little bit of malted sweetness.

One of the finest yeast forward styles ever. The balance is divine with each flavor riding a strong wave to make maximum impact. The finish is of bitter herbals and spices. Dry and airy wheat and spring water in the end, fresh and strong flavor's...mostly enjoying the complex, weird and wild yeast strain!  The feel is classic, crisp ultra-clean but creamy, refreshing and smooth...very light overall. Champagne-like lightness but much smoother going down. finishes dry but refreshing. amazing feel.  A true, Belgian Trappist classic. One of the very best in style and overall.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,ATPete,4.03,"i love those ATP's  Pours a pale orange yellow color with a big rocky off white head sporting enormous swiss cheese like holes. Nice belgian yeasty aroma, some hops, some malts, some lemon, very nice. My tongue loves Orval, bone dry, with hints of a green tea like bitterness upon the finish, and rather good hop/malt balance. It is definitely the strangest trappist bier i have encountered. Extremely effervescent, and very refreshing makes the Orval very drinkable.  This review is from a bottle with an 8/08/07 bottling date  They also say that Orval has been rumored to have some certain medicinal qualities? Can anyone confirm or deny this?",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,dnichols,3.96,"My BA buddy rdunham shared a couple of bottles with me. The 330 ml capped bottle was poured into a stemless wine glass.  A: I poured a hazy washed out orange body with a robust white head of about two fingers and dense lacing.  S: It smelled most directly of creamy lightly tasted malts and bready white yeast with a large splash of orange and spices. There was also a touch of grassy aroma that seemed out of place.  T: It began with a blast of creamy and smooth sweet malts with a zing of spices and carbonation that was peppery and refreshing. There were light undertones of sweet oranges. It finished clean and warm with little aftertaste.  M: It was medium to full bodied with lots of carbonation. It finished clean and warm with little aftertaste.  D: It is a bit full bodied and has a high ABV making this brew a poor candidate for a session beer.

Very floral smell, with hints of flowery pot purre, and citrus fruits, lemon and bitter orange.  Quite a crisp beer, with citrus and floral notes, much like a typical Pale Ale. Lemon rind and bitterness from the hops rounds this out quite well. Hints of fermented apple in the finish, with incredible dryness.  Incredibly complex through the different yeasts they use, this is one to sit down and really think about. Fantastic beer that is truley amazing.

Buried beneath the bubbles the beer looked an opaque golden amber color with very little if any carbonation. Unique sort of lemon citrus smell to it at first, later on detected a flowery sweetness and a grassy spice. Tasted a mild grape and apple sweetness with a little citrus bitterness and finished very crisp and clean.

Aroma of orange peel, leather and grass. As I neared the bottom of the chalice, (bummer), I could smell the alcohol as I rolled the goblet around at an angle.  Tasted of bread and wild orange blossom honey. A very pleasing level of hoppiness, with just a touch of bitterness at the beginning and sweetness at the end.

With the smell, there was some malt, yeast and fruit. Subtle.  Here's where it's interesting. While you get a dose of yeast, apples and malt, there is an off-putting bitterness about this one. I'm guessing this is caused by the hops. It's not a bad taste, but it's this one component that doesn't serve it well.  The mouthfeel is solid, with the typically Belgian high carbonation rate. As I said, the finish is dry, but too bitter.  Overall, this is kind of a mixed bag. It's strong in many categories, but the bitterness of the taste throws it off kilter. Nonetheless, it's still fairly drinkable.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

There is a sugary sweet, candy scent in there as well. The taste was very mild, I was expecting this robust, sweet flavor, but it doesn't even seem to leave any flavor on the palate. It does finsh with a strong hop bitterness, though nothing to harsh. The feel is almost like a lager, surprisingly crisp, and very dry finish from beginning to end. I am fairly let down by the taste, everything else was a surprise in this my first trappist ale.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

It's one of the few foreign craft beers Iceland imports.  Dig it:  A: opaque but not too cloudy, golden with an orange tint, bubbly, white, two-finger head, so-so retention, ZERO lace S: winey grape notes, peach (?), alcohol T: bitter at first, with a crisp, clean-as-a-whistle finish.

37,129,yourefragile,4.18,"Oval shaped 11.2 oz brown bottle with bottled on date of 8/8/2007 poured into a Chimay chalice  A: Murky golden orange/amber color. Massive, dense slightly off white head that hangs around forever with some splotchy lacing. S: Very strong, hit me as soon as I opened the bottle. Complex, but no one aroma really jumps out. Orange, lemon, yeast, citrus rind, coriander, slight pepper. Very well balanced, definitely more floral and spicy than sweet. T: Lighter side of medium bodied, very highly carbonated resulting in a very smooth, creamy taste that is deceptively thicker than the actual body is. Very interesting combination of the sweeter malty flavors, spicy floral like flavors and the citrus rind flavor. The predominant flavor pulls toward the earthy, citrus rind taste, with the sweeter/tarty flavors in the beginning being subdued throughout. The finish is very dry, grainy, earthy and lingers forever.  This is an amazingly complex, balanced beer, but personally I would enjoy this a little more if leaned closer to the tart or sweeter side than the earthy, citrus rind.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

I haven't reviewed all of them yet though, and this is bringing me one step closer to that goal. Thanks to the LCBO for bringing this one back in Spring Release '08.  6.90% abv, 330mL bottle. Bottled on 09/25/2007, so about five and half months old. Poured into a white wine glass first then my Chimay chalice. This was at cellar temp then got a while in the fridge.  Monster head on this one when I poured it! Big and foamy, amber-y off white, very natural looking. Almost clear effervescent amber body. Not much lace.  Nose has lots of oranginess, tangerine, rind, some lighter floral hop character. Super complex. Spice, of course. Bit of booziness too, tied in with pale malt. Earthy, farmy, got some dirt and hay at the forefront. Cane sugar, vanilla. Caramel, some sour cherriness. A little acetic quality to it - tied to green apple? Very winey, but in a good way. Some subtle mineral aromas, like hard water. The pour in the chalice got more yeasty, but not excessively so.  Feel is very light with substantial spritzy carbonation. I'm already getting some crazy palate stuff here just holding it in my mouth and breathing. Now I remember you, Orval. Gets sharp in the mouth right away. Lollipops, pungent pale malt, apple vinegar again(?), dirt, refined sugar, blue cheese, finish is dry and vegetal, super long, with a big snap of bitterness - sort of resinous but less clean. Cidery, with some yeast to muddle it up. Sahara dry with some physical mouth drying too, winey again. A hint of metal. Citrus fades away compared to the nose. Very earthy, the finish seems gone but little flavours will pop back up on your palate. Just got some sour mix, lime candy. Highly drinkable.  This is something else. One of a kind brew, bravo.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,edskirk3,4.95,"I always hate when I have (what I consider to be) a ""special"" beer in my fridge, one which I feel must be saved for a special occasion. Orval is that beer in the fridge today. It is ""special"" because I've never had it before, however I do have an Orval chalice which I've used many times. I figure Leap Day Eve is as special an occasion as any, so here we are.  I have a single, 11.2 oz brown bottle that looks like it might contain a genie. It has the Authentic Trappist Product seal, as well as a bottling date of 07.05.07 which makes this sample just under 8 months old. I have also allowed it to warm up a bit before opening.  As I've always imagined, Orval looks perfect when poured into its special glass. It sits cloudy amber orange with a very dense, creamy head which creeps up the circumference of the vessel.  The smell is magnificent. And pungent all the way till the end. Like a delicious flower that I'm not allergic to. And that flower has been spritzed with lemon and something peppery and pinelike. My first thought was mint but that's not it. Also banana.  The first thing I noticed when tasting is how light-bodied this ale is. Way more watery than I had expected. Very surprising. That said, I'm amazed how complex the flavors are here. Definite farmhouse character, with flavors of hay and such. Citrus rind. Slight tartness. Very slightly medicinal. And extremely dry altogether.  I have had this sitting around since Christmas. It was worth the wait. I wonder how it would have tasted then. I don't think I've ever sniffed a beer so many times, and pondered so much after each sip. Quite an enlightening, thought provoking ale and a definite world class brew.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Smell: Complex aroma filled with notes of citrus, pears, apple cores, gentian, sauvignon blanc, and a second-hand horseblanket store.  Taste: Flavors of unripened pears, piced citrus, and bitter herbs. Dash of white wine. Sour and funky throughout. Hops come through now and again amongst all the various tastes. Finishes peppery and exceedingly dry. Lingering tongue-numbing sourness in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Spritzy, lightly prickly carbonation.

Smell: The hops bouquet was readily apparent, and the tart citrus was balanced well with a lightly toasted malt.  Taste: I was a little surprised by the delicious bitter tartness from the citrus and hops. It's so clean, so sharply balanced...it really is the best pale I've had, from any nation. What can I say? The oldest Trappist brewery is still here for a reason. A damn good one.  Mouthfeel: The fruity and malty notes were so sharp...almost as if there were something clouding the clarity of other pale ales. It's like pale ale in HD.

Visible carbonation bubbles, white head, some lace.  S- Smelled just like a glass of champagne. Maybe some white grapes, spice, fruit?  T- I could not put my finger on the flavors on this one. Tasted winey, very similar to champagne. Somewhat peppery aftertaste with a spicy kick to it. A tart sweetness to it in the begining.  M- Mouthfeel was tingly and carbonated, some warming.

I needed a larger glass - I used a 11oz tulip glass which couldn't contain the head at all, so I had to wait and let it settle, pour some more in, drink some, etc.  Upon sniffing, my first thought was ""wine."" It's fruity and pleasant.  There's fruity notes in flavor the but a very different fruity than what I experience with IPAs. There are more notes of fruits like plum and grape. The finish nicely balances the beginning, and a potent aftertaste lingers. I can't call this world-class, but it's good.  The carbonation was a little harsh, but otherwise it was nice in the mouth.

Floral smell with some spice and sour. I think the way this beer transforms in our mouth from start to finish is unreal. There is a subtle Brett sour theme throughout the taste, but the other facets seem to change. Jason said it best; fresh cut hay, citrus, hops. Truly like walking from the barn to the orchard. The dryness of the finish makes you want another sip right away, making this a very expensive habit. Complex and Sensational.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

It has a nice dry flavor to coinside with the other flavors above. It is a crisp refreshing feel on the palate and carbonated as well to give it the extra umph!

Good active carbonation is visible and keeps the head around forever.  Smell is kind of weak, but becomes more pronounced with warming. Apricots, yeasty, sweet light malts, some grassy hops.  Has very bitter citrus rind type of flavor that hits right up front and really surprised me. I almost want to call it vinegar-like and I found this very distracting. This flavor sticks around long after leaving the mouth. I'm not sure if this is imparted by the hops. I initially thought this may be a bad bottle, but upon reading other reviews, I think this may be the character of the beer. Its a characteristic that I haven't experienced with other belgian pales or tripels.  No real detectable alcohol. Very dry with no real sweetness.  Creamy, light mouthfeel with a very light effervescent feel characteristic of Trappist ales. Bitterness limits drinkability.  Not one of the better Trappist ales I've had. Flavor is a little lacking.

Pours out with a very clear amber color, humongous head... white and fluffy..  Very pleasant bready smell with hints of citrus and hay and something underlying that is a little bit funky.  Quite a bit of carbonation present in the taste, a little fizzy on the mouthfeel. Nice taste of spicy malts and bread and just a hint of citrus....

Taking a very long time to collapse back down, but sticking vigorously to the side of the glass.  Light aroma of lemongrass and flowers. Banana and bread.  Taste is of dried hay (some call it barnyard/farm/horse), lemon peel, and with a sweet perfume up front. Finish is bitter and earthy. Still a bit of a crisp grassy/cholorphyl bite to it is as well, especially in the finish.  Drinkability isnt all there for me, but I am not taking points simply because it's not my style preference.

Unfortunately, the taste seems a bit off to me. Tastes as though the bitter white of an orange rind was added while brewing. The bitterness isn't good, and is unlike anything I've tasted in any other Trappist Ale. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth, but a bit high on the carbonation. Overall it does smooth out a bit at the end, but not a whole lot.

Head reduces to a thin foamy layer that laces perfectly.  Smell is floral and warm. Some yeast comming through. Taste is incredible. Floral, some lemon flavors, aged hop, hay-like quality. Everything in perfect balance. Ther real action begins after you let it clear your palate. The after taste dances all over. Notes of apple cider and fresh cut grass soak in. Feel is very dry and crisp. This is asking more more sips.  This is damn near perfect. This is a pleasure to drink and makes any bad day much better. If I could freeze this and ice skate on this then drink it in spring when it thaws, I would. Excellent beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,BMan1113VR,3.21,"Bottle brewed June 20, 2007 with 6.9% ABV indicated. My least favorite brew labeled Trappist that I have tasted thus far. Aroma was pretty nice but did have a slight off scent of sour milk or something similar (maybe chalk). Pours a beautiful amber-orange with a hazy, but still obviously sparkling content. Head is average size, rock, and only just off white. Flavor of mine was just salty and bitter, no real depth or character. Went down dry and metallicy at the end. It would take a bit of convincing for me to buy this again. Maybe I got a bad bottle, but I do not see why this is such a highly rated brew.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,FtownThrowDown,3.98,"Pours a light gold in color. Plenty of huge frothy head sits on top. Probably over two inches. Smell is yeasty, spicy, and floral. Taste is pretty good. There are some astringencies coming from the hops. There is a huge burst of fruity, floral tastes midway through the palate. Then a bittering dryness on the back end.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Gehrig,3.18,"Having heard much about the mystical Orval, I decided to finally try it and judge its complexity for myself. The fifth of the seven Trappist beers I've tried, it isn't easy to decide whether this is a work of genius or painful sub-mediocrity at first and, given my penchant for enjoying beers cold, I poured and tried this chilled. [Disclaimer: there is no advised serving temperature on the side, as is often the case.] At first, this was obstreperous, but thankfully improved as it warmed.  The presentation is very good--two fingers of dense off-white foam capping a cloudy, dark orange body. At first glance, it appears to be a kick-ass DIPA. The nose emits plenty of yeast, some hops, and a pungent, sour fruit taste that is perplexing. The taste is distinctly sour, a lemon-pucker taste accompanied by ardent yeast and a very dry, almost metallic taste that's impossible to ignore, and somewhat off-putting. The mouthfeel is a bizarre amalgam of bold carbonation and sour mash texture, producing a bully beer that makes you think twice about grabbing again.  I'm more than willing to finish off this one, especially at a fin a bottle, but won't grab this, ever, ahead of Trappistes, any Westmalle or Chimay, or even La Trappe. I'm going to presume that this is an acquired taste. I'm also going to allow myself the latitude to acquire it at my own pace, which might come at the twelfth of never. Not my cup of trappistes, to be honest. While far different in style and taste, Chimay Grand Reserve, Westmalle Tripel, and Trappistes Rochefort 8 are far superior, as are a number of American Belgian-style offerings.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Plenty of lacing left on the glass.  S- Smells of malt and yeast. A bit lemony also.  T- Fruity. Lemony and yeasty. A slightly bitter finish.  M- Medium bodied. Lively and tingly from the carbonation.  D- A very nicely balanced beer. Easy drinking.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,morimech,4.2,"Bottled on 30/01/2007 Best before 30/01/2012.  A pour into a chalice a large pillowish white head forms. It takes some time for the head to settle to a thick cap to see what the fluid looks like. The beer is a cloudy amber. As it is drunk a large amount of lacing is left on the glass.  Smell is somewhat like a dry white wine. Very fruity such as passion fruit and pears with some floral hints.  Taste is fruity with a very dry finish at first. As it warms it takes on a earthy aspect with a bit of lemon and grass thrown in. I think I know what people mean by ""horse blanket"" now. It has that sort of finish. Carbonation makes the beer tingle on the tongue like champagne. I think that is well suited for this beer as it matches well for the light body and flavor.  A very interesting and flavorful beer but the cost and alcohol content does not make this a frequent drinker for me.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Produced a large frothy white head (2-3 fingers) over a slightly hazy amber to golden-colored body  Aromas of lemon, yeast, and some hops  Starts off with a lemon and grass taste, then finishes with a dry hoppy bitterness. Good complexity.  Nice smooth body with a decent amount of carbonation  The smooth mouthfeel and dry finish makes this beer very drinkable for me.  Overall, another trappist beer that's definitely worth trying.

37,129,MrIncognito,4.7,"Poured from a 11.2oz bottle into a wine glass (I really need to get a chalice). Brewed-on date 15/3/07 best before 15/03/12.  Pours a golden yellow, slight haze with a great billowing head. Lacing all over the glass. Champaign-like bubbles.  Smell is definite lemon, lemon grass. Sweet with slight hops in the background.  Taste is dry and sweet, yet quenching. I really taste some lemon overtones with hop bitterness on the back of my tongue. Carbonation gives a very Champaign feel. Gets better and better as I drink it and as it warms up. Less carbonation midway through. The alcohol is not all too noticable but does have a warming effect midway through. Becomes less dry towards the end.  This is a great beer any time of year. I can't wait to drink this on a summer night out on the deck. I'd be curious to see what more aging will do to this beer... guess I gotta buy a few more.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,theopholis,4.25,"Appearance- Body is a crystal clear, light brownish/copper color with tinges of orange. Continually effervesces. A lot. The head is a huge, white, rocky affair with significant staying power and lacing. Looks quite tasty.  Smell- Very potent aroma to start with. Lots of classic Belgian ale smell. Barnyard, horse-blanket, wet diaper stuff going on there. Some malt sweetness comes through. Hints of fresh fruit and earth. Yup. this is a Trappist ale.!!!  Taste- Very complex, sweet, malty flavor mingles with the brett flavor. A strong vinegar-sour on the tip of your tounge. I'm not much on Trappist ales, but I have to admit, this stuff is pretty good.  Mouthfeel -Pretty light body. And quite pleasant with the carbonation level. I've found a high percentage of Belgian ales that were over-carbonated. this one is just about perfect. You can actually taste the beer over the CO2 bite.  Drinkability- Well worth trying.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,jamie2dope,4.53,"As far as I am concerned, this is the most mysterious of the Trappist beers in that it tastes like none of the others. Poured in to my Westmalle chalice a beautiful golden orange color, with an impressively sturdy white head. Aroma has lots of lemony zest, a bit of barnyard funk, and an almost salty character. Flavor starts off dry and carbonated, much like champaign, then has qualities of lemon, horse blanket, minerals, and a faint hint of pears. This beer is light to medium in body, and has a cool ability to scrub the palate dry with all of the carbonation going on within it. I would love to have more than one of these in a sitting, one of these days when i have the money I am going to buy a case. Inspiring beer we have right here. The complexity is endless with this one. I especially like the fact that it has some funk similar to some of the Lambics of Belgium, and the Wild Ales of America. Although they are all exceptional, Orval has jumped toward the top of the list for best Trappist beer. Cheers",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

It had a slight fruity taste and a nice tart taste to me  Overall, I would love to try this again. I was only able to have a couple oz at the beerfest I tried this at however I would love to knock a bottle or two down of this.  Edit: I picked up a bottle of this finally. I'm so glad I did.

Lacing doesn't venture too far from the head.  S - Very pungent fruity yeastiness, lemony citrus, peppery malts.  T/M - Starts out thick, in texture and taste, dry oatty malts with a bit of citrus and some light biting carbonation. Yeasts come in lemony and bittersweet. Unique finish, almost aromatic, like tea with lemon in it; yeasty.  D - A unique experience overall and very drinkable if not for the elevated price.

37,129,becktone,4.05,"Eye: Looks great. Excellent head retention and lacing with a large, sticky, rocky dirty white head. Color is light brownish copper orange and is very clear. One of the best I've ever seen of this type of style that I've sampled.  Nose: Very potent aroma to start with. As soon as the cap is popped Co2 is visible leaking out from under the cap where it is no longer airtight, as the snake of visible white gas slithers out from under the cap a strong aroma is immediately present. The aroma here is a sweet very strong malt smell. Some spiciness is present as well, mayhaps from the alcohol. Also a bit of fruit and earth type aromas in there...a little sour maybe some brett? reminds me of the mulchy aroma I got from Jolly Pumpkin's Bam Noire.  Tongue: Sweet malt flavor mingles with the brett flavor(at least what I am perceiving to be brett..that is an earthy character, wood mulch) and ultimately seems that the brett wins out, but wait then the sweet malt comes back at the end to give a nice balance to the earthiness of the brew. Not as complex or as sweet as I thought it'd be but still a good brew nonetheless.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability: The beer has a very fluffy and light mouthfeel, exactly what the rocky head suggests. It is also high in carbonation and finishes dry. The beer is easy to drink, something that is definitely a sipper, but I don't think that I'll buy it again all that soon. I don't believe that it is worth the $4-5 per 11.2 oz bottle. This beer just doesn't speak to me, good but not something I'd regularly drink.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

A - Poured a rich amber with an orange hue into a chalice. Millions of little white bubbles jump for joy!!  S - The smell of the Belgian yeast is very nice. Fruits such as cherries are abound. The clash of earthiness and subtle fruit makes this a very appetizing aroma.  T - Fruity upfront, just like the smell. After that there is a very light and distinct hop finish. This is a very complex array of flavors let me assure you.  M - Very bubbly and bursting kinda like champagne. Quickly fades to a smooth follow with a perfect amount of carbonation.

The beer pours tons of beautiful white creamy head with a nice murky amber/red color. The beer smells sweet of pears and banana with just a hint of alcohol. The tastes follows suit with first hints of pear followed by some maltiness and alcohol and then finishing with a little bitter hoppy kick. The mouthfeel is really creamy and smooth with very little carbonation.

If there is one way I can describe this beer, it is very similar to champagne in some aspects. The high carbonation and light body lend themselves to this description. It has a delicate flavor that goes with the light, ultra carbonated mouthfeel. All in all, I really enjoyed this beer.

37,129,MiScusi,4.4,"12/27/08 Had for the second time, this time at Rosemary's Restaurant in Las Vegas. Beer was served in an Orval goblet. This time around I thought the smell and taste were even better. It just seemed a little more musty/earthy and rustic overall, which really gives this beer character.  ___ 1/5/08 Poured into a Chimay glass, pours a dark golden orange with a really big airy bright white head, almost resembling whipped egg whites. The aroma I get is only a mild brett sourness. The taste is very hard to describe. The flavor is light. There is a little bit of tartness, definitely some other Belgian yeast earthiness, and even some white wine-like alcohol taste. The mouthfeel is light, effervescent and finishes pretty dry.

37,129,DoubleJ,4.3,"As I warm up the bottle from the fridge, let me tell you a story: I was inside an SAQ in Montréal. I didn't think I'd buy a beer I could easily get at home, but the price tag was attractive: $3.30! And that's with taxes! This goes for $2 more in my area. So what I have here is a double import. The label is a double as well; there's a bilingual label on this one (because it was bought in Québec). Well, now I think it's time to serve this up. On to the beer:  I can already smell the aroma as I slowly lifted the bottle cap. But let's not get ahead, let me pour in into a chalice first. Hot damn, that's a lot of foam on top. Let me go to the kitchen and chop off part of its head so i can pour the rest in...  Head retention is excellent on top of this deep golden colored brew. Okay, now I can smell the fruits of this beer. Candi sugar and peaches, mmm. A little spice as well. Oh boy, I'm getting excited...  I was expecting a sweet treat, and instead got something different. It's just a little sweet. I should note the balance is very nice, but the overall flavor is missing something. It's more of a grassy/hay taste, with aspirin echoing in the background. The alcohol, despite being at 6.9, is camouflaged. A little sourness in the back. Now I'm starting to get used to the taste, so now I can show some appeciation for this work. I'm turned on to it in a weird kind of way.  Okay, so it wasn't what I thought it would be.

Scent is soft and sour. I detected some graininess to the smell as well...the smell isn't a high point of this beer.  Taste is pleasant.

It is quite a sour beer, with lots of grapefruit and other citrus, pears, apples and plums. There is a slight hop taste and bitterness at the finish. M - Perfect feel to this beer, neither too tingly or thick. D - Only so-so, the beer is too complex to enjoy very much of, and the medicine taste starts to get to me after a short while.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,AKBelgianBeast,4,"I would have given this beer a higher rating, but I did a vertical tasting of it and was not so impressed with the younger vintage. I had an 04 and an 06 in december 07. The 04 pours significantly clearer ( as expected ) than the 06. The 06 was fairly cloudy, decent head and malty and hoppy nose. But the O4 was much better. very vinous nose, with flemish tones, but not to strong. the sips proved hoppy and vinous as well. a pleasant sourness, yet a sweet finish with citrusy flavor. Store this one for two years or more for a noticable improvement. unique abbey ale unlike any other authentic trappist ales.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,PittBeerGirl,3.76,A- This is one beautiful beer. Cloudy translucent pale yellow body that pours with giant 3+ finger white head that slowly settles to 1 1/2 finger and with great retention. Plenty of lacing is left behind in the glass.  S- Floral hops are noticed first followed by Belgian yeast and a peppery spice-somewhat of a funky ale yeast strain.  T- Initial taste is dominated by carbonation but lots of Belgian yeast and hints of peppery spice can be detected. The finish is a kick of bitter hops and peppery spice that was surprising to me considering the style. Lingering is a mild hop bitterness and hints of yeast and peppery spice.  M- High carbonation and medium weight body heavy in yeast and alcohol. Not as smooth as I expected on the swallow.  D- I am probably harsh since this is a style that I like and it just didn't live as far up to my expectations. It is actually good and easy to drink overall but it doesn't stand out to me. I would it buy it much more often if it were more affordable.,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,Patrick999,4.18,"I didn't know what I wanted to drink, then noticed a lone Orval in the fridge. Score!  Poured into an Ommegang chalice. Lumpy head sticks around forever. Cloudy amber, visibly active carbonation. The head did not once quit on me, hanging tough until the very end.  Nose is of sweet black cherry, and a good bit of sour, cidery funk. Not lacking at all - very nice beer to sniff.  Slight brett sourness upfront, with lots of medicinal hop and peppery clove drying things out on the back end. Seems ultra-dry; not much residual sweetness at all. It's a bit of a gob-smacking taste that newcomers to this beer may not necessarily enjoy. However, the combination of hoppy, sour and dry makes for a refreshing beer.  Like other Trappist beers, this feels wispy yet crisp, as if taking a ride on a band of high cirrus. Such a delicate, careful touch. Exceptional.  (Relatively) low ABV helps this along the drinkability road, but the dry, herbal complexities might be a bit much after a while.

Taste: Straightforward, yet complex. The yeast and hop flavors evolve with each sip. Spicy, citrus flavors finish with an acidic quality. The alcohol is evident but not overpowering.  Mouthfeel: Medium-light. This made this brew go down extremely smoothly. I want to try a fresher bottle to see if aging has made a difference in this area.

Brett and hop aroma some aromas of wild flowers seems to come about, same 2 elements (brett and hops) take the front row seat in flavor as well. Carbonation is prickly and makes you want to take another gulp... if this came in huge 3L, bombers I'd not work for I'd drink all day for shure.

37,129,Rudgers73,4.08,"Poured into my Duvel tulip very slowly. There is a huge plume of head that fills a full 2/3 of the glass while the amber beer sites underneath. The beer is amber/orange color and incredibly clear for having been bottle conditioned. The carbonation billows from the etched Duvel ""D"". The head sticks with great lacing as it settles down after a few long minutes. I smell the head as it begins to fall and I smell a hop aroma (maybe Saaz) and metallic brett funk. As the head clears more I can faintly smell pale malt and peppery yeast. The taste is much more funky and bitter than I had anticipated. The sweet pale malt is almost entirely covered up with a literal blanket or warm, soft brett. The finish is then dry and metallic. This aftertaste and mouthfeel effect make the beer quite a unique offering, and although it has a seemingly one-sided flavor profile there is adjustment that can be made based on temperatures that the beer is served at. Very complex in that aspect. As far as drinkability, it is great. As far as affordability, it is not so great. I'll call this a special occasion beer; maybe to serve at a birthday or for New Years.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,buzzworthy,4.32,"The bottle is dated 7/5/07, making it four months old at drinking (couldn't wait). The beer pours a slightly hazy amber with a huge, billowy head, leaving remnants of lace. The aroma has a freshness to it that reminds me of the ocean, with malt fruitiness underpinning it. Orval's taste is of mellow black cherries and plums, not as intense as the American brewed Belgian-style Ommegang that I am more familiar with, but seemingly more balanced. The hops add some bite and the finish is quite dry.The intense carbonation does not bother me and Orval seems surprisingly drinkable.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Rzzzzz,3.7,"As you look at these overall scores for Orval, you might be interested to know that there was once a Major League pitcher named Orval Overall. In fact, he was the winning pitcher for the Cubs the day they won their last World Series. You can look it up.  Flash forward 99 years to my first taste of Oval Trappist Ale. I'd heard nice things about this beer, and it did not let me down.  Poured into a wine glass. Hazy yellow/orange. Nice frothy head and good lacework. Aroma a mixed bag--can't put my finger on anything specific other than maybe apples and of course beer--but there's clearly a lot going on here. Fruity taste gives way to a slightly sour aftertaste that lingers for a while then tugs at you for another refreshing sip. Goes down smooth.  First time I've seen the stuff and now I'm kicking myself for only coming home with one. I could drink a lot of Orval, overall. Speaking of pitchers.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Taste is slow to develop, and gradually fades into a sour taste with a long lingering hoppy? dryness. As it warmed, sour tastes came out with more of a cider feel to it, with an earthy aftertaste.  Taste is smooth and light, a lot of tingly carbonation.  It's more of a sipper for me, drinkability-wise.  I guess I'm in the minority, but this didn't really do it for me.

You just know you are in for a treat. Maybe a touch of apple in the smell as well I'd say.  Taste. Oh the taste. Wonderful horse blanket funkiness with a nice, mellow tartness. Apple cider. Earthy, slightly sweet malts. There is a wonderful complexity here - especially given the relatively low ABV. I really need to age some bottles of this...  Mouthfeel is well carbonated but appropriate for this beer. Both rich and light at the same time. Nice dry finish.

Probably one of the better beer presentations I've seen.  Smell: Lemon, freshly cut grass, oily hops with a big bright citrus character, still-developing barnyard funk and just a hint of sweet, fruity malt.  Taste/mouthfeel: Very dry in the mouth, exhibiting both bitter and tart flavors. It's fruity, but not sweet at all - it has more of a sour, acidic fruit character. Ample hopping lends a pine-like flavor. Slick and oily on the tongue, with a long-lasting dry finish.

It took a while to get it all into the glass. I tried to leave the yeast in the bottom of the bottle, and not in my glass. It is a deep golden color and slightly cloudy, reminding me of cider in the fall. I smelled a mix of fruity, malty, nutty tang, like citrus and berries and brown sugar with a kick. And maybe just because it looked like cider, I thought I got a hint of apple. At 6.9% ABV, there was a bit of the alcohol sting in the scent as well.  The first sip seems tart, and then warms into a more sweeter flavor, almost a sticky consistency, but finished quite dry. I loved it, but I don't know if I would have many more than one at a time.

The beer has quite a bit of lacing as well.  S: I see many reviewers really point out the smell. Maybe I am getting sick, but the beer doesn't seem to have a distinctive scent at all. In fact, I really cant detect any aroma at all even in a tulip glass.  T: Of all the Trappist Ales I have had, this is the least enjoyable to me personally. It has a very earthy type taste and it gets even stronger as you swallow. Although not my cup of tea, I can see why others would enjoy this one.  M: The mouthfeel is totally dominated by the insane amount of carbonation in this one. As you swish the beer in your mouth it continues to create more and more bubbles. It has very little viscosity, but seems to match others in this same style.  D: It doesn't have an overbearing alcohol flavor at all in the mouth. However, the carbonation in this one is so dramatic that I knocked down the drinkability score a couple notches.  Although my scores may not seem to reflect it, this is by no means a bad brew.

Not quite alcohol, but of something that would contain alcohol, like a cough syrup. Also sweet and slightly malty...its hard to get away from the medicinal smell.  Also medicinal. Though if one concentrates one can find extremely sweet (like brown sugar) malts with a floral aftertaste that is pretty good if you like savory-type beers and foods.  Very crisp, clean, and full. A mouthfeel that is very full of life and opportunity.  While this is a really iteresting beer, I must say that I am disappointed in my own review points. I thought it would be higher, but the last couple times I tried it, it was after I had had a few other brews.

I guess it's possible that I got a bad bottle, but if this is what this beer is supposed to taste like, it is an acquired taste that I shall not pursue.

The flavor is dry, not a lot of sweetness left. I taste a nice lemony flavor, but different from the typical citrus flavors from hops.

Really great, modest yet true, hop character. to me, this is near perfection. nice body, great mouthfeel. carbonation carries it through flawlessly.  edit - 8/19/2010... found a stash of these at my local harris teeter that are almost three years old. good luck finds them in perfect condition. i know the brewery thinks that they taste their best at six months, but these babies are awesome. real bretty funk and barn abound with a perfect balance of sweet, sour and bitter. really amazing. just had to add this: if i had to be stranded on a desert island with one beer, this would be it.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

The nose is exceptional and one of the most distinctive. Notes of floral hops, some fruitiness, grass, earth and as BuckeyeNation said ""I do pick up quite a bit of the so-called 'horse barn' smell"", he nailed it with that description.

I really dig this smell and could sit here and sniff this beer all night, but, alas thirst takes over. The taste is tart and dry with hints of leather and earth - all kinds of hop flavors dancing around as well. Finishes with plenty of bitterness to give it a real crisp finish.

The head was out of control, at least 3 fingers and i couldn't even finish pouring the bottle because there was no room. The retention was excellent, the lacing left was like big puffy clouds that just clung to the sides of the glass and just wouldn't move.  The smell was good, not a lot of hops as this bottle is about a year and a half old but there was some fruitiness and some alcohol in the smell. It tastes dry, fruity with some alcohol, the hops on this have definately faded with age. I hear it is pretty hoppy when it is fresh. It is well carbonated and medium bodied.

37,129,McStagger,3.98,"Not my first Trappist Ale to drink, but my first to review.  A: Poured into official Orval goblet. Beer pours an extremely hazy brownish orange with an inch of orange/off-white head. Head retention is good, with decent lacing. No carbonation visible except in head.  S: The scent is that of dried orange rind, coriander, honey, clove and lemon zest with hints of candied sugar and bubble gum.  T: The forefront is the same citrus zest. However, it is interwoven with mild soap-like phenols at the beginning of the mid-palate. The citrus and soap notes carry into the mid palate, with the citrus notes dying about halfway through the mid-palate. The soap notes are picked up and accentuated by hop bitterness, which both transition beautifully into the finish, which is (finally) hit by the sugar and spice-box. A tinge of hop bitterness mixed in ensure a long finish on this beer.  M: A crisper front and drier finish than what would be expected from an ale of such flavor. Kinda throws ya off.  D: Easier to drink than a lot of Trappists, sure. The flavor intensity can throw some people off. (Along with the price).  This is the first beer I've reviewed on here in which I did not particularly care for the beer, but could not deny the quality it exhibited.

Earthy notes on the backend of a subtle sourness. Citrus and barnyard rolled into one very tasty brew.  Overall, this is a delicious and refreshing beer. It caught me off guard.

Served at cellar temp.  a: I very carefully decanted about 10oz. of the 11.2oz. in the bottle to leave sediment behind. This pour left behind a very clear golden ale with an inch and a half of very frothy looking head. Lots of tiny bubbles (cue music) race to the top of my glass throught the session.  s: I'm surprised by how noticeable the hop aroma is. I've never smelled a peppery hop before. This is one of my favorite beers to whiff, very unique.  t: The pepper I noticed in the smell is also abundant on the tongue. It starts with a spicy yeast/malt flavor, no sweetness to found here. Next the suprisingly bold peppery hops kicks in before making way for a tart bready finish. The peppery hops linger for minutes afterward. Very complex and a challenge to describe.  m: In a word, incredible. Sticky and viscous, I've never had anything like it.  d: Hmm. Definitely a sipper. I certainly would not want two in a session, in fact a couple of weeks in between sounds better.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,jdubjacket,3.53,"I had higher expections for this beer.  Poured an amber color from the bottle. The head starts off strong and dissipates fairly quickly.  The smell and taste are somewhat citrusy. Unfortunately the smell is better than the taste. For a trappist ale, this beer is lacking in the taste & mouthfeel. Overall, I prefer the other trappist ales.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,maddogruss,3.11,"I expected more from this brew.  A: Poured a amber body with a thick, off-white head with very good retention.  S: A sweet, malty smell with hints of alcohol pervading the nostrils a little bit.  T: Not too much of a taste, which surprised me. There were some slight malt characteristics, but tasted pretty dry and grainy. Very surprising to me for a Belgian Pale Ale.  M: There was a lot of carbonation in this beer. reminded me a little bit of seltzer water.  D: This beer does not seem to drinkable. It started out okay - great appearance and decent smell - but ended poorly with a minimal taste and a lot of carbonation.  For the top beer in its category on BA, I was not too impressed. I think Duvel was a much better Belgian Pale Ale.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Ratman197,4.42,"Bottle dated 4 1996 poured a clear golden amber with a small lasting light amber head.  The nose was fullof tropical fruits, citrus and cookie. there were also some light vanilla notes and a hint of leather.  The mouthfeel was light bodied and crisp with some dryness and lighty tart.  The flavor was fruity with some straw and cookie, light leather and a bit of carmel. It was even more complex but hard to find words for all the flavors going on . It finishes crisp dry and a bit tart.  This beer was very drikable and aged amazingly well with no hints of oxidation.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,udubdawg,4.75,"11.2 oz bottle - this is not an everday beer for me by a longshot, but when I'm in the mood for some ""funk"", there is no better beverage to turn to.  Pours a hazy light orange color. Several yeast chumks have made it into the glass despite by best efforts. Head is nearly white and very large, lasting for a while before subsideing to an uneven cap, leaving some spotty lacing throughout the glass.  Absolutely full of flowery, funky, barnyardy, lemony scent. Fantastic, and I smile knowing that most of my friends would recoil - I'm still working on them.  Carbonation is quite high and the body a bit light, but neither takes take away from the taste, which is perhaps just short of the aroma. It really defies description, as I expect ""Orval-like"" will be rather unhelpful to readers of this review...but it really is unique, crisp, a bit sour, and full of spice and phenolics, with a fantastic drying and bittering finish.  Though not overly strong, this is the rare brew where I find myself wanting to sip and enjoy, trying in vain to taste all that is there. A single bottle is very drinkable - I doubt I'd ever session this, but I'd be willing to give it a try!",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,adowney523,4.12,Poured from a 11.2 oz bottle into a Belgian-style chalice. Bottled on 7/11/2006. Color is a deep amber and appearance is slightly hazy. Lots of carbonation produces a white head that retains well and leaves excellent lacing.  Smells of floral esters with a slight sour twang.  Malt taste upfront is rather toasty. The floral esters are abundant and really overpower the toasty malt. Herbal and citrus fruit hints compliment the floral flavors.  Mouthfeel is characterized by the heavy carbonation and semi-dry finish.  Very drinkable and enjoyable.,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,bluemoonswoon,4.65,"11.2 oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. Bottled on 1/30/07, best before date of 1/30/12 so I think I'm in the clear here.  A: Pours a cloudy orangish brownish color (sort of like laqured wood) with a big and puffy inch and a half off white head that fades rather quickly into a thin cap. Big and bubbly as well with nice pockets of carbonation bubbling along the sides of the glass. The only thing I don't like is the head is not as luxurious as I was hoping for and the lacing was a bit lacking but that was probably my fault.  S: Sweet candied sugar with a big yeasty funk, delicate fruity aromas peek through the yeast just enough to be noticed. Also, I am crazy or does this stuff smell like potpourri?  T/MF: Yeasty and along with a great deal of carbonation that balloons in the mouth and tickles the tongue. This one also has quite a deal of spicy herbal tones along with bits of apple and grapefruit intermixed that increases as the beer warms, an interesting balance to say the least. Has a sort of sour aftertaste as soon as the beer is swallowed but becomes a bit floral and fruity after a bit and is quite enjoyable.  D: Damn well balanced beer in every respect, not overpowering in any way, shape or form, just solid in the taste department every respect. It's going to be real hard to top this one.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,kernalklink,3.02,"Nice presentation, great looking brew with aromas that were mouthwatering- earthy malts, sweet berry lambic sourness and a yeasty tang. Mouthfeel was an explosion of carbonation, very light and airy and tongue tingling. the taste was missing for me- after a hit of hop bitters all that i was left with was a bready yeasty bitterness, and some grassy, watered down malts. I was dissapointed, as the flavors could not even hide the slight ABV present- there are better belgians out there in my opinion.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,DaveUK,2.9,"Appearance - Cloudy, brown-orange with a large frothy head that persisted all the way down the glass.  Aroma - Sweet fruit, spicy hops and a hint of yeast soon after pouring.  Taste - Tart, bitter fruit with a citrusy flavour. Alcohol and light malt present in the long bitter finish.  Mouthfeel - Medium and persistant. Almost unpleasant acidic bite perhaps due to a high level of carbonation.  Drinkability - Powerful bitter taste and potent, unconcealed alcohol make this a beer for sipping at the best of times.  Not one I would be consuming regularly, however I would give it another shot, if only to see if the bottle I had was off/skunked in some way.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,bruachan,3.71,"this bottle had been stored warm so the carbonation was a little crazy. i didn't get much of a first pour, in terms of sediment. good lacing though, when all the foam subsided, and some fuzz still lingered at the beer's surface. nice orangy-gold hue  spicy aroma with hops and a hint of oxidation. sweet and funky with cork  bitter with a slight vinuous character. i think i'm drinking this bottle just in time. the malt profile is slight as is the moutheel. this one is reasonably refreshing, actually. i've heard this is a love or hate beer but i'm not sure that's the case for me. i dig it, though i'm not in love. i would love to try it on draft",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,BucBasil,2.44,"Appearance: Poured into a tulip from a bottle. Said it was bottled in July of 2006, so it's now over a year old. Drink before date is July 2011, so I guess this one could definitely benefit from aging. Poured a deep amber with hints of brown. The head was off-white with a massive head that I had to wait for before I could finish pouring. Good looking brew all-around though.  Smell: Interesting smell of earth and herbs. Alcohol is definitely evident here, and overpowers any other smell that could be sensed by my nose.  Taste: Not very good at all, which is very disappointing for a Trappist beer. I have very high standards for these guys, and Orval does not come close. I must admit, the beer improves as it warms a bit, but not by much. Tastes earthy with an alcohol finish. There's something very chemicalish and offputting about the middle and finish of the beer, with a horrid aftertaste lingering around for a while after. Since the taste was so distracting I couldn't really focus on the mouthfeel of this one. It seemed nice - not too carbonated, but enough.  Drinkability: I won't be buying one of these for a long time. I don't think I could have a second even if I had another one in the fridge. I'm struggling through the first one as it is... Perhaps it drastically improves with age, but I won't be trying it anytime soon.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Smell has a dry citrus aroma along with some sweet spice. Taste is dry, slightly harsh,earthy and citrusy with a bit of hop and carbonation having a good mouthfeel, but nothing that really stands out. Not what I expected it to be in a $6.00 11.2oz bottle, but I'm willing to give it another try in a well aged bottle.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

T - Fruit right off the start, but it is quickly washed away. Mmm... yummy funkiness creeps in. Earthy goodness through to the end, and the hop bitterness compliments it all the more. I'm having trouble describing these flavours, but the finish and aftertaste are just wonderful.  M - Generous carbonation creates a light fullness.  D - Refreshing as can be for a sturdy beer, this is my kinda drink.  I only tried an Orval once before at a beer bar. I enjoyed it immensely at the time, but it's even better now where I can concentrate and fully appreciate everything it has to offer. One of my all time favourites.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,basica,3.48,"This is my second Orval and it was a better experience as this time round it was served in my very own Orval trappist chalice and also maybe because I was able to better appreciate this controversial taste. It pours out into my Orval chalice a slightly dark and murky golden color with a big bubbly head. It smells of yeasts and malts and the signature orval smell; the taste itself malty and with the strong signature orval taste which I believe is owing to a certain style of fermentation or something manipulation of the malts. I am not sure how to describe the taste except a wierd bready fermentation somewhat which gives the taste strength and character despite the low ABV of 6.2. Some people found this taste pungent; I felt that it was pretty ok but does not impress me. Some dashes of citrus and spices included in the taste packet. The slightly bitter finish was pretty nicely blended in and the after taste is richly malty, yeasty and spicey with a bready touch which increases as the after taste lingers. In terms of mouthfeel, the Orval should be around medium body with a pretty high level of carbonation. It was fairly smooth but not really. Generally OK on the drinkability but could work better on the mouthfeel and drinkability. Not as smooth as I would like it to be. Nonetheless quite a unique beer on the whole and worth the experience. I may do some aged Orvals in future.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,JustinBathurst,3.82,"Poured cloudy copper (more on the yellow side of things) with a frothy cream-coloured head that remained throughout.  The aroma is floral, with cloves and bubblegum.  The mouthfeel is smooth with heavy carbonation, making it a bit hot on the tongue.  The taste is bitter and tart lemon, with some olive and honeysuckle. The slight warming alcoholic notes are present as well, but overall, it feels like a wit. The aftertaste is of citrus peel and cloves.  A nice beer, but a bit too simple to compell me to always reach for a glass. It does keep its head above water, however.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Rich. Perfumy.  Mouth: Dry and sour, crisp and foamy and chewy. Strange hop bitterness in the finish. Bret is more present in the flavor than the aroma. Bitter melon rind taste. Mellows as it warms.

Even with careful decanting, the ale produced a huge head that turned to what best could be compared to melted ice cream. The color was of wheat and looked great.

37,129,ablaze,4.73,"I am very impressed with this one. Bottle looks a bit unique but it is appealing.  I was under the assumption that this beer would be more straw-coloured like Duvel, but upon pour it is a mellow orange with some cloudiness. What impressed me was the head. A creamy light beige that sticks around to the end. This beer just looks delicious from the get-go.  Smell is light, but reminds me of something. Took me a few sniffs but yes! Cotton candy. It's faint, but it's there and reminds me of warm summer evenings at the fair. A bit of cinnamon and biscuits, too.  The taste is remarkable and makes this one of my favourite Belgians already. The malt/hops combination is mild and stays with you for quite a while and is quite flowery, which I like. A very nice pale ale. There's nothing overpowering and the complexity and evolution from taste to finish is astounding. A+++, I'm very impressed. Alcohol taste is nonexistant.  Smooth and creamy with a bit of an effervescence from the alcohol that quickly dissipates. Silky and clings to your mouth, leaving you wanting more. Very appealing quality.  This is something I would drink again and again. There's several cheese, fish and poultry pairings I am going to love to try with this, and I could see myself stocking a few of these for personal pleasure and special guests.

M - Bone dry and highly carbonated.

Foam turns rocky and clings to everything in large clumps on the way down the sides of my glass to a massive broken reef of foam with a lagoon to one side.  Nose is a firm clove and sour banana, with just the slightest wisp of bubble gum. Palate is just a one-dimensional citrus sour with the bight of carbonation.

The beer poured a cloudy brownish gold with a head that lasted through the entire trappist glass. The carbonation was very evident in the glass. The aroma was spicy and fruity, not as yeasty as an Abbey Quadrupel. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with medium carbonation. The taste was not to my liking. The upfront taste was alright, but there was a lime-like bitterness on the back of the tongue. A very good beer, but not a great beer for me.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,goochpunch,5,"Bottled on 27/3/07.  Pours out a hazed apricot with abundant carbonation and a humongous, thick head which looks like whipped egg whites. Leaves some raised, bubbly lacing. Smell is a mix of pale malts, light toast, fruit and spice (coriander, passion fruit, banana, apple), and an overall bretty funk. Hops are pretty forward in the smell and come off as herbal and grassy. Flavor starts off with some yeasty fruit and spice atop a malty backbone. Hops start to peak out in the middle and remind me of rosemary. Finish comes around as extremely dry, a tad sour, and with some funk. Mouthfeel is rather light , but not watery by any means, and has a carbonation that is bubbly and lively, but manages to be extremely smooth at the same time. It's hard to keep the glass down with this one. Incredible.  I highly recommend this one as fresh as possible.

A: pours an orange brown color, somewhat hazy, with a substantial slightly off-white head that forms a rocky surface as it dissipates. Lacing as it is consumed.  S: A little outdoor-like, sweet/sour fruit, earthy, grainy. Tough to get specific on the fruit flavor.  T: Begins with the earthy, slightly sour fruit flavor, which lingers for awhile before ending in a dry hoppy bitterness. Upon further reflection the fruit flavor reminds of sour cherries, and is combined with a woody-cherry-pit-like flavor. Somewhat like a geueze with muted characteristics.  M: good amount of carbonation, average body tending a little toward the lighter side.  D: A very drinkable beer among the Trappists, this beer is not as high in alcohol content and is very refreshing. Not as puckering as a geueze but just enough sourness to give it a subtle uniqueness vs other Trappists.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

The complexity in the aroma of this beer is amazing. I detect a slight sweet malt scent upfront that is almost candy-like. I smell some very floral hop tones floating above bits of breadiness and a distinct spicy smell. It's very difficult to break them down into separate pieces, because it' so well woven together into a beautiful olfactory tapestry. There is nothing else like this.  The taste is very similar to the smell, except that there is more hop bitterness and less sweetness than the smell indicates. Nice malt tones upfront leading into that amazing floral/spicy/bready taste accompanied by the bitterness. It finishes surprisingly dry, with a very pleasant lingering floral taste and bitterness.  Body is rather light, carbonation in abundance.  A truely unique experience from start to finish, which is a rare find. The complexities in this beer are amazing, and it's ridiculously drinkable. This should be a mandatory addition to every BA's ""wants"" list.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

In a short snifter this one poured out two full fingers, about half the glass, with a very careful pour, and actually continued to rise. While it is staggering and impressive, it's somewhat of an impediment to actual consumption.  A little bit of citric fruit, and also floral, but there's an aroma that I can't quite place. Slightly herbal, maybe like aloe, fresh and spring-like. A little more power and it's a-one.  Slightly tart, with a bit of funkiness, carbonation is high. Crisp and refreshing, not overpowering on any count of flavor. Hops are minimal but present, lending a little bit of grassy flavor, along with the lemon from the nose. Finish is extremely dry and tart. Tasty and complex. Hints towards juniper, with a little pine backup.  Unexceptional Trappist ale, not meant really to wow, but a timeless recipe and great for cooking and pairing.

Had a rocky head the lasted for a pronounced duration. Lots of lacing. S: I wasn't overwhelmed with any particular scent. A mixture of yeast and a little hops I'd say. There is definitley some fruity overtones, though what fruit, I couldn't say. Alcohol hidden well. T: Awesome, it almost finished like a lager in my opinion. Finished clean and crisp. Not a lot of aftertast at all. Taste confirmed the yeast smell and also the citrus fruits. Not very hoppy in my opinion. It was well hidden if it was. As I said, hang was minimal, but while on the pallet, it was great, and not overbearing. M: Very smooth. Nothing too heavy, yet nothing too light. Enough presence to let you know what you were drinking was something of quality. D: At 6.2% alcohol, this may not be the ideal session beer. Down with that theory. This was great. The bottle was rendered empty before I knew it and I was left wanting another.

T: Wow, o' so complex. I don't know where to begin. First the delicious aromatic hops hit you, with the great brett notes to follow. I taste wool, rosemary, sage, grass, old leather, lots of lemon/orange, horse blankets, and some lactic acidity.  M: Incredible - very dry and bitter - so appetizing. The carbonation works wonders and just dances on your tongue.  D: Incredibly drinkable for a beer of this complexity, it can be used as an aperitif, as a perfect complement to a multitude of dishes, or as a perfect drink just by itself. This is my favourite all time beer, I knew it from the first moment I tried it. An absolute masterpiece, I can't say enough about it. Absolutely worth the $4.79 I paid for it. How this isn't in the top 100 is beyond me, but maybe it's just a little too odd and different with the brett. But in my opinion, if this beer is available anywhere in your area - go buy it now.  Edit (6/2010) - Looking back 5 years almost since I first had Orval. This beer is King. At it's peak nothing can overcome. The complexities and flavours in this beer are just incredible, I don't know what could make it better. This beer is almost $6 now, and it's still the best bargain in the beer world.

Malt flavours are fairly subdued. This was a 4 month old bottle so the bacterial, lambic flavours of the aged beer had not yet had a chance to develop. Good levels of flavour for the alcohol content - I wish some beers almost twice the strength had as much taste.  M: Good body - perhaps slightly over carbonated, although appropriate for the style.

I taste fruit, almonds, burnt carmel and a small hint of heat. Very complex, I think I'll need to revist this one to nail it down better, but it's a tasty one, for sure.

The mouth feel has a nice complexity to it, but i'm not partial to the dry finish.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,FloridaDrinker,3.7,"Poured a hazy orange with a robust head. Smell of citrus fruit, malt and sage.. The taste is intensely bitter, lemon, sage with a slight metallic element in the finish. It is surprisingly refreshing.  Orval is a very unique beer, from the bottle to the flavor - there's nothing quite like it. That said, as finely crafted an ale as it is, it's not for everyone. It's my least favorite of the trappist ales.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,saintwarrick,4.38,"My fourth Belgian Trappist brewery down, two to go. Pours an orangey gold, hazy with nice carbonation that keeps a great head on the beer. Aroma is champagne, berries, lemons and other fruit, but not quite as overwhelming as some other Belgian brews. Taste is citrusy and hoppy bitter, with a nice hop bite as it goes down and nice dry finish like an American pale ale.  At 6.2 percent, easily the weakest (by alcohol) and drinkable of the Trappist brews I have had thus far. Another world-class brew.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Lothore,4.48,"A- Pours an Orangey Caramel Color with a massive head. Head has great body and excellent retention. Overall a beautiful brew.  S- The smell is faint however there are distinctive sweet flowery notes and a muted doughy smell. I detected a slight metallic tinge.  T- Starts off sweet and doughy and progresses to a slightly bitter taste. This finishes very smooth with no lingering flavors left on the palate. Exceptional blend of juniper and sweet doughy flavors.  M- Very smooth, a robust carbonation as well as a full body.  D- Highly drinkable. This beer finishes so smooth that it leaves me wanting more and more. Exceptional mix of flavors that is not overpowering. I could certainly enjoy a few of these in an evening if it was not for the lofty price tag.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Nesued,4.72,"Appearance - Orange hazy color. A big white head forms upon pour. Fine carbonation feeds this head that resolves to a one-finger presence that remains throughout consumption.  Smell - What a pleasure. Flowery, lemon aroma. Some have said juniper, after having to pause and think about the aroma of juniper, I'll have to agree yes! Very light-hearted aroma with a bright clean presence.  Taste - First word from my mouth: crisp. The carbonation makes it's appearance during the ""hold"" on the palate. I did notice a light smokey body form towards the end of the sip. Nice crisp and clean finish with a bit of a bite ending.  Mouthfeel - Very mouth-filling. The carbonation transports the bulk of the body around the mouth to make for a very full feel. After the swallow, you are left with a clean slate waiting for more.  Drinkability - This was plain and simple a joy to drink. An outstanding depth and crisp finish may this a wonderful ""no nonsense"" offering. As the last of the trappists for me to try, this indeed holds a place in the pantheon on great beers. One of my top 20 all time.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,jmalex,3.98,"Checking off my second of the six Trappists. I've been waiting to pull this out of the fridge for a long time now.  APPEARANCE: Pours into my Trois Pistoles goblet a hazy yet translucent dark amber with significant red hues to it. It has the most amazing head I think I've ever seen. It's one finger high and simply will not budge. Marvelous!  SMELL: Big immediate aroma of the bready funk that you'd expect. Sniffing deeper, one can discern some fruity peach smells and a peppery spiciness.  TASTE: ""Oh yeah!"", I said aloud after my first sip. The peppery spice jumps right out at you as you first drink and bitters slightly from a taste of raw hops. It briefly becomes malty sweet before quickly morphing to bready and light. It finishes very clean, leaving just a trace bitterness in your mouth. A fine beer, for sure!  MOUTHFEEL: The carbonation is great. It's very effervescent and works to enhance the flavors. The body is a bit light and borders on watery toward the finish.  DRINKABILITY: I didn't expect a Trappist beer to have such a ""relatively"" low ABV like this one does. It's really a great beer to spend an evening drinking.  The monks can do no wrong. At least that's what Orval has led me to believe. It will certainly be returning to my fridge in the very near future.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

T - Along the same lines as the smell but with a earthy, dry grass sort of flavour thrown in. M - Quite a full mouthfeel, medium carbonation. A pretty dry finish.

37,129,John_M,3.51,"Had not had this beer in some time and now I recall why I've never been a big fan. I'll be sure not to make the mistake of ordering this one again. Nothing wrong with it, but with so many other outstanding Belgium's out there, no reason to buy this one again.  The beer pours a brownish orange color. There is some head retention, but almost no lacing to speak of. On the nose I get very little, maybe a hint of lemon... not really sure. There just isn't much there. On the palate the beer is very tart and very dry at the same time. I guess this beer is trying to be some type of Belgium pale ale, but it really doesn't work for me. The beer tastes fairly light for a Belgium, and I guess with the abv. you could probably drink a few of these, were price not an obstacle. The mouthfeel is OK, and the beer comes across as fairly refreshing. The finish is rather short and crisp, but there are no off flavors.  An OK beer, but nothing special. I more then likely will not be ordering this again any time soon.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Great color, wonderful head, visible carbonation, and a swirling yeasty presence that reminded me of The Fog. Smell is simple, and sweet. A touch of watermelon and fine malt. Taste is conservative compared to some of the more over-the-top offerings found in the motherland, but refined and delicious. Subdued esters and a nice hop presence. Mouthfeel is perfect, leathery and substantial while maintaining is soft side. Leather and lace. I just realized that aside from the formidable price tag that would be involved, this is a session Trappist.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,sessycuban,4.52,"A - To say this beer had a lot of head would be an understatement. I gave it a good 10 minutes to settle down before I actually got to the beer. Despite this, I was impressed by how well the beer retained the head as well as the lacing.  S - The smells are quite complex, so much so that it's hard to identify the different smells. While I'm not always a fan of this, I think it works with this beer. I had a long time to smell this after having to wait for the head to settle.  T - The taste is as complex as the smell. Like other trappist ales, I get a citrus flavor at the end. Lots of fruits are present, while still maintaining the hop flavor.  M - Once you actually get the head to settle, this beer feels great in your mouth. It's very rich in tone.  D - This is a great beer. My only problem was finding a suitable pairing for it. I think if you match this beer with the wrong food, you're going to lose out on a lot of the subtleties of the flavors and aromas more so than your average beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Bright light amber color. Lots of carbonation bubbling up.  S: Smells of Belgian funk and fruit, can't tell what kind of fruit though. I like it.  T: Tastes mildly funky and fruity up front with a bit of hops in the finish. Funk is not overpowering but blends nicely with the other flavors. Very nice.  M: Effervescent, medium body, lingering bitter funk on the back of the tongue.  D: I'd say it's quite drinkable. Tastes very good and is pretty easy drinking. I could drink a few of these if I could afford it.  I'd like to try some fresh Orval sometime. I've read that they add the Brettanomyces at bottling so it's hoppier and less funky fresh and the Brett becomes stronger over time. The brewer said he likes it fresh.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,objectivemonkey,4.01,"Bottled 30-6-05, best by 30-6-10, the slightly portly bottle a classic. Into a chalice, pours a lovely golden hue, lightening around the edges, with a bubbly inch of head to start with. After receding to a thick film, the head is brought back with a modest swirl, and lacing falls in sheets. The aroma, though not very assertive, pulls one into the beer, the hops take on a grassy feel, spice, and noble, fruity and floral but coaxing all the way to put it to mouth. And then it doesn't disappoint. There are spices aplenty, pairing well with the lemon, grassy, citric hops, loads of bittering involved, and are only magnified by the crazy carbonation. The body is deceivingly light, not so much for malts around here, but very refreshing, and the dry finish leaves you craving for either more Orval or more cheese (which I'm eating with it). In sum, while not my favorite Belgian, nor my favorite Trappist, Orval is a hands down classic and definitely worth enjoying every so often.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Smell is slight hops, citrus...Some funk? Nice! The taste is hard for me to pin down. The hops stand out, but not bitter or overly tart. The funk is there, but stripped down. Not picking up as much citrus as I noticed in the smell. Some white pepper maybe. I like this a lot, and one bottle is not enough. Mouthfeel is full and prickly with carbonation. Drinkability is great. I really need a bomber of this. Does it come in bombers? A repeat buy for sure.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,eberkman,3.71,"Poured a hazy honey-colored orange-amber with a billowing, rocky white head that retained well. Bottle foamed a lot upon opening, which also made for a very foamy pour.  Not a particularly strong smell - some tart citrus notes.  The taste is pretty similar -- mostly sour citrus, some spice and a nice hoppy bite with a real dry sourness in the finish. Certainly complex.  Good crisp, carbonated mouthfeel. And pretty drinkable at 6.20 ABV without any sort of cloying sweetness.  A good, authentic Trappist beer. Certainly not one of my favorites, but worth trying.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,bluejacket74,4.25,"11.2 ounce bottle, label says bottled on 17/07/2014, best before 17/07/2019. Served in an Orval chalice, the beer pours a hazy orange/amber color with about an inch and a half frothy off-white head that stayed around for a really long time. There's also a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like citrus peel, apple, white grapes, banana, peppery spice and some earthiness. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some grassiness and pear noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is medium and is well carbonated. But the carbonation is soft, and doesn't hurt this brew at all. It's easy and enjoyable to drink. I have to say I like Orval more now than I did when I first tried and reviewed this in 2007. I really do need to buy this more often!  Review from 4/13/2007:  look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5  11.2 ounce bottle, bottled on 1/24/06, best before 1/24/2011. Served in a snifter, the beer pours an orange/copper color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. It smells fruity(lemon, orange, plum and banana), spicy (peppery and herbal/earthy) and malty. There's also other smells that I can't tell exactly what they are. The taste is pretty much like the smell but the citrus taste is the strongest. There's so much to this beer it's pretty hard to figure it all out, if that makes sense at all. Mouthfeel is light/medium, but it has a bit too much carbonation for my liking. Drinkability is decent, but if the carbonation was cut down a bit, it would be much better. Overall, I'd still drink this again, it's pretty good.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Deliciously cloudy body and outstanding head, can you tell I am impressed yet!  S - An explosion of aromas hit when the glass is raised to the nose. Fruity and spicy with seemingly sweetness underneath. So complex that difficuly to isolate individual smells.  T - Pretty much in line with the smell, complex. Citrus fruits with hops in the finish, slightly sour.  M - Lovely natural carbonation.  D - Really enjoyed this but the style is intense and having more than one at a time seems almost disrespectful.  Fairly stunning brew that really makes a big impression.

The foam exploded out of the bottle after I popped the cap.  S: Some light fruit (lemon & orange) along with some floral accents.  T: A very complex taste. The light fruit is followed by some spices and herbal flavors. Honestly, there are all sorts of interesting flavors in this beer and it's difficult to pin down exactly what they are. Some of them are very grassy and earthy. More hops than other Belgian pale ales that I've had gives it a hoppy bite at the end.  M: It has a light body and is very crisp and finishes dry.  D: An extremely unique, interesting and complex beer. It's definitely something that I'll have again but will likely not be in regular rotation. The complex taste makes this a nice sipping beer but I couldn't see having more than 1 or 2.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,emerge077,4.43,"Into an oversized tulip, this ale forms a huge, merengue-like head of foam. The foam is irregular with some bigger bubbles in it, and ivory-white. Tawny orange color.  A whiff of Brett is present, noticeable from a distance, though it subsides a bit over time.  A hint of dry cinnamon in the finish, and smooth carbonation that creates a luxurious & prickly mouthfeel. Moderate funk from the Brett and yeast. Not overly wild, but certainly a unique strain. Dry finish, hints at sweetness. Tea, spice, aged hops, raw honey, the list goes on. Taste builds and develops over time.  I've always enjoyed reading reviews describing a ""basement with cobwebs"" and this one just might live up to that description. On my list of top Belgians.  Cellar notes 11/2007: Side by side...2007 bottle aged 6 mos., 2005 bottle aged 2 yrs.  2007: Served at 55º. Fruity aroma, damp cobblestone (minerals), hay. Dry finish, hint of bubblegum and sterile gauze from the Brett. Slight tartness and bitterness of hops. Charged streamers of carbonation through slightly hazy orange. Reminds me alot of JP Bam Biére.  2005: Dramatically billowing foam, still very charged after 2 yrs. Very high clarity jewel-tone orange. Aroma has a slightly sweeter fruit aroma, no more or less intense than the fresher sample. ""Cleaner"" smell too, not especially funky or barnyard. Some mild sharpness though, more closey related to alcohol. A more subdued tartness. Carbonation is more mellow and much less prickly. Honey aftertaste.  Overall, i'm not sure that extended aging (2 yrs.) benefits or hinders Orval. It's slightly different, but not enough to strongly recommend aging for longer periods.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Smell: Aroma is a bit herbal and spicy. Light overall; hard to distinguish anything in particular.  Taste: Unique and refreshing spicy/herbal flavor. I'm really having a tough time identifying any of the elements, though there is some yeast. A bit of bitterness towards the end, followed by some alcohol in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Light- to medium-bodied, but quite viscous. Very smooth, and with quite a bit of soft carbonation.  Drinkability: ABV is fine, but there is a bit of alcohol in the flavor. And the unusual taste can get a bit overwhelming at times.  Though unique, interesting, and one of the better Belgian pale ales I've had, I still can't quite get into it.

Smell: lots of citrus really hits me here, especially lime, with some fresh grass and a slight manure-esque hint. note* as the beer warms this manure flavour transforms into something resembling a cognac  Taste: Very limey citrus taste up front. This develops quickly into a more sweeter flavour and slightly sticky texture, however finishes very dry and pilsner-like. The lime is always there, but notes of a spice such as nutmeg, coriander maybe, come through to give a sweetness aswell.  M- very spritzy and highly carbonated, firm body, no watery aftertaste here.  D- I dont think i could drink more than 2, the citrus flavours really make this a sipper for me, and not something i could go a session on.

The head is a fluffy creamy biege coloration. The head has major retention. Thick sheets of lacing remain on my glass.  Smell: The beer has a very pleasing clove and citrus combo. This combines very well with a vaguely sour fruityness and peppery corriander. Herbal floral notes complement the beers smell.  Taste: The beer has a sour citrus taste to begin with. The beer then goes peppery and bret yeasty. The beer has a not unpleasant mineral flavor at the back of the taste. The beer stays fairly dry throughout the session.   Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a dry mouthfeel from start to finish. The beer is very carbonated but is never becomes stinging. The body seems to be on the lighter side.

Slightly hazy honey hue with an off white thick bubbly head that slowly settles to a thin cap, leaving plenty of lacing behind. The lacing continues to build with each sip.  Light pale malts along with a distinctive spicy aroma that I haven't smelled in other Belgian Pale Ales.  Cracker like malts are the dominant characteristic, with very few of the estery characteristics normally found. A creaminess sneaks in behind the light spice. Mild fruit flavors are spread across the entire experience. The finish is grainy with a little spice.  The first time I had this brew it seemed like I was drinking battery acid. The bottle must have been infected or poorly handled. This time around it was a much better experience. This BPA is a little more malt oriented than others, with esters being only a light addition to the background. The fruity esters are kicked up a notch with the addition of the yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle. Recommended.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,ccrida,4.73,"Poured in my vintage Westmalle chalice, Orval is a hazy golden orange with a thick, rocky, white head with medium bubbles that is very slow to recede, leaving moderate lace. The aroma is moderate, musty yet bright, earthy flowers and yeast, distinctly belgian and very appetizing. The taste really nice, incredible depth yet fairly subtle. It is beyond my ability to break it down to specifically, but theres a bit of sourness, salt, yeast (which I swirled off the bottom), leathery, bitterness, straw, only the slightest sweet pale and caramel malts, minerals, bread, honey and flowers, and probably more stuff that I just can't break down. The finish is very bitter dry and clean, but for a nice pucker on the tongue. There is a slight bit of alcohol as the beer warms, but it is clean and good, no solvents or anything. I love any beer with brett, and this is as fine as example as there is - it's tough too beat Gout d'Oraval. I normally prefer more robust flavors, but the subtly here speaks volumes. The mouthfeel is pretty spritzy and light bodied, very nice and really opens this beer up. Being that it was bottled 15 months ago says alot. The drinkability for this is as high as it gets (aside from perhaps the cost). The taste is great without being overwhelming, and complex enough that it will take me a lifetime to figure out.

S- Pleasantly fruity nose. Spicy, too. Clove is quite evident, along with some alcohol and perhaps a touch of barnyard-like funkiness.  T- Hmm, interesting. I don't really know how to describe the taste. It's fairly mild. It's kind of sweet at first, but it quickly dries out until there is little to no sweetness on the finish. Yeast contributes to some interesting flavors, although I'm finding it tough to pick anything out. Definite notes of spice, some pepper and clove. Some lemon juice sourness in the middle and a cracker-like maltiness on the finish. It's also relatively bitter.  M- Lots of carbonation, but it suits this beer well. No complaints.  D- For some reason I can't see myself drinking a lot of this. All evidence seems to point to this being a very drinkable beer (medium-light body, good carbonation, dry finish) but I really wouldn't want to drink a ton of it. Also, the ABV is kind of high (my bottle says 6.9%), although not too bad. I might have another, but certainly not more than two.  Well, this was definitely an interesting beer. It's also a bit of an enigma, as I can't seem to pinpoint any definite taste characteristics. I know that Brett is used at some point in the making of this beer, so maybe that's throwing my tastes off. Anyway, it's certainly not bad and actually pretty good, but will be a rare purchase for me in the future.

This looks great in a Duvel tulip.  S- There is a lot to the smell here- some sourness, lighter fruit, lemon, pepper. Vinegar.  T- A lot of olive, vinegar, fruit, bready. I get a little bit of snow flavor too- I can't think of any other way to put it. Again with the lemon and pepper. What is up with the olive?  M- Pretty light on the palate due to the massive amount of carbonation. It is also pretty dry on the palate.  D- This is pretty different for a trappist beer. Not really what I was expecting, but I am glad I tried it.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,bjohnson,3.53,"A: Pours a murky rusty straw color with a puffy marshmellow like cream colored head. Nice retention. Sticky lacing. S: Spicy with lemon zest and orange rind. Tangy aromas also. Fresh with floral notes. T/M: Lemon zest, orange peel, spices, and a grassy hop presence. Flower petal aroma a bold flavor that's present. Almost champagne like carbonation that's spritzy on the tongue. Bready wheat notes hang on the palate well into the finish. Tarty fruit sweetness hangs into the aftertaste from the initial introduction. Also a tad sour. Dry finish. A bit thin imo. D: Not bad, but not one I'd go out of my way for, especially considering the price. it just didn't do it for me.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,slyke,4.23,Orval pours a hazy amber with a very large (four fingers) rocky white head from its 11.2 ounce bottle. The aroma is medicinal with notes of licorice. The taste is also medicinal in nature with notes of licorice and yeast. Mouthfeel is very good filling the mouth with a snappy finish. Drinkability is good. This beer is a pretty good sipper. Recommended.,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Hammarby,4.5,"A: Cloudy amber with an enormous tan head. Head is foamy with quite large bubbles, stays forever and laces. S: Grapefruit, peares, yeast, lilac, leather, amonia. Big nose, very complex. Smells like a nice bourgogne. T: Lilac (translated from the aroma), grapefruit, grapes, some malt, bitterness. Winelike qualities when it comes to complexity. Aftertaste of honey and eucalyptus. Alcohol not at all dominant. M: Moderately carbonated, light to medium body, but the lightness is balanced by the extraordinary complexity.  Outstanding. Not for beginners.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,ojiikun,3.94,"Served in an oversized wineglass. Upon popping the cap, the beer nearly shot out, despite having just rested in my beer fridge for almost a month. Go figure. Pours very dark for the style, almost an orange. Very cloudy, but no particles to be seen. Head is loose around the edges but thick and creamy in the middle. Outrageously long lasting, but with no lace at all.  Smell is delectable - spicy but strong malt, cherry, sweet asringency, fresh yeast, no bad belgian funk, lots of beet candi.  Taste was more dry than expected and incredibly light - powdered sugar, lemon zest, sweet Indian spice, bubblegum. Totally different than what the nose suggested.  Mouthfeel is smooth and well-carbonated, though a little bit astringent and drying. With so little body to chew on, this one can really clean you out.  Even near the end when warming a good deal, the flavours locked in this beer stay just there - inside. With no body to ride on, it's hard to really taste much of anything. That said, I could sit and sniff this one all day. Smells absolutely brilliant.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,rec,2.97,"An explosive light white frothy creates an almost three-finger head. It laces exceptionally well throughout the consumption of this rich copper ale.  The smell is almost non-existent, but when an effort is made, clove and nuts are apparent. Clove also comes through in the taste, alongside pear and very mild spice. The aftertaste is a dry yet sour yeast.  It's generally quite a bland tasting beer in my opinion, and paired with its overcarbonation isn't really one I'd be keen to enter a session with, but is definately something to try.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,brdc,3.68,"Interesting. This one was bought in Minnesotta, and it has the exact same manufacturing date of the previous review, presumably bought in California. I did not know their production was this big. Anyway, beautiful murky reddish-brown beer with a foamy white head. Smell is more delicate than I expected, with hops and malts, sugar and molasses. Heavy mouthfeel, and a surprising taste for a trappist beer: it has the usual heavy malts, warming alcohol, but also has a bitter, cleansing hoppy finish. There are a lot more hops here than Chimay, Rochefort, Westmalle or Achel. Not my favorite trappist, but still an interesting brew.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,KingG,4.38,"First time i had this brew it was served too cold to enjoy. This time i'm gonna try it at room temp. Bottled on - 04-04-2006 Best Before - 04-04-2011  Appearance is exceptional. Huge spiderweb-like head appears and doesn't die. looks liek a foam eruption in my glass. Lace coats the inside of the glass like a DIPA. Color of the beer is copper. Huge stream of carbonated bubbles shoot upward toward the head. Lovely.  Smell is very good. Clove, hops and a small amount of nutty, malty goodness hits the nose. Very unique fragrance.  Taste is good. Much like the nose but surprisingly milder. Clove, hops and light fruit (pear?) are the main flavors. Nice.  Mouthfeel is good. Slightly over-carbonated but enjoyable. Very lively in the mouth. Slick going down. Little less carbonation would have given it a higher score but by no means bad.  Drinkability is exceptional. I could drink this all day. Quite easy to put down.  Overall: A very nice Trappist ale that is unique and enjoyable. Orval must be consumed at cellar or room temp to be fully appreciated though. Highly recommended.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,stereosforgeeks,4.42,Appearance: Wow what head on this one! It just never left. Talk about lacing as well. The beer itself pours a light to medium brown with some cloudiness.  Smell: I smell spices and a bit of banana and apples.  Taste: Taste those fruit and spices! It has a very bready yeast but still manages to contain a nice tartness that continues into the mouthfeel. There is a subtle hop taste but it's masked by the fruits.  Mouthfeel: Rather thin and acidic but with lasting flavors that just continue to develop.  Drinkability: This beer is definitely an acquired taste but it's incredibly drinkable if you like it. I definitely could go for a couple more of these at the moment.,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,kajerm,3.73,"bottle from the local (awesome) grocery store, I wish Merchant du Vin wouldn't relabel their beers. label says the beer was bottled on 8/29/2006.  poured into a wine glass with a monster white head that didn't lace so much as clung to the walls for dear life. it hangs around forever and stands up pretty well. the beer is a beautiful opaque light brown, with a color gradient around the edges-- between the color and that sweet head, this is a nice beer to look at.  smells like... brett. loads and loads of brett, but there's a paradox here-- there's nothing but brett to be found (at least by me), but it has enough subtlety to smell very nice. there's a kind of appleish aroma hiding behind it, but gueuze always smelled a little like apple cider to me too.  the flavor is a little belgian yeast, a drop of malt,and mounds of bretty tanginess and funk. the sourness is pleasant, and bretty as this beer is, it doesn't have the nasty taste of infected beer-- maybe because the ""infection"" has nothing to compete with? in any case, I like it.  and it feels so good to drink. sour as it is, the high carbonation, the crispness, and the weight of the yeast come together for a great mouthfeel.  drinkability? depends on how much of a weirdo you are. with a suitable pairing for the sourness (maybe a dessert), I could put away a few of these, but there's only so much brettanomyces that one human being can take. it seems to stand up pretty well to spicy food as well.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,BlindPig,3.22,A- Huge off white head on a cloudy dark orange body. Good head retention and leaves thick lacing. S- Sour tart apples. Faint stale aroma. Light wood also comes through. T- Light sour apple flavor. Not near as much as the smell hints at. Light bitterness. As soon as you swallow it is almost a soap flavor. Light yeast. Some sour fruits come out. Very different taste. Not sure if this bottle is skunked since it was bottled in 2004 and it was just left on the shelf in the store and light is usually on it. M- High carbonation on a thin body. D- It is kind of weird. Not to fond of it. To much carbonation. The only thing that I really like about it is the aroma.,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,vancurly,4.27,"Drank this at the Heritage Belgian Beer cafe in Sydney.  Pours a hazy dark burnt orange, head fades, but good lace.  Light aromas of sour fruit. Some oakiness & gamey off-notes. Complex & intriguing.  Flavours of leather, medicine/band-aids. Slight barnyard character, perfumy, with a late cherrywood aftertaste.  Some bitterness, and astringency. The mouthfeel is very dry, almost dusty. Highly attenuated... thin, no sweetness.  For me, this is truly the Burgundy of beers. Wild, gamey, dry, tannic, fleshy.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Metalmonk,4.57,"My first taste of Orval was summer 2005, and I thought it was really bizarre stuff, something my wife called ""sweaty socks"". Its strange flavor lead me to search for opinions online, and lo and behold there was this website called Beer Advocate. After a bit I started to acquire a taste for Brett-ified beers (especially via the great Flemish Primitive). A trip to the actual abbey and a couple fresh ones later, I am converted. No matter what you think of Orval, it remains one of a kind.  This bottled was brewed on June 24, 2005. A year-and-a-half age on it. Produces a healthy ""zissss!"" when the cap pops, so carbonation is still high. Poured one of the most dense and beautiful heads I've ever seen on a beer. Wowza. Looks almost like gooey mozzarella. The bubbles are abundant, and the head sticks around forever. The color is a rusty copper color. Very very nice.  A quick sniff gives off grassy, herbal aromas, also some honey and banana...a longer whiff brings in that ""horse-blanket"" Brett mania that makes this such a love-or-hate beer. An incredibly unique aroma that I cannot stop inhaling. (We have two horses, and we have two horse-blankets, so I can say with confidence that this indeed does resemble the smell of horse-blanket!)  First sip brings in fresh-baked wheat bread, banana, something somewhere between clove and nutmeg...and there it is again, that wacky ""armpit"" aroma (once again, my wife's words). I'd describe it more like leather, maybe really yeasty bread. The dry finish offers a bit more funk, but twisted in a different way, and you get a feel for the hops at this stage. There are indeed some hops here, but they're extremely well-incorporated. Freshly mown grass also comes to mind throughout.  Mouthfeel is full and round, while also buoyant and light. Not at all thick. Clearly there's a good bit of carbonation (the undying head is proof of that), but it's not overly sharp.  This isn't the biggest, baddest, boldest, or even most extreme beer, but it satisfies in some of the same ways as those kinds of beers, yet it also works well with various foods and for quiet, contemplative sipping sessions. A textbook-definition ""Acquired Taste"" beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,theformula,4.28,"The ratings are high, and for good reason. When I'm so used to the traditional English and American Pale Ale, this adds a brilliant complexity to the style. And it's my first taste of Orval.  Great looking beer, light amber color. The head just grew and grew to a billow-y, fluffy cloud that doesn't every dissapear. Nice lacing throughout.  Mouthfeel is light, with a bite of carbonation and almost a fine, powder-y texture on the roof of the mouth.  Smells of hops, clove, green banana/fruit, sugar and a little phenolic goodness to make things interesting. Fruit and flowers.  Tastes much hoppier than the aroma lets on. Delicious hop bitterness is subtle, along with ""that"" yeast strain and some citrus that gives it a tart bite. Sugar cane, wet hay and light honey give this so much complexity.  This is the best pale ale I've had the pleasure to taste, and drinkability is way up there b/c of the bone-dry finish. It's thin, but I guess it's accurate for the style. Awesome.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,GbVDave,3.68,"Poured from an 11.2oz bottle into a Chimay chalice.  A: Pours a hazy dark amber. Amazing head. The three finger head receded from the sides of the glass long before the center. What I was left with was a foam ""volcano"" complete with sloped mountainsides and a crater in the center. Eventually the volcano also receded and left me with looked like a gigantic Cheerio in the center of the glass. Very cool! Active carbonation and massive lacing.  S: I detected aromas of Brett, spice, wet dirt, and hops.  T: Take everything from above and add in a unique fruit tartness. As it warms, a thin maltiness emerges. Unfortunately the hop flavors are rather subdued. Interesting tang to the finish.  M: Thin and acidic. True to the style, I guess, but I've had BPA's that have had a much fuller mouthfeel than this.  D: Drinkability is decent. To me, this is a beer that is crying out for more hops. The flavors and aromas are pleasant enough, but it's just missing something.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Absumaster,3.83,"This beer is a classic, but for some reason I have never reviewed it before.  Appearance is a murky orange beer with a big, rocky head that lasts throughout the beer.  Smell is very interesting with the Bretta and dryhopped smell. There is also something what I would call cork and it has a slightly sour smell.  Taste of Bretta and a slightly sharp acidity, which is a bit too sharp for me and it also has a medicinal taste. The typical Orval yeast is a strange animal that seems to be behave differently every time and over time. The hops quickly overrule the sharp taste and give the beer a nice (dry)hoppy taste that is resinous and spicy. Body is quite thin, but in style.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,zuccard,4.2,"Loved this one...Tremendous head on this beer...great color, slightly amber in color, very frothy and hung in there throughout the entire bottle.  Taste was nice, fruity, with a bit of an almost smoky aftertaste. Color was a hazy orange. With %alc at 6.9, the mouthfeel and apparent alcohol was very well done. Did not seem that high, and no solvent-like taste.  Just a great beer. Loved it and will go back for more",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,jeffaz02t,5,"A: Pours a great dark-gold color. The head is beautiful.So thick and creamy. It was 3 inches, but it kept growing from the middle. Very cool looking. Aside from the look of the actual beer, the bowling pin style bottle is the coolest bottle I have ever seen! I do not know why but I really like the actual bottle!  S: Cloves, spices, some yeast as well. There is also a hops scent that I have never really smelled before... Actually pretty nice scent. I cannot wait for the head to go down a little more so I can drink this brew. My mouth is watering from the smell of this beer.  T: Hint of spice, nothing over the top. I taste some very tasty yeast in this brew. Very unique hops flavor; again I have not experienced a taste like this from hops. VERY tasty brew.  M: I want to say the mouthfeel seems oily (this is not a bad thing) . This beer rocks.  D: I am glad I picked up a few cases of this. I would have trouble rationing just a few bottles. What a great, drinkable beer!!! My fav. of all time... Very distinct from other beers. This, in my opinion, is the greatest beer in the world!",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,bigreduw64,3.86,Poured a dark gold color with a very nice head. At first had a light flavor with a taste of a slight banana yeast flavor. It had a moderate finish that hung around in my mouth for about 20 seconds.

37,129,roblowther,4.2,"Looks great, in short. Golden in color, seems to glow when you hold it up to the light. The head is dense and creamy, with bubbles too small to see in places. Smell is sweet but with a bitter note in the background and something like cloves. Tastes peppery at first, but that quickly mellows to reveal the malt. That, in turn, yields to the dry, slightly acidic finish that is a very crisp, refreshing combination indeed. I suspect that aging would only benefit this one, though I've never tried it. Mouthfeel is very good, silky and oily, which makes a nice contrast to the crisp flavor finish. Drinkability is good but the dryness of the aftertaste usually means I only have one of these in a session. I haven't had another beer like this, its really a great, unique experience. Pair it with (as you can at the cafe nearby) a ham, potato, and cheese stew, cooked in the beer, and you've really got something!",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,Phatz,4.13,"Served in my snifter glass.  Appearance: Pours a slightly hazed orange gold with a huge rocky off white head and notable lacing  Smelly: Spicy suggestion of lemon and orange rind mildly grace the nose and offset a sweet sprinkle of brown sugar while a solid yeast attribute rises out of the bready bosom of the beer.  Taste: The taste also displays a sweet and sour counter-play. I tasted this beer with the yeast out after a careful pour. Half way through I added the yeast back in and I'll tell you it improved in depth with the yeast in this one. I usually leave it in a BSDA and out of a BSPA but not so in this case. Most of the interesting flavors including the apples and vanilla and the banana phenols even more spices came in (or greater w/) the yeast. It has a chewy jolly rancher flavor and a big pleasant bite from the dryness in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: It is consistent in its prickliness (from dry spices and pepper) so it gives the illusion of smooth.  Drinkability: I must admit I did have high expectations for this beer and it did fall a bit short of my hopes, but it was quite drinkable but at $6 a bottle I'm not all that trilled about serving it as a party beer. Worth tasting yeah but Belgium has more to offer IMO.  Hope this is helpful. Cheers!",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,CWiggins,3.11,"I really forward to trying this beer. It's one of the few available Belgian ales I've not tried, and so I purchased a bottle at the EarthFare in Raleigh while there this evening.  It poured a dark gold in my Dogfish Head snifter. A huge head formed; it was nearly snow-white and lasted until the beer was completely consumed. The smell was very full and nice; there were clear aromas of malts and hops, and a distinct floral hint as well.  The flavor was a bit disappointing. This is probably due to the fact that I'm so used to sweet, full-flavored Belgian ales, and this one just doesn't attempt that. Instead, there is a strong floral flavor on the front end, followed by a nutty breadiness at the finish. The mouthfeel is good. There's a full-mouthed, sticky feel to this beer. It has the right idea!  It probably needs another chance. I'll try this again at a later date.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,drseamus,3.45,"The bottle I got was bottled on 1/31/06 and I drank it on 12/27/06, so it was about 11 months old. I poured this beer into a Chimay glass and it fit perfectly. The beer was a slightly cloudy amber color and the near white creamy head filled the rest of the glass. As with most belgians, the head stuck around for a while and slowly fell unevenly leaving nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is sour smelling, which matches the taste. There isn't enough sweetness to entirely balance the sour as in some other beers I've tried, but the sour flavor isn't bad either. It is fairly smooth for the sourness. Overall, I'm not crazy about this beer, but I would probably drink it again if it was aged more.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,stevecee2003,2.52,"APP - Huge head! At least half the glass, maybe more. Light merky amber color.  SMELL - Wow, just take in all those smells. Soft malts. and lemon. Some kind of flowers. Very nice. I have hopes!  TASTE - A bit of a disappointment. Although I must admit I didn't know what to expect, so what's to disappoint? Well, I expected more from a Trappist Ale. It was crisp- yet watered down. There is also that unmistakable lemon in there, and now that I taste it, maybe thats not a good thing. At least for me.  MOUTH - It just feels very watery. I admit I most enjoy strong IPA's, so perhaps this disqualifies me. But this goes down TOO easily. Almost like, and I hate to say it, a Budweiser. Oooohh. Sorry.  DRINKABILITY - Probably good for some as it goes down easily.  NOTES - It may be good for some. If so, go for it! But for me- I am glad I tried it, but no. No.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Gmann,3.91,"Poured a cloudy dirty orange brown color with a fantastic off-white head, some lacing but not much. I get a bit of a bubble gum aroma, though I am not sure if that should be accurate. It has a well balanced taste between the malt and hops. This is a Belgian that I can actually detect the hops. The mouthfeel is fizzy and a bit dry. This one took me a while to figure out. The flavor doesn't stand out right away like most Belgians but becomes a bit more pronounced as it warms. A very good pale ale, though not as spicy as other Belgian pale ales, more hoppy. Very drinkable.  Review dated 1/4/08, bottled 7/11/06  The head was equally as huge as my first review but this time it left tons of lace. Along with the phenol and grass/hop smell I also pick up some lemon and tart apple. The taste is quite earthy and has a funky sourness to it. Apples and lemon are predominiate with some medicinal flavors as well. The carbonation seems smoother on this sample. Definitely a different Belgian brew which seems to change with age.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

It poured a cloudy light brown/tan color with a decent head and some lacing. Even though I poured carefully, yeast was noticeable floating in large clumps. The smell was floral and slightly spicy - very inviting. Where this beer took a downturn was the taste. It was bitter and floral, almost tasted like drinking potpourri. The mouth feel was thin and left a bitter coat on the tongue.

Off-white three finger head that slowly fades to a fluffy mass on top of this beauty. Very nice lacing on my DFH snifter. I bet this looks even better in the Orval chalice.  Smell: Brett, slight funk, and nice hops followed by oranges and more hops. Even a touch of tropical fruits. Man, I forgot how good the aroma was on this.  Taste: Nice balanced taste of hops and malt. Rustic brett like flavors come through paving the way to slight tropical fruit and orange notes in the finish. Quite smooth.  Mouthfeel: Slight hops hit the tongue from the start. Brett and slight tartness covered the roof of my mouth for a bit.  Drinkability: This is a very drinkable beer. If this were cheaper, this would be one of my normal session beers.  Haven't had this in a few years. It won't be another few years before I have another one. This is a nice transition beer for newer ""beer"" drinkers either to IPA's, wild ales, or other belgians. I recommend trying this to anyone. Haven't had too many beers quite like this.

At first it tastes very fruity, with distinct colors of apples, cider, and other fuits as well as a twinge of cinnamon. A very interesting after taste lingered after the first sip. The head eventually dissolved into a 1 finger constant, with lacing down the side of the glass. The beer is just carbonated enough, and not too overly done.

Rocky and fluffy, almost cloud like...and the lacing is nice too. The head just doesn't completely go away! Amberish opaque color...Smell of light alcohol and apples and various spices and a mild hop aroma...somewhat reminiscent of a champagne? The taste is well balanced and subtle...I still can't put my finger on what exactly I should compare it to (apple/raspberry/boysenberry/pear?). The hops are nice and don't dominate but they stick with you to the bitter end (sorry for the pun). Anyways, this beer is light bodied with very subtle carbonation.

Apple cider, honey, citrus in the nose. Very appealing.  Cider flavor, with nice hop kick. Tastes crisp, slightly tart, with a very floral finish. Lots going on in this one, but it manages to be well-balanced.  Good carbonation, nice creamy oily texture. Long dry bitter finish. Feels sturdy.

If I did, it was towards the end of the session, and I actually went out after 40+ samples and kept drinking at a bar, then another bar, and then a house party, so let's just say that this was my first time, mmk?  I really, really, really, wanted to like this beer. The no-nonsense label, the erotic bottle, and the fluffiest head I have ever seen. Pours with just the tiniest bit of yeast in suspension. So inviting, but then I actually give it a taste.  All I can say is that there is an earthiness to this beer that obtains and maintains the focal point throughout the quaff. I started drinking it cold, out of that ommegang flute with the silly scribbled guy on it. That nagging taste was there. I finished drinking it just above cellar temperature.. no change.  There was just something eminently one-dimensional about this beer. I could only taste that one thing, and it wasn't a fresh spiciness or 'complex malt character' or anything like that. It was just, well.. boring, and almost incomparable to anything else. First and possibly last tasting for this beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,dedrinker,4.26,"Bottled April ' 06, drank Dec.' 06  Strong burst of carbonation on opening bottle. First pour gushes and foams, I wait and pour the rest in one smooth motion. Dense, rocky, off-white creamy head looks too beautiful. I dont want to drink it - just look at it. Light mahogany color with orange highlights. Aroma of sherbert and damp earth near the stables. Phenolic aromas and flavors of holiday spices and juicy fruit gum. Not very sweet though, with a little sour tang. 15 minutes later and halfway through the beer the head has finally settled down to a thin, soft blanket of melted marshmallow with persistent lacing. I used to not like this beer, but perhaps my pallette has matured beyond hasty expectations of big, overly candy-like dark, fruity tasting Belgian strong ales. I am humbled and exalted at the same time. This beer makes me want to eat something savory and earthy, yet not heavy or too rich.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Orrshow,4.1,Appearance  The look of Orval is great. It pours a cloudy deep orange into my Orval glass and produces a phenomenal amount of whitish meringue head. The head has good staying power and leaves lots of lacing.  Smell  The first aromas I get from this beer are those of apple and coriander. There is some citrus for sure with lemon and orange coming to mind first. There seems to by a slight sweetness with a little pepper as well. Very nice and strong.  Taste  The flavor of this beer is a little different than I expected after smelling it. It has a reasonable amount of citrus but also some sourness. I can detect a little yeast and some spiciness as well. There is a little melon too. There is a slight sweet hay flavor as well as I get to the end of the beer.  Mouthfeel  The body is decent. It feels a little oily and thin. The carbonation is high but doesnt make itself known as much as it could.  Drinkability  Orval is easy to drink in every way. I preferred savoring this though.  A fairly complex and interesting beer. It have always enjoyed Orval and would never turn one down.,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,mmcave,4.25,"I originally had this during a tasting this summer, at that time I was not quite wowed in comparison to other trappists, but recently I thought it needed a try all on its own. Here goes: poured into a tulip glass rather haphazardly a huge foamy head like the top of mount Everest or something, with thick sticky white snow lacing all over. The retention is wonderful. Smells of pilsner malt, lots of nice citrus, hints of apple, light spice, and saaz hops maybe, first beer I think of in relation is Duvel, at least in the nose. Taste how ever is little like that Belgian devil. Taste is crisp and refreshing, bitterness is minimal on this, same with sweetness. I was expecting a little more sweetness toward the middle and finish, which this one does not really have, I think thus it lends its self to consumption in mass quantities, or at least more than one. I feel like I can really taste the quality of the water in this, more so than other trappists, something about its subtleness allows that element to shine through. I also heard that Orval makes some tasty cheese, which I will have to purchase along with another of these. All and all this is my least favorite trappist ale for just drinking, but I have a sneaking suspicion that with the right food it might do better than its other family members.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

S: can smell some kind of sour fruits..apples maybe. yep, sour fruits.... somehow VERY intruguing very interesting...  T: this is definitely the most unique trappist ive ever had. apples mostly, but a sour taste gives it an interesting twist. still, not anything to get excited about, IMO...  M: medium-bodied. Seems to suit the beer at hand, but still kinda thin for me....  D: Could keep it up all night.

37,129,pmcadamis,3.65,"This is the brew that will earn me my first mug icon for initiate status! For such a special moment, I thought that I should try something special.  A - Honey-gold cloudy brew with a monsterously huge rocky four finger plus head and tons of sticky dry lace. This has one of the most beautiful heads, and definitely the nicest lace that Iv'e ever seen. Lots of tiny bubbles float to the top, and there are a few little sediments of yeast although decanted carefully.  S - Honeycomb, pancakes and waffles, gentle melon and grape notes, sweet bakery yeast, and a little whiff of alcohol. This aroma is gentle and very inviting. Could be a bit more forceful though....I love the smell, but it's on the lighter side (it does, however, open up quite a bit with warmth).  T - Very grapey and fruity at first with a nice hop kick in the middle and a gradually progressive sourness dominates the ending. This really is much fruitier, hoppier, and tart than I would have expected from the nose. I think that the honey sweetness is a bit overpowered by the hops.  M - Bites with sour acidity, and finishes very dry and hoppy.  D - Really, this is not that outstanding. It looks great and smells unique but weak, but the taste is just pretty bad. And at six bucks for a tiny little bottle....this stuff is really not worth it.  My bottle was almost a year old. I would like to try aging this stuff to see if it mellows out a little bit....IMO the hop bite and sour acidity (normally two things I crave!) might have overpowered the subtle nuances of this brew. Way, way overated.  I've never experienced such a disparity between how a beer smells and how it tastes. This one smells beautiful, sweet, and delicate but tastes brash and overbearingly bitter. I guess the lesson here is don't trust your nose...Yankee Candles smell good too, but I wouldn't eat one.  Check out Orval's website while you're at it. It's really cool.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Grundle20,4.25,"Appearance: Pours copper in color with a fair amount of sedimentary haze. There is a massive pillowy white head that laces the glass with swards of foam.  Smell: There's an apparent banana scent that is paired well with a Belgian yeast character. The smell is mildly obvious and pleasant overall.  Taste and Mouthfeel: Tropical fruit notes and minor banana hints build up the majority of this beer's flavor. It drinks light and crisp which works well with how effervescent the beer is. The beer finishes dry with an exit of fruit punch and leaves you with little aftertaste.  Drinkability: This beer is damn tasty and pretty low ABV for a Belgian beer. I could easily supplant my american hefeweizen for this beer on any day. One of the more drinkable Belgian beers I've ever had.  Bottom Line: A beer, that to me, lives up to it's reputation. I think it would have been even better had it aged a little because this bottle was a little on the ""green"" side. A must for any Belgian fan or somebody looking to get in to Belgian beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,TheManiacalOne,4.42,"Poured from a 0.33L bottle into an over-sized wine glass.  A: The beer is a bright amber color, with a large foamy white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.  S: The aroma is robust with mostly yeast and fruit, along with some spice.  T: The taste is very sweet and fruity with flavors of lemon, orange, banana & pineapple. Theres some yeast presence and a mild hops character, but hardly any bitterness. I wasnt expecting this beer to be so sweet, but its definitely a unique and pleasant surprise.  M: Crisp and very smooth, medium body, high carbonation, very clean finish for such a sweet beer.  D: This one is very tasty and goes down ridiculously easy with no hint of alcohol. I could certainly stay with this beer for quite a while.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Pegasus,4.5,"Appearance: Hazy medium brown color, with a small scattering of white foam, and little carbonation.  Aroma: The aroma manifests incredible complexity, with banana, vanilla, candy sugar, and hints of earth combined in a dazzling manner.  Taste: Opens with a slightly toasty, earthy note. The taste turns mildly hoppy midway through the taste, and finishes dry with a mildly earthy character.  Mouth feel: Smooth, soft, very full, and quite pleasant.  Drinkability/notes: Simply superb, one of the best of the Trappist-brewed beers, remarkable in its excellence.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,HoustonTX,4.44,"Orval Trappist Ale, take number two.  Pours a light brown with highlights of amber. Frothy, bubbly head sits upon the body. Loads of carbonation streams easily float upwards.  Damn, this beer is still one of the best smelling ones I have encountered to date. Such balance, euphoria, and loads of flavor. Tons of fruity flavors enter the nasals. Dark fruit, grapes, and pear. Mandarin oranges, pineapple, and sweet melon fringe the edges. The fruit esters in this Belgium are absolutely amazing, and give proof that lower ABV does not take away from the quality of the brew.  Taste is appealing, and flavorful. While not living up to the high expectations of the smell the taste does not dissapoint. Sweet malty upfront that lingers throughout. With background flavors of fruit and floral hops. It's swift, and stingy mouthfeel feels great. This may be one of the most drinkable Belgians made. In my opinion that is.  A classic, and the definitive Belgian Pale Ale. Thank you Orval.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,mwagner1018,4.7,"Poured out of a traveled .33L bottle into an Orval glass. Purchased this beer in Belgium, survived the arduous journey back to the states, settled for about 2 months at about 55deg F....then was thourougly enjoyed!  Orval poured out a beautiful mid October fall color of Orange, dusted yellow, and amber. Settled with a nice head, good aroma, great carbonation release up from the center bottom of the glass. This beer had a very fruit induced, orange and spicy aroma. I liked the subdued but noticable taste of strong German hops. I would rate this as a good drinkable beer, but would like a bit more substance in the mouthfeel....The taste of this beer definitely shines above 50deg. Overall, I rank it second among the ales of the Trappiste Bieres!",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Expressive, high-toned, fruity nose with grape and crabapple character, along with some herbaceousness.  More restrained flavors that lean to the dry side of the spectrum, particularly for a Belgian. Quite complex with notes of tarragon, guava, and exotic spices. Mouthfeel is fairly unimpressive...the only weak point of this brew.  Finishes moderately long and dry.  An interesting, distinctive ale that manages to be both incredibly complex and impressively balanced.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,dbalsock,3.62,"So I finally decided to try this one, after hearing the name occasionally enough to be interested. I found the appearance to be pretty nice, especially due to the beautiful white head. The amber color was nice, but standard, so the head really did the job of making it a beautiful sight. The aroma was great as well; very fruity and sweet. I picked up a good deal of banana, and maybe some brown sugar plum notes. However, the taste was way different; consisting of some light malts, overly intensive vegetable like hops and the occasional addition from the nose. The mouthfeel was overly bitter for my taste, but the consistency was nice and thin/smooth. I am not interested in trying this beer again, considering I expected much more and am fairly disappointed.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Truth be told, there's still some head in the glass and I'm halfway through this sucker. The smell is niiice, reminding me of a rose garden, apples and perhaps a bit of citrus... lemon maybe... The flavor is complex as well with subtle tastes of apple, flowers and a bit of spice, among other things. Mouthfeel is smooth, crisp, slightly ""snappy.""

37,129,doppelmeup,3.83,"Had a bottle of this at the Rathskeller in Indianapolis.  Poured into a snifter glass, this beer was dark amber and had a nice creamy layer of foam which floated on top of the beer and refreshed itself everytime I swirled the glass.  Slight bubblegum, slight yeast aroma. Not as strong as other Belgian ales I've had, but definitely a Belgian aroma.  Taste was surprisingly dry, with a bit of bubblegum flavor in the background. This beer was quite unique, somewhere between a saison and a Duval, but defitely unique. Slightly bitter.  Moderate carbonation with a clean, crisp finish.  Overall, a unique brew but not my favorite Belgian ale. And at $6-7 per bottle in the store and $10 at the restaurant, it is quite pricey.

37,129,yelterdow,3.82,"Cellared for four years almost to the day, I've been saving this one for an uninterrupted hour for reviewing. Bottled 10/22/02, this is being served in the appropriate Orval clalice with the little fish on it. Here goes nothing.  Appearance- Upon popping the cap, I'm greeted with a loud *hiss* and that unmistakable Orval nose... part funk, part I have no idea. The first pour is crystal clear medium gold, with a crackling white head that spreads evenly over the beer's surface. Draperies of lacing cling behind, showing good structure... there are many streams of effervescence launching from the bottom of the glass.  Smell- There is nothing quite like Orval's aroma. Love it or hate it, it's the most unique and distinctive nose on any beer... it sounds crazy to list gauze pads and a first-aid kit as positive attributes, but the yeast strain is just phenomenally weird. I'll stop there.  Taste- This beer is a difficult one to review, it's so indescribably unique. Funky plastic hops with a sourbready, bone dry finish... the aftertaste lingers and echoes its yeast, calling out for an appropriate cheese to pair with. Complex and a delightful anomaly.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- A lively, crisp entry defers to a subtle, easy seafoaminess... elegantly drinkable. The big flavors mentioned earlier can get a bit tiring over the course of a tasting, so food is recommended. A one-of-a-kind authentic Trappist ale with its own story.  The final pour with sediment: Disappointing. Leave it behind.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

This beer pours to a murky golden brown with a creamy head and some lacing.  The smell is citrus like. lemon, with a hint of spice.  Taste is sweet then tart liked the smell with a tiny hop bite and a light undertone of alcohol. Fairly well balanced if you like tartness.  Mouth feel is light and creamy with plenty of carbonation.  I gave it a low drinkabilty mark because I dont like tart beers. Other wise a fairly sound choice.

Pours cloudy orange with a thick, creamy off-white head that thins to a very well-retained rocky covering. Some lacing clings to the sides of the glass.  The smell is of lemon peel, tartness, and spicy sourdough.  The taste is unique and complex. Tart lemon, spiced dough and a wine-like vinegar are all present throughout. A sharp hop bitterness peeks through. Only slight hints of alcohol are present. The medicinal finish has a fresh, acidic character.  The feel is creamy and light. Somewhat drying. The body stays firm and the fresh feeling lingers on the tongue.  It's a wonderful sipping brew that I enjoy as an occassional treat.

The worst beer a monk has ever made for me!  Slightly cloudy, an off orange colour.  Smell was of sour apples, no head, just a wisp, which went almost straight away.  Tasted of the same sour apples as the smell, sharp and fizzy.  If it had been a blind tasting, I would have said it was a rough Cider or a really poor Geuze.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

This bottle was purchased at the Chesapeake Gourmet in Queenstown, MD. Poured from as picture bottle.  Looks opaque light brown, with some orange tine. Large and thick head. I dont get much from the smell, was expecting more of a bite from it.  As my first belgian pale, I am not impressed. I picked up this beer simply because it had 'Trappist' in the title. There is no mention of the type on the bottle. Shame on me.  I will say that it tastes very fresh, no real alcohol byte. Little hop after the swallow. Overall tastes dry to me. I was expecting more flavor.  Hopefully after I have tried more Begian pales, I can make my way back to this one.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Thick, off-white head about two fingers high.  Smelled of sweet malts and yeast.  First taste hit me with sweet dark fruits, grapes almost. Definitely a bitter aftertaste that is almost hoppy to me. Could hardly detect the alcohol.  Liked the mouthfeel as it was not heavily carbonated as I have encountered with other Belgians. Kinda medium bodied and chewy.  Lots of lacing left on the glass and head retained until the last swig. But that may be due to drinking it quicker than usual; but I couldn't help it. Delicious.

Smells of spices (cloves, cinnamon, anise), herbs (hops, grass, basil), red apple, black currant, banana, yeast, leather. Complex and appetizing.  Very dry. Some herbal, medicinal hoppy bitterness, and the flavor of herbal hops. Some acidity. Some brett-induced leathery notes, very well integrated. Very long finish - dry, herbal, medicinal.  Some astringency, which really works with the overall dryness and exaggerates it. Good carbonation. Refreshing, and surprisingly drinkable.

Smell is a very light banana and cherry orange. Mabey a little sugar in there too but no alcohol is present. Taste is a bitter mix of banana and lemon candy sugar with just a hint of hops and alcohol and cherry. Mouthfeel is pretty clean with lots of carbonation but the flavors that are left in the mouth are like a heavy perfume.

37,129,Foxman,4.03,"It pours a hazy orange amber, and is extremely carbonated. Many fingers of thick, sculptable beige head settle glacially. There's not so much lacing as a wall of froth on the inside of the glass.  The aroma reveals an underlying blanket of viscous malt, somewhat sweet and sneakily boasting caramel, vanilla, and ripe melon. Clove and coriander mate with a minty sour draft of bready yeast.  Upon tasting, there jabs a punch of semi-sweet malted grain, briefly fruity with peach and melon, then utterly dried by a maelstrom of clove, coriander, and black pepper, as well as a powerfully crisp and drying eddy of bitter herbal hops. An earthy, even funky, sourness interrupts before it becomes acrid, and the finish is an only slilghtly less bitter lingerance. It's an assertive, biting flavor personality that grows on me as I drain the glass.  Medium bodied, the tingling, edgy bitterness is very present, and quite poignant and dominant.  Ive heard people rave, and I've heard them trash this beer. For me, well, the first sip was an eye-opener, and then I slid into a very cozy comfort zone with it.

I understand that Orval is different in style to the other trappists, I can imagine why. Extreme carbonation, huge off-white head appears and fills the glass, receding slowly with nice lacing from bubbles of many different sizes. Color is hazy amber.  Aromas are sharp and citrusy, vague fruitiness is not dominant (bananas), some metallic scents.  Hitting the mouth the intense carbonation is the first impression, the beer foams on the tongue..the first flavor impression is tart and sour, a bit like a gueuze. Very dry, almost austere, and then bitter hoppiness takes over in the finish. As it warms in the glass and as I drink more, this beer feels like it has its feet in two camps...lambic and bitter, hoppy ale, battling for dominance. A pleasant battle to experience in the mouth.

Burnt orange highlights blend in the background. A massive, rocky head forms on top and magnificent patterns of sticky lacings cling all over the goblet.  The nose is amazing. Whiffs of lemon, honey, hops and sour funk yeast. Reminds me of a Lambic, must be the Brettanomyces. I inhale another big whiff and I detect sugary sweetness and random spices. I swirl the beer around and around in the goblet and I receive more complex scents.  My first sip is light, airy and sugary sweet. Complex flavors of sweet & sour battle on my palate. Again, the Lambic connection is on the forefront of my mind. A touch of lemon or lime citrus dipped in honey with a quality that provides a beautiful hop snap on the finish. This beer is also interestingly dry while a pressured carbonation blast prickles my tongue.  This is one amazing, unique and uncompromising monster of a trappist ale. A world class offering and strongly recommended.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,depechemode1983,4.55,Serving type - 11.2oz stubby brown bottle with best before date printed on back. the site says 6.20% by volume but my bottle says 6.90% by volume  Apperance - light orange/brown amber color outstanding head plenty of lace to go around. very impressive  Smell - sour-citric smell. acidy fruit comes to mind such as lemons limes. floral smells linger. slight sweet smell  Taste - tart spicy taste up front. crisp finish with a definite hop presence thats excellent. floral and plant tartness that really sticks Mouth feel is decent with good carbonation and a little watery feel.  Note: this is one fine ale. loved it from start to finish..just too bad its so high priced and very hard to find in my area.,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,ndekke39,4.42,"Shared a bottle of this with some good friends. Bottled on 1/24/06 and best-by 1/24/11. Poured a cloudy honey color with a bright white head and lots of lacing. Smells of so many things... apple, honey, banana, peach, yeast. Wonderful to stick your nose in. Taste was dry, fruit, and hoppy. Overall flavors ran the gamut from sweet to bitter to sour. Each sip brought something new out. Mouthfeel was bright and fizzy. Overall, excellent beer. Great to sip. Highly recommended.  Tried another bottle in September 2007. Bottled on 1/24/06 and best-by 1/24/11. Poured like a very cloudy cider. Small, white head, with little bits of lacing. Smells again of apple, plus some champagne. A little bitterness like an apple peel. Needs to warm up a bit. Very effervescent, like a champagne! This must be one result of the aging. Again, it's wonderful to drink, especially with good friends. Looking forward to trying another bottle next Labor Day!  And we shared yet another bottle in September 2008. Bottled 1/24/06, best by 1/24/11. Poured like clear-ish apple juice, nice thick white head, lots of lacing, great retention. Smells of apples and champagne. Taste is starting to flatten out. Very dry. Taste of apples, bitter at the end, like old coffee. Very effervescent mouthfeel. It's getting less nuanced, but we have 2 more bottles and will see it through to Labor Day 2010!  Opened our fourth bottle in September 2009. Like the rest, bottled 1/24/06 and best by 1/24/11. Poured a clear deep yellow. Lots of foam, very fizzy and rocky. Lots of lacing on the glass. Aromas of yeast, fermented apple cider, pears, white wine like a Riesling. Tastes of white wine, champagne, apples. Taste begins well, but ends with a flat burn. Almost tastes old. Mouthfeel is a bit flat, despite all the foam. Still interesting, but the beer is mellowing out. One more bottle for next year!  Opened our fifth and final bottle in September 2010. Like every one of them, bottled 1/24/06 and good until 1/24/11, although it doesn't seem to be holding up too well. Very foamy on the pour, with a consistent fluffy white head. Color looks darker and cloudier this year. Smells like apple cider vinegar. Tastes a little flat, like cardboard or wood; it's like a very weak wine. Mouthfeel is still fizzy and bright. This beer has about three months left in its life, but already it seems to be turning into nothing.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Vancer,2.91,"Heres a very disappointing brew, perhaps from over-hyped expectorations. The pour started on the right foot - a hazy amber orange with pillowy, sticky ivory head. This one had legs running down the glass.  Only some hints of Belgium yeast and orange. topped by sweet malts. But the taste  wow, just not there. A stringent and soapy blend of two not pleasant tastes. Dry and crisp, yeah, but the drinkability was off the chart, at a freakin $5 a 11.2 oz bottle.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Head is slightly reinforced by stready streams of tiny bubbles. Thin lacing holds for a minute or two but melts quickly. Brew is a darker golden-orange-amber; the color is actually very rich.  s: hoppier than i would expect, but still gives hints of that malt / earth aroma.  t/m: first impression is dry / fizz / tang in that order. once my pallate adjusted it washed down a little smoother. for my own personal tastes this is over-carbonated and bloating, much like sweet drinks such as dr. pepper and champagne.  d: i may have rated the drinkability .5 higher than i should simply due to the sheer fact its orval trappist. in order to drink more than one of these i would have to take a half-hour belching break in between, the bloating effect is so high.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Osiris9588,2.72,"This is my first reveiw of an Orval Trappist Ale, but the second bottle I have tried. I disliked the first bottle so much that I figured the bottle had been mishandled, subject to improper conditions. I also think I drank it too cold.  I made sure that this second bottle was down to a proper temperature, but I found it as equally unpleasant--though I did purchase it from the same shop. Also, the beer did progressively improve somewhat from the fist sip to the last. My palate needed to be conditioned to it.  I don't think that it is a completely horrible beer, much of my dislike has to do with personal preference. Both the bottles I have drunk have been capped, 11.2 bottles. The color is a murky amber with traces of sediment. There is ample carbonation, with a torrent of bubbles racing to the surface. The head is thick, leaving considerable, big-bubbled lacing.  The aroma offers strong citrus and yeast, a formidable floral quality, and a hint of cinnamon. The taste offers plenty of citrus and spice, strong yeast and hoppy bitterness. The characteristic that ruins this ale for me is the phenolic aspect--it is so intense and overbearing. A glass full of dirty band-aids. That sums it up. The mouthfeel is crisp and bright, and the drinkability would be fine, except for the extremly unbalanced, phenolic finish, and resulting aftertaste.  A glass full of dirty band-aids. And I love Trappist ales, but not this one. My tongue feels as if I've been been eating pennies all day, and then maybe licked a dead bloated otter.  Maybe the poor quality has something to do in the way the shop handled this particular shipment--but lightning has stuck twice.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,afinepilsner,3.8,11.2 oz brown bottle  Orval Trappist Ale was amber in color with a large white bubbly head. The head had decent retention and left plenty of lacing behind. The nose is full of trappist yeast with a little malt and slight alcohol smell. The taste was fruity (mostly citrus) and lightly spicy. The body was medium to light with plenty of carbonation. Nice drinkabilily. Overall it is a good beer and I will purchase again.,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,wl0307,4.45,"The bottle revisited today is exactly the same as the last one consumed 6 months ago--bottled on 29/11/2005. Now is time to see if half-a-year maturing has rendered it any more complex~~ Served cool in a Orval-glass like broad-rimmed goblet.  A: pours a translucent, dark reddish-orangey hue; nice and thick off-white frothy crust sustains on top of a very lively carbonated body, with a dozen streams of tiny fizziness ejecting from the bottom of the glass. Brilliant. S: the smell this time reminds me much of dry farmhouse Saison as well as Lambiek!! The dryish-sour and zesty-bitter dried lime+lemon peels combine nicely with a slightly funky and sour note of yeasts, yet is enhanced by a delicately spicy edge like nutmeg+clove+star-anise+blahblahblah... true to Orval's uniqueness of that spicy edge; the yeasty and spicy aroma is backed by a rather subtle but noticeable pale maltiness and a subtle sweetness from mixed fruit-esters. Overall, complex as ever... and crazily enjoyable. It's hard to move my little nose away from the glass~~ T: spicy and yeasty and spicy and yeasty and... followed by a bitter flow of lively yeasts, powdery and rough in texture, and laced with utterly dryish yet bitter flavour of dried lemon rind ground with clove and cinnamon and a little bit of star-anise at the back... also coming to mind is that tangy edge of new wood barrels... turning absolutely dry in the aftertaste with plenty of hops and an herbal-sweet edge very much akin to the aftertaste of Chinese mixed-herb medicine soup~~!! M&D: effervescent texture with a mouthful of creamy fizziness, medium-bodied and lots of flavours to discern with patience... Absolutely nice, NOT delicious, but very complex and worth one's 3/4 hour for slow sipping... Compared with my previous note, this bottle shows more bitterness and is not as fruity as the last bottle. Will review another bottle from the same batch in another six months~~",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,dblinkhorn,4.13,"Poured from 11.2 oz bottle into a tulip glass.  Appearance - This beer pours with a large off-white, slightly tan head that is overall pretty soapy (large bubbly head). It dissipates at a pretty slow rate and settles as a thin layer of lace on top of the beer. As it goes down, there is a nice sticky lace on the glass. The brew is hazy honey orange color with a bit of carbonation liveliness in the glass.  Smell - Honey and lemon are the most profound smells on the nose, paired nicely with some medium dark fruits aromas. Cloves and nutmeg make up the spice character of the aromas. There is only a very, very slightly noticeable amount of alcohol on the nose. The hops smell crisp and dry with a low bitterness scent, and the malt scents slightly earthy and raw smelling.  Taste - A rich but fairly mellow malt flavor is up front in the taste. Honey again makes a mark, along with the medium-dark fruit flavors. The spices flavors are stronger than in most beers of this style, but they go well with the rest of the flavors. In the background there is a crisp, lightly bitter hop flavor, along with lemon (or other citrus) rind. The alcohol is present just after the initial part of the taste, and is pretty light in power. It lasts up through the finish, in combination with a moderate earthy flavor. I expected a bit more flavor from this brew.  Mouthfeel - Moderate carbonation level, fairly light alcohol sensation. The brew itself is medium- to light-bodied and somewhat smooth (again not as good as I expected).  Drinkability - This stuff reminds me more of a typical west coast U.S. micro ale than an authentic Trappist ale, which it is. Similar beer of its style easy win in taste and mouthfeel over this beer. Accordingly, it has a very high drinkability because of it's ""lightness"" all around compared with others of its style and type.  Overall, I'm somewhat dissapointed with this brew (although I was expecting a lot after having the other Trappist ales). This stuff definitely falls short of the other five Trappists, but overall it is still quite a good brew. Recommended at least.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,DaveFL1976,4.03,"I'd had this beer before in the US, and I wasn't particularly impressed with it. I found it a bit harsh and astringent.  But then I went to Belgium.  Specifically, to a little town called Orval.  After poking around the courtyard of the monestary and meeting a monk, my wife and I went down the road 100 meters to the cafe. I had the full strength, my wife had the green bottle.  It poured a lovely deep reddish/cherry color with a frothy off-white head. Smell was sweet and spicy. The taste...so much better than how I'd remembered it. This was a damn fine beer. Sweet up front, but balanced out with a certain spicyness that balances things out nicely. A nice beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,RobertDwight,4.58,"Poured into my lovely Orval challis. It has a deep orange and light reddish/brown color to it. The head is outstanding, it looks so creamy. The head almost reminds me of soft peak egg whites, kind of like meringue. I smell a lot of citrus, and it also reminds me of the smell of a lambic. Tastes of toffee and fresh bread at first, then quickly moves to the citrus & spicy bitterness of the hops which lingers on the tounge a while after taking a drink. This beer reminds me of a lemon meringue pie. I am a huge fan of this beer and think people should drink more of it.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,jdoolin,4.78,"Presentation: awesome 11.2 oz bottle, poured into an Orval chalice  Appearance: burnt orange amber, big, foamy head that lasted the entire time. A truly beautiful beer.  Aroma: Citrusy and floral with a bit of horse blanket  Taste: Slight sweetness up front that doesn't last. Crisp and dry, notes of citrus and pine and the ever present brett character. Some bready malt in the finish. Somewhat light but very smooth mouthfeel.  Notes: Such an interesting, flavorful and refreshing beer. The most unique of the Trappists ales that I've had. Great complexity. I'll always have one of these on hand.  [Edit]: The more of this beer I have, the more I love it.

Smell - a sour barn-like odor. Not much else. Some alcohol.  Taste - same as the smell. A sour barn-like must, with very faint tones of plums. Alcohol on the finish, and not really integrated into the taste.  Mouthfeel - thin, fluid, and fizzy.

37,129,rayjay,3.9,"Bottled Jan 24, 2006 (7 months old).  Gimongous head, even when poured extremely slow. Had to wait a few minutes to drink it! Very bubbly like champange. Fairly dark pale color and hazy.  Smell is sweet and bready, like pumpernickle. Very Belgian profile, similar to the Saison Dupont I had last night. Additionally, I detect Brett.  Taste is complex; there is a definate pilsner bite with some hoppiness (the skunky kind), but the malts are more along the lines of a Belgian pale. Then there's the sour undertone kind of like...um...the melted ice cubes of an empty glass of orange juice. Unmistakably Belgian, defined by the yeast.  A hard water taste and feel that lingers in the aftertaste, making it very dry. Alcohol warmth also lasts for a while. Almost reminds me of a British mild, one that has sour notes like a Guinness. Also reminds me of homebrew with a slight infection (one that is still pleasant to drink).  Too young, I can see very clearly that this beer has yet to see it's full potential. It tastes a little watered down and unfinished.  I hadn't had this beer in years and completely forgot what it tasted like. I really dig the flavor. Dispite it's young age, it shows it's greatness underneath. Worth cellaring a few bottles. Cheers.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Smell: Smells like sweettarts, has an odd artificial watermelon smell, bubblegum, and some other maltiness. Not the most appealing thing I have ever smelled.  Taste: All the smells are well represented. A sour and dry flavor, that is a little fruity, with a slight earthiness and vegetable aspect. Not my favorite, a very weird beer.

Pepper, plums and raisins surface to the nose. The flavor seems to be dominated by spices. Black pepper seems to be present with a slight hop presence and an almost mustiness near the finish.

37,129,trevorwideman,4.48,"Well well well, I'm a lucky guy to have found this one last night here in Manitoba. I was like a kid in a candy store.... 2004 vintage.  Pours a hazy orange copper colour with a huge head. Correction, massive head. This head actually grows as you down the glass. Pour very carefully. The pillowy, fluffy head leaves a thick lace all the way down the glass. The vicious carbonation is a thing of beauty. Smell is exceedingly spicy and a bit musty. There's a huge floral bouquet, like springtime when the Lilacs begin to bloom.  Taste is just as intense, like you were tasting all outdoors at one. Floral and Wild, lots of herbal flavour. Some earthy grassy notes. A tangy and spicy lemony sourness comined with an exquisite hop character that's very well balanced. This beer just dances around the palate, and is very complex. The mouthfeel is full of body, a little sticky. Clean, with a little dryness in the finish. This was an amazing surprise and a real treat for me, The ABV being what it is, it's exceedingly drinkable, but the actual quality of the beer makes you want to save these for a special occasion. Also, I'd like to come back to it in a year or so, see what's changed.

37,129,mjc410,4.6,"The pour into my Chimay chalice brings forth a voluminous head, 3/4 of an inch high. It is just a little tan, and quite rocky. The beer's color is a bright copper, nit the least bit hazy. The fleur-de-lis at the glass's bottom produces a marvelous carbonation column. Head retention in particular is astonsihing, so much that I'm forced to wait ten minutes for my first non-frothy sip. I certainly can't fault it for this .though.  The nose is full of sugar, bubblegum, caramel, bananas, pears, green grapes, cloves, cinnamon, pepper, and a plethora of other scents I can't pin down. A symphony of scent!  Taste begins with vinous fruit, hits a lemon note, hop bitterness, and ends with biscuity grain. Rich, spicy, and complex, and somewhat alcoholic. Pouring in the dregs restrains the flavor a bit, so I would recommend a careful decanting.  Mouthfeel is approaching thick, and the carbonation is enough to be tingly. Surely coats the mouth.  Overall, a great beer, that, despite its low ABV, ages with grace.  Notes: ""BOTTLED ON 07.10.2004 BEST BEFORE 07.10.2009""  I wonder how this would taste closer to the ""expiration date."" I bought this bottle in the summer of '04, along with another, and drank one immediately. I thought the beer at the time too strong, so I cellared this one until now.

Tart - lemon zest, basil, kaffir lime leaves, and pepper. Yeasty finish resembles bread dough after a first rise.  Taste: Dried herbal flavor, resembling a bouquet garni - dried sweet basil, thyme, oregano, and sage. Very dry with a mild fruity body - oranges and honey present underneath herbal body. Develops a little butter, while maintaining good balance between dryness and zesty notes. Unique in its flavor profile.  Mouthfeel: Thin, dry, and cleansing. Raspy finish is assertive but remains refreshing.  Drinkability: One of the most unique, complex beers I've had - a little challenging, as I haven't had this before, but certainly compelling.

Nose is sharp and tangy. Hops with some Belgian spices. Mouthwatering.  Flavor is tangy and tasty. Very unlike any Trappist brew I have had before. A little funk, some malt and spice up-front too.

The head is very fine, but merengue-like...if you tip the glass, the head will take a long time to slide back down the side. Interesting.  Smell is of esthers, cherries, smoked meat?, black tea, some diacetyl, fresh mown grass, malty goodness. This smells really good.  Taste is really not as complex as I was expecting, but is excellent nonetheless. Grapes, a smoky note, delicate malts that melt in your mouth, curds, and slight alcohol noticable. This beer was somewhat too cold when poured, I expect that as it warms up and sheds a bit of its lively carbonation it will improve in both mouthfeel and taste.  The mouthfeel is also very good. The carbonation, though high, doesn't hit too soon, and the diacetyl gives it a very smooth feeling as you sip. The CO2 hits in the back, and the alcohol has a cleansing effect that leaves your mouth feeling refreshed, even with the loads of malts that were obvious up front.  Overall this is a terrific brew. It's better slightly warm...if you order it, have the patience to let it warm up a bit (I prefer around 55).",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Appearance: Effervescent and cloudy ice tea color with a huge white head. The head settles nicely and retains well.  Flavor: More spicy notes (coriander, cloves, black pepper), pears, green apples, and white raisins.  Mouthfeel: Medium-light, bubbly, drying alcohol notes and just a touch of astringency at the end. Could have used a little more body and less carbonation here and it would have put this beer over the top for me. My tongue just couldn't get over the carbonation.  Overall impression: Part of my continuing quest to sample all the classic commercial examples. This one was interesting, well crafted, and worthy of it's reputation.

This one's also pretty carbonated. The first bottle I opened foamed big time! I liked the carbonation on it and found that it imrpoved the drinkability to a certain extent.

Definite spice notes, with a hint of tartness. Cinammon and cloves present, but not as detectable in the taste as opposed to the scent. No malt sweetness here, and the hops are only present in traces amounts.  My bottle seems a bit too carbonated.

The body is a cloudy maroon color with lots of little bubbles steaming from various locations on the glass.  S: Oak, soury pungent, clove like yeast, honey, floral and some citrus.  T: One of the more confusing beers on the market. Surprises around every corner. Begins very biscuity, earthy. Very dry, almost salty. Bready flavors then slink towards a more grain/wheat flavor. Bittering hops make a play and finish the palate with an extremely dry complexity. Not as sour as the nose would lead you to believe. Aftertaste is somewhat grainy.  M: Medium to full body with the classic Belgian carbonation.  D: In a blind taste test this beer could pass for a saison, easy. This beer is a trip.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Into an Orval goblet, the pour results in a hazy, bright, and golden appearance...inviting. Big bubbly head that faded somewhat fast without leaving much lace. The smell is intriguing. Sweet and sour apple, and yes, the hay and barnyard animal is evident. Tastes tart and finishes with the hay. Not as sweet as I expected or wanted, but still very good. The dryness seems to linger forever. I found this very drinkable, and could drink this year round.  A unique, intriguing, complex beer. I would love to try this fresh.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,Damian,3.24,"Poured a hazy, dark, copper-amber with a dense foamy head. Tons of bubbly lacing which fell nicely along the glass.  Smell consisted of intense yeast, hops and alcohol.  Taste was sharp. Very sour on the front end. Hoppy with hints of citrus and mild spices. Alcohol flavor was overwhelming and unexpected (seeing as this beer was - according to the bottle - only 6.9% ABV). Huge, hoppy, bitter aftertaste.  Dry mouthfeel. Moderate carbonation.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,jettjon,3.98,"Highs: Appearance, flavor Lows: None  Pours a coppery orange brown with no bubbles beneath a thick whitish-tan head. Fades slowly away leaving good heavy lacing on the wine glass. Nose is quite unusual asparagus? Dusty? Yes, I was surprised to find others describing this one as dusty, but there you have it. Taste is in the same vein. Initially, its semi-sweet, rapidly turning dry. Theres a definite sour fruit flavor, something like sour grapes or wild grapes such as muscadine. Its tart, sour, and a bit oaky. Finishes very crisp and dry, almost like a clean red wine. Mouth is watery, fairly bubbly/sparkling, but borderline thin. Drinkability for me is not so great as I am not a fan of sour beers, but if you dont mind the taste, its probably quite drinkable.  Overall: Definitely an unusual brew, and one that not everyone will enjoy. However, its well put together and definitely worth a try.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,RichThatchr,4.35,"This is great ale. I could drink this all night and I have an idea it is a step higher on draft. It poured so well into a fat ivory head, at least 3"" tall, before settling in parts, but never really going away. The amber red body had that familiar shake of its tail before my first taste exploded with unusual qualities of bitters, dryness, and light fruits. The taste lingered long after I put the glass down to note various flavors as well as the alcohol content.  This Trappist ale would be superb with broiled or bbq'd pork chops and a little apple sauce on the side.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

T: Somewhat hoppy up front followed by minty flavors and a spicy finish. A very unique taste that I can't get enough of.  M: Medium-full bodied with tons of carbonation.  D: Defnitely the most unique of the Trappist beers that I've had to date, and my favorite, I think.

Pours with a big fizzy head, very clear (first pour was clear but clouded up on 2nd pour due to yeast), beautiful orange tinted color. Aroma has distinct sour and slightly funky belgium smell. Complex blend of fruity esters with clove and raisins.  Dry mouthfeel (almost powdery), high carbonation and a tart dry finish. Crackery aftertaste.  Taste is tart apples, strong clove, spicy, and dried fruit.. Kind of crackery malt flavor leaves a very strange feeling in your mouth. I actually feel thirsty!  I've had this beer a few times and always enjoy it. Flavor is a bit different from other trappists but mouthfeel definately can be a little distracting. Still it is a trappist ale with a very nice flavor and aroma.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,soultrain,3.98,"Poured into an Orval chalice.  A-Orange beer, beige head, murky with small yeast chunks. Looks pretty damn good sitting in the old Orval chalice, yup. 1/2"" head settles to 1/4"" in a minute. No lacing. S-Enticing sourness in the aroma. Some alcohol, too. Kinda like a cologne made with dried orange peels. T-Well hopped, nice bitterness, earthy, a bit sour, but most of all dry. Dryyy in a real good way. The yeast has a peppery spicy flavor to it, and the drying alchohol finish and the ""Orval burps"" that result make this one of the most unique brews to ever cross my path, lips, palette, etc.... This beer blooms as it warms, of course, and in my experience with this beer, no two sips are the same, and no two bottles are identical. What a chameleon! I find this beer hard to describe, actually, as words like ""dust"" and ""dirt"" and ""Musty like an old mansion"" keep entering my skull as I'm drinking.... Final yeast pour turned the last inch of beer to mud; a tasty mud, though. M-This particular bottle had an over-ample, fizzy, champagne-like carbonation that I hadn't noticed before in previous bottles. Light body. D-Unusual beer to say the least. When I have it with dinner, I tend to forget what I'm eating and dwell on this perplexing beer...is this good? Healthy?  CRUX: UNIQUE AND FASCINATING BELGIAN BREW HERE.

Taste is extremely dry citus peel. I've never tasted a beer as dry as this. This could very easily substitute for a dry white wine yet with much more flavor and depth.

Taste is dry and crisp that is highly carbonated, spicey, grassy and tart. This has got to be one of the dryest tasting beers I have ever had. While it is a good beer, I admit that it is just not my thing. It was just a little too dry for me and I didn't particularly enjoy the earthy/grassy taste.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Phocion,4.68,"I originally reviewed this just over nine years ago, let's see how my tastes have changed. New review July 10, 2015. Bottle dated 11/14 and poured into an Orval chalice. Dark golden-brown and a big, frothy, and long-lasting off-white head that leaves thick sheets of lacing along the glass.  Aroma is a nice balance of hops and yeast. Bright fruity esters and a nice floral Continental hoppiness. Subtle biscuit malts and a touch of funk and crisp tartness. Citrus and tropical esters.  Flavor is very hop-forward despite its eight months of age. Grassy, floral, and peppery. Candi sugar and typical Belgian fruity yeast also adds to a caramel maltiness. What really makes this beer unique is the perfectly-implemented level of Brett funk, which is assertive but far from overpowering. Ever-so-subtle light acidic tartness on the finish. Excellent balance.  Medium bodied and with a quite creamy mouthfeel, but doesn't feel too full. Crisp and refreshing finish.  I haven't had this beer in years, and that's a damned shame. Even in today's over-saturated craft market, this thing is still a world-class beer. Even better than I remember from my first ancient review of it.    (Original review: 6/16/2006/Rated 4.03) Bottle dated 10/05, so this is about 9 months old. Poured into an Orval chalice. Thick golden-brown with a huge foamy head and great retention.  Malty and fruity overtones, especially pear. Quite an alcohol scent as well, though we are approaching 7% (the site lists this at 6.2, but my bottle says 6.9).  Very dry and earthy taste. Alcohol content is evident as well, not as well hidden as most Belgians. The pears are coming through as an undertone, and it is neither as fruity or malty as the scent.  Medium-bodied. Very dry and crisp on the palate.  This is a good treat, but definitely not a session beer. Very dry and fairly high ABV. Overall I'd recommend it, but not more than one or two a night.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,hunteraw,4.13,"Sampled at a Belgian restaurant/bar in Cape Town, I think this one has become a new favorite.  Appearance: pours a honey-amber color, good head, some lacing.  Smell: floral, fresh hops aromas - this isn't your typical Belgian! I'm surprised by how forward the hops are. There's some sweetness in here, too, but not overwhelming like some others I've had lately. Not so much else going on aroma-wise, though.  Taste: very nice and complex. Sweet at the front, then has a grassy fresh hops flavor before finishing on a fig note.  Mouthfeel: ahh, nice and dry - refreshing in a Belgian, and very unlike the others I've had recently. Carbonation is good, and the aftertaste is nice.  Drinkability: I liked this one a lot. Many Belgians are too sweet for me, but this one was dry, had a real hop presence, and was overall very drinkable.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Pours a hazy dark amber with an incredible dark white, rocky head that lasts a few minutes before receding. Sourish smell with hints of pine, yeast and bread. Taste includes all of the smell flavors with a hint of candy sugar and clove. The mouthfeel is a bit thin for a trappist, but Orval is one of the lightest bodied trappist beers being a pale ale. Drinkability is one of the best because of the light body. I have been drinking this beer for over 20 years, since it was the only one available in my area, and a wonderful consistency over that time span.  Just a thought,  barleyman",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

The head stayed with the beer throughout, leaving thick lacing on the side of the glass and chunks of foam on the bottom of the glass. The taste was good, but less than remarkable, slightly weaker than most trappists that I've had. Overall, it was an enjoyable beer.

37,129,VoodooBrew,4.47,"""Bottled on 04.01.2005""  Now here we have an interesting beer...  The nose initially reminds me somewhat of a Gueuze, with its musty, candyish notes -- although of course not nearly as over the top. A dose of hop flavor and bitterness greets the palate, joined by a distinctly Belgian funkiness. The finish and aftertaste demonstrate firm bitterness, certainly more so than what we're accustomed to finding in a Trappist brew.  As the beer warms and I take more sips, Orval's flavors begin to achieve greater harmony, and the beer's bitterness and muted tartness begin to play deftly off one another, with the former stepping up in prominence. Each successive sip offers a new perspective, with spice, malt, fruit, and floral notes all taking turns.  Orval is certainly a unique beer, surprising in its flavor profile, and rewarding in its rapid evolution. I do suspect this is a beer that grows on you more and more...",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Complex ""farm-like"" fruit taste, lightly spiced yeast, phenols, some tart citrus in the middle, hay...again curiously tantalizing. Lively and soft in the mouth with a long, crisp dry finish.  This is a complex belgian for sure full of all kinds of unique floral and perfume tones. This would be a great summer beer. Two years old seems to be a fine time to be drinking this.

Hop aroma is complex.  Taste is dry, light, and complex. Initial fruit becomes extremely dry, giving way to dirty barnyard flavors. Some lemon. Fruit returns intermittently. Some hops are noted in the dry, clean finish. Mouthfeel is full while it lasts, sterile slightly bitter finish.

37,129,tastybeer,4.58,"Mouthwateringly fantastic appearance. Golden orange color that looks thick and full. Tornado shaped sediment spirals through the middle of my glass. Brilliant white giant billowey head rises way above the rim of my glass without spilling over the edge somehow. When the massive head finally fades a 1/4 inch layer of retention lies over the glowing beer. Not to mention lacing goes all the way to the rim.  So appearance aside, this beer has a lot more awesomeness to it. Delicious farm fresh aroma. Very very reminiscent of fresh dandelions, with a plethora of other floral aromas, dry delicious lemon and grassy hops and a hint of spice. Smells like I'm in the middle of a farm on a hot breezy summer day. Taste is nicely tart and very dry hopped. Great texture. Sour lemon and sweet floral. Complex like crazy with everlasting dryness and farm fresh goodness. Great biting dryness on the tongue, with perfect dense medium body and sharp + fast carbonation. Drinkablity is very very very high especially due to this being so yummy and sexy looking.  Awesome Belgian. I see why this brewery only makes two beers. I imagine the Petite Orval is great as well.

Apricot. Clean, inviting aroma.  T - Fruity (again with the apricot). Tangy. Yeast, bready. Lingering bit of hops in the finish. Hint of a gueuze lambic-like sourness. Even a faint sherry nuttiness is apparent in spots. I haven't had Orval in years and this really tripped me out - - Very nice.  M - Crisp and dry. A little less than medium bodied with lively carbonation.  D - Very good drinkability. If only the $4.29 were for a 4pk and not for a single!! Great beer, highly enjoyable.  Bottled on 1/14/14 (2-14-2015) Haven't had Orval since I rated it above in 2006! Orange with a 3/4 inch head -- good retention and lacing. Awesome funk, fruity nose...almost barnyard type of aroma in a wine descriptor sort of way. DRY -- lively carbonation, fruit doesn't follow nose...Spicy, peppery? Different flavors overall from what I remember. The nose is definitely the winner here (going form 4 to 4.5...taste from 4.5 down to 4.

Smell is mild and gentle with nothing even close to over powering; notes of yeast, maybe corriander, a bit of citrus and cloves. Smells wonderful!! Taste is very strange. It seems to start out like a hefe and then radically change direction after the sip has been in your mouth for about 1.5 seconds and turn into a saison or a gueze.

Beer is non transparent and begins with a pillowy head that disipates down to thin layer, leaving a small amount of lacing. Smells OK. Some melon and grape tones coming through, but a little bitter. A little more and I would say the beer was skunky. Taste is better than the smell. Full of fruitiness with some clove. A little metallic flavor is happenning as well.

Attractive dark orange in color, with a monstrous white head that falls eloquently. Expressive, yeasty and hoppy nose, with hints of flowers, perfume and citrus fruits. Flavor is extremely complex, bursting with citrus fruits, exploding with hop flavor, while remaining very funky, somewhat sour, full of horseblanket and wild yeast flavors.

Smell: The yeasts used to brew this ale have created a most remarkable aroma. I can't place it, but it is fruity and gamey and dry.  Taste: The ale has a relaxed malt character that imparts a slight sweetness. The yeast leaves the ale very dry taste. The hops are light, giving just a bit of a bite.

37,129,dnrobert24,4.36,"Mmmm Orval. I would like to try this beer again with some other kinds of cheese. Unfortunately, at $4.50 a bottle, that is not likely to occur any time soon.  Poured a beautiful yellow gold with an inch-tall head in my tulip goblet. The head remained a quarter of an inch tall throughout the entire session. Even at the end of the glass, tiny bubbles continued to rise. The beer smelled of fine grass, lemon, and hay. The beer had an earthy spiciness to it and almost tasted sweaty. (Horseblanket? I don't know, I've never smelled one). There was a perfect bitterness to balance out the caradmon, black pepper, and grapfruit. I attempted to pair this with a simple grilled salmon and roasted veggies (asparagus, mushrooms, and zuccini) marinated in a dressing made from Penzey's French Country Vinagrette spice blend. The meal and beer did not contrast or compliment each other and were therefore a push. Thus, I pulled out the gruyere cheese. This cheese was a little old and losing its nutty and toasty qualities, but the beer worked wonders on it. Again, it was not the perfect match, but the hard gruyere actually tasted creamy after sipping the beer. The fading nuttiness came forth, despite the lack of nuttiness in the beer, and the cheese helped flesh out some of the spicy earthy sweaty corners of the brew. I would definitely not try this beer again unless I had a good goat cheese, gouda, or aged cheddar to go with it.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Appearance: Poured a hazy burnt orango color, similar to apple juice. The head formed a beautifully thick tan color and grew to be a good half inch higher than the top of the glass, but never spilled over the sides. Head retention is also excellent.  Aroma: Spicy with hints of lemon.  Taste: Surprisingly smooth and light for such a high alcohol content (6.9%). The taste kind of reminds me of a gueze lambic with the grassy flavors, but this is way more complex. Hints of lemon and orange in there as well. The finish is dry and seems to last forever.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth, almost watery. The carbonation is lacking, but the strong flavors more than make up for it.

37,129,Tupperwolf,3.14,"Pours an apple-juice orange-brown, rather clear until I get to the end of the pour and upend the yeast, whereupon it takes on a very slightly hazy iced tea brown with a little bit of sediment visible floating and a few small bubbles; I poured this into my Trappistes Rochefort chalice and was rewarded with a half-inch head that is currently falling down to a plump ring and some whitish scum.  I've always been a little unsure about my first time trying Orval. I've heard that it's either loved or hated, and often more readily hated than loved. I fully intend to try all the trappist beers I can get my hands on, including Orval, despite my inclination away from sour beers..  So in I go for my first cautious whiff. A very slight horsy brett note passes my nose, and then becomes a more usual Belgian scent - spicy yeast, crispy malts, slightly piney hops. I wait for it to warm to get more powerful scents, but the overall scent profile is pretty mild.  I get a bit of fermented apples in the flavor, and just a little bit of dust and must on top of a little biscuity malts and grassy, piney hops. Even as it warms, the taste leaves me less than impressed... It's just not very bold, not very strong.  The mouthfeel is extremely bright - extremely sparkling and 'tart' feeling on the tongue, with very spritzy carbonation in such tiny bubbles that it's an overall tingle. It finishes very dry, with a slight alcohol parched-throat sensation, and some bitter, musty flavor is lefft behind. It's an interesting sensation, and would be better if the flavors were a bit stronger.  Final thoughts - forgettable. I hate to say it after all that worry about what I would finally think, but I really don't think anything. It's okay, but not exceptional.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,soulgrowl,4.27,"Appearance: Body ranges from chestnut brown to iced tea orange depending on the light. The head on this thing is really interesting; after I poured it, I set it down and responded to an e-mail. When I looked back at it, the head had expanded to about an inch higher than it was before! Currently, the head is collapsing along the perimeter of the class, leaving this funny little nipple-like mesa in the middle. Very unusual, very cool.  Smell: Oh yum. This smells great, really, truly, great. It has a very toasty malt character with piney hops, mild phenols, alcohol and some zippy yeast. An odor of old homes. Kind of like a kicked-up American red.  Taste: Wow, great malt profile; buscuity, toasty, and nice and nutty. Woodsy hops, tangy yeast, and alcohol add a little spice. Tart apple cider and a flash of sweet cherry flavor comes out as you swallow. Finish has a bit of Scotch whisky-ish alcohol sweetness, followed by a dry, wheaty tang.  Mouthfeel: Nice and creamy, very frothy and chewy, but also kind of abrasive due to the alcohol.  Drinkability: This is quite drinkable, but obviously no session beer. Drink late and drink slowly... it is exceptionally savorable.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,ggaughan,4.05,The beer poured a hazy brown color with a thick creamy tan head into a tulip glass. The head lasted for quite a bit of time. The smell I got from this one is a bit of malts and some earthy notes. Interesting but not overly complex. The taste is a bit sour but also a bit of a hoppy bit. The taste is fairly complex with the sour and the bitter and some sweet. Overall I really enjoyed my Orval and will enjoy a few more in the near future.,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,kingjames1,3.31,"Popped the cap, and foam literally erupted down the side. Never had that happen with a belgium bottle-capped beer before. As a result, it poured with a massive, thick tan head. Looks great, and the head lasts and lasts on this one. Smells complex, with lemony citrus, coriander, pepper, and something funky ('wet horse blanket', I once heard suggested, but I wouldn't know). Taste - interesting! Weird. I've had an Orval once before, but stupidly smoked a cigar with it (and as a result, tasted nothing). Now my palate is quite clear. I don't think I've ever tasted a beer quite like it. It has that infamous funk of a farmhouse-style. But it is sour, and really dry. Oh! A fruit fly just got caught in the head - sucker's doomed in this froth-swamp. Fly's are attracted to funk.  The sour-dry finish is reminiscent of a dry red wine, like a cheap merlot ('sideways' comes to mind). Hops are definitely present, and yeast to be sure, but where's the malts? Its there, just under the sour layer of yeast and astringent hops. This is definitely a sipping beer. It kind of grows on you as you sip it - and the fruitiness (from the yeasts) becomes more noticeable to me. But over all, just doesn't agree with me very well (and I like Saisons - at least the few I've had). Good mouthfeel, light, but not terribly drinkable for the style, imo. One is enough, thanks.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,atigerlife,3.93,"Poured from a 33cl bottle into a Orval chalice.  I've had this beer quite a few times over the years and decided it was finally time to write a review. Here goes nothin...  Pours a beautiful opaque orange/brown color with a wonderful creamy off-white head. Head has good lasting strength. Very beautiful sitting in the Orval chalice.  The nose is quite spicy, with hints of many herbs: orange, pepper, and other aromas I couldn't quite pick up. Quite a ""refreshing"" and curious aroma.  The taste is very complex and spicy. Hints of coriander, mint, pepper, etc. Some decent hops and quite a dry finish. A ""crisp"" beer. The amount of flavors make this hard to describe.  The mouthfeel is quite cleansing with a medium body. Overall, I found this to be a very distinctive beer that is nicely refreshing. But, as much as I like this beer, I'm not sure how many I could drink. Not really a session beer. The thing that I like about this beer, its complexity, also makes it slightly less drinkable. Not sure if that makes sense. I also think a food match would be challenging [a few cheeses came to mind, but not much else]. Anyway, a wonderfully unique beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,LarryV,4.25,"Poured with a huge, dense tan head that slowly faded to an island of foam in the middle of the chalice. Nose is earthy, grassy, really quite hard to describe, but I didn't find any off putting aromas in the smell. Color is a murky amber not unlike a darker hefeweizen. Taste starts with a slightly sour note but then turns into a hoppy, dry finish. There are other Belgians I prefer, but this is a damn good beer. A bit expensive at $6 for a 11.2 oz bottle.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,DaPeculierDane,4.47,"Once upon a time I was not a fan of Orval but as my taste buds and olfactory glands have grown to appreciate and even crave sourness in beer they have also learned to love this fine trappist. For me the aroma of Orval is perfect. It is very difficult to describe. The aroma contains a wonderful sourness that is surprisingly not present in the taste. Within that sourness are hop oils, phenols, a perfumed fruitiness and bitterness, quinine, lemon grass, hay, and so much more that I cant place a finger on. Orvals body is light and about as dry as it gets. It is well hopped, slightly bitter, and tastes of medicinal light fruits and leather. I prefer most of the other trappist beers to Orval simply because I prefer quads, dubbels, and BSDAs to Pales, however, I believe that this is the quintessential example for the style. Its certainly the best Ive had.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,TrickKnee,2.65,"After hearing nothing but raves about the orval I decided to give it a go. I heard so many suggest ways to drink i.e. 50 degrees in a glass to bring out the flavors and many others. All i can say is that I was extremely unimpressed for the hype. The head looked almost like that froth that churns up on the sea shore and just stuck to the glass. Taste was not overly great either. For $5 a beer i would say spend a couple extra bucks and get a decent 6 pack, you will be much happier.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,timtheenchanta,3.28,"Darker golden color with large white head that doesn't hold too well. Nice lacing down the glass. Steady stream of carbonation rising up.  Belgian yeast, alcohol, and a barnyardish/horse smell funking it up make up the nose.  A little sour at first. Some alcohol and expected yeast flavor.  Little alcohol in the finish despite being in other parts of the drinking.  Overall a little disappointing. Probably my least favorite belgian pale to date.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,kmcnair,4.17,"Pours a hazy light brown to copper color and makes a pale tan crown that fades into an island of cloudy bubbles and a thin halo. Satiny lace clings to the sides of the Orval goblet. Aroma has a sour twang, earthy barnyard funk, horsey. Very unusual flavor, earthy hop bitterness, peppery spice and bread yeast, nearly no sweetness, funky lemon-like sour notes from the brettanomyces, has many saison qualities. Light to medium bodied, crisp intense carbonation, super clean dry finish. These monks make a tasty beverage, will definitely drink again.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Earthy and grassy citrus smells with slight caramel and raisin. Very earthy and grassy taste mixed with a decent amount of hop flavor and bitterness - although its an odd flavor, not off, but odd. It is different from the other Trappist ales I have tried. It seems a bit harsh. I have one more bottle tucked away that I will have to try in a year or two. Its not a bad flavored beer, I just think this bottle is still too young.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,allergictomacros,3.78,"A - Hazy copper with a big chunky head. Fades slowly to a 2 mm constant cover and a touch of lace on the chalice.  S - A touch of citrus in the nose, but dominated by ""horseblanket?"" - that characteristic smell. Reminds me a bit of dirty alley-ways. It's different anyway.  T - Quite dry. Grape-y,wine-y flavours and a mild bitterness. Lots of complexities in this... and a finish is dry and bitter. Has a unique flavour I can't really place that really comes out when it warms in the mouth. At bit of a sweet, fruitiness that comes with an astringency and maybe some tannins.  M - Very light, and a quickly dissipating bubbliness.  D - I don't think I could have too many of these. For me this is something to be savoured once in a while, and not more than one at a time.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Taste; the grass/hay qualities jump out at me at first as well as a bit of a funky earthiness. The mildly sweet honey flavors come out next, followed by a tartness that's a little drying in the finish with a bit of a hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium boded and creamy, and pretty easy to drink desite it's dry finish.  I didn't really care for this the first time I tried it, but I have come to enjoy Saisons and other similar styles over the last few years, so I figured I'd give it another shot.

Tastes surprizingly light..subtle yeast, horse blanket, malt....cidery; sour...not bitter, with some alcohol coming through. Dry and lighter in mouthfeel than I expected.Carbonation medium.

Aromas similiar to a heffe with some banana and clove, alcohol. Astringent on the tongue, has almost a soapy flavor. Alcohol also makes a strong presence in flavor, surprising for a lower ABV trappist. It's good to try another trappist, but I have to say this beer isn't doing much for me; much rather drink a NB Trippel or heffe.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Poured from the unique Orval bottle into an oversized wine glass. Cloudy amber colour with a big fluffy head that fades a little but sticks around for about half of the drink.  Smell is fruity and musty, with ""horseblanket"" elements and lots of farmy grains. Reminds me of good, stinky cheese. Cool!  Initial tastes are surprising and really hard to identify. As I keep drinking and it warms, I really get into this beer, but I still can't identify specific flavours. Sourish... fruit-like... ""wild""... barnyard. Definitely some aromas I remember from living on or near farms as a kid. An incredibily unique flavour. Perfect mouthfeel and a very pleasant aftertaste make this an extremely drinkable brew, even at its ABV level.

Smell: The aromas of bananas,cinnamon, maybe some clove and raison bread. No alcohol noted.  Taste: The flavors are sour fruits ,probably from the semi-wild yeasts that Orval uses, followed by an apricot dominance.Doesnt have that typical Belgian taste,but could be classified as a bad fruit beer.Seems a little tart in the finish.No alcohol to be detected.  Mouthfeel: This is very plain to me,a little sour in the front with a tart and bubbley finish.Medium carbonation,smooth,and easy to drink. But not memorable  Drinkability: I am very disappionted,I guess I expected this beer to be a superstar Belgian beer and yet was more like a fruit or hefewiezen gone wrong.Sorry Orval, just not my cup of tea.

Tastes of lemon, spices, alcohol, a little malty. lacking in taste. mouth feel is descent and the carbonation is very good. drinkablitly is alright, this beer would be easy to drink because of no real flavors presented either good nor bad.

Of course, I've become a big Belgian Sour Beer fan in the meantime. Pours a prune juice color with a rocky foamstand that varies between eggshell white and amber-tan, sprinkled with spices. Aromatics of sourness, tartness, muskiness, woodsy, metalic, and oysters. Flavors boarder closely on the characters in the aroma. Low levels of barley (maybe too low) lends an overly sour flavor and astringency. Not enough sweetness remains to balance out the tartness. Some DMS qualities come through that reminds me of an ocean muskiness or oyster flavor. Fascinating, but very raw. The beer is well matured and complex.

Pours reddish-golden color, clear. Smells floral, strong hop presence.  Taste is very dry, just a hint of floral notes after a very dry start. Not at all what I expected from the nose.

The aroma is somewhat complex, with ripe fruit (peach, plum, pear) blended with a distincly walnut aroma of the yeast.  The taste grows complex as the ale warms. The bready, nutty yeast flavors begin to dominate the fruit, and the alcohol begins to become evident. This is all complimented by a very phenolic - almost buttery - mouthfeel, with ample carbonation to offset the phenols.

It reminds me of Degobah, you know, where Yoda lives. The head is impressively thick though. The odour is intense. Citrus and barnyard. Ohhhh, how exciting! The taste follows the nose . . . but it is simply nowhere near the level of funkiness I was expecting. This is a nice, drinkable beer. I was looking for an over-the-top crazy beer. It sorta leaves me hanging, because I really like easily drinkable beers . . . but not at the price this guy is charging! Overall, it's just not hit-me-over-the-head wierd enough.

A little breadiness and lemony.  Appearance: Hazy, golden, orange with a white medium head with good retention. Appears very effervescent. A little hazy.  Flavor: Very bready malt flavor that gives way to a dry almost citrus rind flavor that lingers in the aftertaste. Some spiciness from what could be a resiny American hop. A little floral and rose petals.  Mouthfeel: A fine carbonic bite but the lemon rindish astringency detracts from what could be a smoother ale.  Overall: Nice aroma, but so much pithiness on the flavor. could age to become dry and citrusy.

It has a medium orange/red color and has a slight sediment that settles quickly. The smell only hints at the complex flavor that is hidden within. Each time I raise the glass to my nose, I get something new, lots of hay and other funky barnyard smells. The taste is dry with a flowery hop flavor that dominates the musty and yeasty undertones.

This particular example was bottled 3/10/04, and has been kept refrigerated ever since.  Orval comes out of the bottle a creamy, light red/bronze with an insane gushing head. The beer reaches a full 4"" above the glass rim with major cling and an odd set of yeast lips. Phenomenal in presentation.  Nose is strongly Brett-funked out; wood pulp, pepper, spices, rotting apples. Boozey pepper gets ground over tart, over-ripe cherries that are something akin to my conception of hops. Also slightly medicinal (band-aids).  Taste is initially peppery with barnyard funk that gets slowly filled in with the most delicious and soothing malts i've experienced; grainy bread and soaking biscuits in cider. Dry-hopping adds to already wicked dryness and drinkability.  I'd drink this by the gallon...if it didn't work out to be like $50 a gallon.

After letting it settle a bit I poured the rest of the bottle in my glass and took a look.  It had the color and consistancy of grapefruit juice. Just a beautiful looking beer. There were grape, sugar, and a champagne notes in the nose. I knew this was going to be a very complex beer and I had not even taken the first sip.  Taste: Champagne, grapefruit mixed in with a bit of spice and tartness that provided the beer with a slight kick. I said it before but this is not beer. It cannot be beer. But here it was.

The beer is light copper-orange in color with vigorous carbonation and some murkiness. S: The scent is somewhat difficult to characterize, along the lines of acidic, ripe pears and apples attached to a sweaty-saltiness that brings to mind beef jerky or tanned leather. T: Orval boasts an upfront burst of peppery and salty flavors (that I'm not terribly fond of) that cascades into a light, flowery hoppiness, eventually fading out with some mild malt sweetness and robust hop bitterness in the finish. The hops are not citrus-like, as in some other beers with noticeable hop presence. Aftertaste is somewhat malty and fruity, faintly like old berries on hot cereal. M: Light body with active carbonation leads to a 'fluffy' feel on the tongue. Dry, tart finish that is far from puckering, though. The dry finish does not necessarily lead one to desire another swig: the spicy-salty taste combination is somewhat off-putting.

It is almost an adhesive smell like carpet or apolstry, somehow it works though. From that description it sounds like it would be nauseating, but it isn't.  T - Gumball, bitterness, but it doesn't taste quite like a hoppy bitterness, a little peppery. It is a faint flavor all around.  M - Okay, it is smooth, slightly refreshing with a medium viscosity.  D - I liked Orval. Without the monster pricetag I'd probably buy it a lot more often. Went well with the moldy cheese I ate with it.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,TheEclecticGent,3.15,"Had the bottled version of this in a beer tasting event. It pours a creamy looking light caramel color with a good head and lacing. It has a musky nose. The flavor is a smooth fruity to fermented fruity flavor, maybe a hint of orange rind. It has an odd bitter finish to me. Something is missing in this beer, it seems a bit unbalanced to me. Not bad overall and I would drink it again especially with a good Belgian dish.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,asabreed,4.23,"33 cl. bottle poured into a tulip.  Appearance: Light brown color, with huge champagne-like bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. Huge head like ice cream that forms craters inside the glass as it dissipates, and huge clumps of lacing stick crazily.  Smell: Malt and and candy sugar, some peppery spice, citrus zest, flowers, big Belgian yeast, vinegar, fruitiness, and vanilla. Lots of stuff going on, and it gets better, of course, as it warms.  Taste: Not as balanced as I wanted it to be. The bitterness seems to be at the forefront way too much. It's yeasty, spicy, a bit fruity, but by the end it remains pretty hoppy or bitter for some reason. How much hops could be used here? Kind of weird to me in a way. But as it warms the complexity shows itself, as it gets moderately sweeter and fruity and lingers on the tongue. I just wish some of the aromas came out more in the taste better.  Mouthfeel: Slightly creamy, moderately medium in body, with a nice carbonation punch toward the end of the swallow to balance everything out.  Drinkability: I guess maybe I expected much more, considering it's a Trappist, and also that it's around $5 a bottle. Still really good, but I don't know if I'm going to be in a huge hurry to buy it again. Give it a shot, though. I'm glad I finally got to try it.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,filabrazilia,4.05,Pours a hazy pale orange with a thick billowy head that peaks over the rim of the glass like the mountains to the west. The off white head leaves nice lace on the glass.  There is a sour note to the aroma that is joined with citrus and spice.  The taste is tart and rich--like biting into a meaty lemon. Not a bad sensation. A touch of sweetness finishes the taste.  This is a remarkably smooth beer to drink. It is soft and pleasant in the mouth. It finishes dry and bitter but leaves me wanting more.  A nice beer that is worth trying again.,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,GClarkage,4.23,"12/31/05- Purchased at Weimax Liquors in Burlingame, CA.  Presentation- 11.2oz funky and cool shaped bottle. Bottled on and best by date on the neck of the label. Poured into my Duchesse chalice.  Appearance- Golden in color with a cloudy haze. Larger spritzy off white, maybe yellow in color looking full 3/4 inch head. Great lacing left behind as I drink the last drop in the glass.  Smell- Lots of sweet and sour spices with a barnyard type scent. A tad musky. Maybe some citrus notes such as lemon rind noted.  Taste- More sour than sweet. A really hefty amount of citrus with lemon rind being the foremost. White pepper and other spices fill the void with some powdered sugar to round out the sweetness.  Mouthfeel- Well carbonated...very Duvel-esque. Almost like a kind of champagne. Very puckering and drying.  Drinkability- Because of the carbonation level it's a tad less drinkable for me, but not because the flavor was bad. Orval brings back nice memories as it was the first Belgian beer I ever had back in 2002. I remember liking it then, but I don't remember it tasting like this. Guess my pallete has really grown from 3 years ago.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Erdinger2003,4.48,"Has a beautiful thick head that resonates a hoppy sweetness. Has a nice caramel color with hints of amber. A very strong lacing. Tastes hoppy, but without strong aftertaste. A new taste for me. Can't figure out quite what it is. My first thought was hints of raisan. Has a nice frothy feeling to it, with fruity undertones of lemon and orange.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Mandrake,5,"Pours a fairly dark cloudy orange, very warm and with glinting sunlight coming through. The head is massive, and so thick that it almost feels like cotton candy. Leaves incredible rocky lacing all over the sides of my chalice, and maintains a thick covering over the surface for as long as the beer lasts. Aroma is insanely complex. Subtly alcoholic, which surprised me given its fairly modest ABV. Spices and breads are the dominant aromas. Lots of fruits, ranging from the very dark (raisins and plums) through the light and delicate (apples and bananas), with citrus and gloriously rich sweet malts. Incredible. Tastes bready, musty notes of brett and wild yeast. Spicy as well, cloves and pepper in the mix, with lots of fruits (banana and orange are predominant) as well. Long and sour finish. Mouthfeel is very creamy and nicely carbonated. Full and very warming, superb. Drinkability was incredible for a trappist. I wanted to keep drinking these all night. Nothing warms me up quite as well on a snowy night as Orval does. Gets better every time I have it, and is now one of my absolute favourite beers of all time. Flawless.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,descartes,3.63,"Poured from a 33 cl. bottle.  Appearance: Deep amber with a nice half inch head. Smell: Very spicey and grainy smell. Taste: First one gets a slight honey flavor followed by malts and then a overpoweringly bitter taste. Mouthfeel: A bit over cardinated, moderate body. Drinkability: Just too bitter, I cann't see myself downing two of these in a row.  Overall: As I stated above this beer was just too strong and bitter, which was surprising considering how sweet it smelled. Maybe giving it a couple of years in the cellar would have mellowed it out and made it more enjoyable.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Mindsquall,3.88,"Pours a nice deep amber with little head and a little lacing. Smell is aromatic, smells like Oregano, interesting. Taste is smooth, little bitterness and an aroma of cloves. Mouthfeel is not too bad, a little alcoholic but still goes down alright. It's not something you want to take big gulps from, but it isn't too bad and is worth having again.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

When in the mood, an Orval is fantastic.  5 December 2005, Best Before Feb 08  Appears a murky orange brown colour with a foamy head and large bubbles. Aroma of cooked vegetables and spices, particularly nutmeg, some medicinal type aromas there too. Rather strange flavour, celery possibly, very complex. The vegetables, nutmeg and also five spice come to mind. But it's also fresh, hoppy, perfumy and a little salty. Fairly high carbonation, but not too much at this alcohol level and temperature. Overall quite an unusual taste, one is enough for me.

37,129,masikon,4.47,"Poured into an Orval chalice this was a gorgeous cider-like hazy burnt orange with an outstanding chunky white head which laced like crazy. Smell was unbelievable, absolutely mouth watering with a range of notes from bananas, freshly cut grass, generic citrus, and yogurt? (lol) anyways, really a beer that I would actually refer to as having a true bouquet. Flavors are refreshing and spicy, full of flowery suggestions, yeasty bananas, and plenty of orange peel. Delicious and classic, the only thing that holds down the drinkability is that I want to drink it faster than my wallet can buy it.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

M: fresh from the bottle just awesome, as it warms its losing some of the carbo prick and some of its energy. I prefer it a little colder to create that really bouncy, coating, chewy mouthfeel.

However it is overwhelmed by a strange medicine like smell. I've never encountered anything quite like this.  Taste is strongly of spices - pepper, cloves, and possibly corriander. Very carbonated. Slight hop flavor in the finish. These flavors are also overwhelmed by a cough medicine flavor. Maybe this brew is an aquired taste. Maybe this is a skunk beer. I normally enjoy belgium pale ales, but there is something wrong here.  Mouthfeel is light and very carbonated.  I need to try another Orval to see if this is the way it is supposed to taste. I had great expectations but this brew certainly didn't meet it.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Tastes spicy (indefinite), with bready malts, dull lemony citrus rind, and a biting yeast finish. Alcohol comes through solidly, too. Juicy carbonated mouthfeel, but quite dry overall. Very nice. Easy-drinkin' Trappist ale...can I actually say that?",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,SacoDeToro,4.29,"The beer pours a burnt orange hue. The carbonation is high and the beer kicks up a tall foamy white head. The aroma is full of grassy noble hops and some yeastiness. The malt profile is that of a pale ale laced with flavors of burnt sugar and toffee. The hop bitterness is intense but finishes very clean with almost no aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good, but the high carbonation thins things out a little more than I'd like.  Overall a very flavorful beer with a unique hop charater to boot.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Lots of retention and incredible lacing! (Enough to make some stouts jealous)! Exceptional. Perfect.  S: Some nice bready malt and caramelized sugar, along with a little solvent-like aroma of fresh hops. Only a hint of fruit (appricot?).  T: The balance is slightly bitter, but it's crisp, and not at all harsh. There's a little chewy, bready malt. Hints of fruit, a little citrousy, smooth hop flavour, with a crisp, slightly tart aftertaste (with that horse/leather quality). The alcohol is very subdued, not assertive at all. Brilliantly unique.  M: Light to moderate body, moderately high carbonation.  D: Awesome. Nothing is overwhelming, so it's easily approachable, but there's enough complexity to keep the taste buds amused.

37,129,orbitalr0x,4.54,"Bottled on 24-10-2002, making this one a bit over 3 years old! The Orval Trappist Ale pours into my big Orval chalice a nice amber brown hue with streaks of orange as well. A tight bubbly white head lingers atop the brew in a fine fashion. Looks lovely in the glass. Aromas are intensely unqiue and perplexing at the same time. Sweet caramel spice smacks up against a musty, yeasty earthiness. A touch of leather mingles with some cotton candy/bubblegum aromas. Fruity with a touch of sour cherry, cinnamon and brown sugar. Maybe even a bit woody but definetly enchanting with each inhalation evoking new scents in my mind.  First sip brings a crisp, dry spicy caramel infused with a plethora of flavors that dash across the palate on the trip down the throat. Hints of leather and wood along with some musty sour funkiness that brings images of a cobweb filled brewery to my mind. Light fruit notes collide with brown sugar bubblegum. Spice cake. Lots of earthy yeast notes throughout. Quite the complex beer here. Finishes dry and crisp. Eccentric and ultimately a wonderful experience.  Mouthfeel features a burst of champagne-esque carbonation that streaks across the mouth with each sip. A mellow medium body allows for easy drinking but maybe the bubbles could be toned down a tad. Drinkability is really quite wonderful as it goes down smooth and each sip brings a new realm of taste sensations. I would not mind seeing this in 750ml bottles! Purchased this pre-cellared for me at Liquor Stop in Highland, IN...didn't even look at the date when I bought it. I will be on the lookout for a fresh bottle to try in the near future. Another testament to the wonders of the Trappist breweries of Belgium. This will go down as one of my new favorites.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Litterbean,4,"This is a very unique brew, in my eyes. Pours a golden amber orange into a chalice which produces a lot of bubbly head. Bits cling to the sides and the white cap remains throughout the entire lifespan of the brew.  Upon agitating the beer, my nose is met with an array of stimuli. There's a very, very tart scent to this beer. I want to say it is reminiscent of a sharp cheese. Fruit smells are also abundant, most prominently is the apple cider undertones.  The taste is something else that I'm not entirely used to. I am trying to judge this though based on its merits and its compliance with the style, and even if I've never had a beer that is complex in the ways that this is, it is still spectacular. Bittersweet tartness all the way through. The yeast really makes this a puckering beer. To balance that out is the ample amounts of maltiness that lay below. Flavors of grapefruit and grapes, plus a lot of that apple cider character that was noted in the smell. Very tasty, and juicy, if that is any way to describe a beer.  A lot of carbonation in this one, which I guess can explain the juiciness as each sip refreshes the tongue. As far as drinkability, this one is good, although the high price for 11.2 ounces of the stuff will probably steer me away unless it's a real special occasion. Judging it based soley on the liquid itself, it is highly drinkable and a real treat.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

As the head settles, it kinda looks like a topographic map of Yosemite national park leaving behind a nice lace. There are a steady hail of bubbles rising for the bottom of my glass.  Smells of cantaloupe, honey, marshmallows, black pepper and grapefruit.  The flavor is very dry and sour like grapefruit with this particular flavor amplifying on the finish. There is also a subtle apple, cherry and raisin sweetness here. Unfortunately, the sour dominates and almost feels electric along the sides of my tongue.  The mouth feel is very full and pleasantly carbonated.  This beer is fantastic, right up until the flavor. Too bad.  I found it interesting that pouring the remainder of sediment in the bottom of the bottle into my glass really rounded out the flavor.

Snap, Crackle, and Pop got nothin on this brewmaybe sound should be a reviewable category as well, since I can hear the fizz like no other just as I tilt the glass towards my lips. This is about as dry a beer as Ive ever tastedclean and appetizingly so. Tart, hoppy, and drinkable as hell. This beer as a singular uniqueness that separates it from the rest of beerdomI figure either you like it or you dont. I freakin like it, and maybe the ultimate aperitif.  Now the last quarter-inchthe yeasties; as the Orval website says one should taste the sediment of the beer separately. OK, there are some thing monks know bestand beer is damn sure one of em.

The aroma is extremely pleasant. Fruity with the mild horse-blanket tones being the quiet feature of the nose.  Taste is pretty dry with the wild yeast taking the spotlight in both the fore and after tastes. The after taste lasts a little too long for me with a high, thin flavor.  Mouthfeel started off over-carbonated for me but after a brief warmup and sit, settles down nicely.

Smells perfumy/vinous with rubber glove phenols, cough medicine, and some lemon juice. First sip throws me for a loop. Tastes like a rubber glove. It's like I'm at the dentist. The next flavor is cough medicine, like Robitussin or something, and maybe other medicinal flavors. That's pretty much all I can detect. Maybe some perfumy hops. It loses a lot of flavor toward the end. The strong phenols may be the intent of those monks, but they rub me the wrong way and really affect the drinkability of the beer. I was looking forward to trying this one, but am disappointed. I'll try again sometime to see if it will taste different.

Aromas of herbs and spices, with some malt in the background. Taste was decent, but far from what I've come to expect from a Belgian Pale Ale. Flavors of hay, bitter malt and hops, grain and alcohol fill the palate. Somewhat of a bland character as well... can't put my finger on it. Mouthfeel was smooth and rather creamy.

Taste is medicinal and metalic. Some earthy/woodsy things goin on, kinda herbaly, but mostly a sour, metal thing. Light sweetness balances out things enough to make it a bit more drinkable. But I feel like I'm drinking a spoon. Too young, this bottle may be...  Mouthfeel is sudsy, very soapy. Full of bubblyness. Fairly drinkable, but... I don't know.

In the mouth, it's very dry, hard to perceive the flavors initially past the bubbly carbonation; there's a slight sourness, with mineral, bittering hops, and a tart, gum-like fruitiness. It's light in the mouth, more so than other Belgians I've tried.

Nose still is sour apples and barnyard, very funky and saison like-4.25. Taste follows the nose where the pale malt base has gotten a tad stronger over the years.

A killer head of sudsy topped froth puffs up and stays with unbelievable retention. Delicate crusty lace is left in it's wake. A pure delight to witness.  Aromas are interesting for a BPA, showing soft floral fields of fruit, highlighting bruised white grapes, grapefruit, and pinapple. Soft and musty, with traces of minerality and crushed rocks.  The flavor opens up with dry grape, pinapple, and apple. There's a beautifully delicate floral note that carries through to tart fruit laced cellar must. It's sweetly perfumed with spice and drying minerality. There's a hefty hop finish that is both unexpected and welcome. It's almost orangey and spicey at the same time, a Belgian Amarillo?  Body is between light and medium, alive with soft effervescence, and has a crisp, fluffy mouthfeel. Very drinkable.

37,129,jamesdergen,3.25,"Appearance: Pours a hazy iced tea with a small, fizzy white head that dissipates quickly. Somewhat disappointing.  Smell: Hints of vanilla and maybe caramel and definitely some sour apple aromas. One of very few beers where I can really smell the alcohol.  Taste: Some sour notes, similar to green apples. The Belgian yeast flavors really come through in the middle and lead into a fizzy alcohol/white grape finish.  Mouthfeel: Very fizzy, which really bothered me initially, but wasn't as distracting towards the end. Very light bodied and doesn't really leave an aftertaste.  Drinkability: I wouldn't go past one bottle of Orval. It's isn't very heavy, but it's a sipper for me and the fizziness is a bit much.

Second is swirled to pick up sediment.  Decent off white head that disapates quick with a bit of lacing. Smells of fruity sourness. First half glass: bitter taste, maybe some biscut not much else. Last gulp was a big with which revealed this not to be a sipping brew. Taste included a strong alcohol presents accompanied with some fruitiness.  Second half poured very cloudy orange. Turning out to be a stronger flavored brew. With more of a spicey fruit smell.  Notes: towards the end of the second glass I started eating some tater-tots and some store brought meat balls. This proved to be a good move cause it showed me how well this brew can go with foods.

Smell is of banannas and bubble- gum with some slight spice and orange. Taste is really nice- again, spicy, herbal, with slight undertones of pepper and orange. Stays in the throat and persists for awhile, changing all the way. Quite dry and refreshing; Amazing with food- the dry crisp acidity of it cuts through even rich and spicy foods; and it tastes even richer with food. Easy to drink it; really lovely.  Overall, another world- class trappist. Those that don't love it just need to have it with food- that's when it really shines.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,mortarit,3.56,"Well us North Carolina tasters are experiencing a new frontier with the bar lifted. I saw this bottle at total wine on my way from work so I grab it. The shape of the bottle grab me. The pour was manageable without to much head retention, about an inch and a half I say. I notice that the pour was murky and looking at it after the pour that is cloudy. It darken at the widen spaces that the class gives it. It does have lacing forming around the edges. The taste isn't over powering which I like. For begin the first trappist ale, I would say not to bad.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,murrayswine,4.24,"Thanks to Biglove or the trade, very awesome guy. I poured this one into my Delirium tulip.  The pour is perfect with a full cotton head. The smell presents esters, oily chocalate, rose, citrus and raisins. The taste is wonderful, light and complex with chocalate, and cherries and walnuts coming through. The mouthfeel is awesome, light and smooth. If you have the means, I highly recommend it.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,mntlover,4.23,"Pours a beautiful hazy dark peach color some bubbles rising to feed a creamy fluffy massive head restin on top of this baby. Looks oh so tasty.  Aroma is fruity pear, grapes, tangerines and bananas mixed with spice on a bready malt background, soothing soft aroma.  Taste is wow big not soft like the smell. Lots of carbonation from the start gives the malt and fruit a kick in the pants so to speak. Nice and fruity malt finishes with some good peppery spice, clove and some herbal hops lend some bitterness and the yeast add some earthy dirt like flavors in the finish also. This is a nice Belgian Pale Ale one of the better ones that I have had.  Mouthfeel is good almost medium, almost creamy, the nice zesty carbonation gives the flavors an added boost.  Drinkability is good enjoyed this one more then normal.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,SupaCelt,3.7,"This brew presented itself at nearly a year old as a hazed copper orange with a monstrous chunky head. It is extremely bubbly and the head holds strong and produces sheets of lacing with some true substance.  The smell is very nice to the nose. Banana comes through as dominant to my detectors. A bit of ground spice and pepper and other fruity impressions linger as well.  The taste is light and subtle. The banana that was evident in the nose is noticeable as well as a pear impression and the tastefully administered spicery. There is a degree of bitterness here that shows up in the final throes along with a sourness. It has quite a bit of yeast inspired flavor character. The aftertaste comes off too peppery and yeasty for my personal preferences.  The mouthfeel is light. Massive carbonation achieves this effect quite handily.  Drinkability is only as good as taste here. I was truly optimistic about this, but overall I am a bit disappointed in the end. I was expecting more out of this one.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

S- The perfumed smell of orange, pear and a hint of banana are mixed with a slight white wine nose. Some soft pale malt notes are also in the smell.  T- Very light fruit and soft malt flavor with a hint of bitterness in a dry finish. This has a little bit of young mead in the finish.  M- This beer has a creamy mouthfeel with a bit of a fizziness to it.  D-This is a very soft yet complex beer that has a lot of nice flavors. However some of the flavors that are not as pleasant tend to shine through more that I would like.

37,129,jhu1995,3.36,"Poured from an 11.2 oz bottle.  Loved the color and appearance of this beer. Nice orange color with plenty of head retention. Lots of tiny bubbles exploding to the surface. Very fruity smell, almost like a chardonnay. Couldn't wait to taste it. Taste was okay, but was expecting more based on appearance and smell. Not very complex and nothing that really makes you stand up and take notice. Mouthfeel was interesting. Felt very foamy, almost like it was forming a head in my mouth. Overall, a decent beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,mjohn27603,4.42,Pours almost clear in appearance. Leaving a high foamy head. 4 fingers worth in the glass with big bubbles of carbonation. ARoma of grape juice and fruityness with clean crisp smell. Second pours reveals a more golden apperance but stiill with transperancy. A slight hint of orange and grape flavor. Kind of like champagne beer. A very light and crisp taste. Flavor is like a knife to the palate. Extremely drinkable.,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,unklesyd,3.55,"After all I'd heard about this beer, I was pretty disappointed, especially at the price.  Poured like a typical Belg. Pale, big head, lots of retention. Interesting color change when the last 1/3 of the bottle was swirled and yeast added.  Subdued fruity, earthy nose.  The taste was very earthy as well. Very low hop flavor, but great balance and bitterness. Very woody. Before sediment was added, the woodiness was crisper and snappier; after, it became more subtle in its character and brought out a hint of licorice.  After finishing this bottle, I didn't want another. The weight of the beer combined with its flavor profile was too heavy, although the balance was excellent.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,ReebShorts,5,"11 oz. bottle, Poured into oversize wine glass. Darkish Orange color, frothy head that settled into a thin white top layer. It looks good.  Wow, there is some stuff going on here. First thing is flowers, like a boquet of wildflowers, there is some fruit present here too, maybe plum and apricot... i need to taste and find out what's going on here.  Oh my, never had anything quite like this, strong spicy flower taste, like I just drank some potpourri mix. Not bad though, the initial flavor is quelled by an abundance of carbonation, and some spicy hops. This is actually getting better with every drink, this is really good. I wish a had a couple more, but at $5.50 per 11 oz bottle I'll have to pace myself on these.  Mouthfeel is excellent,thhere is quite a bit of fizzy carbonation present but is is fine and easy to deal with, plus necessary to cut through the power of the flower.  Edit: ok, i've had a chance to drink this one several more times, and was trying to be somewhat conservative in my early reviews. But I simply love this beer, and see no reason to not give it perfect marks. Wish I had one right now....",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Very good beer!,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,danielharper,3.75,"Purchased from Woody's Smokes and Brews, Franklin, TN.  I had a taste of this at the Bring-a-Friend Beer Tasting in Birmingham a few weeks back, but not enough for a full review. Bought a single bottle and poured it into my oversized wine glass. Appearance is really quite nice, with a sort of orange-yellow body covered with one of the thickest off-white foamy heads I've ever seen. I didn't even pour that aggressively, and this thing just took off. Almost too much head since I'm having to dribble the remainder of the brew into the glass a little bit at a time.  Aroma is very sweet, with hints of soft honey and possibly even a hint of cinnamon. Fascinating the way these Belgian Ales seem to produce the strangest scents that have nothing to do with barley, malt, and hops, but when it smells this nice I'm not complaining.  I may have let this warm a bit too long, for the beer has a strongly astringent flavor first and foremost, which only later softens into a nice soft sweetness that coats the mouth and the tongue. Alcohol is quite strong here, present in large quantities in the flavor even if not in the nose. Bitterness follows every swallow, but it's a nice sort of non-hoppy bitterness. Enjoyable but not exactly to my taste.  This has a thick and luxurious mouthfeel and a low carbonation that work together nicely. The bitter flavors make me not really want to swish this around a lot when drinking it, but the mouthfeel doesn't stand in the way of drinking it that way.  This beer tastes good, and it's fairly low alcohol for a Trappist, but I find myself actually wanting to finish this bottle and move on to something else. I'll certainly try it again next time I can get ahold of it, and this time I'll open it up when it's a few degrees cooler, but at this temperature I really don't enjoy it as much as I'd like to. North Coast Pranqster is much better, and much cheaper.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,DogFood11,4.95,"This is my lucky day....after putting this beer aside in my fridge for over a month (massive willpower) I pulled it out for the sunday night baseball game and it didn't dissapoint.  Beautiful thick chunky head that falls to a solid blanket coating. Mmmm. spritzy carbonation.  At first I thought I was in a flower shop. potpouri type smells but very complex. just imagine about 100 selected varieties of flowers all in one room and that is the smell. Pleasant but powerful. Tasted the same...potpouri with some kick ass mouthfeel (sizzles to make its point but overall smooth). Wild yeast, almost lambic like, with some drying in the middle.  One of the only knocks I could have on this beer is the carbonation is a bit spritzy...some may like it that way. I wish it was toned down just one level and it would have gotten 5's",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,SkeeterHawk,4.37,"Appearance: Pretty cloudy Orangish copper color at first pour with an extremely thick dense head at first pour. This head turned into bigger bubbles and fell within a couple minutes or so. There is a whole bunch of thick Belgian lace left in its wake.  Aroma: At first pour, I get all kinds of fruit in the aroma. You can definitely make out Lemons, Grapefruits, Pears, and I would even be so bold as to say that I can pick out Limes in this beer. As it warms, you can pick out a bit of the malt mixed with cherries, but the citrus still rules.  Taste: The taste is really citrusy as the nose suggests, but there is also a caramel component that I didnt get in the aroma. The taste starts out with a complex meld of fruit and malt, but the flavor takes on many facets before it finally calms down. The finish is amazingly dry and refreshing. I believe that this may have to do with the attenuation and mouthfeel as much as anything. I dont pick up enough hops in here to actually balance the malt, but the high attenuation makes it come across as almost balanced toward the bitter.  Opinion: All I can really say is WOW! This beer is really amazing! I have had it on multiple occasions, but that was after quite a few beers. As my first beer of the evening, it really shines. There is a really complex flavor and aroma profile that is not done justice after you have already had something else to drink. This is one world class beer that you have to try all by itself to really appreciate. Excellent beer! I highly recommend it!",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Aroma: Bananas and some citrus notes. Yeast reasserts its presence, and floral notes are in the air too.  Taste: Heavy carbonation and sweet sourness make the toungue tingle with delight. Hops balance sweetness so nicely. This ale goes down smooth and crisp. Easy to drink, yet full of flavor. Light to medium body. Every sip is a pleasure in its own.

37,129,theozag,3.87,"Please pardon the brevity of this review, I am attempting to catch up (between work assignments) from weeks of tasting based on notes...  I bought this beer on a whim from my local military package store and I was delighted to realize I'd struck beer-drinking gold with my flight of fancy.  This beer has heavy clouding in its body but no sediments; very thick white head that lasts for several minutes; caramel-colored body with brown whisps throughout  Smell is absolutely outstanding: a sugary-sweet, fruity blend of aromas that is complimentary to the rest of the beer and very clean and crisp.  Flavors I found much harder to describe as virtually of this beer's character revealed itself to me just as I began to swallow each mouthful.  Start is imperceptible and light; settles full-boided with limited bitter flavors; finishes with a strong hop bitterness that comes out from behind a soft malty cushion.

37,129,malty,4.58,"Bottled on Nov. 2003  Poured into its namesake goblet a brilliant copper orange with a billowing dusty beige head that settled down to a dense 1/4"" with visible carbonation streaks bubbling upward.  The scent of this one is truly a fantastic mysterious myriad (somebody stop me) of components: FRESH citrus/flowery hops. Hand squeezed lime. That familiar scent of ripe queen green olives.  Flavor: Where do I start...The scent is very indicative of the tongue treat to follow. Tart, tangy & dry. Very citrusy with substantial malt softness to provide perfect balance. Yeasty esters are prevalent that are even somewhat dusty tasting. Cloves wrapped around tart lemons. Fantastic chalky dryness weaves in-and-out of some kind of spice that reminds me of autumn (not allspice though). I'll have to drink a few more to nail it (twist my arm if you have to).  Mouthfeel: Are you kidding me? Imagine a tempurpedic memory foam mattress... Now equate that to mouthfeel. 'Nuf said.  Drinkability: For me, more and more please! For the next guy, maybe not as much - who knows? Locate a keg and I'll walk, swim, cycle or crawl for it.  Overall: I guess by now you know I loved this ale. Love is a word carelessly abused and overused. I truly love this beer. Now I know why it's known for one name, and one name only: 'Orval'. Worth every penny.

37,129,99bottles,4.12,"I can't believe I missed reviewing this. I've had this quite a few times, but when I found it in Milan for the equivalent of $1.85 a bottle I stocked up.  Ok, so Orval is a deep orange brown color, slighty cloudy with a clumpy yellowish off white head and above average carbonation. The smell is really unique; strong citrus rind, some wildflowers, and some sharp medicinal cuts. The taste is much of the same, only more complex. When young, as all these bottles are, it has a real biting astringency of phenols, phenols, and more phenols. The hops add good bitterness to the finish, and the malt seems lost in a sea of fighting flavors. The lemon and orange of the smell is in there, as is some funk, almost akin to a lambic. But, really...it's all phenols at first.  I've had quite a few that were left to age, and that made the voyage across the Atlantic and found them to be much more sweet and aromatic. The sweetness of honey, wild grasses, and jasmine all come out as the medicinal taste subsides over time. I like that the ""drink before"" date is a full 5 years after the""bottled on"" date. A really excellent choice, but try to catch one on the back end of those 5 years.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,PorterLambic,2.65,"Nice bottle. Pours a cloudy reddish-orange with a smallish creamy head. Smell is malt, green apple, oak, hops & yeast. Taste is hops, hops, hops and malt. Not at all what I expected. Mouthfeel: high carbonation, a bit rougher/hoppier than expected although I was forewarned about that. A very dry finish, by far the driest of any ale I've ever had, drier than almost any lager for that matter..

The nose has a fishy, fresh cut flowers mixed with shit sort of smell.  The taste is dry, bone dry, extremely dry. Sort of an oily, fishy, salty phenol and yeast taste. Hints at other trappist ales but is extremely unique. A HUGE carbonation. Touches of leather or shoe polish even. What a weird myriad of flavors. Hop bitterness is quite interesting. It flows from nothing to a little to this long big hop finish. The hop flavor is a strong earthy, extremely intense but not muted, citrus peel. Theres not your average American IPA sort of citrus touch. This is a very muted but much much more intense at the same time.  What a crazy tasting beer. Seriously I dont know what to say, the most unique beer of the trappist family, a must try for certain.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,swid,4.19,"33cL bottle; 6.9% ABV listed on label.  Orval pours a hazy-brown color into my tulip class. A large, off-white head forms, containing large bubbles; it slowly collapses in upon itself. Moderate carbonation and lacing. The aromas given off by this beer are quite complex; there's cloves, lemons, a hint of pine, and some unidentifiable funky aroma (it's funky in the very best way, however). Very balanced.  This is one smooth beer. An almost candy-like sweetness is evident when it first hits the front of your tongue. A balanced hop bitterness comes along shortly afterwards. There's a noticeable clove flavor present. This beer is quite full-bodied and is somewhat tart. The alcohol is just perceptable in the aftertaste, which is mildly sour.  This is a funky beer, but if you've become acclimated to sharper-tasting beer, it's very enjoyable. I recommend it.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Smell: Can pick up spices and grassy, herbal hop aromas. Hints of fruit and maybe a slight alcohol smell that lingers as well. Nothing too spectacular here.  Taste: More citrousy in the taste than I would have expected after smelling it. Somewhat complex flavors, but all very subtle. I even let this puppy warm up to nearly room temp. after I had finished half the bottle, and it didn't help much. Doesn't taste bad, I've just come to expect more from Trappists (and beer in general).  Mouthfeel: Little too carbonated for my taste. Lively in the mouth due to the carbonation, which carries the flavors well.  Drinkability: Personally, if I spend nearly $5 on a trappist, I want a higher abv..this ""tame"" trappist pale ale at 6.2% is a lightweight compared to it's relatives.

It pours nicely with a lingering head at 49 degrees from my cellar. I finger tall thin bubbled head that lingers appears. Strong lacing on the sides. A very pretty color of amber with tiny bubbles floating upward.  This smell doesn't really give me a hint a what is to follow -- maybe the allergies aren't cooperating.  The first sip is shocking -- quite a bit of alcohol here -- I didn't expect it. There seems to no hopps and not much malt either. Not quite sure what I'm drinking here. It has a bit a of a twang and sourness that I'm not entirely comfortable with.  Mouthfeel is somewhat flat from a carbonation standpoint. Not heavy or light, but medium swill.  I am very disappointed by this beer. It looks like a winner! The bottle is gorgeous. It pours wonderfully, with a sexy head the lingers -- nice lacing. But, I'm drinking beer for taste -- the looks are just part of the package. Without a doubt this is my least favorite Trippist to date.

Thankfully it tasted better that the tough smell, in fact its taste improved as I drank the glass. Delighted to finally taste this beer, it is a fairly complex beer for connoiseurs.

Lots of carbonation seen in my glass, I think the etching in the bottom of this Chimay glass enhances it? Swirled it in the bottle, I want that yeast.  S: Fruity aromas, hints of cinnamon sugar. Lots of spicy hop aromas. Soft lemony/zesty aromas. Nice.  T: Zingy hop flavors up front, not bitter though. Fruity citrus tastes. Flavors are surprisingly light and dare I say fluffy? Nice base of malts to bring this one home. Definitely enhanced by the chunk of yummy cheese I'm eating with this.

Taste...well...the first disappointment. Dry then bitter, overwhelming anything else that might be present.

Smell is very muted to me with just some just some light pepper and licorice. Good but not too complex or substantial.  Taste hits with a sharp acid zing that fades into pepper and a rich breadiness. A bitter hoppy palate cleaning aftertaste finishes this one off. A food beer if I ever tasted one. This one screams for cheese and meat in my opinion. I almost feel ashamed that I am drinking this without food.  Mouthfeel is good, but there is a sharpness there that is a bit much for me. A zingy prick that is just noticeabley too much.

Flavor is very complex, with sweet sweet maltiness, puckering tartness, peppery spices, and a dry hoppy bitterness all coexisting.

Nose is of ripe apples with a beautiful yeasty backdrop.  Soft effervescent entry is followed by a slow build-up of palate pleasing sweetness at midtaste. Flavor is complex with hints of raisens & green apples mixing with an earthiness which becomes addicting midway through a 10 oz. tulip.

Smell is barnyard and candy, lots of sweet farm aroma. Taste is spices (cloves?) and more farmhouse flavors with some candy sweetness and hops. This is complex and my palate language is inadequate to the task. Mouthfeel is full and there is some crispness toward the end. While this is not a session beer by any means it is easy to consume despite the complexity. Every now and then when working out you have to check your one rep max. Orval is an analogous experience.

Poured gently (I highly recommend a gentle pour!) into my beloved Duvel tulip glass. Murky brassy color over which blossomed a massively frothy light cream colored head. Very slowly the head dissapated, leaving wads of lace behind. The smell had elements of lambic and Flanders red to it. Brett yeast is evident in the musty, earthy, old-cat-piss-in-the-litterbox aroma. Definitely gives the nose a tweak. Also has some sour cherry and Band-Aid phenolics. Some doughy malt and lemon peel aroma, too. Light alcohol scent. Candy sugar sweetness welded to sour cherry up front. Lemon cough drops and an earthy malt taste. Definite brett influence as a slightly puckery leathery stale wet hay flavor becomes prominent. Bitterness of lemon zest and peppery spice complete the taste parade. Rather highly acidic. The feel was light, big-time spritzy, and drying. Not sure I really care for Orval. Definitely an acquired taste, IMO, and I like the sharp tartness of a lambic or Flanders red or the sharp bite of Brettanomyces. It just doesn't seem to work well with this beer. Maybe I'll age one a couple years and see what happens. But for now, I'm ambivalent at best about Orval.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,weeare138,3.88,"Appears as a hazy light gold with a 1 finger head and slight lacing. Mild carbonation coming through. Smells of lemony citrus, pine, ginger, and cloves. Tastes slightly sour(from the brett addition) with a citrus hop & diet gingerale type taste that seems to be hiding the mild malt buried in this brew. The mouthfeel is fizzy and stays mainly on the front of the tongue. It seems very dry too. Reminds me of a champagne for some reason. It seems like the alcohol is just present in this one and the abv is only 6.2%. On a note, I will say that this particular style is not one of my favorites but it is what it is. For me, I'm doing a one and done with an Orval in hand for the night. Overall, it's not bad though.  Finger licking good.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,GuinnessSmurf,3.64,"This was the feature beer for my 2005 tasting ""Trapped in Kansas City"". It proved to be the most interesting, but not the most enjoyable.  Appearance: Pours a golden orange color with really good head retention. It clings on the glass insistently.  Smell: The smell is very complicated. I got notes of hops, and some very intense herbs (corriander, rosemary, sage) as well as an over all sweetness.  Taste: The flavor is pretty clean in the onset then changes to a strange herbal bitterness. It was a flavor I was not prepared for. The aftertaste lasts for a long time - so if you like the flavor, you get to absorb it for a long time after the sip.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,palma,2.94,Light copper body with a large rocky off-white head. Aroma is sweet malt. Spicy with clove and cinnamon standing out. A phenolic band-aid like aroma cannot be missed. Taste is tart and bitter upfront. Phenolic flavors are present throughout. A rubber-like flavor which is not enticing. A nice peppery spiciness towards the end. Finishes dry and clean. Light bubbly carbonation. Medicine-like phenols were very persistent in the aroma and taste of this brew. A little too much for my liking. I could barely finish the bottle.,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,MrSeth,4.6,"Poured with a huge tan head. I always have a little trouble fitting one of these little bottles into glasses that technically should hold all of the contents. Not just lace, but foam clings to the glass. The nose has a very unusual citrusy quality, strange I guess because it also smells somewhat like sour apple all at once. The malt is way beneath this citrus and pungence in the profile. The taste is different than what the nose suggests.. a warming, lightly bready malt body, citrusy at the end with a slight aftertaste which is alot like the original taste. Orval has a very versatile profile so the food pairings for this ale are almost infinite.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,GCBrewingCo,4.28,"The beer poured in the Duvel glass clear medium amber with a white, tall, moussy and frothy head which coated the glass.  The aroma was earthy with a farmhouse yeast presence of brett. The aroma was fruity with light maltiness. The fruit aroma was most notably pineapple and slight candy aromas.  The flavor was very earthy in both hop bittering and hop flavor. The balance of the beer was decidedly toward bittering, but the malt presence kept the bittering in check. The malt flavor was slight caramel and was present in the background. The flavor became more fruity as the beer warmed and the brett character emerges.  The finish was dry with a slight spice and earthy flavors lasting long into the aftertaste. The body was medium and well done. The beer was highly drinkable, but their was an alcohol presence despite being less than 7% abv (the bottle said 6.9%).   11.2 ounce bottle. Bottled on 07.10.2004, best before 07.10.2009.

37,129,TongoRad,4.97,"Bottle dated 2-23-06  Slightly hazy pale copper color with an incredible rocky head.  Wonderful bouquet of fruit (tangerine, pineapple), caramel, and cotton candy (from candi sugar, I'm sure), and some spicy elements (juniper) in the background. You almost pick up something different with each sniff. There is an overall yeasty/bready/musky quality that is quite inviting.  Full flavored yet dry and quenchingly tart. This beer can withstand a high level of carbonation and not miss a beat. The feel of the bubbles suddenly expanding and then immediately dissipating in the mouth is quite remarkable. Most of the flavor is in the lingering finish- first caramel, then spice, then bread and yeast. Alcohol and bitterness are exactly where they should be and only begin to show themselves at the end of the glass.  It is amazing that a beer can be this full flavored and complex yet delicate and subtle at the same time.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,GreatLeo,4.35,Came in a 33cl bottle with bottled date of 09/28/2004 and best before date of 09/28/2009 served in its traditional glass.  Its a very unique beer quite distinct from all the other belgian pale ales out there I've tried. The color was a dark coppery color with a very generous head when poured. Definately not one of the strongest pale ales (6.2%) but its got quite a strong taste to it.  The taste was quite bitter especially the aftertaste it left behind which makes this belgian classic a bit more difficult to consume large amounts of. But still overall its a great trappist beer which I would recommend to all especially those who like bitter beers.,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,movingshadow152,4.22,"Presented in an 11.2 oz bottle, dated 1/6/04. Pouring this beer produces an impressive rocky head with very small bubbles, lacing nicely as it recedes. The beer was served well below proper temperature, and it still produces an amazing pile of foam. The color is golden orange, similar to honey.  The aroma is almost as good as the taste! I have trouble digesting the complex smells, but there are definite floral notes as well as some citrus (lemon) hints. There are sweet smells similar to honey.  The taste is wonderfully complex. Initially it seems sweet, but this is immediately displaced by a dry hoppy bitterness. The flavor is delicate flowers and lemon, finishing very dry and crisp. The active carbonation clears the palate fairly quickly, leaving only a slight dry alcohol burn.  The mouthfeel is very crisp and dry, much more so than most Belgian ales Ive tasted. This is quite a refreshing beer to drink!  Overall, Id pick Orval as my favorite Belgian Pale Ale. I usually prefer the darker ales, but this beer definitely stands out above the pale crowd! Those monks have learned a few things about brewing in the last 900 years!",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,MuddyFeet,2.75,"Another beer that does not live up to the hype. Poured a pale copper. The head was thick and faomy, but oddly unappealling to me. Incredibly sticky and stubborn lace. there was nothing distinctive either positive or negative about the aroma. The malts were very mild, and the other flavor rearing its head was dried apples that came across as sour ""cider."" On the positive side, the overall mouthfeel was crisp. Overall, I was not very interested in this beer and found it kind of a turnoff.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,rousee,3.83,"Murky, yeasty tanned amber. Big active head, exceptional looking white froth. Honey and floral lavender nose. Dry, herbal and less sparkling than I expected. Somewhat hot alcohol throaty feel but it smooths out fairly quickly. There is some residual slick feeling that then dies off quickly. Not too smooth and it doesn't strike me as being extremely versatile. It reminds me of Duvel, but I like Duvel a lot more than this.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,slitherySOB,4.5,"Delicious. Orval is a beer I wish I had tried before, and wish I had more of. Pours an amber/orange, with a slight haze. Large, fluffy, big bubble head that leaves sticky lace on the chalice. Smells of sweet malts, sour lambic-like smell, lemon, grass and butter. Taste has a subdued sweetness, with a blend of bitterness. Kinda generic. Basically, very well balanced, with bitterness leading. Sweetness from malts, butter, and a dry candy. Bitterness from grass, hay, lemons, the lambic sourness, and a bit of veggie. Mouthfeel is like a dry wine. An excellent beer. One I will be buying as soon as I find it again.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,WetCoaster,3.98,"**Update: After reading Garrett Oliver's lavish praise of this beer in his book ""The Brewmaster's Table,"" I decided it was time to revisit Orval. Now that my palette is a bit older and wiser, I think I'm better able to grasp what's going on here.  What threw me -- and no doubt some other novices -- is that this beer is black to most abbey ales' white; it's really the un-abbey ale in a sense. By that, I mean the flavors are unusual, unexpected and contra to the general style. Where one might expect spice, there's herb. Where there might normally be a citrus sourness, there's a rooty bitterness. Where there might be a dense smoothness there's instead crisp tightness.  Essentially, this is the beer equivalent of bitters. It's quenching, biting and challenging, with light malt base, odd herbal, even leathery, flavors and a brutal chicory bite to finish.  Granted, it's still not a favorite. But it IS intriguing. If you hated it, give it a another shot; if you don't know your Belgian ales that well, come back to this one once you do. A double-black tasting experience -- tough for novices, but an enjoyable challenge for the more experienced.  Original review: Appearance: Slightly cloudy copper with gold undertone. Absolutely massive Duvel-esque head with endless retention. Huge sheets of sticky, soapy lace. Furious, fine carbonation.  Smell: Cotton candy sweet. Banana, bubblegum, pissy yeast funk. Belgian.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Hmmm. The mouthfeel is thin and a bit crisp. The flavor seems to contradict the scent. Sour, almost bitter, bite. Lemon juice, white pepper yeast. Slighty malty on the back of the tongue with a bit of spiciness. Finishes yeasty and a bit metallic.  Drinkability: Well, it's crisp and refreshing, I guess. I don't know, for all the hype, there's not much to this one. I don't know if I'll be back.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Complex flavor; more of a hoppy, bitter character than I'm used to with Belgians, plus a touch of sour lemon. Definitely a dry, clean aftertaste.

The first thought that came to mind was a nursery I worked in during my first year of college. Smells like the old geranium house. There's some mustyness underneath.  Very dry tasting. The musty ""barnyard"" notes pop up in the middle with dried flowers taking over the finish. The flowers mingle with hops. Interesting.  Nice medium mouthfeel with moderate carbonation.

It's got a good sour-apples mixed with roses (?) smell. I don't know if tart is a smell, but this beer smells tart.  The taste: Woah! This is different, like other reviewers have said. It smells tart, but it tastes even tarter. I can detect a musty flavor so common in Belgian beers, most likely from aging and wild yeast? Its taste is also dry. There is also a taste of grain, grass and other complex components I can't identify. I'd like to try more beers like this one to compare.  The mouthfeel is very light and crisp.  This is a good beer, but keep your mind open when you try it. It isn't like other sweet Belgian beers. At all.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Bierschenker,4.68,"This is really one of my favourite beers. And one of the best Trappist beers. It pours out a beautiful amber coloured beer with a nice head. If it is poured in the one and only Orval glass of course. The smell is quite unique. A very sour and malty smell. But that is not how the beer tastes. It has a very dry taste. I recognised malt and a sort of dry bitterness, not really sour. In all its simplicity, it is a very rich beer. It has a unique aroma. An aroma I cant recognise in any other Trappist. Although it only has an alcohol percentage of 6.2%, It tastes like it is stronger. And it can be very dangerous when over consumed. The Orval beer is a very distinctive beer. Not only because of the unique taste, but also because of the unique shape of the bottle.

A huge 3 finger pillowy white froth tops my Rapscallion snifter, a cloudy dark golden beer supports it. Aroma is a yeasty supplemented with spices. A medium bodied ale with an enjoyable dryness, and a unique medicinal taste (from the phenols?). Feels moderate to high in carbonation which lends to the dry finish.

Nose is super complex. Lemon twist, orange zest, apple pipe tobacco, band-aids. Tart and musty.  So dry. Leaves a tingling, numbness on the palate. Hops and malts both recognizable, but masked by the staggering complexity of this beer. Apricot, black pepper. Dry as a bone.  Holy shit! What an amazing beer. The driest. So complex.

Like COASTERFREAK75 said, the smell of alcohol is also prevalent although it is pretty well covered up. The taste is fruity, but the alcohol taste takes hold as the drink goes down. This makes it much less smooth, and makes you take your time between sips. It also lingers for a long time after the beer is swallowed with the same alcohol-heavy taste.

The drink started very dry, this was the first Trappist I'd ever had to do this. The middle was very fruity with stong apricot and citrus flavors.

Quite exceptional pour exemplifying a pour divot in the head cap into a mountainous four inch cap, leaving a crime scene of spongy lace clues. Lest we forget a golden orange amber hued pour rife with copious carbonation bubbles rising. A statuesque pour above all else.  Airy garden like bouquet of horse blanket, leather and straw. Funky stinky feet abound. Barnyard peppery essence is quite prevalent. Angel food cake notes. The nose is half of the experience.  First swigs: Dry raw hopped sand aftertaste. Soft feel, yet bone jarring dryness. Rank cheeses aftertaste here. The raw hop character is nearly in your face. Acquired delicious palate. ORVAL never ceases to amaze. Like biting into a tumbleweed. An intermingling of bitter and sour citorus peel flavor that create a one of a kind experience.  Last swigs: Earthy straw and musty leather. Orval is a prescence of mythical proportions. With a blind eye the taste is a red light. My first Belgian/Trappist Pale infatuation. An indelible memory that will ever be an exemplary notion.

The aroma is malty but without the medicinal smell of many belgians. The taste is earthy, grainy, and very dry. It has a bitter astringent aftertaste, but no hop flavor or aroma. The flavor is phenolic as usual among Belgians. The mouthfeel is also a disappointment with very high carbonation and a medium light body.

Aroma is sweet & sour - full of apples, almost burning, but not in an alcohol way - more acidic. Very nice. The taste is very unique. Not alot of malt here, or even hop flavor really.

Honeymelon together with ripe pears, yeast, alcohol and carbonation lies lurking behind the fruit. Nice honey sweet smell with a faint touch of citric malts.  Taste hits very harsh (positively here). Extremely dry, tastes like stone. Somewhat bitter at first with a bready touch lifted by a somewhat sour and flowey feel. Somewhat fruity with a very nice dry taste throughout until aftertaste that comes on with carbonation, alcohol, yeast and a nice malty bitterness lifted by some fruits.

Aroma is slightly citruisy and peppery. Taste is dry, dry, dry. It's hard for me to pick up other flavors going around. I do pick up a touch of pepper in here as well.

Their are no off tastes.  There is a little pepperiness to the mouthfeel. It does have a medium light mouthfeel and there is some carbonation playing with tongue. The alcohol does not burn even though it is relitively high.  This is such a subtle Belgian, I would recommend it only to those just starting out trying the style.

Slight alcohol presence, but not all that strong. Dry and tart, citrus and hops are prevelant, while a slight maltiness stays in the background. Finishes dry and somewhat weak.

Aroma consists of a huge hop bouquet, reminding me of new-mown grass.  Flavor is highly bitter, full of hop flavor (reminiscent of lemon-grass). Fairly fruity & yeasty, with just a touch of that sour, earthy (fresh-turned compost) Brett character. I had never noticed the Brett until it was pointed out to me, but now it seems an obvious and essential flavor component. Finishes dry and acidic, lingering for long moments past the last sip.

37,129,sprackops,4.68,"Presentation: 11.2oz brown bottle with a best before date of 20.01.2009, a full five years after its bottled on date. Poured into a proper Orval chalice, leaving the majority of the yeast in the bottle.  Appearance: Slightly hazy amber with a wide column of bubbles feeding a dense off-white head. Beautiful.  Smell: Lemon, orange, pine, and funky barnyard yeast are just a few of the scents that come to mind. Quite a complex nose.  Taste: Very citric and drying at the start, like a dry white. Beyond this the taste expands to a particularly full balance of sweet malts and candy sugar to high alpha acid hops bitterness. Lurking in the periphery is the funky wild yeast character detected in the nose, bringing along with it an impressive gamut of earthy, rustic flavors similar to those found in complex cheeses that while not immediately appealing, are in my opinion integral to the uniquely satisfying nature of Orval. The experience is rounded out with a pleasant, mildly bitter finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with very lively carbonation. This perfectly accompanies and accentuates the flavor.  Drinkability: As I consider this the most subjective category for obvious reasons, I would normally state that I see no reason why anyone who appreciates this beer couldn't knock back a few more than other representatives of similar styles. However, considering the price that comes along with the Trappist name, it seems proper to deduct a point here.  Comments: This has been my favorite Belgian for nearly as long as I've been aware of the country's beers -- I've delayed reviewing it for so long out of fear of not doing it justice. I'd just like to add that I would love to taste more hoppy beers which utilise wild yeast strains. Oh Brettanomyces, what can't you do?",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,neonbrown82,5,"Another delicious Belgian. This is my first Belgian Pale, though. It is actually quite a pleasant change from the intense sweetness of other trappist dubbels, tripels, and quadrupels, and strong ales. Very, very delicious, and if the drinkability could go any higher than 5, I would be sure to give it that. I believe this beer is well deserving of my second ever 5 star rating on BA.  The beer erupted into a large frothy white head regardless of the careful pour. The foam refused to subdue itself, but created little dimples in the surface. The smell was the first thing that hit me as I popped open the cap. It smelled and sounded like a sparkling champagne, even tasted a bit like one. Also in the smell was something that seems to be lacking altogether in many Belgians... hops! It is by no means a hop monster, though, as the malt character clearly shows through in both the smell and taste as well. This beer is perfectly balanced between maltiness and hoppiness, in my opinion. The mouthfeel is so incredibly smooth I can't wait to take another drink. The finish is slightly dry and reveals a bit of alcohol even though is not a very huge beer at 6.9% (according to the label). As I said before, drinkability is off the charts. If you ever get a chance, buy some. I can't believe this is one of the last trappist ales I've tried. If Westy 8 and 12 can live up to their hype, I think I will have reached beer nirvana if they are better than this.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

High carbonation and creaminess in the mouthful, taste is similar to the aroma, with some spices and noticible alcohol. Some stale sourness. Very rough. Is it possible I got a bad bottle? Are my tastebuds off tonight? I haven't read any other reviews of this yet - if I'm way off from others then perhaps I've got a dud on my hands.

It is quite clear from looking at this beer that there is a ton carbonation from this brew, as the bubbles don't stop shooting up. Aromas are a mix of citrus lemony tones, and acetic almost cat piss like funk. There is also some interesting barnyard aromas. Flavors start off very spritzy to this brew with an in your face carbonation that just explodes on the pallate. There's a heavy dosage of lemony citrus flavors with hints of spice. Following there is a yeasty estery like flavor that brings about quite a dryness to this beer. There is a decent acidic punch throughout this beer which just a light dosage of maltiness and a slight sugary sweetness.

Like a subtle whiff of perfume off of the loveliest woman in the world. Flavor is a little bit of dangerous nuttiness. A prickle of vegetation. Tantalizing bite. Medium-thin and alive, smooth and dry.  There is something mysterious and unreal about this beer. When I drank it, something made me keep on thinking of spiders. It had a creepiness that tried to scare me off. Then I had nightmares after going to sleep, which is extremely rare for me. I think there is some kind of a curse on this beer. Seriously.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Pours a beautiful copper color with just a bit of chill haze.  There is a lot of spice to the nose especially clove and pepper. Just the faintest bit of medicine in the aroma.  The flavor is full of clove and pepper also with a nice little malt backbone. Finishes very dry with just a bit of bittering hops in the end.  Good carbonation and light to medium body. I would have liked a little more body to this one.,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Smell: Lemony citrus, some pine resin, juniper berries, some earthiness  Taste: Bitterness is prominent right from the start and becomes more piney and resinous at the finish. Citrus acidity is present throughout as well as some well-balanced phenolic spiciness.  Mouthfeel: Surprisingly light body and high carbonation. The texture is very light and smooth -- the beer feels very light on the palate without being watery and thin. Very nice job.  Drinkability: The light body, great complexity, and dry finish all help make this beer highly drinkable.

I always sit and enjoy the nose for ages before actually taking my first sip. (This beer is a rarity as the aroma is actually far better than the taste.)  Rich malts and a heavy bready nature that fills the palate without coating it. Elements of dark fruits, rum, some apple, even bubblegum, along with a not-so-subtle yeastiness and bitterness. More on the dry side with a slightly burnt, sour finish.  Mouthfeel is creamy but not heavy, slick but tempered with a sharp carbonation. Very drinkable for a Trappist.

37,129,RenoZymurgist,3.36,"When I was first told about a hoppy belgian brew i was very excited until i thought about how belgians like to use old hops in Lambics, and that got me to be a little worried. Still I bought one and tried it and it poured a huge effervescent head that subsided moderateky leaving some lace. The aroma was slighty fruity and had a malty dryness. The flavor was very strange as it had a strong flavor of hops but not like anything I have ever tried before. The hops were almost like juniper or some other astringent herb but stil retaining the smoothness of quality hops with no cheesiness or weird bitterness. The malt flavor was light and dry making sure that the hops were the highlight of the beer. The body was light and the carbonation led to a champagne like character as it fizzed all over your tongue during the first few drinks. An alright beer it seems pretty extreme to have one after another but if something interesting is needed this brew will certainly come through.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Some of the head got stuck in the neck of the bottle.  It smelled warm and earthy with a hint of dark fruits. I could swear I also smelled peat in there. Like a good single-malt scotch.  The mouthfeel was quite thick, and the taste was a bit bitter - some malt and hops - and again, the ""peat"" characteristic came out. Sadly, the taste was ruined by the presence of what I can only describe as soap.  Remember that terrible purple soapy-tasting gum that you used to get out of the machine at the local grocery store when you were a kid? Remember how there was always one kid who *loved* that stuff, and everybody else thought he was a freak? Well it tastes like that stuff. And it starts get a bit overwhelming as it warms.

It pours a coppery-orange with a fluffy, pillowy white head that laces and lingers and clings and clumps. Smell was very earthy and peaty, farm-like, with a hint of dark fruit. What appears to be an off-smell (horse blanket), becomes something I truly look forward with repeated sittings. Taste was a nice hoppy bitterness, dry, very earthy and peaty. It is pretty much exactly what I would picture medival monks drinking in a dank monastary. Nice creamy mouthfeel, almost a crispness to it.

It goes down very smooth and the mouthfeel is just about right-not too thick not too thin. my only complaint is the drinkibility because of the price, 8.99 for two 11.2oz bottles, after tax that about 5 bucks a beer therefore i probably won't get it again. but that doesn't take away from it being an execellent brew.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Smells very fresh, almost a melon or apple aroma. It makes me think of a candle store with a rack of scented candles on display.  Taste is tart up front, I can't put my finger on what the flavours are comparable to. There is a finish of spicyness(though not a lot), then the hops take over nicely. Citrus tastes in the middle for sure. There seems to be a lot to it, but I can't pin down the distinct flavours.  The mouthfeel is bang on for the style, a little bit of body and healthy dose of carbonation. I find myself getting through this beer rather quickly, it certainly is an easy drink.

Wow!! Creamy mouth feel...medicinal hopping that pilsners only WISH they could hold in balance with complex fruity spices and a heady nice malt wallop...all wrapped in this great funky yeast taste that defies description...the finish is mercifully slow so you can catch all the different tastes this brew has to depart....with a pleasant warming.

The beer pours a slightly hazy copper color with a thick white frothy head on top. The fruity esters combine with hints of orange peel, all spice, and sour apple to create a complex aroma. Each sip of this medium bodied beer is dry with a fizzy tingle on the palate, like champagne. The flavor is a blend of dry malt, citrus (orange and lemon), spice (allspice?) and grapes. It sort of reminds me of a white wine. It finishes with a slightly sour taste.  Orval is a full flavored somewhat complex beer.

Taste has a very fresh bread malty taste up front followed with a nice sour yeast hop taste with various flavors coming and going quickly in between, including some light citrus and various spices.

37,129,NearerMyBeerToMe,4.38,"Bottled 15.07.2003, best before 15.07.2008. Huge, sandy head full of pits and craters fills half the goblet on the first pour, ""subsiding"" into boulder-like chunks while snapping, crackling and popping loudly. Clouds of head cling to the sides of the goblet and crust into eternity. A pillar of carbonation rushes through this hemisphere of polished bronze liquid with apricot highlights. Stinks lovingly of sourdough bread, tart green apples, sweaty armpits, curdled milk. Stench of rotting canned fruit cocktail soaking in London dry gin. Nosefeel is cool and sharply acidic, as of vinegar; the aroma practically fogging up the room. Before pouring the yeast this is dry enough on the tongue, with flavors of oregano and bay spiking through a mineral-laden palate and finishing with a twist of lemon. The yeast adds flavors of rancid sweet mint, bread, human feet, and gimlets splashed over a forest floor's worth of mold and spore before fading to a subtle aftertaste of dry herbs. Pinpricks of carbonation punctuate a mouthfeel that is almost airy with lightness and distributes effortlessly over the tongue. Drinkability is dependent only on one's ability to get over one's own senses.

The mouthfeel was a little odd to me. The carbonation seemed almost too high. I had the feeling off pop rocks going off in the mouth. It wasn't bad, just different.

I quickly realised that Orval is an acquired taste, its unconventional profile really grows on you.  This beer poured a hazy orange color with the most massive, invinicible head. This bohemoth literally covers the glass in lace. There lots of frenetic carbonation as well.  The aroma is packed with brett, tropical fruit, honeydew, and also a citrusy tartness. It reminded me of tropical Starburst candies. Hops also make their presence known in the nose.  The taste is intense. There are fruit, perfume, and sour notes, as well as a medicinal bitterness. It reminds me of some kind of tropical fruit, not citrusy, but tart. Theres also a candy sugar flavor as well as some yeasty notes. Leathery brett notes are all over the place. The finish is bittering hops and some risidual tartness.  The mouthfeel is slightly thick, with lots of carbonation evident. This beer is very drinkable, it conceals its alcohol behind an array of unusual flavors. Very unique to say the least, I cant think of any other beer to even compare it too .

Just a perfect compliment. The strong flavors of the cheese cut through the medicinal bitterness and, together the two coalesce in a way that I have never seen between a food and a beverage. On my third try, I paired it with an aged sharp cheddar; while it pairs nicely, it was nothing like the combination with the St. Andre; more recently, I paired it with a blue cheese and the flavors blended startlingly well",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,jahsausage,3.82,"This beer amazes me in the way that it combines what I consider conventional and unconventional beer tastes in the same draught. It smells to me of a cross between an english ale and a wheat beer, (sorry to be so simplistiic). And in taste, perhaps the same applies but only in the most limited sense, there is SO much going on. I think I would describe it as mystifyingly good, its something you could drink quite happily but every time you stop and think about it - it just brings up more suprises.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Cwrw,4.2,"Cellared for over nearly two years.  It poured at the start with a giant cream-white head, with very large bubbles, but still very consistent. After a few minutes, it became an ultra creamy small-bubbled covering on the liquid, thin but attractive, and leaving lace that looks like snow sticking to winter glass, or styrofoam particles. Intensely unique lace. The beer is clear, orange-red, chestnut brown. The aroma at first is warmly leathery, earthy oils and must. Smelt with the head still large and churning, a strong sweet-bread note, or fresh pastries, with fruity yeast. Some chemical-like smells. Phenols make their presence known, but there are also strong ripened fruits, as if the mould was already beginning to overtake them, which gives a very good aged feel to the beer, like a vintage wine. Malty sweetness in the background, some sugar, some sryup, and a very fresh smell I am having truoble describing. Lightly detectable hop; definitely enough to add even more character, though. More fruitiness than other Trappists, such as Chimay. The taste is delectable, with definite licorice, vanilla, starchy bread, sour acidic fruits, and it leaves a numb soapy clove feel on the tongue. The main difference I note in ageing this beer for 2 years compared to newer Orvals tried is the smoothness: the aged Orval is intensely smooth, creamy and oily on the palate, making it more drinkable. A strong leather taste, with nuts of different sorts, some sweet malt, and definite hop on the finish, making for an excellent balance of all 4 elements. The lees/sediment is very bitter, fruity, and obviously yeasty/fruity. Ageing has also made the beer more potent, more alcoholic, which is no surprise. The mouthfeel as mentioned is velvety, and very full. It is also quite drinkable, being so smooth and not overly alcoholic. Ahh, the life of a Trappist.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

It's leaving a think and luxurious lace behind.  Alcohol comes through in the smell, just behind all that fruit and banana that one should expect.

Banana/pine esters on the nose, more peppery on the palate, and backed by an unusually noticeable dried herbal hop backbone. Carbonation highlights a touch of grain and fresh grassy hop leaves.  The piney aspect of this is reminiscent of the finish on some American IPAs -- of course, Orval is not nearly as bitter. This is such a clear and balanced display of hops, malt, yeast, and Belgian tradition that it becomes challenging.  The parching dryness makes it difficult, but everso satisfying to consume on its own.

Light traces of alcohol and bits of yeast in between. A very nice, fruity aroma.  Tastes mildly bitter up front with cidery apples and grapes coming out in the front. Good spiciness along with some more yeasty flavors move into a nice bitter finish with some light hoppiness.  Fairly light in the mouth with heavy carbonation, much like a sparkiling wine.

37,129,Hunter,2.5,"This Belgian monastery's brew has quite a reputation...this is the second time I've sampled their beer, first time reviewing it.  I must say before even pouring I like the small, unusually curved bottle of dark brown glass and the simple label (hey, it's part of the aesthetics, right?). As soon as the cap is off the nose is hit by a wave of malt and candi sugar. There's also an unfortunate undercurrent of formaldehyde, reminding me of hours in the lab during human dissection. As the glass warms to room temperature that preservative smell begins to dominate. Pours a cloudy gold with a thick white head, which doesn't last as long as I felt it should have. Threads of bubbles from bottom to top.  Taste...is surprisingly bland. If Perrier came in beer flavor, this would be the result. Comes off like a very dry, simple white wine. Citrus bite in the aftertaste, little else. Not even an alcohol bite, which at 6.9% is surprising. I was unimpressed the first time I tried this, and remain so. This has nothing on Chimay's beers in my opinion.  Update July 2016: Back after a decade to give this another chance. Upgrading the look by a full point - the pillowy head is lovely, very dense and enduring - almost like whipped cream. Tracing notes complete the presentation. The aroma seems less chemical this time around. The taste is still what I remembered - bland. No improvement there. Small upgrades to feel and overall, but it remains underwhelming.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,chugamugofsud,4.22,"Orval is an excellent trappist ale, it is bottle conditioned for an extensive period before sale and gets better if you let it sit around. The beer pours an orangey-amber that is cloudy with taste and there is a relatively frothy head on it at first. The beer smells of oranges (probably peel) and various herbal scents (I'm picking up rosemary) and tastes amazing. Some I've been around felt it was too carbonate; however, I think this beer makes a goal of having a symphony of taste with no featured player. Each of the various flavors (spice, fruit, herb and alcohol) work together without any of them overpowering your mouth. This beer comes well recommended (esp. to trappist ale fiends like myself).",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

There are nice spices and big whiffs of alcohol. Some sour hints are in there as well.  A bottle of '04 was very mild, with no real spiciness to it. It had a nice sweet malt backbone with some kicks of alcohol, but not a lot of complexity. I thought that if it mellowed, it would taste like nothing, but the '03 was much better. It had a nice spicy bite, and a big warming alcohol blast that was a bit too much at times, but didn't really hurt it. The carbonation is pretty big, but it smoothes out. This one didn't really do it for me as compared to others in the style.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,cerevisiaephilus,4.37,"Head is huge. Even the slightest shake and it rises up! Nose is nice big hops, but the first thing I notice is a light caramel scent. Of course mixed in with these is the funk. The wet straw kinda mouldy smell from the Brettanomyces. Really a very unique and pleasant nose.  The taste for me on this brew is all hops. I get a touch of the funk, but only in the finish really, on the back of my tongue and on my breath, kind of earthy and dank. Don't look to do any kissin' after one of these. Also just a tiny bit of caramel candy sweetness at the end there too. Definately finishes a bit astringent. A very dry beer which probably accounts for the astringency. This much hops in such a dry beer is going to make it a bit astringent. I wish it could be just a touch sweeter, but with the Brett fermentation its probably impossible unless you stopped fermentation, filtered, then bottled with an unattenuative strain or with CO2. But the tiny bit of sweetness in there is noticeable I suppose because the beer is so dry.  Mouthfeel is very effervescent and thin. Again, very dry beer. I have to say that this is quite drinkable.

Aroma is yeasty, a bit bitter, and hint of orange peel and spice. Body is medium and almost refreshing while stil chilled a bit. Flavor is at first dominated by malt and funky bread flavors, with only a hint of spice at first as well as some lemon tartness.

Amber-orange and slightly hazy color with a towering foamy white head sticking way outside the goblet and forming a peak. Insane level of carbonation keeps the head alive for a long time. The aroma is hoppy with lots of musty smells underneath. Taste is hoppy, acidic, and peppery. I am drinking this a year after it was bottled. At this point in time the beer is not very sweet or fruity. Quite refreshing with a light mouthfeel, but with a satisfying punch. I will have to get some fresh and see how it tastes at the time of bottling.

Body pours a cloudy orange. The last two inches are clearer than the rest. The head is absoutely HUGE, the glass barely contained it, who knows how the bottle did?  A heavy fruit smell to this brew. I haven't had wine much but it smells much like I would think a fine wine would. I could almost swear there are flowers in here too. The smell hints at more than the 6.9 ABV that's in here.  I'm giving this a few more minutes to warm a bit, will probably need it...the taste is like a dry wine but a very good one, as I am not usually a fan of dry wines.  The mouthfeel is not as active as I expected when I saw that huge head. As described in the taste, it does go down pretty dry but is smooth and warming as well. Would go with a cool winter night.  That said, while this one is plenty drinkable, it isn't in the way that you could have several of these. Would be good with dinner but then you'd want something darker.

Yes, I would rather have a porter or an imperial stout, but these damned belgains are eating away at me. Don't get me wrong, I still think Chimay and Ommegang are gross, but I can't let them ruin it for the rest of them.  Orval Trappist Ale is a spectacular testament to Belgain trappist brewing. Brewed to the highest standards, it holds true to its rock solid reputation as one of the finest ales in the world.  Poured from a blue tear-drop bottle, it radiated with a beautiful orange amber colour with a hazy, unfiltered clarity. The head, thick and mountainous, released a wonderful aroma of fruits and grains. Enough to bring one back to moms kitchen.  After all the ""work"" examining the nectar, I had to taste it.  Apple cider, bananas, coreander, a touch of lemon. Fruity and tart with only the most mild bit of bitterness. A fantastic complexity with the most incredible simplicity rolled into one. Smooth and pleasing to the palate.  This is a wonderful beer in so many ways that one cannot put it all into words. This is the beer to convert any ""wine snob"" to the ways of the heathen.

The head is thick and foamy, sort of looks like that foam you see at the ocean when a big storm is coming, or at the edge of a fast moving stream. Anyways, to continue on, the aroma is somewhat effervescent and fruity, raspberry, perhaps? Lacing over the honey hued brew is incredible as the head begins to join it's liquid brethren. Slightly sour flavor where the fruits come into play, and then rounds out a bit with the malt and slight alochol warming.

Too much carbonation keeps the light flavor from reaching the tongue. I let it sit for 15 minutes before I opened and I think it needs even more time to warm.

Some citrus and spice came through as did a small small bit of hops but i sense no malt backbone. I just wish it had a little more balance. Mouthfeel is decent, nice and smooth.

It smells complex and it made me antsy to sample this one. The taste is slightly less exciting than the aroma, but still one solid brew! It starts with the carb bite that slides into a light spicey fruit and yeast that tapers into a dry seltzer like taste.

Head stays around forever, leaving tatted lace all over the chalice. Intricate aromas, black pepper, hops, lemon zest, some barnyard and sweaty farmyard, but oh so beautiful. The taste is as equally complex. Never sweet, the whole experience is just a dry assault on the palate. Some grapefruit or other sweet/sour citrus, some barnyardy saisonishness, another part yeasty. Mouthfeel's spritzy and well-carbonated for a beer of such ABV. Wholly enjoyable (I guess the reason I'd fork over $90 for a case of it a year ago).

The smell is an earthy sweetness, like a field of grass in the rain scattered with freshly ripped grapefruit and orange rinds. In the middle of the nose some peppery and banana notes flood through.  Taste opens with a quick undercut of bitterness, followed by an overhead dirty hay mustiness -- I pick up on an almost pepperoni-like taste here, greasy and spicy -- aftertaste is back to the bitterness. Not much of a malt presence here. Also in the aftertaste, which has a very dry finish, is an alcohol rub in the nose and gut -- but isn't noticeable directly in the taste.

Most belgian beers are somewhat shadowed by their carbonation levels, but not here. Sweet, tart hops followed by sweet darkmalts and alcohol.

The aroma is of Hops with a bit of candy and well that typical barn scent. This one has more horseblanket, barn scent than most, perhaps because it is so young. The taste is almost pale aleish. Very hoppy at first, then it gives way to a bit of candied fruit. Not very complex at this age. I will have to get a couple to see how they turn out. The carbonation is high, but the mouthfeel is still nice. I think the carbonation helps cleans the tongue and this would be good with some fatty foods esp with the high hops at this age.

Large amount of carbonation at the bottom of the glass.  Smell: Interesting aroma, dominated by sweet herbal aromas, a hint of hops, lemon and even some grass. This beer smells almost like an American IPA at first, with less dominant citrus notes. There's also a sweet citrus aroma, maybe oranges.  Taste: The nose is dominated by strong lemon citrus and bitter hops, which quickly fade to a more bread-like flavor. This beer has the initial ""IPA bite,"" but the aftertaste is much more complex, with sweetness coming from dry apples. Very dry, bitter finish with more lemon and some grain. As the beer warms, the aftertaste includes more lingering sweetness, a hint of banana, and more raw grain that other reviewers have described as ""barnyard."" But in a good way. No evident alcohol flavors in the finish.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is noticeably thinner than the other Trappist Ales I've tried, and the carbonation is a little too high.  Drinkability: For a Belgian beer, a fairly low alcohol content combined with a dry, clean taste makes this one very drinkable.  Orval Trappist Ale is different from the other Trappist beers I've tried, with a lower alcohol content and a flavor that reminds me of an American pale ale or IPA. Nevertheless, it's damn tasty, very affordable (at least in Paris), and the only Trappist I've had so far that could be a session beer. Not as good as St. Bernadus or Rochefort, but if you haven't already tried it, one to consider.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,BuckeyeNation,2.55,"Bottled on 8-01-03. Michael Jackson, in the latest edition of his 'Great Beers of Belgium', says that the current brewer at Orval likes this beer best at 6 months. Who am I to say different? My bottle is just shy of 7 months, so I should be on pretty solid ground here.  This might be heresy to some, but Orval Trappist Ale looks just like an American IPA. It's a rich, orange-accented amber that is lightly hazy and has a wealth of vigorous carbonation jumping off the bottom of the glass. The head is off-white, large, fairly stiff and falls to a thick, lumpy film, leaving disappointingly little lace.  The aroma is different from anything that I've ever experienced (or even imagined). I do pick up quite a bit of the 'horse barn' smell, but it isn't unpleasant at all. There are also mildly spicy, slightly lemony, grassy notes to go along with it and keep it interesting.  Orval's flavor is not to my liking. The somewhat pleasant horse barniness of the aroma is in full force on the palate and doesn't work nearly as well. There's a huge jolt of sour, earthy unpleasantness that fades quickly and leaves the mouth dry. The mouthfeel, as with many Belgian ales, is too riotously carbonated.  I'm pretty certain that, no matter the age (from fresh to the 5 years of the 'best by' date) Orval Trappist Ale is not for me. If it's an acquired taste, then it's one that I will never acquire... because I won't be drinking any more of it.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,the42ndtourist,4.75,"Orval seems a bit of an intangible to me...  Appearance is a reddish-golden sort of colour. (not crystal-clear, of course). the head billows and stays around until the end.  This is the thing. The first time I had it I was struck by the sourness - it's not exceptionally sour, but there certainly is an element of that. So that jumped out at me and I was fascinated, I loved the toned-down sour ale aspect. Since then, I get a different idea every time (and it's always good). Sometimes it seems like a amber abbey ale with a very distinguished flavour, aromatic and just a little spicy. Most recently (last night) I was hit by the hoppiness - this is probably due to the excessive amount of cask bitters I've had recently. This is truly bitter for an Old World beer. Not too much (never is Orval too much), and there's still a great little sour note to it.  It's because of this ephemeral quality that I think Orval is one of the few beers that I could actually drink day in day out and never get tired of. At least, I hope that's so.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,steelreign,4.48,"Fantastic billowing rocky white head that never dies. Huge. Smell is of leather, spices, flowery esters, hops and barnyard funk. So complex, its hard to even describe. Taste is magnificent, bready, malty with notes of banana and spice. Big mouthfeel with nice carbonation. Overall, one of the better Belgians I have had. This one was bought while in Belgium, too, so it made it seem a little more authentic. :)",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Globetrotter,4.4,"Well, we meet at last... Found this in a grocery store in a part of Moscow I don't usually frequent. Pounced on the opportunity, of course. Brown bowling pin like 33cl bottle with a small green and white neck label featuring a fish jumping behind the name, and ""Trappist Ale"" in five language. Ingredients comply with the purity law. Best before 9/24/04, I opened it on 2/15/04, in honor of my father's birthday.  The Russian import label calls this simply: ""pale beer"". My goodness, what an understatement! Pours a lovely cloudy deep gold with hints of amber under a fluffy white head that starts thick, but settles to substantial film. There are only some spots of lace on my glass, but I'm tempted to blame the glass. The nose is magnificent: Cotton candy and flowers, and lots more sensations I can't quite describe. Sorting all this complexity out is one major nasal challenge! The mouth is heavily carbonated and surprisingly light. The taste? Lord have mercy! Candy, sugar, spices, lemon peel, and a thousand other things to confront the tongue, jowels, palate and every other part of the mouth. Then, the hops emerge. Rare for a Belgian, this beer is very well hopped. Good crisp, flowery hops that dominate the finish and leave a very tart bitterness in the aftertaste. Oh, yeah, I'll have another.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,counselor,4.38,"A beauty. Pours hazy pale color with a thick, tall white head. Lots of bubbles continue to rise as the beer settles. Smells of lemony hops, musty yeast and fresh meadow. Tastes great, floral hop notes, crisp tangy malt profile, mild & earthy yeast profile. I could drink this beer all night. The mouthfeel was well balanced, what an easy drinking beer that really had tons of taste. May be my new favorite belgian?",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Ieatlambfries,4.16,"The appearance of this strong pale ale was excellent. Hazy dark gold with an immense fluffy head. The smell was not really to my liking however, not horrible, just not my style. It hit me with musty yeast at first followed by something reminiscent of horse manure. I see one of the bro's used the term horse blanket in their review (as part of taste) and that's a pretty good description also. The taste however was leaps and bounds above the smell. Still very musty, but with a citrus hop bitterness. Defiantly yeasty, with some herby graininess. Mouthfeel was excellent as well, medium bodied and crisp. I found it to be very carbonated. Drinkability was good although, I really could not get over the darn horse manure smell, enough to say it was better than ""good,"" but to some the smell may be to their liking. Just a matter of preference. All and all though an excellent beer, and one of the legendary 6 true Trappist ales. Give it a go if you like Belgian beer and haven't already. You won't be sorry. Oops, almost forgot, my bottle said 6.9% abv., not 6.2%. Go figure.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,WesWes,3.6,"The beer pours a cloudy gold color wit a thick overflowing white head. The aroma is good. It boasts of pale malts and lemon zest. The taste is decent. It is light and citrousy. It has a musty aftertaste, but goes down smooth. The mouthfeel is fair. It is a medium bodied beer with too much carbonation. It drinks well. I thought the taste was good. It just was a little too foamy. All in all, this was pretty decent.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,twilight,4.75,"I'm trying to pin down the aroma. It's subtle unless I stick my nose into the goblet- Like old leather, or, rather, like the white part of lemon rind. Yeah, that's it...  Beautiful 12 oz. bottle, Chimay goblet because I have not been able to find an Orval goblet in NYC during the last month. Alas.  The pour makes me nervous, the head is fluffing up above the rim of the goblet and goes up and up. Beautiful, beautiful orange color with a huge head that remains fairly thick until the end of the glass. It's still there, but it's just thinner by the end. Webbed lacing all over the glass. Perfect.  The taste is of smoothness, giving way to sourness and a hint of lemon that gives way to a bite with hoppy undertones. Good, but a little more maltiness would have been in order. The beer is light with just the right amount of carbonation and a hint of the alcoholic content in the aftertaste. In truth, I would love to drink this all night were it not for the price.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Reneejane,3.47,"It came out of the bottle a dark amber color with quite an impressive foamy off-white head that laced down the side of the glass but diminished greatly pretty quickly. The aroma was of a noticeable banana ester with a general floral hop smell to complement it. It tastes spicey, banana-y, and somewhat bitter. It isn't an overwhelming flavor, fairly mild. I really thought it was excessively carbonated, it really fills your mouth (and more) up with gas pretty quickly. ""burp!"" Overall not bad, not great, but a little overcarbonated.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Dukeofearl,4.55,"33 cl bottle with ""Best By"" date of 17/07/2007. This must be fairly freshly brewed. Pours a beautiful creamy (small bubbles) huge head (into a Leffe Goblet glass, similar to Orval's Goblet) that fills the remainder of the goblet. Slowly collapses in 10 minutes to about a half inch, clings to the glass.  Color is a slightly cloudy orange/dark golden color with a fair amount of carbonation release after some time. Flavors very complex, and this is where my tasting abilities decline. Smooth and crisp, a little medicine flavor and a strong but not overpowering hoppiness. It is very dry and tart. The flavor also stays a long time.  I drank this beer slowly (savoring every taste), which gave it time to warm quite a bit. The beer became much more hoppy as it warmed, and I found the combination of flavors much more satisfying at the bottom of the glass than at the beginning- temperature related?  This is my first review, I chose to wait and review one of my favorite beers to start.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,granger10,4,"This beer poured a very bright (almost flourescent) orange color with a lively white head. Lots of lacing around the glass. The aroma was strongly yeasty and slightly fruity. The flavor brought about a bouquet of fruits, mostly tarty and citric. Yeast, however, dominated my palate and was overwhelming at times. It was also slightly bready at times. The finish was extremely dry. This was a well made, well carbonated beer but it was nothing spectacular.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,IrishRedRock,4.15,"Bottled July 15 '03. Bottle says 6.9% ABV. Very simple bottle, but I think that's classy. Orangey colored body with huge bubbles and and enormous, rocky thick chunky white head. Very fruity aroma, reminiscent of clementines and tangerines. Dry yeasty spices in the nose as well.  To me, the flavor of this brew is unique in comparison to the other Trappist beers. Much, much dryer on the palate, similar to champagne or a dry white wine. Has a sweeter cherry fruit flavor that cuts the tartness in the finish. Very dry. The alcohol is pretty undetectable in the nose and taste, but sneaks up just a little and warms you nicely. Very dry, citrusy, and highly drinkable. Exceeded my expectations.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Admiraldinty,4.03,"Pours a golden orange with an enormous white, foamy head. Quite a site to see. I made the mistake of using a tulip glass - I think I needed something a bit bigger. Aroma is slightly fruity, and a little sweet. Very fizzy and crisp mouthfeel - kind of burns you on the way down. Light fruity citrusy taste, a little on the sour side, and also a good deal of spice. Ends fairly dry. I was expecting something with a bit more flavor. Overall a nice brew, but not my favorite Trappist.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Enormous head of ""monks riding a cloud"" lasts the duration, though leaving a few of the brethren to occupy the cumulus cloud lacing. Quite a stunning appearance. Nose is coriander, cloves, orangepeel, allspice, lilac, lavender, kiwis, pineapple, ruby red grapefruit, mangos....I could keep going. Mouthfeel is fizzy, dry, champagne like but crisp.  Taste: A blooming wildflower meadow by a pristine, gurgling, mountain brook, as you are nibbling on honeydew melon and ruby red grapefruit, topped with sparkling Midori. Finishes a ""want more"" crisp and dry. I didn't expect to rate this one very high. Its appearance resembles a Duvel, which I like less than when I reviewed it. The Orval is a remarkable enlightenment for me, suggesting I give the Duvel another look, but no...I think it's just the superiority of this complex Strong Pale Belgian Ale.

While pouring the liquid, you come to understand what's with everyone talking about all the unique flowers in the aroma from this legendary trappist beer. Lilac is all over the place, your nose doesn't even have to be close to the nice graal-like glass. The numerous and regular bubbles escape relatively fast leaving just a perfect relatively small white head. The taste is very spicy with coriander, citrus and just so many I can't name.

Oranges, tangerines and a bit of grapefruit sweetened with some clover honey. Hints of heather and lavender. Very perfumey. I've seen beers described as barnyard before but never picked up on that until I tasted this. It's certainly that, with almost a leathery tinge. Gives way to the sour fruits and a mild hop bitterness. Finishes crisp, dry and long. Didn't quite deliver on the promise of the aroma but interesting nonetheless. Seemed a little thin and overcarbonated. Decent drinkability. Haven't made up my mind on whether I like that ""barnyard"" character yet.

Must sip and enjoy because of the taste and the carbination. One for every of your close friends at a special dinner.  I had the 2nd in a special package two months later and it stank. The taste was gone. I stored it in the basement. Aren't these Belgians robust? I think the temperature range was OK.  Two years later, new stock of Orval.

Bit of the old barnyard. Some orange, and forest floor. Touch of pine as well. Just wonderful to smell.  Plenty of malt on the palate, which serves as a launching pad for a vast array of spice and herb flavors. I always get sage and clove as the predominant elements, but there's a good dose of thyme in this one as well. Strong chalkiness particularly in the finish, which is very long.  Mouthfeel is soft and lovely, and really lets the complexity shine through. Very drinkable and a real treat on its own or with dinner. I love Orval for its uniqueness.

37,129,wyllder,2.53,"Ok,  I had this one recommended to me by a fellow hop-head. My primary love in beer-life is hops. Brews like Hopdevil & Stone IPA top my list of favorites. That said, I'll get into my review of Orval Trappist.  Beer pours a mid-range amber with a big, fizzy, carbonated head. Really, I think the color rating is subjective, as I prefer a deep & clear amber to the lighter and slightly opaque amber of the Orval.  Taste.. Hmm. The first word that came to mind was medicinal. I checked this against two of my friends and the response was the same: cough syrup. Maybe this was my first experience with Bavarian & Yugoslavian hops but I found the flavor altogether unappealing. There's a good bit of malt balance that comes in to hold the hops back, and several floral overtones. None of this, however, could distract my palate from a foreign hop bitterness I was unable to enjoy.  Overall, I would not recommend this to someone who loves American hopped beers.  Update: Sampled this again off a friend during a session at the Moan and Dove. The cough medicine taste noted before is still there. This time, though, I can more appropriately call it an Orajel flavor. Like Orajel, it actually creates an unpleasant numbing sensation on the palate. Like before, I checked my impression with the friend who had ordered it and he concurred: Orajel. Is there benzocaine in this stuff?  Final update: Tried this one last time, after having given my palate a chance to adapt to Belgians such as Achel, Quintine, Westvleteren, Rochefort, Bink, etc... Also followed the suggestion of other BA's and made this beer my first selection of the evening. Net result, I no longer think is completely vile. However, the odd and rather unpleasant medicinal/orajel flavors noted previously remain, though being much more subdued than I recall. While it was more palatable on my third try, I still cannot recommend this beer. I upgraded my taste rating to 2.5.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,RockyTopHeel,4.3,"After pouring my Orval, I found a foamy, pitted head with fairly large bubbles sitting atop a fragrant, glowing orange-red brew. I'm pretty excited about this beer, as I didn't get a chance to try it while I was in Belgium last summer, and was thrilled to find it at Ashe's last month in Knoxville.  Smells nice and Belgian, with an indescribable roundness and distinct, fruit-sour appeal. Upon further review, I think what I'm trying to get at in the roundness is the ""hay"" character that others have described.  Sourness (somewhat reminiscent of the gueuze I had a week or two ago, though in taste only) is the first taste to dance across my tongue, followed by a mellow wheat tone and a crisp, dry finish. This beer fills the mouth nicely, and is very, very drinkable, so long as you enjoy the sour notes (and I do).  I didn't really know what to expect with Orval beyond very, very general thoughts (like TheJoj's ""Orval is my favorite Belgian beer""), but it's definitely made a good impression as my first Trappist, despite the fact that I think I expected something closer to a Belgian Pale Ale. Either way, it looks like I'll be taking regular pilgrimages to Ashe's on my trips home from college for this one.

The Orval is a very nice hazy golden brown with a huge white head that is long lasting, and the lacing is also long lasting.  The aroma is one of herbal essences, very field-like so that it is a grainy smell almost new-mown hay, really unusual. But the tast is what is unique and fantastic. It is a little different than any other Belgian and any other Trappist. It definitely has the herbal tastes, but even more overwhelming is the hoppy flavor of a variety of hops that I haven't experienced before. Very strong, very good, but the alcohol content is only mild.  It has a very clean, refreshing mouthfeel with a lot of body and no watery tinges. It is a wonderfully drinkable beer that I might have given a 5 to for taste and drinkability except that I think there is still a beer out there that will be better.

We opened one, poured into non-orval approved glassware. The slight off-white head was huge, massive, if not in the way for it settled very slowly. What comes to pass after the head is very nice, thick rings of sticky lace. An orange/amber cloudy haze of liquid appears. The aroma is of citrus or straight lemon. The taste is smooth with a tart, hop bite. The body is mid to thin. The mouth is left dry, thirsty. Drinkable, yes. Knowing the history, the abbey, the monks. Very cool!!

Wet horse/wet wool smell buried in there.  Hits the mouth somewhat sweetly, but finishes up dryly. Winelike in character. Interesting, but a somewhat watery mouthfeel.

Slightly cloudy, with fast moving carbonation moving through the golden liquid. What a head! Just slightly off white - and incredibly huge. It slowly settles, very slowly, leaving lace all over the glass. Some puffy clouds are left floating on top.  An intense aroma - hops, herbs, a hint of something sour, & wet wool. Incredibly complex.  It passes the lips and leads off with a playful touch of sour wet leather. It continues with fresh herbs, spring flowers, and fresh cut grass. All of this is brought home with some acidity and then goes very dry. Very dry.  Medium bodied, brisk carbonation, very smooth.  Some of the sour / acidic flavours begin to take a toll on the tongue long before its finished. But overall, I'm very impressed.  When I poured the yeast, the smell was of manure.

37,129,Gueuzedude,4.7,"Orval is always wonderfully complex and hoppy, and it did not disappoint this time. This is a very unique beer brewed by some of those zany Belgian Trappist monks, and is loosely in the pale ale style; being pale, an ale and quite hoppy, including dry hopping. At this point it leaves the standard pale ale road, among possible others, it is made using Brettanomyces yeast which add a complexity of flavor which I typically say adds a musty note. At first thought this does not appear to be all that tasty (musty, horse blanket; I have some old leather shoes like that) but I feel that if done right over the correct amount of time it adds wonderful notes of complexity. This beer does it correctly, and I always love being able to sample this wonderful beer.  The beer pours a hazy copper-orange color, and is topped by a tan creamy head. As I pour this beer the Brett character is immediately noticeable; aromas of musty cellars, and leather. A sweet fruity aroma is here as well but the musty brett character dominates. The beer is well carbonated. It is lightly sweet up front, but only just as this is a dry beer. Has a certain sharp dryness in the finish that is coupled with a funky-woody-musty character. There is some residual hop character still here, though it is hard to separate it out.  This remains a challenging/ characterful brew on this side of the Atlantic. When fresh it is quite a bit different; still good but in a fresh hoppy sort of way. I love that the Belgians still embrace ornery ""spoilage"" organisms in their brews, it makes for a much more colorful world.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Popsinc,3.49,"Appearance: an cloudy amber/brown pour with an enormous and foamy head accompanied with a very lively body. the glass makes for excellent presentation. it LOOKS like a great beer.  Smell: a dull woody nose, different from what i remember sampling in Canada. earthy notes are very prominent although the nose seems subtle and held back.  Taste: rich and creamy, again, more so then i remember. more woodiness is present in the body along with slight herbal characteristics.  Mouthfeel: very rich and very lively. lots of activity in this beer.  Drinkability: to me this is the most different from all the other trappists. obviously much mess sweet. decent drinkability alothough it is not nearly my favorite trappist. i'm suprised it ranks so highly. i wonder if this is b/c it is labelled a ""trappist""?",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Andreji,3.5,"It is certainly a pale ale, this one, but a nice decent trappist product.  Pours an orange kinda tainted tone which reminds me of the sorta pale ale that sierra nevada has. And the product itself is very similar: a tough, bitter sweetness both in nose and taste that while being good is not all that great for my taste (les goûts et les couleurs ne se discutent pas!), But still is a nice refreshing malty-hoppy blend that works always. The trappistes at orval have passed the test.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Strong earthy floral nose... banana, lemon, hay, and spice are also present. Taste begins light and tart then turns to a heavy musty earthy flavor with complex hints of spice, lemon, cider, and tangy berry. Curiously strong hop bite. Finishes extremely dry. Mouthfeel is medium and very warming with strong carbonation.  An absolutely stunning ale. Very complex and wonderful.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Very complex. Always changing. Every one tastes a little different. Very fun for vertical tasting sessions. Great with most foods, especially anything needing a nice, dry and slightly bitter counterpoint.  This bottle was quite young, so the flavors were a lot more raw. A bit more bitter and hoppy than some of the older bottles I've tried. An interesting drink even if you get an old, beat-up, mishandled bottle. The balance between malt sweetness and the bitterness fluctuates a lot over time. As does the flavors coming from the bacterial profile. Swirling up all the sediment and dumping in the glass towards the end is always a tasty bonus!",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,diablo14,4.58,"I've never drank a beer that divides opinion more than this one. While i personally think its up in the top 20, others don't rate it at all.  I don't think there can be any question there are few more complex beers being brewed today. I think this is what makes it so sensational. Everything about Orval to me represents the ultimate in craftsmanship, where as some of my fellow beer connoisseurs feel there's too much going on and its all a bit overwhelming. As far as I'm concerned tho, i love being overwhelmed by this beer. It's brewed in a abbey. and drinking it is a religious experience!  The head has to been seen to be believed! It's like meringue and it just never quits. This is due to the chipped candy sugar they put in the kettle. The rich, cloudy golden orange color matches the head perfectly, and the smell and taste are almost indescribable. You can draw something new from this brew every time you drink it. One day it can be fruity, apple and orange come to mind, whereas others it can be very sugary sweet. I've had this beer taste peppery, and at various times there have been hints of clove, anise, cinnamon even nutmeg, all the while never forgetting the essential backbone of malt and noble hops. These give this beer that classic bready taste, somewhat reminiscent of brioche, and a magnificent finish bordering on bone dry (with a beer of this texture, its pretty hard to finish THAT dry). Depending on the time and mood, a different facet jumps out at you. It's just so perfectly constructed and balanced!  i do find when its very young it can on occasion be a bit astringent. But if you've got the patience to lay it down for a bit (a year or even two), or pick one up from your bottleo that's been around for a while, you will be well rewarded. Orval is proof that a beer can get better with age. It's always syrupy in the mouth, but as it gets older, it really rounds out and comes right into its own.  After a session of several top quality beers, it's awesome to finish the night with one of these just to put it all in perspective. It's almost enuff to make me want to join a monastery.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,HardTarget,3.9,"Orval Trappist Ale: Brown odd shaped bottle, like an upside down champagne flute. Best by date (17 07 2007) Reviewed 10/10/03 Aroma: Bananas with spicy notes, such as clove, and maybe some nutmeg Appearance: Deep hazy golden with a huge fluffy white head. Moderate pour produced about 5 fingers of head, which condensed more than collapsed into a small thickly packed head that held it&#8217;s form over a finger over the rim of the glass on the second pour. Head looks like whipped cream. Did I mention it had a head? Head remained and laced with heavy tidemarks. Flavor: Tastes like a caramelized banana. This has a deeper flavor than the aroma, with a very fine balance that I have to give the edge to malt, just for some sweetness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel: Medium- light, with some heavy carbonation. Overall Impression: A mild, but very complex flavor. A nice blending of spice, malt and yeast that gives an impressive, but again, milder taste. While this is obviously a well-made beer, it just didn&#8217;t strike a chord with me, which hurt it&#8217;s drinkability score in my book.

Pours a hazy golden brown with a big foamy head. Smells bitter and yeasty. Floral. Hints of light malt with spice.  Tough to describe the taste as I have had nothing like it. Alternately sweet and bitter up front fading to a sour apple flavor. Yeasty but more than that it tastes bready like sourdough. Strong alcohol finish at times, warming in the throat. Full bodied but with light aftertastes.  This brew fits no specific style. It is truly a one of a kind experience.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,jlervine,3.57,"The beer poured a dark golden color, somewhat hazy, with a thick medium-bubbled head. The smell was spicy, fruity, and very bready/yeasty. A bit of banana in there, too. The taste was spicy - too spicy, really, like someone accidentally dropped a large container of white pepper in the batch. A bit of malt was hiding back there, and the finish was just as strong spiced with a tinge of clove-numbness. The overabundance of white pepper was just too strong to truly enjoy this one, but it paired with some roquefort cheese very well.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,RoyalT,2.83,"Appearance  Very deep, cloudy, orange body with a tinge of brown underneath a beautiful, volcanic head that went down slowly and laced the glass. Yep, its a BSPA.  Smell  Classic, spicy, BSPA aroma. This one has a nice light malt base filled with clove, coriander, pepper, paprika, and maybe even a little cinnamon. The fruits seem more on the sour side, though, which would be off-style.  Taste  This has a deep, rich flavor, but again its heavy on the lemons. Anyway, that said, this is actually dry from the hop balance. The spices are heavy on the tongue as well.  Mouthfeel  Full carbonation and a sour profile makes this medium-bodied BSPA a real sipper.  Drinkability  I was disappointed by this offering. I felt it was off style and lacked the fruity character that Ive come to enjoy from strong Belgian ales.  Comments  Sorry, not my idea of the style. Pop a Pranqster or La Fin Du Monde to see what I prefer. Or, better yet, read TheLongBeachBums review of the Avec Les Bons Voeux.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

The only thing I can take away from on the appearance is that I would have liked to see a bit more yeast. The smell is powerfully sweet and fruity with a hint of cloves.  The taste is definitely more mellow than the smell and I had a hard time picking out any of the sweetness or fruit in the smell. There is a definite hoppy bitter aftertaste. The carbonation was way overdone and almost overpowered an otherwise good beer.

37,129,Loki,3.16,"Sampled from 33cl bottle with a Best Before date of 04 2007. Should I have let this age more?  I will try this again, but I was very disappointed. Maybe my expectations were too high. Maybe it was a bad bottle. Maybe I don't like the style, but I doubt the last one.  Poured a hazy amber color with a big white, frothy head that faded some what quickly to a thin, bumby covering. A quick swirl at anytime during the sampling brought back a 1/4 foam head that had a eye like the center of a hurricane.  The aromas were very fruity. Smells of pear, apricot, peach, and bananas with hints of malt and some hops hidden way in the back and I could only catch a glimpse of occationally. Like that hot girl in a crowded, smokey bar that you can only see when the crowd moves just right and your not really sure through the cloudy haze if it was her.  The taste help more fruit than the nose. Flavors of pear, apricot, bananas, and leather. Yes leather and more banana than I expected or was prepared for. Very unbalanced. The body was medium, but the finish was very sticky. I couldn't get it off the sides of my mouth, teeth, and tongue.  My wife thought it was aweful. Said, ""This tastes like fruit and old shoe leather. If this was a wine I would say it was corked.""  It didn't think it was that bad, but I was very disappointed.

Anyway, the head on this fellow was a virtual monster!! massive and foamy the head stays and stays! The beer pours a good copper blonde with some orange highlites. Aromas are ripe and fruit driven with flavors of grapefruit, citrus peel and fruitcake. The beer is medium in body with soft carbonation and a creamy feel. The taste is at once bitter citrus hopiness-veryredolent of citrus zest or oil. The whole emphasis in flavor seems to center on bright twangy citrus, and I, betting this is a fantastic food wine. I'll try it with some whitefish and potato and report back. I think I score the drinkability a bit low as this seems most certainly made for food vs simply sipping. I will try again and re review as needed.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

This beer makes you feel like your really experiencing something worth lending your attention towards.  A good glob of head kept me company throughout the whole bevi. And so did a sweet aroma representing a candy flavour wich provided a mouthfeel from the heavens.  This is a good one. One of my favorites. I recently made a trappiste ale and the best one of mine that I tasted came out of the Orval bottle I used during bottling. Maybe its a monk-like sign.

37,129,nomad,4.75,"Note to all: this beer can be quite inconsistent. I've had okay bottles, not so great bottles, and truly mind-boggling bottles. So, give it a second try if you didn't like it. My guess is that the very traditional and wholesome ingredients and technique, coupled with those ornery Belgian yeasts and a long ride to the U.S. creates the possibly infrequent quality.  Pours a perfectly clear copper color, with loads and loads of carbonation that never stops bubbling fast the whole session. The soft but very bubbly head stays put, truly never recedes. Also has nice thick and slow moving lace, a good sign. Smells of hops, leather, wild yeast like a gueuze. In turns the scents also: toned down clover, pepper, juniper, grapefruit rind, and a faint light-roasted walnut. In sum, a fresh and active nose of smells. Taste is a slew of flavors coming together all at once: fruity, roasty, sour, hoppy, with emerging slight lemon flavors that were inflected with bits of all of the above. Some interesting malt hiding behind all these wild and savory flavors. The finish is ""just enough"" as this beer comes on softly and expertly, refreshing and reinvigorating, with a just firm body and a smooth almost oily mouthfeel. With aging the mouthfeel thins out.  Quite a ride, with none others even remotely like it.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

The big carbonation also carries a great aroma full of bannanas with hints of spices and other fruit. The lacing is outstanding. As great as the beer looked and smelled, the taste was a bit disapointing. I thought it was a bit too bitter, acidic and had an unpleasant coppery taste.

The aroma is mostly of fruit and sour at that. This follows through in the flavor which comes across as a sour fruit taste. No doubt this is a very complex with great complexity, if one is willing to get past the opening nose-wrinking smell and taste. There is clearly a great malt base and dandy yeast and hops at work here. Enjoyable? Depends on your point of view.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,SeanChouffe,3.87,I had pretty high expectations for this beer -- being a Trappist and all. The highlight of the Orval was its wonderful aroma (fruity with a hint of clove). It is a little cloudy with an amber color and a nice full head that lasted all the way through. Pleasant texture that was lively and with good character. Everything prior to the taste was great -- full and complex but finished with a medicinal flavor. I found it a little disappointing.,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

37,129,SamuraiJack,4.55,"This is a near unique beer in my experience - and a fabulous treat for someone who appreciates Belgian ales.  First pour shows a light amber beer with strong gold and orange highlights. The hazing is quite light and there is only a small amount of yeast sediment. The head is, well, incredible. And magnificent. A stunning, fluffy mass of everlasting rocky white dense foam.  The aromas are equally amazing. There is that intense burst of funky yeast that sets this beer apart from the other Trappists. In some ways the horse blanket aroma here reminds be of the aromas from the Fantome Saison. Strong floral aromas with a nice grapefruit/lemon spice touch. Smelling this beer is perhaps better even than drinking it.  In taste it is immensely smooth with a crisp bite in the middle and a citric/grapefruit finish. The body is rather light for a Trappist and there is a huge amount of effervesence. Noticable hop flavours and some phenol notes in the middle. As the grapefruit fades the dryness takes over. Now this is a dry finishing beer!!  The only downside to this beer is that it is so complex that I honestly don't think I could drink more than a couple without my palette being overwhelmed.

The front is peppery, with some grapes giving it a dry wine-like flavor. Interesting. The middle goes slightly sour, with hints of apples. The tang is almost a little tonic-watery.

It's a good beer, but it was almost as if I was witnessing a catfight between the yeast and the hops. They were both there, but they didn't achieve any sort of harmony. I've had it twice and I've made up my mind: it simply isn't a $3/bottle beer.

I poured this beer in it's dedicated Orval glass and drank it slowly which lasted about 20-30 minutes. The head stayed at a peak the entire duration and even after the last sip, it was still hanging on to the side of the chalice for it's dear life. The flavor was so unique and complex that it will most likely require several additional samplings to accurately define what I'm sensing. Burnt sugar, stale fruit, earthy malty taste. I don't know, perhaps my palate doesn't possess the sophistication for this one. What I do know is that It was a most enjoyable if not a religious experience and I look forward to the next.

But after that, it just fell apart. The ABV was not balanced, IMHO, properly. Too much alcohol taste. The hops weren't very impressive, yes they were there, but showing up is only half the work.

37,129,Garin,3.85,"As I poured this into the glass, I was flooded with aromas of spice, herbs, and citrus. An impressive, thick, almost ice-cream head formed and actually grew over time, before it eventually calmed leaving a white and clingy lace. Wow. The colour was a mildly hazy, coppery gold in the centre, and a pale amber around the edges of the glass.  This one was very herby in aroma, floral, and yes -- I can easily find the basil that someone else mentioned. Grassy as well, and very strong barnyard. Someone said horse blanket, but for me it's more like horse urine. Wow, be ready for this one, this must be fermented with some seriously interesting yeast.  As I took a sip, I got a mouthful of head -- and it was as thick as pudding and hoppy bitter. In the beer itself, clean herbal and citrus flavours came through, with a healthy dose of bitterness throughout. Anise? Something bitterly herbal is in there as well. A medium body with nice carbonation keeps this one in reality -- otherwise it would be just too much.  I have to say that this was an interesting beer, especially for the aroma.

37,129,WVbeergeek,5,"The bottle alone makes this beer piece of art, along with the brewing tradition of the trappist ales this beer still being brewed by the monks of the Orval Abbey. Appears a slightly hazy amber brownish orange with a creamy crown of off white foaming head. A good friend of mine describes the aroma of this beer as a barnyard minus all of the cow shit smell. What I think he is referring to is the wild herbal spices that added to this beer, just amazing. The wild spices contain lemongrass, peppery orgegano like herbs, and the ultimate combination of malt and hop bitterness. The taste is a major wow, a grainy herbal spiritual experince exists in every sip mising spices and flavor galore. I love this beer and I must say I'm not worthy of it so complex, I feel that everytime I try it will contain another experience. Mouthfeel is smooth with a medium to light body, let's just say if you have the opportunity to try this one you have been blessed. Very drinkable, but best enjoyed one at a time to savor and enjoy all of the complexities this beer has to offer.  5-22-10 vintage date- 7/29/2009 best by 7/29/2014  This beer has an angelic experience about it, the slightly hazed glowing amber body just lets the beer gods sing down on you. The head forms chunky like clouds in the heavans. Lacing is fine intricate Belgian style all day. Aromatics bring out the barnyard funkiness that makes this a new experience everytime I've come across it, again more zestiness sharp citrus appeal from the hops with a spicy pepper kick that just works so nicely here. Acidic nature waves in as well bringing out lactic acid notes and cider like comparisons in my brain. The more yeast that makes it into the glass the funkier it gets. Drinkability and mouthfeel are great, definitely a brew I will always cherish.

OK, let me also say that I appreciate the complexity of this beer. It's is an incredibly well-crafted brew that had be wondering how I was going to describe it.  Let's move on to the appearance and get to the flavor in a moment. the Orval poured a dark gold, darker than I was expecting. The head was massive in it's mass...rising slowly above the lrim of my glass. The head had a very long life, with the appearance of clouds as seen from above. The head melted like ice cream.  The aroma was full of citrus and floral. OK, now to the flavor.  More than any other Belgian I've had, the Orval reminded me the most of a dry white wine. I was struck by the similarity. However, it is far more complex than to call it wine-like. The combination of lemon plus bitter and floral hops results in an interesting flavor.

37,129,canucklehead,3.78,"I tasted a new bottle and a bottle I had in the cellar for a year so this review is combination of both bottles.  The first thing you notice is the horse blanket aroma that dominates this beer. It is less pronounced in the aged version but make no mistake this beer is not for beginners. My father and brother-in-law couldn't get past the nose and taste even though they love and know trappiste beers. I however find this beer singularly good because of its strangeness.  Cellaring this beer smoothes out the edges and creates a poire william flavour that makes it almost sweet. The new bottle was rough and yeasty and at times almost too much for the palate.  I think everyone should try this beer and if it interests you,put a bottle or two away.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

It is not a restaurant, it is an experience. Pretty much what a basic Belgian brew should be. It offers a balanced nose with a full-bodied, spicey, yet not too spicey bier.

37,129,Darkale,4.5,"UPDATE, 12/7/10  On a whim, I bought an older bottle of Orval from one of my favorite beer stores, and I remain impressed with its unique, sharp, funky, cheesy goodness. This is a beer that must be revisited.  UPDATE, 2-18-07  Wonderful to see how one's tastes change. Three years after I wrote the review below, I bought another single bottle of Orval today and sampled it tonight. I was very impressed with its mixture of spice and alcohol, supported by a mouthfeel that seemed so much more lush than I remembered it. A fabulous sipper. A truly interesting beer, and I am happy to kick up my old ratings, across the board.  FORMER REVIEW  Orval comes in a beautiful, candlepin shaped brown bottle, with a simple label; the 11.2 ounces pour out in a cloudy butterscotch color, forming an immediate, lumpy, fizzy tan head with great resilience and lacing.  The aroma to me is not pleasant. Hint of fruit, but more than anything it smelled sour.  The beer is highly carbonated, brisk, almost brash in its carbonation; it made my cheeks tingle. The taste is of cinnamon and other spices, flowers, and hops. Drinkable because of the low ABV; fun to sip while it warms. But, overall, I find myself turned off by its bitterness; it's like very, very dry champagne, and there is a sourness in its taste that is similar to the sourness of its aroma.  Tremendous work obviously went into this beer; I'm glad that I tried it, but it's not a beer that I would seek out.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,ellman,3.68,Smell: Defiantly a Belgian beer it had a fruity musty smell with hint of the alcohol present.  Appearance: Medium orange brew with a long lasting full whit head.

Also slightly sour  Of the Trappist I have tried this is not high on the list but not bad at all.,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Quaffer,3.36,"Appearance: This was an orange brew with an incredible sustained bead. The head was thick and fluffy and just wouldn't go away, being fueled by all the rising bubles. It coated the sides of the goblet with lace, sometimes in solid sheets.  Smell: There were aromas of citrus fruit, spice, and alcohol. A slight malt smell was present, but it was not prevalent  Mouthfeel: Kind of rough and thin bodied. It improved somewhat as it sat.  Taste: There was hardly any flavor up front. On the finish there was a spicy sweetness and a grapefruit like bitterness. After a few drinks, I started to notice a slight malt flavor. A little bit of alcohol came through, but there was no warming effect to speak of.  This beer was just as I remembered it: very dry. I think that I enjoyed it more this time, but it is not one my favorites by any means. It is definitely my least favorite of all the Trappist brews that I have had.

Aroma is overwhelming and enticing from afar: extraordinarily spicy, very enticing and seductive, though I haven't even even brought this brew close to my nose yet. An arousing blend of the sweet and the sour, with some citric notes speaking up here and there. Loads of sugar and spice, and, well, everything nice. Fierce hops on the palate, and an excellent texture, great hop bite and play upon the tongue. Full of body and flavor. Long lasting finish. Delicious, with plenty of citric tang. Deeply satisfactory, very mellow and pacifying.This is a brew that tastes of the history it contains.

The flavor is incredibly assertive; I could detect almost no sweetness at all in the first sip. Lemony and acidic, the flavor profile is dominated by tart fruit and spicy tastes, followed by a big, earthy, floral hop finish. Overall impression in the mouth is very crisp, almost sharp. A bit harsh on the tongue for me with a very dry finish. I found that adding the yeast to the glass rounds the flavor out a bit and leaves a much more mellow beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

A deep reddish-orange colored beer, under a thick creamy head that was huge when it was first poured, but settled down to a quarter of inch head.

Very nice taste, almost lemony, with a little bit of yeast, but much more so. The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy, with just a hint of carbonation.

37,129,marburg,4.78,"Oh, my Belgian sweet, how I love thee...  Orval is far and away the most unique -- for better or worse -- of all the Trappists. But it's unique in a good way -- not odd but, rather, treasured. Pours with a lovely color and a head that looks like a beautiful, rocky glacier. The aroma is really pretty strong -- revealing all sorts of wild fragrances like yeast, pine sap, a barn interior, and some fruity sweetness -- and permeates the air for a couple feet around you for the first minute or so.  And the taste. Goodness, I love it. I'm a big fan of beers with a bit of a tart edge to it, and this is just perfect. It has a sour, acidic quality to it while maintaining a high level of drinkability. While some friends of mine have described it as ""tastes like a horse's ass,"" I find it engaging and unrestrained.

Very well..need I say I bought it? ;)  Firstly, credits for the bottle, like already mentioned in the earlier reviews, it looks really neat. :) I was very suprised when I poured up this hazy orange fluid, it really looks like blood orange juice. The head was furious, I had to be really careful here. It wasn't too foamy though so it settled quickly. The smell is complex, a bit sour and fruity touch of bitter orange.  A huge bitternes is makes itself at home one the palate after a sip, and it dares to stay there for a long time too! How nice of it to stick around. ;) However I don't think I can rate this one over Duvel like Gusler did, this one rates a little lower imho.

Start malt and lightly sweet, the top slim in feel on the palate, biting in its acidity, the hops perky in their spicy bite, the aftertaste quite dry and long lasting.

Spicy, sweet and tangy. Quite unique and enjoyable, but a little too light for a Belgian. 6.9% ABV. Absolutely worth trying, and I can see why some people love this beer. But for $4.50 a bottle, it's not much of a bargain (when I can get Duvel, Westmalle, Unibroue, etc. for less).

A hint of fruit (apples and pears). The aroma tickles the nostrils.  Taste: Dominant flavor is floral hops (aromatics), slight fruitiness, and a hint of oak.

Taste starts immediately quite bitter, combination of hops, flowers, and vegetable. There IS a balance by malt, hinting at sweetness withour ever becoming so. Retronasal aromas of mandarine-zest, hop shoots and olives, without the oil. Carbonation just perfect: the beer has a milder form of 'Champenoise'-pearl forming, as made with naturally mildly crabonated springwater. Mouthfeel neither chewy, neither watery. No new aftertaste, bitterness lingers on. Drinkablility is second bar none: this is the ultimate Belgian session beer: it gives richness, depth and easy drinking, just as you prefer at the moment given.

The most interesting trappist beer, from the only single-beer(besides petite orval) trappist brewery. This pours a BEAUtIFUL orangeish amber colour with vast amounts of rocky, white, rich head. The taste is a bit of a let down though. It is spicy and very fruity, but also medicinal in it's alcoholic taste. The after-taste is dry and very bitter(which I like)but it does tend to have a chloroseptic or cherry robitusin after-taste.

37,129,AtrumAnimus,4.45,This Trappist style ale is good - IT is not great but it is very good. Similar in character to the Chimay White. But I don't think is to be as good. Still a fine example of one of the few Trappist style Belgian ales left on earth though. This is a must try for the true Belgian fan. I would love to try it on tap someday.  Technical Info: This brew gains its unusual orangey color from the use of three malts produced to its own specification. Its character has some acidity and spicy sage notes comes from its own single cell yeast in its bottle fermentation.,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,bditty187,4.53,"Hazy, coppery-tawny-gold hue, a splendid color really, the head is absolutely massive, easily three fingers (on a soft pour no less). What a gorgeous ale! The retention is fantastic, similar to meringue, the very definition of perfect. It laces it thick rings, organized, chucky. The nose is impressive, bubblegum upfront, soft orange wedge candy too, and then hints of grapes and green apples, dashes of pepper, oily hops, and undercurrents of a barnyard. There is a lushness in the nose that I find unique, it is obviously hoppy but so damn soft with the fruitiness. It is very impressive, good potency as well. Inviting. On the palate the hoppiness is assertive and bitter. This is coupled with an amazing dryness that allows a white wine vinous plus influences of apples, pepper, and mellow kiss of horse blanket. The palate is wonderful and akin to the complexities of the bouquet. It is very bitter but very soft. The mouthfeel is similar brut champagne, albeit with much improved carbonation. The finish is done-dry, which is very appetizing; the pepper and hops bitterness is long lasting. The body seems a touch thin but it is workable, the carbonation is high. This aspect of the beer has grown on me, Id didnt care for this feature on my first few bottles of Orval but now the mouthfeel is a welcomed attribute. I wrongfully compared this to Duvel and it never stood up in my mind that was my fault. Orval is too unique and too noteworthy to compare, it is a different version of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale and in many ways better. I love Orval. Highly Recommended.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93

Intriguing nose full of white grapes, rosemary, fresh hay and perfumey hops. Very botanical. Taste is quite similar. Begins with a rosemary draped white grape sweet/sourness. Subdued flourishes of spice. Candy fruit sweetness (kiwi perhaps). Yeast pour adds doughiness and some farmhouse qualities, mostly in a grassy, hay-like sense. Recedes with a hefty blast of floral hops. Bitter, dry finish. Light medium bodied with loads of spastic large bubbles. On the thin side prior to the introduction of the dregs. Worthy of the praise.

The bier itself is a dark-golden, orangey color, with some cloudiness (a smidge of yeast may have crept into the goblet...). The predominant aroma I pick up is of grapes, with little else making its way to my nostrils. The body was not quite medium, more on the thin side, yet it was relatively smooth on the tongue. The taste, like the aroma, was heavily grape-accented, much to my dismay. There were other fruity, sourish flavors as well, and it had a distinctly dry finish.

Wonderful complex aroma, consisting mainly of ripe banana and clove. It's like I just got a bunch of fresh bananas and peeled one! Also detectable are fresh sliced green apple, dried fruit (maybe raisin or plum), and spicy hops. Can't say how great that aroma is, it's just overwhelmingly good! I feel like I'm in a fruit market. One of the most aromatically pleasing Belgian beers I've ever had. Cracked pepper jumps in with the first taste, then more of that fresh fruit that was in the aroma. Clove also floats around sporadically. Spicy hops are next, along with dried fruit. Malt is most noticeable with retro-olfaction. Very ""carbonated"" mouthfeel. Sharp melon rind-like hop twang in the finish. A medium body, but very fruity, spicy, and complex! This beer is so very good! It's well worth the $4.99 or so for the 11.2 oz. bottle in my opinion.

Perfume almost to the point of being intrusive, yet it invites you to delve into this immensely complex bitter beer. You are not disappointed, bitterness is very prevalent but other almost indescribable tastes abound. It really is so hard to explain this beer properly; Hop-Oils, Perfumes, Xmas Spices, almost Phenolic aftertastes  its all there. And the balance of these tastes, changes dramatically with its age. I have drunk Orval fresh, 1, 2, 3 and 5 years old. For me it is at its epoch between 1 and 2 years old. At 5 yrs old, it was flat and had no perfume or bitterness, and was very dank & musty, fine for a lambic - but not good for Orval. Also, if you intend to Cellar this beer, you MUST keep it Upright, Cool AND Dry  for the crown caps have a very nasty tendency to rust if the bottle is kept on its side, or somewhere damp, I know I lost a whole a whole Crate to Oxidation!!! Unique, Very Distinctive, and a One-Off Trappist that is quite ""English"" in a strange way.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,brewdlyhooked13,2.09,"Very distinctive bottle design makes this a classy pick. Massive bubbles on the pour, which I forgot about at first, creating a bubble overage. Impressive aroma, but something happened on the taste part. I know Michael Jackson loves this beer, but I must be too inexperienced to appreciate it. It wasn't until I was halfway through the half glass I had for the taste testing when it hit me - Robitussin. Robitussin and, and...olives? Yeah, olives and Robitussin. The initial sensation in the mouth is different, but it always ended up Robitussin.  After reading all the reviews out here, I owe it to myself to try this again (for a 3rd time) to see if I can taste some of the other things people are commenting on. I've had Duvel, this is nothing like that except for the alcohol content.  This beer had some interesting side components that I liked, but the taste is the thing.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Dogbrick,4.13,"Very pretty color, and thanks to the head it took me over a minute to pour. Not the best beer I have ever had but it was definitely unique and I enjoyed it. Belgian Ales are still new to me but I always appreciate them. Cloudy amber color. Complex aroma with candy and grapes in the nose. Malty, vinous, spicy flavor that stayed interesting throughout. At $4.50 a bottle I probably won't be trying this one often but it should be on everyone's list. I had a pleasant buzz at the end too.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,putnam,4.85,"Lunar-eclipse orange with a massive, stiff head. Another aromatic triumph. Pine needles, sourdough, orange peel and clove all take turns on the nose. There is a really medieval feel to the aromatics. This is the beer they drank in Middle Earth, all resinous, peaty and full of crackling wild enzymes. The flavors are pretty and refined, somewhat in contrast to the nose. Sourwood honey, nutmeg, and roasted starch appear. A dry beer overall. A very fine, powdery grain on the finish. One unique beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,beernut7,4.16,This is my first voyage into the tremendous world of the Belgian Trappist tradition. The bowling pin shaped bottles emanates a fruity strong aroma that literally fills the room. The pour into the traditional goblet is slow and the creamy head is thicker than harbor fog on top of the deep orange-brown sea. The Belgian yeast imparts a definitive fruity slightly earthy flavor character with a malty alcohol warmth tucked in deep. The mellow crisp hop character leaves a clean finish. A well rounded flavorful wonderful beer.,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,MJR,4.58,"Poured into a Belgian goblet, this beer shows off a beatiful copper red/orange color sitting under a huge fluffy, white head.  If you're not used to drinking Belgian beers, the smell alone is enough to keep you away...not me though. I love the unique taste that these beers have to offer and this beer is a stunning example of the Belgian brewer's craft. The nose is faintly floral and has an organic quality to it: leather, musty attic, horse farm, whatever you want to call it.  The flavor is a wonderful balance of light, fruity esters, hop flavors, and that same organic flavor that showed up in the nose. Smooth, extremely dry finish. Great mouthfeel...massive carbonation doesn't get in the way of the flavor opening itself up fully.  Drinkability really depends on how well you like this style of beer. My combined love for this style and the intense dryness of the finish demand another round.  One of the best Belgian beers I've encountered so far. Outstanding!",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Jdiddy,2.56,Pours a great sparkling copper color. The best part of this beer stopped there for me. I just did not like it. It tasted like a farm smells (if that makes sense). Something just does not taste right with this one. An unusual taste that I could not really figure out. Bitter but not in a good way. Like paint thinner would probably taste. I am sure I may stand alone on this one but I will not be trying it again.,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Bighuge,4.02,"The first thing I notice about this brew is the high amount of carbonation present. Need to pour this one carefully. The second thing I notice is a very strong aroma. Pretty nice. Somewhat fruity and phenolic. Some leather. And sweet candy. This beer is a chill hazed amber and shows an incredible amount of carbonation in the body of the beer as well. CO2 bubbles rising to the surface faster than I can remember in a beer for a long time. A huge sticky and rocky white head tops this brew. The taste is very forthcoming. Raw leather. Musty attic. Some bubblegum esters. Subdued fruitiness. Earthy, herbal and spicy. And fairly bitter to boot. This may not be my favorite Belgian beer so far, but I do like the character that this one shows. A light bodied beer that doesn't feel as carbonated in the mouth as it looks to be on sight. This is no La Fin du Monde, but it's nice in its own way.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,NeroFiddled,4.63,"Of all the Trappist beers, I feel that the Orval is the most distinctive and unique - and probably the most misunderstood (or disliked) of the group. It can be a challenging beer at first, but it has great character if given a chance. It pours a lightly hazy pale orange-amber with a dense rocky head that lasts; eventually dropping to a thin creamy covering and leaving a beautiful Belgian-lace throughout the goblet. The tiny bubbles rising quickly through the beer make for a delightful little floor show! The high level of carbonation that produces the strong head, also helps it to give off it's very perfumy aroma. Clearly, there are some earthy British hops involved, Goldings and possibly Fuggles, amongst other noble varieties. In fact, I think this is the only Trappist beer that is dry-hopped (w/ Goldings)! It's fermented with 2 strains of yeast giving it enticingly complex aromas of leather, mineral, and wood. Again, the carbonation gives the beer a spritzy mouthfeel, making the body seem a little bigger than it is. The flavor follows the aroma with lots of dried fruit, and a sometimes ""metallic"" and intense dryness, leading into a somewhat acidic finish that leaves you with a memory of the beer that is more refreshing than mouth-coating.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,BeerManDan,2.6,"One taste and I didn't like it. Everything up to the taste was appealing. After tasting it, it left me disappointed. In fact I couldn't drink the whole glass. Maybe I got a bad bottle, but if this is what I have to look forward to next time, I'm wasting my time and money on a no nothing beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Longstaff,4.71,"Thick, foamy head falls only in the middle and sticks to the sides of the glass. Deep golden color with reddish highlights. Slight alcoholic aroma. Hints of leather and sulfur in the palate. Dry finish with hop flavors and bitterness lasting on the tounge. Great apertif.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,ADR,4.12,"Nutmeg color, upcharging bubbles, 1/2 inch head that lasts. Spicy aroma, very wine-like. Very tangy with bitter notes as well, causes a pucker without a lot of citrus. Light-bodied despite a good amount of bottle feremented carbonation working its way out. Finishes extremely clean. There's a vinous and bitter flavor that's not for me, Bretts not working for me here. Obviously an icon in brewdom, Orval Trappist takes the Belgian Pale style to the limit. I'll give it a good rating on smell and across the board 4s on the rest. Not to my taste.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,marc77,4.18,"The head is absolutely formidable-- incredibly dense, rocky, thick and sticky. Combined w/ the copious, lively bubbling and clear, light amber hue, this beer is vibrant and visually appealing. The aroma consists of black licorice, pepper, green apple acetaldehyde and sweet orange candy - like notes, w/ just a hint of phenol in the finish. The flavor is comprised of caramelized sugar notes, w/ a hint of black pepper. Most striking about the flavor of Orval is the relatively assertive hop bitterness that prevents malt sweetness from becoming dominant. When combined with the relatively light body for style, Orval is almost dry, and is thus very drinkable. The finish is dry, bitter, and a bit tart. Although the flavor doesn't deliver on the promise of the aroma, Orval is still an intense and unique beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Wildman,4.12,"Okay, this is only my second Belgian. It has a wonderful light orangish amber color to it. Creates a nice light head, maybe due in part to it's colorful bubbly nature. This of course gives it a slightly fizzy taste. The aroma is different a mixture of citrus and others that almost imparts(to me at least) a bubblegum smell. It has a nice body to it and a good finish. I am more a fan of stouts/porters, but still quite enjoyed this.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,packetknife,4.62,"Dark copper maybe broze, solid white head that holds. An amazing array on the nose, smell often and long... citrus, apples, soil. Very hoppy with citrus and spice on the tongue. Nothing unlively about the beers, feels very different at each stage of touching your tongue, flowing over, and going down. I was very impressed. Expensive as sin but I'll make it a annual thing.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,stoutman,4.19,"Brewed at the Trappist monastery founded in the 1100s, this ale is fermented three times with three different malts and two types of hops. Unlike most Trappist ales, Orval has a powerful hop presence. It is a bitter-orange color, with a fruity and slightly sour bouquet. A wonderful hop bitterness and long, dry finish. Best served around 60F with stinky cheese or seafood.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,WilliamPhilaPa,4.38,"Pours a cloudy bronze with an orange tint in it's appearance. Floral hop aromas among other things on the nose. On the palate there was hints of pears and apple peals maybe, tiny sourness to it hard to explain but I enjoyed it a lot. Very nice alcohol kick but its not at all over whelming. Ends with a nice long lingering finish. I thought it was an excellent Belgian Ale. Very pricey though$4.99 for a single 11.2 Fl oz bottle...that's beat.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,StevieW,3.06,"I tried this beer based on the beer advocates reviews and was very dissapointed. Maybe I had a bad bottle, but it was very over carbonated, the head blew up into huge bubbles and poured over the glass. (I used a belgium glass-Corsendonk is the closest I had.) The color looked inviting enough, but the big citrus smell was immediate. The flavor was ok, but was overwhelmed by the carbonation. The freshness date was 01082005, which may explain the taste. Did I drink it too early ? In any event, it didn't live up to the expectations I had. Not a beer worthy of a National Championship game.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,John,4.05,"Cloudy amber liquid with good head and retention. Spicey with musty oak aroma. Complex, sweetish, spicey, malty, oaky, faint hop flavor. These characteristics blend extremely well when the brew warms. Interesting beer.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,rastaman,4.45,"A very good trappiste beer. Dry, hoopy, elegant, bubbly and just f***in brilliant, great beer and an absolute classic, i'd love to visit the monastry.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Reverand,5,The true Nectar of the Gods!!! If I had to be stuck on Island this is the beer I would take with me. With it's golden amber color to the incredible white head. The taste is impeccable an absolute frenzy on the taste buds.,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Jason,4.92,"Presentation: 11.2 oz vase like brown bottle, best before date stamped on the back.  Appearance: Orange amber (very light haze) in colour with a magnificent white head ... rocky and dense, leaving rings lace all over.  Smell: Hints of juniper, lemon and flowers.  Taste: Smooth and crisp with a lightish body though the mouth feel appears to be full up front. Touch of lemon rind with a fresh cut hay flavour, hop bitterness makes a snappy bite. Horse blanket and other medicinal phenols over take the tongue for a bit also. Tart from start to finish with hints of cider and other tart fruits. The finish seems to be everlasting in its dryness.  Notes: The sheer complexity of this fine ale is mind boggling ... one of the originals. This brew is all old school ... dating back to the 1100's. If you are into Belgian ales this will be a sure treat. Some soft cheese and dark rye makes a perfect pairing.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,BKotch,4.44,"I've only had one and had to travel to California (from Texas) for that. It reminded me a bit of Chimay Cinq Cents, but a little smoother, fruitier and drier. Update 12 years later: long available in Texas, this remains a go-to classic. Love the slight barnyardy character.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,mmthompson33,5,"A legendary beer. Drinking an Orval is a unique experience each time - the fruitiness, subtle maltiness and high alcohol make it one to remember. Not many beers can do that, and no beer has been able to imitate Orval. Orval has that aura that very few beers ever achieve.",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
37,129,Brent,4.94,"Definite aroma of pears. Beautiful fluffy head. Very snappy and sharp at the front, then settles down to a mildly fruity hops finish. Most Dubbels finish too sweet for my taste, and the reserved sweetness in this ale is appreciated. Very complex and smooth. Hoo-hah!",Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,93
