147,4083,FrankieKaufman,5,"The classic recipe delivers the double IPA that solidified my love of the double IPA. Overall, a perfect representation of the style. Everything you want for the style, including a rich amber color, hop forward flavor, perfect malt backbone and a bitter finish to deliver an amazing beer. Stone got it right with this recipe, and I am glad they brought it back to celebrate.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Ocalafox,4.5,"Look - aggressive pour with nice foamy white head, color is clear and copper, good lacing throughout. Smell - grapefruit, floral, Taste - sweet malt caramel, citrus pith, tangerine, spice, dank hops, resin. Big medium body with bitter carbonation that simmers to a soft, dry finish on the top of the tongue. Overall very enjoyable, a few 4 packs upon release but I'm more a fresh Jai Alai or Tropicalia kinda guy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,DavetotheB,4.32,"From a 12oz can dated ""packaged"" 12/27/22, ""best by"" 4/26/23 into a pint glass.  Pours a translucent golden orange with about one finger of white head. Excellent retention and lacing.  Smells pretty much exclusively of pine. Some light notes of dirt and grass.  Taste follows. Pine. Pine. Pine. Bitter pine.  Sticky mouthfeel with a strong, long lasting, bitter aftertaste. Medium carbonation.  This beer is as advertised and it's wonderful. Never had the OG, so the wonderfulness of this beer is ""as-is"" No comparisons necessary.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Bluerabbitbell,4.25,"Enjoying at home, 2/18/2023. Poured from a 12oz can purchased from Washington Beer Store. Look is beautifully clear in the glass, not much head, tiny bubbles ring the surface edge.  Aroma is pine, honey, apricot.  Clear amber color with minimal lacing or head.  Deep, earthy, lingering grapefruit rind with the perfect balance of sweetness that makes you think of dusting the top of your grapefruit half with sugar.  Velvety in the mouth. Coats the tongue and brings warmth to the chest as it descends.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Franziskaner,4.1,"Dark gold to light copper in color. There’s a half inch of off white on top. Moderate, soapy lacing. The aroma is of citrus hops and light malt. I’m tasting piney, lime, and lightly citrus hops. The mouth is dry, crisp, and a touch boozy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Braunmeister_1943,4.27,My first Ruination! I’m glad I bought a 6 pack of this!  Beautiful clear copper color with a nice creamy head. Mild fruity/ hoppy aroma. Balanced fruit/ piney flavor. This sure does not drink like an 8.2 abv Imperial IPA. I’m so glad that Stone brought this one back!,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,defunksta,3.83,"Appearance: Pours a completely clear, medium golden to slight amber hue with a large white head. SRM of 11. (4.00)  Aroma: Moderate aromas of grapefruit, pine, lemon citrus. (3.75)  Flavor: Moderate flavors of grapefruit citrus, lemon citrus, pine. Mild bitterness but it creeps stronger, leans sweet. (3.75)  Feel: Medium-bodied, strong carbonation. Sweet but also bitter finish. (4.00)  Compared to Stone IPA 2/2023: Pours slightly darker, milder head. Milder aromas. More sweet nectarine and citrus. Less bitter pine and citrus rind. Heavier and sweeter with less bitterness.  Overall: First try at Ruination here and it drinks pretty well. Resinous, nectarine, some grapefruit and piney notes to balance. Leans slightly heavier and sweeter and the bitterness is somewhat attenuated, but comes to play and creeps up here as it still is a Stone IPA. Similar to Stone IPA, but heavier and sweeter. More modern and sort of reminds me of Founders Centennial. (Rating: 3.83)",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,LucidoMMA,4.21,Pours a dark amberish color with a very retentive head.  Taste is a nice combo action of malt and hops. And it pretty much stays that way throughout fading Into a nice dry minimally bitter finish. 4.25,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,FRANKHAZE,4.25,"This beer has that quintessential wcipa flavor. Hoppy, citrusy, piney and malty. Simple, basic but delicious. Nice carbonation and mouthfeel.

147,4083,Luscious_Malfoy,4.44,"poured from a 12oz can into a CW snifter. pours a fairly clear but deep gold with hints of amber, yet gathers in the glass a see-through burnt orange with a creamy white foam cap of about two fingers. this has all of the candied orange and melon and apricot, dank, resinous pine sap and citrus one would expect from a west coast DIPA. the taste follows the nose but is complimented by a big malt presence as well as a sharp, dry finish. thick, full and fairly creamy mouthfeel. it’s pretty soft for such an aggressive and massive beer. really good stuff. seems these days that west coast IPAs take a backseat to the hazy new england ones but this one proves that when they’re done well there’s no need to compare as to me these offer quite a bit more complexity.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,augustgarage,3.83,"Packaged on 12/21/22 - consumed on 2/4/23. Poured from a 12oz can into a goblet.  Clear Hunyadi yellow body with a thin off-white cap receding to a lasting collar and surface slick. Very fine sandy lacing; faint, sticky, glossy legs. Decent retention.  Tangelo, candied ginger, and faint forest floor notes in the nose. Subdued (possibly more potent when super fresh?).  Resinous, grassy, herbaceous, hop-forward palate entry. Slightly tart/grainy center leading into a medium-dry, faintly woodsy finish. Citrus (grapefruit, orange, with a touch of lime) grows stronger as the ale warms up a bit. Slow, lumbering, persistent earthy/grassy bitterness throughout. Hints of caramel and cotton candy at times.  Oily yet a little thin with soft carbonation. ABV well concealed, though I wouldn't go so far as to call this a refreshing.  More than the sum of its parts in some ways - a show-case for traditional American hops, though presumably in such large quantities during the main boil that the contributions of any late additions (flame-out, whirlpool, dry hopping) are obliterated, though you don't pick up this beer for subtlety.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,MrOH,4.56,"Brilliantly clear light copper, nice white head, excellent retention and lacing Grapefruit, pine, resin, some tropical hop aromas over a light caramel malt RESIN, grapefruit rind, a little bit of caramelly malt.

147,4083,jkblr,4.19,"12oz can Packaged On 12/27/22 Enjoy By 04/26/23 poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp 8.2% ABV. The beer pours bright medium amber with prolific khaki colored head. The head recedes to a rocky cap and coats the glass in a web of lacing. The aroma is moderate in strength featuring pine, candied citrus, caramel malt and slightly earthy notes. The taste is resinous pine and thoroughly bitter. Additional flavors of caramel and dank earthy hops. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a semi dry finish. The residual malt sugar and hop oils provide a sticky lingering feel, but it's not overly sweet. Ethanol is notable in the taste and aroma. Overall, very good still and a crazy reminder of a bygone era in craft beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,VABA,4.6,"Pours a very nice hazy golden color. Aroma has resounding hop hints The taste follows the nose with abundant hop flavors and a very nice balanced bitterness A medium bodied well carbonated beer Very well crafted beer, this is definitely my favorite Stone beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Bitburger,5,Since a generation the best old style DIPA on the market. Unbeleavably smooth and yet dank mouth feel. Perfect balance of hops and malt. As they say: A LIQUID POEM,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,jvgoor3786,4.25,"Pours a deep golden color with one finger of sticky head and strong lacing.  The smell is strong pine and something a bit fruity.  The taste is strong, bitter pine with a little citrus rind.  The mouthfeel is medium body and medium/strong carbonation.  Overall, this is a fantastic west coast IPA. Well with keeping on hand.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,harrypowers,4.17,Pours a clear copper color with a 2+F foamy head and a lot of lacing.  Smells of grassy piney hops.  Tastes of slightly sweet malt and bitter hops with an alcohol warm finish.  Medium body and carbonation. Dry mouthfeel.  This is an old school west coast hop bomb. I like it but it is not for folks who are bitter adverse.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

This is a fantastic brew that really delivers on the bitterness scale. Reminds me of Arrogant Bastard Ale, loaded with an extra large helping of malt and tons of hops. A badass brew like this deserves a badass tune. Pair it with Holy Wars... The Punishment Due by Megadeth.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,NCSapiens,4.19,"Classic west coast IPA that is really good on tap. Bitter hops are the standout, with notes of citrusy lemon peel and orange, grapefruit, flower, soap, pine, yeast, and caramel sweetness.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Mindcrime1000,4.12,"Poured into a Nonic.  Pours crystal clear light copper. Decent head. Limited retention. Good lacing.  Pale malt and citrus aromas on the nose initially, with some floral notes in the background; and then pine resins slowly take over as the brew warms in the glass. Some caramel malt joins here as well.  The flavor is simple, straight, and pure west-coast goodness. Initial caramel malt sweetness on the very tip of the tongue is quickly met with a wash of citrus rind and pith in midstream. Some soapy flavor manifestation of the floral aspect arrives here before pine resin and white pepper heat (booze) arrive at the close. Not boozy for the style by any means, but the brew isn't trying to hid it either.  The brew never feels bigger than medium-bodied, owing to some excellent drying carbonation and booze. Dangerously drinkable as a result.  A top-notch DIPA for sure.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,AmeriCanadian,3.75,"I'm sure I've had this in the past at some point, but actually reviewing it in 2023 with a re-released version canned just after Christmas (12/27/22). So month-old can poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass.  Quintessential American/West Coast IIPA look: crystal clear copper-gold liquid, massive head of off-white, compact bubbles. Nice head retention and tons of sticky lacing. Highly effervescent, with continuous carbonation running up the sides of the glass. I can almost taste the sticky, piny, bitter hops just looking at this one in the glass. Only thing that would make it more of a looker would be a slightly darker body more indicative of the ABV.  Boozy and resinous on the nose up front. I love the latter, the former is a little much -- borderline ethanol. Behind the bold front is a wonderful blast of pithy citrus and sweet malts. A little red berry, dank grassiness, and lemon zest. Not necessarily a plethora of layers or component parts, but what's there checks the right boxes. Unfortunately the boozy vapors detract from the overall nose.  Same holds true on the tongue -- this thing is HOT. Thankfully the initial boozy blast tails off making room for the consistent notes from the nose that tickle the appropriate tastebuds on the tongue: bitter, pithy citrus (heavy grapefruit), bitter pine resin, with a touch of sweet, bready malts that keep it at least a little bit honest. But this thing is abrasively bitter with minimal balance. For a good, old school American IPA that's often what I'm looking for (albeit with a little more malt balance). But here the bitterness plus the heat is a definite step down from what the beer otherwise might be.  Mouthfeel is wonderful and surprisingly not sticky at all. Silky smooth and substantial, with a wonderful coating quality and a touch of chewiness, but somehow still semi-light and quaffable. Pretty fascinating combination that speaks to the excellent mix of liquid texture and carbonation.  This one gave me my abrasive (West Coast) hop fix, and it's scores extremely high marks on look and texture, but there are better examples of the style that nail the smell and taste (with less heat) at a world class level.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jzeilinger,4.29,"Canned on: 12-27-22  A - Golden copper colored pour with perfect clarity and steady, moderate carbonation, with a thin creamy layer resting on top.  S - Aroma is on the low side with light spicy citrus and light malt.  T - Flavor makes up for the weak nose. Some light caramel malt sweetness up front at the tip of the tongue before being crushed by a wall of spicy and citrus rind and ends with an agressive, lingering wave of resiny pine. The bitterness is definitely agressive.  M - Big medium body with prickly carbonation that simmers to a soft, dry finish on the top of the tongue.  O - I've had this several times in the past when it was available, why I never reviewed it, I'll never know. It's just as agressively bitter as I remember it. Really dig this Classic West Coast and so glad to see it back again!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Weisenbeer,4.42,"This is really great.... I have no idea where they are hiding the high ABV because the drinks much more smooth than a heavier beer with similar ABV ... Taste good, smells good, feels good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jonphisher,4.54,"Crystal clear copperish gold; off white head, very good retention; a thick film persists, very nice lacing.  Nose is all hops; very aromatic…slightly orange citrus at first, overpowered by pine that carries a light sweetness.  Taste is like biting into a hop cone; incredibly piney, citrus rind, lightly floral; only in aftertaste and linger very lightly amidst the pines, slight malt presence.  Big beer; high end of medium body, big mouth coating resiny and dry bitterness that linger and lingers…thus drink’s dangerously smooth; has an ever so light sinus warming hint of the abv…but the drinkability overpowers it, dangerous beer.  I wish I could drink a beer like this any time I needed my hop fix, this beer is a gem and damn near perfect for what I want in a IIPA",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,MonDak_Joe1953,4.39,"12oz can. Dating information stamped on can bottom is 'Packaged 12/27/22 Enjoy By 04/26/23'. Brought back as a special release. Clear, deep gold colored body. One finger of white head settles back to a skim and ring. Leaves partial walls of lacing. Aroma of toasty malt, with citrus and pine. Taste is slightly malty sweet but the main show is the display of hop flavors - orange, grapefruit, kumquat peel, and pine resin. Gets bitter late, and especially in the aftertaste. Medium plus mouth feel, with syrup. Dry finish from the bitterness. Very good carbonation. So pleased that this one has returned, and can be enjoyed fresh.

147,4083,dkoehler42,3.71,"Fair warning I don't know the age of this bottle. That being said, it doesn't seem as overpowering as I recall most Stone beers being. It pours a brownish gold with a whitish head. The smell and taste are a little funky, interfering with the malt flavors. The hops are still present, and the bitterness is still present and lingers. This would be a great pair to a rich or spicy food.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Pleasant aroma of fruity American hops (citrus, tropical fruits). The flavour is a violent hoppy attack from start to finish, a sweetish malty and fruity background is not enough to balance the bitterness. Original rating: Sampled bottle, RBNAG 2007 in Grimstad. Deep golden colour. Nice hoppy aroma, not as strong as expected. The flavour is VERY hoppy, maybe too much bitterness for me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,aficionado224,4.2,"This brew is strong and it's reasonable to expect anything named Ruination to be as strong as it is. It feels heavy and the flavor is about right for one positioned as a heavy brew.

147,4083,Wi_brew_bud,4,So it’s a good beer but it doesn’t finish its hoppy and bitter but boozy. I think that if it was a little be smother than it would be a winner. But overall it’s still a beer that should be a part of any IPA tour,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,kotocar,3.55,It's a Stone beer so it should be good right? If you're really into the style then you'll probably know there are better double IPA's out there. If you're not too much into the style you'll think this is too bitter and not entirely balanced.  The hops are there but what it lacks is something to sweeten it up just a bit. It needs more of a malt backbone. It almost tastes like I'm drinking hop water. The hops are too overpowering for me to really distinguish any of the malts.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

What?s left was disappointing considering how much I like stone?s standard IPA. Citrus pine nose. Yellow color. Overly bitter without the extra flavor to justify.

Good IPA, but I’ve had better.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Lone_Freighter,4.14,"Poured into a tulip, the appearance was a burnt rugged copper color with a finger's worth of eggshell white foamy head. Light lace glistened around the glass as the head died off. The aroma had some throat burning grassy to citrusy to piney hops, full and pummeling with a sturdy caramel/toffee malt base. The flavor was basically the same with that palate wrecking capable hop burn aftertaste. The mouthfeel was ""hot"" hop worthy with a good sipping quality about it. Carbonation felt fine. ABV felt right as projected. Overall, this is one of those palate wrecking capable DIPA's that basically subjugates your tongue into submission, which don't get me wrong, it's very well done, but not for the faint of heart.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,monkist,5,"An amazing double IPA! Actually the first one I've ever had, at that time I was dumbfounded. Now I'm drinking it again to write these impressions down. Very citrusy, grapefruity in the nose, Citra, Centennial, Amarillo perhaps? Zesty aroma hops backed up with huge amounts of bittering hops. Every sip you feel its citrusy zestiness but soon after comes the bitterness, similar to that of a grapefruit. As sophisticated as Stone is, this beer is not only about its taste but also its feel. They make legends with their beers, most definitely with this one, with their dark idol the Gargoyle snarling back at you from the bottle/can. All you can do is give in to the greatness of this hoppy beast. Very fruity though, quite unusual of double IPAs, also not that heavy on the body - but tough and intense, the flavors come in a multitude, bombarding you as its taste keeps changing. No matter how bitter it becomes, as it soothes out it leaves a very pleasant aftertaste. Perfectly created and brewed, classical IPA, a must for all to try! The first time I had this I could not dare to imagine that Stone ever made anything better, but honestly this is only the introduction to their greatness...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,maxdeusphallis,4.03,"Mostly pine on the nose. Not juicy.  Slightly hazy orange/amber.  2 finger head. Nice looking beer.  Taste is resinous pine - a little grapefruit / citrus white rind bitterness. Nice malt / biscuit flavor.  I have to agree with some others - very nicely balanced. A very well crafted beer.  It's almost ""sticky"" on the backend with some alcohol burn. But no intense booziness.  Nice IPA but sort of so well balanced nothing stands out.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Its palate fatigue, but the good kind. Covers alcohol relatively well, the massive ibu payload is all up on you.

Fairly bitter from the start, so is a gentle transition to the bitter finish. No sharp division or bite to the hops. Bitterness lingering on tongue infused with earthy and pine flavors...not the fruity modern hops.  Medium body and carbonation. No astringency, and honestly very little alcohol warming considering the 8%+ ABV.  Liked this beer more than I remembered. Insanely hoppy, yet nuanced at the same time.

147,4083,taxandbeerguy,4.5,"355 ml bottle served just above fridge temperature into an Amsterdam Boneshaker IPA snifter. Purchased while in Niagara Falls, NY. Appears to be the original Ruinstion, no freshness indicated. Probably not the freshest, but given the higher alcohol, this could be a DIPA / Barleywine cross by this point.  Appearance - a hazy but bright coppery orange color, topped with a finger and a bit of dense white foam that leaves behind a small ring of lacing. Sufficiently hazy so that the carbonation is not visible.  Smell - huge citrus nose, mountains of grapefruit, with some sweeter pineapple, some thick grains that have been roasted and a caramel undertone to the whole beer. One of the most appealing DIPAs I've ever run across.  Taste - monstrously hopped but yet restrained like a barely caged animal. Big dose of grapefruit bitterness, some earthyness and a roasted grain that nearly has a smoked element to it. Very interest, complex and of course intense. Some spiciest to wrap everything up although maybe it's just extreme hops.  Mouthfeel - smooth and full of hop oils yet not inherently oily. Prickly carbonation and full but refreshing body. Amazing feel.  Overall - completely worth the purchase and top notch even if a little past it's prime. The intensity is staggering but it all comes together in a way that is pleasing. Just a great beer that I'm glad to have tried as it rides off into the sunset. Now I need to try ruination 2.0 to compare.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,DMXLOX22,4.71,"Picked up a single of this brew at my local establishment, Civeras in Drexel hill, PA. Let's see how it goes, excited to be one of he first customers to grab it at the deli.  Appearance: Pours a dark, malty, yet fluorescent, pale copper brown. As the dust settles, leaves a 1 inch head behind, somewhat decent lacing and somewhat aggressive bubbles of carbonation.  Smell: upon first inspection, I notice an explosion of hop aroma. Heavy pine and grapefruit scents come through. Some malt aromas kick in towards the end to give a nice balance to the floodgates of hops.  Taste: obviously, the first observation is the explosion of hop flavors on the palate. Grapefruit, deep pines, and a slight hint of orange-like zest hit the tongue and present a heavy ""mosh pit of hops"" as the label describes. I'm not sure more than one is warranted under normal circumstances. This brew brings the ruckus, and it's delicious, yet means business.  Mouthfeel: semi-heavy carbonation, over average body and has a somewhat clean finish, yet sometimes buttery towards the end. Pretty good.  Overall: Coming into this brew, I was excited, since I consider myself an IPA fanatic. This brew was bit of a tough one to digest. Heavy on the hop flavors and it completely satisfies. I'll definitely try again and would totally recommend to a friend. Cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

As in, as soon as I crack the bottle open the whole room smells like bud. Beer pours pale straw yellow in color, and forms a large white soda-like head. Extremely pale in color for an IPA of this gravity.  I remember trying this beer maybe 10 years ago, and finding it undrinkably bitter. Now I've raised my tolerance towards, and interest in, heavily hopped beers in that time, and I dare say the world has gotten better at brewing them. But sure enough, this beer is still just plain bitter on the palate. It's just a mess of entirely too much alpha in the middle of the palate. Admittedly, that doesn't make it undrinkable.

Flavor is hop forward with dry, piney and citrus hops, orange citrus, hint of dankness, light carmel malt, finishing with lingering resinous pine and grapefruit rind with hints of lemon and orange citrus. Medium bodied with active carbonation. A nicely made seriously hop forward IPA with a resinous, but not particularly herbal hop bill. The malt body was sufficient to support the intense hops, but was not in itself memorable. A quite enjoyable, well named hop bomb. I will not even try to taste another hoppy beer for a day or so.

S: Dank, pine, resin, wet and herbal, earthy, grapefruit rind, passion fruit. Caramel malt base backs up all the hops.  T: Hops come out with brute force. Earthy, strong pine and resin, herbal and spicy, cannabis, grapefruit rind. Stiff jab of alcohol. Fleeting bubblegum. Big malt flavors of caramel and toasted grain put up a good fight, but the hops soundly defeat them for overall dominance. Long, bitter and oily hop finish.  M: Hefty malt body and a creamy and silky texture. Carbonation scrubs briskly with fine bubbles. Some gripping astringency.  O: This is an awesome beer, and one that really helped to define the style. It's a shame to see it go. It stacks up with the best of them, but competition in the ipa categories is brutal these days and consumers have proven to be very fickle. Brand loyalty is a thing of the past and drinkers are obsessed with what's new and trendy. Rather than trying to breathe new life into some of their flagging classic core brands, Stone seems to have chosen to get on the same wavelength as the average craft beer geek and offer a constant flow of new, quirky, collaborative brews. Adaptation is necessary in a fast-paced, ever growing and changing industry like this, and so far their strategy seems to be working. Their social media game has been great at supporting these new beers and even creating demand to a certain extend too. However, the danger is overloading markets, especially slower non-metro ones, with more skus than their shelves can handle and causing a traffic jam within their own portfolio. Managing all these new skus and one-offs is going to be a juggling act on all three sides of the industry.  Now I'm rambling. These problems are not unique to Stone. Many breweries face the same issues, especially in the more competitive markets. I bet Ruination 2.0 will be excellent anyway.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Beyond the sharp bitterness I got a lot of that piney flavor, I just had a bunch of Alpha Kings a few months back and this reminded me of a ""bigger"" version of that beer. This is a classic but I respect Stone for rethinking some of their beers that have been around for a while that people might be taking for granted. Hopefully version 2.0 does this one justice.

Lots of bubbles, evidence of active carbonation.  Nose is lots of pine and citrus. Very bitter from the get go, and also quite floral. Typical Stone IPA aroma, very sharply bitter citrus and floral.  Taste is orange peel, grapefruit juice, and pine. The malt is there as faint and cracker-like presence, just enough to uphold the onslaught of hops. It finishes fairly dry with a long-lasting and pungently bitter, resiny aftertaste. Not for novice IPA drinkers, but definitely something a seasoned lupulin fan would come to crave.  The mouthfeel is medium. Perhaps slightly heavier than Stone's regular IPA, but not by much. Carbonation is medium and makes it very drinkable.  Overall, this is basically Stone IPA on steroids. It's not too different except for being slightly hoppier and stronger. No alcohol is perceptible, but I can tell it's stronger by the thicker body. Very good beer. Highly recommended for any IPA fan.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,majorbase2,4.32,"Pours a lively, slightly hazy orange color with a big fizzy, white foam head. Recedes to a very thin layer with good lacing around the edges and sides.  Smells of strong citrus and floral hops. Good deal of bitterness. A bit of pine. Just the slightest hint of some bready and caramel malts.  The taste starts with the citrus hops from the aroma, and a great deal of bitterness. Grapefruit and mango. The pine isn't overpowering and actually forms a tasty trio combined with the citrus and bitterness. Speaking of, not agreeing with the people knocking this for the bitterness. Yes, this beer is bitter, but it accomplishes it whilst allow the other flavors to showcase themselves.  Medium bodied. Not too much carbonation. Despite the bitterness, I was able to down this one in no time, and could do a few more. A bit resinous, which makes it a little more difficult to chug.  Overall, I really enjoyed this one. I would like to try a fresher one, as this one was actually quite close to its drink by date. Still thoroughly enjoyable. If you like bitterness, this one's for you.

Definitely a must try for hop heads and, like all Stone beers, its huge hop bitterness is balanced by a letting the malts shine through early and late in the tastes. Right on - my only complaint is that this could be even more hoppy if it were to live up to its name. I would compare this to favorably with Six Point's Resin but put it below Green Flash West Coast IPA. There is something a little commercial to the flavor, too smooth so to speak, that is also present in most Stone beers.

147,4083,DaverCS,3.96,"Absolutely gorgeous colored beer. Soft orange and slight golden hue. Light lacing with nice tiny bubbles streaming from the top.  Aroma is quite forward with the hop citrus and floral notes. Definitely heavy in the hop department just based on the nose. Some nice under-ripe lemon and grapefruit rind on the nose as well. Slight pine aroma.  Taste isn’t as great as I would have thought. Still their best IPA is Enjoy by. This beer just doesn’t live up to it. It is full of hops, so if that’s what you are going for then this may do it for you. It’s not all that well-balanced. Immediately your mouth is coated in a thick-bitter hop taste. You get some nice citrus notes near the middle and some slight pine, but these true beautiful flavors are short lived. The end flavor is just a harsh un-wanted bitterness that lingers and stays for too long. It prevents the next sip from fully being experienced due to this. I like bitter IPA’s, but I don’t like harsh IPA’s. This one doesn’t allow the citrus to play through, nor does it have the malt to cut back the bitterness to make the beer enjoyable while drinking. It tastes thick and bitter. Not my idea of a great IPA… their Enjoy By is what they should stick to!  Overall, this isn’t worth the time. Not well-balanced and just too harsh in terms of bitterness. The beer gets thick and overcoats the palate. The beautiful citrusy nose isn’t allowed to shine… Bummer. This really doesn’t pair too well with that many foods, but If I was to pair food with this beer, I would have to go with a spicy bowl of ramen. The spiciness will help compete with the level of bitterness of this beer. I give it a 79/100.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I have several of these and most pour amber with a slight haze that grows brilliant as the beer warms. Occasionally I get one that is cloudier but it is still good. The 1"" creamy, off-white foam collar produces thick sheets of lace that break into classic gothic cathedral window designs as they dissipate. A rich hop palate with some citrus rind bitterness rides on a solid malt backbone seasoned with yeast driven fruit flavors and a hard to pin down spiciness that give way to long, lingering hop aftertastes. An initial sweetness tempers the hops. Medium body to a little above and medium low carbonation. A true classic.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Radome,4.2,"L - Slightly cloudy; dark straw color with some orange. With lights around it, it seems to glow from within the glass. The head is white, and sticky with lots of lacing, but is not overly persistent.  S - Strong citrus hops with an herbal note in their background. Malt is equally prominent with sweetbread and brown sugar aromas. Very well balanced and appetizing in the nose.  T - Flavors are hop-forward. Sharp grapefruit with some earthy and herbal flavors as well. Malt flavors are muted in the background, but contribute some low biscuit. Flavors end quickly in a dryish finish.  F - Medium body. Super strong, puckeringly sharp hops bitterness. Moderate alcohol heat. Low carbonation.  O - The aromas are superbly balanced and inviting. However I don't think the flavors live up to the promise. For me this beer is over the top on hops sensations and flavors when a double IPA should have more malt to balance.

Missing the haze and deep colors of other DIPAs. One finger of flat white head which fades to a permeable cap with a slight collar and little lacing. Low retention. Very light visible carbonation. Foamy apple juice is a good comparison.  S: Powerful dank pine, syrupy malt sweetness. Hop bitters in a resinous concentration. Very light citrus, sweet caramel malt, traces of honey... nothing remarkable.  T: Assertive hop bitterness up front, followed by a wave of oily pine, hints of apricot, and a finish of sweet caramel malts that compete with a drying bitterness. Has a certain dirtiness to it.  M: Medium body, prickly... but not the kind from carbonation. Slick and stingingly bitter.  O: Maybe I just happen to prefer more aromatic/floral/balanced DIPAs, but this was very underwhelming. In no way do I find this to be world class, as to me it simply comes off as another bitter West Coast hop bomb.

Hazy from all of the hops with beautiful head and strong lacing.  S - Extra strong hop fragrance with lots of citrus, herbal, and resiny tones. Could smell it before I picked it up. Almost perfume like from the magnitude of aromatics.  T - Full flavored with a pungent hop character that has citrus, resin, herb, and some fruit with alcohol and malt to round it out. Strong bitterness but there is so much flavor that I feel it just adds to the full DIPA experience. Some may be taken back by the bite but I just relish in the glorious hops.  M - Full mouth-feel with good carbonation. This is definitely a big beer in pretty much every way but I could drink more than one without stripping my teeth.  Overall, a very good DIPA. Great aroma, flavor, feel, appearance, but does have substantial bitterness and some bite to it so it might not be the best beer for your first DIPA.

Taste- is refreshing at first and you get that super west cost piney hoppyness, no alcohol flavors, but as soon as you swallow it, it leaves a loooong term lingering bitterness on your tounge that drys you out, wish that there was more presence of sweet malts to back up the bitterness.  overall its a great beer, but i feel like there are far greater West coast IPAs than this that get much lesser ratings.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,leaddog,4.59,"Appearance - Pours a hazy amber with a finger of bubbly white head.  Smell - citrus and piney hops, tropical fruits (passionfruit, mango), grapefruit rind, touch of pine resin, bready caramel malts.  Taste - Nice punch from the bitter citrus and piney hops followed by the tropical fruits (passionfruit, mango), bitter grapefruit rind, pine resin, and bready caramalts.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Finishes with a pleasant bitterness from the citrus and piney hops and bitter grapefruit rind.  Overall - A stellar DIIPA from Stone. All fronts were well executed that make this a true stand out. I enjoyed the finish in this brew - nice bitterness from the hops and bitter grapefruit rind. This is a definite seek out who like their very bitter DIIPA's vs the more balanced ones.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Niceroad77,3.75,"I've noticed that this IPA has gotten rave reviews but here's my grain of salt. It does sell as a very hop forward beer and believe me when I say I truly love IPAs. But just like any other beer, a good IPA has to be balanced. This Ruination IPA is everything but balanced. It is very bitter yes (which I don't mind), but the aromas are simply off. Yes it is 100 IBU and so what? I had many other high IBU IPAs and believe me that it is a fine art to balance them. This one is not.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,IPAGeorge,4.5,"Poured into a tulip. Nice golden color, a bit hazy, 2 finger head. Floral, biscuity aroma. Taste is very well balanced. Slightly floral taste hinged by piney afterthoughts and just enough bitterness to knock it back down to enjoyable level. Very well done. Very easy drinking and satisfying beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,brurevu,4.5,The beer poured a crystal clear golden amber with a decent white head. The aroma was of grapefruit and citrus with a hint of tropical fruit and a sweet malt underneath. The taste is aggressively hop forward and takes your palate on a hop journey from beginning to end. After you get over the initial hop overload you get loads of citrus and grapefruit rind that peaks with a malt sweetness and ends with an intense pine palate coating. The Ruination has a nice malty sweetness that helps balance the heavy hops and dry finish. This is a top tier palate numbing hop bomb of a Double IPA. Just because its readily available don’t overlook this excellent brew.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,CalgaryFMC,4.71,"Welcome to Alberta, Stone Brewing Co. And welcome to my belly, Ruination. A pale cloudy peach hue with some fluffy, frothy whitish head that coalesces down into a more manageable and firm puck floating on the top of the aromatic liquid below. Nice lacing on my mason jar style mug. Immense hoppy aroma, full of citrus rind, floral perfume, tropical fruit juice, and pine needles. A subtle sweetness almost like those candy cigarettes. Citric, floral, assertive yet not abrasive, almost cleansing in a way. As for the taste, believe the hype. I do not dole out perfect scores very often; in fact, this might be the first occasion. Basically the Platonic ideal of a DIPA. Comfortably medium-bodied and supremely smooth with gentle carbonation, incredible drinakability for such a big beer. Epic heavy duty marmalade citrus flavors, getting lots of tangerine, grapefruit, and lime, with a little sour lemon and green banana in the finish, along with further pineapple, papaya, and nectarine notes. So much rind and resin yet nothing coarse and astrigent .... Perfect sublime hop balance. Bready honeyed malts also make their presence felt although the citrus fruit keeps wrestling away my attention. Brace yourself for the finish, peppery resins and a huge pine bite, although again, somehow the beers falls just short of too much bitterness, reigning itself back towards a reassuring citrus/tropical vibe that one could exult in for days, liver permitting. Not much more to say ... Essential imbibing for the hop head and even the aspiring hop head ready to learn via experience (alternatively, I am a sadist for recommending a beginner try this ... You be the judge).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Drippy, semi-resilient lacing.  S- Dank, musty hop aroma with a sharp alcoholic edge to it. Minimal bready malt presence.  T- Hop flavor sets in with pine, some citrus and a bit of grassiness. Bitterness is certainly high but not as high as expected as the taste of the hops are still allowed to be seen.  M- Moderately sharp hop bite and very oily feel.

Definitely rrecommended!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BethanyB,3.83,"Look: A beautiful beer. Medium gold and brilliantly clear--a feast for King Midas' eyes. The large, soft, white head is perfection, leaving plenty of lacing on the glass.  Smell: Smells strongly of grassy, resinous hops, with earthy tobacco and orange peel coming through on the second whiff. Pale malt is detected in the form of lightly toasted white bread. Nicely complex and well-balanced, but lacking Stone's ""something special"" that tells you you're in for a heck of an IPA.  Taste: The hop bitterness is moderate, less than expected. Unfortunately, the lack of bitterness is not balanced out by the flavor department. The hop flavor presents itself as a less complex, yet well balanced version of the hop aroma. Sadly, it seems to vanish in the finish like a phantom. Only light bitterness lingers the tongue as a sign of any hop presence. A very light taste of buttery caramel tries to push its way through, but doesn't quite climb to the levek needed to make this beer any more interesting.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is smooth and sessionable. The carbonation is merely mild, giving this beer less of the sting found in other imperial IPAs. Very light alcohol warming. A bit of creaminess is just noticeable enough to give it A bigger presence.  Overall: I expected much more from Stone, but this is still a fine IPA with some tasty, well executed elements. And yet, the beer feels like it was based on a good, yet unfinished recipe. Every element is lacking that extra characteristic required for making this something memorable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Some citrus and caramel malt, but lacks the vibrant citrus quality I got in the nose. Bitter and dry on the back end. Hoppy and delicious.  M - Medium bodied with good carbonation. Dry finish.  O - I have been waiting to review this one until I could find it fresh in my area. Typically the bottles that sit on the shelves around here are approaching/past their expiration dates. I jumped at the chance to get a growler filled. This is a beer that others in the style should be measured against. Great hop presence, but not overpowering.

147,4083,mvanaskie13,4.51,"Poured into a sam adams custom glass: color is gold, bubbles are uniform in size, head is off white, dense and lingers well with small lacing; carbonation is quite high but nice to watch.  Smell is clean, pale malt, clean fermentation leaves the idea of nice dry mouthfeel; hops are bitter upfront, nice blend of pine, earth, grass and grapefruit. Aroma is very enticing.  Taste and flavor is near perfect for a dipa: great malt notes that are overtaken by the hop bitterness and flavor, which is well done. Hop flavor follows the aroma, pine, grass, earthy, grapefruit and maybe some lemon rind as well. The beers simple malt profile, clean fermentation and hop power is truly exceptional.  Mouthfeel is great on this beer, the hop bitterness that is present and the dryness from the fermentation are not overpowering even at 8+% abv. There is a subtle caramel/biscuit softness that lingers and softens the blow of the hop bitterness, a great quality in a big ipa.  Overall, this brew is practically off the charts good: clean malt flavor, clean/dry fermentation, great bitter and flavorful hop profile and near perfect mouthfeel.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,SpenCycle,4.54,"Bottle. Extremely clear. Lots of lacing on the glass. First taste is like a normal extra IPA. As soon as it gets to the back of the mouth, it turns super bitter. It's like biting into a lime or grapefruit rind. The super-bitterness comes only after the swallow. No hint of the near 8% alcohol. Amazingly smooth. Extremely crisp, extremely hoppy ale. It's worth the $8 for the 22oz bottle. But only once. I had to taste this beer and it was worth the price. You will buy this once, but if you like this beer, you will settle for the SN Torpedo or the Founders Centennial IPA. The 100+ IBUs don't show up until after you swallow. Crisp, clean, bitter.

147,4083,gr0g,4.12,"I never posted a BA review for this before the recipe change (which I did not find out about until recently), and though I haven't had Ruination in a while, I'll try to note any differences.  Pours a hazy light amber with a two-finger head. Head retention is very good, as is the lace formation. Aroma is big-time citrus with some minor pine notes. Pineapple, but especially a pungent grapefruit are present. As aromatic as a DIPA should be, though it isn't as pleasant as ""new-school"" hopped beers like Enjoy By.  Taste follows right along with big hop bitterness throughout, finishing clean with little aftertaste. Grapefruit-like citrus dominates on the palate, but there's a definite underlying malt heftiness that differentiates Ruination from Stone IPA. While less dry than that, it's not that sweet a DIPA. Despite the increase in ABV from 7.7 to 8.2%, there is no perceptible increase in booziness. A well-carbonated beer, Ruination remains relatively soft with abundant hop oils.  Ruination was a big beer even before the change and remains so. It was very hard to note any significant changes at all. Despite Chinook being in the mix, the ""pine factor"" did not seem to increase. While I think it isn't quite an elite DIPA anymore, Ruination is still a great showcase for extreme hoppiness.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The head leaves great rings of lacing on my glass.  Aroma is pure west coast hops. Very resinous and piney. Wonderful notes of orange citrus. There's a hint of caramel sweetness, but it is clear the hops are the star here.  The taste begins with an orange citrus impression. This moves to a resinous flavor as found in the nose. The finish is unique with a very strong hop flavor that is very bitter. Almost too bitter, yet as the flavor lingers on between each sip there is a sweet caramel flavor that grows and carries on.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A classic from the Stone portfolio and I was happy to have it again. It is interesting how the more recently concocted IPAs and double IPAs contrast from this classic west coast American brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

This bomber I have had is extremely bitter, fine, but with NO piney resin, grapefruit notes, etc. that you expect from a West Coast IPA.  I just really don't like this one. Way too bitter for me, and without the juicy hop notes that I really like in some IPA's. It's just not my thing and I love Stone's Enjoy By.

By about 2 months the aroma has faded a lot, leaving mostly the pine. Still good, but as with most IPAs fresher is better.  Taste: Not surprisingly, this is very bitter up front, with the bitterness sticking around into a sturdy malt backbone. Aftertaste fades slowly. Bitterness grows as it warms.  Mouthfeel: Fine carbonation and moderate thickness give this a creamy feel, but the lack of any residual feel leaves it crisp.  Overall: My favorite IPA. Hoppy, hearty, and clean. It is not that any one component is so unique; it all just fits together perfectly for me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,JohnG190,4.7,"Pours a pale gold, much lighter than most DIPAs, with a thick bright white head that dissipates slowly to a nice foam cap. Little lacing to speak of. The aroma is subtle, but definitely hints at the hop bomb that will assault the tongue. Lots of sweet tropical fruit and bitter, pithy grapefruit dominate with hints of other citrus and a hint of caramel. On the taste, there is a burst of sweetness followed by a wave of astringent bitterness. Ruination is aptly named, yet quite balanced thanks to the strong malt backbone.

The nose is full of citrus and other fruit: a big orange aroma, grapefruit, lemon, pear, pine needle, subtle black pepper, and a malt characteristic of biscuit and caramel. At the front of the tongue I get a nicely balanced grapefruit and biscuit malt taste, then this thing explodes into a resinous, earthy, dank assault on the palate. There's bitter herbal and pine notes on the end, which are cut by sweet caramely malt. Yes, it's an extremely hoppy beer, but it has plenty of balancing elements.

Pretty fingers of lace stick around as the very good head retention fades.  Aromas are of citrus hops plus tropical fruits such as mango and pineapple. Very nice nose.  Taste is heavily bitter in the first sips, followed by some caramel malt flavors on the back end. The 100 IBUs make for a somewhat harsh taste, but it is still good overall.

S - massive hops, dominated by piney citrusy and grapefruit notes. Strong sweet and sticky malt character wafts through, with a slight fruityness.  T - very fresh tasting example, hop dominant up front, less piney as the nose more of a citrusy herbal tea flavor. Malt provides a very strong body and sweetness to keep the hops in check. Finishes less bitter than I expected, and actually a little sweeter than I would prefer.  M - thick n syrupy for the style, very stone-ish in its feel and is just delightful.  O - overall, as expected very enjoyable stone quality. Great fresh hop nose and flavor with a sticky and sweet body. Finish is clean but a little sweet and less bitter than I would expect.

I'm not a huge fan of their other offerings, but I like their IPAs.  This is very good example of the overhopped IPA style. Pours a very nice light caramel/toasty golden brown. The nose is extremely nice, there's a hint of citrus/lemon, then grass, then (as it gets a little warmer) a stronger, almost herbal/woodsy sort of aroma under that.  The initial hit is of lemon/grassy hops and is quite pleasantly bitter/biting on the tongues. Smooth and silky going down at first, with some lemon peel in the back, then finishes with a soft wash of bitterness and then, a bit further down the pike, another hit of grassy hops.

Smell- Big time citrus. Bready malts hiding beneath the citrus cover. Sweet aromas of pineapple and orange.  Taste- Earthy pine with a fresh biscuit like flavor. The floral and sweet qualities are apparent. The sweetness on the back end mixes well with the bitterness. Not as bitter as I thought. The malt/hops blend great and make this easy drinking.  Mouthfeel- Moderate, but still on the thin side considering this is a DIPA that is over 8% alc. Just the right amount of carbonation.  Overall- A smooth ale that goes down easy. Not insanely complex but a good example of the style. Stone knows how to make a brew right.

Tons of great lacing left inside the glass. Aromas astringent hops, lemon some pine. Tastes of lemon and a bitter astringency that just coats the palate and lingers on and on and on and on. Which should be expected (and is welcomed by me) with a name like Ruination. Really loved this beer and was really happy to be able to find this one as fresh as I could when I went out on my monthly beer run!

A: Pours a foggy honey orange color with a moderately large foamy white head that retains nicely, but eventually fades to a creamy cap that seems like it'd stick around for the rest of the night (if the brew lasted the rest of the night). Lots of sticky lacing left behind.  S: No surprise in the nose here. An epic aromatic tale of hops, with strong grapefruit and herbal and floral notes. Some pine and grass as well, but this one lingers more towards citric rather than rustic. Superb, either way.  T: Gloriously hoppy. Overflowing with grapefruit, lemon zest, bits of orange peel, a little grass, a dash of pine, and a bit of honey-like sweetness from the malts that's expertly blended with the flavors to add just a small semblance of balance. Honey lingers on in the aftertaste as well as some bitterness towards the back of the mouth. The booze is completely masked. Not a single trace.  M: More towards a full-body that's wonderfully creamy and sits kind of heavy on the palate, which truly allows the flavors to shine. A crisp, bright carbonation does well to keep this from feeling TOO creamy. I can't detect alcohol on my tongue, and the only hint that it's even present is the lingering warmness in my face and throat. Terrifyingly drinkable, this one is.  O: I've gotta hand it to them... Stone may be arrogant, but it's rightfully so. I'm starting to believe these guys (and gals) can do no wrong when it comes to beer.

After the good thing's I heard about this beer I said to myself I must try but did come out a little disappointed.  Edit: Don't know what I was talking about, damn novice beer drinker I was. I hadn't tried this one since I last tasted it and my how the palate changes and appreciates a solid IPA. Grapefruit, piney and grassy.

S: Strong fruitiness up front (grapefruit mostly) with an earthy tone and a malty background  T: Awesome profile that starts with a fruity, grassy tone with the hops very clearly present to give it the bitter undertones. The label states 100+ IBU but it hides behind (kinda like an elephant would hide behind an SUV) the other complex, fruity (not sweet!) flavors of this great brew. The finish is my favorite of any beer I've had to date, a smooth balance of the alcohol, hops and Jesus they use in this fine beverage.

Light body with a smooth texture. Just enough carbonation to give a light effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is pretty much one dimensional - hop flavor (grapefruit over pine) flows to a prominent hop bitterness which resembles grapefruit rind.

The mouthfeel is traditional dipa, medium bodied and mouth coating. The flavor is everything the name and nose promises, nothing but palate numbing hoppy bitterness. Like being socked in the tongue by a lemon, a grapefruit, and a bag of pine needles. This beer is not well balanced nor well crafted, but it us exactly what it vows to be; an utterly mouth destroying, taste bud ruining hop bomb of an ale(imagine a less fresh version of Hopslam).

S - Very shy nose,even after warming up, of Grapefruit, citrus, and pine.  T - Grapefruit hits you right off the bat with hints of malt. This brew is all about the bitter hops however.  M - Medium body and carbonation but the bitter hops aftertaste stays with you for awhile after each sip.

Poured a nice golden color with a firm white head that lingered for a good long time.  Smell was citrus (pineapple, grapefruit) and pine.

I will definitely be buying more of these - very drinkable bomber and great to share.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,GinjaSlice,4.33,A: great golden orange color to it with some clarity. nice white head with good lacing that fades quick S: Was really hard to figure out what i was smelling but I decided it was kind of a grapefruit and piney smell. Very nice T: This is where this beer shines and is currently one of my favorites. Has a nice grapefruit bitter front with a kinda of sweet malty mid and a hoppy finish. My only slight complaint is the after taste is quite bitter M: Seems nice a light to me with just the right carbonation.  One of my favorite beers  Edit: just wanted to add as i'm finishing the beer there's almost a slight peppery flavor on the end,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Taste - Grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple and mango. Sort of a sweetness and heavy bitterness that almost peppery. Moves onto a more heavy pine, resin heavy earthy bitterness. The end is a mixture of a dry subtle bitterness like grapefruit zest blanketed by alcohol.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, medium carbonation, smooth, crisp and refreshing.  Overall - Good beer. Full flavored intense bitterness. Will be buying more at some point in the future.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and dry, with a very strong bitter hop finish.  The Verdict: I like it. It’s a hop bomb, and full of bitterness, but there’s enough flavors to keep my tongue happy. I prefer something less bitter, but this will do when I’m in the mood for something hoppy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Two fingers of slightly off white foam, settling to an eighth inch. Nice lacing on glass, low carbonation. Aroma: citrus hops with caramel maltiness in the background. Taste: hoppy obviously; citrusy, mostly grapefruit. Some sweet maltiness in the background. Mouthfeel: medium body, low carbonation, but enough to be satisfying. Overall: not a huge Stone fan as I find the bitterness fairly harsh in many of their beers, but Ruination has just enough malt character to offset some of the grapefruit pith bitterness.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

It dissipates over a few minutes, but leaves patches of bubbles scattered across the surface and wet heaps of lacing along the glass. The aroma is of citrus, stone fruits, and wet earth. Lots of earthen hops, pine resin, grass, and a bit of dank must. It tastes of bitter, earthy hops with a bit of spice. Loads of orange and grapefruit citrus up front with a hint of lemon towards the rear. All pine, grass, and bitter herbs in the middle. Mouthfeel is wet, lively and bitter.

147,4083,mfnmbvp,4.12,"12 oz. bottle, with enjoy by 04/20/2014 printed on the bottleneck. I'm somehow just now finally getting around to reviewing this beer from Stone. It's been over a year since I last had this offering, and that's way too long, so it's time to revisit it.  Poured into a clear balloon snifter.  A - Pours a beautiful bright golden orange colored body with some excellent clarity. One finger of sudsy white head that falls to half a finger rather quick. Scattered lacing. Looks very nice.  S - The nose is fruity, floral, and tropical. Grapefruit, pine resin, honey, breadiness, vague alcohol fumes, and some soapiness. Smells wonderful.  T - Taste, obviously enough, is mostly all hops. Grapefruit, mango, and pine resin. Dry, bready malt on the finish. Well enough for what it is, but the bitterness is probably a bit too much, and distracts from the other flavors of the beer.  M - Feel is dry, sticky, resinous, and bitter. Bready malt and hop resin on the palate. Medium-light bodied, good carbonation, and easy drinking at 8.20% abv.  Overall, a well-made, beautiful looking, aromatic, and intensely hopped beer. Although, I think I enjoy the regular Stone IPA more than I do it's big brother, this is a very nice DIPA, and I wouldn't mind enjoying it again.

T: Starts out with orange, mango, citrus peel and lemon, finishes malty.  M: Medium bodied, somewhat smooth for an IPA.  O: Better than your typical Stone beer, but that is according to my taste, and I generally don't like their hop preferences. This one has more orange, mango, pineapple and tropical fruit than others. Recommended if you like hoppy beers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,redresonatedragon,4.18,"Stone delivers a very complex and desirably quaffable IIPA. Both flavor and smell share a dank undertone that showcases a darker green, bitter hop profile blended with smooth carbonation and dry finish.An essential representation of a west coast IIPA",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,PeterParker,4.21,"Looks like a perfect IPA, in my opinion. Opaque and golden orange with a finger of head.  Smells like dry west coast IPA hops with a slight malt undertone. Really good so far.  Tastes ultra west coast IPA hoppy. Definitely can taste every one of the IBU's. Pine up front with grapefruit lingering for a while. Excellent.  Coats the mouth with the dryness. Good mouthfeel for an IPA.  Overall this is one of the better IPA's out there.

Perhaps a hint of lemon, but not much fruit to be found.  T - Explosion of pine and floral hops. As with the smell, not much in the way of citrus, but there is a hint of lemon and grapefruit. Bitter finish is not a surprise, but the bitterness, though strong, is not unpleasant. Minerality, but keeps just this side of medicinal - given the hop punch, avoiding aspirin notes in the close is an accomplishment.  M - Clean, crisp, with moderate carbonation, and drying on the end.  O - A fine example of the IPA that glories in the clean pines and floral notes of the hop over its citrus qualities. A brew that embraces the bitterness of the IPA. I found it a very satisfying drinking experience.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,FickleBeast,4.51,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this beer. I've had it at least a half dozen times and always love it.  12 oz bottle (yay!) poured into a nonic.  Pours a hazy copper color with two full fingers of sticky off white foam. Aroma is a full blown assault of citrus and piney hops.  First sip is a huge rush of piney hops. Certainly unbalanced but delicious for a hophead like myself. I remember the first time I tried this beer (10 years ago) and I was blown away by the hop flavor - I had never tasted a beer like this before. After all this time, it still holds up - the hops are flavorful, impactful, but not unpleasant. This is the basis by which I compare all other West Coast IPAs and honestly most don't measure up.  This beer is a must-try for any craft beer aficionado. Revolutionary at the time, and still delicious.  ""A liquid poem to glory of the hop"" indeed!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,thegodfather1076,4.44,"Presentation: Great looking bottle in the Stone gargoyle style with all label artwork and text painted on. Extremely eye-catching. Front states, “A liquid poem to the glory of the hop”, gives ABV info, and a bit of brewery info. Back gives a nice back story and description of the beer, the Stone definition of “Ruination”, IBU info. Web info on the side of the bottle. Gargoyle cap.  Appearance: An aggressive pour of the golden-yellow orange colored beer from its 22oz bottle into a 16oz snifter led to 2 finger khaki off white head of airy tightly packed head. Head retention was 4min 52sec before fading to a thick coating and ring. Excellent lacing.  Smell/Aroma: Smells of grapefruit citrus hops along with a bit of a sweet grassy aroma. Has a spiciness in the nose and malt aroma backbone.  Flavor/Taste: Tastes of sweet malts, sweet grapefruit citrus hops, and an earthy grassy taste on the front end that turns very resin bitter at midpoint with a grapefruit citrus finish and a resin bitter aftertaste. Great flavor profile.  MouthFeel/Drinkability: Medium bodied and crisp with the perfect amount of carbonation. Very very drinkable.  Overall/Comments: Another Great World Class beer from Stone that is very well balanced and superbly done. Lives up to every bit of hype that it receives.

147,4083,CASK1,4.79,"Can't believe I hadn't reviewed this before! One of my favorites.  Poured to a tulip from a bomber.  A - Perfect. Gorgeous gold with excellent clarity. Rich tan head that persists as a thin, soft layer leaving lacing to the bottom of the glass.  S - Very complex. Sweet honey malt up front quickly overpowered by dank hops. Plenty of pine, resin, and a hint of citrus present as well. Rather clean fermentation.  T - Similar to aroma. High hop bitterness, but balanced nicely by the sweet, toasty malt. Dank hop flavor somewhat overwhelms the other hops. Some pine and citrus, as well as a little cattiness add to the complexity.  M - Medium body, but high carbonation makes it seem a bit lighter. Very drinkable for a DIPA. Subtle alcohol warmth, but well-hidden. Dry, hoppy, slightly alcoholic finish that lasts and lasts.  O - Outstanding and one of my favorites. Only improvement (to me) would be a bit different hop character, upping the pine and citrus over the dankness.  Cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Getting a lot of pine too....just dank hop...some lemon like essence to it. As it warms you get some sweet malts that noticeably catch your nose. A real flowery, funky smell to it....not bad though by any means. Definitely gonna be a real powerful IPA. Moderate spotty lacing left around the glass.  A - Very nice solid orange color with a one finger frothy white head. Not see through and well carbed.  T/M - Definitely a Floral pine bomb. Not getting much citrus, and tropical fruit. Very floral. Very Bitter. a little bit of a booze tinge but not overwhelming at all. Very ""East Coast"". Floral Earthy hops linger on the palate well after the swallow.

You can't really go wrong with stone and this was a solid offering.

147,4083,Brew-Enthusiast1349,4.44,"As a budding enthusiast, my palate might not be as refined as a veteran connoisseur, so forgive me if my review seems sophomoric. I also realize such a statement compromises my credibility and enables bias, but I hope to appeal to those who are budding enthusiasts as well, and to establish a sense of comrade among the green-horns; to facilitate the transition from interest to passion. The Ruination IPA has been a beer I've been wanting to try for a while now, but decided to gain a certain degree of comparative reference in tasting other IPAs from various companies first. Today I decided to take the leap and dive into this long awaited hop-beast, and this is what I discovered:  Poured from a 22 ounce bottle into an Arrogant Bastard pint glass.  Appearance: A light amber color, with a golden hue. The head left a bit to be desired, as it was about a finger width, but that could have been fault of my own and not necessarily the IPA itself. Small bubbles effortlessly made their way to the top after I finished my pour, joining the head in concert of aesthetic appeal. I noticed the head retained its form for a while, and this pleased me. Although lacing might come into play later, chronologically speaking, it did not lace as well as I thought it would, but it did lace fairly consistently--again, the lack of desired lacing might be due to user error, as moisture may have been present in the glass prior to the pour.  Smell: Mostly citrus notes with floral undertones. As many have said in other reviews, notes of grapefruit are highly present, but not overpowering, The aroma was as well-balanced as the rest of the beer.  Taste: My first impression upon tasting this beer was that it was very well-balanced. The bottle reads 100+ IBUs, however I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it was not as bitter as I initially expected it to be. I very much enjoy bitter, but I would much rather drink a well-balanced beer than one that primarily features bitterness. The notes that were present in the aroma came through in the taste, as the citrus (primarily grapefruit) and floral notes (akin to pine) danced upon my taste-buds. Absence of alcohol in taste, as well as in smell, fit my criteria for a good beer.  Mouthfeel--A tad light and crisp, but without devaluing it's credibility as a big ale. The finish left a lingering bitterness, almost a dry, puckering, kind of taste--which I thoroughly enjoyed. And although the finish was bittering, it was practically refreshing at the same time.  Overall: It was what I anticipated it to be, I set the base for reference a while ago with the original Stone IPA, and in my opinion the Ruination IPA takes the proverbial cake. I will definitely buy this beer again, and perhaps the second time around I will notice something I didn't before; perhaps more accommodating glassware in terms of aroma will help flesh out more subtle nuances in flavor and aroma. However, someone who has never had an IPA, or drinks for only the buzz, will most likely walk away with a different perception of what Ruination means. To me, Ruination symbolizes a certain beauty and balance in chaos, whereas others might only absorb the connotations relating to destruction--of palate and mind. For those who enjoy IPAs regularly, but are starting to feel stagnant, this beer will definitely put you on your toes. Simply put: this beer is akin to a heavy metal song: to those from the outside looking in, it might seem like a bunch of noise, but to those willing to spend to the time to appreciate it discover the hidden melodies and complexities that make it a brilliant piece of art.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,shacawgo24,4.39,"A-Hazy yellow. Dull. Urine like. Held to light becomes murky light orange/golden like egg yolk. The head is egg-white white. Average size, two/three finger. Average retention. Average lacing. I like the fact an IPA doesn't always have to be bright & vibrant colored and still look good. Murky and mysterious. Demonic.  S-Citruses are all there. Orange, lemon and lime. Pine. Funky. What is this funk? It keeps you guessing. Funk is STRONG.  T-Lemon. Resinous middle and finish. Bitter citrus. Like an orange drizzled in grapefruit juice. Pine. A STRONG funky cheddar bitterness. Wow, one of the most bitter beers I've had. The backdrop is strong citrus/pine IPA, then this bitterness stands on the forefront. Malt is there if you want to dig and find it. This taste puts hair on your chest. Love how, a blockage of bitter pine funk clogs the palate, then a flood-wash of citrus breaks through the pine dam. Super pine.  M-Medium body. Not too chewy nor liquid thin. More on the fluid side than thick. Great carbonation, medium-high. Can be very bitter and yet, pleasing fruity sour tarts refresh on the finish. Sour yet bittersweet finish, like sucking on a lime. Feel meets the bar, doesn't wow. Does thin out a bit.  O-Worthy of praise. Expected a bit more. Will buy again. Not sure if four should be priced as a sixer. But this is a Super DIPA. I wish the bitter-to-citrus transition was more smooth. But it works with the ""one-two punch"" style. The cheddar funk makes me want to pair Ruination with a cheese plate. If you're not a craft drinker this will give you a sour face, (maybe even craft drinkers). This is not a gateway beer. I stress this because we may lose potential craft newbies if we beer advocates don't give them say a regular Stone IPA as liquid training wheels. Great beer for those who like bitter yet citrusy flavors combined with a ""can't put my finger, nose and tongue on this funk"" taste.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,TheMagnanimous,4.84,"Smell: Citrus fruit predominates, some piney/resiny dankness as well.  Taste: Sweetness from strong malt backbone up front with citrus fruit (tangerine, mango) from hops finishing with bitter lingering grapefruit notes. As hops coat the palate with each sip it becomes more difficult to detect the subtleties in the hop flavor profiles. Tremendous job by Stone of imparting massive hop flavor without being overly bitter.  Mouthfeel: Creamy medium/full bodied mouthfeel. Carbonation is medium/low in my opinion (maybe just the draught system) but this is key as too much carb in this beer would make the hop bitterness biting rather than smooth and creamy as it is.  Overall: Personally I like this a lot more than Stone IPA. It has surprisingly few rough edges for such a big beer, just a massive amount of delicious flavor and a malt profile that almost perfectly complements the avalanche of hops in the finish. Probably my favorite IPA/DIPA that is widely available.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Huge grapefruit flavors in the mouth; sweet fruit and pith bitterness. Pithy bitterness lasts into a sweet, marzipan flavor, ending on a very bittersweet note.

147,4083,Santosizer,4.04,"A - Poured into a tulip glass, and I must say extremely awesome. Nice 2 finger head, good retention, beautiful gold that just shines with hues of light.  S - Very subtle in every category. Light bodied malt coming through, bready, corn, wheat, hay, very grainy indeed with the notes. Mild on the citrus notes, very very subtle mixture of pine, citrus, definitely can catch the bitter in a nice breathe.  T - The nose does not due the brew justice for the onslaught your palate is about to experience. This has everything good about a DIPA, except one thing in my book. You get a subtle citrus, a big presence of malt, bread, definitely pine. You get your palate tainted with massive bitter, very one dimensional in this aspect and I know Stone did this on purpose. They definitely brought out this aspect of the hops.  M - Light to Medium body, not as full as some other DIPA. The abv is not present compared to other DIPA's out there. Nice carbonation, clean finish, dry, very inviting for another sip.  O - I think a person really owes this beer a fair chance, pour it into it's proper glassware. I had this straight from the bottle and I must admit, I found it very overwhelming. There was way too much too much happening at times, it felt as if someone was pouring cigarette buds on my tongue, then like I was walking through a tree lot, to you name it. However, when I poured this into a tulip glass, I got the full aromas, the head retention, and this beer definitely transformed like a Cinderella story. The only thing missing is that resin; that beautiful resin that us hopheads have come to know. This is the only thing missing to me. I wish Stone offered Ruinten year-round along with this. Ruinten, is the complete version of this, a great fusion of an Enjoy By with Ruination characteristics. This is a great start, get through this, and you are ready for the DIPA world.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,B75Avery,3.11,Not bad but tasted more like a Belgium or English style IPA to me. Left something desired for overall taste. To crisp to the tongue or over carbonated.

T: Follows the nose, lots of citrus as well as pineapple hop flavors as well as tons of malt to balance it all out.  M: Thick mouthfeel there is for sure some astringent feel left on the tongue and coating the teeth. I don't think it ruined my palette but it is a bitter beer.

Not much of a head but a nice copper color with good clarity. Citrusy hops, orange on the nose, resinous and hoppy with some distinct sweetness from the pale and carmel malts. Smells great! The taste is quite hoppy all around but very good. A generous amount of bitering hops on the start, this is cut by the sweetness of the malts as the sugars and alcohol coats the tongue mid palate and ends with another hoppy bite of bitterness. Not exactly a session beer but absolutely delicious especially if you like a nice hoppy brews. I certainly like my brews nice and hoppy so this is hitting the spot.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Poured from a 22 ounce bottle into my  presidential pint glass to a single finger head, nice lacing and a little darker than a lot of other  IPAs. Alcohol is big with this one at 8.2% but you’d never know it as you’re introduced to a  flavorful tye dye blending notes of mild grapefruit and juniper that wash down in a joyful  cascade of caramel. Nothing resinous about this beer as it’s completely fresh and pure. Stands  true to it’s name as a liquid poem to the glory of the hop. Insanely enjoyable, and memorable.  Brewed in California and a taste worthy of a hang gliding expedition through the pines of the  Seirra Nevadas with a landing through the Orange groves of Valencia (See Soarin’: Disney)  Highest recommendation, a hundred thumbs up, twenty-seven stars, an 11.5 out of 10.

147,4083,BreakfastStout,4.55,"Wow, this is one extremely drinkable Imperial IPA. I was going to sit down and go through my standard pour, smell, taste review process when I looked at my pint glass and realized it was 3/4 gone! Damn!! This is one of the easiest drinking IPA's if tried (and I've tried a lot!!). I live in Michigan so the gold standard for comparisons in IPA taste tests is the Two Heart. This one is right there with it, just no steelhead on the bottle. And Two Heart isn't an Imperial.  Pours a clear amber, not cloudy at all, with a decent 1/2 inch head with a fair amount of lacing. The lacing stays on the glass through out the 20 minute taste test. Solid!  Reeks of citrus hops of course, but without the bitter lingering mule kick that so many IPA's deliver.  Taste: This may be the tastiest drinking Imperial IPA's I've ever tried. I need to do a blind test vs. a Two Heart to see how they compare head to head. This beer is that good!  Mouth feel is surprisingly light for an IPA, again without the lingering bitterness that far too many IPS's deliver.  Overall this is an outstanding IPA. I with absolutely be coming back to this one. Fantastic!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,soju6,4.05,"Pours a clear copper color with a small head that fades to some lacing. The aroma is is a blend of citrus and pine, with a trace of of fruit in the background. Taste leans towards pine, with just a trace of sweetness. Has an ideal bitterness and a surprisingly dry finish. Medium body, crisp smooth and refreshing. Great balance with no hint of the 7.7% ABV. This beer sets a good standard to compare other DIPAs to. Well worth checking out.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,heygeebee,3.7,"From Warners. BB 25/11/13. Oops.  A - hazy amber - lighter than usual. Three finger head, spotty lace.  S - muted grapefruit, floral hops, solid malt.  T - a bit muddled really. Hops have died and malt is doughy. Ah well, still quite good drinking but bitterness is astringent and unbalanced. Only notable element is grapefruit/pine, more like an AIPA not a double.  M - medium carbonation, slick to being almost oily. Hides ABV nicely.  O - good drinking but am left wishing I had bought earlier.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Wobbly,3.85,"For what it is trying to do, this is a very good beer. But my problem with this and so many Double IPA's is the very American sensibility of excess. Just because a beer has a lot of hops, does not mean it is great.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jedijezus,3.31,"This IPA wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Appearance was great. Orange and clear with 2 fingers of frothy head. Overall taste and smell seems rotten in every sense. It tastes like rotten tomatoes except hoppy as all hell. Not watery yet surprisingly smooth. It might have been just a bad batch, but this is my review.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ajmitch4,4.31,"Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a Spiegelau tulip glass.  Appearance: Clear golden in color. Head dissipates slowly and leaves a heavy lace.  Smell: A hop-lovers dream. Citrus and piney notes  Taste: The hops hit hard and long, but are balanced out by the malt. Each sip leaves behind that back-of-the-mouth bitterness that begs for another drink. The alcohol doesn't overpower either which is sometimes hard for me with imperial IPAs.  Mouthfeel: Keep coming back to it, but extremely well balanced.  Overall: Stone makes some fantastic IPAs. Not sure why it took me so long to try this one, but I'm a fan. Think I prefer their Enjoy By and definitely their RuinTen more, but this one is certainly a home run as well.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Not to be outdone, it hits you with bready, toasted malts with some fruitienss.  Mouthfeel: Medium body, good carbonation  Overall: Excellent beer, though it doesn't seem as extreme at it once did.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,zookerman182,3.77,"Appearance is a golden orange color with a two finger head, very clear. Aroma is peppery and piney and malty. Taste is slightly malty but mostly pine and peppery with just a little bit of grapefruit. There's a nice balanced mild bitterness throughout that I enjoy but this beer to me tastes a tad malty. Mouthfeel is ok. Not my favorite offering from stone.  This beer was supposed to be drank by 3 days ago, take this not consideration if you are reading this review.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,tmm313,4.74,"A- Semi hazy, light amber body, with creamy 2 finger head. Incredible retention, lacing, and trailing.  S- Big pine up front with tangerine, grapefruit, orange, peppery spices, malts, subtle floral, and dank.  T- Changed fairly dramatically as it warmed. Straight out of the tap, the pine and bitter hops were huge up front with just a slight wave of citrus and malt on the back end. As it warmed, the pine would hit first, but would almost immediately be met with stronger grapefruit, malts, and citrus sweetness. One of the most complex and balanced IPAs I've ever had.  M- Creamy, oily, and slightly heavy. Great carbonation. Nice bitter aftertaste.  O- I loved this beer. The Stone people have it figured out. In your face hops with flavors moving around and mixing the way they're supposed to. It was one of those you were sad to take the last drink of. I will be having this many more times to come.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Stevedore,4.1,"12oz bottle, enjoy by 1/6/2014, poured into an unlabeled snifter today, 10/16/2013. First time I've had this, surprisingly. Glad I finally got around to picking up a single of this and ticking it off.  Pours a fairly standard Stone IPA appearance- golden amber body with a fairly fluffy white head with good retention. Lacing sticks on the glass as it goes down. Nothing über special but nothing to fault here.  Smells fairly sweet actually. Biscuity and caramel presence is predominant here. Some sharply floral aromas, a bit of grapefruit but not a ton of it. Actually quite balanced.  Flavour profile is nice and hoppy. Lots of floral notes accompanied by a bit of grapefruit, accentuated most by a decent bit of sharp, to the point, pine. It's quite bitter as you can imagine. The malt backbone isn't shy here either. Biscuits, honey, caramel round things out and cuts through the hoppiness a bit. But make no mistake, it is quite bitter.  Medium bodied, well carbonated, creamy and goes down well. Quite a bitter aftertaste that lingers quite a while, a bit more than I'd like but why should I be surprised when it comes to a beer named Ruination?  Very solid DIPA, nowhere near the best that I've had, but given that this is a shelf beer and is usually found fresh when its on the shelf, it's really not a bad purchase at all. Focused on the bitterness and the explosiveness of the hops, it's the strong malt backbone that balances the entire beer out that is a pleasant surprise.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,PaulyB83,4.19,"Enjoy by Mar. 20 poured into a Sam Adams glass.  L- Deep gold, light copper, two finger white head, great clarity.  S- Lots of Centennial notes of floral, orange. The Chinook and Magnum add some dank pine and kind of give it a sulfur aroma that reminds me a bit of sauerkraut.  T- Citursy, floral, dank pink, good level of bitterness for a DIPA. I actually prefer the taste more than the aroma.  F- Medium nice drinkability for an imperial ipa.  O- A very nice, easy to find, year round DIPA. I do prefer some of Stone's other DIPAs though, RuinTen and Enjoy By.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,not2complex,4.5,This beer is very enjoyable very hoppy can be a bit to much for other very Strong has a good hang seriously the taste stays in your mouth quite a bit but can be addicting to drink after the first sip its not a beer I would recommend for someone trying an IPA for the first time but over all to its a great beer to have especially with some food,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The mouth feel is nirvana and my taste-buds sing with thanks to this excellent entry. Well done and Bravo Stone Brewing!!

It was AWESOME as well!!! sMc Carry on Citizens",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,SteadySippin,3.52,"Served from a bottle to a chilled glass.  A - Light copper/gold with off white head. Pretty clear looking in the glass, not too foggy.  S - This beer smells strange. Not bad, but strange. It smells a lot like bread or yeast, with some fruit in there. I don't personally mind it but I can think of other IPA's that smell better.  T - Wow. This beer tastes very unique. It is sweet upon entering my mouth, and by the time i've swallowed it I can really taste the bitterness from the hops. There is some fruit notes in there too, possibly grapefruit? The bitterness lingers for quite some time after a nice gulp, then slowly fades away until you take another sip. Really nice tasting beer.  M - Feels kind of light in the mouth, thicker upon swallowing. Covers the whole pallet equally.  O - Definitely not a bad beer by any means. I probably wouldn't drink more than two in a row, but I would definitely buy a few more singles from total wine in the future. Overall it is a great beer, but sort of different from other good IPA's I have tried. Would recommend if you like hoppy beers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

This may be the double-dry hopped version... T- Starts off with some intense pine bitterness, follows with a woodsy finish. The finish lingers for a long while. M- The malt produced a nice color and bready flavor, which is masked by the hops in the flavor and smell. O- This beer lacks the resin note many Double IPAs can have. I felt the balance was perfectly done in alignment with the style, it almost had a pilsner body with a nice bitterness level, and the nose was also not to be forgotten; it had everything.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,arescan,4.75,"A - Very mild color with a bit of haze and a nice head. The bottle is a real work of art.  S - Very earthy aroma.  T - Very rich and flavorful. Lots of competing flavors that don't overpower you. The hoppiness is very strong, but it's complimented by some earthier flavors that really accentuate it.  M - Goes down very smooth with little bite. Makes that next sip very easy to take.  Overall - I'd recommend it to anyone who's looking for an enjoyable IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,WadeBridgman,4.45,"Appearance: Pours a very pretty pale orange color with a little haze to it. A nice looking brew for sure. The bottle is really creative, Stone does a great job with their image.  Smell: The smell is fantastic, so many aromas are colliding with this beer it's amazing; definitely a solid intro.  Taste: A great bitter taste with 100 IBU's, this brew comes on strong as a sweet and fruity flavor then ends with complete hoppyness and a pleasant bitter flavor that hangs and leaves you craving more. One of my favorites to date, very enjoyable very powerful.  Mouth feel: The feel is great in total honesty, a smooth beer that has a nice carbonation. A solid bitter taste is left in your mouth that creates a unique trait for this beer.  Overall: Stone has done some good work on this brew and I am impressed. Ruination is a strong hoppy bitter beer that is quite pleasant and just fun to drink. Definitely suited for people who enjoy bitter tastes (much as I am). This is a beer I would drink regularly and recommend to all the beer fanatics out there.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

It could be your gateway to the wonderful world of hops up on hops.  Stone has sort of made themselves famous for their use of hops and it truly shows. The smell is not offensive, rather a bit sweet and enticing. The carbonation is just right. The flavor is very balanced.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,GrizzleFist,4.26,"Bought in a 22oz bottle  Appearance: The bottle itself is amazing, love the picture, love the paragraph long description of the beer and what to expect from it. The beer also looks great, light in color, good amount of carbonation.  Smell: So many it was hard to really pick anything out. Hops, Pine, Citrus, several spices and fruity aromas.  Taste: Very bitter, but in an extremely tolerable way. It didn't make me gag or wish I didn't buy a 22oz bottle of it. No one flavor really stuck out, pretty much an accumulation of everything I mentioned in smell and then some.  Mouthfeel: Had a normal carbonation, my whole mouth and tongue tasted nothing but the beer and no part of my tongue tasted the beer any stronger than the others.  Overall: An outstanding beer. Not sure what they initially were planning when they were making this beer, but I'm sure after they tasted it and realized the whole mouth and tongue tasted it almost equally and it completely ""ruined"" their taste palette; that they decided they couldn't call it anything else but Ruination.  Will definately buy again in the near future",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Cramletram,3.91,"I started out great on this one. It is very strong, and I was in the mood for something strong. The attack of bitter hops is undeniable. If you're in the mood to get punched in the kisser by a beer repeatedly, this is the one for you. But a guy can only take so many lickin's. Eventually the hops power of Ruination got me.  I used to think too much hops wasn't possible. I now stand corrected - for my taste. I love how strong and aggressive this beer is. That alone makes fun to drink. But it's a tad too piney for me to enjoy an entire bomber. Maybe I'll get there some day, but I had trouble finishing this one.  Of course, I did finish it. Duh.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Poured an excellent slightly hazy golden color with a little under 2 fingers frothy white head. Ok carbonation, decent lacing.  Hops on the nose, some floral tones trying to fight through.  Taste was heavy on the biting hops all over the tongue. Nice citrus flavors too.  Mouth was a little under medium, finish was strong, and left a long lasting impression .

M - Very nice and crisp, the way and IPA should be.  O - A decent IPA. I know I do not like it as much as others as it just simply doesn't fit my taste for what I look for in an IPA (I prefer less lingering, dull bitterness and more bright citrus). With that said, I can see why others like it so much. Clearly it is well crafted.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Vincent_bros,4.83,"What can I say.  Instant classic, shoulders of giants... nahh. This one stands alone. In my opinion Stone's best offering, it's what a double IPA should be.  Grapefruit describes only one part of this beer. Not overly sweet, it has a bitterness that builds slowly like a crescendo and fades slowly. The sweetness is balanced it a prefect sacrifice to bring the taste to climax.  Mouthfeel is decently light without any give, it's not soda but it's not hot chocolate either.  Go get a bottle, you won't be disappointed.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The aroma was all citrus and pine. This was not the freshest bottle, so I am sure the smell was somewhat dulled compared to its peak. The taste followed the nose. It was citrus and pine with a sweetness that followed with a bitterness. It had a medium body with a good amount of carbonation.  Overall, I am impressed with this beer. I am admittedly not the most refined IPA person, but I can appreciate a good one when I taste one.

I smell a strong presence of Columbus hops, possibly even a little centennial but definitely very very columbus hop forward.  Taste: Super citrusy super bitter yet surprisingly smooth...the sheer floral explosion in your mouth almost cuts the bitter down to size. I taste a slightly detectable sweetness from a mellow 2 row malt combined with victory malts or something of the sort, but nothing distracting you from this hop masterpiece. I love this beer.

Delicious citrusy aroma with notes of grapefruit, pine, resin, tangerines and bready malt. Very tropical, you can even get some mango and pineapples here. Such smell won’t fade away nor mutate during the degustation. I could smell this all night. Flavor of grapefruit, oranges, pine, slightly roasted and biscuit malts, passion fruit seeds and tangerines. It starts on the tropical side and its bitterness starts climbing exponentially, smooth operator, smoooth operator. Dry aftertaste with a long lasting bitterness that won’t go away. Its 100+ IBUs made me sneeze right away (and again, and again), but it is still superbly balanced and not aggressive as one would normally expect. Medium to full body with low carbonation. Not really sticky as some of her peers. 7.7% abv is completely timid against its hop power and intense flavor. That is a top notch DIPA, not as tiresome as those that try to over compensate bitterness with excessive malt sweetness. Closest to perfection and hard to get any better.

147,4083,StoutHunter,3.79,"I picked up a bottle of Stone's Ruination IPA a couple weeks ago for $3.55 at Boyne Country Provisions. I've been meaning to try this beer for a while but I always forget to pick a bottle up and for some reason it caught my eye so I thought I better grab a bottle so I can give this beer a try, so lets see how it goes. Bottled on date was rubbed off so I cant tell how fresh it was. Poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a snifter.  A- The label looks nice, it highlights the Stone gargoyle and it's got the typical Stone rant also. It poured a nice and slightly hazy looking gold color that took on an amber/orange color when held to the light with two and half fingers worth of fluffy white head that died down to a thin ring that stayed till the end and left some nice sticky lacing behind. This is a pretty good looking beer, I have no complaints.  S- The aroma starts off with a slightly higher amount of medium sweetness followed by a loads of hops that seem to impart an even mixture of piney and citrus hops with a good amount of onion and garlic like hop aromas. Up next I get a lighter amount of malts that have a biscuit malt like aroma. I thought the aroma was pretty nice, but I would have liked it a little less of the onion and garlic hop profile.  T- The taste seems to be fairly similar to the aroma and it starts off with a medium amount of sweetness followed by a by a good amount of hops that still retain that pretty much even mixture of citrus, piney, and onion like hops with some resiny hops showing up in the background. Up next comes the malts that seem to show up slightly more than they did in the aroma and they impart some lightly toasted and biscuit malt flavors along with a noticeable alcohol flavor. On the finish there's a lower amount of high bitterness with a very piney and citrus hop like aftertaste with the bitterness not lingering too long. This was a pretty nice tasting beer, but I wish the fruity hops shined through a little more.  M- Fairly smooth, a little oily, a little crisp, on the thicker side of being medium bodied with a medium amount of carbonation, the mouthfeel was pretty good and it worked well with this beer.  Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and an above average example to the style, the hops were highlighted just like they should be and the hop profile was nice, but it didn't come together as great as some of the better beers of the style. This beer had ok drinkability, it was fairly smooth and the flavors did a decent job at holding my attention, I could drink two of these but I'm not sure that taste would make me want to have another one in a row. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, I thought they were both pretty good and they worked well with this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the onion and garlic like hop profile, I don't mind a little bit of it in my DIPA's but it seems just a little too heavy handed in this beer. I would buy this beer again, and I will be on the look out for a fresh bottle to compare this to and so I can update this review. I would recommend this to any DIPA fan. All in all I liked this beer, but I wasn't crazy about it, it had most of the aspects that I look for in the style, but it was still just a little rough around the edges and I think that prevented it from being as good as it could. Stone is one solid brewery and this beer is a good example of that, keep being yourself Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,SquidHead,4.24,"After being convinced that this is the perfect pregame for free beer Wednesday at the local bar, I quickly poured some into a mason jar and admired the golden color similar to the great prairies of the Midwest. Laced thickly, and leaving trails worse than snails, the Ruination leaves a thick scent hovering around the nostrils. Strong alcohol taste. Definitely some wheat or a lit of barley thrown in there. Some citrus, orange like. A slight taste/smell of the pine barrens known throughout New (Dirty) Jersey. No cotton mouth at the end which is always good.

With a standard pour, I yielded a very decent 1-1/2 fingers of head, which was just orange of white and a diluted amber color. The head quickly gave until it was about 1/2 a finger thick and left slight lacing, but nothing to write home about. The head stayed until the end, it should be said. Flavor follows the nose, and just as I thought it would, Ruination proceeds to wreck the palate at first sip. It's very bright, and makes it hard to pick out the flavors and components once you've begun. Some would say it grabs your attention, I prefer to say it kills any possibility of enjoying other beers after this one (at least in the same evening).

147,4083,Somebody_Else,4.66,"I love. This. Beer.  This beer has everything I want in a hop bomb. It opens with a wonderful piney, citrusy nose and rolls right into a bitter hop tromp across my tongue. I get a little pineapple in the flavor; that's one of my favorite hops notes. I think the malt character is very well matched to the hops here -- you can definitely identify a nice toasty sweetness, but it doesn't try to steal the hops' show.  I like how it has less ABV then many of my other favorites. At 7.70 ABV it is less overwhelming but tastes as big and strong the other bombs.  I am very pleased that this is widely available, year 'round.  I've talked with friends who have been underwhelmed by this beer -- and these folks are hop heads -- so I can only assume they got an old bottle; it's one of those ""drink fresh"" beers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,dwren89,4.5,"Appearance: golden with an orangey hue, thin white fizzy head, good clarity  Aroma: piney, with citrus and definite biscuity malt character  Taste: nicely balanced for an IPA with significant biscuit and light toast character that then gets washed away by strong pine and slight citrus hop flavor and bracing bitterness.  Mouthfeel: crisp, bracing, and refreshing. A medium-high carbonation.  Overall: A great IPA that is nicely balanced, exhibiting great biscuit malt character that then succumbs to the piney and citrus hop flavor and gripping bitterness as any good IPA should. A great addition to any IPA oriented pick six.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Who drinks a beer for appearance anyway?  S - Citrus, pine, some spice. Basically Stone IPA and a half.  T - HOPS! I'm serious, aside from Hoptimum by Sierra Nevada, this is the only beer I would say that about. Some would consider it grassy, but those citrusy, piney, spicey hops cut through like nothing else. The malt is light, but not too light, and while I usually like a light malt profile, with all those hops it probably wouldn't hurt if it was a little heavier.  M - HOPS! They don't call it Ruination for nothing. While it's very dry, the hops seem to even it out.  O - Stone is the standard by which I measure all IPAs, and Ruination is Stone on steroids. In fact, I'm drinking one right now.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,ISmith87,4.85,"Stone Ruination! I've had this many times but wanted to try it again after trying RuinTen a little while ago. So I'll try this and review it right now and then go back and compare to by review of RuinTen to see what differences there are between this and the amped up version.  A - 4.75 - Beer is a crystal clear amber/orange/copper color with 2 fingers of off white head, which dissipates down to a nice thick film on top of the beer that is already lacing without taking a sip of it yet.  S - 4.75 - A lot of citrus smell from the hops, with grapefruit, orange, lemon lime, pear. A little bit of pine in there too. Smells smooth.  T - 5.0 - Citrusy hops and caramel malt flavors predominate and are perfectly balanced. Definitely a lot of orange, lemon-lime, and pine hints from the hops Less grapefruity than other beers like it but it's still there. Some breadiness in there too. Great beer.  M - 4.75 - Medium carbonation. Awesome citrusy aftertaste. Alcohol mostly hidden at 7.7%  O - 4.75 - Great beer, available pretty much everywhere and therefore a great beer to pair with golfing, boating, home-brewing, etc. Good value for the $9.99 a 4 pack that it is (or $6.50 a bomber). Not as good of a value as Hop Stoopid but hey who's counting. Awesome.  Compare to RuinTen - Appearance looks like it was pretty much the same. Smell must have been pretty much the same too (Ruination does have a hint of garlic, maybe not as much since I didn't notice it until smelling it again). Taste also is the same, just a little stronger overall with RuinTen. Mouthfeel - RuinTen was definitely stronger in hoppiness and alcohol content. Overall - I'd say considering ABV the beers are almost exactly equal. If you're looking for a little more bang for your buck in ABV then grab the RuinTen if it's available. Taste is very similar - RuinTen is just the amped up version.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

If I were a PE fund, I would buy them and scale them up without ruining them, which brings us to the subject of...  RUINATION.... It's the best DIPA I have tried. Most are so alcoholic that they pale compared with their little 6% brothers. in this case, I like Ruination equally to Stone IPA and Arrogant Bastard. Wow!  A: Poured from 22oz into .5l cylinder. Beautiful 3 finger head, that leaves behind rings of sticky lacing, and returns with a swirl. Almost clear, lighter than expected pale honey amber color. Nice.  S: Heavenly, original, floral, fruity, and piney hops. The nose is big, you can just sniff this over and over. It's perfection. It's ruined me. Big nose beer 5.0.  T: As with the aroma the flavor is massive hops, a California wave, but smooth. Hoppy through out with a cracker malt background. Good bread, communion wafer. Flavors of grapefruit, lemon, orange jam, and pine scents floating on out of the oven italian bread like grandma made.  Not bitter, despite the big, big hops.  F: Is full, rich, drying, and silky smooth and creamy weight. Warming, but the alcohol doesnt mask or take anything away as it does in most DIPAs.  Ruination is stronger, more hoppy, flowery, and distinct that their IPA so it just depends on your mood and food which to go with.

T: Rather bitter but it was expected. Citrus fruits come through as dominant and the beer is very ""west coast"" in profile highlighting various. Sweet malts come through a bit more as the beer warms and add a nice complexity even though the beer is definitely more balanced in favor of the hops.  M: Carbonation is great as is mouth feel.

T: Citrus, pineapple and ends with a grassy note and solid malt backbone. Definitely crystal malts. Exactly what I expect from a solid west coast ADIPA.  M: Smooth, medium bodied with a very satisfying bitter ending,  O: Very good ADIPA. Stone never disappoints. Delicious, but I think the RuinTen is a bit better.

147,4083,SleepyEast,3.83,"Quick review on this hoppy beast. No real comments on color or anything at the moment. Again a quick review. Quick FYI I am pretty new to craft beer but I enjoy the hoppy stuff.  No bottle date and the expiration date rubbed off on me (UGHhhhh). Pretty sure it was listed as expiring in October though.  As soon as I cracked this bottle open a HUGE PUNGENT smell of hops smacked me right in the face. Upon first sniff I noticed something odd. Had to take a second smell. Yup. To me this beer REEKS of weed (not that I know what that smells like). Not sure if that's because the hop plant is related to cannabis (I think) or if my bottle is skunked. Will have to buy a second bottle.  Ignoring the cannabis smell, I get very strong floral notes with sweetness following behind (related to the cannabis smell).  First sip gives bitterness at the tip of the mouth followed by smooth sweetness and a strong spiciness. Slightly bitter at the end. Kind of disappointing since I was expecting something way more bitter than I actually got. The alcohol also hides itself very well.  Overall I guess I was expecting something very different. It was very floral bit not bitter enough for what I paid and was expecting. The smell is defiantly something I want to explore more. Not close to my any of my favorite IPAs but its very drinkable. I like it but at close to $5 a bottle, if rather have a 90 min IPA and keep the change. I will give this another shot though.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

N: Plenty of hops in this one, but there’s also plenty of malt. Lots of pineapple and mango. Some pine. Some apricot and tangerine.  T: A lot sweeter than I expected, but there’s still plenty of hops to be found in here. Really well balanced and drinkable, but it’s no longer as assertively aggressive as it used to be on the DIPA landscape. It’s also rather muddled as though it wants to be part of both worlds of West and East coast.  M: Resinous with lots of alcohol given how light it is relatively speaking.  O: It seems like it would be very easy to pick Stone IPAs out a lineup given how their yeast is one of a kind.

M: Medium body and medium carbonation that feels very pretty clean for a DIPA.  O: My understanding was that this beer was supposed to be undrinkable because it was so bitter. Not the case at all.

147,4083,BeerDocT,4.3,"Ah, Stone Brewing. Hop-obsessed and proud of it. I've never been disappointed in a Stone beer and am finally getting around to reviewing this beer, one of their most famous brands. ""Tent-pole,"" as it were. Here goes... .  Appearance: 3.75: Nice head of around 1/4"". Appearance is a pleasant, bright golden color. Beer is hazy and opaque with some particulate matter floating around.  Smell 4.25: Wonderful bouquet on this beer. Hop forward and big. I detect Chinook, Columbus...something else in here, too. Almost an earthy, cumin scent.  Taste 4.50: Big. Beer. Front is somewhat sweet, with a huge and deep hop kick. This is all middle of the palate. Speaking of the middle, it is velvety smooth and quickly fades into a slightly salty finish that plays up more of the delicious hops. Big and bold hop tastes come forward at this level: grapefruit rind, candied citrus, pine...fabulous. Aftertaste is wonderful and hits you over the head with more alkaline hoppiness and almost perfumy. Just fabulous.  Mouthfeel 4.0: Creamy and smooth mouthfeel and just right carbonation.  Overall 4.25: Just fantastic. Very smooth, but big and bold, this beer is a symphony to hops. It is maybe a bit too much for sessioning...at least for the timid out there. However, it is a fabulous beer to sit and sip, so yeah...it could turn into a session before you know it. It certainly did with me. Ruination is another great beer from what is quickly becoming my favorite brewery. Go buy this beer. NOW!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Smell is a nice blend of piney hops and juicy citrus flavors. Some alcohol peeks though the hops, and only a small hint of malt makes the journey. Taste is spicy bitter piney hops right off the bat, smoothing into some softer citrus flavors and crackery malt with some leftover hop resin flavors blend with the well-hidden alcohol. I still consider myself a hophead, but lately I've moved away from beers like this. Overall though, it's an amazing beer regardless; right on the line between a crazy IPA and a tamer DIPA. Great hop character, I just wish it was a bit more balanced. But it never claimed it was balanced, so it achieves what it sets out to do.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,JG-90,4.37,"Beer is a clear orange/peachy color with a small-medium sized white head with okay retention. Leaves a small to moderate amount of lacing. Aroma has a great juicy citrus character consisting of pinneapple, grapefruit, and lemon, maybe a hint of tangerine. Also has a noticable resinous smell as well as a bit of bread.  Taste starts with a ton of bitter grapefruit and pineapple, then moves on to pine and resin, finishing with grapefruit, lemon, and resin. Very very bitter, especially for a 7.70% beer. Has a bitter grapefruit/resin and slighty bready aftertaste. Has a lighter than average mouthfeel with high carbonation for an IPA/DIPA.  Really is a great beer, packs a ton of punch at 7.70 %, kind of on the edge between a great DIPA and a rediculous IPA.

Earthy and piney bitterness, with a slight note of peach down deep. M: Hops pulls on the tongue after an initial note of alcohol, melding into a dryness that lingers on tongue.

147,4083,ChefDavidH,4.62,"I poured this from the bottle into a chilled pilsner. With a standard pour, I yielded a very decent 1-1/2 fingers of head, which was just orange of white and a diluted amber color. The head quickly gave until it was about 1/2 a finger thick and left slight lacing, but nothing to write home about. The head stayed until the end, it should be said. The smell of this DIPA is citric and hoppy and very happy, if that makes any sense. When I smelled it, I couldn't wait to taste it. The taste, at first, is citric, then piney, then the hops take over but before they can rule all the malt comes in and balances the whole thing out beautifully. If it's not the best IPA out there it could be considered the best balanced for sure. Mouthfeel is dry but not terribly so, there is the lingering of the malt and hops with resin and some carbonation breaking through. Overall it is a very satisfactory DIPA. It should be considered a safe 'go to' IPA for nights when you want something solid and balanced but aren't feeling too adventurous. I would buy it again for sure. In fact, I plan to have one tomorrow night as well. Cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I wouldn't expect anything less from these guys. Pine, resin, grassy, earthy, and citrus hops. Caramel and bready malts in there with some dried orange too.  Taste: As for the 100 IBU's, I love it because of the malt balance with the hops even though the hops are front stage. Taste brings out tropical flavors along with everything else mentioned above.

147,4083,ThisWangsChung,4.1,"Re-review. 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  A: Pours a gorgeous copper color with excellent clarity. A two finger head with a white shade is formed; starting off uniformly even, but becoming fairly rocky as it fades. Some lacing is left on the glass, though not quite as much as the best IPAs of the style.  S: It's actually not a sledgehammer of hops - I notice a moderate amount of maltiness to it, which is biscuity in nature. Still, the hoppiness is the real star of the show here, loaded with floral, piny, and even fruity mango notes. Definitely a great aroma, even after all these years.  T: The first sip doesn't seem to reveal a ton of hoppiness...but the second sip is where the resiny note take charge. While the opening is actually decently malty (featuring notes of toffee, earth, and marzipan), the finish accumulates plenty of piny, floral hop flavors. Combined with the earthen tones, it almost seems to give it a faint boozy flavor to it, but there's definitely no booze in the feel. The hops are actually defined in their flavors - while it's moderately bitter, it's not palate-wrecking for the sake of being palate-wrecking. My only real complaint is subjective: I want less pine and more tropical fruits in the flavor profile. Ah well, not this beer's fault.  M: It's not the lightest-feeling DIPA by any stretch (even at a not-so-double-these-days 7.7%), but it does have a good crispness to the back end. Hop oils accumulate on the palate, slowly building a dry bitterness as more is sipped. It definitely has the ""gotta have another sip"" quality all the good IPAs have.  O: Eighteen months ago, this kicked my ass, and made me come back for more. Nowadays, my palate isn't raped, but that just means I can enjoy all the hoppy goodness that much more. Even if some of Stone's one-offs (I'm also looking at you, Stone IRS) are wildly inconsistent, their mainline of brews are usually rock-solid. This being no exception. Actually, I'd call Ruination the best of their regulars.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Direx,4.37,"A: Orange Cremesicle color, nice head--stays for a very long time (no signs of it going anywhere after 5 minutes untouched).  S: Very pleasant harvest wheat smell with a generous serving of hops. Minor citrus and beeswax scent, citrus is perhaps grapefruit.  T: First taste: Pleasant, really goes down smoothly. Hoppy but, light for an IPA. Still detecting subtle citrus tones. Second taste: getting hoppier--it's clearly starting to pick up some power. Smooth, clean finish but still aggressive like an IPA should be. Third taste and onwards: Damn this is a fine IPA, well balanced and really a pleasure to savor. Real finesse for an IPA, not as much brute force that i'm used too (but still very strong, hoppy character). Citrus taste is no longer detectable. Generous serving of hops, no getting around that.  M: Sour foam, but hey it's an IPA what do you expect. Earthy, full, not watered down.  O: Just a really pleasant IPA, something different. Doesn't have the same intensity of many great IPAs, but it is balanced and one of the most refined IPAs I've ever had.

147,4083,Alivewiththegloryofhops,4.23,"After reading a bit on the BA forum, I have been curious to try the Stone products, and this is the first one. Thankfully, I was able to find a ""make-your-own 6-pack"" today, so I had to take the opportunity. Pouring this beautiful IPA into my pint glass, I was immediately punched in the face with a glorious aroma of hops. I have been partial to the clear amber colors, so this beer absolutely fit the bill. Head formation was surprisingly easy, I overdid it a bit to the point of 2"" and over the edge of the glass, but it still looked great. Head retention was good too. With the bottle saying that is had 100+ IBU's, I had outrageous bitterness expectations, but besides a lingering bitterness taste for about 10 minutes, my expectations were only partially fulfilled. The feel was very smooth with a good balance of carbonation. I definitely appreciated the hoppiness in the retro-olfaction. Taste was great, though not as good as the Harpoon IPA, I was wondering if it was affected in being shipped from California to New Hampshire, plus I don't know how long it was sitting in the cooler under that fluorescent lighting, so I don't want to be too critical.

It poured nice, ending with a 2 finger, slightly off white head that filled the pint glass to the top.  Taking a deep inhale of the beer, hops were prominent. I was immediately reminded of when I homebrew - the smell of the concentrated hop is unmistakable. I was looking forward to this.  The taste backed up the smell - right up front hop. As one would expect, it is bitter, but the malt bill balanced out nicely against it, especially for a 100+ IBU beer. A slight aftertaste is all that kept me from ranking it a full 5 in taste. Don't take that wrong, though. This is one of the best IPAs I've had, and it was well worth the hefty price of admission (case was almost $70 with tax).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Pineapple and mango, sweet breads, touch of alcohol.  Not as flavorful as the nose implies it's gonna be but definitely a smooth beer. Pungent hop resin bitterness up front. Tropical fruit flavors but no sweetness. Bitter throughout but not overly so. Malt flavor detected but again, adds no sweetness, just seems to mild down the bitterness. Some burnt toast crusts with raw hoppy leaf flavor and tropical fruit. Bit of detectable alcohol. A really nice drinking beer for those that do truly love the flavor and bitterness of hops.

147,4083,Kuaff,4.46,"I shoulda reviewed this one a long time ago. Back when I first had it, it was my first IPA of ANY kind, and WHAT an introduction it was. It made a memorable impression on me then, and it still does now. Poured from a bomber into a snifter at cellar temperature.  Ruination is a remarkably clear golden orange with a rocky, two-finger white head.  It smells like a fragrant pine forest in which the grass has been freshly trimmed and an occasional misfit tree bearing tropical fruit also grows.  The taste is full of piney hops. This is easily the most pine-forward beer I've ever had. The bitterness is intense, resinous, and lingers long in a dry, clean finish which makes me feel like my palate has been purged after each sip. The finish also has a sublte, biscuity, bready aftertaste which is only noticeable once the storm of bitter hoppiness subsides.  I'm not all that good at describing mouthfeel, so I""ll just say... it's good.  Ruination lives up to its name; it is indeed ruinous... in a nice way. And the name is so much fun to say as well... Ruination... Ruuuination... Roo-i-na-shun... heheh.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Ry_Swell_Guy,4.23,"What a great beer! Supper hoppy, smells greats, stone has the best art on their bombers as well, I always save them! I love hoppy bitter beers, but even this can be a bit much some times for my pallet, it's a once a month kind of beer for sure, but I always enjoy splitting a bottle with my Dad.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,yeastlovehoppiness_jess,4.96,"Before my dark descent into my beloved porters, stouts, and doppelbocks – I gave IPAs a try. I met a red IPA I fancied here and there, but was put off by the hoppy bitterness of what I now call the ""good stuff."" I gave IPAs a second chance and here I am: infatuated. This Ruination IPA is the good stuff.  A: Caramel gold in color topped with a bit of creamy beige head.  S: Fragrance is of citrus hoppiness.  T: And the taste! Pungent, hoppy, bitter. It's got bite. And yet it's balanced, too.  M: Medium bodied and a little fizzy/zingy.  O: Loved the hoppiness, the flavors, the bite. Can't wait to drink this again!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jroberts8811,4.75,"A-Pours honey-amber; transparent. crystal-clear. Head is 1 finger off-white, moderate bubbles that form a soft head. Dissipates quickly with great retention. Tis a thing of beauty in a Tremens tulip.  S-Sweet Hops, Malt, citrus - grapefruit, lemon, apricot.  T- soft, sweet apricot, not overtly hoppy, Bitter but not as much as I anticipated - not mouth-puckering. Flavors from the nose don't necessarily carry through to the palate.  M-Wow.

147,4083,BradtheGreat7,4.37,Review taken many times over the past few years. Due for on actual review on BA.  22 oz brown bomber with a screen printed gold and green label. One of my all time favorite labels. Poured into a Ruination Bitter pint glass.  S - wow. Smells like a bomb about to go off. A hop bomb that is. Lots of grapefruit and lemon. Pine like hops with an oily resinous character. Caramel malt drifts in and out of the semi boozy aroma.  T - fruitiness of grapefruit and a lemon bite. Pine resin with the hops doing a lot of the work. Caramel and toffee flavored malt ensure this isn't a 1 sided hop show. Everything sits pretty well together. A touch of hop spices and booze in the finish.  M - big medium body. Texture is typical stone thickness and its remarkable how drinkable this DIPA is while still coating every inch of the mouth with flavor. Even the slight booziness ruination has is very enjoyable. It's stunning how a Brewer can put so much hop flavor while still allowing the drinker to enjoy the hops. Ruination can hold its own with any of the bigger Double ipa's in terms of flavor and drinkability.  O - it took one sip for me to fall in love with this brew. A so readily available dipa packing all this delicious flavor? How could one not love Ruination. A true West Coast Gem and a tribute to what the Stone Brewing Co is all about. I can enjoy this literally any time I want to and that's enough to put a smile on my face. It shows that Stone has been and always will be in the top tier of the world's greatest breweries. Well done.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,magictacosinus,4.22,"Haven't had this for a while, but seeing as I've never reviewed it and am prepping for RuinTen, I thought I'd give this a try once again. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. Freshness date is printed at the side of the bottle as ""08/18/13.""  Pours a slightly viscous, orange amber color complete with about 1-2 fingers of head. Head retention is fairly decent, sticking around for about a half-finger for a while. Hardly any bubbles on this thing. Lacing is semi-decent, but soon fades away as well. Definitely not as monstrous as seemingly advertised, but rather a very elegant looking DIPA, almost in the realm of Pliny (for instance - and I really should stop comparing DIPAs to it). Quite good - barely any complaints here other than the lack of stickiness and head retention.  At the nose, I get immediate dank earthy hoppiness and floral characteristics that, to this day, is very different from Stone's other hoppy beers. The experience is pungent yet breezy, almost feeling like walking through actual citrus and hop groves. Near vegetal characteristics abound such as onion and garlic. There's a fruity, slightly resinous consistency of passion fruit, guava, tangerines, and limes. Malty sweetness abounds in a Sherry-like feel, as well as a little bite from the booze. Pretty fantastic, actually - strives for balance in spite of Stone's usual exaggerations of the style.  The flavor produces a really surprisingly silky texture on the mouth, filled with a sweetened, bready robustness and juicy fruity notes of citrus rinds and tropical varieties. The bittered orange, grapefruit, and passion fruit combo is pretty good here, with a dry, astringent finish that slowly grows in power, and a bit of heat from the booze. Honey and Eastern spices really hit home as well. Not too sticky until it warms up a bit more, and even then, I feel it's less resinous from the hop flavors itself and a lot more from the caramel, close-but-not-quite butterscotch malts. The finish really is astringent, but I've had bigger hop bombs by now, so it seems relatively tame. The booze gets increasingly stronger, so it's wise to make this a sipper.  A pretty extraordinarily balanced offering from Stone, in spite of its undeniable prowess in terms of displaying the brewery's talent at showcasing their hops and big, earthy malty notes. This is very floral and citrusy as I remember it, but I forgot how easy it is to drink compared to other readily available DIPAs. The hops are strong but by no means assault the palate, as the malts hold the fort with juiciness, and it is only semi-dry in feel, as well as not being as alcoholic as others in the style. I should be kicking myself in the face for not buying more single bottles of this in the past. At $3, this is a bargain indeed. Excellent stuff.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,TreyIsWilson,4.36,A - Pours golden orange with a one-finger foamy white head. The recedes to a slam ring leaving tons of soapy lacing.  S - Aroma is piney hops and citrus.  T - The taste is sweet caramel malts and citrus (orange & grapefruit) upfront. Once the sweetness fades it's an assual of piney resinous hops. There is a nice lingering grapefruit bitterness in the finish.  M - Medium bodied with medium carbonation. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy.  O - This is a classic West Coast IPA.

147,4083,linnymtu,4.16,"Poured into a pint glass from 12oz bottle. First off some props for the bottle design, awesome!  A- a generic ipa. Thin white head on a golden color beer. S- probably it's worst characteristic. I like to smell a sweet citrus in an ipa, but since this beer doesn't have that in the taste, it is understandable. T- a very harsh ipa, as the name would suggest. There is no sweetness to counter the hops, but it is done in a good way. Bitterness dominates. M- really attacks your mouth, well done O- very well crafted and a nice detour from most ipas.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Birdmarg741,4.05,"Poured from a bottle into a dimpled mug  A: Pours a hazy yellow orange; nothing overly spectacular.  S: Soapy. Resin, mild citrus and earthy honey. Very calm compared to the taste.  T: Kick right from the beginning. Colored peppery spicy all over the mouth- not simple black pepper, but something a fruity, earthy, and spicy - all at once. It wonderfully hits every part of the tongue - with a strong taste of rasin and raisiny bitterness that lingers long after swallow. Eventually the rasin mellows out to a clean extra hoppy aftertaste that is extremely pleasant and balanced; mostly bitter but with a nonspecific sweetness that alleviates any drying sensation. The sensation is nice enough that any food seems like it may only take away from this enjoyment. If this were the baseline state of my mouth I would never complain. That said- the spiciness and lightness of the beer does make is wonderful with food.  M: Spicy the second it hits your tongue and it lingers - as long as its in your mouth. Highly activating and extremely bright. Feels very carbonated, but that could also be accentuated by the spice prickles. Overall, it feels lighter than its alcohol concentration. Extremely drinkable.  O: Wonderful IPA. Would absolutely have again (and again) just by itself or with any fatty food. For me, this is what an IPA should taste like. It was one of my firsts, and it still is as great as I remember many beer experiences later.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,1sophrosyne1,3.97,"Poured in to an English dimpled pint glass, cold, then allowed to warm over 15 minutes of tasting. A hazy sun peach-gold foundation to a vapid head. A pointillistic foam that clings with a lean of the glass is the only visual appeal. The opaque look is matched by a bready nose. Clean air balances it out with notes of lime, clover, and pineapple. Seeking them out under the yeast and pine is fun, but it would be nice if this complexity were more forward and in balance. With warmth, an odd woody funk shrouds these subtleties even further. The taste is where this creation excels--excusing the mediocrity of other components. It's a blast--specifically, a pepper bomb is the explosion of ruin. Hop spice and pine lead the way with a mid-slurp squeeze of honeydew and licorice that are detectable all the way into the bitter aftertaste. There's caramel wrapped around the malt backbone. Peachy fruit esters give it a unique breadth. And breathing the beer in is more appealing when those flavors are in the mouth. It starts bright and buzzy coming over the lips and flows nicely with a thirst-piercing coolness. It never thickens to the kind of warm chewiness that my teeth are hoping for with each sip. But, there's plenty of carbonation to keep it interesting as the tastes unfurl over the back of the tongue. Overall, this is an uneven experience. But, impatience, in this case, is a virtue. Diving into the liquid itself is so rewarding, that the shortcomings of its appearance and scentscape are forgotten. This is more than just a good IPA, and memorable in ways that just flavor descriptors don't quite capture.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Fantastic lacing coats the glass and forms a complex latticework of foam. This is an opaque DIPA.  S-Fresh baked bread makes up the front of the nose, but as that fades, the pungent hops and grapefruit take over and shock the senses. This smells great. Well balanced.  T-A very hop-forward DIPA, as the name would suggest, but it is not too hopped up. There is a lot of nuance here. Fresh bread and yeast balances well with the tart grapefruit and hoppy goodness. Some citrus fruits make their presence known as it leaves a slightly tannic, but pleasant, aftertaste.  MF-Smooth at the front of the palate with light carbonation. Finishes dry and crisp as expected from a hopped up DIPA. Body is full and rich. Near perfection.  O-My favorite DIPA. A lot of nuance and depth to this brew, but every aspect makes itself known.

147,4083,stella77artois,4.34,"22 oz. bottle poured into pilsener glass.  A - Pours a medium yellow orange, bright and pretty. Clear. An approximate 2 inch head formed and dissipated very slowly. Gorgeous looking brew.  S - Lot's and lot's of hops. Some grapefruit and a bit of lime. Also noticed a fresh cut grass / fresh air aroma. Very pleasant.  T - Could just be my palate, but according to many reviews, this stuff ""ruins"" your palate it's so full of flavor. I have to disagree slightly with those who have that opinion. It's a damn good tasting beer, but there are ""stronger"" tasting DIPA's out there. But this isn't a bad thing. Lot's of quality tasting hops. Noticed only a very small amount of grapefruit, but A LOT of minty, grassy hops. Overall not the most complicated tasting brew, but it's very, very good. Aftertaste is pleasant, not sour as is the case in many IPA/DIPA's.  F - On the lighter side feeling wise for a DIPA. Not too thick, feels good on the tongue. A fair amount of carbonation noticed.  O - A very good beer that IMO doesn't quite ""ruin"" the palate as claimed. Still, an extremely flavorful and pleasant IPA. Highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,McStagger,4.38,"One of the first DIPA's I ever tried. Re review to see how it stacks up to some of the big dogs.  A: Pours out a fairly hazy golden yellow orange. Two fingers khaki white head dissipates slowly. Retention is excellent, as is lacing.  S: Loads of spicy malt. Cinnamon, toffee, caramel. The hops contribute grapefruit, papaya and a bit of dank evergreen.  T: Sweet malts in the beginning. . Extremely bright mid palate of tropical fruit. Finish is potent, with a resinous bitterness that runs the length. What one might imagine pine sap tasting like. Aftertaste is a return to the same tropical fruit, in addition to grapefruit rind. Aftertaste of granny smith apple peel combined with soapiness.  M: Appropriately textured. Medium bodied for a DIPA.  O: Now that I have a bit more context, this beer makes more sense. Yes, it's incredibly hoppy, but it's also incredibly malty. As hopped out as it is, it still maintains a strict sense of balance with the malt profile. However, this huge malt bill doesn't tip the scales in the body of the beer. It's medium bodied and (somewhat) refreshing on the palate. Deliciously complex beyond the bitterness, this beer is amazing.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BarrytheBear,4.1,"Bottle dated best by 08/18/13 dumped ceremoniously into a tulip. Purchased as a hop fix at Peterson's Wine during a brief recent respite in Napertucky.  Pours a nice medium orange with a full finger of white puff. Continual march of tiny bubbles when back lit and a full curtain of white sheeting on the glass: punishing.  Big hop oils on the nose, some pineapple juice, and a touch of light citrus. It's nice, but it's surprisingly tame.  Alternately sticky and creamy somehow. Sharp and abrasive bittering hops throughout. Hop oils seethe along the tongue and seek out every last taste bud. It's a war of attrition and Ruination is fuckin' pissed. The teasy coquette of citrus that flashed her goodies on the nose has been summarily taken by a marauding gang of pine needle dicked hooligans.

Smell: Elegant West Coast citrus and tropical fruit: grapefruit, orange, mango, tangerine, pineapple, all of which are tinged with a splash of lemon zest. It also features a little pine spice. Surprisingly, pale malts, caramel, and toffee are also present.  Taste: It is more of a mélange than a hop bomb, though it does offer quite a bit of hop bite and spice. It is tame at first, with much of the maltiness and citrus upfront. Sweet caramel, toffee, grapefruit, tangerine, mango, orange, and lemon zest. Then the bitterness comes into play.

S: Straight out of the bottle, floral hop notes, light on the citrus, grapefruit bitterness, with a touch of malts....  T: A beer of 2 stories (or 3)... starts off very hoppy, grapefruit-citrus, light tropical fruits.... then moves into the malts which while mild and not overly sweet, are noticeable above the hops.... As you finish your sip, the hops return with a bit more grass, pine bitterness... It also seems that cold out of the fridge I personally get more malts coming out, and as it warms up it gets much more hoppy... it also becomes more flat and not as tasty...  M: Bright, fresh, well balanced in carbonation and mouth feel for something with such high IBU... only a slight dryness on the finish.  O: Haven't tried other Stone IPA's, but would say this is fairly representative of a California IPA... It has an amazing smell, looks great and overall tastes pretty good, though I did find how it changed over temperature a bit of a downside.

147,4083,Roguer,4.1,"A - Beautiful sparkly copper/orange color, actually some decent carbonation, but a wee bit difficult to see through the translucence. Poured a thick head (almost three fingers) on purpose. Beautiful thick lacing on the glass.  S - Strong grapefruit rind, bitter, not particularly sweet, no alcohol scent. Clean.  T - The bitterness hits immediately, with grapefruit and other citrus rind hitting all parts of the tongue. I'm surprised to find very little sweetness. Three phases: initial citrus bitterness, followed by a bit of a malty flavor over the tongue, and finally a thin wave of slightly sweet bitterness that cleanses your mouth. This is a step up (for me) from their normal IPA, but I would prefer some more sweetness to balance it all out.  M - First off, the 7.7% is completely hidden; completely. Feels good in the mouth, fairly easy to chew and toss around. The malty second portion is a little oily on the tongue, but that isn't at all unpleasant. I can take in a large mouthful, toss it around, and then gulp it down easily.  O - I prefer this to Stone's IPA; the malts are definitely subdued, and the hops are clearly center stage. However, I don't like it nearly as much as their Enjoy By; some sweetness would give this beer a nice complexity that would improve the experience tremendously (for me). As it is, it's a beautiful, extremely bitter beer, somewhat limited in flavor profile (one obvious hop profile for me, one subdued caramel malt profile).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,DenverHopHead,4.45,"Poured from a bottle with an ""enjoy by"" date of 1/13/14; into a pub glass. Appearance - sunset gold in color. Huge, soapy, white head that hangs around the entire time! Lacing is sticky and layered along the back of the glass. Smell - very hop forward, citrus, pine and floral. A classic aromatic ale from Stone! Taste - very easy drinking 8.2% DIPA! Very hop forward; exactly what a hop head expects from a big West Coast DIPA! Feel - Palate wreaker. If you're not an IPA fan, you don't want to come near this!

147,4083,WunderLlama,4.13,"Bottle outed into a Sam Adams glass ( no this is not blasphemy)  Solid two fingers foam cap that slowly settles down to a thick white lid. Strong , pumped up lacings grab ahold of the sides on the way down. Deep honeyed orange-yellow hue.  Pine with citrus aroma. Clean, crisp, hoppy.  Sharp hoppy bite on the front of the tongue. Hop happy with a strong aftertaste on the back of the tongue. Medium weight on the tongue. You KNOW you are drinking an IPA after the first taste. Classic hop bitterness. If you like IPA 's , this is a beer for you.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,LambicPentameter,4.07,"Poured out of a 12 oz brown bottle into a large snifter. No discernible 'drink by' or 'bottled on' dates.  A - Head is present, but a little weak--three-quarters finger and disappears into a lace on top of the liquid about 60 secs later. Lacing is prominent but also fades quickly. Body is a beautiful orange-yellow glow.  S - Piney, herbal, some alcoholic ether bite as well. I like the smell but wish it was a bit stronger.  T - More pine, hoppy bitterness, maybe some grapefruit as well peeking through.  M - Aftertaste is bitter but the body is smooth and makes this a very drinkable DIPA, in spite of its ""ruinous"" reputation.  Overall, a very solid beer. There are other double IPAs I would probably drink first but this one is a quality crafted beer that has no major criticisms from me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jamescain,4.08,"I can't count the number of times I've had this beer and I still can't believe I've never reviewed it. Well I guess now is the time. It pours a hazy amber-yellow with a white head about a finger thick that slowly fades to a thin lacing. The smell is straight up piney goodness with hints of grapefruit and citrus. The taste is pallet crushingly bitter. But its more then that, there is a complexity you wouldn't think you would get from a hop bomb. Grapefruit is the predominate flavor with subtle malty notes still not lost amongst the hops. The mouthfeel is medium and approachable with a dry finish. Too often DIPAs are sweet and sticky. Overall I've always enjoyed this beer but now I've finally reviewed it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jdhowe,3.24,"Enjoy by 06/27/13 printed on the bottle.  I've had a lot of trouble with this brew. I was initially unimpressed but supposed maybe I'd just gotten a bad bottle and gave it another shot. Then I was sold an out of date package only to later realize that the beer was not so fresh as would be intended. Thanks for having inscrutably small ""best by"" labeling, Stone -- now I know where to look, but to a consumer in a store one might miss it entirely as I did on first pass. So now I've picked up the freshest single I could find and am ready to review this beer, giving it the full benefit of the doubt on all previous attempts.  Poured a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  A: Pours a nearly clear amber with a bubbly but flimsy half-finger head, which dissipates very quickly leaving minor lacing. Points here for the clarity and color, at least.  S: I quite like this. Pine, some spice, citrus, and malt sweetness are strong and portend a flavorful experience.  T: Really a let down. The taste is thin on flavorful hop oils and malt, dominated by bitterness, which is lasting but not in a way that makes me excited about continuing. The pine, malt, and citrus from the nose are all evident (in roughly that order) but everything is just dominated by the bitterness of the hops, forming a poor balance. I've certainly tasted much worse beers and much less flavorful IPAs, but this is not a strong showing for Stone and the negative tenor of this review is probably coming from an expectation that this beer just can't fulfill. On warming the citrus shows a little stonger, the pine and bitterness mellow a bit, but the bitterness still dominates.  M: Again very nice. Well balanced carbonation with a smooth-finishing body make this a very drinkable beer.  O: If it only tasted better, this really could have been an excellent beer. As it is, I'm ready to write this one off as another offering of Stone's that just isn't nearly as good as their best.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,rlee1390,4.27,"A-Clear orange, two finger head that leaves some lacing.  S-Good deal of hops, citrus, grass and pine with a nice balance.  T-Great balance, mild malt, citrus notes, grass a nice bitterness in the finish and a sharp hop bite.  M-Medium bodied, nicely carbonated and some hop resins.  O-A great DIPA. The day I had it, it was a little too warm out but I'll seek it ago again. This time the beer was roughly 2 months old so hopefully I can find it even fresher.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,diddly,4.71,"Poured from a bomber to a tulip glass  Slightly hazy, gold color, with a thick, bubbly white head, which dissipates. Lacing on the glass is fairly thick and long-lasting.  Smells richly of hops - little bit of that cat urine aroma, but also some grapefruit notes, and a little bit of clove, for what that's worth. There's also a nice sweet scent to the beer, just to show it's not all hops.  The taste is exactly what I'm looking for in the style. Beautiful, rich hop tones right up front and at the end. There's balance, as well, but hops are obviously what this beer is about. Grapefruit and pine are the dominant flavors, with good sweetness for balance.  Feels medium to heavy, medium carbonation, not too sweet or bitter.  Overall a great imperial IPA, and one of the best out there. Great hoppiness, but simultaneously balanced.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,SerialTicker,4.31,"Enjoy by 6/27/13 ... this seems to be a pretty fresh bottle. 12oz bottle poured into Samuel Adams Perfect Pint glass.  Appearance: A crystal clear yellow-orange color. I had about three fingers of a creamy head that lasted quite awhile. Lacing is very nice.  Smell: I find it subtle, but good ... no thanks to my aggressive pour, the head was so thick that I could barely pick many aromas out of this one. Once it died down, I got some more. Pretty sweet smelling, but definitely more piney and spicy than grapefruity.  Taste/feel: It's a good one. The taste has quite a bit of sweetness at first, but the bitterness lingers on the back of the tongue upon swallowing. Given that it's 100+ IBUs, you can expect it to be pretty damn bitter. I get a LOT of resinous, piney hops in this one, but there's malt sweetness to keep it from being too bitter... I even get a somewhat biscuity taste on the finish. As it warms up, the malt becomes more pronounced, and there's a slight alcohol burn on the finish of each sip. It's definitely not a balanced beer, as it's more bitter than sweet, but that's not a bad thing -- unless of course, you can't stand a bitter beer. Despite the bitterness, Ruination is an easy drinking, smooth beer. As good as the beer tastes, the burps are even better, I think... supper hoppy deliciousness. Only Hopslam has a better tasting burp! The taste of this beer lingers quite awhile after each sip, but I don't mind at all, since it's pleasant.  Ruination is another beer from Stone that I definitely approve of. At $3.29 a 12oz bottle though, it's kind of hard to recommend, as there are plenty of IPAs, I think, that are just about equally as good (and more balanced) for about $2 a single or $10 a sixer. At the same time, Ruination has something about it that isn't quite like other DIPAs out there, so I'd definitely recommend trying it. Excellent beer, and the high ratings are justified, I think.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Ham-Nord,4.26,"A: Pours a cloudy pale golden colour. About ½ inch of head with lacing down the glass.  S: Very strong hop aroma reminiscent of tropical fruits. Smells deliciously hoppy and sweet.  T: Great hop flavour up front with a powerful, yet balanced bitterness afterwards. Not much malt flavour, but there is some sweetness throughout.  M: Medium body, well carbonated. Very bitter.  O: This is a fantastic IPA. It is quite bitter with a beautiful hop aroma, but this is definitely not a sessionable beer. Best to enjoy one and then move along to your next beer of the day.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Taste - Gets your attention at the first sip. Malt and Grapefruit. Then the hops, Citrus, Pine, Flora. Quite Bitter and all in your face, and all delicious.

Mild carbonation, good lace drapes, half finger of retention.  S - Great hop profile. Very pungent. Juicy, citrus, sugar. Lovely hop forward, West Coast IPA. Sugary/syrupy fruits were there with a dank hop profile. Lovely.  T - Great grapefruit and sweet tropical fruits up front with lot's of depth of flavour. Turns to a giant bitter hop finish.  M - Strong bitterness as expected. Good carbonation, medium to full body and good carbonation.  O/D - I thought this was an IPA when I bought it but turns out it's a DIPA. Strong for the weaker of the styles, and probably appropriate for the bigger. A very well crafted IPA with massive yet restrained characteristics that are in your face, but not prohibitively so. Great all aspects. Sessionable yet deserving of attention and small sips.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,retry4z,3.84,"Served from a 22oz bottle ($6) at room temperature into a Stein mug.  Clear copper with persistent tan head.  Citrucy smell combined with hops and pine, some alcohol.  Even for a ""confirmed hop head"" like myself, this is an overwhelming amount of bittering hops (must have changed the recipe over the past two years, because it is unpalatable now), citrus, and pine flavor. Barely anything else (malt) gets through the grossly unbalanced bitterness.  Medium-bodied, medium carbonation. Goes down smoothly.  Overall a solid IIPA but not worth checking out. Instead, go for Lagunitas' Hop Stoopid for a much more balanced and flavorful option.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

M - Nice to drink, it's a lower ABV for an IIPA, so it's not too boozey. Good crisp taste, with light to medium body. Nice carbonation.  O - Great IIPA.

Appearance- A nice orange golden appearance with a little cloudiness, head dissipated but left a nice lace on its trip down the glass.  Nose- Hops and small hints of evergreen with a pinch of floral notes.  Taste- Intense hoppy bitterness as intended. What stands out is that while the hops are obviously the dominant element here, it is not so overwhelming. In other words, it's not just like you're drinking hop juice, it's a beer crafted around the hop flavor. Some slightly sweet maltiness underneath to soften the blow a little bit. Finishes bitter but leaves you in anticipation for the next round with a little bit of sour fruit once it has opened up.  Mouthfeel- Maintains its body throughout the sip, extremely smooth for such a hopheaded brew, and hits the palate with a vigor of a beer with much less of an ABV.  Overall- A treat when you're in the mood for a powerful dose of hops. More well balanced than a majority of pale ales centered around 1 or 2 main flavors with its body and drinkability.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

There is a gummy slab of splotchy lacing present throughout the quaff - a slow and deliberate one, to be sure.  Take a whiff and you will be punched in the nose by a massive pine fist with fingers of honey, apple and grass. Take a sip and your palate is greeted by an initial orange peel, which is supplemented by a thick rush of grapefruit that eases out in a pleasant finish. Yet ... despite the 100+ IBU, there is nothing harsh about it; this is an easy hopbomb that does not expolde in the palate - it even seems to melt in a quiet crispiness.

147,4083,KYGunner,4.05,"Gorgeous pale orange coloring with an almost unfiltered resemblance, this IPA sets up a thick and frothy head.  Nice citrus notes of grapefruit, tangerine and orange. Subtle pine and flowers sit at the back of the nose as the citrus notes disappate quickly.  Strong maltiness hits the tongue first and then piney resins finish. Earthy tones get caught between the two in a smooth feel. Bits of orange can be caught hiding in the middle but musty and harsh metallic tastes hold the aftertaste to ruination the palate.  I must admit that it seems to be Stones intention to ruin ones palate but its just that, that makes this beer lose points. Why create an IPA with clean smooth citrus and earthy tastes and then let a strong metallic taste ruin it all?",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,willhopforfood,4.79,This is a great example of a double IPA even with the low ABV %.  Everything juicy and citrus on the nose and continues to the palate. No boozey taste noticeable at all.

147,4083,dar482,4.54,"The beer pours in beautiful hazy gold orange color with a one finger head. Very cloudy.  The aroma is great. Rich juicy orange, freshly squeezed grapefruit. There’s a breadiness there as well along with pine.  The taste is pretty spot on. It hits you immediately with a gentle bitterness throughout. The aftertaste isn’t too cloying, but it’s of bitterness like a grapefruit pit, resin, and pine. The flavor is of dried out grapefruit. There’s an easing of bready malts that cleans up this beer however.  The finish is not as offensive as many Double IPAs out there. It’s ridiculously dry, but it doesn’t have this awkward cloying feeling. It’s an enjoyable bitterness that tastes natural of grapefruit pit and lingers lightly.  This is not as big of a hop bomb as Enjoy By, but I saw that as both a compliment and hit. For Stone beers, definitely try out Enjoy By, but on the regular, I would definitely prefer this. It’s so well balanced. One of the best Double IPAs out there.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The nose, which has been begging for attention from the moment the cap came off, now receives its due. Intense florals and bitter citrus. Stubborn, but not obnoxious, carbonation envelops the mouth chamber. Taste confirms what the nose foretold. HOP to it now, o my tongue.

Sweet and citrusy with some hop character as well.  Taste: Love the balance of sweet malts up front and very hoppy bitterness aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation. Hoppy bitterness REALLY sticks around for a while in the back of the throat. And this is expected, seeing as how it's 100+ IBUs which is advertised gloatingly on the bottle.

This trend continued, leaving beautiful lacing throughout. My glass was transformed by the end. S - Pretty soft, sweet aromas. Frosted animal crackers, cookie dough, clover honey, salty caramel. Fresh sourdough baguette quite prominent. A little pineapple too. T - Interesting dichotomy of smooth, full flavor on the tongue, while some really bold hops occupy the back of the mouth and nose. I'm struggling to find comparable flavors, so here goes. I keep getting images of green vegetables: asparagus, kale, celery, cabbage. But this is mostly in the periphery. A bit of orange, but surprisingly few fruit flavors given the style. Front of the mouth enjoys a puffy, frosting sort of sweetness. A very light, salty creamyness is present and isolated on the tongue as well. Needless to say, complex, and hugely entertaining. Good lord. M - Remarkably clean and refreshing through most of the mouth, just a bit of that cream sensation remains after each taste. But those hops! It's like someone's draped a heavy felt cloak over the back of my tongue, mouth and throat. My tongue actually feels heavier. Awesome.

Pours a slightly hazy orange, with a 1.5 inch head, and really good lacing down the glass.  Smells extremely pungent- lots of grapefruit rind and pine. Very herbal.  The bitterness on this is extreme- I feel like my tongue is being split down the middle. Just a lightning bolt of hops in this one. It's not balanced in the slightest, but it never claims to be. Lots of grapefruit and pine, like a typical West Coast IPA. It tastes interesting, but the extreme, astringent, ""tongue-splitting"" bitterness just makes it unpleasant. I love very bitter beers, but this one is just too much for me.  Medium bodied, mouthfeel starts crisp then ends a bit creamy. The alcohol is slightly present. Low carbonation.

Resin, fresh cut grass, grapefruit, dank and catty hops begin the aroma explosion. Pine and onion and a subtle hint of bready malt round things out. Smells wonderful.  Flavor doesn't disappoint. Initially reminiscent of sweettart fruitiness, the profile turns lightly bready mid palate, then finishes bitter and resiny. Grapefruit pith and tangerine underlie a bready malt backbone that is fairly subtle. Resin really dominates.  Body is moderate, with moderate carbonation and a fair amount of hop astringency. Alcohol warmth is slight.  Excellent example of the style. Decidedly bitter, but with enough flavoring and aroma hops to really make things interesting and complex. My only gripe would be I wish some of the characteristics in the aroma translated more into the flavor. Still a great brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,bcsbeer,4.72,"A: Hazy golden orange with a white head that was completely gone before it was consumed. Little to no lacing.  S: Big on the hops with grapefruit and pine.  T: Like your sucking on a sap covered green pine cone that was marinated in grapefruit juice. There are some hints of orange and lemon and sweet malts.  M: I was a little worried about the carbonation when the head ran away, but it did not disappoint. Finish highly bitter with some syrupy sweetness. Took the palate for a joy ride.  O: You better have your PHD in IPA for this one. Stone has pegged the IBUs needle at 100+ we don't know how fast we are going. If you think you can handle it take it for a spin.

Get a little bit of the alcohol flavor as well. M - Well balanced, not much else to say. O - Stone is solid in everything they do, this is an above average IPA that is pretty much available everywhere. An easy go-to for any hop lover.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BeernDrum,4.34,Excellent IPA. Nice amber color. Nice white head. Smells of citrus and a little grassy. Nice taste with a little orange. Nice bitter taste that I enjoy. This is a great choice if you are going to spend high end $. A better choice than Hopslam. Really worth the $ for high quality IPA. But fathead still a 1st choice.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Dave1999,4.33,"Looks impressive pours a cloudy orange with a small white head.  The smell is citrus hops, the usual grapefruit and lemons with some biscuit. I would've like the smell to be a bit stronger though.  The taste is much like the smell , fruity with a little bitterness and slightly sweet taste.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation.  Overall an excellent dipa, the abv is well hidden with flavorful hops and pretty well balanced.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

A | Clear, golden color, akin to apple juice. Thin head made of small bubles, lingered several minutes. minimal lacing. Gorgeous beer.  S | Slight fruit, crisp alcohol undertone. it does not have a terribly strong odor, or my allergies are in the way...  T | Strong malt start is quickly blown away by floral hops and rounding finish of alcohol. By the end of swallowing the bitter sections on the back of the tongue light up with the most wonderful sensation that slowly tails off into the lingering bitter after-taste.  M | Thin and very smooth, almost silky. Really allows the crisp bites of hops and alcohol to shine through in the most pleasant of ways.  O | A fantastic über-hop journey. If you are a budding hop-head and are looking to test your pallet on some great hop bombs, this would be a great place to start, followed by Hop Stoopid.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Bosoxfan20,4.3,"A- Poured from a bottle that did not have a bottled on date, but judging by the fact that it was forgotten in my closet for a couple months, it wasn't straight from the factory. A hazy light orange with white head of about a finger or so. Good retention and moderate carbonation. Fantastic lacing.  S- Citrus packed! Terrific aroma as the hop abundance sends the olfactory into a state of shock.  T- Powerful hops. Grapefruit or orange hits you first, followed by a delicious malt base and finishing with a bold bitterness as it ""ruins"" the palate. My bottle was older, but the hops had still yet to mellow. The warmth of the alcohol is the last phase I tasted.  M- Medium bodied. Dry finish, but smooth  O- A level of complexity exists despite the IBU level suggesting a one note song. To Stone's credit, the hop and bitterness level probably does ruin your palate to the point that i wouldn't be comfortable reviewing another beer immediately after this one. Another great IPA by Stone. Much to the delight of a hop head like myself.  12 oz bottle. $10.99 for 4 pk",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,MCain04,4.49,"Bottle 22 oz, $5.99, best by 4/8/13, drank on 2/10/13. Poured into Spiegelau snifter.  Appearance: Clear golden amber color, pure white 2-3 finger head, good retention, moderate lacing.  Smell: VERY nice. Grapefruit, mango, flowers, lots of pine, orange.  Taste: A bit subdued compared to the smell, but still quite nice. Follows along the smell profile, hop-forward taste with a lot of bitterness. Not very much malt at all. Just a tad thin to be world-class though.  Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation, quite smooth. Not too sticky. A bit thin, as above.  Overall: Great DIPA from Stone that would doubtlessly be a staple of mine if available as a six pack for $12 or so. Still a good value at $6 a bomber, but I just don't buy it that often. Hop Henge is better IMO and is at the same price point. Always like to grab a pint of this when it's on tap though.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,sam_bliss,4.71,"22oz bomber  Orange-ish copper crystal-clear beer with a few tiny bubbles serves as the foundation for a monstrous four-finger off-white frothy head. Beautiful. Smells floral and citrusy, fresh and bold, sweet and bitter. After sniffing an aroma predominantly of hops, I am taken aback by the strong roasted malt character providing the base for the taste. Yummy hops and a bit of charred bitterness throw a party on the palate. Ginger, tropical fruits, fields of flowers, and some lemon all shine through. An alcohol kick and caramelly flavor swirl around the cheeks and tongue. The medium-full body washes down with the tang of grapefruit. The beer is thick but carbonated and clean enough not to leave a sticky after-feel, just a residual happy-hoppy tingle.  This brew is kick-ass and complex. Each swig brings something as yet-unnoticed. A bit of tobacco just as liquid touches taste buds. Lilac in the nose. The woody smoothness of single-malt liquor. Brown sugar. Lingering OJ. Perfume of the gods. I could go on for hours. Actually, if I had a keg of this IPA I could go on for days describing flavors, smells, feelings, and experiences. But now I shall just enjoy. For it is quite enjoyable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ScruffySouthpaw,4.33,"Served in a snifter glass (the way it should be drank).  Appearance: Amber with a haze to the body and small bubbles sticking the edge wall of the glass. White head roughly a finger's length.  Smell: Malty hops scent that is complimenting to the nose. Almost feels like a light smell of burnt sugar goes with it, absolutely delish.  Taste: A really nice complexity to it that is almost unforgiving. Talk about robust, rich bitter hop feel complimented with a light caramelness to it that makes you want more and more again.  Mouth: Medium carbonation with hops that just stick your cheeks after finishing.  Overall: Finally after a long time I am giving Ruination what is due, a beer worth having and if not worth keeping. Enjoying this beer with some home made rib eye steak I honestly couldn't ask for anything better at the moment. Rich and strong, It is a little pricey but what good beer isn't nowadays. If you see it and have never had the luxury of trying it and you like IPAs this is a must grab. Salud!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Sokool,4.7,"Poured from 22 oz bottle into an oversized wine glass. Hazy light amber with an inch of off-white head and heavy lacing all the way down. Smells like pine, citrus and...roses (first sniff only). This may be may favorite IPA to date. Wonderfully dry and bitter hop and citrus flavor, backed by a surprisingly solid malty backbone. The mouthfeel was just right, just enough thickness to give it some real substance, but stops well shy of being too syrupy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,stephenjmoore,4.13,"A- Somewhat cloudy, pale-orange body. Thick white head that leaves a mess of lacing all over the glass.  S- Big aromas of piney hops balanced out by sweet toasted malt. Some soapy lemony aromas mixed in.  T- Huge piney hops come through in a big way. Toasted malt balances this one out slightly in taste, but the hops are at the forefront. The citrus flavors comes through towards the end in the way of lemon.  M- Great balance of carbonation and body. Very drinkable, but not something you would glp down.

147,4083,JaredM,4.47,"""Enjoy by 2-25-13""  A: Hazy orange. Pretty cloudy actually, not clear at all. Solid 2 fingers of head, didn't dissipate quickly. Not to much in the way of carbonation.  S: This smells delicious I'll be honest. The hops smell amazing with a very pronounced citrus and pine smell. Wow, my mouth is watering. I'd say the citrus is very orangy maybe even some peach in there.  T: Tastes just like it smells. It's got that bitter hop taste for sure but I'm not blown over by it by any means. In fact, it's very pleasant and extremely refreshing. Remind me to drink this cold on a summer day. Getting a lot of grapefruit coming through in the taste and not so much in the way of the pine. Feeling a bit of the alcohol burn in the chest. The bitterness is lingering.  M: Medium to light on the mouthfeel. Not chewy at all.  O: I was really looking forward to drinking this and it lives up to the hype. I'd like to try the regular Stone IPA for a comparison. I could see the bitterness becoming a little much after a couple. Maybe the regular IPA is toned back in that department? I've seen this beer put into the category of quintessential west coast IPAs and if this is any indication of them then I need to try more!

Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, lemon zest, pine, floral, honey, bread, grass, and herbal earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of hop notes. Taste of big grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, pine, floral, grass, light honey, lemon zest, and piney spiciness. Large amount of floral pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus rind, pine resin, floral, grass, honey, bread, and piney spiciness on the finish for a while. Excellent flavor balance of citrus hop complexity and pine flavors; with big piney citrus bitterness lingering on the finish for a while as expected. Medium carbonation and body; with an extremely sticky, crisp, and slightly creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Imperial IPA. Great intense hop flavor and balance with good complexity; and very smooth to sip on.

Everything as it should be.  S: PINEY, even almost detergent-y hops. That's it...well, maybe if you inhale deeply enough and get really saturated with the aroma, you can pick up a little malt and citrus.  T: Hoppy, but the bitterness is not nearly as overwhelming as the aroma suggests. Actually a nice malt backbone to this beer, and some citrus and bready notes. The finish is where the hops come back for revenge, leaving you with an ever-so-fresh pinesap aftertaste. This character is probably more pronounced in this beer than any other I have had.  M: Full enough to be satisfying, but not thick or chewy.  O: A powerful beer experience, not for the faint of heart. I do have to say this beer is much more than a teeth-melting hop bomb. It just leans more to one end of the spectrum for the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,thecheapies,4.09,"Bomber to tulip. Enjoy by 01.20.13. Uh-oh...  Looks excellent. Stoic two-fingers of bleach-white head on-top of a red-orange hazy body. Lacing is superb.  Excellent nose of grapefruit, pine, and floral hops. There's a staleness to fresh hops that is very appealing. Ruination has it. Hints of toastiness. Light biscuity malts try to pare into the hop assault. Might not be all things complex, but this nose is right in-line with superior DIPAs.  Stinging grapefruit and peeled layers of pine and herbaceousness. Stinging booze, too. The malts want to caramelize and transpose the beer. It's right at the point where the beer wants to be sweeter and maltier than it should be. Still has dryness. Hearty bitterness staves the malts off a bit. I'm missing the juicy fruitiness of the citrus that I know was there. Too much bread and biscuit. A lashing of the tongue remains on the bill here.  Sudsy and tightly-wound. Body is a bit outspoken. Alcohol cuts right in when it wants to, and that is often.  Listening to 'Today I Was An Evil One' by ""Bonnie"" Prince Billy. When he sings 'painfully receding', I can't help but think of this particular bottle.

147,4083,zeledonia,3.99,"Enjoy by 25 February 2013. Assuming 90-day shelf life, that means bottled 27 November 2012. Could be fresher, but it's still well before the best by date. Tasted 20 January 2013, reviewed from notes.  Pours medium-pale orange with shades of yellow. Very very orangey, brightly colored. Two fingers of big fluffy dense head, good retention and very good lacing. Main complaint is a lack of visible carbonation (there's almost none).  Smell is potently hoppy, but mostly one-dimensional. Very piney, resinous and juicy. It's quite good, but doesn't give me that wow feeling like the best DIPAs do. Clean, balanced, and powerfully piney. I'm hopeful about the malt base, as it seems pretty robust here.  Taste is good. A little less bitter than I expected, though it comes on stronger in the latter stages. Typical DIPA, starting out grainy and lightly sweet (that sweetness is nice), which then gets overpowered by that hop bitterness. Solid.  Mouthfeel is solid. Medium-bodied, slightly sticky. Medium-low carbonation, could be a bit higher. Just fine, though.  A very good DIPA, but not the best around. In season, I'd never pick it over Abrasive, except maybe for cost reasons. Out of seasons, it doesn't measure up to Odell Myrcenary. So while it's quite enjoyable, I can't see myself drinking it very often.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Its been a while since I had it last, and I remember thinking it was ok, but overhyped.  A: Pours a crystal clear light amber with almost 3 fingers width of light khaki colored head which takes a long time to dissipate down and leaves lots of layered and honeycomb lacing.  S: Citrus in the form of grapefruit, lemon and tangerine. A surprisingly bit malt presence to balance it out, with caramel malt sweetness. Smells nice ,but actually not impressive with the hop aroma, could definitely be stronger.  T: Hops more prominent on the tongue than was on the nose. Grapefruit up front followed by citrus rind and piney bitterness on the finish. This is quite bitter. I remember being disappointed when I originally had this, thinking the name was deceiving because the bitterness wasnt as advertised, but I was wrong ! ( I think I was drinking a lot of Finest Kind at that time which may have contributed). This this is a bitter bomb. I havent had a beer with this much hop bitterness in a while, which is nice. That being said, it doesnt have a lot else to offer, and I do prefer IPAs with a nice balance of a multitude of hop flavors. Bonus points for the degree of hop bitterness, but there are certainly more characteristics to be enjoyed in hops than just the bitterness.  M/D: Awesome mouthfeel. Its so smooth up front, with a near perfect body, and then a biting finish that leaves you ready for more. Drinkability is great.  O: Overall, this is better than I remembered it. Really a nice job of bringing in your face bitterness, and impressive in that regard. But theres more to IPAs than bitterness, and this one doesnt bring much of those other components. Certainly a beer Id drink again, and if you have never tried it, its a must try.

Fresh tangerines and grapefruit. Slight hop zest in the background. Perfect smell for an IPA.  T- Starts off juicy and tropical, grapefruit particularly. Progresses into a piney, floral hop character that leaves a nice bitterness on the tongue. The high IBU is really balanced here, it's not astringent or cloying.

147,4083,abeerwiseguy,4.4,"Grabbed a 22 oz bottle of Stone Brewery’s Ruination IPA on the way home. The beer style is American Double / Imperial IPA and this one is a hop lover’s fiesta. ABV of 7.7% on the bottle.  Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a Pilsner glass with a large head that slowly left a thick and lacy reside while the beer was eagerly consumed. Poured as a cloudy, hazy, golden color.  Lots of complex smells greet the nose. Had distinct hop dominated aromas of piney lemon / orange citrus and spiciness, with just a hint of malty sweetness in the background.  Rich tastes of citrus fruits and hop bitterness with some malty sweet flavors. This beer tastes just like it smells but is very complex.  The mouth feel for this beer is rich and full bodied with a fully carbonated, lingering hop dominated finish.

Taste is not as bold as 100 IBU would convey, it's actually tamer than many New Belgium brews (such as Snow Day or Red Hoptober - two brews I use as benchmarks for IBUs) even though the NB offerings are much lower on the IBU scale. The grainy malt flavor doesn't fight the hops as much as balance them. The wonderfully bitter hops come in at the finish and beg me to drink more as if to even things out. Banana esters and mango dance on the middle of the tongue as I take a second sip. Mouthfeel is thick and wonderful, allowing the luscious fruity and grainy flavors to mingle and tantalize the senses. I believe this hop bomb is one of the top IPAs available and will definitely drink again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,JMScowcroft,4.74,"Stone Ruination IPA - India Pale Ale - Bottle (Six Pack) I grabbed a sixer of these at our local Shaw's (which carries a great microbrew selection) when I was unable to locate some Heady Topper.  Look - Gradient amber from dark to light, very minimal head even with an aggressive pour. Hoping this wasn't due to expired product. No dates labeled to check. Typical Stone labeling, badass. Moderate, welcome fizz. Smell - Sweet and citrus, but hops immediately obvious (in a good way). Taste - Hops galore followed by smooth citrus. After taste is hoppy, hop heads will love while others will not. Mouthfeel - This beer possesses the fabled ""throat-bomb"", which is a welcome finish to this beer. Drinkability - Due to its potency and strength, only a few of these are needed, but I will say that I never had a warm sip.  I thoroughly enjoyed this brew, so much so it inspired me to write my first beer review in almost four years. Another excellent Stone brew!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Tomhet,4.47,"Appearance: Intermediate color of golden straw and amber; pretty transparent in appearance. Finger and a half head dissipates fairly quickly and leaves mild lacing.  Aroma: Grassy and floral hops sting the nose from the outset. After this settles, a little lemony zest lingers before some grapefruit and piney notes appear. Remarkably complex aroma.  Taste: This boasts 100 IBUs, but this isn't so much an indication of ironclad bitterness as much as it is a dynamic, multi-faceted flavor. First thing that hits me is the aforementioned floral lemon zest, which is quickly usurped by a strong amalgamation of piney hops. Perhaps the best thing about this is the biting blast that hits the tongue immediately (it makes its way up to the base of the nose too; potent shit) and allows a slightly waxy mouthfeel to usher in the surge of flavors described above. Each sip brings something new to the table, this stuff is top-notch.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,chicagoish,3.92,"A: Dark golden, . Thin clingy head that looks soapy.  S: Smells piney and resiny with a little bit of citrus. The hops take over for sure, smells like sticking your face into a fresh bag of hops.  T: Huge hop bitterness, perhaps too much. Some subtle bready malt character. Very Piney  M: Thin and dry on the tongue.  O: This beer would be really good with some spicy food. I enjoyed it, my only complaint however is it was a little one dimensional.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,puboflyons,4.28,"From a 12 fl. oz. bottle. Sampled on January 4, 2013.  It pours a fairly cloudy pale yellow-amber with a decent but short lived white fizzy head. It looks exactly like an IPA should so give that a 5.0.  The aroma is like a volcano of floral, perfume, bitter hops tearing through my nostrils like a nasal spray through a stuffy nose. Woah! Is that strong! Also a tad zingy.  The body is around medium and is also creamy.  The taste is a carnival of hops with a low profile grainy character that is like David when compared to the Hop Goliath. But in this case Goliath wins.  I can see why hop lovers give this a world class rating. Me, I like my hops to be more subtle and balanced rather than the entire package. But when it comes to being an Imperial Double IPA it has to be one of the best anywhere.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jj311,4.72,"Pours a beautiful cloudy, pale orangeish color, with a nice and frothy off-white foam head.  A really sweet, fruity, oily citric aroma up front, with a little bit of light maltyness that remains overpowered by the abundance of hops.  The taste starts off with some sweet malt and a slight hind of breadyness up front, followed by a gush of various hop flavors perfectly blended together and a sharp bitter finish. The bitterness really gives it it's defining characteristic, yet the fruity, almost piney hop flavors keep the bitterness in check, A magnificent balance. All flavors work in perfect harmony with this brew.  Wow! This is the first word that comes to mind when sampling this beer. From a beautiful appearance, to the oh-so-pleasant and enticing aroma and the complex and absolutely enjoyable flavors, I found this to be one of the most enjoyable beers I have tasted. Be forewarned, drinking one of these is sure to ruin any chance of tasting any other beer for the rest of the day. The 100+ IBUs really give the taste buds a work-over.  This is very drinkable for those who love extra bitter IPAs. This is going to be on the top of my list of favorites, and one of my most recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

T: Huge hop bitterness with a subtle bready malt character. I pretty much only get pine and grapefruit out of this.  M: Thin and dry on the tongue.

147,4083,Dusty6467,5,"A: poured a hazy copper color with a 2 finger head that dissipates pretty quick but leaves nice lacing.  S: very bold hop smell, citrus pine is overwhelmingly awesome. This smells just like a bag of freshly opened brewing hops  T: slight malty carmel taste that is overtaken with the hoppy bitterness when it hits the taste buds in the back of the mouth, alcohol is almost completely hidden, very floral aftertaste that stays with you a while. Not balanced but doesn't matter when the taste is so rewarding  M: perfect amount of carbonation, not as carbonated as some but more than others, with such a wild flavor it is quite clean and refreshing  O: after a few years of drinking IPAs and pursuing hoppier brews the more I drink them, I feel that I stumbled upon this one at the perfect time. As the bottle says, this shouldn't be someone's 1st IPA, or they'll likely hate it. This is an amazing beer that uses hops to their fullest!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,bnes09,4.03,"Light copper color and completely see-through. Big head on the pour which lasts forever and coats the glass in lacing.  Aggressive pine-like, grapefruit and soapy hop qualities in the nose. Just a tad of honey sweetness.  Mild bready malt flavor with a hint of honey. Make way for the hop bomb which attacks your palate with an unrelenting onslaught of grapefruit, lemon rind, soap and sharp pine needles. Very pungent and definitely a west coast brew. There's a touch of juicy melon to balance the bitterness but it doesn't go very far.  Medium bodied and well carbonated with a dry finish.  Good DIPA. True to the style. A bit unbalanced though.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,Ivegotmule,4.72,"My first review is a 12 oz Stone Ruination IPA. Poured freely into my 420 pint glass. Enjoy by 12/23/12. This is my ""go to"" which is why it is first.  Appearance. 4. The lowest point of this beer. It is a light golden color with a one finger white head. Nice retention and lacing with some bubbles rising from underneath. Not overwhelmingly beautiful.  Smell. 4.5. Moving up the point scale it is exactly what I want to smell in a DIPA. Hops, obviously, as it states many times on the bottle. But not just blatant hops.. Grapefruit at first. Piney and a bit grassy to follow. Also a solid malt smell somewhere underneath all of that.  Taste and mouthfeel. Both 5. The taste matches the smell. Malt up front and tons of complex hops everywhere else. Great bitter grassy finish. Mouthfeel is nice. Good carbonation and stickiness. I like that I don't want to sip it. I want to fill my mouth with the flavor.  Overall 4.5. Not the best beer I've had. But I always get a 4 pack when I hit the local Total Wine. For the price and reasonable abv, one of the best DIPAs. But like it says on the back, if you haven't developed a love for hops, this is not the place to start. Drink responsibly!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Was an amazing mix, and hope I can get one more before I have to leave town.  * The stout mellows out the bitterness of the Ruination but, if your a real hop head it still has enough bite. I'm not a huge fan of stouts but, this mix has greatly opened my taste...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,LeRose,4.35,"This might be strange - I was warned about the palate-wreckage. But my first sip was OMG I love this stuff...and I'm not huge on enjoying bitter. It whacks you right upside the head, gets your attention, then calms down nicely. Nice brown color, funky thick creamy head - looks kind of like a toasted marshmallow. Flavor changed quite a bit as it warmed up. Bitterness slam initially, but love the shot of grapefruit rind bitterness on the finish. It is a very distinctive bitter taste. Do get a little underlying sweetness and malt that lingers just about right, then the citrus bitters kick in and clean it all up so you can have another pull. Maybe not an every day drinker, but sure like having it around - this was a very nice, special treat.  Reviewed from notes.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Sludgeman,4.3,"Rested on May 26, 2020 - I first rated this beer in 2012 and then I have always taken it for granted.

The aroma is out of this world the minute you pour the ale and stick your mouth on the glass the hops assault your olfactory senses with everything that an IPA should be.

Pretty much ideal.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,StonedTrippin,4,"this is a good imperial ipa, but i think i like the regular stone ipa better. this one pours a mostly clear honey color, a tint of orange to it, and quite a nice sudsy head. the nose is all lupulin, hop essence, and a touch of fruit, maybe apples or something to this in smell only. flavor carries the big bold hop nose, but it also has a nice medium malt body underneath it. possible wheat additions become curious towards the finish, but this is a hop bomb all the way. it tastes fresh, almost as fresh as the enjoy by, but it lacks a real hop identity i think, i dont know which hops are used, but i know its not quite bitter, its not quite sweet, its just sort of hoppy, if that makes sense. good carbonation, sessionably smooth, lots of alcohol but it can hardly be tasted. overall an outstanding version of the style, but i think a more distinct hop varietal would really pop this beer off.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Jugs_McGhee,3.2,"Served on-cask at The Daily Pint in Santa Monica into a New Belgium goblet. Reviewed from notes.  A: Pours a two finger beige colour head of some cream, nice thickness, and good retention. Colour is a non-opaque caramel-copper. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show.  Sm: Heavy floral hops - cascade, certainly. Clean malts. A bit of butterscotch. Oily piney hops. A moderate strength aroma.  T: Quite light, a result of the cask serving type. Oily pine, resinous grapefruit hop character, fragrant clean floral hops, a bit of pear, and some clove. Grapefruit is dominant but not overbearing. Clean malts form the foundation. Butterscotch is present (diacetyl?). It's fresh, tasty, and clean. Nicely layered. A bit simple, but mostly balanced and enjoyable. Some dry hop bitterness surfaces on the climax - though only briefly. It's decently concealed. Not a real subtle flavour profile, but subtlety has never been Stone's strong suit.  Mf: Light, clean, undercarbonated (a victim of the cask), smooth, wet, and thin (again, the pesky cask). Doesn't suit the flavour ideally, but generally so. A bit oily.  Dr: Drinkable and enjoyable. I'd prefer it on tap, no doubt. It is nice, though. Beats my low expectations. A nice beer from Stone, but nothing to write home about. I'd like to try it on proper kegging. Hides its ABV well. Priced highly at $8.00 for the underwhelming quality.  C+",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BoneyLee,4.83,"Served from the big bottle and poured quickly into a small pint glass in order to release a larger head than I normally would. Created two inches of mostly white smelly head that didn't hang around for more than a minute or two.  A: very attractive amber color. The kind I hold up to the sun or a bright light every time.  S: A big smell of the head is full of citrus and pine and peppery hoppness. It smells like so many things it's hard to hang it on just one, but citrus would have to be it.  T: This is why we're here. The taste of this beer strikes the blow that it's namesake claims to; which is that it ruins every other beer you taste. Of course there are those who find a double IPA too bold. This is not the beer for them. And this is also not the beer that just clobbers you over the head with hops and hops alone. This brew has the perfect balance of bitterness up front where you want SOME but not alot, and the crisp citrussy finish that makes you keep gulping. It also avoids the overly malty taste that is often present in 2x ipa brews that is used to bring up the alcohol content. IMO that can really get in the way of the spirit of an IPA.  MF: just enough carbonation. doesn't sting like a belgian and doesn't fall flat like a lager can.  O: For my money, just about the best IPA in the world, if not the best overall beer in the world. It is a very consistent brew for a widely distributed one, Stone could keep their legacy alive with this beer alone, but luckily they have several others that are nearly as good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,MightyMonk,4.65,"From the bottle to a Belgian style snifter. I could smell the hop aroma as I poured this fantastic beer.  It pours a glowing amber gold color with a light colored head that rises high and lingers. Lacing well with foamy bubbles of floral hoppy aroma. It doesn't disappoint in the appearance or smell categories! The taste is a jolt of hoppy citrus, grapefruit and orange pulp that is calmed by the malty sweet flavor that seems an afterthought but does the job. The balance seems perfect. It is awake in the mouth with plenty of carbonation and peppery,sweet,citrus notes on a medium to heavy feel in the mouth. This is one of the best DIPA's I have tried to date. Top of the list to find a clone recipe.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BigBarley,4.62,"I've been waiting to try this beer until I was SURE I could consider myself a hop head. I'm gonna review it as I try it, so opinions are subject to time-influenced alteration.  A - Looks great! Yields a nice, foamy head with great retention. The Beer is a cloudy, dark yellow. Kinda somewhere between white grapefruit juice and orange juice. Never seen an IPA that looked quite like this one.  S - All I smell is hops. Hoppy hoppy hops. Amazing, strong invasion of citrus, flower and zest all together. Hard sniff reveals a hidden malt sweetness just below the hoppy madness. One of the best beers I've ever smelled, hands down.  T - Wow. The hop flavor doesn't hit you all at once, it tricks you for a split second into believing it's just a double IPA. Then as soon as your confident you can handle it, BAM, hop explosion. The hop flavor tastes complex though. It's not like the just overhopped it for the sake of over hopping, you can actually taste the time and effort they put into this beer. Layers of subtle citrus, kinda spicy lemon, shine just below the bitter hops character. You can get a good feel for the malt character at the very front of the sip, but it's wiped out seconds later. Still, it comes through in a surprisingly balanced way, which just adds to the enjoyment. Mild floral notes, malt is vaguely biscuit with a hint of sweet, As it warms the hops tend to increase in lemony note, but not without maintaining the hop flavor. Overwhelming in gulps, but extemely pleasant as a slow-going beer. ONLY RECOMMENDED FOR EXTREME HOP ENTHUSIASTS  M - Just a little thinner than I expected, but thick enough for the style. Bright carbonation, very active. Tingly and crisp. Enjoyable, although I personally prefer thicker double IPAs in general. This works well, however.  O - Enjoyable in all aspects, this beer both surprised and satisfied me. I imagined it differently, expecting it to be a little more like Hop Stoopid (the only other beer that I've had that can even touch such hoppy glory) but I'm glad I was wrong. It's good to see that this beer accomplished an extremely high IBU and a unique hop character, while avoiding being a copycat of any kind. There's no other beer quite like this, but again, I could say that about any Stone Brew. One of my new Top 5",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Mavigo,3.33,"Ugh. I've really been liking Stone's beers, but im a little nervous on this one, the other ales I've had from them have been pretty strong in terms of hop flavor, so I can't even imagine their IPA. Or actually I can, let do. Served in a goblet.  A: Pours a hazy golden color, with a single finger off white head that dissipated fast, has some lacing.  S: As expected, very aromatic, major hop overload, flower smell, can smell honey and wheat, grains as well, malts as well, pine too.  T: To be blunt, the hops overpower the other flavors this beer could have, little bit sweet at the beginning, but than abruptly destroyed by the mega hop overload, not too bad, but really really strong hop after taste going on, it'll take 30 minutes for this taste to fade.  M: Refreshing, good amounts of carbonation, not over done or anything, massive hop after taste, to say the least, but its the IPA style.... but on steroids.  O: IPAs arent my cup of tea, or beer or whatever, but this a stand up beer, its refreshing and crisp, its smooth until the hop after taste bashes you over the head but it's not bad, not bad at all.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

T- Malty Hops punching you in the back of the eyes! Fadin' to more lemon tartness. The hops stick around and don't go away after more than two sips.  M- Liked the mouth the best but have no idea why. Hops burn in the back corners of your mouth and gets stuck in your sinuses. Makes it a challenge to pick up flavors after a bit but man I love it! Nice carby kind of feel, fun on your tongue. Extremely light for a Dipa, which is good. God I hate when a Dipa's disgustingly syrupy, it grosses me out after a while.  O- A fun Dipa but I don't know if I'd pick it up again.

A: Lighter than most IIPA's, golden color with nice head. Excellent retention.  S: Piney hops, fresh herb, citrus.  T: This is the stuff. Big hop flavor with a hint of lemon. Dominated by hops, but there's a little malt backbone there that balances this out. Bitter as hell and destroys your palate, as promised.  M: Pretty light bodied for a IIPA.

147,4083,lordofstarside,4.92,"My favorite beer. Poured from bomber to pint glass, enjoy by 12/17 date  Pours a golden copper with a mild cloud in the middle. A finger and a half of head, amazing retention and lacing down the side of the glass. Mild carbonation, a very sexy dipa  Aroma consists of hops, grapefruit, citrus and a light malt backbone. Alcohol is present, along with some earthy floral notes as well. Terrific smelling brew  Taste is foremost and upfront, hops hops hops. Grape fruit, tropical fruit, and sweet bready malts shine through. Everything is flawlessly represented and blends together perfectly.  Mouth feel is as consistent as the other elements, giving you a strong bitter sensation following a nice bitter sting, leaving the palate decimated and 'ruined.' Spikes to the roof of the mouth, extremely dry finish  Overall this beer leaves your mouth desensitized and raw, wanting more and more.

Citrus and bitter hops most present.  M...perfect amount of carbonation. Couldn't be better.  O...this really lived up to the hype.

147,4083,fmccormi,4.17,"Straight pour from 12oz pry-off bottle to a Hill Farmstead oversized wineglass. Freshness date of December 23, 2012 (“ENJOY BY 12.23.12”) printed in yellowish ink on the shoulder of the bottle above the label, so going by the 90-day freshness period that Stone uses, this was bottled just two weeks ago. Freshest bottle of Ruination I’ve ever laid my hands on, so I’m psyched!  Appearance (4.0): The body on this is crystal clear and a 24ct golden color, with a bone-white head that comes to about two fingers before dying down, leaving good lacing all around and some craters in the middle. Good looking beer, for sure.  Smell (4.5): Red grapefruit flesh and some pine needles lead the way here, without a trace of malt sweetness in the nose. The citrus character is somewhat sweet though, compensating for the plain / relatively absent malt component. Just juicy, bittersweet citrus, and a lot of it.  Taste (4.0): Lots and lots of citrus pith, just loads of grapefruit rind and some pinesap underneath—wonderfully bitter from the start to the finish, which takes a while to wind through herbal and sappy notes. There’s barely enough malt to carry the hop load, but what’s there is just plain and pale, like water crackers. Not surprisingly, not even a hint of alcohol or yeast character—true to the style.  Mouthfeel (4.5): Soft, almost lush carbonation adds some life to the body—otherwise it’d be almost painfully dry, in spite of the coating effect of the hop oils. Very drinkable.  Overall (4.0): I really do like this beer, and if it’s fresh it’s hard to beat if you’re looking for a hop fix. It’s pale, crisp, bitter as hell, and the hops linger for a long, long time. Generally I prefer IPAs to be just a bit sturdier and more dynamic, but to me this beer represents the classic West Coast-style American IPA hop bomb. Great out of the bottle, but even better on tap.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jazzyjeff13,4.3,"A 12oz bottle with a BB of Oct 2012 - fresh! Acquired from Trembling Madness in York just the other day. Looking forward to trying this famous Stone brew....  Poured into a Delirium chalice. A rich golden-sunset hue with faint haze and good carbonation. Produces a large head of creamy white foam that hangs around for a while before reducing to a surface layer. The aroma is deeply hoppy: juicy notes of pine, grapefruit, orange peel, lemon and citrus. This is underpinned by subtle hints of caramel malt and a fair whiff of alcohol. Slightly sweet.  Tastes of overwhelming hops with an intense bitterness - wow! Notes of pine, resin, grapefruit, bitter orange, lemon and citrus. Underneath the hops lie sweet caramel malt and a hint of yeast, which provide a degree of balance. Very dry and seriously bitter upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is smooth, spicy and tingly - the hop oils play havoc with the palate. Nice body and decent carbonation. Highly astringent. Aftertaste of bitter aromatic hops - plenty of lingering flavour to savour.  Tasty - a solid DIPA and possibly the best I've tried to date. The hops need no further introduction; they are the stars of the show. A lovely range of aroma hop flavours that blend together perfectly. The bitterness is powerful but never seems over the top, while the malt provides just enough sweetness to keep this brew from seeming one-dimensional. Ruination is a well-deserved title; it towers over many other IPAs. Superb - add this to your must-try list.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,s1ckboy,3.8,"A - Clear amber with 3-4 fingers of white fluffy head.  S - Piney goodness, a touch of floral/citrus, mostly pine.  T - Piney bitterness, palate wrecking for sure. Tiny bit of malt, mostly hops.  M - Bunch of carbonation.  I think I have been ruined by trying some amazing IPA's (pliny, heady, sculpin, hill farmstead stuff), this just wasn't doing it for me. Better than average but not really memorable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,tectactoe,4.21,"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours a soft yellow-amber color with a bit of opaque haziness in the middle of the glass. The slightly less-than-white head looked very foamy and stayed on top of the brew all the way down. The lacing was magnificent - truly amazing.  The nose is just as advertised - FULL of hops. Hops, pines, and hop oils crowd your nose and send your nostrils on quite a trip. A hefty dose of citrus creeps up from the back as well. Very aromatic and perfume-like, just what you expect from a top of the line IPA. Walk through a field of pine trees. Stick your nose into a rose bush.  The taste jumps up and runs a goddamn number on your palate. Hops, hops, hops, and more hops. The hops have a huge pine taste surrounding them, kind of like drinking a liquid tree. Earthy and floral flavors also come out, especially as the beer warms. Grapefruit is noticeable, as are other citrus fruits, perhaps pineapple and orange zest being the best description.  The combo of the wet and pungent citrus rinds and the oily, hoppy bitterness assault is surely a palate destroyer, but in the best way possible. The tongue is left with a bit of hop bitterness and a touch of saltiness that keeps you thirsty for more. Medium-thick body with a sticky mouth-feel. The alcohol doesn't go unnoticed, but it doesn't hinder, either; it provides a nice, solid body that ties everything together.  Probably the best tongue-scrapingly-bitter DIPA that you can get almost anywhere. If you haven't had this beer, I suggest that you try to find it. Be prepared to take a few days off from drinking after you have this one, you'll taste nothing but hops for a while.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,theHoff77,3.35,"I'm going to start off with my overall opinion saying I wasn't impressed by this considering all the praise. It lacks the wow factor in the taste department, and honestly I thought it was unpleasant. I was able to finish one, but on my second it ended up in a drain poor. My other two are going to be freebies.  A - Nice deep gold color which started with a foamy one finger head. No lacing on this.  S - Probably the strong suit of this beer and even in this category it wasn't special. Notes of hops, pine, and citrus.  T - Just wasn't as robust as advertised. It was standard IPA of hops, Pine, and Citrus. I've had cheaper IPAs with more complex flavors. This was just boozy and bland.  M - For something marked with over 100 IBUs it lacked serious kick. It's balanced and doesn't leave much for aftertaste aside of alcohol.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,GMB,5,"A perfect score is not something to be given indiscriminately. Despite attempts to be overscrupulous in my critique, despite perusing critical comments by BeerAdvocate reviewers whom I admire, I failed to find an imperfection in this hop-focused beer. Yes, in the final analysis, Ruination IPA deserves each of the five perfect scores that I gave it.  The beautiful hazy golden body of Stone Brewery's Ruination IPA supports the kind of thick, frothy head that one frequently hopes for but almost never finds. The viscosity and cling of this head are enough to put most beers to shame. Indeed, it stuck around so long that I lost hope it would ever fall. And so I pressed the glass to my lips, and took my first sip of hoppy glory.  But before I took my first sip, I made sure to take in a few a deep breaths of this beer's bouquet, which comprises floral, citrusy, piney, and resinous fragrances. The absolutely clean aroma of American floral hops (Centennial and Columbus) fills my olfactory organs. Malts are barely detectable, as they should be.  The taste of this beer is even more balanced than I expected. The American bittering and aroma hops are showcased, of course, and there is just enough malt to provide some sweetness. But the hops' aromas are not at all muddled, nor is are their bitter qualities overpowering. The flavor of this beer is not only balanced, but utterly clean. There are no indiscernible flavors here. Both the aroma and flavor of the beer make me feel as if I were sticking my nose in a sack of fresh hops and taking a few deep breaths. So fresh, so floral, so pleasing...  The hazy appearance of the beer indicated that this is an unfiltered beer. Thank goodness, because the yeast has produced a rich, buttery flavor that pairs deliciously with the hoppy bouquet. The floral tastes of alcohol become palpable as the brew warms, and pick up and accentuate the hops' floral and citrusy flavors. The beautiful pairing of floral and creamy, buttery flavors reminds me of the way that boiled fresh milk and aromatic spices (e.g., cardamom, ginger, and tea leaf) divinely complement each other in a well-made cup of chai. Like a well-made cup of chai, Stone Ruination IPA offers up each of its strong flavors both distinctly and as complements to each other. It is rare indeed to come across a beer whose flavor is at once intense, sophisticated, rich, and clean.  The viscous froth that I observed in the head reemerges each time I swirl the beer around my tongue. It's a perfect complement to the beer's buttery, rich body and flavors.  Stone tells us that ""Ruination IPA"" is so named because of its ruinous effect on the palate. I grant that the intensity of the beer's taste may ""ruin"" a few neophyte palates. But it is difficult to imagine how sophisticated beer drinkers could consider this beer's fresh, floral taste as anything but refreshing, restorative and rejuvenating.  But perhaps there is one sense in which ""ruination"" is an appropriate designation. This brew is indeed likely to ""ruin"" one's taste for other American Double- or Imperial- India Pale Ales. I have had hundreds of beers in this style. This one is a cut above the rest. First class.  Tip: First relish the hoppy glory that is Ruination IPA without accompaniments. Then, try snacking on some dried fruits as you sip the beer. Dates, dark raisins, and currants make excellent pairings.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,IKR,3.71,"Appearance: Light Amber color with a generous-sized white head that slowly faded.  Smell: Primarily Piney and grassy hop aromas. Fairly mild nose but it smells good.  Taste:The pine aromas carry over to the taste, but I also get some mild citrus notes. The finish is all hops but not overly complex.  Mouth-feel: Medium body with a medium level of carbonation.  Overall: It's not overly complex but a good hop forward beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mick303,4.27,"BB (19/04/14). Pours a good head, leaving film and good lace. Colour is a medium orange gold, slight amber. Very nice.  The smell is immediate after the bottle is poured. Indeed, as expected, a massive hop presence. But they are great, slightly herbal, slightly smoky, a bit pine character. A nice lightness, grass, pungent citrus. Tons of character, while retaining good balance. It is something to behold.  Taste has a big hop character up front, again they are very herbal, bitter, medicinal, almost antiseptic, and a note reminiscent of BBQ. The flavour is unrelenting, eventually a bit of malt tries, and cannot, hold back the onslaught of hops. It walks a delicate line, but does so excellently. Its a beast of a beer to be sure but the profile is excellent, shows really good complexity, with plenty of supporting flavour notes.  Mouthfeel is full bodied and highly bitter, carbonation is there but you cant tell much through the thick hops. Aftertaste has a good deal of dry hops, bitter and lasting.  A class act. Excellent from start to finish. Personally I would prefer more balance over the over-the-top hops. You should really be sure you're ready to handle this beer, a highly assertive IPA. Hops through the roof. But those who stick it out will enjoy an excellent D-IPA, great flavour, lasting finish, and admirable profile, just raucous enough without crossing into assaulting. Try it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,micromaniac129,4.1,"Ruination has a orange amber color and a beige really dense head. It's lingers and leaves sticky lacing. Looks to be nicely carbonated but difficult to judge due to the hazy complexion of the brew.  Aromatics prove to be quite hoppy with a floral, citrus bouquet.  Personally I didn't think it was all that hoppy. Taste is big bold and wet hops though flavor is light and having a citrus floral aspect. Malts are sweet and balance out a little the hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel of course is the bitter ending and it lingers well into the aftertaste.  Quite good and flavorful, come on, it's Stone here. Whats nice for me is the fact that the abv's are in a more tolerant area for me to handle.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,NickyPogs,3.92,"A - Had a nice deep amber/golden color with a nice head pour from the bottle.  S- Nice hoppy aroma that almost buried the malts. I did like the smell better than the taste.  T - This had a unique flavor to it. I definitely enjoyed the hop and bitterness but I tasted some citrus flavors that didn't seem to blend that well for me. Started strong but had an off after taste. I wouldn't say it was bad, just different than what I expected.  M - Not overpowering, had a good amount of flavor and feel. Well balanced but left that unique after taste.  O - I did enjoy the hops taste and would recommend it to friends who like DIPA's. It wasn't my favorite, but much better than most. May need to try from a tap to see if there is any difference.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,porntipsguzzardo,4,"Revising this review as I've grown more accustomed to hoppy beers since I first had it.  The beer pours a hazy golden-orange with a reasonable head that fades quickly, though that might be a result of the slightly greasy Thai soup I had a couple of hours ago.  It smells of citrus and pine, and tastes of apple, pine, and slight grapefruit. Not a lot to sense on the malt end, other than a very mild sweetness - it's definitely skewed toward the hop side of the flavor profile. It's good, but I still prefer more citrusy and balanced IPAs, like Pliny, Union Jack and Sculpin.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,GuyIncognito,4.47,"I can't believe it's taken me this long to try this beer. Light honey color, and a burst of hops on the nose.The first sip is hop heaven, and it keeps getting better after that. Good balance of hops, with a citrus finish. I recently had the Stone 16th Anniversary IPA, and it was lemon, lemon, lemon, and more lemon. That one was a one time release, and fortunately the Ruination is much more balanced. Not too much pine in this one, very drinkable. For the money, I would probably just get the regular Stone IPA. Have I been ruined for other IPAs? Probably not, but this is one hell of a beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ArrogantBastard203,4.8,"A- Hazy orange, slightly amber. barely any head retention.  S- Perfect bread malts, unmistakable grapefruit aromas with an overwhelmingly, pungent presence of the wonderful Hop  T-Perfect balance of grapefruit and hops right upfront. Literally an IPA bliss is achieved. A very nice malt backbone rounds this out to be, in my opinion, a perfect IPA.  MF- Not heavy, not light. Slick and oily almost but delicate and inviting.  Overall this is a beer you can never go wrong with when youre craving a hell of an IPA. Its always a choice on the back of my mind when i go to the package store.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,srandycarter,3.75,"A - Nice, fairly clear, has good head retention for a cask.  S- As expected, the hops take the show. Overwhelming. Malt is a background.

D - Very easy to drink and I think my favorite cask to date!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Philip61,4.79,"This beer is what made me want to review beers. I saw that this was highly rated so I went for it. Drank it straight out of the bottle and was glad I did. The bottle is awesome, but the beer itself is rather clear. I popped the top and bang, the hops get funneled up the neck of the bottle and directly into my face. I took one sip and started giggling, this was the best sip of beer I have ever had.  Extremely complex flavors, a hop explosion. This was just awesome. I had no idea how much I liked hops until this beer entered my life. I already have a Furious clone homebrew kit on the shelf...so its next on my list to compare.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Ommy,4.42,"Ruination pours a great light golden brown color with a white foamy head. The head lingers for quite a while leaving nice lacing.  I think I smell a tiny, itty bitty, slight note of hops.... On second thought, I smell a lot of hops. Actually, is there anything else in this beer? Oh wait! There is a bit of maltyness!  The taste is quite unlike most IPAs I have had. This one has the usual resiny hoppy taste, but it has a slightly sweet finish, which lingers and is much more pleasant than the traditional IPA finish. I get a little taste of banana on the end.  Overall this is a great beer for hop heads. I always like a hoppy beer, and a lot of IPAs have a really heavy malt characteristic that I'm not always keen on, so this is a pleasant surprise.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,bigpatvoodoodad,3.95,"Served from 22oz bottle poured into English pint glass.  A - poured a thick, foamy 3-finger white head. Has a golden hue to it. Not what I expected.  S - I can smell the malt and also a citrus. Much more malt than I expected.  T - Taste is pretty good. Again, lots of malt and of course citrusy IPA bitterness - yet the bitterness is subtle. Perhaps the strong upfront malt is subduing some of the citrus and bitterness I expect from IPA's. Not as bitter as I thought it would be considering it says on the bottle 100+ IBU'S  M - mouthfeel is sticky and oily, typical of IPA.  O - I cracked this one open after letting it chill for only a couple of hours in the fridge. It's a good beer, just not something I'm looking for in an IPA. It's a bit too malty for my liking.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,RussBecker1,4.17,"The bottle cap reads something along the lines of ""an ale on overdrive"" as was published by food and wine magazine. There might not be a better description than that as Stone's Ruination will knock you on your arse with with overblown hops and it won't quit until the very last drop. This beer is certainly not for everyone, as it will gladly blow the doors off your palate making other beers you try in a short timespan to seem utterly lifeless. That being said if hops are your thing this is one of the very best. The appearance was lackluster but everything else beats you into submission with relentless taste nose and feel. I have had ruination many times before and will many times again. It also serves as a great introductory lesson into the field of imperial IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Goblinmunkey7,4.3,"Appearance: Clear dark gold. Head pours big and fluffy and drops to a thin cap in short order. Head is bright-white, fluffy, and dense. Serious notches of lacing. Sheets even.  Smell: Big flowers and citrus. Grapefruit, orange zest, and grapefruit flesh. Some underlying pine resin. Malts are bready and subdued...as to be expected. Crazy floral. Almost like a delicious citrus perfume. Big hops, but it's not aggressive like some other DIPAs.  Taste: Pith. Bitter grapefruit rind and oily resin. Massively floral. The aftertaste of delicious hairspray. Punches of citrus. Nice malt backbone is shoved aside in favor of the hops. Mild biscuity undertones. Some lingering malt sweetness. As it warms the hops push some more earthy and herbal notes with a touch of mint. Not balanced, but also not aggressively bitter.  Mouthfeel: Medium body. Oily and slick. Nice mellow/moderate carbonation. Drinks smooth. Dry on the finish.  Overall: 10 years ago this beer was punching babies in the face. Now, it's still worth drinking.  I wasn't drinking this beer 10 years ago, but I can imagine it was so radical it blew minds. As it is, it's still a solid DIPA.

147,4083,KuehneBe,4.58,"Review from notes, had this beer about two months ago.  Appearance This is one gorgeous beer! It is a light, rich amber that refracts light beautifully. The head sticks around for a while, and leaves very nice lacing once it disappears.  Smell Unsurprisingly, the citrusy hops is the most prominent scent, but despite its massive aroma it doesn't overpower. Reminiscent of pineapple and wild honey, with lovely malt and floral aromas. Literally mouth-watering.  Taste Oh, the hopsmanity! Like a punch and a cuddle at the same time. Follows up the smell, and adds a whole new dimension of goodness. Citrusy, with a hint of pine. The malts are reminiscent of dark bread (almost pumpernickel-esque), and help make this IIPA both complex and hard to resist.  Mouthfeel Somewhat resinous, and the alcohol adds pleasant warmth. Equally powerful and refreshing, without being too sticky. Just as one would expect from an Imperial IPA.  Overall This beer deserves its reputation without the slightest doubt. Another astonishing offer from Stone that I will be sure to seek out again. Absolute top-tier, for IIPAs and beers in general.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Smell: Pine, floral and grassy hops, Some citrus and grapefruit deep in there, but this is a hop cone bomb. Light caramel / deep honey also.  Taste: Follows the nose with huge bitter pine hops. Also take on a grassy aspect. Light citrus aspects. Some caramel sweetness. Focal point here is truly ruining the palate on bitterness however.  Mouthfeel: So bitter. This crushes my palate by the end of the bottle. More ""ruining"" than the 10th anni IMO. Still goes down pretty easily.  Overall: A solid classic, and one I'll always buy, especially for the price.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Actually has enough malt flavor to help balance out all that bitterness. A little bread and caramel in the malt profile. You can definitely tell it's an Imperial IPA. It's not that the alcohol is present, it's just how big the flavor is. Really good.  Mouthfeel: This is a full bodied IPA. Good level of carbonation and slightly above average drinkability.

147,4083,hagbergl,4.7,"I enjoyed a bomber of Stone Ruination IPA on August 2, also known as ""IPA Day."" I mean, why not enjoy one of the beers most responsible for starting the Imperial IPA craze. Served this classic into a snifter. Review is from notes.  Appearance (4.5/5): Ruination has a classic IPA appearance: it has a clear copper-orange body, is topped with a 2 finger, billowy, white head of foam, and leaves a ton of lacing on the sides of the glass as it's consumed. You can se a good amount of carbonation on observing the body. This beer looks and acts like you want your IPAs to. Excellent.  Smell (4.5/5): Lots of pine and citrus smells–grapefruit and lemon especially–and some light biscuity malt peeks out from behind the massive hop smells. The smell portends great things to come.  Taste (5/5): Ruination is packed with great hop flavor: grapefruit rind, pine, and rosewater dominate the foretaste. Light biscuity and caramel malt flavors push back, balance, and add body and complexity, but are ultimately overrun by the monstrous hoppiness of the beer. A distinct lemon astringency characterizes the finish, which is very bitter, dry, and almost puckering. There is a slight hint of alcohol heat in the finish as well.  Mouthfeel (4.5/5): Ruination is medium bodied and possesses a medium level of carbonation, has a slightly resinous and prickly feel, and is drying in the finish. The mouthfeel is right where it should be for an Imperial IPA.  Overall (4.5/5): Ruination is a great Imperial IPA. It's no longer the cool, new kid on the block, but it could teach today's new kids a lot. One thing I really appreciate about it is that it keeps the alcohol levels in check and avoids the ""syrup curse"" that overly hot, sweet, Imperial IPAs exhibit; these bad apples resemble American barleywines in their flavor more than IPAs. Ruination, on the other hand, is beautifully hopped, highly bitter, and pleasingly dry. She's a beauty.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,Lemke10,4.75,"I got a 22oz bottle of this from Woodman’s in Rockford, Il for $5.99 in early 2012. Pours a clear amber color with a fluffy off-white head. Scent is full of hops mices with some citrus. Mmmm holy hops Batman. The taste is loaded with smooth, crisp hops that gang-bang your taste buds. Texture is smooth and refreshing. Slight dry, chalky finish. Really lives up to its name!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,rodlavers,4.25,"Poured from bomber into perfect pint glass. Frothy fluffy off white head. Some cling as retention. Light copper amber coloring. Smell is caramel and malt hops. Bready elements present, with some sweetness. Taste is sweet and creamy, with caramel and malt most prominent. There is a floral presence as well, with some resin. Mouthfeel is smooth. Good beer, less complicated but delicious.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,tobelerone,4.03,"On-tap. Lightly hazed orange color, two fingers of foamy white head settling slowly; nice creamy lacing remains. Nose is assertively hoppy; malt and subtle caramel sweetness are present but firmly in the background; lots of citrus, orange, grapefruit, pineapple; some floral notes.  The taste is certainly aggressively hopped as well but the grapefruit-y bitterness is counterbalanced a bit by a stronger, sweeter malt character. Again there is an array of hop flavors with various citrus fruits and floral and pine notes. Dries up pretty well in the finish; the bitterness remains during a lengthy aftertaste.  Medium to slightly full bodied, medium carbonation; a little smooth and sticky. Typical of the old guard of this style.  This is certainly a classic DIPA but no longer a top favorite of mine. It’s big and bitterly hoppy and a bit boozy and yes, maltier than I might like. Not the most subtle or intricate DIPA; something like Pliny (to say nothing of Hill Farmstead or Alpine IPAs) has this beat on overall flavor, complexity, and drinkability.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Oakenator,4.95,Excellent double IPA. Pours mostly golden with a hint of orange coloring. Smells like a bouquet of hops. Taste is out of this world with hops all over but becoming sweet especially as the beer warms beyond usual fridge temperatures. Overall one of the best beers I've tasted and definitely earns its rights as a benchmark for double IPAs.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,fields336,4.12,"22 oz bottle best by 7/9/12 little past the date but close enough  A: light orange, dark gold, nice 1-2 finger fluffy white/off white head, some chill haze present. Head hangs around and lacing is nice  S: pineapple, mango, floral, earthy, sweet caramel  T: sweet malt upfront then a wave of bitter fruity hops, pineapple, mango, floral. nice and stout bitterness, but very tasty.  M: light-Medium bodied, with ok carbonation, perhaps a component of the lack of freshness.  *Reported this to stone, hopefully we can get some fresh new bottles soon",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,SolipsismalCat,4.28,"Poured into a pint glass.  A: Hazy light orange with a one-finger, white, foamy head that lasted more than several minutes. Very nice lacing.  S: Floral hops and sweet malt. Tropical aromas linger.  T: Light sweetness with a solid hop bitterness. Floral hops with a pronounced bitterness. Light toast.  M: Medium bodied with light carbonation. Smooth and dry.  O: This is a really good imperial IPA. Beautiful to look at with a wonderful, strong aroma.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Kisejohn,4.92,"Aroma:  Intense piney, spicy, floral hop aroma.  Appearance:  amber to orange in color.  Two fingers of head.  Nice lacing.  Flavor:  Starts sweet, proceeds to aggressive piney, floral hops balanced by malt sweetness.  Finishes with a sweet, with bitterness that lingers.  A masterfully crafted west coast IPA.  Slight astringency noted.  Mouthfeel:  Medium bodied.  some syrupy characteristics present.  Overall:  Aggressively hopped, masterfully balanced IPA fitting of the Stone name.  A roller coaster of flavors that dazzles the senses.  Highly recommended. ",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,TubaManJack,4.3,"Procured a single 12 oz for $3.50 in Delaware - one of the better single bottles that I have picked up on a whim.  Appearance: A pint glass pour yields a great hazed golden orange body. The carbonation is fairly evident as it it blossoms into a great head. Not much retention here folks as it fades into a bit of lacing.  Smell: Strong nose of the deeper darker hop and malt combination. I don't get the same citius as much as a blend of pine/resin hops and malt mix.  Taste: This beer is a bit like a hop tar bomb. The amount of resin is a bit much, bit in keeping with the name its all in balance. It is much like a large lineman trying to get on to Metro. The malt adds a whole layer of body and slight sweetness that I rarely encounter in DIPAs.  Overall its not my favorite big dark IPA but it is one of the most balanced that I have enjoyed. Its worth the try and a nice benchmark for what a Fall Style should be.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,MagicJeff,4.5,"Wow. Can't believe I hadn't gotten around to reviewing this one. Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter.  Appearance: Light almost golden copper. Decent finger head recedes to about an 8th of an inch. Nice Lacing afterwards.  Smell: Biscuity with pineapple/tropical scent. The caramel from the malt plays well with all of the hops that are prevalent.  Taste: This is where the beer wins me over. Unbelievably complex. The IBU's are off the charts, yet it is balanced so well to make up for it. It may sound intimidating (especially after reading the wordy label), but it is so worth a try. By no means a hop bomb. Taste a lot of pineapple and tropical citrusy fruits.  Mouthfeel: Very crisp, clean finish. Won't say this is a session brew, but still very drinkable.  Overall: Can easily say this is one of the best IPA's I've ever had. I mentioned the wordy label, yet the beer and brewery do not come off as pretentious--if anything, one sees the passion and pride that they put into each beer that they make. Extremely enjoyable and highly recommended! Wish they would've released more of the 10th anniversary in GA though.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Jesse13713,3.76,"Poured into a Wittekerke 1/2 liter pilsner to mix things up a bit. Just had Ruination tenth two days ago, so I'm eager to to see how this compares. I have had this before, but it's been awhile.  Appearance - A lightly transparent hoppy orange. Bustling with carbonation. One finger of lightly creamy head. A very caramelized look to it. Very nice lacing.  Smell - Extremely piney. Fresh, complex hops. Very faint caramel malt. A bit on the weaker side.  Taste - Very piney hops with orange, lemon, mango and citrus notes. A nice alcoholic burn among a forest of flavors. The malt in the background is extremely faint and hardly offers any sweetness.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability - Extremely bitter due to the piney hops. Not nearly as sweet as Ruination tenth anniversary. Much less of a malt back to it as well.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,angrybabboon,4.36,"Consumed 7/4/12  Appearance: Pours very clear, golden orange - nicely sized white head, fades to some spots and streaks  Smell: Hoppy as promised - citrus and pine in abundance - orange and grapefruit, some flesh and a lot of rind, pith, with some floral notes - sharp, sticky pine resin and some herbal notes - just a touch of green onion - some pale and vaguely caramel malts buried in the background  Taste: Hoppy and remarkably bitter - orange and grapefruit rind, with some juicy citrus flesh and some pith - straight-up hop resin, some dry pine, and a touch of mint - floral and herbal notes - very, very bitter, even for the style, but not abrasive - some pale malts function as a base, but this beer certainly in not about balance  Mouthfeel: Medium body, nicely dry, smooth, nicely carbonated - light for the style, but it's so drinkable that it gets bonus points  Overall: More than a benchmark for the style  I had this about 3 years ago, and I honestly couldn't comprehend it. Now that I better understand the glory of a well-done DIPA, I am somewhat blown away that I wasn't blown away by this beer in the past. Ruination is fantastic, and I am sad that I haven't had it in years. It's incredibly hoppy and dry, not sweet. In other words, this is what I want in my life.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,threeviews,4.96,"Poured from a 22oz bottle (Best Before date: 08-06-12) into a long stemmed, 12oz tulip glass  A- Pours a very clear golden yellow/orange with about a 1-1/2 finger of white, frothy head with minimal lacing.  S- Oh, glorious hops - sweet, sugar coated citrus (tangerine, orange and grapefruit) along with fleshy, tropical fruit (peach, mango, and pineapple) mingle with copious amounts of pine resin....wow!  T- Sweet tropical fruit is met with a blast of white grapefruit rind bitterness. It is with this last dose of hop bitterness that I can surmise where the name of the beer is derived. However, the hop astringency is supported (but not dominated) by the malt backbone.  M- Ample, but not overwhelming carbonation is provided by THE very, very transparent Chico ale yeast. Perfect.  O- What is there left to document that hasn't already been stated? Ruination IPA has set the standard for an entire wave of IPA's (specifically, Imperial IPA's) flooding the American craft beer market. Although it might seem 'pedestrian' at this juncture, Ruinaition IPA is a testament to Stone's influence in the US craft brewing industry and are confirmed trendsetters. Ruination IPA still ranks with high marks as one of the beers which defined the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Maxwell,4.29,"I love the bottle. The cool texture of the golden paint is awesome, the mean looking horned gargoyle gives the beer a nice medieval feel. The disambiguation and description on the back are awesome and also painted on to the bottle which makes it look even more Neo-Medieval. The green text announcing the beers name is a little out of place and the font seems slightly off, but over all this is a cool bottle. I also like nice “Victorian Demonic” feel of the bottle and the description on the back. The golden lettering on the back of the bottle is awesome and very cool to look at.  The beer pours a nice yellowed orange, very much like dehydrated piss, and even the head is slightly yellow, but thick and bubbly, with not a very long retention. Lacing is thick and peaked like a mountain range. The smell is a stupendous kerpow of hops; very piney with slight hints of citrus and not a lot else. The pine hops are very much the dominator in the smell. There might be a slight sweet malt at the end of the smell, but that might just be me stretching to smell. This is just a big bitter punch in the face. This beer is just pine hops blasting over your tongue, but they are great. After taste is like a pine forest bristling in the wind. There is, again, an ever so slight taste of sweet maltiness to it. Mouthfeel is very crisp and smooth. Carbonation doesn’t seem to touch the tongue much but the bitterness of the hops is very present on the tongue, and the top of the tongue is left rather dry, but still sticky on the sides with saliva. The overall after-feel in the mouth is bitter. This is a beer that demonstrates the bitters, but not much else. The bottle claims to have great subtle tastes of yeast and malts, but I would say that the real strength and the only true flavor is in the deep piney hops. I don’t know if I would have this one again. I love a good IPA and a good bitter taste but this just seems to be straight pine and nothing else. It’s a great example of the pine flavor but I don’t know how much of the pine flavor I would personally like to drink. The beer is similar to Longhammer IPA by Redhook Brewery, only with more hops and bite and a better smell.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,MortarPestle,4.33,"Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow with a nice frothy head that dissipates quickly.  Aroma: Hops are front and center; citrus and a touch of fruit and spice.  Taste: The bottle claims that the hops will have a ""ruinous"" effect on your palate, and although there is a lot of hop flavor I didn't find that it deadened my taste-buds. Lots of citrus, earthy, spicy and floral notes. The malt adds a fruited bread balance,  Texture: Dry and crisp with warming effect of alcohol.  Drinkability: I had this on my want list for some time and I am glad I tried it. I prefer the balance found in the Levitation Ale.

GLORIOUS. very VERY hoppy but still balanced in an amazing way...pours golden yellow with slight haziness and reeks of bitter/sweet hops. immediate shock to the palate with an overabundance of hoppiness yet still as i said perfectly balanced... i cant come close to describing how great this beer is so just TRY IT 4 YOURSELF!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The head dissipates very slowly, leaving lacing on the side of the glass. The aroma is of citrus and resinous pine. The malt also comes through in the aroma. This is such a hop forward smell. The hop forward nose gives way towards a very hop forward taste. The big piney hops lead into the citrus and sweet malt tastes. The hops are lovely and this beer is well balanced. The body is medium to full with adequate carbonation. The beer is sticky in the mouth. The drinkability is high. This is a well-balanced beer that definitely fits the world class label. Well done, Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jkanavel,3.98,"A: Amber, golden, clean white pillow-cloud head.  S: Dankety Dank. The Dankest bag of dank you ever stuck your nose into. Hands down the best part about the beer. The earthy DANK gives way to lime and grapefruit around the edges of the glass. No idea what kind of hops were used in this, but I'd guess there is some Columbus in there. THere is a back note of soap, like Dawn soap, but I guess they use a lot of citrus scents, so maybe thats just what I equate it with.  T: Pretty damn good. In 2012, not that revelatory. Big bitterness around the sides of the tongue. Kind of an numbing effect, as well as a spiciness. The aromatic component to this beer just lifts it up and separates it from the rest of the super IPA's out there. Some sweetness, but very light, not heavy or fruity at all. Fairly dry, but balanced. Not bone dry.  M: Medium bodied. Very well carbonated. Smooth.  O: Rad.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

T: Taste is almost exactly like the nose, piney, grassy citrusy, all mixed together for a perfect blend of greatness, amazing taste.

A: Almost identical hazy golden as Stone IPA with a short cap of almost white head with a collar of lace at the top of the glass.  S: Aroma is not as strong or as varied with mainly pine and pineapple/lemon fruit aromas and no malt component to speak of.  T: The flavor is very bitter but still somewhat well balanced with a huge dose of pale maltiness and a bracing hop barrage of pineapple, orange, lemon, and pine.  M: Despite the bitterness this is smooth and easy to consume with a body that is much lighter than the flavor with good dryness to improve consumability.

This is what beer should look like.  S: Holy hops. Lots of nice piney/citrusy hop aromas. Catching some sweet dark fruit flavors but they are masked pretty well by the hops.  T: Very enjoyable, especially for the Non-Hop-Head-Malt-Lover. Starts off with some malty sweetness with some nice fruit esters, maybe apple and pear, and then goes right to that piney/citrus hops flavor. Its almost like drinking a nice malt brew with a pine branch with orange bitters wrapped around it under ur nose the entire time. Alcohol flavors is there as well but not overpowering and seems to work well with the malty sweetness and hops flavors. Aftertaste is bitter and lingers but not excessively.  M: Mild carbonation, your left with a creaminess on your palette as opposed to the expected dryness from the high ABV.  O: Despite the 100+ IBU rating, I was very surprised by the lack of bitterness. Don't get me wrong, its def there but the maltyness, mild fruit flavors and alcohol taste really balance this out well.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The smell is lemon, citrus, grapefruit and flowery hops. Tasting the beer, there is an explosion of citrus fruity tastes. Those are kept in check by a malt presence in the middle, and being finished with more hops in the end. Greatly balanced beer. Exeptional!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,NWer,4.32,Pours clear light yellow. Off-white head. Light citrus aroma. Taste takes off. Much better. Full citrus. Grapefruit. Lemon rind that explodes in the palate and lingers.

147,4083,estlinska,4.95,"From a bottle into a tulip glass. I've only lived in places where Stone is not distributed, so these are true treats for me. Pours a slightly hazy orange color with two fingers of white, frothy head. The head lingers for eons and leaves beautiful lacing on the glass like strings of cob web. The aroma is all hops, sticky with citrus grapefruit and resin. Hiding in the nose is a waft of honey sweetness. The first taste is a blossom of pure hops; the heavy flavor is all citrus hops with a backbone of pine. It blends beautifully into that promise of honeysuckle like sweetness I found on the nose. The sweetness on the back end coupled with the unapologetic hop smack in the mouth makes this THE IPA against which I compare all others. This is the beer that turned me into a beer geek. Other IPAs are guilty of just loading you with hops for hops sake, but this beer uses them the way they are meant to be used.

A - deep golden color with a brilliant, sticky inch of white foam on top that does a great job of sticking to the glass after a swirl.  S - awesome! Grapefruit and floral hops were noticeable the second I popped the cap. A truly fantastic barrage of citrus, fruity hops all the way through.  T - as the nose indicated, this is a hop bomb! But not as palate-wrecking as one might think. A ton of hops but enough malt to smooth it out. Fantastic.  M - creamy, crisp, a nice body.

Very light and floral with some good sweetness.  T: I think this was the good IPA I had been craving. Seems very balanced with a good amount of hops but some good sweetness. The flavors fade to a good bitterness that goes away slowly but pleasantly.  M: Full body and super creamy. This is really the shining point of this beer and is without a doubt one of the smoothest beers I've ever had.  Overall very good indeed.

147,4083,Lawl3ss,3.83,"Chilled 12 oz bottle. ""Best by"" date 5.6.12. Yeah, this one's had some time to mellow out. I've had it fresh a number of times, so I figured I'd set one aside and see what happens.  Look- Medium amber, light haze. Three fingers of foamy off-white head, insane retention. Leaves sticky-looking rings of lace. Very nice.  Smell- Strong pine aroma, light citrus, mild sweetness. Swirling brings out a sweet earthy aroma. Pretty subdued, but quite pleasant.  Taste- Like the nose, pretty subdued compared to the fresher offering. Crackerlike malt makes it's presence felt, most of the bitterness is at the back end of the sip. Strong herbal character throughout. Hints of tangerine come and go. Bitterness builds as the brew goes down, rather than the immediate hop wash I recall.  Mouthfeel- Medium body, medium carb. Moderate dryness, coating, somewhat oily.  Overall- Trust the brewers. I've enjoyed a number of DIPAs well past their ""expiration"" dates, and enjoyed most of them. Ruination is still a decent beer, but loses much more than it gains. The brewer's intent being a hop-slap to the face, that's perfectly reasonable, but drink it when you buy it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,celfan,4.81,"OK. I'm not a real hophead. I used to be an anti-hops guy until I was turned on to Double IPA's that offset the bitterness with citrus juice. I mainly drink IPA's made here in Vermont that tend t be on the citrusy side (Heady, Hill Farmstead and Lawsons). I actually went to the liquor store to get some Lawson's Double Sunshine and they were out. Figured I'd give this a try. Wow!. Super hoppy but balanced so nicely that I wasn't overwhelmed. Great head and carbonation level. A little clearer appearance than I like but no big deal. The key word here is balance. If I could change one thing it would be the super strong hop flower aftertaste, but I realize this beer is made for the fullblown hophead and will rate accordingly.

Appearence: light translucent caramel; thick head diminishes about as quickly as you'd expect from a beer with similar gravity, but leaves some nice lacing (more than I was expecting)  Smell: very prominent tangerine-y scent; very sweet--almost too much so for my nose, but my ultiamate verdict on beer in based on much mroe taste than smell; maybe a faint hint of vanilla?; mellow-spicey note that reminds me of sage more than it does anything else; the booze smell isn't nearly as pronounced as you'd expected given the ABV  Taste: alchol not nearly prominent as most other beers at this ABV; bitterness isn't as pronounced as i'd expected it to be, nor is the sweetness; you get a good amount of citrus, but I can't ascertain exactly which fruit it reminds me of--grapefruit maybe?; pine-y note as well  Mouthfeel: coats the mouth nicely; the pine notes come through as the beer is going down and linger for a bit after your sip; goes down easily for 7.7%  Overall: incredibly drinkable beer that is much more session-able than I thought it would be; I'm a bit of a hop head and was expected a bit more of a punch, but this was still a delicious beer that I'll buy again; I let the bomber sit out and re-poured as I finished each glass, and as the brew warmed it opened up quite a bit--for my next tasting (I bought two bottles), I'll let it come to room temperature before the first pour",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Plenty of visible carbonation and light curtains of lace.  S: Grapefruit and citrus hops are powerful, as well as pine. There is a faint but sweet caramel malt in the background.  T: Bitter grapefruit blends with strong pine and floral hops and alcohol to make one bitter experience. As I savor, a grassy bitterness develops which forms a dry sort of bitterness I can really feel on my tongue. A hint of toffee in the background. The finish is fairly clean for such a bitter, hop forward beer, but there is some lingering pine and alcohol.  M: Moderate to thin, but fairly slick and oily. Not too much carbonation but it feels fairly effervescent.  O: Pretty much a palate scorcher. Bitter pine, grass and floral hops just coat your tongue.

Citrus, floral, pine, earthy, spicy. One of the nicest bouquets you could ask for. Still some maltiness in the background and a hint of alcohol.  T: A blast of citrus and floral hops, leveling out to an earthy whole cone taste that compliments the malt backbone. Alcohol is present. Some of the other great double IPA's have a much cleaner hop taste.  M: Light to medium bodied, nectar like qualities, not overly sticky as some hoppy beers are. Has a warming feel.

147,4083,mscudder,4.42,"Been wanting to give this beer a whirl for some time now! Poured into a globe.  A - Cloudy orange-yellow with a pleasant warm hue. Carries a fair sized white head. Good retention.  S - Orange, grapefruit, and a pinch of mango. All of these hops are tied together by a subtle floral notes.  T - This exploded on my palette with an overwhelming amount of hops! Lots of citrus fruits, following the nose, alongside an almost oily collection of hops. Bitterness is well tamed and the overall progression is top notch.  M - Medium bodied with a fair amount of malts forming a backbone. The carbonation is perfect for the style.  O - A hoppy upgrade from the traditional Stone IPA. I feel as if they just turned up the hops a few notches and balanced accordingly. I feel there are better IPA's out there, but this is certainly one worth seeking.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,IronLover,4.38,"Golden yellow in color with an orange hue and good clarity. Poured with a thick, dense white foam with good staying power. The thick foam slowly reduces to a soapy cap that leaves sticky lacings on the glass. Pungent citrus orange and grapefruit hop aromas with pine hops and sweet sticky malt underneath. Smooth oily feel that rides over the rich lazy carbonation beneath. Fairly balanced citrus hop and caramel flavor up front. Pungent orange and grapefruit hop flavors intensify into the middle that slowly transition to bitter pine hop flavors at the end. Finishes semi-dry with a bready/malty aftertaste at first that slowly gives way to a long lasting bitter pine hoppiness.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,TheMultiYeast,4.59,"Pours clear burnt yellow with a bit of white head..loads of lacing.  As soon as i popped the cap i could smell this beer. Big fruity citrus, big pine notes, juicy tropics, peaches, cotton candy sweetness working with biscuity malts. Nice.  Incredibly smooth and hoppy. More fruitiness and oily hops. Tangy citrus. Subdued bitterness. So hoppy but so balanced..one of a kind.  Smacking, slightly prickly, smooth and dry.  Fantastic stuff here.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Danny1217,4.33,"Found a well priced six pack of this while near San Diego  The beer pours light orange color with a nice, thick white head. Retention is pretty decent  The aroma is wonderfully complex. Lots of floral and citrus scents. The hop scent reminds me of why I love IPAs.  The taste is very balanced. The hop flavor is strong as expected, but it manages to be one of the smoothest IPAs I've had.  A somewhat viscous mouthfeel with a good amount of carbonation.  Very similar to the regular IPA from Stone (which I drink on the regular basis), with more of a kick to it. This beer is among the best of its style",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,FlemingVSKing,4.85,"If you don't enjoy a good hoppy character, this beer will not be a 5 to you.  But if you are a hop fan, this is the pinnacle of the IPA craft.  You begin by looking at a golden and lightly cloudy brew that has the appearance similar to a German hoffweizen.  The aroma is not immediately overpowering, but it is clearly full of strong and various hops. I wasn't sure how to place the aroma until after tasting, but I realize now that I was enjoying the mixture of several different varieties, from fruity to bitter.  The taste is smooth. I was expecting something to immediately knock me back, but the brew begins with a very acceptable but intensely strong bitter hop that is made so by a balance of darker flavors within the beer. Those background notes don't intrude on the hop characters, but serve to embolden the entire recipe.  Next comes a very enjoyable floral hop note, which I wasn't expecting. I was expecting extreme bitterness throughout and this was a pleasant surprise.  Finally the beer finishes on a more fruity hop character with a more apparent flash of the darker background flavors. A solid finish that leaves you refreshed and wanting more.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S - Strong hoppy aroma: pine, grass, citrus. Some nice honey sweetness at the back. A really complex and pleasant blend!  T - Taste is similar to smell. Hop flavors are amazing. Herbal, grassy, almost medicinal flavors dominate but, at the same time, some toasted malt help at the balance of the beer.  M - Very smooth feeling with a perfect carbonation and a semi-dry finish. Despite the high IBU, the bitterness is not overpowering as the name might suggests.  O - One of the most amazing IPA I've ever tried!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Wonderful bouquet of pine and citrus hops. Largely citrus, though with tons of grapefruit along with some orange thrown in. Some light biscuit undertones but hops by far dominate.  The flavor is tons of citrus with some wood underneath along with a bit of caramel. A strong bitterness takes hold right away but doesn't completely drown out all of the other flavors. Alcohol is slightly noticeable at the end but this is extremely drinkable for being almost 8%.

The flavor is very bitter with the same citrus, earhty hop flavor as detected in the nose. ""Ruinous effect on the palette"" according to the bottle is right. Dominates. Sweet caramel malt base but not even close to the hop bitterness and flavor. A hint of the alcohol warmth. Full bodied and well carbonated.

147,4083,CrazyP,3.88,"A - Poured from a bottle. Pale orange color with a one finger thick head that diminished fairly quickly.  S - Primarily citrusy hops, some pine. I think this bottle might be a little on the old side (I live on the east coast) as the aroma is pretty subdued compared to other IPAs I've had in this class. Still very nice though.  T - Smooth bitterness with some honey-like sweetness (probably from honey malt).  M - Mild body and pretty dry. Very smooth drinking.

S - Pungent hops that almost give me a leather smell, overlapping with something honey sweet and breadlike, which I wasn't expecting in a hop bomb. Towards the end I almost got something soaplike, but not in a bad way. The aroma promises to pound you.  T - I was expecting my tongue to get obliterated but this is really nice and not all that bitter, period, much less for 100 IBU. No idea how old it is though, so the hops could have faded. There's definitely still an IPA bitterness there but it's pretty manageable and nice. And while it definitely lingers in the aftertaste, it's not as sharp and invasive as many. My taster may be off its game today, though, because I'm not picking out the component flavors beyond the same things going on in the nose. It seems to be more sensations than flavors, or else the hops just make it hard to parse the rest of it. Whatever it is, it's really nice.

147,4083,JimmyTango,4.25,"Appearance: Hazy yellow to orange fade with off white big ‘ol sticky head.  Smell: Sooo hoppy. Pine trees and verbena soap. Malt? Nope, just luscious, overpowering hops. This must be a f***ing fresh bottle.  Taste: Peppery, pineapple, soapy, bitter, more bitter. Some pine, but I can’t really say anything besides hoppy. Hoppy like hop extract. Herby? Fruity? Piney? Weed? Somewhere in there there is a bit of a bread dough taste, but just subtly enough to help secretly up the bitchin-ness.  Mouth feel: Prickly, and a little sticky. Light to med bodied—Just fine for an IPA like this.  Overall: Don’t know how I missed this last time I had it. I love it. Maybe I got luck this time around and it really is just another IPA like I used to think. This is a super duper unbalanced hoppy beer without anything to distract you from the squeaky clean hop flavors. Serves a purpose.-",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Darkmagus82,4.2,"Poured from bottle into pint glass  Appearance – Pours an orange-yellow color with a big white head and a nice haziness. The head fades moderately fast and leaves a lighter amount of lacing.  Smell – Citrus hops are the heaviest with a little bit of sweeter orange and bread aroma as well. These two are the dominant aromas, but there is a lighter pine and floral hop mixed into the nose as well.  Taste –For a brew that is touted by the brewers to “have ruinous effects on the palate”, due to the bitterness, I found this brew to have transitions in the taste are very smooth and quite wonderful. A sweeter malty base is the first to meet the tongue; it is of bread and caramel. A sweeter fruit taste then comes in as a good dose of citrus hop comes on the scene. The citrus sweet is mainly orange and the hop is of grapefruit nature. The citrus hop flavor intensifies as the taste advances further and some lighter pine hop flavors become evident. These hops take the taste to the end. The pine dissipates a bit though and a lemon and grapefruit hop flavor are left on the; leaves a souring bitterness on the tongue which is actually is quite nice.  Mouthfeel – The body is a bit on the creamier side with a medium level of carbonation. The body matches the taste transitions quite nicely-both very smooth. The creaminess also is great for the flavors and really lets them sit on the tongue. Very nice.  Overall – Smooth. That is the best way to characterize the beer. Even with its potent IBU content it has some nice transitions and is very drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Tasty but not quite as intense as I expected given the intensity nose. M: Extremely crisp, extremely drinkable. O: A fine beer.

The smell is absolutely amazing and makes you crave the taste that awaits you. Not overpowering. Just right.  Taste: This is the best tasting beer I've ever had. Period. The zest hits you right away and the pine, citrus, raspberry flavor makes it a refreshing beer that you will want to savor. The hops are extremely refreshing. Some spice and bitterness at the end. The aftertaste isn't overwhelming. I really don't see this as a ""homp bomb"" at all. It's perfectly balanced. The tastiest beer I've had to date. Not nearly as bitter as advertised.  Feel: Sharp, sweet and refreshing. Goes down easy for a beer that you expect to bomb your palate.  Overall: What else can I say? This is top shelf.

Just a huge, dank, resinious, piney smell overpower at first, but on closer inspection, you get some very nice, though subtle floral tones in the background.  Taste: Mimics the smell quite well, but with the added bonus of the rich malty backbone that is barley perceptible under the assault of the hops, though is a much enjoyed respite.  Mouthfeel: Nice and crisp, medium bodied ale, that is drinkable for days, though that would not be advisable.

147,4083,rickyleepotts,4.19,"A few weeks ago, Jake asked me, “Have you ever had the Stone Ruination IPA?” I hadn’t. So I went to the liquor store and bought a bottle. I got home to find there was already a bottle in the fridge! It was one of our 1001 bottles. So I opened that one, and stuck the one I bought in the fridge for a later date. That date… that is today! So let’s focus is on what this hop-filled beer has to offer.  In the Glass: In the glass, it is hazy and has a typical wheat look to it. Most IPAs that I drink are fairly clear, where you can see the bubbles rushing to the top. Last night I had a double IPA that was like that. It has a thick white head, but a thin fading lace. The head makes me think this beer will have a ton of flavor and a good mouthfeel.  Nose: This smells like a bag of hops. I LOVE a good hoppy beer, and this one promises to deliver. The hops are just unreal, and there is a subtle floral note peaking through there. But the hops are just overwhelming on the nose. I like it!  Flavor: This is a GREAT beer. I love a good IPA, but when you make it a double… bottoms up. I sometimes like the overwhelming hop flavors, but this beer doesn’t have that. There are more hops on the nose than on the palate. It is cool, calm, and collected and that makes this double IPA drinkable. Almost too drinkable. The flavor doesn’t really hit your tongue until you have swallowed, but you get a bunch of flavors on the back of the palate as well.  Mouthfeel: There isn’t much mouthfeel at first, then you get hit with what feels like bubbles from the carbonation. I think that is just the thick creamy head that I was talking about earlier. Then, as you swallow, the flavors start to become pronounced and you begin to experience the imperial IPA piece of this beer. This isn’t your average double IPA. The recipe they used has a cool story, and I just love the way this beer slides down the throat. It’s not a typical IPA, but it doesn’t need to be!  Aftertaste: The aftertaste takes a few seconds to kick in, but when it does… I welcome it. The dryness from the hops kicks things off, and then you get a smooth almost bittersweet taste that settles on the back of the throat. There is a little heat too, which is weird since this beer only has a 7.7% ABV. But maybe the heat is coming from something else. The aftertaste doesn’t last long, but the burn brings all of those flavors (especially the hops) back to the surface.  This is a good beer, available in bombers, and is readily available all over the Midwest. Stone has done it again! Bottoms up, people!  Stone Ruination IPA - The bottle says: “Ruination - The act of ruining or the condition of being rued; a severe state of damage; destruction achieved by wrecking”  “Stone Ruination IPA. So called because of the immediate ruinous effect on your palate. The moment after the first swallow, all other food and drink items suddenly become substantially more bland then they were just seconds before. By the time you develop a taste for this IPA, you may find that you are permanently ruined from being able to enjoy lesser brews. Good. We freely admit to doing this. On purpose even! People are sometimes crazy enough to thank us for this assault. To which we reply, “You’re welcome.”  “Out of the smoldering ashes of the Stone Anniversary IPAs, the Ruination IPA is born. Rising like the phoenix comes this over-hopped jewel, bringing with it not the acrid sting of smoldering embers, but the abundantly pungent aroma of hops. Bountiful hops. Glorious hops. If you are not already a confirmed hop head; if you have not already converted your palate to the glory of righteous joy that the miraculous little green flower brings to the senses, then this is NOT the place to start, for it will bring you nothing but shock. All its richly layered subtleties will be for naught. Intense hop character will only be perceived as binding and blinding bitterness. Does the experienced hop lover perceive this in a different way? Well, yes and no. The matriculated imbiber is not numb to the rambunctious rich of bitterness - indeed that is a major element of the allure - however they are also able to look beyond to the well spoken yet understated male presence. The aromatic alcohol tones. The swirling meld of naturally occurring complex flavor compounds courtesy of our little friends known as “brewers yeast cells”.

T- Taste is smack you in the face hops. Definitely a true West Coast style IPA. A bit of malt to hold the hops at bay, but not much.  M- Mouthfeel is nice and dry. Not sickly sweet like some DIPAs tend to be.  O- One of my favorite beers of all times. I have only bought one case in ten years and this was it a few years back.

147,4083,doucmehu,4.18,"Poured from 22oz. Purchased in Pasadena a week ago. I drink alone. Had this one several times before, finally reviewing.  A: Pours a beautiful, slightly hazy golden straw color with a full, fluffy white head. Lacing is minimal, but a very good-looking beer nonetheless.  S: Big blast of resinous pine, mango, unripe peach, some vegetal hops. Malt is only present upon searching for it, with a slightly sweet toffee note.  T: Follows the nose well, but with the vegetal hops slightly more prominent. You can definitely taste the 100+IBU on this beer, the battering hops are potent and plenty. Again, the malts are very subdued and hardly present.   M: Clean and sharp, the hops bite into the tongue fiercely. There is no denying the intent with this beer, it is in-your-face hops from start to finish. Bitterness is substantial, however not overwhelming, despite the high IBU. Alcohol is virtually nonexistent.  O: This is the epitome of a west coast IPA in it's clean but brutal hop assault. A very well made, clean and powerful IPA that is not for those new to the style or craft. I am impressed that Stone can make this beer on such a grand scale and still have it present so well.

It’s a live ale. The color is medium amber  The aroma is one of light/medium floral piney hops, bitter and lemon, followed by medium rich roasted grain malt and ale yeast. Refined.  Crisp, bitter entry on the palate of medium distinct piney and resiny hops, followed by rather light to medium malt. The malt does have a nice richness and is quite elegant. Some light ale yeast. Medium crisp acidity with a full body and fine balanced carbonation, along with the off dry sweetness makes for a balanced brew  Long finish of mildly bitter hops and some light malt, lasts.  I have had this on tap and in bottle with similar taste profiles. Don’t know if I am just getting poorly handled beer or what but I just don’t see anything about this ale to get excited about.

Head deflates leaving a nice center crown and good lacing.  Nose is citrus fruit hops with a slight biscuit like malt scent and some honey.  First thing I taste is the grapefruit hop tartness that blends with some mild sweetness but hops is the dominant product here from start to finish.

Settles to clumps of large bubbles and a ring. A few swaths of lacing left in the glass.  Aroma of danky pine, citrus, and some sulphuric onion. Earthy floral-ness. Plenty of caramel malt backs things up. Only the slightest hint of alcohol.  Initial flavor is of grapefruit and pepper, along with the pine. Sweet malt emerges in the middle with tons of hop bitterness riding on top. Things dry up in the finish with a long lingering bitterness in the aftertaste. I don't taste the alcohol until well into the aftertaste.  Medium-full bodied with medium carbonation. Dry finish makes you want to sip again and again.

I mean a lot of orange peel. like i might need a toothpick when im done. this is a hop bomb. thats not a bad thing for hop lovers, but if you dont like hops, this would totally turn you off. I love hops, so its a total treat for me. I taste some pine on the sides of my tounge and a little bit between sips. I dont taste it as a main flavor.(Later) As it warms, additional flavors are creeping in. there is now a slight bit of butterscotch on the nose and finish. also a hint of vanilla and bread  M- Very smooth with little carbonation bite.

Some bready malts are somewhere in the background. Smells great.  Light cracker malts with some honey sweetness. Immediately crushed by hops, with flavors of lemon citrus, wildflowers, spice and pine. Peppery, slightly solventy alcohol on the end. Finish showcases a long and lingering bitterness.

Almost looks like when the beer is close to freezing film, but this one isn't too cold.  I get resin and piney aromas. I get yeasty fruity aromas too.  Taste is bright, resiny hops! Not much malt, but enough to level out the hops. The primary hops I get are the bitter pine kind that stick to the tongue long after the liquid is gone. There is a breadiness that increases the more sips I take.  Mouthfeel is great, carbed perfectly. This one doesn't finish too dry or too malty, sweet...just right.  Again, I'm glad I tried this one - I respect all the Stone brews. I'd get it again to share, but no need to drink it by myself again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,rawfish,4.23,"Pours clear copper with a rocky finger high head with good retention and pillowy lacing on the glass.  Pine resin and a touch of earth. Sweet amber malt. Bready. Hops clearly dominant and straight forward.  Malt is crusty bread with a touch of caramel sweetness before the rest of the drink is dominated by hops. Pine resin dominant one dimensional and bitterness that claws at the tongue getting beneath the tastebuds.  Ideal body and carbonation with a bitter mouth coating that dries nicely leaving some residue. Alcohol well hidden. Very drinkable, dangerously so.  Lasting numbing bitterness and a pleasant pine resin burn. Stone offers a through thrashing of the palate with their signature pine resin/earthy hops. A readily available hophead staple.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,coldriver,4.25,"22 oz bomber pours a slightly cloudy medium amber with huge head and lacing. Aroma is bready malt with citrus mangos, grapefruit and pine.

147,4083,RTEdmunds,4.32,"A clear orange-ish copper color. A robust head forms and remains for a couple minutes.  Smells of orange rind, powerful hops, with a bouquet of mixed herbyness as well.  The hops lead the Vanguard in this attack. But it isn't painful; the floral flavors follow up immediately. Maltiness is around to make sure the hops don't trample your taste buds.  This is an incredibly well balanced IPA. Carbonation is appropriate, and the alcohol is not ashamed to show make an appearance. Warming presence of the alcohol is welcomed but not excessive.  This is the first time I've had Ruination for a quite a while. Almost forgot why it's a benchmark for great IPAs! A fine product.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,draheim,4.38,"I haven't had a Ruination in probably more than a year, and I look at it as kind of a ""benchmark"" beer. The last time I had it I thought it was abrasively, scorchingly bitter and I just didn't think it was that good. I've had many, many IPAs since then, and I'm curious what my reaction will be now.  22oz bottle (best by 6/4/2012) into a tulip. Pours a beautiful, perfectly clear copper color w/ a big bold white head. Ample carbonation rises from the bottom of the glass. Lots of sticky lacing.  Aroma is classic West Coast hoppy citrus and pine. Really clean, fresh. Just pure resinous hops.  Taste is sticky, piney, grapefruity goodness. Not nearly as abrasively bitter as I remember. a nice clean pale malt backbone elegantly holds everything together.  Mouthfeel is just right. Balanced, smooth, slick, drinkable.  Overall I like this a lot more than I expected to, more than I remember. It might not quite be in the upper echelon (Abrasive, Heady-Topper, Pliny) but it's a solid, accessible beer. Better yet, I can get it anytime I want.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,hopsolutely,4.15,"Pours a clear, red-tinged copper with impressive white head and lacing. Looks beautiful in a pint glass. Mouthfeel is enjoyable, smooth without being oily or too viscous.  Subtle aroma of caramelized malts under a delightfully hoppy forefront. The taste is exceptional, and exceeds the aroma complexity. A well balanced blend of sweet malts transitions nicely into the tropical fruit hop tones, and ends with a stunningly lingering but pleasantly bitter finish. That keeps going and going... Alcohol is dangerously well hidden, with only sign of 7.7% ABV a subtle the warmth in the finish.  All in all, an excellent treat. Would highly recommend.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

HOPS! HOPS! The malts come through also, balancing it all out! Don't get me wrong, this is one damn hoppy beer, but it does not overwhelm! It mellows out, but in a good way! And a warming alcohol embrace to smooth things out! I could go on and on but, honestly, no words can describe this beer. You HAVE to taste it. It's just amazing!

T- Starts off smooth before the big hop bite. More noted than anything is the piney resin type hop character. Finishes nice and bitter. Awesome stuff.  M- Light, bitter, extremely drinkable.

T: Earthy and quality flavor, but not as flavorful as I expected. The difference between the Stone IPA is this is more boozy. Real good flavor all around, though.  M: Medium body -- fresh feel.  O: Quality brew, but it's almost like they took the Stone IPA and just made it boozier. I expected more. Still a good IPA, but not worth the price versus the Stone IPA.

Pleasant, but not much indication of the strength and complexity of this beer.  T/M: Very bitter. This is a super-intense IPA, dominated by piney hops, very dry and herbal. The bitterness hits right off with mouth-puckering intensity, and once the initial hop bomb wears off, there's some citrus and a more restrained bitter finish.  O: Rich, intense, over-the-top bitter, this is a very strong IPA, typical Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,EMPotter,2.63,"The bottle graphics and story/poem were quite impressive and i really enjoy discovering the relationship of graphic creativity and taste of the craft brewers. Based on the reviews, I anticipated an above average hoppy IPA only to be disappointed with a weak hint of hop bitterness, smell and complexity. Color was nice orange but no foamy head and very weak carbonation. Served this beer in a tall beer glass at 38 degrees; serving at a warmer temperature may bring out the flavors, aroma and complexity others commented, I just couldn't find it in my pour.

S: Nice aroma, not too complicated as the style isn't complicated in this part, a solid malty soul with some herbal essence and hops.  T: Flavor is also good, of course it has a lot of hops inside but this are not the main flavor or a disgusting one, also lots of malts and some high alcohol is present.

Some grassy notes and almost no malt presence at all. Wonderful smelling beer.  T - Nothing but hops. A slight touch of grapefruit and passionfruit, but they're immediately overshadowed by a huge amount of piney hops. This may be the most bitter tasting beer I've ever had. Again, not much malt to speak of, just a tiny bit of breadiness.  M - Perfectly carbonated, with a body on the heavier side of medium.

Caramels try to back it up with some strength. It just falls short of long living.  Flavors....wow! Huge bright hops. It's sweet firstly but turns to a tremendously, palate destroying bitter monster. The sweetness can barely contend. It peeks here and there but this pine cone and fronds rip into my teeth. Finishes more generic than pine bittering. Just a nice organic acid bite. Some vanilla sometimes which confused the hell out of me. Like a custard vanilla.  Thick body, creamy, slick, bristling carbonation. Long long long sticky power.  Not bad. Not something I would drink again, but that's me. It's best in the first six ounces.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,TheSixthRing,4.03,"Appearance - Pours a slightly hazy golden orange with a finger width white head. The lace is fairly thin, but sticky.  Smell - Bitter citrus on the nose, but the aroma is faint. Hard to distinguish anything else. A faint hint of malt.  Taste - A lot of bitter grapefruit and orange peel in the hop profile. There's a sweet, bready malt that eats away at the bitter hop dominance, resulting in a 2IPA that's more balanced than most... but maybe that's not such a fantastic thing.  Mouthfeel - Smooth and drinkable. The carbonation hits as expected for the style.  Overall - A solid 2IPA. Not quite as interesting as Lagunitas Hop Stoopid or Pliny the Elder, or even it's 10th anniversary or double dry-hopped counterparts, but it holds it's own nonetheless.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Plenty bitter-- you wouldn't mistake it for anything but an IPA. Serious resins are the main flavor. some pineapple and a little lemon peel.  Medium body with a pleasant burst of flavor. Nice big sudsy mouthfeel. Still, it gets bitter and not much else after a few sips. But a decent choice for a hop blast.  Why is this supposed to be a Double? It's an IPA. Maybe there has been some category creep since this was first released. On tap at Bergie's Pub in Old Town.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

This is one of the best IPA styles I have ever tasted. The taste is full and exhibits nothing but classic IPA. It's delicious in it's balanced floral and hoppy notes.  M: Medium mouthfeel, right in the center of the range. Not too heavy, perhaps slightly on the light side.  O: This is probably in my top two or three for IPA styles.

147,4083,iSip,4.45,"Stone Ruination IPA, 22 oz. bomber: This beer is a lightly hazy dark amber color, and has a nice finger of head that lasts and laces well. The aroma is all out hops; citrus, pine and grass all come through. The flavor is very hop forward. You get a big blast of hops from the start, and the Ruination has quite a bit of bitterness to it. As you become accustomed to the hops (about half way through a glass), the malt starts to make its presence known. This is a signature big IPA, so if you like IPA’s the Ruination is not to be missed. If you are not an IPA fan, this is not the place to start.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The smell is very hoppy but also has a hint of sweetness; but just a hint.  The taste is smooth and light with a very distinct hoppy flavor that is bitter yet bold with a slight sweetness in the after taste. The hoppy flavor is not the generic hoppy flavor. It has a distinct bite up front and a distinctly bitter finish at the end.  The mouthfeel is very good, better when the beer is ice cold but still fine as the beer warms.  Overall I really enjoy this beer. The strength of the brew (7.7%) is hidden behind the distinct hops and the smoothness of the finish. Very good beer - worth a try even if you do not prefer IPA's, and especially if you do.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Pours a light golden ale with a finger of fine soapy light yellow foam that falls to a broken sheet of the same. Excellent clarity and spotty lace. Smells of resin, spice, lemons, grapefruit (strong and bitter rinds), more resin, hops, hops, hops. The nose is really nice on this beer. Sweet malts with citrusy hops - there is an orange, lemon zest flavor here and it does well with the malt profile. The aftertaste resonates for minutes at a time. Medium bodied with moderate carb and a good, long semi dry finish. This is a really good beer. I can say having visited some really fine beer, this one is top notch.

147,4083,JayS2629,4.47,"Pours a pale golden color with a huge, thick, rocky off-white head that has awesome retention and leaves big, frothy rings of lace. A little hazy.  The aroma is an amazing bouquet of floral, pine oil, citrus, tropical, and spice. Big pine and grapefruit domination with spicy edges of black pepper, and tropical elements of pineapple and passion fruit. Some woody notes round things out all on top of a toasty, bready backbone with a touch of caramel. Strong and perfumy with a bite.  Orange marmalade faintly rides on top of a big grapefruit under a pine tree. Prickly pine melts into tropical pineapple and black pepper with woody notes. Loads of citrus with lemony edges and pith. Sharp floral punch with citrusy assaults. The fresh bread background with caramel hints barely holds up, but overall nicely balanced with a slight booze in the finish.  Warming, sharp, smooth, creamy, bright and balanced with a zing in the finish of mint and a slight booze bite.  Tasteful, complex and balanced. Bright and refreshing. Suprisingly very drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,zee3are0,4.03,"Have a couple bottles in my fridge right now.  A - Yellowish head sitting on a pale golden body. Not terribly exciting.  S - Hops, hops and more hops.  T - Hops, hops and more hops. Seriously, this is a Double Imperial IPA. Or a quad IPA. Or a bushel of hops slamming you in the face. Yet, Stone has done a good job with the maltiness character to somehow make it very balanced for such a hop monster. It's not as aggressive as a lot of other Double IPAs, but it's still amongst the most extreme hop bombs you'll ever drink.  M - The carbonation is almost too light; with this many IBUs, it needs to pop on the tongue or risk drowning you in bitterness. If I were kegging this as a homebrew, I'd probably up the PSI a little bit. But it's still delightful.  O - If you're a fan of Double IPAs, this is the most extreme example I've had so far. Maybe there's others that are more hops, but I'd probably have to chew on the leaves. Somehow, Stone has managed to make it drinkable through crafty engineering of nuanced malts. I'll continue to enjoy this beer when I really intend to focus on drinking beer. It's a monster.  Also, pay attention to serving temperature. Too low and it really lacks the fizz it needs to make the experience over your tongue enjoyable. Too warm and it just seems too sour. Right around 43° seems perfect.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,DM1293,4.3,"Stone Ruination was a gamble drink for me. When I tried their Arrogant Bastard Ale, I was overwhelmed by the taste as it was. While it was, in its own right, quite a good ale, I couldn't handle it.  This one I picked up because I was challenged by someone who drank Stone IPA. So I went to this one instead, thinking it to be more of a premium. I did not know it was a Double IPA.  ...  And to be perfectly honest, I couldn't tell you when the Double IPA started and finished. I have had hoppy beers in the past, and Stone Ruination, despite its Double IPA status, actually is a lot more balanced and smooth than ones I've had before. Its still got all the blaze I'd expect from Stone without being undrinkable. I'd go so far as to say this is easy drinking.  Of course, I still can't really describe this drink as anything other than ""hops gone wild"". But this Double IPA is still excellent.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BTFU,4.97,"A - Pours our like liquid amber and has an off-white head that has decent retention with a little bit of lacing. It's slightly cloudy but looks clean  S - The smell is magnificent and is so full of different hops and roasted grains that you'd be OK with an air-freshener filled with it.  T - For such an intensely smelling beer, I expected the flavor to be different, but I was farrrr from disappointed. Its taste carries all of the same hop notes of the smell along with a great toasted maltiness that has some citrus to brighten it up. It's not as overpowering as the smell would lead on, and this balance is one of the keys to what makes this so wonderful.  M - Really creamy and smooth, but it doesn't coat the mouth like some thick beers can. It feels really cleanly, but leaves behind a strong scent that's not obnoxious or grainy  O - This beer imbodies how you can make an intensely hoppy beer (100+ IBUs) without making the taste overwhelming or too bitter.

Smells strongly of hops, and that's pretty much it. Not much depth in the scent.  Tastes very, very hoppy. The bitterness is a lot to deal with. On the bottle it speaks of this IPA being ruinous to any food you plan to ingest. It is. All you can taste is bitter, bitter hops. That's okay if that's all you like in a beer (and maybe a lot of IPA fans do), but I like a little more depth.  Mouthfeel is okay. It's a little thin, and has some bite, but it's okay.

Very bitter hop flavour on the palate backed up by citrus fruits and a little malty sweetness which teases the mouth in an on / off bitter, not so bitter fashion! Very well made in this respect, you get a hit, then it calms down, then you get another big hoppy kick!  Just the right level of carbonation for a smooth and silky mouthfeel and with 100+ IBU's bouncing about in the glass an excellent dry hopped finish and bitter feeling in the mouth.

Maintains a sticky, substantive head with great lacing on the glass. Good carbonation evident.  Nose is a mix of a citrus grove and a pine forest. Also some tropical fruit salad. Mouth-watering aroma. I can pick up subtle hints of an underlying malt foundation. Most of all, there is that pungent hop aroma from the resins.  Taste is primarily pine with some grapefruit-citrus flavors on the edges. There is a malt backbone there, believe it or not, which produces a little sweetness. But, primarily, this is a full-steam-ahead hop assault that produces some lip-smacking, mouth-puckering bitterness. A little alcohol comes through with the hops and the resins.  Mouthfeel is slick and oily from the resins. Nice substantial body on this imperial IPA. Slightly dry finish.  Overall, Stone has produced a hop-lover's dream--an oily/resinous/bitter/citrus/pine bliss.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Pine comes through much more prominent than in its bouquet. Citrus finish but lacking the malt to completely balance out the full effect.  M - Light sparkly mouth feel with a drying finish.

147,4083,mjtiernan,4.13,"12oz bottle poured into a NB globe. Best by 2/7/12...guess I missed this by a bit.  A: Nice two finger head tops a very clear light amber body. Heavy lacing throughout.  S: Hoping the aromatic hops haven’t faded too much, but if they did then this must be super intense when fresh. Lots of resiny floral hops with some pine mixed in there too. I can smell some sweet light caramel malt. There’s a bit of the unfortunate onion characteristic that I personally get from certain types of hops.  T: There is a big floral, citrus and pine hop presence, but not as face melting as I initially expected. This is actually pretty balanced with a proper dose of malt holding up all that hop goodness. It’s not the most citrusy, floral, or piney beer I’ve had, but it’s interesting that they are able to work so many hop profiles in without it being a total mess. Finishes with a bit of warmness and you do get some alcohol in there as well.  M: Medium body, medium carb. There’s a good amount of astringency involved...I feel like it’s removing a very thin layer of my taste buds.  O: Far from balanced, Ruination works on an extreme level even if it is a style of IPA/DIPA that I only crave once in a blue moon (no, not THAT Blue Moon). I’d love to get this fresh on-tap sometime soon and if it’s very different then I’ll re-review.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Thin foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is extremely hoppy with an emphasis on herbal and citrus zest aromas. Taste is of citrus zest, grapefruit, herbal hops, and some slight honey flavors. There is a medium amount of bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a nice crisp level of carbonation with a prickly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good DIPA that I have put off trying entirely too long. A very pleasant surprise.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,WrathsU,4.32,"A - Straw and gold hued body. Moderate white head on an aggressive pour. Retention is moderate, lacing is good.  S - Strong citrus with a lively dankness behind it. Some floral notes as well. Some biscuit in the background but not much.  T - Good firm bitter up front. Definitely some citrus like grapefruit up front and some floral flavors behind that. The malt backbone comes through as well which is impressive for the insane amount of hoppiness that comes through as well. Finishes pretty clean for a nice complete profile.  M - Medium bodied with a bitter stinging sensation. No alcohol burn and carbonation is fine.  O - A very good example of an American IPA. Very solid bittering throughout and the hop profile plays wonderful together. The maltiness is there, just wish it was just a tad more pronounced. Very good beer overall.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BarryMFBurton,4.33,"Ruination, it’s been too long. Unfortunately, I haven’t found an “in-season” bottle of this stuff for months – they always seem to be at least eight weeks past their best-by date. This one, though, has a couple more months left before it fades, so this “liquid poem to the glory of the hop” should go down well. Bottoms up!  A: Excellent shine on the body, a crystal clear gold. Adorning the top is a thick white foam – four fuill fingers of bubbly glory – with a nice web of lacing. Retention is mostly bubbly, but in a silky-looking way. One of the best looks I’ve seen in this style, especially as the foam takes minutes to settle.  S: Dank, dank hops – explosive pine and sticky grapefruit with tangerine and lemon. It’s so satisfyingly pungent. The malts are a little grassy and grainy, though mainly caramel and toasted bread. Light alcohol presence on the end.  T: Hop flavor is intense and enjoyable: starts resiny, a powerful pine, followed by a less intense (but still awesome) orange rind, lime, and grapefruit. So hoppy it’s almost salty. It’s balanced by a hefty amount of caramel malt, with a bread crust taste and the sweetness of honey and strawberry shortcake to match. The balance between the two flavor extremes is what makes this beer so great: the hop sting is strong, but after the thick malt sugariness, the bitters end up just peeking out behind the sweet flavors. In that way, it finishes dry yet with the sweetness of (orange) hard candy.  M: Mouth-coating for the malts, popping with the hops – just perfect. Overall, it feels pretty foamy; weightless, smooth, and bubbly is the name of the game.  O: Nectar of life! A beer this bitter should NOT be this drinkable…alas, it is, and it’s so damn awesome. The distinct bread tastes contrasting with piney hops remind me of Sierra Nevada’s Celebration, but more intense in the hop department. Legendary beer…this might be the first $20 six-pack I ever buy.

Flavor follows similarly. Hops are palate killing up front. Finishes with bitterness as well, with some sweet malts in the middle, and citrus aftertaste that just lingers on the palate. I had this right after Founders Centennial and it blew it away. Big resinous mouthfeel, plenty of carbonation, with a slightly dry finish. Good stuff, and rather unique (but not as unique as RuinTen--that one is in its own category).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S - Pure hops. Citrus, floral, and piney aromas. Alcohol is slightly noticeable. Can't get much maltiness with all the hops.  T - Follows the aroma. A definite hop assault and very bitter. Can get the tiniest bit of malt and some alcohol but mostly hops.  M - Medium body. Medium carbonation. Slightly dry finish. Bitterness hangs around in your mouth. Slight warming sensation from the alcohol.  O - This is a great beer. It looks, smells, tastes, and feels exactly the way an imperial IPA should. I love the hop aroma and taste complexity. I would maybe like to see a little bit more malt aroma and taste to add more balance, but I understand that Stone's intention was to overload it with hops. The alcohol is not very noticeable for a beer that is nearly 8% ABV, but once you get to the bottom of your glass, you know it's there. If you're into double/imperial IPAs, I highly recommend this one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,EricCioe,4.15,"This pours a very clear pale gold with a white head rising up and leaving a bit of lace. On the nose there is no indication of malt, which is fine, and tons of pine resin and grapefruit rind. In the mouth there is huge bitterness up front, almost scorching the middle part of the tongue. There isn't a lot of complexity here, and that's just fine by me. Sometimes scorched earth is the best policy with big IPAs. The body is medium light, somewhat surprising to me, and the finish is medium and shorter than expected.  Overall, this is a nice IPA on the dry side of the style. I think the somewhat small body is an artifact of it being so dry, but the taste is worth it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Pint quaffed while having lunch & waiting for a new windshield to be installed.  Pours a clouded pale yellow, unfiltered. Nose on this IPA is very nice initially, bitter, citrusy, but after the beer begins to warm, the onion comes through & messes with the experience.  Ruination is a beer I've revisited a few times to try to understand its sterling reputation. Massive doses of onion throw me off immediately, with a rank bitterness that makes me think of chewing onion bubble gum. There might be pine or something else pleasing hereabouts, but I can't get past the bulbous sharpness. It's a chore to get down.

An inviting fruity and piney aroma erupts out of the glass. Man, this thing is freakin great. The bitterness isn’t detracting in the least. The hops and malt work great.

There isn't much complexity in this beer, just straight up IBUs.  Mouthfeel felt correct - maybe could have toned down the carbonation a tad bit.

So far so good.  The Smell.... my oh my. The most complex and delicious hop aroma i've ever witnessed. Slighty earthy/musky first, then floral, sharp citrus with orange and grapefruit, then pineapple. A touch of alcoholic sweetness. Fantastic aroma that stings the nose a bit.  Taste: A hop bomb, more floral flavor than the nose let on, there's pine and mint here as well, resting on a very lean but well crafted malt backbone of cracker/biscuit. The alcohol doesn't go unnoticed but fits in well. Sharp bitterness in the finish.  Feel: Light/ medium bodied, slightly syrupy from the alcohol and slick with hop resin. Moderate carbonation.

147,4083,TheCondor,4.33,"Bought this beer at the store...Heard a lot about it, and I like IPA, so here we go! Poured from the bottle into an Imperial pint glass  Appearance - Nice golden color with a big, fluffy three finger head with superior lacing and head retention. Its not transparent, but certainly not dark either.  Smell - Wicked strong fruit aromas, lemon, citrus, grapefruit and pine. Did I mention hoppy?  Taste - Obviously given the name and description, not to mention the brewey's obvious intent, this beer is aggressively hopped. However, it isn't just some hopped-up one dimensional freak show. There are nice citrus and grapefruit flavors to it, and just a touch of malt in there to kind of ease the finishing tranisition.  Mouthfeel - Pretty clean finish, you certainly can't get away from the hops. I can taste the hops even when I burp.  Overall - I really like this brew as a one time drink, although I don't think I would drink it very often. I like IPA's, but this one is a little too aggressively hopped for me. I know plenty of fellas, and it looks like plenty of BA's, who love it and would drink it every day, but not me. But that doesn't mean it isn't good! Because it is! But it is not a neophyte's beer, or someone just getting into the craft scene. It is quite potent, strongly hopped. To use boxing as a comparison, it's like a charger or inside fighter, vis a vis Mickey Ward.

Tons of pine and grapefruit, but just enough lightly toasted malt to give it some backbone. So bitter you'll pucker and might even get goosebumps.  A punisher, this.

147,4083,BeardedRiker,4.2,"The last time I had Stone's Ruination was years ago before I had really got into craft beer. I remember it being insanely hoppy. Double IPAs are probably my favorite type of beer. I'll admit that I'm a hop head. Now it's time to drink this beer and again and give a proper review from a much more experienced beer lover.  Despite the name ""Ruination"", there is no ruining in how the beer looks. I poured this into a sort of snifter style glass and the head, it being an off-white color, grew almost two fingers but I kept pouring delicately so that the head went above the top of the glass. The head was creamy and like a fluffy pillow. A decent amount of bubbles rise to the top. The beer itself is a clear golden.  It's not surprising that this beer smells insanely of hops. I can smell it from my chair while it sits on the table in front of me while I type of this review. To me it's much like many of Lagunitas' excellently-hopped beers. Ruination is citrusy, with lemon and orange peel being strong with grapefruit and pineapple in there too. It also has a pine resin sweetness that I love about many hoppy beers. Spiciness tingles the nose as well. Underneath all of the hoppiness is a fair amount of malt graininess that keeps it from seeming like a one trick pony.  The taste is stronger than the smell and that makes this delightful. Again, this is just what I love in a DIPA. It has great bitterness but there's plenty of citrusy goodness and pine sweetness that make the hops very enjoyable. Being from Texas, I get pick up some ruby red grapefruit in there, even though I don't actually like grapefruit. :P Again, this reminds me of what Lagunitas does so well: hops to the extreme but not overwhelming. The malt brings the bready graininess that was present in the smell. Although this beer is 7.7% ABV I can hardly tell.  I'd say this beer is on the lighter side of medium-bodied but it's not lacking in body nor does it feel watery. It's very smooth but he medium carbonation keeps it lively while I'd say despite the hoppiness it the sweetness gives it a sticky finish. Exceptional drinkability.  This is an excellent beer. Great hops, but not overwhelming, and oh so drinkable. You know, I may be a bit biased with this review. I'll be honest. If this was a Lagunitas beer I probably wouldn't give it such a high score, because I'm used to this from them, but this is a Stone beer that is distinct from their other offerings and they've delivered well.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,eandersen,4.43,"This was one of the first beers that really turned me into a hop head, so I figured there was no better beet to come back to for my first review on here! So here goes nothing.  A- Absolutely gorgeous, exactly what I want to see when I pour a DIPA. Nice deep golden coloring, decent amount of carbonation coming up from the bottom of the glass and a 1.5 finger fluffy white head. Beautiful.  S- Fresh piney hops, with a nice full backbone of citrus...oranges, grapefruits, maybe even a hint of lighter peachy citrus notes  T- Hops obviously come on nice and strong throughout the mouth, but this beer is absolutely not hoppy just to say it's hoppy. While many DIPAs I've tried are all hops and lacking in other areas, this brew is surprisingly well balanced. Secondary taste to the killer hop flavor mirrors the secondary smells- namely grapefruit and orange. But there is also a significant malty note mid-tongue that does not come across in the smell but is much appreciated in the taste. No real alcohol presence even though it sits at 7.7%.  M- Oily, resinous, everything you expect from a big IPA such as this, yet with enough crispness and drying to keep you going back.  O- What can I say, this was the beer that introduced me to the DIPA which has since evolved into my favorite style. Every bit as great as I remember it being the first time I sipped on it. Phenomenal beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BeerMaverick,3.62,"A - Lighter golden color (almost yellow) with a whopping 2 inches of frothy white head. The harpoon ipa glass is completely clouded with lace. I am very surprised at how light and clean this beer looks for a double IPA.  S - A lot of citrusy and floral notes here. Not as in-your-face in terms of hops as most DIPAs. Some fruit presence such as orange and grapefruit.  T - The taste is pretty much the aroma for this beer except for a slightly more dominant grapefruit facet. Very well-balanced (in relation to hops and malts) for a DIPA, which isn't necessarily what one hopes for when tasting a DIPA.  M - Some lingering hops, as expected, in the aftertaste of this very light-bodied beer.  O - Overall I was kind of disappointed by this beer (as you probably guessed from my scores above). It is a very good beer, but it has everything that anyone could want in an IPA, not a DIPA. It is nearly perfect in terms of all the characteristics of a single IPA (it tastes just like Ballast Point's Sculpin IPA to me) and if it were, I would probably give it a perfect score. The bottle says ""IPA"" and the alcohol percentage as well as everything else about this beer screams IPA, but I'll trust BeerAdvocate's classification as a DIPA and rate it as such.

147,4083,rdilauro,4.69,"01/29/15: Probably , oh well, I cant even remember how many Ruinations I have had over the years. But what I can say is that after tasting so many craft beers in the past 3 or 4 years, this one from Stone still is near the top. Perfectly balanced, the ABV, the IBU, the Malt, everything. Crisp but full, chug gable yet slow sipped. Without a doubt my favorite beer from Stone  Oh, another great one from STONE. I read more about this ALE before I tasted it. My expectations were so high. I popped the cap. Immediately, my senses were filled with HOP, HOPS and MORE HOPS. I loved IT. I poured it into a tulip wine glass. The aroma and bouquets were even stronger now. I put my nose into the glass and I was in HOP heaven. The ALE was brilliant and clear, with a small head, but a strong head. I detected some tropical fruits. Maybe some pineapple, and also some citrus like a New Zealand Sauvignon Blancs Marlborough grapefruit full wines. Then the taste and it all began. Almost like bells going off in my head, ringing in a new year. The bitterness from the hops and yeast were so in your face, but at the same time not slapping you around. STONE says, once you have had Ruination, you are ruined! Well, to me, now that I've had it, I'm somewhat addicted to it. Its not for everyone. People that say that like hoppy beer, ok, there are many others to build up to. This one, just like better wines, you have to get your palate ready for it.

Smell blows you away - a blast of citrus hops and piney hops and malty sweetness.  Creamy, creamy, creamy deliciousness. Love the mouthfeel. Even with the strong smell and overpowering flavors, I think the mouthfeel is the most distinctive part of this beer.  Taste: Aggressive pine hops, bitterness, followed by honey sweetness. I prefer Stone IPA to Stone Ruination IPA because the former is sweeter than the latter, and because the pine hops in the Ruination are so aggressive.  There's nothing subtle about Ruination. I personally would have preferred for more citrus hops instead of so much pine. And I don't think I could have more than the one 22 ounce bottle because the taste is so in-your-face.

147,4083,Philousa,3.85,"Pours a light copper, clear, with one finger thick head. Less lacing than I was expecting, but still there. Strong piney hop aroma. Sharp citrus and some bitterness from the hops as well. Light malt with some sweet caramel in the background. Light citrus, piney hop flavor carries to the tongue and attacks your tongue with bitter hop flavor, which lingers quite a while. I realized halfway through the 22oz that the lemon zest stays with you throughout. Mostly watery and a good helping acidig, it's gulpable, but too harsh to consume quickly.  This is a good DIPA, but I'm spoiled living in the Bay Area, because there are better out there, namely Pliny and Double Jack. This is still a good DIPA, but its range is thin compared to the aforementioned champs. It's funny, because it's a lot easier to find the aforementioned Pliny and Double Jack than it is to find a fresh Ruination. I went to three liquor stores before I found one that was within the ""Best By"" limits. most were over a month overdue. Let's sell these things on time, people! Good try, Stone.

Stone has hit this style out of the park.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,rarbring,4.1,"The beer is clouded brass colored, an off-white head, little lacing but good curtains.  Smell of tropical fruits, grape-fruits, passion fruit, and flowers in her hair ...  Sweet start, toffee, some bread, then a squashed grapefruit on top of mango.  Medium carbonation, oily and slick, a good body, a long good dry finish.  A very good IPA, by all measures.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,FattyJLE,4.27,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  S - Intense hop aroma. Orange peel, lemon zest, grapefruit rind, pine. Very juicy. Sugary malt in the background.  A - Golden color and quite clear, especially for an IIPA. Two-finger, fluffy off-white head with sticky lacing.  T - Well-balanced between hops and malts. Candy-like malts support the very complex hop flavor. Pine, citrus, herbal, minty and spicy hops blend together in an interesting combination. The flavor of pine lingers on the palate. Alcohol present but not overpowering and quite pleasant. Finishes semi-sweet.  M - Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Alcohol warming appropriate.  O - Another quality offering from Stone. Was surprised by the great differences between this and Stone IPA. This definitely is not a ""double"" of the IPA, but is quite original in its flavor and characteristics. Would definitely recommend.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Has a touch of the floral aromas in the flavor as well.  M- Well balanced and great body. Smooth.  O- I think this one will take just a little getting used to for me.

Some sweet malts also comes through, but hops are definitely prominate...  T - Big citrus profile. Grapefruit and orange. Some pine comes through with some sweet malt. Finishes with a good hop bitterness...  M - Medium bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation and a fairly dry finish...  O - It's been a while since i've picked one of these up.

Great hop with citrus taste. Bitter but palatable which makes this drinkable. It is more on the bitter side, otherwise, a great IPA. Obviously, Stone is a respectable brewery. So there is no reason to pass this up.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Lot's of grapefruit, pine needles, tangerine. Great aroma  T: Super full of fruity flavor. Quite a bit of aggressive hops, lots of good bitterness.  M: Very wet, medium carbonation. A little thick  Overall, this is awesome. A real classic as far as IPAs go. It's just taken me a while to get around to reviewing it",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Bodart,4.38,"Poured into my Ballast Point Big Eye ipa glass (compliments of Capital Ale House-Richmond). Has a nice color and moderate foam head. Can smell the citrus which makes for a nice ipa. Has a pretty strong hop bitterness that I really like, yet it doesn't overwhelm the citrus flavor that I really love. I rank Ruination up there with the finest ipa's on the market. With 7.7 abv, this is a big league ipa with a big league taste. I am yet to find a Stone Brewery product that isn't top notch!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BilbosNuts,4.32,"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass.  A: Pours a nice, somewhat cloudy burnt orange color. It has a one finger, rocky white head that sticks around for quite a while. A small amount of scattered bubbles rise to the top.  S: It has a nice hop profile that consists of piney and resin aromas. Citrus fruits including grapefruit and limes also make an appearance. A touch of biscuit malts are also noticeable.  T: There is a huge amount of hops in the taste. It starts of with the citrus (grapefruit and lime again), then evolves releasing the pine and resin tastes. It finishes very resiny, with a big bitter bite.  M: It feels how a double IPA should. It has that oily, resiny feel to go along with its medium body. The amount of carbonation is perfection, as it allows the flavors to travel. The oily feel leaves a slight layer of flavor on the palate, while the bitter finish cleanses.  O: This is a fine DIPA. Stone rarely disappoints and this one is a huge success. A great example of the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

For my birthday, since I couldn't get the beer I wanted, I drank this. and POW! It delivers Hops like no other beer. This beer will completely take over your pallet, and no matter what you drink for the rest of the night, nothing will taste like this beer. It will leave you wanting more and only more.  Careful, too much of this stuff and you will find yourself in crazy places!  Great Beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

T- this beer starts of pretty balanced and moves to a bitter bite that make me pucker. Strong notes of pineapple and tangerine. Very subtle subtle malt flavor. Extreme HOP bitterness.  M- thick syrupy feel with a lingering bitterness.  O- I love this DIPA. Stone always seems to make beers overloaded with hops and this beer is a good example of that. It's a delicious beer but at $6.19 for a bomber it may be for special occasions only.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,rogueleonardi,4.91,"I've had this both out of a bomber bottle, and on tap at South Park Pizza tavern here in Dayton. Out of the bottle was much more enjoyable then the tap. Golden blonde color (standard ipa look) The smell is a strong but balanced floral. The taste is exactly what I would expect from Stone. A strong overwhelmingly flavorful beer. This is not an IPA I would suggest starting out on, this is a very full flavored, bitter beer and would most likely be to much to handle for anyone that is just starting to drink craft beer. However if you've had an IPA or two and know what your getting into, you might want to drink with caution, you will never want another IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Will need to revise this review sometime down the line.  Bought a bottle from the brewery and poured into a hotel plastic cup. Notes were scribbled on the hotel notepad as follows:  -great, long-lasting white foam head. Impressive. -nice piney hop aroma. -tastes like a sticky sweet hop bomb. -full mouthfeel. -overall - a nice double IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jrnyc,4.5,"Been drinking this one for over a year now, never reviewed it though. First hats off to Stone for bottle dating and being so aggressive in promoting fresh beer. This one was a month old.  So, this one isn't for the faint of heart. This one blasts me with hops out of the bottle with the smell and the taste. You have to be a true hop-head to enjoy this one. If you can get by the bitterness there are some nice tastes in there. I think I prefer my IPAs to be a bit more flavorful, but this is a great IPA and will put hair on your chest if you drink enough of it :)!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,teromous,3.35,"A: It is a medium shade of amber, with more hints of orange than brown. The beer is mostly transparent, showing limited haze through the glass. The head is a fluffy white billow that sticks well to the side of the glass.  S: I get a nice hop scent. I get a light resin scent, layered with more citrus on top. There is a hint of what smells like noble hops, with a light earthiness. Mostly I get a citrus scent though, which is like grapefruit and lemon peel.  T: There's more bitterness in the beer than hop flavor. I get what tastes like a bitter lemon rind. I don't get as much of the refreshing hop flavor that I expected from the scent. The malt character is very subdued in this beer. The aftertaste consists of what tastes like spruce fronds. The bitterness is right there, but I want more flavor.  M: The mouthfeel is very smooth with great carbonation. There is a punch of bitterness and it lingers strongly in the aftertaste. The beer is medium bodied, and leaves a light puckering of astringency.  O: Overall the beer is alright, but I wanted more hop flavor out of this. I can't call it average because it's better than some of the other average IIPA's I've had, but it also strongly lacks the flavor of many others. It's hard to call this one, because a bottle can lose a lot of flavor based on how long it's been shelved. I bet this is a lot better on tap. I would drink it again, but only if I could figure out how to verify the date, and only to re-review the beer. As it stands right now, I wouldn't pick this up if I had a chance to buy an IIPA from another brewery.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,lawlerj,3.75,"Poured from a bomber into a wine glass.  A - Pours a hazy light amber with a patchy slightly off white head.  S - Big grapefruit aroma with some citrus and pine notes mixed in as well.  T - The taste more or less follows the aroma - big grapefruit and citrus flavors; also a touch asringent. No malt backbone to speak of here - just a hint, but it's not really balanced. Just big, bitter hops. The other flavors do come out a bit once the beer warms, but not a ton.  M - Medium bodied, feels a little oily and slightly less carbonated than I would like.  O - Overall, I wasn't super crazy about this. It's a good beer, but it might just be a bit much for me in the hop department. I'll probably give it another try in a year or two when I have a chance.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Raven3464,5,"Appearance: The beer pours a gorgeous golden-orange body with a one finger heard. The clarity of this beer is second to none for the style.  Smell: There is an initial explosion of hop bitterness and citrus. This is balanced by an underlying aroma of sweet pine, lemon juice, and fresh flowers. This is what an IPA or Double should smell like.  Taste: The citrus hop bomb hits immediately. This transitions into a grapefruit and orange sweetness on the mid-palate. A freshly baked bready malt flavor can also be detected. The beer finishes with a pine bitterness that lingers forever.  Mouthfeel: It is oily with just enough carbonation to cleanse the palate for another sip of hop heaven. The ""feel"" makes the fruit flavors and hop bitterness stand out on the tongue. As mentioned above, a dry bitter taste lingers for quite a long time.  Overall: Simply put, this is a hop lovers dream. There should be a picture of this beer under the definition of Double IPA. Kudos to Stone for creating this masterpiece for which all Double IPA's should be judged. By far this is my favorite beer for the style and worth all ""5s.""",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Hop resins coat the tongue with a dry and bitter finish.  O- similar to other stone ipas I've had with a big citrus and piney hop presence and the malt taking a backseat.

So many flavors going on here. The floral hops transition to a sugary grapefruit creaminess. Twinge of oak and vanilla. Tongue is left with a bitter resin that just feels right.  M: Moderate carbonation, but I was hoping for more. Slightly sticky and smooth.  O: Drinkability is fantastic.

But than again, I weight appearance much less than the other categories.  s: strong IPA grapefruit smell. Liked it. I am fond of the citrusy style IPA's  t: continues with the strong citrus/grapefruit flavor. Personally, liked the amount of hoppiness, and found the ""bitterness"" just right. Read the entire bottle, to see if they added ""grapefruit"" flavoring. Can't believe they achieve that flavor just from the hops. the bottle did describe ""brewers yeast cells"". Wonder if that is how they introduced such strong citrus presence.  mf: good. slight after taste which I didn't appreciate.  overall: good citrus flavored IPA. Liked it, and will buy again.

Citrus but again, mostly grapefruit. A pretty epic smelling hop bomb. T- More balanced then I expected but a seriously bitter hoppy beer. A nice malty character that I was surprised to see come though, Kinda biscuity. The hops are more flowery and earthy then the grapefruit smell led me on. A liquid poem to the glory of the Hop!, just as it says on the bottle. This is an epic IPA M- A creamy smooth mouthfeel with a bitter numbing effect. Not the easiest to drink but easy enough for me. Good hoppy aftertaste. O- This is a pretty epic IPA, I really enjoy it and will definitely have again.

147,4083,troysoy2,4.23,"Ok, Ruination... do your worst.  Poured into a pint glass, there's a nice, bubbly, active finger's worth of head. It eventually drops to a film over the surface, but never goes away entirely. Beautiful light amber color, with a tinge of orange.  The smell when I popped the bottle open make me laugh a little inside. It becomes a bit more muted than you may think, given some time in the pint glass. It's a little on the citrusy side, with a touch of grapefruit. Plenty of hop oils, and maybe even a hint floral.  This is a delicious beer. It's bitter, yes, but if you can get past the obvious, there are layers and layers of flavor waiting for you. Bready malt, Piney at first, then amazingly grapefruit-centric on the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is top notch. Drying at the end, but somehow very refreshing.  So that's what 100+ IBUs is like? Hmm, not as intimidating as I might have thought. A great, hoppy IPA, and one that I'm going to need some more of... ASAP.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Smells strong of fresh hops, pine, grassiness, tangerine.  Tastes as good as it smells, very bright and punchy, bitter upfront, mellowing in the middle and nicely balancened bitter aftertaste.  Feels silky and resinous. A little viscosity makes this a great texture. Great feel of booze and dryness on the finish.  Overall I think this is a great beer. Great hops done right, another winner from Stone.

The smell alone drives me crazy, a nice blend of citrus (grapefruit), and piney hop aromas. A very clean malt flavor, a massive amount hops, and a smooth warming sensation from the alcohol. This was one of the brews that turned me towards hoppier beers. A must try for any beer lover.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,Lockedin,5,"I know all 5's are supposed to be rare, but I'm spending one here.  A: Absolutely gorgeous! Pours a completely clear dark amber color; I doubt the Hubble telescope could achieve this kind of clarity. 1.5 Finger white / orange head. Medium / Low carbonation. Amazing lace sheets the pint glass throughout the drink. IMHO this is what beer SHOULD look like.  S: Very floral hops, pineapple, pine, and an underlying biscuity malt presence round out a hop heavy, yet balanced nose, 7.7 abv (as listed on the bottle) is nowhere to be found.  T: Floral upfront, followed by a quick reminder of malt, and then the palate ruining pine and citrus hops seize the taste buds. Malts try to regain some presence in the end with a reminder of fresh, doughy biscuits; but the floral, citrus hops dominate and subdue the tastebuds with a lingering bitter finish that goes on forever. Alcohol presence is only noticed with a slight warming of the belly halfway through.  M: Medium body, though somewhat oily, the carbonation is just enough to scrub the tongue clean for more ruinous hops on the next sip. As mentioned in the taste, the finish goes on and on - pleasant bitterness remains, but not too much. A balanced hop bomb?  O: Hands down one of my favorite beers. Amazingly easy to approach, despite the gargoyle's warning on the back of the bottle, despite the name and reputation. This is a BIG beer in every sense, and it slaps every sense upside the head. It will seize your attention, grab you by the nose and make everything else you taste this evening seem bland in comparison - but it that's the idea, isn't it?  Amazing stuff!  Again, all 5's should be rare, reserved for nectar such as this.  Thanks Stone!!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Above average lacing. 4/5  Smell: Crisp explosion of citrus hop bitterness. Zesty lemon rind and pine. A little floral. Some malty sweetness too. Really fresh aroma. 4.5/5  Taste: An explosion of awesome flavor on palate. Earthy, citrus hop bitterness hits you right away. Some grapefruit and orange sweetness on the mid-palate. Light bready malt flavor on the mid-palate as it layers. Finish is a very earthy grapefruit bitterness and resiny pine that lingers. Flavors are extremely fresh. 5/5  Mouthfeel: Light-medium bodied, medium-high carbonation. A little oily. Finishes dry and bitter. The carbonation makes the zesty citrus flavors and bitterness of the beer really pop on the tongue. 4.5/5  Overall: The golden standard of double IPA's.  Recommendation: This is a great beer for hop heads. Perhaps not the best first ""craft"" beer for casual beer drinkers, but an absolute must try once you get your beer feet wet.  Pairings: Backyard-cooked hamburgers.  Cost: $6.99 for a 22 oz (bomber) bottle.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S: The citrus and piney hops jump right out at you. The malty background is rarely imminent, but it is there. This is a classic West Coast IPA.  T: Like so many before me have mentioned, this really does terrorize your palate, but I love it. The bitterness of the hops is really outstanding.  M: What a refreshing beer for the IBU's it possesses. It has a nice dry finish to it.  O: One of my favorite West Coast beers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

T: Hop oils, citrus, some pine. Bready malts blend into the hops. It doesn't assault the palate like some other DIPAs, but rather caresses it into submission. As much as I love Stone IPA, it might taste like nada after one of these.  M: Smooth and creamy. Considerably better out of the glass than the bottle (duh), but more so than with other beers. Dry, clean finish.  O: One of my favorite DIPAs, and the best easily accessible one. The only problem is the price - I hide them when friends come over.

S - Big hops, piney and citrusy, with some noticeable malt in the back. It's almost like they crammed an orange into the bottle or something.  T - There is so much more here to offer than your standard IPA. Malts are noticeable and bready in the beginning and middle... and then the hops pimp-slap your tongue. Bitter on the sides of the tongue, and very citrusy. I could swear they put lemon or orange zest in with this one. Kind of yeasty hoppy finish. Incredible balance of flavors.  M - Very creamy for most of the way, with a dry IPA finish. Alcohol is a bit noticeable, but more warming than anything.  O - This may be a bold statement at $18 for a sixer, but I think this one is worth my money. It's that good. Because of how well balanced it is, you might not notice just how hoppy it is until you find out that parts of your tongue may have gone numb, so to speak, rendering other tastes nearly pointless.

Look is a clear orange, small bubbles from the carbonation and a big fluffy white head.  Aroma is lots of pine needles soaked in hop oil, bitter grapefruit, and a touch of orange. A dank herbal aroma is quite pungent too, with a touch of vegetal hops. Overall the pine is smacking you in the face.  Don't try to drink another beer after this beer. It rips your taste buds up, in a good way. Incredible amount of bitterness hammers the palate almost right away. The mild grapefruit/orange come out first but are quickly buried under the pine/bitterness that grabs hold of the tounge. Carbonation moves the bitterness right along to a big dry finish. Overall medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation.  Had this beer quite a few times before but had to pick it up when I saw it on tap at my local liquor store. This is a once in awhile beer for myself. Not something I want to try and enjoy all the time, but it certaintly gets it point across in a big way!

147,4083,JDogg,4.87,"It's hard to add to the accolades of this near-perfect DIPA, except to say that: 1. The aroma is off the scale, and 2. Giant Supermarkets now sells the bomber for $5.00 in Northern Virginia, which means this masterpiece has achieved a distribution that should right-size a lot more palates",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,brewsclues,4.3,"A: Poured a golden honey with a healthy lacing. The head was 1/2 the whole glass  S: Big blast of citrus and piney hops. As a hop head, this is a heavenly smell, although the smell doesn't necessarily distinguish itself from other awesomely hoppy beers. Great grapefruit nose here, (very) reminiscent of DFH 60 Minute.  T: This is a really smooth, almost creamy IPA. Again, the key here is a balance between malt and hops. A beer this strong can go to one of the two extremes pretty easily. It is over 100+ IBUs, after all. Great citrus notes at the front, and the hops hit the back of the tongue without overpowering the imbiber. Can't believe how well the pine and resin flavors come out throughout the beer. Stone nailed this one.  M: Very little carbonation, but very refreshing.  O: A well-balanced IPA with enough pop for the hop heads out there. Really intrigued be this beer, and will be back for more. Kudos, Stone!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Instantly smell the hops (pine) along with citrus but the hops are definitely stronger. Taste: Very predictable, tastes just as you would think after enjoying the beautiful aromatics..but very delicious. Smooth, nice bitter from hops, some sweenesst and accents of the citrus. Overall a great beer!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ShemRahBoo,4.42,"Pours a lovely golden/red copper color. The beer itself is relatively cloudy. Nice head that shows great retention the whole way down. Aroma is extremely satisfying. Very bright citrus hop aroma with a touch of pine. Very vibrant aroma. The taste is just like the smell. Nice malt sweetness with a large over the top citrus hop flavor. Not as bitter as expected, but this ale really packs in the hop flavor. Citrus, candied grapefruit, and lemony tastes all backed by just a touch of malt sweetness. This beer goes down very smooth. Good carbonation, medium bodied feel. Overall this beer is pretty stunning. Crazy amount of hop flavor in this one keeping you coming back for more.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,flyingpig,4.08,"Clear, amber orange, foamy white head that lasts well & leaves lacing on the glass.  Unique smelling beer. Very floral, almost perfume like aroma to it with some light pine hops coming through as well. There is a fruity, grapefruit like smell with some citrus and a little hint of some tropical fruits too.  Lots of herbal and floral notes, a sort of perfume like, summery taste to the beer with some citrus hops to follow. There is a mild tropical bitterness & some good pine hops that were apparent in the nose as well. The alcohol content is very well hidden.  Smooth with a medium body and carbonation levels about the same. There is a slight bitter tang to it and a rather bitter, hop filled finish to the beer.  Not as strong flavour or smell wise as I had been expecting from a Double IPA and the hints of perfume in both were rather unusual but pleasant none the less. A very good beer that was very easy to drink & good in all areas.  http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,fo5s,4.33,"12oz bottle served in a heavy seas shaped pint. Enjoy by 1.9.12 on the bottle, so I believe that means it was bottled 10-9-11 (and has been in the fridge for ~2 weeks), so this is as fresh as I'll ever get it on the east coast.  A- pours an amberish gold with a fluffy 2-finger head. Good clarity, and great lacing.  S- bold piney smell with just a hint of malt in the background. Definitely a west-coast creation.  T- true to the smell, strong, fresh pine from the hops with a noticeable malt backbone (for a west-coast DIPA...). Fairly bitter. A touch of citrus/orange on the finish.  M- fairly creams. Sizeable body on this one, relative to west-coast style.  O- overall a classic, and often underappreciated DIPA. This one does fade noticeably with age, so it's not every day I can find it fresh...but when I can, it's a sure thing.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Durge,4.42,"A light golden tanish color with a giant white head and plenty of lace. The nose detects lemon cotton candy, and flowery banana bread. Very nice and kind of unique as hoppy brews go. The flavor brings lots more hops in the form of sweet bready herbal grass goodness. There’s wheat and sort of peachy fruit nougat. Delicious in a medium plus body with a polite carbonation and an easy, lightly frothy feel. A class hop brew!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Tons of hops and juicy, citrusy fruits. Very well balanced and great tasting.  Mouthfeel is very creamy and well carbonated. Medium bodied and leaves a nice bitter aftertaste.

T- Citrus and spice up front and hop bitterness In the after. After a few seconds the hop bitterness really gets you. Very well balanced.  M- Very well balanced. Not slick but not sticky. The hops get you in the jaw and stick around.  Overall an excellent IPA. Well worth it and one I will definitely return to.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,falloutsnow,4.03,"Bottle purchased from Friar Tuck's in Savoy, IL. No best by or bottled on date. Shared with friends. Poured into a standard US pint glass.  Pours a 1cm head of off-white foam, smallish bubbles. Head fades gradually to a thin ring around the glass with some islands, leaving decent lacing that is refreshed with each sip. Body is a light orange color with yellow highlights.  Aroma is hop-forward, though I can get some malt as well. Citrus, grapefruit and lemon, zest are most prominent, some pine in the background. Malt sweetness if subdued, but present in the back.  Taste opens with light citrus and floral hops along with malt sweetness in front of tongue. Mid-taste yields more hops - pine and slight grapefruit bitterness - tempered with slight malt sweetness. Back of the tongue picks up significant bitter grapefruit, lemon, and pine. Very nice flavors, good balance, no detectable alcohol.  Body is medium to medium-heavy, with moderate carbonation to keep things moving. Semi-dry finish.  I know this bottle was at least around three months old, and thought this was easily the best DIPA I've had yet. It was hop-forward, but not to the point of it being caustic. The ethanol, while ""getting up there"" in percent, was not detectable and attempting to beat the drinker into submission. Not ruinous, but actually rather pleasant; still wouldn't want to drink any other beer after this, though. In all, would like to try this much fresher and see how it turns out.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,minterro,4.09,"Single 12oz bottle from Spartan Spirits in East Lansing.  A & S: rich resiny and piney hop aroma, and even though the smell is rich it isn’t very strong…if that makes sense. Light, but bright orange cloudy looking beer, but the vigorous bubbles rising from the bottom makes the beer appear lively. This beer has a really interesting look to it. Head is pretty nice it pours about a finger and a half of semi foamy off white head, which decrease over a short period till a solid layer is left and hangs around for the rest of the tasting. Lacing clings very well.  T & M: the robustness in the taste, but doesn’t fully come out till a bit into the taste. The most prominent flavors in this beer are piney and citrus hops. There is a slight sweet malty backbone. There is an interruption of hints of alcohol and buttery tones in the mid taste. I think I like that aftertaste the most about this beer’s taste. Is very powerful and it becomes stronger after 5 or so seconds. The aftertaste is piney and pleasantly bitter, with hints of floral elements. Fairly drinkable beer. Medium bodied but a bit watery, medium (on the higher end) for carbonation.  O: A very pleasant beer overall. I could be I had a really good bottle of their regular IPA but this wasn’t as good as I remember the regular IPA being.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Intrinsic,4.74,"Ruination IPA is a pretty much perfect example of the style, but you better have a strong stomach for it. The acids are killer...  Its a golden straw colour with little head and even less retention - mine died quite quickly. Despite this, it looks very appetizing. The smell is perfect. Its like walking through an evergreen forest with orange and lime trees scattered throughout. It just screams out hops. And as you would expect from such a strong smelling beer, the taste is something to behold as well. Its by far the most bitter, hoppy beer I've ever had. It isn't well balanced at all, but I don't think that was the point of this one. It shocks you into submission (and your stomach will not be happy). Its a very dry beer and well carbonated. Overall, it isn't perfect, but it's pretty damn close.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,TMoney2591,4.1,"Served in a tumbler at The Tribes.  The Accidental Highway to Hell Tour motors forth! This stop pours a clear light amber topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises lime, light lemon zest, light orange zest, caramel, and pine resin. The taste holds notes of caramel, pine, very light lime, black pepper, lemon zest, light pineapple, and balsa. The body is on the heftier end of the light medium spectrum, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta dry finish. Overall, this is one beastly DIPA, one that wrecks the tongue with its massive hop concentration but still goes down eerily easily. Good times.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

T- Tons of floral, perfume, and oak/wood notes. Quite earthy and herbal. Some juicy citrus on the very bitter finish.

Fantastic flavor, and certainly not as ""ruining"" as they claim - all the bitterness is really well balanced and adds to the flavor.  M: Medium body with carbonation on the low side of medium.

147,4083,bornridiculous,3.94,"This beer is a prime example of how rating numbers aren't perfect indicators for how much you will actually like a beer. I am pretty sure based on how the numbers shake out this beer will be less than a 4, but I will admit it is my current favorite beer. Anyways enough rambling, here is my rating:  Appearance. Pours a slightly cloudy golden copper, with a 3/4 inch that kind of sticks around, but shrinks down to a 1/4 inch head.  Smell, smells of rich hops. A slightly sweet smell that I can't quite identify, maltyish maybe.  Taste: I love the unabashed onslaught of hops this beer puts fourth. Light hop flavor up front with a brutal increase upon swallowing. This is a hop lovers dream. This bad boy is hoppy and bitter, without being too bitter. Malt doesn't play a huge role in this beer other than existing in a futile attempt to try to balance out out the bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation is medium, hop content leaves a resin sensation on the tongue, and oddly enough, on my front teeth.  My concluding thoughts on this beer, are if you like hops, you will love this beer, if malty styles are your go to, or if you are into more balanced styles, this may not be for you. I always try to indicate whether or not a beer may be good for sessioning, and due to the alcohol content I cannot in good conscious recommend it, but it doesn't stop me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Holland,3.87,"A: paler than most, it's still an amber color with a large head and a slight cloudiness. Suspended hops?  S: sure smells like it. The smell is bitter, with some pale malt and tons of pine and citrus hops. I'd be willing to bet this tastes...  T: ...bitter. The hops assault the senses with the taste, and the bitterness clouds my taste of the citrus, though I get quite a bit of pine. Malt seems to be an afterthought, but it's there in the aftertaste, though the makeup of the beer is fairly...  M: medium bodied, but lighter than expected. I would mark it down for that, but the crispness and aftertaste it allows to stick on the tongue make up for it. But it didn't make up for the fact that...  O: overall, I was kind of disappointed. I know it's a huge hop bomb, and I love that, but I'd like to see a bigger malt backbone. At 7.7% and this mouthfeel, it could easily be called an IPA, not a DIPA. Compare this head to head with the likes of Sculpin and it loses. Compare it with DIPAs like Pliny the Elder, Hopslam, and Double Crooked Tree, and it's not even close. Maybe I got an old batch, so I'll review again if I see something different in it.

147,4083,BeerdedEric,4.47,"Hazy golden unfiltered body color that has a white head that fades into a creamy one. Some noticeable bubbles. Excellent lacing on the glass.  Citrus, pine and floral hops with a sweet caramel background. This smells like its going to be a treat!  Wow! The alpha acids definitely awaken the tongue. Citrus grapefruit, a noticeable spiciness, caramel in the middle and towards the end; with a sweet but bitter balance on the finish. The after taste is slightly metallic but I don't mind it.  Mouth feel is nice. Light to medium body and incredibly easy to drink for 100+ IBU's. I don't notice the boozy taste but I sure feel the warmth of it going down. The carbonation is noticeable but works with the beer.  If you're a hophead, you're wishing you had another bomber of this -- 'nough, said.  I have had this before, never reviewed it.

Piney bitterness which I quickly acclimate to, but it is fairly bitter. Citrus/pine fruitiness, but not so sweet as in the smell. Almost like unsweet pineapple. Quite nice. M: Mild carbonation, funny sort of nearly mouth puckering bitterness. Light to medium body. O: Very good, perhaps a bit too bitter for me, but the pineapple quality is very nice.

147,4083,ludachris,4.45,"Its glowing hazed apricot orange body reminds me of one of the reasons why I love well crafted IPA's so much. Just over a finger's worth of creamy white head sits at the top of my Brandy snifter, and I'm wondering if a bigger head would have been yeilded had I used a bigger glass. Oh well, I'm still a fan.  Fresh and sticky pine sap and grapefruit peel ooze out of the glass with a luscious and smooth mango puree character following close behind. The toasty, lightly sweet malts are just as fresh but not a quarter as concentrated as the hop profile. They still give balance and subltey add to the fruity sweetness of the beer while being incredibly well integrated. Wow.  Fresh but not overly sweet mango puree sweeps across the tongue before being quickly outdone by heavily concentrated pine notes. Perfume and soapiness come to mind when describing the pungency of the pine. The bitterness doesn't have the mouth puckering punch I was expecting but it sure does have the lingering power; coming in waves and in no hurry to go anywhere. Piney, herbal, and dry are what's left at the end of this fantastic IPA. Maybe a bit of fresh mint as well. Light, toasty malt lay on the outer parameters of the beer and don't take a chance at interfering with the great concentration of hops.  Medium weight to the body with a smooth and dry feel. There's a nice creaminess to it as well. The hops do well at disguising the 7.7% ABV.  I'd place this in the top 5 IPA's/IIPA's I've had to date. I love how both the piney/bitter and tropical/sweet hop characteristics are displayed and the balance achieved in this beer. It doesn't strip the enamel off of your teeth with explosive bitterness, but it does do well at giving me my hop fix. I'd take another one and six more after.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Pours an amberish goldish color with about 1cm worth of an off whitish head. It looks pretty. S-Citrusy hops dominate. I detect floral notes and even some tropical ones like pineapple and mango. T-I went into this wondering what I would get. I felt like I was sucking on a Christmas Tree. Syrupy and piney were on my palate forever. That being said though, the peppery spice flavors and some malt backbone helped to balance that out somehow. Alcohol...what alcohol? I never noticed! Kinda impressed here. I just couldn't get over the pineyness though. Took it down a notch. M-Moderately carbonated. Prickly and offers a dry finish. Medium body. Not too shabby. O-I try to be objective as possible, but honestly for this beer, one time is enough for me. I don't like the piney hoppy taste. Seems to be a popular thing in the USA but I'm just not catching on. One thing I can say is though is that this is probably the most drinkable IPA that I have ever drank. The balance was there and the other flavors made it quite refreshing. The alcohol was something I never noticed so the ABV is deceiving. Amongst the hopheads, I can understand why this beer is loved.

It is phenomenal from the nice light orange color to the wonderful citrus aroma, and finally to the outstanding smooth balance and extra dry finish in the taste.

147,4083,Pintofbrown,4.62,"Appearance – Poured into a Surly Darkness snifter. Builds to two fingers of an off-white, orangish head, looks very creamy. Good amount of lace sticking as the head falls. The body is a beautiful golden caramel that is completely opaque. There are some darker amber highlights.  Smell- What an incredible array of hop scents in here, and really powerful. It is mostly citrus that comes through, but not a sour citrus. There is a lot of sweet in here. Pineapple, tangerine, and a little bit of grassy hop to go with. Behind that there is slight sense of pine. Very well done, it is the sweetness in the hop that makes this great.  Taste- The hops in here are similar to what is on the nose. There is the slight sweetness of pineapple, but there is much more tangerine and lemon in the drink. The finish is long, and of course, gloriously bitter. A little more orange comes out near the finish, and so does that resiny, pine hop. Mid drink and beyond however, is still dominated by those sweet citrusy hop profiles. What surprises me is the buried biscuit malt. Once the finish is about done bouncing around, the malt does just come through.  Mouth feel- Medium bodied and pretty slick, there isn’t really any carbonation to speak of here. And that is just fine. A well crafted beer is showing its colors.  Overall- Really just an excellent IPA. I’m not sure I will find an IPA that could be anymore well crafted. The taste profiles are great, but not as much sweetness in the drink as on the nose. Really though, a very minor critique of an awesome IPA. Did I mention that you should drink this? Now? Yeah.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Nose is so tropical and citric, just a very mouth-watering aroma. So fresh and bursting, perfect hop aroma.  Malts are kept light but are still noticeable, biscuity and lightly toasted with almost an earthy English graininess. Hop flavor and bittering are both huge; the bitterness lingers on the palate forever. Hop flavors range from pithy orange peels to lemon flesh to bubblegum weed and even range into the minty realm now and again. Big flavors here, I think this could actually benefit from some more alcohol to throw out and accent some tropical flavors in the beer. Bitterness is a bit too over the top for me, I wouldnt mind a brighter hop flavor with a tad less bitterness. Still though, minor complaints here and I think this is an excellent DIPA and one of the fore-runners of the style, Stone should most certainly be commended for that.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,uawildcat,4.62,Poured with a large white fluffy head with some staying power. Leaves plenty of nice lacing behind.  Other than the appearance of the beer the first thing that you notice is the intense citrusy hops smell permeating through the room. Upon sticking your nose in the glass there is a nice floral honey sweetness and citrusy hoppiness.  Sipping this beer is a heavenly experience. There is a beautiful balance between sweetness and bitterness. To be honest I was afraid that the balance would be off. Up front it hits you with the floral honey sweetness that gives way to a grapefruit like hoppiness that lingers and coats the mouth with the oily hopiness. This beer goes down quite easy. Defiantly full bodied and creamy.  This is a beer that I can see myself coming back to. This is better than the Stone IPA in my opinion.

Oh the aroma on this one, big citrus notes lead the way followed with some nice hop aromas balanced by some pine notes some sweeter honey and alcoholic sweetness. The flavors are bold as usual, bitter hoppy flavors, some grassy and vegetable flavors with tart yet smooth citrus at the finish. It’s got a great body, perfectly carbonated and super smooth.  Verdict: Really nice double IPA, I don’t usually care for the more earthy and grassy IPAs but this one is pretty darn tasty. Another solid brew from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,dbmernin83,4.32,"Pours a glowing straw yellow with an inch and a half head after a hearty pour. Huge hops. Very citrusy. Mangos. Smells amazing. Not as bitter as you would think. Don't get me wrong, this is a big IPA, but the grapefruit and mangos come through to give a touch of fruity sweetness to dance with the hops. A touch of alcohol adds to it. On the lighter side of DIPAs. This o's a fantastic one. Nice to have an IPA that destroys your palate with detail and nuances. Sorta ironic.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Ruger,4.25,"A - Pours a slightly clear copper color with a cream colored one finger head with moderate lacing.  S - Starts off with really strong pine and finishes with crisp citrus.  T - Really big bitterness upfront with a syrup like pine that sticks all around my mouth, and finishes with citrus tinge, the bitterness slowly fades away and leaves the mouth after it is swallowed, leaving a pleasant aftertaste I really love the taste.  M - Extremely smooth, with the perfect amount of carbonation with a medium mouthfeel.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,nhindian,4.07,"12oz bottle poured into a Stone Old Guardian glass.  A - Pours a pale, straw yellow with a bit of orange to it. It's a little cloudy, but it's actually more clear than I was expecting it to be. About a finger and half of cream-colored head, rocky and porous in shape, with pretty good retention. The lacing is nice as well, with a generous sheet of foam coating the glass.  S - The nose is all hops, mainly freshly squeezed citrus, but also some sticky pine cones as well. Very floral and aromatic and it seeps out of the glass to fill the area with it's bouquet. Lots of grapefruit and especially orange rind. While there is a lot of hop, it isn't overly bitter or astringent, but rather more clean which makes it all the more appetizing. Just a hint of toffee in the malts.  T - All hops, all day. This is an experiment in hop extremity and it comes across in spades in the flavor. It starts with just the slightest of malt backbones to give a sweet caramel note, but from there the hops run away with the taste. Mainly bitter citrus with a big tropical and orange taste. Again, there is some pine and floral notes, but it's mostly fruity. Bitter finish, but not a whole lot of alcohol, thankfully.  M - Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with lowish carbonation. Not syrupy, but would like a little more zest. Long-lasting bitter aftertaste that really does ruin the palate. Even still, it is pretty smooth.  D/O - Drinkability is moderately high. It's hard to call a beer of this magnitude and hop profile very drinkability, but it is bursting with flavor that keeps going with every sip. Even with the strong bitterness, I found myself reaching for the glass again and again and looking forward to it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,CheezyBlaster,4.2,"Just lovely. I love how big and sudsy these things can be.  *Sniff, sniff* Clean, astringent hops, but malty sweets and sneaky fruits make themselves heard, and become more present as you drink.  This tastes like a lot of those West Coast tongue-wreckers, but with actual malt, quiet but present. Bitter citrus and pine is obvious, as expected, but it's wonderfully constructed. Less ruinous than the artists at Stone let on -at least compared to other brutal and, dare I say, overhopped West Coasters. This thing is still loaded enough for hop-heads, but has a great, malty-sweet whisper that even comes out in the finish with a little toast.  Drink it, I like it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S: Grapefruit, peach and rose-- very nice.  T: Starts with sweet rose, ends with bitter grapefruit. Slightly sweet aftertaste. Very nice flavor. After the first few sips, bitter finish becomes more prominent, but always stays balanced. Delicious.  M: Light, very creamy.  O: One of the best IPAs, no doubt. Get some, you'll be glad you did.

147,4083,FreshHawk,4.32,"A - Light orange color with an average sized, fluffy, light, foamy, sticky, white head. Good retention leaving a sticky layer of lace.  S - Lots of citrus hops along with a good amount of floral and pine aroma. There is a definite malt base with caramel and bready aroma. Definite touches of sweetness and bitterness but nothing overpowering.  T - Very hoppy on the tongue as well. Sweet citrus, touches of tropical fruit and floral hops. Some pine resin as well. Touches of bitterness. Sweet caramel and bready malt provide a backbone but it has no chance of overtaking the hops. Provide a sweetness that prevent any lingering bitterness.  M - Medium to full body with average to slightly below average carbonation. Fairly sticky and syrupy.  D - Not too bitter or sweet but it is a bit cloying. Tasty but I can't really see myself drinking much of this in one sitting.  Notes: Pretty good DIPA. A good amount of hops providing for a pretty tasty beer. Pretty well balanced between sweetness and bitterness and it has a nice malt backbone. It is a touch cloying however.

147,4083,BeerCon5,4.08,"Pours a cloudy amber color with two fingers of firm fluffy head that remains throughout the beer.  The scent is of floral hops and citrus.  The taste is very dry floral hops, toasted bready malt, citrus, noticeable alcohol.  Medium body, smoothy, creamy and a bit resiny, moderate carbonation.  This was a very flavorful beer, pretty easy to drink also. I would definitely drink this again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,TheAlamoWrocker,4.11,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle, best consumed by October 3 of 2011, into a Blue Star Brewery Pint Glass.  Appearance  On the pour it reminds me of what I good IPA is supposed to look like. The color is roughly a goldenrod to a tawny. The head was a decent one finger on the pour and a slight head still remains on it. It looks like lacing will be nice on this IPA as well. The cloudiness that this IPA has for its color is amazing.  Smell  The smell is mostly honey with a obvious floral presence. A very light alcoholic smell is on this, but it seems as if this is going to be more sweet than alcoholic though.  Taste  The taste is definitely of a strong citrus variety which most taste like grapefruit. I want to say it taste alcoholic, but it's not instead it's just strong and powerful. The hops are strong and lasting, but I wish this had more to it. The hoppy aftertaste definitely stays on the tongue and it's a nice reminder to myself that I'm drinking a nice beer. There's a slight pine taste to this drink, but I think a regular Stone IPA lets more get through.  Mouthfeel  The body is of a medium quality and so is the carbonation. The body is not simple, but it's also far from complex. This holds a nice aftertaste for a long time, but it's just a hoppy aftertaste and nothing more.  Overall  This is a really good IPA. The sad thing is that I feel that the regular Stone IPA had more flavor. Ruination feels as if it sacrificed deeper flavors for bitterness. If you love pure bitterness then this is a nice choice for you, but I feel as if I am just going to stick with a regular Stone IPA as my first choice.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BeerNutz324,4.32,"22 oz. bomber split with the wifey into 2 pint glasses  Ap- a clear light amber in color with a really good head that pours to almost a 1.5 inch. The head has amazing retention (I poured it like 10 minutes ago). Great lacing too.  Ar- all I really smell is citrus fruits like grapefruit and orange and lots and lots of piney hops. I get a little whiff of alcohol towards the very end of the sniff as well.  T- very smooth. For being 104 IBU it is not overwhelming. A nice fruity taste lingers at the end of a lot of hop flavor. I love the oily hop flavor that gets stuck in your mouth afterwards.  M- perfect on the tongue. Decent carbonation too.  O- great DIPA. I really liked the citrus notes that came at the very end of the taste. It does tend to ruin your palatte though, which is what we asked for when buying this stuff anyway. I wonder what a full bomber would have done?",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,TheBeerCarl,4.43,"Appearance: Beautiful clear amber color with a thick white head that seems to never dissipate. Looks exactly the way an IPA should look.  Smell: Wonderful bouquet of citrus and piney hops with some malt character coming through towards the end. The citrus is by far and away the most present smell though.  Taste: A nice balance of hoppy bitterness, piney earthy notes as well as some citrus, and a finish of malty caramel sweetness. The hop character lingers on the tongue the way an IPA should.  Mouthfeel: Not a lot of carbonation bite but yet not very smooth either. The beer could definitely use some work in this department.  This is definitely an IPA that has made it into my everyday enjoyment. Stone has created a really nice IPA and the price is right.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,DrewV,4.15,"A: Hazy orangy-yellow color with a solid 2-finger white head. Lacing clings to the glass from start to finish.  S: Grassy, piney, skunky hops fill the nose. Not much balance from the malts in the aroma.  T: Pale ale all the way. Bright, citrusy hops with a ton of malt to back it up. But the malts never take over, as the bitter hops dominate from start to finish. Not a one-trick pony, however, as the flavor never really gets boring.  M: Low- to medium carbonation keeps it all together. Crisp and dry, not much creaminess here.  O: A solid DIPA. I don't get the sense that this is 100+ IBUs. Bitter, for sure, but not puckering. The malts, as minor a player as they are, maintain a decent balance but don't really affect the flavor that much. A good DIPA, but not sure it's worth the price tag. A solid B+/A- in my book.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,nrs207,4.25,"Overall, it was pretty solid in every respect. Gave a good hazy appearance with a good head.  The smell was strong with hops, mostly citrus. I couldn't discern too much else.  The taste was very good, if you like being assaulted by hops. I do, so I found it to be very enjoyable, but found the hops dominated the taste. It does indeed ruin your palate. I finished it about 30 minutes ago and my mouth still has not recovered. Highly recommended if you want a hop bomb, but not if you want something more mild.  The mouthfeel was pretty smooth. Carbonated to the correct level. Really woke up the taste buds.  Overall, I would say definitely try this if you're looking for a hoppy beer. I'd be hard pressed to say if this or Hopsickle by Moylan is my favorite extremely hoppy beer right now, but both deserve a try for a true hop head. Definitely give it a try if you like strong IPAs and you can find it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

If you're looking for a counterpoint, move along...  A) Good color and good lacing, without getting a ""sudsy"" appearance some other IPAs pick up.  S) Really strong smell of hops at first, which overpowers everything at first. Once you start drinking it, though, the smell of rich pine comes through, and really complements the taste.  T) Well, bitter, but I don't find it overpowering at all (I actually find the taste to be less bitter than the 90-minute IPA from Dogfish Head...maybe due to overload?). Somewhat fruity and citrus-y...I almost want an orange slice to finish it out.  M) Surprisingly, there is a very light feel (and aftertaste) to this beer.  Overall, very enjoyable.

147,4083,Groomsy,4.38,"Bomber with ""Enjoy by"" date of 11.10.11. Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint. (Sorry, don't have a tulip...)  Appearance: Radiant golden orange body with a firm and sticky head of bright white foam. Body is fairly clear with just a bit of haze in there. Carbonation jets up to the top of the glass. This head never fully goes away and leaves massive strings of lacing behind, stubborn and unmoving. Incredible looking beer.  Aroma: West Coast to the core. Huge notes of citrus fruits, including but not limited to grapefruit, orange, lemon, pineapple, and who knows what else. Big notes of bitter pine as well. Backbone of firm caramel malt. Maybe a little sweeter than I expected, but incredible smelling no less. No alcohol noticeable.  Taste: Big bitter pine and grapefruit on the front, very sharp and citrusy. Bracing bitterness endures throughout. There's a malt sweetness, very caramel-like in taste, that comes in mid-palate. More malt sweetness, bready flavors, emerge as the beer warms. The finish on this is ridiculously bitter, with floral and pine notes merging together for an extremely bitter but satisfying finish with hints of alcohol. Not for the faint of heart. Take this slowly.  Mouthfeel: Surprisingly smooth with a good carbonation kick. Full, rich body. With so much hop resin and oil, the finish is sticky and dry, with flavors of pine and floral hops sticking around for what seems like ages.  Overall: More than enough for your hop fix. The taste of hops will linger in your mouth for... a really long time. Even as brash and bitter as this is, it's still very well balanced. A great achievement from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Mouthfeel medium bodied, warm, and smooth.  A solid IPA. All around balanced, well hopped, and drinkable. The bottle claims 100+ IBUs, but in my opinion it's not overly bitter.

Grapefruit with pine. Has some orange peel/zest that comes out of the hop bitterness. There is a decent amount of malts to this brew but its overshadowed by the bouquet of hops.  (M) Medium bodied, bold, and bitter. Oily on the tongue.  (O) Really solid DIPA.

Very slight piney taste.  M) Thin spicy up front and slightly bitter in the back, not sticky, no bitter aftertaste.  O) I'm a fan of this IPA. A lot less hop profile from their regular IPA and a lot more balanced. If you're looking for super hoppy go with something else. A well-balanced IPA.

Some nice cloudiness in this pumpkin colored brew.  Inhaling deeply gives way to tropical fruits, alpha hops, some malty and breadiness there as well.  This beer is wonderful, I get fresh hops, tropical fruit like grapefruit and pineapple, some yeasty bread flavor and some malty sweetness that's balanced very well with the piney alpha hoppiness. This well balanced IPA is not as bitter as some of the Stone brews, but its very well done in my opinion.

Taste is also a bit sweeter than I expected but has a very smooth pine hop finish that is not over powering. The hoppyness also does not linger for tooo long on the palate like similar IPAs.

147,4083,BeerNoobNC,5,"Had on-tap at Brewery Night at Flying Saucer in Raleigh.  I have seen the beer under the IPA and double IPA categories. To me, it did seem like a borderline beer that could easily go under either category. The beer definitely has more hoppiness to it than some normal IPAs. However, the hops did not completely dominate the taste of the beer like some other Double IPAs that I have had. There was a very complex array of tastes that you get in every regular IPA, but it seemed to have that much more flavor to balance well with the hops. That is why, in my opinion, it is probably the best IPA I have ever had. Not to mention, I got a sweet pint glass with it.

S - Mild aromas of tropical fruit, lemon grass, biscuit and floral hops.  T - Hop forward, then corn bread with a lemon-caramel glaze followed by bright citrus bitterness and some pine. The aftertaste is delicious combining citrus sweetness and deep bitterness that lasts and lasts.  M - Light-medium body and medium carbonation. Very prickly and resinous; just how I like it.  D - I never get tired of this brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,TenHornsProud,4.17,"Pours a light copper with a big white head that laces nicely.  Smells dank, piney, slight citrus notes. Smells like weed.  Tastes of bready malt up front that is hit with bitterness and morphs into resinous, earthy hops, and finishes with a big hop, bitter kick. A real hop attack in the best way.  Mouthfeel is nice, medium bodied with medium to high carbonation. The beer is silky smooth. It goes down easy and the booze is well hidden.  A great DIPA that has a dank, pine overtone and is smooth but packs quite the bitter, hop punch.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,tito42,4.48,"Poured from bottle to a Blvd. Smokestack tulip. Best by 08/04/2011, so I'm nearly four weeks beyond this. The Bros. say not to worry based on the hops and alcohol levels in this brew.  A: Unfiltered and deep saffron in color. A frothy white head leaves thick, clumpy lace. Outstanding curb appeal.  S: Extremely pungent aroma of piney, resinous hops. Grapefruit and a floral scent also present.  T: Wow, lots of hops bitterness here, but it didn't hit me over the head as I had imagined. A very strong malt backbone balances the resinous hops and allows some grapefruit and pineapple citrus to come through. I also taste tea. A bit of pepper at the finish. A decidedly hoppy finish that lingers on the back of the tongue, but doesn't necessarily rip the front off. Very well balanced and intricate.  M: Very smooth, medium-bodied. Obviously, a lingering hops bitterness on the palate. The alcohol is present but masked well for 7.7 ABV.  O: Very, very good double IPA. I think I prefer this over Hopslam. I need to find Pliny somehow.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Guden,3.06,"A- A very pretty, sparkly gold and perfectly clear showing lots of little carbonation bubbles. A 2 inch head which holds for what seems like forever and leaves big layers of lacing.  S- Huge hops hiding anything else. Pine and citrus stands out with some notes of fruit peel and sugar.  T- Big pininess with moderate hop bitterness throughout and a big bitter bite at the end. There's a hint of malt backbone and alcohol but its mostly lost. Not very well balanced and overly bitter even for the style.  M- Very thin with high carbonation that adds to the biting bitterness.  D- With the carbonic acid and alpha acids tag teaming the tongue it is just too much. It is interesting and strong, but not something I would want again for a while, if ever.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,LiquidCucumber,4.3,"Been wanting to review the granddaddy of the style for a while now. Finally came upon a very fresh bottle.  A - Pours light amber, almost straw with three fingers of white foam afloat the top.  S - Juicy, piney, resin-filled hops. Getting quite a bit of citrus as well. I want to stick my nose into it; I may just have done so. Some malt is definitely there, but is not too prominent.  T - Sweet succulent hops hit your palate and give way to huge bitterness. Lots of fruit like citrus and mango as well as pine and resinous earth. Delish.  M - Fairly light in body but this one isn't huge on the malts like many others of the style are. The hop prickle remains on my tongue for quite some time.  O - I do very much enjoy this beer and hugely respect it. I often do find it out of date on the shelves; and that is a shame. I have heard the brewery is attempting to rectify this but I think it is probably more of a distributor problem than anything.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,dcook11,4.75,"Poured into a tulip.  A- Honey colored. High carbonation. 2 finger head. Sticky lacing. Clear. Resembles elder.  S- Very sweet. Heavy caramel odor melded perfectly with tropical fruits and hops. Also get some brown sugar.  T- Very hoppy, but balanced and drinkable. Pine and citrus hops blended nicely. Also a touch of caramel.  M- Heavy.  O- One of my favorite IPAs. I thought this was going to be a novelty beer, but definitly not. Well balanced and probably going to be my regular go to IIPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ncfranklin,4.18,"22oz Bomber into a Duvel Tulip  A: Golden orange with a finger off-white head. Quite murky, but a gorgeous color.  S: Pine, citrus of orange and lemon, all around hop. Pretty strong in the nose, no malt detected.  T: Very, very bitter. Those IBU's are well represented. Orange and lemon citrus, some of the pine notes, overall resinous hop oils. A slight butter sweetness underneath, but it's very hidden.  M: Deliciously full, with a creamy quality. Not much of a crisp carbonation bite however.  D: It's a definitive hop experience, not a ""balanced"" imperial IPA (Tho at 7.7%, it's not as huge as some others naymore). Must try from Stone, as always.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,wnh,4.03,"12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip.  Pours a bright, brilliant clear copper-amber color topped by a frothy off-white head.  Big and hoppy nose, of course. Grapefruit peel, honey, and warm alcohol notes permeate. A fair bit spicy and spiced, faintly berry-like and floral. Fresh and inviting. I'm a bit surprised by the clarity of the alcohol in a beer this relatively low in ABV.  Not the assault on the palate I was expecting. Rather balanced and almost mild. Hops impart a definite bitterness and a distinct chile-like hot spiciness, even a bit vegetal. A bit floral again, with a subtle base of caramel malt. Otherwise this isn't as dense and flavorful as I was expecting. Mild, but not bland.  Medium to fullish in body, mostly soft. Rounded and dangerously drinkable. Not an in-your-face double IPA, but kudos to Stone for making a palatably approachable version (regardless of what the text on the bottle may say).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mattboyer182,4.2,A - Pours a golden color with a thick white foamy head.  S - A decent hop smell. Not overpowering though. Smells a little citrusy and piney.  T - Obviously very bitter. But interestingly enough it more balanced than what I thought. There is still a creamy malt profile.  M - Fairly thick creamy mouth feel. I would say medium body with about the same for carbonation.  O - overall great for what it is. There's just a lot better ipa's out there.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,AdamBear,4.5,"A-cloudy amber with a sticky cream colored head  S-smells so good! great citrusy hops! good strength. fairly sweet  T-comes in with a great taste of orange peel, hops, and some sweet grains. its a really creamy and sweet taste with a good amount of bitterness that follows. there's a yummy matching after-taste. this beer is quite a relief to drink after having some really mediocre IPAs.  M-medium creamy carbonation with a creamy finish  O-this was very good and drinkable. i loved the creaminess and drinkability this is an IPA that will not disappoint! i could have this all night long!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BJA,4.15,"Poured from 12oz bottle into perfect pint glass.  A: The appears as a crisp, clear golden color with carbonation bubbles steadily rising to the head. I got a solid two finger head. The head is a creamy, slightly off white color and started to dissipate after about one minute. A nice little cap remained and a lot of thick lacing was left on the glass.  S: Smells like hops: dank, resinous hops with a slightly floral and piney scent in there. It is a pungent smell.  T: Tastes like hops. I get a little less of the dank, resiny taste compared to the scent. There are herbal, grassy, piney notes. I also get a little citrus and spice flavor. Oh yeah, and it is bitter. Obviously this beer is built with a hop dominance in mind. It succeeds smashingly in that regard.  M: I think this beer has a medium mouthfeel, but the hops tend to explode on your palate just after you take a sip. The hops leave a strong aftertaste on your tongue and, particularly for me, on the roof of your mouth.  O: I think this beer accomplishes what it sets out to do: fill your mouth with hops. I really like hoppy beers that have their own character and this beer has that. It has the Stone taste with incredible hoppiness. It is right up there with some of the other crazy hopped San Diego IPAs that I drink a lot in this wonderful beer city. I wish I had the ability to describe all the nuanced flavors better. I like these beers because they turn out to be great sipping beers. You really have to like hops to get through one of these though. If you do appreciate hops, you will like this beer, along with the other crazy hopped west coast IPAs. When you spend time with them, you find they have a lot of nuance to them beyond the crazy hops. That is nice. The one thing I don’t like about the Ruination IPA is the aftertaste. It really lingers on the roof of my mouth in a bitter way. I suppose it is just ruining my palate.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,logmacschlog15,4.12,"Bottle to Dogfish snifter.  A: Pours about one finger of white foam that dissapates rather quickly leaving behind a thin layer of head. A deep and hazy amber with tinges of orange. Very few CO2 bubbles.  S: A fragrant bouquet of grapefruit, pear, and mango notes as well as some more sublte spicey, piney notes from the hops. There is a fairly good amount of caramel malt sweetnesss coming through the hop aromas as well.  T: A wave of citrus and tropical fruits hits the tounge but slowly recedes producing some very deep piney undertones as well as a huge kick of bitterness. This is all built on a backbone of sweet caramel malts and a slight biscuty note as well.  M: Medium bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and a somewhat dry finish.  O: This is a really great beer if you're a hophead! Surprisingly though, the hoppy goodness also allows some of the malty backbone to shine through. Really, really good offering from Stone. Wish I could try one SUPER fresh on tap at the brewery!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,DTJPPR,4.73,"From tasting notes combined in March and August 2011  A - This pours a beautiful burnt-orangish/copper color that makes you just want to throw it down your gullet. It is free of any clouding, and is clear despite its darkness. Leaves a decent 1-1.5 Finger head that fades somewhat fast leaving small traces of a fine lacing.  S - Not as strong of a hoppy smell as you might have thought. There's a piney scent that seems to linger the nose underneath the citrusy hop smells. Overall it smells very earthy, like walking through a hot Orange Orchard in Summer.  T - This is where things get fun. There's an upfront citrus pleasure that fades swiftly into a punch of warming bitterness. There's an intense hop flavor here that is remarkably complex in the mixture of flavors. With an exhale, the tree-barkesqueness/pine flavors come through along with more of the fermented orange flavors in a nice swirling mixture. This is a fantastic fruity/earthy IPA. Definitely delivers on its promise of strong hoppy flavor and a nice lingering bitterness.  M - Smooth and easy to pass, much like its appearance would suggest. Not quite watery, but close. The bitterness lingers after the swallow, which is nice with the flavors it leaves.  O - This has become one of my favorite's from Stone, and has become a real staple in my beer fridge. I can always count on being satisfied, especially if I only have time for a single pint of it. Give it a try.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,nitro0292,4.18,"12 oz bottle, best by 9/28/11. Thank you Stone for putting a best by date on your bottles.  Easy pour produced 2 fingers' worth of bright white foamy head. Beautiful golden color with slight haze. Excellent retention, the head never fully disappeared. Left gobs of lacing.  Smell was all hops (just what I want when I have any kind of IPA). Wonderful citrus, pine and earth.  Taste was actually a touch sweeter than I expected, given the 100+ IBUs on the label, but then again this is a bottle that will be past expiration in a little over a month from now. Still very good, with a nice balance of hop flavor, malts and bitterness. Bitterness lingers on the tongue after each swallow.  Mouthfeel is very good, medium body, but not slick or syrupy with just the right amount of carbonation.  Overall, this is one of the best DIPAs I have had. If this were more fresh, it might very well be the best.  Drink it as often as you can.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Floral, citrus, lemon, fresh cut grass mixed with earthy notes.  Tastes of sweet sugary crystal malts, earthy hops, quite grassy. The alcohol is very well masked.  Mouthfeel is medium full bodied, medium carbonation. The finish is very oily and coating. A solid lingering bitterness remains along with the oily slickness of the hop oils.

Pine, grapefruit, tangerine, a little caramel.  T: Wave upon wave of grapefruit bitterness! You can sense some sweetness there but each time it seems like it's rising to the forefront, it is obliterated by the bitterness.  M: Medium-full body, fairly sticky; carbonation level is maybe a little higher than I'd like.  D: For a palate wrecker, drinkability is very high. The alcohol is well hidden behind the hoppy onslaught.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S- as advertised, hops punch you in the face with the first wif. Smells like an open bag of fresh whole hops just about to be added to the brew kettle. Impressive.  T - made for the hop head. Awesome resiny bitterness in the finish. Light malt character. My wife swears that she tastes something like soap. I'm not sure how to describe that. Alcohol is masked well for a beer over 7%.

147,4083,STKPICR0720,4.5,This brew was awesome from the moment I popped the top. I poured this brew from a bomber into a snifter. It poured a light blond hue and first and foremost you are introduced to the hops and pine in your face. At 100ibu's which I do believe is an understatement this brew is highly drinkable. allthough this beer did seem to rip the enamel from my teeth I will most definitly seek out and drink over and over. This brew was great.  Cheers,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,sdmvd6,4.05,"A - Transparent straw color with about a finger and a half of fluffy, white head that mostly dissipates. Light lacing is left behind.  S - Nice dominant hop bitterness up front with a hint of pine. Aromas of citrus (grapefruit and orange) and other (mangoes and dried apricots) fruits quickly take over with subtle bready undertones.  T - Similar to the nose, hop bitterness hits you up front intertwined with pine, citrus, and tropical fruit notes. Grapefruit and mango are very apparent. Toasty malt provides a balancing backdrop for these sweet and bitter flavors.  M - Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Definite hop resin as well. Very nice for this style.  O - This is such a solid DIPA. One of the first ever brewed, it truly captures the style wonderfully. Due to the fact that I bought it in MO, all of the bottles at the bottle shop had a best by date of 8-10, so I am not able to experience its full potential. It is amazing that this IPA still impresses me this much with as much age as it has.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,paxchristi,4.88,"This is one badass beer, yo!  This beer is exemplary in every facet of my experience. In fact, I sit here and crave simply thinking about pouring this beer. I poured the beer from a 22oz. bomber bottle into a chilled glass mug. It was like taking it straight from the tap; which happens less often, in my opinion, when pouring from a bottle. It had a kick-ass head that left an intense lacing down the glass and would sustain longer than the life of most beers I’ve ever had. It was a very frothy head (my favorite) that took on a vivid orange hue. I took one smell of it and I thought to myself, “HOPS!” To complement the hops, there were some very citrusy smells to it. At times it I caught hints of a premium tobacco shop. It was intensely aromatic. The taste is a medium body with am almost silky feel in the mouth. The malt seems to complement the hops very well, as it is a very soft malt roast. The third character are the rest of the undertones of piney, citrusy, and woodsy flavors. The alcoholic esters add to the flavor some real pungency. It finishes dry. Overall, this is one of my favorite IPAs (top 10 or so). Its a special beer. Whenever I have the money, I will get this again. Hopefully, I find it on tap in the city (Saint Louis).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,xdopiex,4.85,"Bottle into a tulip glass.  Single finger head that dissipated relatively quickly, little to no lacing. Pour is a bit hazy, with an light orange amber color. Nose has a sweet raisin essence. Front end is pretty sweet as well, and quickly gives way to an intense hop flavor. Theres an initial bite, which peaks and resides relatively quickly, and then a lingering backend that latches onto the back of your tongue like there is no tomorrow.  This definitely changes how you judge an IPA, as many do not seem to match the bitterness this monster brings. The other IPA from even seems very much toned down compared to this big brother.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Klym,4.3,"Had on-tap at local burger joint.  Despite having lived near stone and having noted the famousness of this beer among IPA/DIPA lovers, I hadn't tried this until the other night. The beer was beautiful in the glass with carbonation vigorously dancing throughout the body the entire drink and awesome retention of a 1 finger head. Both the nose and taste were a bitterness formed through citrus rind and herbal hop character, on top of a pineapple dominant tropical fruit shaved ice flavor. It drank beautifully at all temperatures with an enormously crisp mouthfeel and plenty of nicely incorporated carbonation. Wonderful hop bomb that never became medicinal or chemical in nature. Great beer from stone for sure.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,antlerwrestler19,4.07,"Pours slightly orange/amber with quite a haze to it - two finger thick white frothy head fell pretty slowly to leave a mellow head and a lot of thick spotty lacing. Smells up front of sweet mango and orange accompanied by a nice piney bit - very inviting. The taste is of sweet and resinous hops - fruity, tangy, piney - with a nice balance from a mellow caramely malt flavor. This beer is nicely carbonated and leaves a sticky resinous feeling with a faint burn of alcohol at the back of the tongue. This is a very solid beer, sipping on it slowly so as to enjoy every bit - it's an ideal IPA for me and I'm glad I grabbed the last two bottles at the bottle shop I visited in Baxter, MN.

Let it sit for a few minutes to warm  A - Nice Hazy Orange, amber-ish, cant quite see through it. 2.5 fingers of white frothy head. Excellent lacing.  S - Hops, Pine right off the bat. As it warms, the malty, caramel notes come through  T - Bitter is the first thing that comes, followed by a sweet malti-ness that follows. The malts don't cancel out the hops fully, but I'm sure that's by design. Finish is alcohol warming and lingering bitterness. Malts are more prevalent as it warms.  M - Great mouthfeel, silky smooth.  Overall excellent IPA, a little more hoppy than I prefer but darn good, highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,BaronRogue,4.42,"Pours a hazed yellow to amber as the glass filled.  Not as aromatic or overwhelming as the bottle would lead me to believe, but impressive. Fruity resin, sweet but not too sweet. Wish it was stronger, must smell amazing on tap.  Tastes as good as it smells, if not better. Each sip gives you a new experience, I noticed something new every time. Complex and downright tasty. Fiercely bitter upon swallowing, but I could handle the 100 IBUs with relative ease, to my own surprise. Try as I might to detect the malt, the hops wouldn't let me.  The taste lingers long after the swallow, just makes you sit back and enjoy it, yet yearn for another taste.  Solid in the mouth, pressing your tongue against your hard palate results in a creamy foam and releases even more flavor. Carbonated enough to give it some bite.  Overall, I must say I believe the hype. I was worried that it was a novelty beer that was hoppy for hops sake, but really it's deliciously well crafted, will try again, hopefully on tap.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S: HOPS, piney, fruity, resiny.... loads of hops. It's almost intoxicating.  T: Somehow a well balanced flavor coming from this hop bomb of a beer... Piney and fruity hops hit you first but then give way to a delicious malt character that compliments the hops perfectly. The finish is a mix of alcohol and resiny hop flavor. It tastes like I've been chewing on a hop cone. The finish is what makes this beer for me, it's so f'ing good.  M: Medium body, slightly creamy, slightly dry finish.  O: I got into craft beer with this being the holy grail of IPA's. Since then, and since getting a job at a liquor store with lots of crafts, everyone at work talks shit on Stone, and it doesn't sell very well, so I haven't bought it in a while, since most of our Stone products are out of date or on the verge.

147,4083,jondeelee,4.92,"Stone's Ruination IPA begins with the kind of hoppy aroma that can be detected a good distance from the actual beverage, letting you know you're in for some powerful bitterness. Up close, the effect is even more pronounced, with huge grapefruit rind and pine sap swirls almost tinging the air green. Beneath these is an obviously equally-impressive layer of malts, since the sugars (brown, with strong hints of toast and biscuit) manage to still make themselves known despite the hops.  On the tongue, the beer begins with hops, which literally assault the tastebuds and soft palate with pine, grapefruit, rosewater, and small threads of eucalyptus, leaving a noticeable buzzing feeling on the tongue when held there for a few seconds. Despite the 100+ IBUs, the hops are still well-balanced, and haven't sacrificed flavor for bitterness, which happens with lesser-quality IPAs. As well, there are, again, an equally-strong layer of malts in here, which bring apricot and berry fruit esters to the mix, as well as strong brown sugars and Grape Nuts cereal overtones, providing a nice counter to the hops. The aftertaste is a long, lingering hop parade, which does become more and more bitter as the sugars die off, and ends up tasting like dandelion stems. Mouthfeel is a creamy medium, and carbonation is medium.  Overall, only a few sips of this reveals why the label claims this has an ""immediate ruinous effect on your palate"": after this many IBUs, it's doubtful that any other beer is going to have much flavor at all. But since the beer is this delicious, and a bomber clocks in at 7.7% ABV, you might not need another one anyway.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ummswimmin,4.45,"Oh beautiful IPA. I relish this amazing beer. Stone defines HOPPINESS, I love this.  The color and head is perfect. The lacing was really nice on the glass.  I like the smell and taste of the hops. It is a great example of a west coast ipa. Thank you Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,machostacos,4.7,"It's not often I review a beer with 4.5's (with a 5.0 squeaking its way in) across the board...but anyway, here we go.  Poured into my favorite tulip glass from a 22oz bomber dated 9/20/11. Nice.  A: Pours a slightly cloudy (hey, it's unfiltered after all) amber with an inch or so of head that shows impressive staying power. Looks gorgeous in a tulip. Nice thick lacing.  S: Wow. This puts a big smile on my face, and confirms that I am an official Hop Head. Huge aroma of hops, hops, and more hops. Imposing, dank, sweet-yet-insulting, grapefruity, piney, resinous, ridiculous. The sweetness of the malts barely cuts through the fog of hop aroma, but it's there in an attempt at balance. This, my friends, is what a DIPA is all about.  T: Again, wow. And again, a big smile. Forget the beer, let me just gnaw on some hops! This beer has an incredible flavor - it's sweet and tangy and bitter and sweet again and bitter and full and oppressive. I can't say I've tasted anything like it, and I've had my fair share of DIPAs. It's exquisitely balanced. The 100+ IBUs are evident yet surprisingly managed. Just incredible.  M: Nice and full. Quite oily and coating. The bitterness is incredible, and yet very managed. This beer is one perfectly-balanced SOB.  O: This is one helluva beer. It's got everything - mind-blowing hoppiness, an understated-yet-somewhat-balancing malt backbone, and an aroma that makes me wish they made candles out of this stuff. At 7.7% it's practically a lightweight in DIPA territory, and yet it stands toe-to-toe with some of the greats. Stone has practical perfection on its hands, 8 years (at least) running. Bravo, Stone. Bravo.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,huhl23,4.7,"This beer poured a nice reddish orange color and formed a nice bubbly off white head and left some nice bubbly circular lace. A decent amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of hops, citrus and some floral aspects. The flavor is of hops and citrus with a slight hint of herb. The finish is light and just a touch bitter and extremely astrigent. Great beer but a beer you probably want to drink at the end of the night unless you don't want to taste any other beers the rest of the night.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,azdback,4.47,"Poured into my Stone Imperial glass. Beautiful, light orange, semi-cloudy appearance. Head is a small two fingers and bright white in color and quite creamy looking. Lace was almost a solid sheet of beauty.  Smell is peel your face off citrus hops. Lots of bright citrus smells. Lemon, lime, yellow grapefruit and pineapple. Some alcohol is there too.  Taste is ultra bitter. Lemon tart pucker with some sweetness from an orange or pineapple. Some alcohol burn late in the throat. Tongue is incapable of much more.  Mouth is huge. Very full and even though my tongue is wrecked I can still say the flavors and carbonation are there to the end.  Overall I have had this many times in the past but have never had a chance to review it. I must say that this is my favorite example of a huge West Coast IPA (or double). It's name says it all. Not everyone in the US is okay with this huge West Coast style, but I call all of those that can't handle a ruined pallet a big fat wimp! Cheers to all of us that do! A must try! I also must commend Stone for freshness dating their bottles now. This one was dated 08/21/11. Maybe the freshest I've ever had???",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Poured into my glass and for some reason, it appeared to be somewhat flat? Oh well.  Smelled awesome though! Huge pine and herbal and grapefruit bomb. You can tell the hops are here lurking underneath that head. Here comes the artillery!  But....not quite there. It was good, don't get me wrong, but the hops are all up front and then die out, with no malt underneath. Its a good nice big bold bitter beer though...  Overall, I think this beer is on the verge of being great. Its not quite there, but I think it has an awesome presence.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,klaybie,4.68,"Split a six-pack with a friend, awesome purchase.  A: Golden, yellow almost like fruit juice in color. Good frothy two finger head that lasts.  S: Lots of citrus here with resiny hop notes..wonderful!  T: AMAZING! Citrus, hop oil/resin, a multitude of fruit flavor (pineapple, grapefruit, orange) and delightful bitterness. The bitterness lingers and refreshes for the next drink.  M: Very good medium to lighter bodied, little carbonation.  O: Phenomonal, I didn't think I was this into hops until I tried this beer. Well worth the $16 for a sixpack, but after three my palate and sobriety were (delightfully) RUINED!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,WastingFreetime,3.75,"Hazy deep orange in color with a quickly receding single finger eggshell colored head.  Smells of white pepper sprinkled on lemon and grapefruit rind with loads of pine tree sap. Cowering in the shadowy background is a faint glimmer of toasted malt.  Tastes just as peppery as the nose, but leans more toward citrus peel elements than pine elements, and quickly changes into a straightforward power chord of boiling-step addition hop bittering (boiled pine) that absolutely blasts away the feeble malt presence. It does often feel unbalanced because there just isn't quite enough malt to make a solid canvas for the astringency of the muscle-car engine that is the hop bittering to truly shine upon. And that transition from one kind of hop profile into the other is clunky and sudden, like a switch suddenly being thrown.  Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side of medium, but damn is it ever creamy and smooth in texture, which makes up for the thinness. The ABV is well hidden, at no point at all does it behave boozey or ""hot"".  This brew is just like the muscle car metaphor I used earlier. Simple, straightforward, delivers one thing (powerful straightforward bitter) with exquisite speed, gusto, and showmanship. But just as a muscle car is not good for complicated cornering or subtlety, this beer is not the best for drinkers seeking an IPA with malt balance against the bitterness, or a subtle display of multiple aspects of flavor profiles that different kinds of hops can create working together in tandem harmoniously. Be sure that you are looking for the muscle car ride and not some other kind of racing car experience before you buy this brew, and you won't be disappointed.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Krakistophales,4.42,"A: Pours a light orange color with a fingers worth of white head that becomes a film  S: Piney hops, citrus hops, pineapple, honey, slightly malty backbone  T: Huge assault of piney and citrus hops up front, the middle producing some pineapple/pear/peach fruity aethers along with a slight malt base, and the finish returning to the cloying, resiny, piny taste and mouthfeel of glorious hops  O: This is called ruination for a reason. A fantastic DIPA. Yet again, stone never fails.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,chicagoabbot,4.5,"A classic big IPA...chug into a snifter...great appearance, bright with plenty of head...smelling then tasting tells you they put more hops into the boil than into the dry hop...strong, big, bad...recommended, even if I think there are better ones out there...doesn't really compete with the local 3Fs DIPAs, but it is quite a bit cheaper too",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,CapitalGains,3.8,"Poured and tasted 7/18/11 12 oz. bottle poured into a Deschutes Imperial Pint glass  Pours into a golden body with about an inch and a half of thick, creamy head that takes its time to settle. Does not leave as much lacing as one might expect considering the initial head. Aroma is primarily citrus hops, sweet sugar, lemon, oranges, and a bit of floral and piney scents. Taste is embodied by tangerines, pineapple, and grapefruit with a very present bitterness (as expected with 100+ IBU at 7.70% ABV). Hop bitterness is the defining factor in this brew. Finish is a bit dry and the malt presence seems subdued. Proper level of carbonation and the mouthfeel is spot on - not too thin or thick. A couple of these can definitely ruin your palate, as evidenced by the name. A little too forward on the bitterness for my preferences. Picked up at six-pack for $15; to be honest there are better deals for other IPAs out there in my opinion.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Kubus,4.26,"A: Pours a tangerine colour with a frothy white head. Very active while pouring, continues to bubble merrily afterwards.  S: Hops, apples, cactus, pine, some phenols.  T: A very smooth IPA. After having Arrogant Bastard and finding it a little too bitter for my taste, I was scared to open this bottle, but was pleasantly surprised. Strong, but not overpowering, hops throughout. Bitter aftertaste, but not mean.  M: Very bubbly and crisp. Fluffy clouds of head appear almost out of nowhere while drinking. Surprisingly balanced.  O: This beer may appear intimidating or even undesirable to some, but I would definitely say this is a good example of an IPA, rivaling my favourite (Southern Tier IPA or 2XIPA). Definitely warrants a try, would buy again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,bogus564,4.2,"Poured into a pint glass.  It's 5 o'clock somewhere; thank goodness that somewhere is my man cave.  A: The color is a light golden amber, on the cloudy side. The resultant head was just about 1cm, and did not last very long.  S: The hops come through a bit in the nose. I hope I'm not coming down with a cold, because I didn't detect anything really strong; just a citrus hop.  T: Nice citrus hop profile; I'm getting grapefruit up front, followed by pine. I like a good IPA, and this is a good one. It's strong, living up to the name Ruination. Three of these bad boys and most NASCAR beer drinkers I know would be ruined.  M: Very good, not outstanding; washes nicely over the palate, leaves a piny finish, carbonation seems just about right.  O: Stone makes a good IPA, and this is no exception. This would have gone perfectly with the steak I grilled for lunch. Then again, between that and the beer, I'd likely have been knocked unconscious.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mttaylor1066,4.25,"From a 22 oz. bomber.  A - Pours a nice rich golden ale color with a nicely formed head that lingers.  S - Well, if you can't smell the hops, don't you waste your time buying any more IPA.  T - Stone Brewing knows their craft and the proof is in the taste of this beer. An excellent, bitter, heavily hopped ale. The ABV is very sneaky here, the hops are balanced by a nice malty ""back.""  M - Good carbonation throughout all 22 oz. Start on this one early in the afternoon and enjoy it slowly.  Overall, an excellent IPA.  Serving type: bottle",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,beagle75,3.95,"Poured from a bomber into a tulip pint glass.  A: Clear, brassy golden color with over one finger of eggshell-tinted foam head that reminds of a sourdough starter. Light lacing remains on the glass.  S: Juicy hops redolent of ripe ruby grapefruit and other fresh herbaceous elements. The presence of bread, slightly toasty, is muted but present.  T: Begins barely off-dry, with fresh and fairly bright mixed citrus hop aromatics that turn piney by the middle. Acidity is moderate, further elevating brightness. Powerful astringency develops in the middle to usher in the respectably bitter finish. Dank herbaceous hops provide some exciting jungle qualities late. Malt is feather-light, struggling to provide balance to the hops as they turn aggressive.  M: Thin to medium viscosity, slightly acidic yet smooth on the palate despite the astringent flavor, with moderate carbonation.  D/O: Potent hops confirm that this beer is still worthy of the name. The fade to resinous but astringent pine in the middle is a little too clumsy and overdone to reward with accolades, but the crispness and the cleanliness underlying all of the powerful flavors is more than worthy. This beer is beguiling despite the punishment it inflicts on the palate. The opportunity to buy a remarkably fresh bottle of Ruination proves that sometimes you can go back again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BeerFiend2002,4.75,"Poured from bottle into chalice:  Pours a hazy burnt orange color with a fluffy one and a half finger off-white head.  Grapefruit, citrus, floral hop aroma, pine, and sweet malt.  Bitter, bitter, bitter from the front to the back. Strong hop punch up front with grapefruit, pine and sweet malt and a little citrus mid-palate to keep it drinkable. Hands off to yet more bitterness on the finish that lingers for what seems like an eternity. I love my bitters, so thats a good thing.  Medium-bodied brew with a juicy feel. Its got a light feel for a double, but its a nice switchup from the thicker doubles. Ah, and there is that dry finish that I love in these west coast IPAs.  This is a nice West Coast double. Its a stronger, very bitter and hoppy beer, but quite drinkable for a hophead like myself. Its not quite there with Bell's Hopslam and definitely not Pliny the Elder...but it is a very solid and worthy beer that I would definitely drink again given my love for my bitters.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,rundocrun,4.05,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. ""Enjoy by"" date of 6/23/11, so a little late, but oh well.  A - Pours a deep, slightly coppery gold color. One finger of white head that fades quite slowly. Minimal lacing on the glass.  S - Earthy, bitter pine up front. Hints of sweet orange and citrus. Some mild toasty or biscuit-like notes are also evident.  T - Sweet malt and lemony/fruity citrus intertwine up front, but they quickly yield to the crushing taste-bud-incinerating hop bitterness (We're talking 100+ IBU's here). Along with the bitterness comes more pine and bitter orange peel. Any caramel or toasted character from the grains are hard to pick out or are entirely drowned amid the hops. Finishes with a lingering bitterness and a mild metallic taste at the back of the tongue.  M - Medium body (slightly syrupy) with good, bright carbonation. Has an extremely dry finish that makes me want to keep gulping this one down (have to be careful with the 7.7% ABV, though).  Overall, this is quite an excellent DIPA. I was a little taken aback by the extreme hop presence of this beer, but I had to keep in mind that this is the first true west-coast DIPA I've had the opportunity of trying, so I had to be prepared for a little more hop-injected madness. If you haven't read the back of the bottle yet, do it. It's hilarious!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Knapp85,4.05,"This brew poured out as a murky golden orange color. The head was really big and foamy. The lacing was very sticky along the glass. The smell of the beer was very hoppy, they aren't fooling around with this beer. The aromas are mostly earthy to me, there are some qualities of citrus that peak through but not much. The taste of this beer is loaded with monster hop flavors. The mouthfeel is a bit oily and even a bit heavy. Overall as much as I like this IPA, I feel there are much better choices out there. For some reason the hops they use in this don't really do it for me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

A smooth finish that reminds me of honey and medicinal herbs.  M - Full and Powerful. Mild Carbonation.  Overall - This is one great DIPA. I think it is right there with Hopslam.

Tapped into a Pint Glass from the Black Tap Handle with the White Devil and ""Ruination"" on it and a keg date of 4-1-11.  Aroma- Hoppiest it can be. Earthy and a bit of citrus but no malt or sweetness found. Actually, nothing than hop is noted in the aroma...  Appearance- Received with a 1 finger head, dies down but keeps a bit of froth on the sides. HUGE lacing. Nice pale yellow body and effervescent.  Flavor- Hops, hops, and more hops! Sweet bitterness at the finish with bit of caramel and citrus. VERY NICE!  Mouthfeel- Medium bodied, watery a bit, light on alcohol taste, and leaves tang on the palate, and has a nice alcohol warming.  Overall Impression- Good all around.

Poured from a bomber into a perfect pint glass, best before 5-8-11 date (I know I'm a couple of months past date, but its all I could find and I'm in the mood for some Ruination tonight).  This pours a nice golden color lightly hazed with a white head. The smell is most obviously of hops, floral and some citrus, I was hit with it as soon as the bottle was opened. Mouth feel is good medium body the hops are very present. The taste is excellent, the high bitterness is the predominate taste hidden in there is also a nice citrus / grapefruit acidic taste, very nice (and loads of grapefruit bitter aftertaste). It seems that even being past date hasn't toned this down much, love it.

Seemed like a beefed up version of the regular IPA. Strong floral and citrus hops in the aroma. More of the same in the taste: floral and citrus, with a sweet caramel flavor coming thought, and lightly toasted malts in the background.

147,4083,plfahey,4.59,"22 oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass.  Appearance-Burnished gold with an orange-ish hue. Good Clarity. Moderately large off-white head with decent retention and some nice lacing.  Aroma-Awesome hop bouquet-candied grapefruit and mint show through the strongest for me, with lesser hints of citrus and thai basil. Malt is faint beneath the hops but has light notes of caramel and a hint of toast. Slight hint of pine as the grapefruit begins to fade, but still very herbal.  Flavor-Caramel malt flavors are cut short by the assault of hop flavor and bitterness. There's more pine in the flavor than in the aroma, but still plenty of herbal hop flavor, especially basil and mint. Hop bitterness is very high and aggressive. Aftertaste is dry and bitter, with lingering herbal flavors and a slight note of grapefruit. Finish is long and bitter, with herbal flavors staying on the palate for minutes after swallowing.  Mouthfeel-Medium full body with moderate carbonation. Talk about a tongue smack-down though, on my first sip, I felt like i'd had my taste buds punched off (in a good way). Leaves the tongue numb and tingly.  I had this beer a while back, but it was clearly not fresh. These bottles just got into MN and this beer fresh is pretty damn fantastic. Wonderful double IPA.

T: Great inital taste. You immediately taste a floral type taste followed by a great orangy/grapefruity taste. You are then dropkicked by an overwhelming amount of hop taste which i love. The initial finish is quite good, rounding up the floral, grapefruit and hop tastes, but then the bitterness kicks in the the final finish that linger on your tongue may be slightly too bitter.

Smell is piney, citrus like hop aroma. Very clean bitter bite grapefruit with even a hint of buttery richness.  First sip.. Wow, the smell of this beer is deceiving. You get a malty sweetness at first the swings over the top of your palate and then BAM!! The bitterness hits you, sour bitter grapefruit, pine, floral medicinal flavors linger as the brew goes down. This is a tongue hop shredder! Very pronounced bitters and Per stones site is well over 100IBU's. This beer is for you if your a hop head. Very good stuff.  Mouthful well is like most DIPA the bitterness lingers what seems like forever. This is defiantly a great sipping IPA. Probably paired well will some strong flavor cheese and meats. Creamy brew to say the least.  Overall great DIPA, I love hoppy beers and at one time that’s all i bought was hopped out outrages brews. I’ve gone away from that and its nice to know i can still get down with the hoped crazed beer geets.

Lots of juicy grapefruit/pine flavour with a bit of bready malt backbone. Long-lasting citrus rind aftertaste. Medium bodied, a touch slick/oily.

147,4083,Stretch270,4.74,"Served in a stone Cali belgic glass from a 1pt 6fl oz bottle.  Appearance - a nice cloudy golden yellow hue with a cloudy white head a couple fingers deep.  Smell - this beer claims to be an ode to the hop and it certainly doesn't fail to deliver. Hops dominate the fragrance, but the smell is not just hops but a crisp and fresh forest if hops. If you absolutely adore the smell of fresh hops, this beer is for you. Every time I smell this beer I harken back to the tour I took at Stone and the vision of heaven I saw when I entered that room.  Taste - once again I allude to Stone's claim that this beer is an ode to hops and the taste does little to disappoint. Hops is the first taste that comes to mind. There is just so much in the way of aromatic and bitter hops that makes this beer a delight to drink.  Mouthfeel - I think this beer feels heavier because of the prominence of the flavor permeates the entire surface of the tongue. That said, there is a pleasant aromatic hop ovetone to the head that contrasts with the hoppiness of the mouthfeel that allows for a nice texture to this beer.  Overall - hops hops and more hops. Imperial ipa is my favorite type of beer and I thi ruination is central to the genre for it's great combination if hops, both in aromatics and flavor.

147,4083,LXIXME,4.23,"Big off white head that slowly recedes leaving a decent lacing atop a honey golden colored beer.  A light alcohol hint is present in a citrus and pine hops aroma.  A very decent hops, citrus with slight piney taste with again a slight alcohol taste coming through.  The aftertaste is a slight bitterness on dry.  A pretty decent IPA and I'll gladly drink this anytime you wanna bring some over, but the weird thing is that right before I drank this beer I had a Two Hearted Ale from Bell's and I liked that IPA more than the Stone and I really have never heard much about them nor had I had the opportunity to try their stuff until now.  That's not a slam against Stone, just I had two really good IPA's back to back from two breweries that seems quite different, proof yet again that there is a God.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I could smell this from three feet away!  T: Bitter bitter bitter! Glorious citrus flavors that leave you wanting more and this beer provides! Nice malt backing to even the flavor out but hops dominate in this brew.  M: Smooth and a bit dry on the mouth feel but oh so wonderful.  O: This is by far one of my all time favorites. The taste is spectacular and overwhelming. Total sensory overload but in the greatest way possible!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,SkunkWorks,4.42,"Had on tap at the Ginger Man in New York City. Served in a tulip. Review from notes.  I've reviewed this on cask and in the bottle, this is my first time having it on tap.  Look: hazy orange with thin, cream colored head with great retention and lacing. Good.  Smell: much more resinous than I remember, but pungent citrus aroma as well. Smells good.  Taste: huge, piney hop taste with a bit of citrus, grapefruit and some floral, fruity hops as well. I can't detect any malt or alcohol, which is something I like about my DIPAs. Good.  Feel: medium bodied, crisp, hidden alcohol, and easy drinking especially for the alcohol content.  Overall: one of my favorite DIPAs and each time I have it, I'm reminded of why. Getting it from a freshly tapped keg was a real treat. Cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,RoadPhish,4.39,"A--Orange, honey color. Fairly thin, slight haze. One-finger head that slowly dissovles. Nice lacing on the glass--sticks like a champ.  S--Some citrus, lemony scents breathe through the glory of hops. Very inviting to the senses. The mind begins to turn at the smell of Ruination!  T--Citrus and bread-like flavors are evident, regardless of the hops. While alcohol and hops are (quite!) noticeable, neither overpower the refreshing flavors that Stone has packed into this DIPA.  M--I would not plan on tasting something new after you've finished one of Stone's best. You're mouth will go numb after this one.  O--One of the best DIPAs I've had in a long time. Ruination tests Racer X----and all of its hop bitterness and citrus aromas!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,orangesol,4.22,"Reviewed from notes. Bottle poured into a Duvel tulip glass.  A - Pours amber orange with a nice pillow of one finger tall white head leaving spotty lacing down the glass.  S - Smells of pine and citric hops, grapefruit, and a small amount of caramel malt. This one is all about the hops.  T - Lots of hop bitterness throughout. Hints of pine, citric fruit, caramel sweetness, and a touch of bread dough. Finish has plenty of bitterness, lingering for some time. One of my all time favorite IPA's.  M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Sticky feel with plenty of lingering bitterness in the finish.  O - I have been drinking this beer for a few years now and it has never let me down. Sure, there is the occasional out of date bottle but that isn't the beers fault. Still one of the best IPA's of all time.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,cosmo4u,3.9,"purchased 6/15/11 from cable beverage bardonia NY  The Pour:  Ruination is an orangish golden color. The brew looks a tad thinner than what I expect for a DIPA, but it leaves behind the tell tale sticky lacing from the remains of its two finger head. What is notable is that the brew sports a bit of a haze, which may be cool if it is indicative of wheat as an ingredient. I love the the addition of wheat in hoppy brews.  The Nose:  How many ways can I describe, “whoah, this is one hoppy beer!” Bitter. The aromas of grapefruit and lemon zest occasionally allowed a glimmer of caramel malts  The Taste:  Well, upon entering my mouth, I realize it is not as brutally bitter as I was anticipating, which is great. I actually tasted the caramel and toffee malts. I doubt wheat was used in this brew; the sweet, and delicately raw qualities of wheat seemed absent. The beer is actually balanced pretty well. The medium body could have used a viscosity boost, and I’d preferred a bit more sweetness, especially in the swallow, but it was pretty good. Fruity notes were limited to grapefruit, lemon/mine, and a slight cantaloupe flavor. A bonus was the absence of astringent vodka flavors I frequently come across in DIPAs.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,TheBeerAlmanac,4.29,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip  A: Gold with a dense, foamy head. It’s a lot more plentiful than one might expect.  S: The aroma is a concerto of oranges, grapefruit, grass, and deliciousness.  T/M: Tastes like it incorporates the citra hop, but their website claims the use of Columbus and Centennial. The hops are central in the flavor and actually subdue the obligatory citrus flavors. It’s a lot more hoppy than OAKED Arrogant Bastard Ale and has a citrus zest finish.  It’s a really great IPA with a sweet citrus twinge. Stone, you can ruin my palette any time.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,drtth,4,"Served in a stemmed flute style goblet . Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically.  Appearance: As served the beer is a clear golden tinged orange with a ¼” white head that persists for quite a while and creates good patterns of lacing. Sipping leaves lacing sticking to the sides of the glass for most of the beer but it isn’t as thick and patterned as some I’ve seen.  Smell: The aroma is filled with pine resin and grapefruit zest, but there seems to be little or no malt character to pick up.  Taste: The flavors are pretty much grapefruit zest and pine resin with little or no malt showing. But the malt does make its presence known in the control it exerts over the bitterness. This beer does not have the tongue rasping character of some West Coast beers.  Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is smooth and medium-bodied with good carbonation. The finish is long and dry and filled with resinous bitterness.  Drinkability and Overall Impression: While I enjoy sipping through this beer and expect to have another someday, its not something I’d put on my shopping list for regular consumption. My overall impression is that this is a very good example of the West Coast style (mostly all about the hops with the malt playing a very secondary role) its not a beer at the top of my list.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Rocketman8911,5,Probably one of the best Imperial IPA's I have ever had.  The appearance was great a nice 2 finger head and beautiful light amber color.  The smell is of hops is deep with a citrus note and slight malt note.  The taste is sweet malt on the tip of the tongue and hops the rest of the way.  Mouthfeel is medium body with a nice level of carbination.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Yagman3000,4.15,"Poured from a bomber into a brandy snifter.  Appears a golden color with hints of orange and a creamy head that slowly subsides. Lately I've been appreciating super hoppy beers that are on the lighter side of the color spectrum yet still packing a punch.  Smells strongly of hops - possibly Cascade - with a lot of tart citrus, specifically grapefruit.  Taste has plenty of hops but I'm getting a strong taste of the bittering hops than what the nose imparts. Less fruity in the mouth. Not much malt flavor picked up.  Mouthfeel is a bit creamy up front and then straight into ""Bittertown USA."" A thinning of the tongue and a mildly dusty finish.  Overall an enjoyable beer and I'd definitely have it again but would rather have a double IPA that balances out with a bit more fruit.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,spree92,4.17,"Golden-yellow straw with a plush egg shell head. Constant flow of micro-carb bubbles. Syicky pine, earthy grass and citrus, mostly grapefruit. Both aromatic and tasting hops must have been used. Full on hopped IPA. Not a trace of malts to be found. The sticky hops linger in the cheeks and on the tongue. Another flavorful IPA from Stone. They know their way around good beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Aircow86,4.24,"Served cooled and poured into an oversized wine glass.  Appearance: Pours a lighter color than most DIPA's (their regular IPA also seems lighter than most from my memory). I'll take this as a positive indication that malt flavor will play second fiddle to the hops. Head has remarkable staying power, lacing is equally impressive.  Smell: An intoxicating citrusy sweetness bursts forth when I open the bottle. Floral notes abound, west coast hoppiness all the way here. I could smell this all day long.  Taste: Pronounced hop bitterness, pretty damn close to pure hop nectar. A little malt on the aftertaste is a nice touch, working to curb the hop bite. As far as DIPA's go, Ruination puts those hops significantly more in your face than the malt - just how I like it.  Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation, no complaints there. Creamy mouthfeel is good but could be better.  Overall: Another great beer from Stone. I've had better DIPAs but Ruination definitely ranks up there with the best. Expensive at $18 per 6-pack but a nice treat.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Tons of wonderful hop aroma! Mainly citrus but also notes of freshly cut grass.  -I once heard someone describe Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale as ""way too bitter."" I think their tongue would implode as soon as it touched a drop of this.- Lots of very sharp citrus bite right out of the gate. a touch of orange then lemon. Grassy/pine flavors are present but the citrus is the star here. there is some caramel sweetness also but you've got to look a little for it. There is a hint of balance here but only a hint. Finishes dry with, what else, a lingering bitterness.  Medium bodied with a medium amount of carbonation.  Have wanted to try this for awhile now and I'm glad I finally got the chance. While not something I'd drink every night, I did enjoy it and would defiantly have again. If you haven't tried it before, do yourself a favor and find a few bottles.

The floral notes are echoed in the flavor, along with a whomping hop bitterness which somehow does not persist long as an aftertaste. This is a very clean and crisp IPA. There is a bit of a citric note to the hoppiness as well. My palate may be ruined already from excessive hop consumption, but I find this beer quite well balanced.  This is a standby for me when I'm shopping for IPAs. This pairs well with steak, burgers, salty foods, and strong cheeses.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I was elated to discover a bottle at Whole Foods that was best before 8/18/2011 - less than two weeks old! Served in a Bell's tulip.  A - Two fingers of white foam settle to a thick ring and near-complete cap, leaving some minimal lacing. The body is a transparent dark golden color.  S - A plethora of hop aromas - tropical fruits, pine, dankness, citrus and perhaps a faint note of alcohol. Some brown sugar malt character and a hint of cereal malt.  T - Lots of piney hops, initial grapefruit bitterness that surprisingly dissipates by the time the finish rolls around. Cereal grain malt backdrop. Not as palate-destroying as I remembered - I must have undergone palate shift since the early days.  M - Medium body, super dry, lower carbonation. Resinous with plenty of residual hop oils.  D - Forgot how easy to drink this beer is - the 7.7% is well-hidden outside of the nose. I split a bomber with Mike and it went down very quickly as a warm-up for some bigger brews.

This is a hoppy beer, but it is not at all overpowering. The citrus provides just enough balance, and makes this a brew that hides it ABV very well. o- this is a great DIPA from stone.

147,4083,Rschis16,4.55,"Presentation: cool, recognizable 22 oz. bottle poured into my brand new Stone tulip glass. Beautiful and healthy sea-foam head over a hazy yellow-orange colored beer. Lacing sticks to the top of the glass already as the head slowly dissapates. Smells of floral and piney hops, and some kind of fruit. Easy on the nose and nothing but pleasant. A twinge of alcohol as it warms up.  Right of the bat, the combination of piney, floral, and citrus hops reach out and grab your palate, and don't let go. The big hop bitterness lasts a good long while after the taste. Further tastes reveal a twinge of apricot or orange right at the very beginning of the sip. But the hops then take over and begin to beat on your tongue, but in a good way. The alcohol is almost non-existent through those strongly bitter hops until it warms up, and even then there is only a small taste of it. It finishes on the dry side with a crisp and clean mouthfeel that I feel makes this beer so great.  This is of course a Stone brew so of course, a plethora of hops was expected. But what strikes me about this one compared to some of their other hop monsters is the balance acheived. For instance, Arrogant Bastard is great, but its too heavy and bogged down by the mouthfeel and it maybe seems slightly overmalted, at least for my taste. Ruination is crisp and clean and refreshing, yet super hoppy and perfect for any hop head needing his hop fix. Fantastic beer, I will buy this again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

A bit of grapefruit and pine.  T- Sweet caramel flavors up front, almost immediately followed by a wave of hop intensity. Pleasant hop bitterness. Piney, grassy, lemony delight.  M- Very dry.

147,4083,Dope,4.45,"Got a very fresh bomber of this to try - right out of the case before it was even unpacked, approximately 3 weeks old.  A: A light amber color with a beautiful tall white head. Surprisingly light given that it's a double IPA. Head retention is top notch, takes minutes to settle down to a reasonable level and leaves a very nice lacing as well.  S: Yum! Delicious hop aroma. Somewhere in the background is the malt smell but the hops are hugely dominant here. Very citrusy and extremely strong. The kind of beer you can smell from across the room. I keep picking up my glass just to smell the beer.  T: For a split second it tastes sweet and then the hops drop the a-bomb on your tongue. Very strong and very bitter. Typical west coast hop profile, just amplified. No alcohol taste detected, probably hiding behind the hop overload.  M: Medium body with good carbonation. I would say a little lighter than most big double IPAs, it seems they focused more on making the hops big rather than making the entire beer ""big"" (like a Maharaja or a Double Crooked Tree for example).  D: Pretty low but it's to be expected with a hop bomb like this. I doubt anyone would willingly drink more than one bottle of this at a time. Your tastebuds would give up the ghost. Not really a true negative just a side-effect of the style. Not all beers are meant to be drunk in large quantities.  Overall, I gotta say that this is quite a nice double IPA. It's not quite as big as some of the beers I already mentioned but the hop flavor is there in spades. Very enjoyable beer in all aspects if you can handle the bitterness. Not a beginner's IPA by any stretch of the imagination.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Nice bitter drawn out finish, and enough of malty backbone to take away any possible dry edge.  In short - love it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,bump8628,4.1,"12ozer poured into a big tulip.  Golden with orange highlights and a solid cap of white foam that falls to a thin sheet of bubbles.  This one flat out smacks you in the mouth. Not necessarily with the overwhelming amounts of hop volatiles that newer DIPAs have, but with a huge wallop of bitterness and a smooth alcohol note. Hops are direct and coarse (in a good way) with bitterness that clings to the cheeks and purely bitter citrus rind and grass. No layering to be found here, just a direct hop assault. Malt gives just enough breadiness to feign support, while the yeast gives off a distinct pineapple note as it warms.  First Generation hop bomb here. Not explosively juicy and resinous, just a big, lovely, hit of hops.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mattjv,4.3,"Pours a orange/copper color with respectable head retention and moderate lacing.  Expected IPA characteristics on the aroma. Caramel malt, tangerine, lemon, and light solvent alcohol presence.  Lots going on with the taste. Bitterness comes in strong right from the start. caramel malt is a noticeable presence but quickly gets lost among the hop flavors. Big grapefruit and pine presence. Tangerine citrus like the aroma, grassy notes and tea flavor also come through. Light alcohol present on the taste especially as it warms, not surprising for nearly 8%. clean aftertaste, mildly soapy. Medium bodied with the right amount of carbonation.  Overall: A very solid IPA. I couldn't find a freshness date anywhere after scouring the bottle at length, but it certainly tasted fresh. Definitely not for one who is just exploring hoppy beers. It didn't quite live up to the novel of propaganda written on the bottle, but that's just how Stone does it I suppose. Would definitely pick this up frequently if not for the price, its great as an occasional treat though.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,UMNbeerhunter,4.24,Poured into a Brooklyn Brewing tulip on 6/17/11.  Pours a clear golden straw color with a fluffy white head that dissipates quickly leaving little to moderate lacing on the glass. I like the color of the head and the retention is alright but I would like to have seen a hazier color with more orange and amber tones. Its no the greatest looking IPA but not the worst either.  Smells smells of lots of citrus hops right away and that is ther dominant aroma but there is also a significant amount of floral hop aroma in the background mixed with a little bit of sweet malts. This is a treat to smell and really has a lot going for it. Truly a hop forward aroma.  Taste is a lot like the smell. Tons of citrus hop bitterness slams the pallet. Like the smell there is some floral presence and some sweet malt but it gets really pounded out by the citrus hop taste. Taste is really good but I find myself wanting more sweet taste after a few sips.  Mouthfeel is light in weight. The 7.7 ABV is entirely covered up by the hop presence. Pine resin covers the pallet and leaves a bitter pine taste in the mouth.  Overall this is a very good IPA and I am glad that Stone was finally able to make it to Minnesota so I can have regular access to it. It takes some hits on the appearance and and the taste could use some more balance but other then that its a great brew.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

This beer is an explosion of hops. You do not need to ""smell"" the beer smell them. At first crack, unless you are in an open field on a windy day, you are going to be bombarded with hops.  If you want to imagine tasting this beer, find a whole bud bud hop flower, drop it in a glass of water and drink it. This beer is pure hops. I'm sure there are malts and yeast in it as well, but the hops are overwhelmingly, and brilliantly present.  It's hard to describe the feel of this brew. It's very heavy and comfortably numbing. Your mouth will become entranced in the hops of this beer.  An amazing I.P.A. overall. This beer shows the true evolution of the I.P.A. a beer made out of necessity, at first to survive a long journey from England to India, and not a beer made out of necessity to combat Big Beer and all of it's evil doings.

147,4083,Rampage1,4.03,Appearance: This has a mostly clear golden color to it. When its first served there is some haze to it that dissipates. Nice pure white head to it.  Smell: Mostly citrus in the smell with a slight biscuit after tone to it. Not much malt in the smell at all.  Taste: This beer screams IBU's. It is pretty abrasively bitter at first but after drinking a bit it settles down. Very hoppy in the forefront of the taste followed by just a slight malt backbone. Definitely very hop forward.  Mouthfeel: Nice amount of carbonation that deliver that strong bitterness over the palate.  Overall: This is a great Double that I can drink a 22 of and be pretty satisfied.

Taste is pure hops and bitterness, a little off the charts hoppy but that's how I like 'em. Bitterness hangs on your tongue for a while. Simply awesome beer for hopheads everywhere..",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,deleted_user_574223,3.37,"I must first preface this review is coming from a non hop head. Keeping that in mind as well as havin g a healthy respect for beers of all types I will review this as best I can.  I poured the ruination from a 12 oz bottle into a goblet at about 45 degrees. It poured a nice golden amber with cream colored head.  The nose was all about the hops with a heavy lean towards the pine side of the spectrum with maybe a subtle note of citrud but I had a hard time detecting it.  The taste follows the nose with a heavy piney hops bitterness with a very subtle citrus note and a non existent floral note.  Overall, this beer was well outside of my hop liking parameter and too one sided for me to truly enjoy but I know that it is well loved and it is a well crafted beer packed ful of flavor. If hoppy bitterness overload is your thing that this IPA should be on your list. Enjoy!!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,SHODriver,4.38,"A: pours a light orange with an acceptable amount of head that recedes quickly S: Bittersweet on the nose with notes of citrus and pine with a touch of herbal qualities T: delicious hoppy bitterness fairly piney, slightly citrusy, barely herbal with not a lot showing from the sweetness with an herbal aftertaste that is very pleasant M: Very smooth with adequate carbonation O: one of my favorite double IPAs",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,twoheadedboy,3.95,"Poured from a 22 oz bomber into a snifter. A beautiful deep amber.  Smell is extremely hoppy, very floral and earthy but not excessively so. Taste is ridiculously hoppy as well, with sweet citrus, grass and fruit notes. Some rough bitterness showed up early on but disappeared as the beer warmed.  Overall a very good ipa; not sure it quite lived up to the hype, but still a very solid brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,psuKinger,4.88,"Bottle poured into a standard pint glass. This has always been one of my all-time favorite beers, so I'm excited to see how it holds up on a formal review.  A:Pours a hazy golden color with a thick frothy white head that sits on top and clings nicely to the glass. In the middle of the glass it's formed that big frothy ""pancake batter"" head that I like.  S: Big big bold scent of grapefruit and citrus. This IPA doesn't have a lot of nuances; it plays one chorus, and it plays it loud-and-proud.  T: This beer starts smooth before the the hops rush in. Lots of grapefruit and citrus hops that coexist in perfect harmony with a thin but present malt backbone. This beer sings my favorite melody: west coast hops. It's simple, direct, and gets straight to the point. And then it finishes with a delightful amount of pure hop bitterness.  M: Dry and sticky with good carbonation, this beer leaves plenty of sticky hops on the palate as it finishes.  D: Easily one of my top 3 favorite beers, drinkability and overall impressions are obviously quite high. I love this beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,secondtooth,4.36,"Beautiful hazy golden, with a large frothy head. Very lovely and thick 2-finger lace. A beauty!  Aroma is pineapple, sweet citrus, and some pine. No problem there.  Taste is bitter, but there's a smooth malt backbone to support the hops overload here. Delicious, and worthy of some repeat tastings in the future.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Nice head retention.  S - Hopy and citrusy. Oranges and grapefruit. Whiffs of pine are present.  T - Dry and bitter. Great bitter hop flavor that gets you in the back of the pallete and tongue. Grapefruit and orange aftertaste that stays with you for a while.  M - Has a medium mouthfeel, good carbonation.  O - A very good IPA. Great crisp hop flavor, slight warming as is goes down.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,mdr4669,4.35,"App: Very clear amber content body with over 2 fingers of bright, yet slightly off white head and consistent chunky lacing.  Smell: Overwhelmingly hoppy as well as some citrus and pine.  Taste: First are the hops, but I also notice some fruitiness, not the normal citrus effect presented in most IPA's but instead the sweet presence of peaches or perhaps apricots. There are also some malts and grains to balance out the after taste.  MF: A high viscosity IPA, very thick and creamy.  OA: When a brew reaches beyond what it's pre-consumption characteristics allude it is a beautiful thing. This is a well-balanced yet different IPA, thanks Stone, it's a jewel and was thoroughly enjoyed.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,JonathanG,4.39,"I had a pint of this at Hops & Pie, straight out of the freshly tapped firkin. I have not yet had this out of the bottle, but would love to try it that way as well, for comparison.  A: Nice and cloudy since it's unfiltered, but evenly cloudy. Sort of a golden-orange/amber color. Minimal head, but good lacing.  S: At first, I got a whiff of hemp oil, then the Simcoe hops really kicked in and fragrant pine notes dominated, along with light malt and citrus notes. Mostly it's all about the pine though.  T: Again, the pine dominates in the hops category, with a bit of citrus as well. Certainly on the drier side. Fantastic bitterness!  M: Medium-bodied and dry. Doesn't have the thickness or sweetness of some DIPAs. Nice and refreshing. Safe to say that this is a palate-wrecker, but in a good way, provided you like high-IBU beer. And if you don't like bitter beer, then what are you doing drinking this?!  O: I am happy I got a chance to grab a pint of this right out of the firkin! Would I drink this again? Without a doubt, yes! If you're looking for a bitter beer that is still refreshing and decidedly easy to drink, give Ruination a try, no matter how it's served.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,AndersonGT,4.67,"Wow, this lived up to all the hype!  A-Great amber color. Nice head.  S-Super piney, super hoppy  T-Oh so good. Excellent hoppy hit that lasts all the way through.  M-Easy drinking. I could knock out quite a few of these if they were not so expensive.  O-If I ever want to splurge this will be a good choice. Very pricey but well worth the money. Top 5 beer for me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Treebs,3.4,"Poured from 22 oz. bottle into founders snifter  A: Great light brown/orange hued pour with an off cream/orange colored head, about 1.5 fingers.  S: Cider like smell with sweet apples and green grapes coming through. Big hops at the end.  T: Not as impressed with the taste as with the smell. None of the sweetness notes from the smell come through in the taste. There is a slight bitter taste at the front end fades in the middle to almost nothing then kicks back in at the end and lingers.  M: Pretty crisp with good carbonation. Goes down smooth and has a lingering hop taste.  O: This beer did not match the hype for me. The flavor profiles of the hops and dried fruits fell flat and it most falls to a less enjoyable bitter state.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,fox227,4.5,"A: Pale golden with a bit of orange. The head is frothy white. Retention and head size seems to vary depending on what glass I used. For this review, I'm using a tulip, and the retention in much more impressive.  S: Hop overdose (the happiest way to die) of nice citrus, then piney notes.  T: The first few sips seem to be all hops - pine, grapefruit, lemon zest. But as it warms a bit, more sweetness from the malt is apparent, a bit of toasted biscuit, and offers more balance than the beer's press release would have you assume. I feel that this is a safe beer for hop-novices. But also it is an impressive beer for hop-heads!  M: Hops pervasively take control of my tongue, but the middle part is creamy, and the end is nice and sticky.  O: This is a rare DIPA that is not very high in the ABV category, which means it's fine to drink a few. I wish more doubles were like this - one of my favorite beers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,vespahulb,4.5,"What can I say about this beer that hasn't been said already? My local watering hole put this on monthly special for $4 a pint!! It was good to retry a beer that is pretty much a benchsetter DIPA  Massive hoppy aroma, almost like peeling a grapefruit under the nose! In the mouth, it's a level of pithy-bitterness that few beers can attain, yet still be throughly satisfying to drink. This is one of the few. Yeah, the hops are over-the-top and take center stage over the malts. Yet, somehow, it's forgiven with a zipping acidity that cleanses the palate and leaves you wanting more.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Kelly88,4.25,"Poured from a bottle into my Russian river Belgian glass.  A- a pale yellow with orange highlights. Very strong fluffy white head that is leaving intermittent gobby lace hugging the glass.  S- strong smells of hoppy pine cones balanced nicely sweet syrupy malts that blend into Nice citrus alcohol scents.  T- huge hop bite starts off the flavor, pine pine and a little bit of hoppy sweet grapefruit. Alcohol rounds off the taste. Real nice very bitter bomb.  M- medium lightish with a stellar combination of carbonation and hop bite for a IPA. Creamy and carbed, I like this.  Overall one of the most bitter beers I have ever had. The pine is the main flavor with great balance. I wouldn't pay the high price again for a sixer but definitely a great experience",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,lennerja,4.37,A- Pours a hazy golden yellow with a nice head that leaves some good lacing.  S- Aroma of crisp hops with citrus grapefruit notes.

147,4083,deadonhisfeet,4.22,"Picked up a bomber and let it sit angrily in the fridge for a few days.  Pours a cloudy light amber. Nice aroma of fresh lemon, grapefruit, orange, and pineapple. I am ready to ignore the warning on the label and ruin myself. Here goes...  Woah baby! The hops bite into your tongue like fire ants. You get a crazy firefight of citrus on the back of your tongue. It's pointless to try to pick out individual flavors. Bitter bitter everywhere, with just a touch of malt sweetness.  I love these punchy, hoppy beers. Very crisp and potent. For me, this one has just reached the peak of the ``over-done-ness'' hill and has just started coasting down the other side (as opposed to Founders Double Trouble, which is right on point for my palate). I couldn't drink more than one of these at a sitting and I certainly couldn't drink it every day, but I'll definitely try it again sometime soon.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,herman77,3.92,"A: Very clear golden honey color with a small bone white head. Decent retention and lacing.  S: Very pungent hop perfume with sweet grapefruit, a bit of tropical notes and a dose of toffee malt.  T: Bitter and astringent. The hops are damn strong and long lasting. There is some tropical fruits trying to break through, but mainly its just the grapefruit and citrus hops that provide the subtle sweetness. There is a bit of malt lurking in the background to give a nice addition. Its just so bitter and palate destroying.  M: Medium to full body. Good level of carbonation. Dry because its so bitter in the finish.  O: Palate recking for sure. Because of that, its a little hard to drink more than one in a sitting and you can't have anything else if you really want to taste it after you drink this one.

Big, smooth and creamy body. This is IPA - WANT HOPS!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,wcintula,4,"I've passed up numerous opportunities to try this beer, when finally I took the dive. Pours golden and a bit hazy with a small head, but seemingly proportionate for a 10 oz(?) pour. The smell is just a barrage of hop variety, floral, citrus pine. The taste hits you as such but a proper sweet malt spine to keep it all together. The pine flavor is the one that seems to stick and coat the palate. A very bitter beer, palate crushing as everyone has said. I would give higher on the mouthfeel, but I just feel it was a little too syrupy.  I drank this along with a salad of arugula, and other peppery leaves, which complimented the beer well. I guess I didn't drink the salad, though.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,DovaliHops,4.12,"Finally was able to find a fresh bottle. It really pisses me off that even in California, it is very hard to find fresh Stone beers. This one doesn't expire until mid-June. Pours a bright, clear golden-orange color with a small white head that disappears quickly. Scent is VERY hop forward. Lots of citrus aromas and hop aromas, mixed with very little malt and a ton of pine. Taste is initially citrus fruit, followed very closely by strong hop oil and intense bitterness. There is hardly any malt, which is what makes for a great west-coast IPA. There are some bread flavors as well. Tons of pine sap and just bitterness throughout each sip. Very intense IBUs here. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and a little sticky. Crisp finish. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is a great DIPA when it can be found fresh...which can be very difficult.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Finishes dry and a little sticky.  D: No trace of the ABV. Flavors are good. Aromas are fantastic. However, the bitterness was a bit overwhelming for me. Not a huge fan of the palate wrecking aspect.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Some sweetness is there as well. The scent is much like their standard IPA just more intense. This one lets you know its gonna get you.  The taste is much the same, just in GREAT excess. This one hits you... hard. Big bitter hop flavor, right up front. Pine is right behind, if not right along side the bitter taste. Then a tart citric flavor of lemon and orange comes in. After I swallowed, that bitterness comes back and bites yet again.  Feels medium bodied. This one had a real astringent quality to it. There's this stinging feeling, kind of like the way sucking on a lemon feels, bitter, tart and harsh. Difficult to get down at times. The drying quality of the alcohol comes in at the very end.  I enjoy hoppy IPAs but this one is just too much. The flavors are there but are there in EXCESS. Hops. Pine. Citrus. All there. All in a big big way.

Nose has loads of citrus, mango, orange, some dank and loads of tropical notes all around. Taste is bitter right off the bat, less maltiness and all citrus/tropical fruits. Some pine makes its way in there too. Heavy bitterness with a mouthfeel that lingers immesely. No alcohol.

After sifting through this a bit there's a nice malt.  Huge bitter earthy american hops up front. Citrus gathers through the middle and after several sips a malt began appearing. Some tropical sweetness in the middle. Profound hop bitter finish. The after is bitter and a nice orange taste. Subtle spicy alcohol notes compliment the hops for the finish.  Medium to light mouthfeel  Overall, hoppy. I think that there were hops. And also the hops were good. But yeah this thing balanced increasingly as I sipped and subdued malt sweetness developed well.

147,4083,TheDudeRules,2.67,Reviewed from notes taken on 4-8-11.  Light gold color is held within my Darkness snifter. Six feet of head that lasts forever. Very light pine and citrus on the nose. This smells pretty good.  I wish it tasted as good as it smells. I think there could be a tad more carbonation. Bitter pine is up front. Hop bite is non existent.Slightly dry on the backend. I will say as the beer warmed the taste did improve.  Way to go Stone for making a terrible example of a dipa. People are excited about the brewery being released here. I am not in that camp. This beer is less than stellar. So why should my beer dollars be given to a less than average product when there is local superiority already established? Good luck Stone you are going to need it. Surly is king in this state and you will soon find out.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,MaxSpang,3.36,"Poured from 22 oz. bomber into a snifter  First off - WOW! This is extremely intense beer!  Appearance - One of the best-looking IIPA's - and beers in general - I've ever seen. A beautiful crystal clear orange color. The head was a good 2 fingers and was off-white, almost a slight orange color. It looked like apple juice with a foamy head. Looking at this beer in a snifter would make your mouth water!  Smell - Definite hop presence (duh). American hops - citrusy, orange-grapefruit almost. A slight fruity characteristic and a little bit of malty sweetness.  Taste - KA-POW! I wonder why they call it Ruination... Right away, ridiculous bitterness from the hops. I am 3/4 of the way through the bottle now, and so far they are still hanging around. My tongue is sort of adjusting, but I still taste a huge amount of the bitterness. Usually with IPAs and IIPAs, the bitterness sort of disappears after about halfway through the bottle. Not this one! There's a lot of orange flavor, as well as some slight piney-ness. Very slight grapefruit flavor, especially compared to other IIPAs (Double Trouble, Pliny, etc). There's a slight lemony characteristic - more so in the ""sting"" than flavor. After awhile, there's a fruity/malty sweetness but I have to say it's kind of difficult to find it on the tongue due to the hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel - A moderate body on this one, not as thick as other IIPAs I have had. There's a little bit of carbonation toward the beginning, but not nearly enough to scrub the tongue. There's also a slight sting from the bitterness - the kind of thing that would make you really notice a mouth sore if you had one. All of that being said, though, it is quite drinkable. It's very smooth once you get past the hop mine field.  Overall - This is not your average, every day IPA! I have a friend who dislikes hops and he said this beer was the worst thing he has ever had. I disagree with him, but I will definitely agree that if you don't like hops then you should STEER CLEAR from this beer (it says so right on the bottle!). If you are a hop head (like me), then you will find this beer quite enjoyable and very, very interesting! I feel like if you drank this too often, you would no longer be able to taste hop bitterness.  It's definitely a tasty beer, I found it quite enjoyable and I would definitely drink it again! (But not too often)",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,JackieTH,4.25,"Full bomber poured into a 24-oz glass, golden, slightly bubbly, with two fingers of head, leaving lacing. Smell was an inviting blast of pine and citrus-grapefruit. The taste was one-dimensionally resin bitter with little if any balance. Of course thats by design, but it's somewhat over the top for me.  I'd be willing to revisit it occasionally, but it always ruins my palate..  Revisited 7/2012:  Creamy smooth mouthfeel, zingy carbonation very nice. Synergies apparent with the citric, tropical hop favors doused in a provident malt base. Does tend to get dry, and dries out the palate, but nonetheless it's very drinkable, very enjoyable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Given the name, I was ready for a rather intense IPA. Kind of disappointing in that regard. Has a harsh finish. Decent flavor, I suppose, but not too much complexity. Slightly watery mouthfeel. Challenging to swallow.  One of these will do. Don't think I'll go out of my way to have another.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ZenAgnostic,2.64,"Tapped into a tulip.  Appearance - Pale hazy amber body. Small head with decent to low retention.  Smell - Very complex and grassy. Slight manure smell. Very distinct wet paint smell with a hint of mold. Good smell other than the wet paint off-smell that can't be unsmelled.  Taste - Astringent taste combined with the smell makes me think of paint remover.  Mouthfeel - Good smooth mouthfeel.  Overall Drinkability - The wet paint smell was a beer ruiner. Talk about ruination. Had high hopes for this beer coming in, so I'm surprised that this was such a let down. Maybe I got unclean glassware, or there were bad tap lines, but for whatever reason this is the first high expectation beer that has bombed so horribly for me in a long time.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S: Pungent angry hops, lots of alcohol, maybe even some rubbing alcohol, hop oil. As it warms the hop profile blossoms into spiciness, mild citrus, more pine and some biscuit.  T: Bitterness hits me upfront, then the white grapefruit, some citrus, mild pineapple. I do get a sense of tropical fruit notes people mention but not sure I could have identified it on my own. The biscuits come in and quickly depart allowing the acidic alcohol notes to pull you into another round of herbal and grassy notes before a big bitter finish that. Insane blend of hops and malt.  M: Thick and full.  O: Strange hop bomb. It comes on super bitter and alcoholic but turns out to be very interesting mix of citrus, earthiness and pale malt.

147,4083,danielsonc,3.52,I thought this beer stood up to the typical stone philosophy - bold hoppiness. I do enjoy a great IPA and this is definitely one of those. Though this beer does not tickle my IPA tongue fancy. The bitterness of the beer is not balanced with anything. I feel like stone just put a bunch of hops in without anything else. If there is anything else added to the beer it cannot be tasted due to the overpowering plethora of hops. I think a delicious IPA needs to have that bold hopiness added with a nice balance. The nose on the beer is amazing and choc full of hops. The taste and mouthfeel left me wanting something to counter the bitterness a bit. Overall a great beer for straight up hops but my taste buds wanted something that mellowed that boldness,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BertoEwry,4.74,"My second favorite IPA...Pliny the Elder is first. Amazing flavor and bitterness. A refreshing amount of hops. Very clean tasting. Overall, one of my favorite beers. Too bad a 6 pack at bev mo is around $15 :( If you want an IPA that really stands out, this is more than what you are looking for.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Glibber,3.92,"Had this on tap in a tulip glass. Good looking beer, copper color with a whitish 1"" head that fizzle down after a few minutes. Really good aroma- pine, citrus, hops. Really easy going down and you could taste the orange peel citrus on the front, and not even that overwhelming on the back end- although the hops do linger a bit. At over 100BU, Ruination is supposed to ruin your palette. I enjoyed my beer without food, bubecause it might not pair well with certain foods.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,JednoPivoProsim,4.8,"Poured from a 12 fl oz bottle into a pint glass. Enjoy by 05 30 11 (when was this bottled??) Loooong description of the beer on the back of the bottle threatening to ruin my palate. Challenge accepted!  Appearance: Pours a cloudy, calm golden body with a thiiiick bready head on top. Beautiful looking beer. Head recedes from the bottom up, leaving about a quarter inch of dense dough.  Smell: Straight pine forest. Am I Christmas tree shopping? I'll take a douglas fir!  Taste: Fantastic! Pine and citrus fruit with virtually no detectable alcohol from this 7.7% ABV beast. A hophead's wet dream.  Mouthfeel: This beer feels thick and hearty. Could I live off of this and this alone? Quite possibly.  Overall: I don't know about my palate, but a beer this good could definitely be ruinous on my retirement savings. I'm in love...sorry honey.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,MonkeymooTJ,3.95,"Appearance:  Good mix of copper, orange and amber. Thick foamy head that is well retained.  Smell:  Citrusy hops with an essence of pine. A bit of a floral arrangement can be detected as well as sweet/caramel malt.  Taste:  Pine and citrus are the major players. The bitter kick proves the 100+ IBU label is no lie. The slight mix of the malty flavor is a very nice touch  Mouthfeel:  Low carbonation on the tongue. Goes down smooth. A little bit dry and surprisingly light for a DIPA  Overall:  I did enjoy this beer. The only issue I had was that it seemed to be a little pointlessly over bitter. However, that was what they were trying to achieve and they did so. And since I do enjoy bitter brews, it wasnt too much of an issue to me. I will definitely have another in the future",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ineva,4.92,"Poured into a Tulip/Flute glass.  A:This gives me the evil eye, a orange peel stare. One finger head leaves a savoring lace on the glass.  S:Sweet n piney greens, with a lot of citrus drizzle.  T:So bitter, the breath you take after every sip turns the air sweet. A bundle of grapefruit, oranges, lime, green apple pine cones.  M:The malts are skillfully set in this DIPA definitely a palate wrecker. But surprisingly tasted a little bit of toasted malts that sneaked in when it was at its coldest.  O:So much hops it got drafted straight out of High School.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,DoktorZee,4.47,"I'm catching this one right at the limit - best before is 4/11/11, and I'm right there. Poured from a 22oz bottle into multiple schooners...:)  A - light amber/yellow in appearance, clear with a fluffy white head that resolves after about 5 minutes leaving bits of lacing around the glass.  S - super fragrant citrus/pine hops on the nose. Nicely cutting and sharp.  T - the hops really dominate this one with a strong citrus hops bitterness almost like orange peel dominating over a hint of malt.  M - moderately carbonated but surprisingly light for an imperial. There's elements of oilness, as well as a hint of booziness but bother are relatively subdued.  D - it's surprisingly drinkable and goes down very easy!  A superb IIPA; delicious hop bomb, but not quite overpowering. Shows a lot of finesse.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,prg1976,3.5,"Enjoy by: 5/30/11  Pours a clear pale amber color. Thin white head, some retention.  Smell is citrus hops with a little alcohol and a little malty sweetness.  Tastes pretty much like it smells. Hops are there, but fading. Still fairly bitter, but a good bit of sweetness in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is good, not too carbed.  Overall, probably a little closer to faded than fresh. Still a pretty good beer, but it doesn't blow me away.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BeerDawgs,4.02,"A - A burnt orange, cloudy hazy color. Just the way I like em to look  S - Oh sweet heavens, the beer gods have shine a light on this beer. It smells fantastic. Sweet floral hops, with citrus present. Maybe some lemon.  T - Very good, but its a little more bitter and less citrusy than the aroma led me to expect. Very malty, bitter aftertaste. It is a malt/hop bomb for sure.  M - Medium bodied and pretty high carbonation level.  D - While it is extremely tasty, I think 1 is enough at a time. I will get it again though, for when I need a Hop attack!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mcslain,4.5,"Pours golden to orange. Fills the glass with a cloudy glow capped with glowing white lace. Head fades with snowflake lacing, nice overall retention. Nose is floral, citrus and pine. Taste is the same but earthy hops with grapefruit and some honey on the finish. Definitely a beer for hop fans only. Nice and creamy but still with a crisp mouthfeel. Extremely drinkable for a near 8% abv double. Another great beer from Stone, one of my favorite breweries. I could session with this double IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,tubacharlie,4.2,"The white head is of small stature, of a smooth consistency, with larger bubbles sporadically interspersed, with good stickiness and staying power. The aroma of fresh hops is unmistakable as it emanates from the glass, with a hint of lemony citrus. Active carbonation keeps the thin carpet of foam replenished as the slightly hazy amber liquid is consumed.  Brisk and bright hops surround the tongue as the brew hits the mouth, engulfing the taste buds with grapefruit and bitter orange flavors. A background of bread grains is barely noticeable as the hopfest dominates the palate, leaving a tangy citrus finish.  This is a well made IPA of good character.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,hiku7,4.07,"12oz bottle poured in a Nonic.  A - Golden amber with a fluffy white head. Somewhat cloudy body. Thick sticky lacing was impressive.  S - Very floral plus fruity orange peel citrus smell with pine background. No real malt coming through in the smell.  T - Hop bomb with some toasted malt coming through, but definitely playing second fiddle. The finish is deeply hoppy, and maybe that doesn't really catch it, but that's how it felt. Hops permeating my soul. The bottle says ""A liquid poem to the glory of the hop"" and that about sums it up. All that said, the deepness of the hop flavor loses some of the complexity found in other top IPAs. The alcohol comes through a bit in a pleasant way in the aftertaste.  M - Medium bodied and smooth, and doesn't detract from the smell and taste.  D - The hops are addicting and make me want to have another, but couldn't drink too many of these.  Overall, a bold tasty brew hopheads will love, though I still prefer Racer 5, Blind Pig and some others that to me seem to have a more complex and satisfying hop profile.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jifigz,4,"Bottle poured into a pint glass.  A: A pretty typical color for an IPA appearing a deep burnt orange.  S: Very floral and citrusy in the nose.  T: The taste, like the smell, is very floral and citrusy. It almost tastes like that flowery perfume smells that the old women would wear when I was a kid.  M: Pretty typical.  O: Don't get me wrong, this is a delicious IPA, but I feel that there is just nothing really separating it from the rest of the pack. It seems pretty generic in the land of IPA's, but as usual, Stone turned out a beer I would glady drink again and buy a whole case of, but there is just not a distinct hop flavor or aroma or an unusual malt backbone that really grabs my attention.  I just didn't taste anything that deserved all the arrogance that was painted all over this label, even if the words were true. After all, hops are so delicious and have slightly ruined my appreciation for all other tastes, but it wasn't this beer that did it for me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,b3shine,4.48,"Draft to brand specialty glass. On draft is a whole new ball game!!! The only complaint I have about this beer (on draft) is that it's defined (and priced) as a double...and it's 7.7%. Could be the best IPA ever, but it's a damn good double that has the alcohol content of a high-end single. But damn tasty!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,gkunkle,4.08,"Pours a golden orange color, a little hazy with a 1"" white head with decent retention. Smell is mostly hoppy, the citrus hops are coming through really strong. I think I smell a bit of malt, but my sniffer don't work to well. Upon first sip; the hops come in hard and fast, I am getting citrus and pine. Definitely a good west coast hip bomb, I'm loving this. I don't think I caught much malt in there, but I could care less considering the full scale hop assault in my mouth. Mouthfeel is decent, usually if I don't really notice the mouthfeel, it means it's just right. Overall, if you love IPAs and feel like getting punched in the mouth with a fistful of hops, this is a beer for you.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,MaltsOfGlory,4,"Pours a beautiful golden color, looks like an IPA should look, very summer like. It's pretty cloudy, there is almost no visibility through the beer at all. The head looks really nice, it's very creamy looking, lots of small bubbles. I want to give this a 4.5 on appearance, but the head already faded a little bit, it's sticking around at about a half finger length. It for sure smells like a double IPA, the hops just punish you up front on the nose, and then there is a nice citrus smell, maybe some tangy fruit in here as well, but I'm not the best at detecting fruit in IPA'S so I'm not sure. Overall the smell is really really good, it doesn't seem like it's skimping out at all on the taste, which I'm sadly finding more and more common these days in IPA'S. Well the first thing I notice on the taste is that there is no hop crispness, this beer is not crisp at all, which is very disappointing. I mean you can tell the hops are there because of the bitterness, but there is no crispness, which is very strange for a big hoppy beer. Also, the order of things are mixed up, the malt comes first, and then the hop bitterness, I'm a little confused here. It's by no means a bad beer, they did a good job, it's a quality beer, just a little strange. It really is a good beer, so I have a hard time grading this below a 4 on taste, part of me wants to, but I know that it deserves a 4. As far as mouthfeel goes, it's pretty standard for an IPA, nothing disappointing there. As for drinkability, on some tastes you can notice the alcohol more than others, but for the most part it is pretty subdued and is somewhat easy to put back considering it's an IPA. Overall a good beer, it's not the best IPA I've had, it's a little weak in some areas, but it's a solid brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jables7,4.55,"A- a golden orange, really nice looking beer.  S- this beer promises an assault on the senses and it delivers. This is not for the casual beer fan. My nasal passages cleared and for a second I thought I could see into the future. This beer smells exactly like an ipa should.  T- I feel like I've been hit in the face with a burlap sack full of hops and I love it. I'll warn you again, it you don't love ipa's then stay away from this beer. If you drink an entire 6 pack of this beer your first born will most likely enter this world with hop breath.  M- This beer engulfs your mouth in hop flavor. I could find nothing wrong with the mouthfeel despite the fact that I think this stuff could probably be used as paint thinner.  O- overall this beer is very close to ideal for the style. It is overhopped to the extreme and should only be handled by professionals. The ABV tends to signify an ipa while the hop profile leans heavily towards a double. This conflict brings down the score slightly based on style. Outside of that, this is another great beer from the hop geniuses at Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,DannyDan,4.38,"Pours out a cloudy orange with a tall white head that has nice lacing and very very good retention. It also has moderate carbonation. It has a nice aroma of citrus, earthy hops, biscuits, and pine. The taste is a pleasant taste of earthy hops, pine, followed by some floral hops and finishes off with some citrus and honey. The aftertaste has some orange and grapefruit in it. I do like the creamy smooth mouthfeel that is like heaven on the tongue and cheeks. This beer reminds me a lot of Bell's HopSlam Ale and I think both are worth trying for all you hop lovers out there.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,TheWhiskerReview,4.25,"Pours a cloudy golden-orange with a big, fluffy off-white head with supreme retention and lace.  Nose is a nice mix of apricot pit and biscuit malt with tons of leafy hop tones and other hints of vanilla and orange blossom honey.  The mouth has a small core of creamy caramel malt surrounded by a gigantic oily, bitter hoppiness. Chiming in further are wonderful complexities- moderate resin, citrussy flavors, a peppery alcohol and intense earthiness- leaving more flavors of grapefruit and cloves lingering on the long finish.  Wonderful execution. Seems to have more bitterness than the regular Stone IPA but still an incredibly smooth brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,socon67,4.17,"A - Pours golden and setlles to a more orange-ish hue. A lively white foam completes the pour.  S - Scents of fruit (pineapple, apricot) are present. Not nearly as piney or hoppy as other DIPA's.  T - Much more mellow than other imperial IPA's. This is more sweet with fruit than hoppy. It certainly stands out.  M - About as good as it gets with a smooth finish, a well masked ABV, and a well balanced sweetness to bitter. Easily could drink many of these.  O - I'd seek this out again. Maybe not a top tier DIPA but Stone has made another quality ale.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,match1112,4.62,"while not my favorite style of beer, i think i found the one that will turn me into an ipa drinker. poured a nice golden color with a 2 finger head. the smell was a bouquet of hoppy floral, citrus, perfumy deliciousness. went down smooth with a dry finish, yet not as bitter as i expected with 100 IBU's. definatly recommend to friends and will most certainly buy again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S- Smells kind of like the regular IPA, lots of citus fresh ops and some pine. Love Stone IPAs and i am excited about this one.  T- Wow okay very nice. Takes a while to dissect these flavors.. The hops come in strong and up front. The flavors just lay back and chill on your tongue as your whole mouth drys out. The orange citrus flavors are in the background along with some pine. Main this in this beer is opviously hops, and more hops. Not to shabby. Its a good flavor but i was expecting it a little better, but i wont complain because at 100 IBUS this is still a great drinking IPA.  M- Dry, very powerful hop flavor, pine lingers a little.. Not the best mouth feel.  I was very excited about this beer, and i still like it. I dont know if i over hyped this one but it wasnt as good as i was expecting.  However, its still a great brew by Stone and bold of them to put a 100 IBU beer on the market.. Good job Stone",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Nugganooch,4.15,"Bomber poured into my Stone pint glass *Enjoy by Date: 06/12/11  -Finally putting some pen to paper on this brew after years of enjoying this fine elixir. I saw $6 bombers at Vons and just couldn't resist for that price point these days. Besides, despite all of the numerous reviews before mine I am voicing my opinion because last time I checked this was America! And we are all winners in the craft brew game. So here we go...  A: Pours a very clear golden-straw pale coloured hue with a lumpy off-white foam cap that struggles to hold together. Lacing spiderwebbed down my glass nicely.  S: Smell is of big bright fresh candy fruit hop aromas. Akin to the aftersmell of biting into a fresh picked apricot or nectarine. Only after the beer melows does it start to sweeten with some caramel malt notes.  T: Puckering across the palate with great fruity hops and resinous pine flavors. Rounds out nicely with some soft n sweet caramel malt notes. Slightly warming going down, the alcohol definitely makes an appearance here. Picking up some very clean but distinct yeast flavors. Finishes quite nicely and somewhat dry from all the bitters here.  M: Is punchy a mouthfeel quality? Overall slightly sticky which coats the tongue nicely. Actually very light for such a big hoppy brew.  D: I would say if you are a hophead drinkability is superb by DIPA standards. ABV's are present but not overbearing. IBU's are in full effect so take heed as the label cautions if that is just not your thing.  A liquid poem to the glory of the hop! Probably my favorite brew in all of Stone's lineup...now if only it weren't so damn expensive!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,happy4hoppybeer,3.93,"Drink by date 4/11/11  Light,clear orange with nice thick,creamy white head,leaving equally thick creamy,white lacing. Very good.  Nice hoppy scents, with good noticeable caramel malt in background. Actually, the sweetness and malt beat the hops on the nose. Good,but underwhelming. I've smelled more intense IPA,let alone Double IPA aromas.  Hops do the bite the tongue quite sharply,but not as intensely as I was hoping,and as a previous reviewer stated, the flavors are not there to match. Nice lingering after effect on the palate. Body is shockingly thin/light for a supposed double/imperial IPA, ditto with the ABV.  Very good, but for a double/imperial ipa, it could most definitely be a lot better. More intensity in hops, a better body,maybe some more balance with malt could bring improvements. As a regular IPA, it rocks with the best of them.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,caskstrength,3.5,"Re-review now that Stone is in MN and I have a 3 week old bomber for 6.50 in my hands.  Pours a golden yellow, no haze. No sediment in bottle. Small white head. Pretty clear.  Smell is underwhelming. A little pine. A little citrus. Earth/grass, more than I hoped for. I've smelled better IPAs. Not drawing me in.  Smooth, bitter, medium to light body and very, very hoppy. This is not a balanced beer. It's all about the hops and the bitterness. Actually, one of the hoppiest beers I've had, but the flavors weren't there to match. Needed more richness and depth to be top shelf. Earth and grass fight with the citrus and pine. Finishes dry.  I appreciate it for what it is. Hops and little else. Hop bombs, however, don't have to be a bitter one trick pony. This is a one trick pony.  I like their IPA better, and the double dry hopped IPA I had on tap during ""Stone Week in MN"" was absolutey top drawer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Mouthfeel: Medium body with medium carbonation. Feels pretty light for a double IPA.

147,4083,specksnreds,4.79,"This beer has not been reviewed enough, because 2,400+ reviews is barely a sample set. My review will validate this beers existence on the computer.  My barely adequate olfactory organs sense, nay feel, pine cones. Like huffing green pine cones. Not brown pine cones, green pine cones. I might have tasted a peach or a nectarine or an apricot or a plum or a pear and a green pine cone. Bubbles? Check. Bitter? Roger that. Fantastic? Of course.  When I swallow it, it goes right down. Right down into my tummy. It tries to hang onto my tongue, but it still goes down. But it's also like it leaves behind its essence, a bit of its being on my t-buds. Like it's in two places at once: my tummy and bitterly on my tongue. I'm pretty sure it's a super position.

Skunky, floral hops on the edges of the glass with notes of malt coming from the middle. Bitter hops dominate the palate with floral pine and grapefruit notes not far behind. Dense but not heavy in mouthfeel with the bitter hops leaving the edges of the tongue tingling.

Well, it pours a hazy, golden color, with a smallish head. The smell is your typical pine, with light citrus that you expect in a DIPA. The taste for me is more resinous pine than citrus. Jacked up bitterness, which I love in an IPA, double or otherwise. It doesn't have that malty balance that other DIPAs usually have, which, in this case, is fine with me. The mouthfeel is less creamy than I expected. Very good overall. I dig most Stone beers and this one is no exception.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Brabander,3.71,Today Sietse (apophis666) paid me a visit. He loves the IPA beers so i cracked a few open. I got this bottle in a trade with listenatjoes.  This beer is not my style to be honest and this beer was an exeption (happy!!).  This beer has a light citrus taste ans there is some creamyness. There is no real bitter aftertaste and that makes this beer a good one for a non IPA lover.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,claspada,3.02,Aromas of a boat ton of citrus and grapefruit hoppiness. Underlying light pale malt sweetness beneath the hops. The taste is big big citrusy hops upfront along with lots of bitterness; extremely dry finish. Citrus returns in the aftertaste along with some lesser grapefruit and some sticky pine as well. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation. This brew really dries out the mouth; I need a pretzel to clean my palate after this hop monster. Overall this beer is just too resiny and bitter with zero malt backbone that I just can't get into. It literally ruins your palate as it promises and I appreciate the purpose but this is over the top. Some may like this but I am not one of them.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I am one of those people that is really sensitive to bitter tastes so it is not a surprise that I wouldn't be a big fan of this style.  A-Clear with orange amber appearance, weak head  S-Oh shit, this one is going to stick with me. Welcome to hopland!  T-Yep hop bomb, 10 minutes later it's still there, bitter, grapefruit, astringent mouthdrying NW US hops. There might be some alcohol in there too-but it doesn't matter I'd have to choke down another drink.  M-Pine sap? Gross  D-I'd rather drink yak piss.

Smell- Huge hops, very hop forward and strong citrus more orange vs. grapefruit.  Taste- This is just a palate wrecker. My tounge was done after this and this is why I saved it till last. Big hops and a matching bitterness make this a classic and even has a nice tangerine finish.  Mouth- Medium bodied with a medium carbonation and a dry hop finish. Just one of the most well finishes for a hop head.  Drink- I'll have this again. Just too good not to.

147,4083,Mosley1212,4.33,"Best by date of 5-3-11 on the bomber which I poured into my duvel tulip.  A--Bright orange with a little bit of cloudiness. I aggressively poured it and the bright white head was beautifully thick. With each sip, the beer retained on the walls of the glass. It was a very sticky retention.  S--Hops, hops, and then more hops! On another level there is sweet fruit, grapefruit and lemon. Then there comes a wave of pine which is either like an evergreen forest or freshly cut grass. Get a little bit of malt in it too.  T--Piney hops. The bitterness punches you in the face over and over again. Get a bit of grapefruit with each sip. I was drinking this while eating a lime cupcake and that really helped bring out the fruit in the beer. Love the taste.  M--Bit of carbonation in the tongue. Other than that, the tongue and the whole mouth just tastes bitter with the sips. Seriously,this is one of the bitterest drinks I have ever tasted.  O--I love hops, and I love bitter IPAs. This makes this beer perfect for me. If you are a hophead like myself, give this a try if you haven't. One of the best DIPA on the market",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,salvo,4.4,"Crystal clear strawberry blond liquid with tiny dancing bubbles keep the creamy head afloat a long time. Glass etched all the way down with spider webs.  Smell is all hops: pine, resin, citrus, grass. Well balanced among assertive players.  Taste starts warmly bitter and dry. Wrings your palate like a washcloth. Then lingers long enough for your taste buds to come-to, then slams them again with lingering bitterness, particularly as it slowly dissipates from the palate. There is enough sweet malt to keep this from becoming harsh. Finishes floral & astringently dry. It s just a little too-light bodied, but that's me quibbling.  Overall, this is an incredible peak in the IPA world: lives up to its name as it's hard to pop open lesser beers. This one will be craved. I'm thrilled I was able to find a 6 pack of 12 oz bottles.

147,4083,ColdPoncho,4.12,"Enjoy by 4-10-11. Glad to find this fresh(ish) on the shelf.  A - Crapload of bubbly offwhite head from the first pour...I was being nice, too. Dark yellow body with some bubbles rising. Good lacing.  S - I can smell some pretty killer hops from here...under my nose it's kind of like a bitter pine tree that sprouts light smelling flowers and grows some sweet oranges. or something  T - It's my fault that this isn't very cold, but I can't be blamed for the light bitterness that this beer has. It's also got kind of a muted grapefruit flavor. I thought it would be (i.e. it probably should be) bigger and crazier. Still good. Edit: corked the bottle, stuck it in the freezer, now it's much better. these flavors pop a lot more when cold  M - Somewhat bland and smooth, not so good for the style. Big body, though.  O (D) - Ya know, this is good, and since it had a pretty bad pour and wasn't very cold, I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt. I'll try it again and pour it better, and I'll expect more. As it is, it's a good beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Beautiful creamy foam head one and a half fingers and a nice small layer remains throughout the beer and leaves leaves beautiful creamy lacing with amazing retention. Resiny hops in the nose.

147,4083,jrenihan,4.2,"Beer labelled ""enjoy before"" 04-11-11.  Beer is a translucent golden orange in colour, with a generous finger width of white head that slowly reduces.  Hops are present in the smell, of course. Bitter citrus, grapefruit. Very faint pine smell.  Taste-wise, the bitterness comes through strongly. The citrus is more subdued, but certainly present, grapefruit in particular. The juicy citrus flavours become more pronounced the more I drink it, perhaps as I get more used to the bitterness which was initially almost all I tasted. A floral taste abounds as well. A bit of caramel near the end, but the aftertaste is all bitterness. Alcohol is quite subdued.  As for mouthfeel, it is moderately carbonated, and very nicely medium bodied. Flows around really nicely, feels great to swish around. It really does have a big juicy feel to it.  Overall, a very good beer. The bitterness is almost too much, particularly the aftertaste, which is quite mouth-drying. However, as the bottle progresses, it gets very tasty. I was underwhelmed at the beginning, but it started to open up for me. Very enjoyable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,SWMeyer4141,4.23,"Found this beer very fresh at my local liquor store.  Appearance-Light Golden/Orange color, white head that leaves plenty of lacing, it's nice to just stare at.  Smell-Hops, Grapefruit, Floral Notes, alot like the IPA.  Taste-Hops. 100+ IBUs is no lie, hops are the star. You do get the citrus and floral notes as well. It tastes like a roided up Stone IPA. The bitterness and dryness makes you keep going back for more.  Mouthfeel-Medium bodied with lots of carbonation. Bitterness coats your mouth but the citrus really keeps it balanced.  Overall-Stone says this beer will ""Ruin your Palate"" which is pretty true, don't think I can drink something after this one. I recommend sipping it, especially if your planning on drinking a bomber on your own. As the beers temp rises you get more citrus which is really nice. Great beer to finish the day with.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

A good two finger head recedes to leave a nice lacing around the top of the glass.  S - Strong hop scent, not as piney or flowery as one might like.  T - A very good DIPA. Maybe a little more bitter than I typically like but otherwise very well done. Definitely deserves to be in the top tier of IIPA's.  D - Goes down easy, a little aftertaste from the bitterness, but otherwise an all around tasty beer.  M - Good body and carbonation, no complaints here.  I've definitely rank a couple of IPA's higher on my list than this one. Pliny and Green Flash to name two West Coast and Captain Lawrence and Flower Power on the East Coast.

Has a very sweet caramel background , very very enticing.  T: Hops, hops and more hops!! The taste follows the nose. Has a great grapefuit/orange peely citrus taste that mixes perfectly with the sweet pine notes. Has a great caramel background complimenting all of the hop domination.  M: Medium bodied with just the right amount of carbonation. You get all of the flavors with a drying bitter after taste.  O: This is an amazing beer.

147,4083,hoppyhampy,4.55,"12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass. Best by date is 4/11/11. Pours a bright, slightly cloudy yellow orange with a finger of foam. Nice carbonation. Great lacing. I love the way this beer smells. Lightly sweet and oh so hoppy. Mango, orange peel, and peach. The malt lies submissively underneath it all. It knows its roll. Carbonation is spot on. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Grapefruit and pine flavors play lightly on the palate. Not too resiny so it goes down relatively light and easy. Finish is dry, long, and hoppy. This is where the IBUs get you. Its not until long after you swallow that you feel like you've been chewing on a mouthful of fresh hops. Still one of my favorite DIPAs. I don't know how Stone managed to craft such a hoppy, bitter beer and keep the flavors light enough to make it very drinkable but I'm glad they are keeping it up!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,TheBrewo,4.08,"From our bomber we pour a beautiful brew of golden honey color. Despite a relatively hard pour a minimal one finger head of white bubbles is produced. It recedes at a medium pace, leaving little bits of particulate lace, and a nice film of hefty bubbles across the top of the beer. There is a definite haze to the beer, but no sediment is noted. Carbonation look slowed by the syrupy thickness of the beer. As we sniff, bitter leaf and pine hops hit the nose hard. There is a sickly sweet orange citrus twang floating among them, and earthiness pops through. Malts act to balance the aromas nicely, imparting a bit more sweetness to the bitterness that is the hops. Yeast and a pinch of booze are just palpable over each hop wave. The taste begins with grassy hops that seem, briefly, somewhat floral. Cleanliness and sweetness of malt immediately balance what would otherwise be extreme hop bitterness. The middle shows more bitterness, but it rides tight against the top of the palate. The rest of the mouth is filled with malts and some simultaneously biting and sweet citric character. As the taste rounds out for the finish, earthiness bubbles up. This is, again, from the hops, but also from a faint mineral flavoring prickling the tongue. The aftertaste breathes with sweet and bitter hoppy nectar, with hints of more grassy hops and some booze thrown into the mix. The body is medium and the carbonation is medium. Each sip imparts a thickness to the lips, with a generous coating down the throat with every pass. The mouth, in the end, is left astringently dry, and suckling. The brew is creamy to sip, and nicely palpable. The abv is within range and the beer drinks with ease.  Overall, what we found most enjoyable about this brew was its unabashed hoppiness. Many IPAs and even DIPAs will go lighter on the hop flavoring, while delivering much of it to the nose. Here there is a wonderful amalgamation of taste and aroma, where the flavors and smells seem to match up expertly, making this a contender for the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,CuttDeez,4.35,"A - Beautiful hazy orange yellow color with tiny hints of amber. Very nice white foamy sticky resiliant head and very nice lace. S - very nice aroma of hop, sweet malty pine notes, grapefruit, sweet citrus, and some earthy notes on the back. T & M & D - Great pine sweetness that opens to citrus juice and some pinapple. There is a tiny roast caramel finish to the front end. Then the hop bitterness comes in a great way and finishes the middle taste with a after burn of floral exhale. There is a slightly earthy bitterness and alchohol warmth that sits on the back of the palate after each sip.  Very good and complex IPA that is hopped up but still manages to be balanced and a great all around beer.  -Cheers",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Chill haze clears up as the beer warms. A bit underwhelmed by the smell, more then likely due to age. I pick up grapefruits, and cedar at first. Also there is some alcoholic scents, if you know what I mean. Hop smell diminshes as time passes and im left with malty aromas of fresh dough and a bit of maple. This beer is mighty tasty and more balanced then you might think. Hop flavors have subsided but the bitterness aspect has not. I pick up pine, grapefruit, a cedar wood like taste. I get tastes of vanilla and maple from the malt. There is a pleasing charred taste tha kicks in at the end of each sip, its very nice. This beer clears the palate quickly and leaves a dry taste in your mouth. This beer held up well despite consuming near its best by date.

Sometimes tough to find a fresh bottle but when you do, you most definatley are rewarded.  A - Active carbonation. Lively bubbles from bottom to top of the tulip glass. Clear dark orange in color. Not cloudy. Not so much head or head retention though.  S - Dark oranges, grapefruit, a bit of lemon zest and a nice hoppy scotchy thing going on underneath it all. A bit of earthy pine in the nose as well telling you it's more bitter than most.  T - Follows nose exactly, and yes...a scotchy note along with the citrus hops. Not a palate wrecker.... the 100 IBUs are blended into the profile quite nicely. Not somewhat offensive like a Hopsicle or Mongo. Very pleasing in the finish. Solid DIPA.  M - Very crisp...if it were a tad bit lighter and more grapefruity I'd go as far as saying refreshing. Almost like it wants to get resinous but then the bitterness at the end cleans it out. Solid  D - Good..would be easy to polish off a few of these bombers in a sitting.  Solid example for the style. There are a few I like more but this beer fresh is one I'd never turn down.

A nice frothy, chunky two finger foam cap sits atop and stays for some time. Webs of lacing lie where the head once sat. Decent carbonation too, the beer is mesmerizing.  S- pungent piney hop cone aroma up front, kind of reminds me a little of tree sap. The hops blend with grapefruit, lemon and citrus, the common fruityness in this style. The faintest hint of pale malt brings some faint aroma.  T- Flavor is a bit lemony, and very earthy. I can't quite pick out the usual flavors of a DIPA that much, and the hops aren't that present so maybe it's an old bottle, but there is a big wave of bitterness at the end. Absolutely no presence of alcohol what so ever.  M- The mouth is medium bodied, smooth and a little tingling from the carbonation. Also a little numbing from the bitterness.  D- The alcohol is non existant. The flavor was interesting, and the beer was pleasant on the eyes an the nose. This goes down with almost no effort so I'll give it a 4.5.

147,4083,StoneTSR,4.62,"Wow this was an amazing beer.  APPEARANCE: A different color than most DIPAs, the Ruination poured a yellow, straw-like color and had a very solid, bubbly head that hung in there for a good few minutes. Sadly, only minimal lacing followed the impressive head retention.  SMELL: Despite not having an overpowering aroma, the Ruination seemed to be subtly warning potential drinkers of its intensity with an aroma that was all hops.  TASTE: Bitter, hoppy and delicious. The hops in this beer are bitter and biting, but they make the palate crave even more. They make the palate beg to be pushed further, but Stone did an excellent job of knowing where to stop with this hop bomb. Any more and it might be too much, my palate was pushed to the edge, but didn't fall over it.  MOUTHFEEL: The bitterness seems to build throughout the glass much like a good, spicy food would. Each sip is taste bud ripping to a certain extent, but it always seems to allow the palate to recover. It never goes too far.  OVERALL: Fantastic beer. This is what my hop-loving palate has been wanting for a long time. That said, most normal human beings will not be able to appreciate this beer.

Bouquet is an immediate sweet sense of grapefruits but also balanced malt and wheat bread sensation.  Taste is a nice crawling hop bitterness and great bread punch. Certainly bitter with some lime punch astringency but not as bitter as I expected. Gets a little into pine territory. Taste is all front palate and gets into fruit basket citrus quality.

It's taken about 3/4 of the bottle, but now I am tasting the malt too. Leaves a grassy hop taste in your mouth, a subtle reminder that your palate is being ruined. Drinkability is a tough thing to assess; on the one hand it's beyond hoppy and one bomber is probably enough. On the other hand it's delicious, and if you have been deprived of hops lately then two bombers would be easy to take down. 7.7% ABV makes it easy to dispose of at least two bombers as well.  Overall I like this beer a lot. Not sure I would want to drink it all the time, but it's very good. I will certainly drink it again. Would love to try it on tap.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,veinless,4.5,"Pours an apple juice-like pale, crystal clear light orange yellow, with thick foamy head (about 3 fingers) that laces pretty well and retains for a while. Bubbling is very fine, and after the initial rush to the top, the body of the beer is ridiculously glassy. Excellent appearance.  Aroma is a grapefruit and lemon punch, with nice malt backbone. It isn't sticky or sweet smelling, but rather just a subtle graininess that offers just enough contrast for the hop-derived scents.  Taste is full on hop assault, with grapefruit juice and rind combining with lemon and orange to create an immensely powerful tasting beer. Malt graininess comes in a little bit as in the nose, but promptly gets shoved aside by the hop bitterness that eventually ends up shoving a leafy hop in your mouth for a bitter finish to remember. The citrus of this beer really comes out under the tongue for me, and has a kind of candy feel to it, although it is not exactly sweet.  Mouthfeel is smooth, clean, crisp, and medium bodied. The carbonation is perfect, and the weight of the beer is just enough to keep it from devolving into a watery mess while still teasing the tongue with every sip. Drinkability in this case is a matter of personal taste, as the bitter finish is very strong, but I happen to love that (and judging by the reviews for this, most people do.) Each sip starts out zesty and sparks the flavor cascade to start anew - it really is an awesome beer. Probably has become my go to six-pack for IPAs.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

M: Good carbonation, dances around the tongue with complex tastes. light and smooth  T: A very welcome explosion of citrus and hops.  D: This is a great beer and an equally great representation of it's style. Absolutly makes you want to reach for another one. Highly drinkable despite the fact that it's 7.7%. Stone definitly knows what they are doing!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,IchabodcraneIpa,4.7,"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass.  The color of this beautiful stone brew is a nice pale cloudy gold hue with a nice half inch head of off white foam sitting on the top.  The smell of this one was a piney hop smell with a touch of wood earthiness and some slight alcoholic goodness.  The taste of this one definitely is ruinous to me it starts off with a nice bread like splendor which fades off into a very nicely hopped taste loaded with pine and earthiness. The bitterness never is overbearing, and I was actually not that impressed the first time I tried it but now I stand corrected. This beer has one of the smoothest hop flavors I have ever had and I find it to be perfectly balanced.  The mouthfeel is a dry shot of pine straight to the throat ( but in a pleasant way)  The drinkability of this to me is extremely high and I could see myself drinking 2 or more of these if then opportunity presented itself. The alcohol is really hidden well behind then perfect forest of hop flavor in this IPA.  In conclusion I truly appreciate the flavor of this stone brewing gem and am glad I tried it again. Now I know it is not the beer I thought it was, and that it is actually a truly great brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Appearance: Hazy gold with bright white, creamy head. The head was thin, but could have been poured off the the bartender/server. It did lace, but I don't remember any OMG feelings.  Taste: Super-grassy that turns into woodsy bitterness. Citric hints. The malt is only there to hold it together--practically hop juice.  Overall: Tough to be totally certain. I know I enjoyed it.

One finger white head with some lacing. Very inviting brew to look at.  S: Not extremely aromatic, but the only nose is hops, hops, and more hops. Some grapefruit and orange, maybe some pine and grassy notes.  T: Bitter! A hophead's dream. I haven't had this beer in quite some time and I forgot how many more bittering hops Stone uses with this brew than other DIPA's. The brew starts bitter, a little bit of citrus fruit and pine come through mid-palate, and finishes grassy and bitter. There is not a lot of malt flavor, which works for me.  M: Medium body with a the right amount of carbonation.  D: Might be tough to drink for some due to the high bitterness, but this is a great and readily available beer.

147,4083,airheadmtrcycle,3.33,"Poured from a bomber into a Sierra Nevada pint glass. The color is closer to amber than orange and more clear than I expected. The bubbles keep rising promising a refreshing experience. The head is huge and when it receded it left sticky lacing.  The aroma is dominated by hops with a sweet malt presence. Grapefruit, orange, lemon peel and pine are all present. The hops are even more intense in the flavor. Notes of lemon and sweet malts describe the first couple of sips. The finish is bitter and it lingers until the next sip. At about the end of the pint I felt the flavor was a bit cloying. The citrus element became harder to find and the pine took over. Where did the malts go? When I compare this with the Stone IPA I had on Saturday and the two Hop Slams I had yesterday this is not in that league in terms of good flavor. It's not a balanced hop profile, just more for the sake of more it seems.  The mouth feel is medium and refreshing, but the drinkability is medium to low. I'm getting through the bomber, but I don't want another. Nor will I buy this again.  Is this a bad beer? No. I can see why some people might like it a lot. I like more citrus, less pine, sweeter malt and just better flavor. Of course, taste is subjective.

Leaves a nice bitter aftertaste on the back of your tongue. M - Mouthfeel is full, but not cloying. The alcohol content isn't really apparent but it gives a fullness to the beer that other weaker brews don't have. Still finishes clean though. D - The amount of hops in this is almost too much.

I poured it into a pint glass to reveal the amber glow. The first taste was intense and extremely hoppy, the after taste was excellent and at the same time I wanted more. After the initial shock to my pallet it became very easy and enjoyable to drink.  If your a fan of hops I would suggest giving it a try, this will defiantly enter my regular rotation of drinks!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,CaptDavyJones,4.38,"Poured a clear copper color from a 22 oz bomber, with ABV on the label, into a pint glass. No freshness date on the bottle. Massive, really massive frothy head that doesn't want to go anywhere. Some really good head retention here. Aroma as soon as I cracked the bottle was all hops. Hops, hops and more hops with intermittent pine and citrus coming through. Very faint malt aroma escapes as the beer warmed up. Oh boy, this is a seriously hopped IPA. Feels like the hops are out the ruin your palate. It's hoppy all the way, however, in aftertaste there are hints of sweetness coming through. This is one hell of an IPA. Brutal attack of the hops on the taste-buds. Excellent lacing drapes the insides of the glass. Damn, this is one of Stone's finest brews. This is one of my all time favorite IPA's. A must-try for every hop head. Very highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,bourbonbock,3.95,"Poured a 12 oz bottle into a fresh pint glass.  A. Golden orange with a slight haze and one finger of fluffy white head that reduced to a foam after about two minutes.  S. You can smell the hops running up to your nostrils as soon as the cap is popped. All hops with some yeast aromas in the background.  T. Very complex flavor of hops, perhaps several different strains, with a oiliness, and salt, with some pine and a slight sweet base malt under all of the above.  M. Smooth and creamy with a slight bite to the last bit as it is swallowed almost as if its trying to hang on. It hits on the side of the tongue and sticks near the front for a for a dry finish.  D.

147,4083,weizenbob,4.08,"Stone products do find their way to Michigan but Ruination has eluded me to this point. I received this 12 ounce bottle as an extra in a trade with Azurescens. Thanks Dan. The bottle shows an Enjoy by date of 09/01/10 so I'm going into this with the expectation that this beer has fallen off a bit. However, I did recently have a past-date Arrogant Bastard that was fantastic so you never know.  This bottle was poured into a goblet. I swirled the sediment in the bottom of the bottle and poured that as well. A beautiful two-finger fluffy white head forms. Retention is very good. Thick lacing lines the goblet. The beer is golden colored with enough yeast from the pour to make it as hazy as a wit. That may not be the intended look for this beer, but it remains attractive none the less.  For an eight month old beer the aroma is still hoppy. Mild grapefruit and orange greet the nose. A bready yeastiness follows in the middle. Alcohol is still noted. Subtle clove spiciness lingers toward the end.  I'm going to go ahead and assume that this is not how the brewmaster intended this beer to taste. That is not to say that it is bad, but the ""ruinous effect"" that the label claims the hops will have on my palate has been heavily mellowed by age. Hey, it happens to the best of us. This is a moderately high alcohol brew though so the malt bill has held up nicely. If this had turned out to posses a fowl taste I would have stopped reviewing on the spot as that would not be fair to Stone. As this is still quite enjoyable I will continue.  Caramel flavors coat the tongue, leaving a ""cuddly-puppy effect"" on my palate. There is still a nice hoppy bite in the form of mild grapefruit flavors. A hint of chocolate fades into sweet citrus flavors and still-noticeable alcohol. The finish is still bitter with more earthy grapefruit flavors coming from hop oils that are coating the back of my mouth and throat. It's not ""ruinous"" but I'm still made well-aware that this is a DIPA.  The mouthfeel is pretty spot on. A big malt bill and 7.7% ABV create a body that is on the high end of medium. A good amount of carbonation keeps the beer a little prickly. A few such barbs should be expected from the style.  The drinkability is still pretty high for this beer. The alcohol content is prohibitive to sessioning but I didn't have a problem getting through this one. Taking the beer's age into account my expectations were pretty low, but this bottle of Ruiniation still delivered a lot of the goods. I think most breweries would be proud to call this their fresh DIPA. As such, I still look forward to that elusive fresh sample of Ruination. If this sample held up so well, a fresh bottle ought to be epic.  ---  The Two-Schlitz Scale: (see my profile for an explanation) I would not hesitate to give two Schlitz for an eight-month-old Ruination.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jayhawk73,4.47,"Pours a medium orangish-amber color, with a nice head that sticks around for a little bit. The smell is really good- mostly citrus and hops. Great lacing on the glass. The taste is like a big hop bomb, but it's really good, and amazingly smooth. Citrus, floral, grassy overtones w/ the taste, w/ malt in the background. Mouthfeel is pretty amazing. For such a hopbomb, this beer is amazingly smooth and drinkable. One of my favorites for sure. At 7.7%, it's not going to catch up w/ you either... Stone Ruination is definitely on my short list of DIPA's, the boys at Stone did it again. Cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,CliffBrake,4.03,"Medium orange color, somewhat hazy with a lasting white head that leaves plenty of sticky lacing.  Medium aroma of tangerine and pine.

147,4083,wmtxbb,3.62,"Bottle poured into pint glass  Appearance: Light gold with a thin layer of lacing.  Smell: Sharp foral hops and more hops... basically just hops.  Taste: Hops and bitterness overwhelm the palate. Not a whole lot of complexity from this one. I'm a hop head and I'd prefer something with a tad more complexity. Ends dry with lingering floral/citrus hops.  Drinkability: As with most hoppy brews, this brew is crisp and refreshing, but it lacks complexity.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,dmfrench,4.05,"A sticky, piney, slightly thin but clean and enjoyable DIPA  ---  A: Faded primary yellow body, clear with the slightest hint of haze. Ample carbonation bubbles rising. Somewhat frothy and fairly persistent two finger white head.  S: Big dose of grapefruit hops and a pit of piney hops, rivaling a Three Floyds nose. There's a fair amount of buttery malt underneath, and a certain subtle spiciness. There's just a hint of metal in there somehow (only apparent after tasting), which keeps me from awarding a perfect score. Still, quite a lovely nose.  T: Resiny, piney ass hops hits you first, followed by a pretty large helping of dry, biscuity malt. Finish is again on resiny hops and leaves a pleasant and not overly dry aftertaste.  M: I think just a hair thin, but I'm probably wrong; This is not the biggest of DIPA's.  D: Gets a little heavy toward the end, but still pretty decent.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,eternaljester81,4.52,"Disclaimer: This bottle was about 10 days past its ""enjoy by"" date, but it's my only bottle, so I'm reviewing it. This is the first Ruination I've ever had, so I can't base what taste against what a fresh bottle would present.  A - Right in line with other big IPAs. An aggressive pour lead to a finger-thick cloudy head, which settled into minor lacing. The beer itself is a cloudy orange hue and almost glowing.  S - Sweet, floral hops and fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. There's also a very mild toffee-like scent from either the malts or the alcohol. The smell is a bit subdued, but is still wonderful.  T - Holy hops! If Ruination past its prime can taste like this, I can't even fathom what a fresh bottle would taste like. This is bitter hop bomb with a gin-like pineyness mixed with a grapefruit pithiness. The malts struggle to cut through, but do manage to add a minor sweetness in the swallow. The alcohol is completely hidden.  M - Medium thin, and right on for a slightly smaller double IPA, avoiding the thick, oily feel of its bigger counter-parts.  D - As a hophead, I could drink Ruination all day and night, but the relatively high alcohol would catch up pretty quickly. This is a dangerously drinkable beer if bitter is your thing.  Ruination is only my second beer from Stone, and as a huge hophead, I couldn't wait to try it. I'm nothing if not impressed, and can only hope the rumors of Stone coming to Missouri are true, so I can make this a regular addition to my fridge.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,SteveS1,4.26,"Look: Pours pale amber, one finger frothy white head, average retention, great lacing.  Smell: Glorious hops, very floral. Sweet apricot, orange, and a bit of lemon/citrus.  Taste: Sweet and malty up front, a bit of marmalade, and then hops hops hit like a ton of bricks. A seething beast of hops emerges from the brew coating the palate and base of the tongue. It's grassy, earthy, and is that cement I taste? Bitter hops dominate the aftertaste.  Feel: Medium bodied, average carbonation  Drink: This one is a sipper for me, as IPAs tend to hit me harder than even higher ABV beers. That's not to say it isn't really drinkable, or tasty even. It's very tasty, and you'll want to savor the challenging assault of hops it brings.  The big thing with this beer is that it will catch you off guard with every sip. It really does open sweet and fruity before descending into bitterness.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,LittleDon,4.75,"Everything you could want in an IIPA. The color is spot-on: amber with a very faint haze, a moderate amount of tiny carbonation bubbles, and good head retention with tons of sticky lace. The first whiff is pine with an underlying caramel characteristic. In this bottle, I also perceived a rose or lilac like floral aroma, but that might just be me (or the glassware). Balance is superb, tons of resinous hops with just enough sugar to keep things in check. A bit of carbonation up front, some alcohol in the middle (which quickly fades), and a long bitter finish. With a medium to medium-heavy body what else could one ask for except another (or a draft).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,adamhimself,4.57,"The appearance of this IPA is excellent. It has a slight burnt brown color with a orange tinge. It looks very tasty in my tulip glass.  The smell is amazing. As soon as I started pouring it you could smell the strong hops, which I love. It was a very distinct sweet hop smell. Very citrusy with a slight flowery smell.  The taste is quite nice. There is a strong hop bite upfront, but quickly mellows out to a very nice rich caramel sweetness, but it balances well with the hops. The aftertaste is much like the smell and the upfront taste. Its bitter with flowery and citrusy flavor, I really like it as I prefer stronger hop flavors in double IPAs.  The mouthfeel is standard. Nothing really different, but it is quite smooth and very little creamyness.  I would say this beer has high drinkability. Its on the lower end of the scale for double or imperial IPAs in the ABV department, which make it nice for having a couple. So, I could definitely drink a few of these in a night.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I thought the Stone regular IPA was great.. but man.. this is the best smelling IPA I've ever had the pleasure of putting my nose into.

T - similar to smell aspects of the beer, with malty, sweet, spicy, with the big amount of hoppy bitterness, which is perfect. all the flavor involved blends well together. M - medium bodied, smooth, with slight crisp to it. dry finish with some aftertaste, maybe due to the double amount of hops, but that's just fine! D - very drinkable, if you are not afraid of the hops burning your tongue. seriously, this beer is great! not as great as...but price wise, it's a deal. will be drinking this brew again for sure.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Daniellobo,4.35,"Nice DIPA, not so much bitter as roundly complex, pleasantly hoppy, and very drinkable.  Presentation: 12 oz bottle. Perfunctory and neatly recognizable screen-printed gargoyle design in ocher and green noting name of the brew. Back narrative brags about the nature of the brew, the quality of their craft, and palate numbing profile. No visible freshness or bottling date. Shows Alc. by Vol. (7.7%) and IBUs at 100+.

T - Intense hoppy flavor, resin, citrus, nice malty back, not too big but strong enough with good caramel and a bready sense.  M - Medium to medium-full body with medium carbonation. Some mild stickiness, nice bitterness that accompanies the hops without ever hindering their complexity.  D - Hmmm, if one is into complex lingering hops this works like a charm.  Notes: Nice, nice, this is a revisit after along time, I think, not so sure.

147,4083,bagpiper2005,4.27,"Pour: Light orange-amber color with two and a half fingers of white head that dissipated quickly and left some lacing on the glass.  Smell: WOW! You get a whiff of this as you open the bottle. Hops all around. Citrusy aromas of grapefruit and orange with floral and piney hints as well.  Taste: Syrupy sweet pale malt front end with an understated citrus tone and a touch of molasses. Spicy middle with some hints of sour fruit (lemon comes to mind here). The back end can best be described as a cannon-like explosion of hops: primarily pine with some grapefruit tones. Delicious, but the only thing that keeps it from a perfect 5 is the somewhat prominent alcohol taste.  Mouthfeel: Thick, rich, creamy body. Smooth feel and coats the mouth with a thick layer of hop oil. Medium in carbonation.  Drinkability: Kinda rough going down, and that first sip was especially so. This is definitely a sipping beer.  Final Notes: Yet another impressive beer by the Stone Brewing Company. Their huge beers never cease to impress, and this is no exception. A solid example of the style and one I will return to. Just waiting to be paired with some spicy Asian or Mexican food.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,paulginva,4.32,"APPEARANCE: Pouring from the tap into a pint glass produced a 1/2"" off-white fizzy head with fair lacing that dissipated quickly. There was a moderate amount of carbonation and the body was a clear light copper color.  AROMA: Aroma was a pleasing bouquet of citrus, with a hint of grapefruit and orange and a lingering smell of pine needles. The typical strong hoppy smell of a Double IPA was more attenuated than I expected but was a pleasant reminder of camping in the pine forests of Upper Michigan when I was a kid.  TASTE: Taste mirrored aroma to a large and very pleasing extent. First up was a tantalizing melange of grapefruit and spices then, as that taste began to expire, a surprisingly bracing hops hit reminiscent of pine exploded onto my palate. This pronounced taste lingered for some time.  MOUTHFEEL: This brew had a moderate body and felt very smooth. There was moderate carbonation present and the finish was as bitter as I expected. Flavor was moderately acidic at the beginning and quite bitter but hardly unpleasant at the end. The bitter finish lasted on the middle and back of the tongue for a moderate amount of time. There was a fair amount of body lacing.  DRINKABILITY: I loved this brew. The smashing hit of hops, perhaps the beer's dominant characteristic, is an absolute delight -- a gastronomical achievement that I'm much impressed with. I can't wait to drink it again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Zimbo,4.38,"Every time I look at this bottle I'm reminded of what I drew all over my Physics folder in high school. Sort of embarrassing now.  Anyway, this opened with a pop and compared with Stone's IPA there's more of a muted nose to start which is soon followed by some juiciness and some heavy lingering pine. More orangy in colour than the IPA as well but with more sparkle and clarity too.  An astoundingly supple and very supportive body for the potential weight here. Some very concentrated attacking bitterness that is penetrating (just wave after wave) and stays for the long haul long after the sip is gone. So so dry but relatively carbonic initially as well.  Pretty good, stern, intimidating and firm. What a technical achievement. Could fill 'the stein of truth' many times over with this before I would tire of it but funnily it still doesn't make me salivate the way some other beers do. It is many things to the tongue but for me it just isn't delicious. If it was it would be perfection.  12/8/11 Update  Recently did a Ruination/Hardcore/Tesco American Double IPA challenge and the Ruination, despite being only one day away from its expiry date,was still pretty fine with much more finesse and complexity and a cleaner palate.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Poured lightly for a 2-finger head, reduces to light bubbly film, impressively sticky lacing, color is a typical slightly cloudy amber orange. Aroma is loaded with hops, citrus and grapefruit, and some pine as well. Taste is described the same, but with a well-balanced malt profile, matching perfectly with the hops.

147,4083,pilotgod,4.77,"Growler from brewery poured into Unibroue tulip. From notes on tasting in August 2010.  A: Pours a light copper, that while dark is perfectly clear with no haze at all. Head was initially about one finger, but that quickly subsides to a thin film of bubbles that remains at the center of the glass and on the edge. Lacing is fine, but moderate.  S: Not as in your face with the hops as I expected from a DIPA, but the hops and citrus are there and a noticeable amount of pine needles comes through to give one the smell of hiking through piney woods near a river or stream. The citrus smell is very much like grapefruit with a little orange lingering behind.  T: Unlike most IPA's where the hops are the first to hit you, instead this one waits and takes you off guard. The first taste is of grapefruit like citrus with a little pine flavor following on. As the citrus starts to subside the brewers spices can be detected and about the point you think you might be able to peg which spice or spices it is, the hops come with a mightly blow like the hammer of Thor on your tastebuds. A very bitter taste hits, then runs and leaves that slight bitter feel. That is why I drink IPA's is because I like the taste of hops and that bitterness and Ruination delivers exceptionally with both.  M: With less carbonation than is encountered with other IPA's, Ruination is a little smoother than would be expected. The bitter finish does result in a dry feeling, but that is easily cured by another sip.  D: I love Ruination and grab it every chance I can. I enjoyed the growler, but think I will go with the bottle next time as the carbonation was a bit light and I think this may be improved with the bottle.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Tasting revealed upfront bitterness that lasted through the aftertaste, and sourness upfront. The malt sweetness presented itself near the end which balanced the bitterness well. The flavors of this were somewhat complex, with different flavors and aromas presenting themselves at different times which made it an interesting beer to smell and taste.

Pours a clear amber/copper with a big fluffy white head that falls to thick, sticky curtains of lace. The Aroma is hoppy and sharp, with a bright sting of citrus. The flavor is largely hop - piny resin, deep grapefruit and lemon - but it has a toasty, wheaty malt behind it that balances the hop nicely. At least until that back-end bitterness kicks in - it is satisfying and rich, like sucking on lemon zest, and it lingers long on the finish.

When I cracked the bottle, the air filled with hops aroma. Wow. Citrus, pine, grass. Smells both bitter and sweet.  And then the taste follows through--all hops. I don't know that I've had a beer so overwhelmed by the hops. I taste citrus and pine with some grass, but the bitterness from the hops mutes their flavors. It's a good beer, but the hops come out better in the aroma than they do in the taste.

Big, hard-hitting hops threaten to overwhelm but just as they teeter on the edge of too-muchness they recede somewhat but too much for me to handle. What follows is a candied peach smoothness. The after effects contain much hoppy bitterness but the fruit lingers too. Tingly in the mouth. Smooth and oily thick. Bracingly bitter. Thick, pungent hop aroma however. I'll stick to Stone IPA or Pale Ale here.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Axic10,4.42,"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a tulip glass. Best by 1-26-11.  Appearance: Pours a hazy light pale golden yellow with two fingers of fluffy white head that settles and leaves some nice lacing.  Smell: Very citrusy nose. Pungent grapefruit, some tropical fruits, bitter hoppiness.  Taste: Bitter grapefruit and hops, some tropical fruit and some malty sweetness at the end, but this is a very hop-driven beer.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and dry.  Drinkability: One of my favorite Stone beers that is easily accessible. Not quite the same league as the ""big boys"" but it is a very very enjoyable beer that I'm never disappointed by.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,andrewinski1,4.32,"Poured into a tulip. Best by 02-29-11. Nice hazy orange color with a bit of sticky lacing left by a one finger head.  The aroma is very citrusy. It smells like orange candy; like one of those orange slices. Maybe a bit of thyme also. Good strong aroma on this one.  The taste is dry from start to finish. Very bitter on the finish. Notes of grapefruit are very prominent. Actually, the aftertaste reminds me of grapefruit zest. Near perfect balance for the style.  The carbonation is nice and lively on this one; bringing out more bitter flavors.  This is a benchmark example of the style. I will always get it when fresh.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,KingPuuChuu,4.23,"Wow.  This is an intense beer.  From bottle, into Goblet. Initially, there is not a lot of foam, but what is there is exceptionally fragrant.  Extremely floral.  First sip is intense, heavy ""bitterness"" is deliciously floral and hoppy. As the bottle says, it's not for the beginning IPA drinker.  Surprisingly fresh on the palate, and definitely leaves a heavy floral aftertaste. No dryness, and is alcoholic, but not too much. I'm enjoying sipping this beer right now.  Swishing the beer reveals some tart grapefruity flavors, but not too much.  This is a fantastic beer, but I would recommend one bottle at a time.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BeerBuckeye,4.1,"A - Pours a hazy orange, off-white head with some lacing  S - First scent was a lot of hops. Some scents of orange peel underneath. A deeper smell reveals some hints of pine and floral. Very nice.  T - A full amount of bitterness. Definitely a heavy floral taste, not unpleasant. A little hint of fruitiness in there, even some of that orange that was smelled. I almost sensed a little bit of smokeyness on the finish.  M - Very fresh. Lightly carbonated, for as bitter as the beer is, it doesn't really leave the mouth feeling dry. A bit of alcohol on the aftertaste. Balanced fairly well.  D - It's a strong beer. The aftertaste leaves a bit of lingering alcohol, so I found myself sipping this beer and waiting for the next draw  Overall - Certainly not a weak beer. I decided to take my time with this beer and enjoyed it quite a bit. The alcohol is a little strong in the taste, but not overwhleming. Overall, quite good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,cmq103,4.59,"I was first exposed to this on draft at the 2009 Sippin by the River event at Festival Pier at Penn's Landing in Philly. This was the best beer served there by far that day, prompting me to reminisce by buying several 22oz bottles this week to sip and enjoy at home.  A: This was poured into a Sam Adams Perfect pint glass for review. The hazy copper color was appealing, as was the moderate size off-white head. Spotty lacing clung to the sides of my glass as it emptied.  S: This is one of the best smelling DIPA's that I have encountered. Strong citrus, hoppy, grapefruit aroma. I truly enjoyed inhaling this with each and every sip. Top notch for Stone!!  T: My palate was assaulted by massive hop flavors, exactly what I expected and wanted from a DIPA. Wow!!! Pine and juicy grapefruit flavors follow the initial hop bite, finishing with a slight malty, nice hoppy backend bite.  M: Very smooth mouthfeel with a perfect level of carbonation to titilate the tongue.  D: Every anticipated sip led to me wanting more and more. Sure it's not the typical session beer with the higher, very well hidden ABV. I could easily find myself having two or three of these in one sitting without feeling the least bit guilty about what I paid per bottle. Outstanding beer and must try for DIPA fans!!! One of the top five in DIPA's in my opinion.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Pungent grapefruit, light floral and hoppy goodness. The taste is a grapefruit blast followed by a hop bitterness that lingers into the aftertaste. Very long finish. Non-hophead's please look elsewhere. While there is a lot of in your face bitterness this is quite drinkable. 7.7% enables multiples and the beer is great which makes me want more. I know this is a little pricey for a sixer or bomber but in the end it is well worth the dinero. Great stuff.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,beerprovedwright,4.65,"This brew will cause my ruination. One finger head of white foam, some lace, but little cling. Color gets the rating better, lovely hazy 7 on the SRM chart, looks very drinkable. Smells are aromas of more citrus than is in the book. Taste are flavors of lime, lemon, orange, grapefruit, pine, pine wood...bark, earthy nodes. Full of bounce in my mouth, filling, creamy. Great bitter beer...but I chew on lemons. More for my pleasure.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,rfabian,4.2,"Poured into a tumbler it produces a half inch of suds with good lacing of the glass. The appearance is cloudy and golden. The aroma is strong with citrus hops. The taste is lightly malty and strongly bittered with hops, 80 IBU at least. The body is medium heavy with a clean finish.  This is an excellent imperial IPA, highly enjoyable. I'll be looking for it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Chaney,4.03,"A: Poured a very cloudy bright orange color with about a finger's worth of solid, marshmallow-like head that melted down to a mere ring around the brew within seconds. Beautiful!  S: Not totally in-your-face, but a nice citrus scent of grapefruit, orange, and a good bit of hops. There was a nice fruit (almost candy) sugar presence as the beer warmed.  T: This was a tongue bruiser and then some. All 100 IBUs attacked my palate at once and didn't let go. The bitterness reminded me of the same sort of taste one gets from biting into an unsweetened chocolate bar. I don't believe that was alcohol that dried my palate on the finish...  M: Like I stated, extremely bitter, but the nice bubbly carbonation aided somewhat in cutting it. Not much sugary-syrupiness here which I appreciated.  D: It said on the bottle to store at cellar temperature. I know this is an IPA, but if you're looking for a more mellow experience, you might want to leave it in there for a bit. This was a brew designed by hopheads to please more hopheads.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Smell is tinny and subtle, some pine, slightly spicy hops. Taste is mostly bitter hops backed up by a bit of alcohol. Some pale malt but overall a very dry beer. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a medium carbonation. Not a bad beer, but not the Ruination I remember. I would buy the bomber again, but there are much better beers available in 6 packs that I would take a pass on this in the future.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,GarthDanielson,4.55,"On cask at the Stone Brewery. I got pretty excited about this, because Ruination is my favorite offering from Stone.  The beer is a briht, cloudy golden color. It pours from the cask with a 1 and a half inch foamy, light, white head. The nose is a blend of pine and hops, a little heavier to the pine scents. The beer is much smoother on cask, with heavy hops undertones. There is a bitter aftertaste, with an extremely smooth finish. The cask not only smooths out the beer itself, but also brings out the pine flavors that are more muted in the draft version. Very good beer!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,frognot,4.35,"Appearance: Pale gold with a huge fluffy white head.  Smell: Lotsa pine, lotsa citrus to get your attention  Taste: Crisp, clean with a very strong bitterness that Stone balances perfectly with the right amount of malt.  Mouthfeel: Very crisp with nice carbonation.  Drinkability: Very drinkable but that 7.7% ABV will sneak up on you. Also, this much flavor will fill you up fast.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,cudmud,4.23,"Appearance: An amazing copper color with a ton of white, rocky head, which produces loads of lace. A very pretty beer.  Smell: Lots of citrus and floral notes. Very pleasing to the nose.  Taste: Plenty of malt flavors on the front of the tongue and follows with a blast of hops, and concludes with hoppy bitterness. The flavors are layered and balanced.  Mouthfeel: Full body and thick. You can slice the hops like ther're a fine piece steak.  Drinkability: A tasty beer and a treat for all fans of hops. Fantastic beer that's not a brewer's dare based on too much alcohol and hops. What all IPAs should be.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BB1313,4.24,"12oz bottle poured into a standard pint glass. I've always been a huge fan of this beer. Pours a wonderful light golden-honey w/ nice white head and nice lacing. Blast of floral aroma, lots of citrus and pine. Lemon and lime zest. Grapefruit rind. Tastes pretty bitter, but very balanced with a touch of caramel malt sweetness. Finishes dry, but slightly juicy. This beer definitely packs a punch at 7.7%, but it's very drinkable, due to its great flavor.  This is a classic Stone brew! Amazingly similar to Stone IPA, just amped up. Very enjoyable, highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,LuthersMug,4.02,"A - Muted orange-yellow and a little cloudy. Looks delicious, ambrosia came to mind. A smaller head that didn't last that long. Decent lacing.  S - Best aspect of the beer. Very refreshing, citrusy and floral.  T - As the label says, the hops hit the senses. Very fresh, citrusy, piney. The hops are bitter, a bit metallic, but not so overpowering that you can't enjoy it.  M - Good carbonation and balanced nicely, all the flavors work together.  D - Definitely and IPA you can have more than one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Orange grapefruit tropical fruits. T: Just what the doctor ordered. Huge bitterness from begining to end. Citus and tropucal fruits again. Touch of sweetness. M: Light creamy body. Great lingering bitterness. D: SCARY Drinkable! @ 7.7 ABV this one is very drinkable.  This is a Top 3 DIPA for me when fresh no doubt.

Citrus and piney. Perhaps some slight flowery hops.  T.  A Very bitter IPA. Similar to nose. Citrus rinds and resiny pine with a huge malt finish. I've had better IPAs, but this one is still good.  M.  about medium bodied with lots of carbonation. A little dry finish and a slight resiny mouthfeel.  D.  A bomber is a little too much for me. One glass and I'm good.

Hops way up front, bitter and dry and crisp. I can taste the alcohol somewhat in the aftertaste but it doesn't linger to long.  This should be a standard for any Hop-Head, IPA fan. Stone always comes through with great beers. Cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,CHickman,4.45,"Pours cloudy orange in color with a creamy 1 finger thick off white head that faded very slowly and left great lacing with rings down the glass. Good looking beer that is par for the course for most Stone products.  Smells of huge hops, including grapefruit, floral hops, piney hops, citrus hops, sweet malt, flowers, caramel, orange peel, lemon zest, grapes, grass, light alcohol and sweet fruit; what a tasty smelling beer.  Tastes like it smells with a huge blast of grapefruit and orange zest up front, followed by floral hops, piney hops, tangerine, citrus hops, sweet malt, flowers, caramel, pineapple, lemon, grapes, graham cracker, grass, toffee and a mild spicy alcohol burn that brings a little heat and some spices like pepper, cinnamon and coriander. The malts show up for balance, but the hops dominate and the alcohol shows but is not a distraction. A very hoppy beer that's pretty spicy, but spicy in a good way and full of complex flavors.  Creamy mouthfeel, that's oily and smooth, with a medium body that's a little chewy and has light carbonation; this is very smooth considering how aromatic and flavorful this beer is, and how well it hides the ABV. Always delivers the right amount of bitterness that trails off slightly grainy mixed with hop oil juicyness.  The drinkability was high for me, as I'm a hophead and love most of the Stone products. If you're looking for a great, almost taste-bud numbing IPA that you can quaff down and get a buzz from, then this is your beer; it always delivers - always!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BigBlacke,4.2,"Ruination pours a light brownish orange with a 1 finger head that dissipates quickly but leaves a nice spiderweb lacing. Smell is of piney hops with bready malt. Taste is a smack to the face of piney and citrusy hops. There is also a delicious malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is very crisp with a linger oily hop residue. The aftertaste sticks with you. I find drinkability to be quite high, but I dont believe an hop novice would. Delicious!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,CheckmateBrew,4.32,"A - nice two finger head and light brown color. A very nice start. Besides you gotta love the Bottle art, too bad it is painted on and I cannot use it for homebrew. lol  S - Wow, you can really smell the hops coming thru on this one and for the style it is very good. Cant wait to taste at this point.  T - Excellent balance but the hops rule this brew. One of my current favorites is the Terrapin Rye Pale Ale, and this one beats it in flavor.  M - Nicely carbonated, good for the style  D - I am going to have to support Stone and buy a few more of these. Perfect for that hot day at the beach!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,keith712,4.47,"22oz bomber poured into a hefeweizen glass.  Appearance: cloudy hot amber, with a big fluffy head that dissipates in 1-2 minutes to a solid 1/2"" layer. The bottle has some sediments on the bottom that I will sample.  Nose: Bright citrus hoppiness! Grapefruit, orange peel. Did I mention the bright hops kick? Some sweetness hiding in there, smooth.  Taste: A massive bitter kick, one only an IPA drinker could love! The hops totally dominate this beer and beat the other flavors into submission. As it warms a little, a dry smoky caramel presence comes out from the malts, but the bitterness of the kick ass hops just stay like a bad neighbor (or a good neighbor in this case).  Mouthfeel: Medium thin, medium low carbonation. The hops leave a massive after taste that stays and stays, and a coating on the inner cheeks that is simply wonderful.  Drinkability: Rated at 7.7% ABV, you would not know it, the hops over ride any alcohol presence. I could drink this repeatedly but the ABV will catch up with you.  Overall I rate this way up in the IPA's I have tasted. If there is a better one I can't wait to find it. 9.5 of 10. Beginner IPA drinkers beware, you either will love the IPA's after this, or avoid them completely :-)",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,DefenCorps,4.5,"Bottle, best by Jan 27th 2011, which puts this at about 6 weeks. Fresher than I've seen in a while, so I had to grab it.  Pouring darker than I remember it being, this beer is a clear, bronzed color with a dense off-white head with excellent retention and beautiful lacing. The nose is just wonderful. Bright citrus with lemons and oranges, there's a mild candied orange character as well. A delicate, peppery spiciness is present as well, along with a light earthy hop character. Moderately floral as well, there's some almost jasmine-like aroma present. An excellent expression of hops, there's a touch of caramel and biscuit to round out the nose.  The palate opens with a pleasing, pungent bitterness with pine needles, juicy grapefruit and quite a bit of flavor with citrus and pine again. Unlike some other San Diego-style IPAs, this leans a little heavier on the bittering hops, and is all the better for it. Juicy and resiny, this is pretty excellent. Again, the sweetness is low, but substantial and complex enough to add a lot to this beer. Mild caramel and mildly toasty/biscuit-like, it perfectly accents the hops. While this beer is light in body, the oily, resiny character does make it seem bigger than it is, and the moderate carbonation make for an excellent beer. I was supposed to savor this, but damn, did I inhale it. Exceptional stuff, I will drink this more often, despite the rather high price.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Fatehunter,4.13,"A - Poured out of a 22oz bottle into a tall flute. Cloudy golden color, still opaque with an inch and half of clean-white head.  S - Lots of floral and citrus scents; mostly grapefruit and a little pear.  T - There is no doubt that this is an IPA from Stone. The bitterness just claws in and does not let up until minutes afterward. It is difficult to find any other flavor in here; perhaps a little malt sweetness buried in there, but it is still really good.  M - Light moving towards medium body with moderate carbonation. A slight smoothness to it also.  D - Very drinkable if you know what you are getting into; this is not an entry level IPA. Hops dominate.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Cheesemoose,4.53,"12oz bottle into my tulip.  A toasty amber hued yellow on the pour. Pillowy white head that rises high, giving a good 3 fingers of head. Recedes into a nice film with a solid bit of lacing.  Pine and citrus hops nose leap from the glass. Malt base is solid, giving a candy like presence that is just lovely.  Bitter start. Hops come into play fast and hard. Starts with a pine/citrus hop character. The finish sees a malt backing, though it is in the background. Malts are toasty, adding a mild caramel sweetness. This one is solely a hop monster. Finish is great. As you breathe out you get a resurgence of the lingering hop flavors bringing back all that once was. This one does not go down lightly.  Mouthfeel is rather smooth, with a light syrupy nature. ABV is felt more than sense. Mild warming and definitely a sipper.  A great DIPA and a must.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S: Pine hops, bready malty, citrus, some flowery esters. smells really intense and inviting.  T: Holy hop! A surge of pine and citrus hops quickly backed by rich malt, almost a resin taste, esters in the finish. It's pretty bitter, but decently smooth. Has a fruit sweetness like a tangerine, alcohol is present in the finish but isn't overwhelming.  M: Medium carbonation, full body, very chewy and sticky.

Fairly earthy as well, with notes of citrus rind. A small malt backbone rounds it off, but it's still on the bitter side by quite a margin  M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation that gets held off by all those hop oils  O: A great example of the style, and a hop monster for sure, especially fresh (this one is only a month old).

S-Catty, onion powder, wonderful, I can smell it from a foot away while pouring into the glass.  T- Some sweetness and citrus at the beginning then overwhelmingly bitter on the finish. I almost get some saltiness from the bitterness, maybe it is something I ate? Still good but wow is it bitter.  M- Nice body, seems to have a low finishing gravity.

Pours a great, sticky head with good retention and wonderfull spiderweb lacing.  Smell is hoppy and even a little malty but that might be a yeast/bread smell. Some citrus of course.  Taste is good, but still not overly hoppy. I've yet to find a Hop beer that overwhelms my palette, and this one doesn't either. I beleive its still balanced, not too dry and not too spicy. There are some floral notes too. Typical hop bite on the backend but not too much.  Mouthfeel is ok-to semi-good, initally crisp. A little dry maybe? Slight alcohol presence.  Drinkability is good in my opinion for an IPA. Goes down clean.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The hop aroma is perfumy and tropical, but it blends well with the bready malt character.  T. It is hoppy, but not as hoppy as I had expected. The hop taste is more fruity than perfumy, but it is still tropical. The taste moves from hoppy, to dry, to the bready/ doughy taste of the malt. Not overly bitter.  M. This beer is a little dry with medium mouthfeel and may be a little under-carbonated. The alcohol is nice as it helps accentuate the flavors of the beer.  D.

147,4083,Lucklys,4.17,"It poured a hazy burnt golden-orange that was randomly scattered with tiny streams of carbonation. It held a gorgeous two-finger thick, creamy, milky white head shaded with buttery hues that lasted quite a while thanks to its excellent retention, and left lovely sticky lace in sheets along the glass. A nice collar formed around the edge as the foam dissipated and the liquid beneath cleared of the initial haze to a glassy orange amber as it warmed.  The nose was very pungent with lots of pink grapefruit juice and crushed pine needle hops that threatened to sting my nose, but at the same time seemed softly floral (thanks to the Centennial hops), keeping it perfectly balanced. Once my senses were wide awake, which took only one or two whiffs, there were some very mild sweet malts that presented themselves in the background. Hints of light lemon zest and maybe something pineappley, dried grass and hay spyhopped their way through the strong grapefruit and pine somewhere along the line, too, though more so as the beer warmed. Throughout the time I took just holding my nose over my snifter, the aroma never lost any of its spice or zest and remained hop central til the very end. Blissful and sinus clearing!  I started a relationship with Ruination and while the passion-filled riptide of extreme hops immediately overwhelmed me, it slowed down as the first sip reached my stomach, leaving a long-lasting piney bitterness holding onto my taste buds for dear life. Each sip afterward was continuously filled with dramatic pine needles and grapefruit rind hops and never left me disappointed (until I finished the beer, of course). Undertones of sweet pale malts rolled out from under all the hops for the briefest moments right at the end, forming an arching backbone just looking for a good, quick scratch before being washed over by a final wave of lemon peel and herbal resin. The mouthfeel was consistently medium, especially with the rich flavors, and was rather silky and creamy even with the good amount of spicy carbonation. It wasn't exactly smooth, but it was easy to drink and really quite delicious.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,zhanson88,4.4,"Served from a bottle with an enjoy by date of 12/16 into a tulip glass.  Appearance: Ruination pours a bright, clear golden color with a full two fingers of eggshell white head. Retention is fantastic, and resulting lacing is chunky and fairly open.  Smell: Huge waves of citrus and grapefruit waft from this beer, absolutely mouthwatering. Piney hops follow, but are almost an afterthought after all of that citrus and grapefruit. I can also get some estery-type scents as well.  Taste: I can't imagine a DIPA tasting much better. I get just a bit of malt, and a ton of grapefruit and a bit less citrus start up front. Following is tangy, bitter hop flavor. More bitterness accentuates the finish.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Just under medium bodied and very smooth. The carbonation feels very good in the mouth. This beer is bitter in the extreme, but I still find it pretty damn drinkable. Drinking a full bomber will wreck the palate, however.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,spinrsx,4.1,"Bomber  Appearance - The beer pours a hazy gold/amber colour with a nice size frothy white head. There is an average amount of carbonation, and the lacing on the sides of the glass is excellent. The head lasted for quite a while before it began to dissipate.  Smell - Pine, breads/grains, grapefruit, tangerine, and a woodiness  Taste & Mouth - There is quite a bit of carbonation on the tongue, and the beer feels dry yet creamy. The flavours include grapefruit zest, a breadiness, and pine. There is also a lot of hop flavour mixed some nice floral notes. The beer finishes with a bitter hop aftertaste.  Drink - A solid beer that I would be happy to drink again anytime. Worth checking out if you happen to see it on the shelves.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

M - Nicely carbonated with a slight, tart-pucker.  D - At 7.7% ABV, too big to pound, but just right to savor.

Nice clean bitterness from hops, balanced by a huge dallop of sweet and toasty malt.  M-sticky, and super heavy in body, but not over carbonated.

147,4083,afksports,4.5,"Had this bottled and then on tap at Amity Hall. I figure Black Friday before I run over to Capone's is probably a good time to sneak in a review from notes.  It's heady with an golden and orange haze. Great little bubbles of lacing hug the glass as it goes down. Above the murky goodness it smells like straight and strong citrus hops, with a bit of a malts coming though too.  Taste is what you want when you order a WC hop bomb. Bit of temperance on the hops with some caramel, and overall it's well-crafted. It's got a solid medium body and great carbonation to really fill the palate, and a low enough ABV to be regularly drinkable.  Although I wouldn't be putting back 5 of these. At risk of losing all taste sensation in my mouth for weeks. Regardless - another great one, Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

This tastes just like a DIPA should taste.  M - This has a medium and good carbonation. There is also a nice crispness to it. The flavor of the hops sticks to the mouth and lingers for a while, leaving a little bit of a puckering feel.  D -This has great drinkability. I could drink these all the time.

Lacing clings to the glass as the beer is drank.  Aroma is tremendous, huge, piney juicy hops. Nothing else in the nose, but what can you expect at 100+ ibu. As the beer is drank and the head dissipates the malt comes through a bit.  Taste is exactly what you would expect on a west coast ipa with that many ibus. Huge hop flavor up front, sticky, resinous hops. Malt is there, but damned if I can pick it out with all those hops. Big bitterness in the finish and aftertaste. Hop heads wet dream.  Mouthfeel is highly carbonated, almost creamy. Good weight, good carbonation.  Drinkability is surprising with this amount of hops.

147,4083,dpnelson1978,4.1,"12 oz. bottle into glass pint. 40°F  $1.99 / ea.  A: Bright copper body topped with a rocky off-white two-finger head of moderate retention that leaves behind thick sticky lace and a big rocky cover.  Note: A big ass fly also happened to float to the top after I poured. Yeah, it came out of the bottle. Pretty gross, but most likely a rare occurrence.  S: Big grapefruit citrus and pine aromas over a sweet caramel backbone. Prototypical West Coast IPA. Simple, but wonderful.  T: More balanced than the aroma suggested. Starts off with big sweet caramel malt flavors, transitions into hot and grassy flavors, and then finishes with a strong hop bitterness. Each drink is a journey. Very interesting.  M: Medium body and heavy carbonation. Strong carbonic bite and defined hop oil smoothness.  D: Really nice flavors, but at 7.70 abv this isn't something to over indulge. Have one before and during your meal and then take it easy for a bit. Not a craft beer for ""beginners"".  O: Right in Stone's wheel house and they wasted no time knocking it out of the park.

Hops - overwhelming (not in a bad way). Pine and grapefruit notes as well. Sweet citrusy aroma as well. One of the best aromas I've had.  Taste follows the aroma, but with some sweet malty flavor backing up the piney hops. That's what makes this taste work so well; it's got a great strong bitter hop flavor but balanced well enough with sweet malt to enjoy.  You can't drink too many of these without the ruination of your palate, which detracts from the drinkability.

The smell was of Pine and a variety of strong hoppy aromas.

Hops definitely the largest contributing factor to this beer and kinda hard to extract lots of other flavors through it. it had the Perfect bitter taste to it (not a killer, very pleasant) More smooth and sweet than i would have expected, The hops bring out very herbal notes in this beer. the aftertaste is also dry and quite bitter as well. Mouth-feel is very pleasing. medium bodied with the perfect amount of carbonation for this beer. leaves you feeling very warm.

The heavy pine smell also has some citrus, but not as strong as some other IPAs.  t - The first gulp is almost too much. Super hops. The sides of your tongue feel like they've been jabbed with pine needles. Then you acclimate to it. If you're into hops, its a winner. If you're not, what are you doing drinking a double IPA?  m - Pretty light and crisp, not much substance.

Not nearly as bitter as I was expecting (from the smell or the label's ""100+ IBUs"" boast).  M - Oily and medium-bodied. Carbonation is present but not incredibly assertive.

I know Stone derides ""fizzy yellow beers"" but that's certainly the appearance here. Golden with a one finger head.  Initially quite bitter, with a predominately pine resin bitterness to it. As far as hoppiness goes, it's up there with the most bitter of DIPA's but probably not THE most bitter. There's a little malt sweetness that peeks through...a hint of biscuit. Again though, pretty secondary here. A pretty decent resiny finish to it, lasting a bit into the aftertaste and beyond. Not unpleasant.  Pretty good, though I do like a bit more balance in a DIPA.

147,4083,yeahnatenelson,4.21,"Appearance -- Pours a bight cupric orange with a slender sludsy head. Head retention is pretty woeful. Lacing also a bit lacking. Not thrilling, but I know it's all better from here on in.  Smell -- Okay, things are picking up now: Pine resin and citrus by the bushel. Big grapefruit and tangerine notes so bright and sweet that they are almost perfumy. Also present is that signature mineral aroma that seems to be a trademark of Stone's brews - I'm convinced it's the water. Malts akin to biscuit and honey. Also some buttery diacetyl, but not at Alpine levels.  Taste -- The nose knows: grapefruit pulp, tangerine, and lemon zest float above a baseline pine resin and leafy vegetal bitterness. Malts temper the resin with caramel and honeyed biscuit. Faint diacetyl lends a bit of additional richness to the malts. Again, that trademark mineral flavor makes itself known. Finish is pine resin, grapefruit must, and a bit of leafy vegetal bitterness.  Mouthfeel -- Medium in body with medium carbonation that's both lively and gentle. Immensely drinkable.  Drinkability -- This is what immediately comes to mind when I think of West Coast IPA's, even though it's considered a DIPA. While it might not be the standard bearer of it's style, cough-Pliny-cough, but it's certainly one of the archetypes. Amazing aroma, good hop profile. Total hop-head maker.

Hoppy aftertaste even after a minute or two, along with some faint fruit flavoring. This beckons for hop heads.  M- extremely smooth, and surprising amount of body.

It pours a clear, medium amber with a finger of white head with nice retention and good lacing.  S - Aroma is wonderful. Grapefruit and pine hops and bit of grassyness. I can also just pick out a bit of bready malt character. Big hop bomb.  T - Oh it's all about the hops, sure, but there's still a nice malt character. First you taste a slight sweetness that's gone quickly, next come the strong pine and citrus hops, followed by a hint of bready malts. Finally you are left with a bitter hoppyness that stays with you for a very long time. It's phenomenal.  M - Thin to medium body that has very nice carbonation. It feels exceptional, really. The body fits the style perfectly and the carbonation compliments it well.  D - If you're a fan of DIPAs, you will love to drink this beer. That said, the bitterness and strong hoppyness will undoubtedly turn off many drinkers. Even as a huge fan of IPAs and DIPAs I probably wouldn't drink more than one in an evening, and I'd make it my last beer, because the bitterness does indeed dominate your palate. This is not a negative, just a reinforcement of the warning on the bottle. A wonderful beer, but with so much hop it takes some effort to drink.

The smell is that of citrus and grass hops with a small bready malty undertone. The taste is not dominated by the hops that the smell begs you to think. This beer is wonderfully balanced with bready bisucuity malts and warming alcohol with nice citrus/piney hop undertone. Not a bitting or bitter taste but a clean smooth balance between malt and hops has almost a creamy smooth mouthfeel. The drinkability of the strong IPA is very pleasant and I could easily have more than just one.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Smell is amazing. Apple and citrus hops dominate.  Flavor is off the charts. I had been expecting a fierce bitterness, given the 100+ IBUs, but the hops aren't overbearing at all, nicely balanced within caramel malt, until the hops snap in at the end.  Drinkability is rather amazing, given the IBU and ABV. I could suck these down one after another, though I might regret it in the morning.  This is one of the few IPAs I've had that I honeslty enjoyed almost as much as a Pliny. For me, this easily beats out Sculpin and any number of other contenders. Damn.

T - Much like the nose, there was a great bitter hop fun time thing working here. The Juicy Fruit gum smell wasn't as sweet in the taste, but came through in straight up citrus presence.  M - Medium carbonation and somewhat light. The bitterness that the Gargoyle warns us of does indeed stick to the tongue. Halfway through the bomber I heated up some Mexican food on a hunch, and sure it enough, it was a great match.

147,4083,thebrood1987,5,"You can smell this as you pour it... It has a very strong grapefruit citrus and a touch of pine in the smell. This is more grapefruity smelling as opposed to the regular Stone IPA which I picked up more citrus and pine on the nose. As soon as you drink it you get a very quick flash of sweetness and then pine sap, tree like bitterness mixed in with that citrusy grapefruit flavor just hits the middle of your tongue and lasts long on the back end of the tongue. Wow... what a beer. This is a more pungent version of their regular IPA.  They have similar tastes but this one comes out with more of a grapefruit smell taste and bitterness but still holds the same citrus pine like character as the regular Stone IPA has. The lasting bitterness can really prove this IPA or double IPA is really the real deal here. When everyone talks about American IPA this should be the very first one they mention. This is a hop bomb but thats not to say theres some malty full body sweetness in there which there is at the very beginning of the sip.

The finish is a little strong, but beyond that it's a very good IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,GDBEERMAN,4.78,"12oz bottle into snifter: from notes. A: A deep hazy is poured within this burnt orange body. The color is a very deep representation of how an IPA should look. The white head pours a two finger thickness, and holds into a substantial layer throughout. The lacing is next to completely thick on the glass.  S: The aroma is a perfect blend of grapefruit and pines, many other citrus flavors are also subtle in the aroma. The aroma is a medium to high intensity and is very layered in the complex features.  T/M: The first thing that hits me when I drink this beer is the thick and creamy mouthfeel, it is a mouthful. The bitter flavor are instant and work a very powerful effect on the complexities of this brew. Starting with a nice and fruity punch, it moves on to a herbal tone that prolongs the lingering finish. This is a benchmark in the IPA class, and I feel one that all others are compared to.  D: Very drinkable, the key flavors and overall killer taste, make this one a classic for the style. A bit high in price, but still a really classic brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,pmlondrigan,3.81,"Hazy golden orange hugh with a nice white head which fades to a ring that clings to the glass leaving some rather nice lacing. The beer is kind of opaque. Juicy hop blast to the nose. Balanc of pine and citrus, bit of fruityness. A hop assualt on the tongue. Combo of resinous pine, citrus hops on the palate matched with a super bitter hop finish. Clearly a good bit of crystal malt flavor going on. If there is such a thing as a regular mouthfeel this has got it. Because of the high bitterness I'm not sure how much of this I can put back, but it sure is good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,shand,4.23,"Poured from a bomber into an imperial pint.  Appearance: Pours a deep golden color a massive head. I did a pour right to the center of the nick on my imperial pint, and the head went to the top of the glass. Excellent retention and lacing, this is a perfect looking beer.  Smell: Oh god, I smell hops. Wonderful wonderful hops. There's a bit of citrus (grapefruit in particular_ and I can smell just a bit of alcohol and malts in here.  Taste: This tastes fantastic going straight down. It's very hoppy and citrusy, and is a gorgeous example of the style. However, the aftertaste definitely has some unmasked alcohol that takes a few points away. Don't let it warm up to room temperature, or this aspect just gets worse.  Mouthfeel: It's fairly light and lightly carbonated - works well with the grapefruit character.  Drinkability: The aftertaste of alcohol dings this a bit here, it's otherwise well drinkable. Sipping it helps with that problem.  This is a great DIPA that's widely available for semi-reasonable prices (I got this bomber for 7 bucks with tax). A good introduction to the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,JWU,4.15,"Poured into a glass from 12oz. bottle  A - huge, fluffy, beautiful head. One the more deep golden side of amber.  S - Very piney and citrusy hops with sweet malts in the background.  T - The taste is more citrus than pine, but both are there. Has a very excellent pineapple type taste in the middle as well. Sweet malts try to come through, but are beated into submission by the hops. The best part is that even though it's a hopsfest, it's not BITTER. Proof that excellent hoppy beer doesn't need to be crushingly bitter.  M - Medium Carbonation, medium mouthfeel, ends dry, but quite crisp and refreshing.  D - It's a sipper, but went very well with my meal of dry aged new york strip steak!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Medium body in the mouth, nice tight carbonation more fuzzy than biting. alcohol warmth is mild.  Drinks easy. Hops, fruits, malts blend well. Ends dry on tip of tongue.

147,4083,DanOLeary,4.2,"Aroma: Moderate levels of orange peel hop aroma with some pepper thrown into the mix as well. Quite resinous throughout the nose, but not unbalanced or undesirable. Malt is hidden but you can pick up some bread crust if you look past the hop cones.  Appearance: Deep golden to nearly orange with a well retained, but thin, white head. The beer is quite hazy which makes you expect a yeast presence, though I suspect it is from dry-hopping. Good lacing down the sides of the glass.  Flavor: A sting of hop bitterness right off the bat, then there is just a touch of bready-malt sweetness coming through for a moment. More orange peel and grassy hop bitterness and flavor come through in the middle and they hold on to the bitter end.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with medium to high carbonation. The prickly sensation of extreme amounts of hop bitterness could be perceived as carbonation in a way. Hops attack the tongue and back of the throat with bitterness that both cleans the mouth dry, yet leaves an oil in your mouth that continues to spew bitterness long after the beer flows down the throat.  Overall: The hop aroma in this beer oddly doesn't fully give the full story as to just how bitter this beer truly is. It has a beautiful hop nose, but the bitterness and flavor far out weigh the aroma. This is liquid hops. Citric and grassy hops are highlighted in ways that I've only seen otherwise in fresh hop beers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Lots of pine, fresh herbal earthiness. Hints of candy sweet malt lay in the background. The best smelling DIIPA I've ever smelled.  T - Assertive hops rush the palate. Fresh pine needles, grapefruit rind, lemon pith, fresh cut grass, fresh cut mint leaves. Caramel malt bleeds through the bouquet of hops. Aftertaste is mouth coating grapefruit.  M - Moderate carbonation, medium bodied that finishes crisp and dry.  This is a citrus hopfest. Although it's not as harsh or bitter than I thought it would be. It's actually very tasty.

White thick foam across the top of the beer with lots of lacing (strands and walls of it) all over the place. Truly a nice beer to look at.  Smell: Of course very hoppy. Lots of grapefruit citrus, some pine-like smells, maybe some mango, and a hint of bergamot.  Taste: I can't say that this ruined my taste buds, but this is definitely a hop-forward beer as advertised. Strong pine/bergamot/grapefruit up front, mellowed out with some malt sweetness, then a sharp bitter finish with a lingering sour lemon bitter finish. It's quite the hop wallop, but it's well done.  Mouthfeel: Just enough carbonation on the tongue, maybe a bit oily as it leaves a sensation all over my teeth (probably all that hop oil). Still nice.  Drinkability: Definitely one for sipping, but I could not have more than one a night. It does after awhile leave me tasting nothing but hops (as forewarned) so I think some care would be needed in pairing this with a meal. Still - a pleasant experience and worth revisiting again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Poured with a huge head that left a nice bit of lacing. This one is all about the hops, hops, and bitter hops. I really wish there was more of a malty backbone to this beer, it's not very well rounded. It's intense hops without much more going on here. I found it exteremely bitter and I prefer IPAs with more going on or a sweet hop character - I've become a bit of a hophead but don't go for a flatly bitter taste in my hops. This one had kind of a one dimensional hop quality of bitter. This may have something to do with an older sample but I found it to be good but uninspiring. I've had some really good IPAs in the last week Surly Wet, Mpls Town Hall Fresh Hop, Ballast Point Sculpin, Alpine Pure Hoppiness. This one was good but I didn't think it lived up to the hype or to those. I'd like to try this fresher to see if it was just that bottle.

I bought this beer based on a magazine review., Being a hophead i was hoping this was a decent beer but not that exceptional because it's a bit pricey. But after taking my first sip it was simply the best beer i have ever had. It's to hoppy for most of my friends so it does not even make it the beer fridge. It's only for me.

Poured a 2 finger head (I poured it that way) which was a pearl white color. Head retention was decent and left a slight lace as it was drank.  (S) Huge aroma on this one. Huge smell of earthy and citrus hops. I have never had a brew that had a smell that was this powerfull and amazing.  (T) Lets just say this one lives up to its name. powerfull flavor that is not for the weak at heart. Hops, Hops, Hops! I suggest being a Hophead before having this one.  (M) The weakest part of this beer and it is still great! A light to mild mouthfeel. I was hoping for a little lighter but is still awesome.  (D) Very drinkable!

S: citrus grspefruit and sweetness from the malts pop out first alongside floral hops and slight grassy notes.  T: The pine notes and hops were alot more potent on the taste than the nose with citrus grspefruit that helped out to push the bitterness on the palate but it did have a good slight caramel sweet presence from the malts to help on the balance.  M: the brew was medium body with a fair amount of carbonation which had a slight sweet, citric, piney, but bitter crisp finish.  D: it drank very good and was a decent interpretation of a west coast style IPA.

147,4083,Phelps,3.9,"Appearance: mostly clear dull copper with a fluffy one-finger head of orangish-tan that collapses slowly, becoming a filmy, lingering top layer with extra heft in the ring. Random spatters of lace dot the glass as I drink.  Smell: pine, grapefruit, lemon, lime. Like the peels of all the best citrus fruits, squirted right into your face. In the background, the sweetness of honey and a tiny bit of caramel and pale malt.  Taste: heavily, heavily bitter. Grapefruit peel, pine needles, saltine crackers, lime juice, mint and a lingering pinecone-like flavor. The sweetness drops of completely, replaced by tongue-encompassing acridity. I feel like I'm mainlining IBUs.  Feel: a high, peppery carbonation assaults the tongue amidst the bitterness. Mildly fizzy, the beer expands a bit as it moves about the mouth. Medium-light in body.  Drink: a tasty IPA, but its drinkability is detracted by the sheer punishing quality of its hoppiness. I think about Ruination the way I think about a double-shot of vodka: I'm drinking this for a purpose, and it sure as hell isn't for the nuance.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Melchizedek,4.53,"Pours ever-so-slightly cloudy gold-bronze with a tight, bubbly, off-white foam that clings desperately to the sides of the glass.  Let's be honest. You bought this for the hops, and that's what you get in the nose. There might be some barley buried deep within, but what you smell is hop, pure and simple, in all its rich, bold, resiny, citrusy, floral goodness. There aren't any adjectives that haven't been used - it's just straight hop aroma and no apologies.  In the mouth, it's pretty medium, with a moderate carbonation that releases more and more hop onto the palate. There's a mineral bite in the back adding to the nose, as well as a wash of heavily hop-seasoned barley bread. Alcohol is surprisingly restrained, and the bitterness is pretty friendly for a brew with this IBU level. The finish is leafy and pleasant, inviting another sip.  You wouldn't want to drink a lot of these in a row, but you might be tempted if you're feeling in the mood for a nice cool carbonated spiked hop tea.

Surprisingly enjoyable.  M: Quite thin and with lower than expected carbonation. This puts the focus more on the awesome hop flavors and makes it more enjoyable overall.  D: Not the most drinkable beer, but far better than expected after reading the bottle. The light body and interesting complexity helps a lot.

Thick and viscous. Barely able to sustain a single-finger head. Good, beefy lacing.  S: Hops well present. Powerful and dry with hints of malt. Smells like it'll be nicely balanced.  T: Well-balanced for an IPA. The finish in the middle of the tongue leaves a wonderful dry, and slightly sweet, malt flavor. Truly thoughtful mixture for a double.

I'd tried Levitation, Vertical Epic, and the ever popular Arrogant Bastard (and Double Bastard) and just haven't gotten what the fuss was about. None of those beers were particularly bad, but they didn't strike me as being as good as I could have got for the price. However, after putting down a six pack of Ruination this week I'm a believer. Hell, I'm even convinced now that some of the other Stone beers I had could have been past their prime or infected in some way. Ruination is an excellent example of a west coast style IPA every step of the way. It pours an orange amber with ample foamy head. Smells of evergreen, bitter hops and citrus. Feels great in your mouth, complimentary carbonation, and well masked alcohol. I also highly appreciate the fact that you can get a six pack of ruination fairly readily.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,bohemiandonut,5,"This one damn proud IPA. Where other beers would hide their hops behind sweet malt, Ruination merely doubles up on them. Consider this review an homage to the only IPA to truly get it right.  Nothing subtle going on here. My glass looks and smells like concentrated hop jizz just exploded all over it. I cannot honestly compare this to any sort of wimpy citrus or pine collaboration, it is an aroma all its own, a deep dank tangy bitterness running circles around every other IPA I've ever had.  Like I noted in the scent, there is something truly subterranean about this brew. Maybe I am drinking the product of some inhuman quasi-natural disaster? Perhaps the enlivened root system of an evil pine tree has taken hold of a grapefruit tree buried somewhere deep beneath a Chilean coal mine before it explodes and vaporizes all organic compounds in proximity? If it has, this is the acid rain of that explosion, and it tastes so good!  You know how when you go back in for that last little follow up sip of a beer and it's missing the *pow* that a deeper slug would give you? Yeah, this beer doesn't either. Every little drop is dripping with flavor, tongue-curling flavor.  So easily my favorite DIPA it's not even funny. This hop monster makes Pliny look like it hasn't even earned an I much less a D.

147,4083,StarshipPoopers,4.3,"A - This beer looks great. It practically glows orange in the light and is very hazy. About a finger of white foamy head forms when pouring, settles down to a nice film that coats the glass with good lacing.  S - Very hoppy, definitely getting strong pine resin smells with small hints of citrus and floral notes, primarily grapefruit. The hops are pretty strong, they smell fantastic.  T - More subdued than I thought, which I found surprising based on the strength of the hops in the smell. The best before date on the bottle is 07/08/10 which I didn't notice before, that is too bad since I suspect it has something to do with the diminished hoppiness.  That being said, the hops are still notable and blend nicely with the notes of grapefruit. The ABV is hidden very well, I don't taste a hint of alcohol despite it being a 7.7%.  M - The mouthfeel on this beer is great, I think that they got the carbonation just right. It has a medium body that is very smooth and feels excellent.  D - Very drinkable. The smoothness and lack of harsh tones means that I would gladly have many of these. That being said, I do believe that as I mentioned earlier my hops probably suffered as a result of being two months past the best before date.  I know that this drink deserves a higher taste rating, but until I get a fresher bottle I have to go with what I tasted, which was a great smooth beer with good tasting hops that tasted a little dated and diminished. I will gladly drink my 3 of these and update my rating later when I find a fresher bottle. Otherwise, solid 4.5's all around.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Although not as balanced as I would have liked. Some grapefruit and tangerines at the start, but by and large dominated by the bitterness at the finish. I don't bind a nice crisp bitter finish for a beer of this style, but this one was out of proportion and a bit overwhelming in my opinion.  M: Pretty good, though it could use a little less carbonation. Sits on the tongue well.  D: I probably won't have this again.

Some malt flavor is there but is difficult to note the style as the hops are powerful and demand your full attention when tasting.  M- Medium body and very smooth, not crisp by any means but i would also not consider this to be very ""sticky"" carbonation is in more of the middle range and works well with the beer.  D- Great beer, more drinkable than it should be, have to make myself not drink it too fast.

147,4083,eclaycamp,4.82,"Promising a full out assault on the palate, Stone's Ruination isn't short in the hype department. I was pleased to find this on the shelf (or, more accurately, in the cooler) as part of my haul from Denver. Stone is rapidly developing into my favorite beer on the planet, which kind of sucks as I'm stuck in land locked Kansas and a steady supply of stone just isn't readily available here.  The 22 ounce bottle has some great artwork and a wonderful description on the back. I really like the fact that Stone paints their bottles. I also like the gargoyle motif. I'm doing this one right, pouring it into my snifter. The beer pours a bright amber, like freshly changed fall leaves, with a big bubbly head that slowly dissipates. Pretty decent amount of lacing considering the ABV involved in this beer.  Aroma is wonderful, with a hefty amount of pine and resin. Holy cow. If I was rating this on smell alone it would probably be in the top 5, maybe top 3, of IPAs that I've smelled before.  The first sip gives you an idea of what kind of bitterness you're dealing with, with a searing bitterness that, yes, ruins your tongue. Mouthfeel is sturdy and well constructed, with just enough carbonation to do the trick. It's very sticky, though not syrupy. Again, well done. This is one of the hoppiest beers that I've had in my life, yet it's never overwhelming thanks to the fabulous malt profile. There's an incredible sweetness that comes out as your palate adjusts. It's a neat trick. It's sweet, but not too much so. Kind of tastes like glazed donuts chased by dank pine.  Trying to catalog the hop profile itself is kind of a fool's errand. Aside from the aforementioned pine, there's this thick grass note that comes to the forefront the more you drink it. Surprisingly, the hops aren't as scratchy as I expected them to be, though the dry hopping really takes the beer over the top. I also really like the lingering finish to this beer.  Overall Ruination lives up to it's namesake, and the only complaint I have is that it's not readily available to me here in Kansas. Very solid example of the double IPA style, and yet another in a long line of incredible Stone beers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,bobhits,4.92,"Forget the normal reviews. How does stone do this? I love hops but there's something about that grape fruit flavor that often doesn't work for me. No issue here. This is just a master piece. I used to like the bigger malt finishes from say a 90 minute, but this is just perfect.  Thin enough for the bubbles to be seen and oh is this well carbonated. A nice white head that lasts and pours huge. More than enough lacing if that's your thing. Not oily which might make some enjoy the lacing a bit more.  The nose is a blitz of hops. Citirus, grape fruit and just amazing  The taste is just more of the same. I can tell there is some malt in here but hell if I can tell you anything about it. This is hop forward. I recall talking to Greg once at Pazzos in Lexington and he mentioned how this was one of the first double IPAs and how others have gotten bigger with theirs. Yeah this could be just an IPA by some brewers standards (heck it comes off less heavy than stone ipa imo). I think of 90 minute as the standard for double IPAs...this just blows it out of the water.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Chizoad,4.32,"Ruination. Don't drink this if you're not ready for massive hops. It says so on the back label! Of course this is true most west coast Imperial IPAs.  Hazy, then clearing amber pour with a great head and retention and fine lacing.  An excellent nose full of grapefruit, a little pine, and a little bit of something I just could not identify. Certainly nothing I'd ever smelled in a beer. The smell promised great things.  The taste delivered. Amazing hops and a wide variety of bitter flavors to boot. Of course grapefruit, tangerine, and pine, but then that strong bitterness that is common to many Stone beers. The great thing is this one never becomes too bitter and it never escalates with each sip. As the beer warmed a little malt shone through. Almost like a joke to say ""sure we could have balanced it but why bother?""  Good mouthfeel, but I felt a little low on the carbonation. Maybe they got it right though, because if the carbonation were a little stronger the bitter flavors might not be as supple.  Quite drinkable and refreshing. One bomber is enough for me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,sogrady,4.5,"Absolutely overwhelming DIPA which, as promised, will destroy your palate. Hops are so aggressive as to be borderline mean, and yet the beer is highly drinkable. Far more so than some of the absurdly hopped concoctions being pumped out of less adept breweries these days.  If you like IPAs/DIPAs, you have to try this. If you're not a hops fan, meanwhile, this is one to steer clear of.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Perfectly balanced, complex hops of pine and citrus with an earthy backbone matched up with just the right amount of sweetness to bring it full circle. The mouthfeel is exceptional with a smooth buttery character which is rich but not too thick. Looks good with a nice sheet of thin lacing down the entire glass.

147,4083,JAXSON,4.1,"Clear caramel pour with a medium, pillowy white head. Typical IIPA aroma, big hops, some pine. Flavor initially gave two immediate impressions: 1) the palate was slightly heavy, as if the malt was just slightly overpowering the hops, and 2) a faint but noticeable presence of fruit that is not typical of this style, along the lines of mango or passion fruit. The tropical fruit impression is very nice. I wish the bitterness was a bit lower so those fruits could shine more. Thanks to my brother-in-law Chris.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,chumba526,4.32,"Appears light orange color with a thin layer of white foam. It smells of citrusy, grassy hops. There is an ever so slight malt sweetness present in the smell as well.  The taste: hops, hops, and hops. A strong citrus grassy hop bite first shows up, the citrus flavor adds to an excellent palate wreaking bitterness. A nice mild caramel malt flavor helps balance the beer slightly. The bitterness remains on the palate for a while. Hoppy bitterness defines the taste.  Carbonation is moderate, I would say about medium.  Drinkability is quite nice. It is quite light and smooth for being so bitter.  Overall this is one of the beers that got me into craft beer. This is a new classic Imperial IPA. It might not be as complex as some IIPAs but it sure is tasty. If you haven't had this beer: buy it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S: Flowery hops, citrus notes, and a slight bit of malt.  T: Very complex. Lots of hops obviously, with some lemon and orange flavors, also alchol and some malt presence. Bitter, but pleasant; it numbs the mouth in a good way.  M: Smooth and perfectly carbonated.  D: Goes down easily enough but shreds the palette (as advertised), so any beers after this one would taste almost bland.  Overall a fabulously complex and balanced IPA.

Fluffy head, 2 finger-breadths, nice lacing. Scents of herbs, citrus and flowers persist in the nose. Starts with a good punch of malt flavor. Citrus and woody flavors begin to appear with warming alcohol throughout. While 100 IBU's made me think this would be a bitter offering from Stone, it was actually well balanced and had just the right amount of hops. Feels substantial in the mouth, you know you are drinking a worthy beer. Easily one of the most drinkable IPA's out there, and by far one of the most enjoyable.

147,4083,tewaris,5,"Stone Ruination IPA Stone Brewing Co. Imperial IPA 7.7% ABV OG? 100+ IBUs 12 oz bottle with an ""enjoy by"" date of October 19, 2010 poured into a New Belgium snifter  Appearance 5/5 Very clear orange-red; amber when backlit with white light. Big, off-white, persistent head and insanely fantastic lacing.  Aroma 5/5 Very fresh and herbal, intense, hop aroma. Piney and grassy. I can smell it without sticking my nose in it.  Taste 5/5 Starts bitter, finishes bitter; or as BJCP says, absurdly bitter. There's a decent malt backbone, but I must say that it's just a backbone: no sweetness can be perceived when the beer is cold and it's tough to let it warm (see Drinkability). But for the sake of review, I let another bottle warm up, and the hop flavor, combined with the malts renders a fruity character before the finish. But this beer is not about malt character at all. It's all it claims to be! A dry and bittering finish, with notable warming; not just mouth (tongue, teeth, even lips), even my throat is bitter. The best kind of bitter, that could have gotten annoying, which brings us to the next item.  Mouthfeel 5/5 Hard to say whether it's an IPA or a DIPA, on the basis of mouthfeel alone but this won't deter me from giving this one the best score. The body is spot on, less than this could have made this an annoying experiment. Well carbonated and crisp, but not harsh.  Drinkability 5/5 Supreme. Nobody can have just one* *Talking about those who can have one in the first place.  Other Indeed a liquid poem to the glory of the hop.

Body is clear, light honey-amber with a half-finger whitish head, which settles quickly to film. Leaves no real lace.  S: Nice. Hops. Citrus, pine and tropical fruits. Slight note of wet cardboard, comes across as metallic or minerally at times.  T: Follows the nose. Sweetish malt foundation (honey-like a bit), followed by lemony citrus, and slightly grassy pine hops. Maybe a touch of mint toothpaste. Lingering lemon in the aftertaste.  M: Smooth, slightly oily/slick, which cuts a bit of bitter hop ""bite."" Doesn't feel - or appear to be - highly carbonated.  D: Very good.

Intense. Glorious. The color is typical amber-orange with a nice head retention and lacing. Taste is not as insane as one would expect---hops up the wazoo, yes---but very drinkable. Real juicy and bitter up front, but smooth---then finishes dry. Really an amazing beer. And at $4.50-5 a bomber locally, a steal.

T - thankfully, the nose provides a very good preview of what's to come from this brew. Loads of sweet and citrusy hops dominate the palate; however there is quite a bit of buttery caramel malt to balance out the 100+ IBU onslaught. It leaves with a bitter finish. This reminds me a lot of hopslam.  M - buttery, slick mouthfeel with a body in between medium and full that goes down smoothly.  D - wow. This is a solid IPA.

Can smell a slight sweet doughy malt scent deep in the background.  They call this beer Ruination for a reason. It ruins your palate. Any beer you consume after this beer, its taste is void. Hops, hops, hops.. and a little more hops. Nice citrus and very bitter hop taste immediately. It's one of those palate cripplingly bitter beers. The punishment is oh so good. Pine and citrus hops are having a little battle over who you taste more. There is a slight bready flavor in the background too.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and dry.

Not a lot of balance with very little malt back but wow does this taste good. In my opinion this is the best all out hop brew I have had. I pick these up on occasion just to realign my love for big hops.  M: Clean crisp carbonation perfect for the style.  D: If you want a pure hoppy IIPA, this is where you should be looking.

147,4083,droomyster,4.35,"Being something like the 2,149th person to review this masterpiece, there's almost certainly nothing new I can say, but I'll give it a shot if only for my own records.  Pours a slightly cloudy amber with a generously apportioned, sticky, frumpy, craggy, mess of a white head. Aromas practically run the gamut of hop adjectives (minus ""earthy"" and ""woody""), but are primarily citrusy, then piney and resinous, with floral notes to boot. I also detect a bit of caramel on the nose and a faint hint of alcohol, which is hardly surprising considering the abv. Taste-wise, the hops truly do perform an absolute palate-wipe. Unless you are eating something sweet and sticky ( like bbq ribs) or strong and greasy (like garlic fries), I wouldn't recommend this for a suitable pairing, but if such dishes are the case, you need search no further than this beer to find a match made in heaven.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Very dry smell with very little malt undertone. The taste is similar to the smell, very dry, piney, hoppy and some citrus note. There's some basic caramel like quality to the malt but it's mostly the hop dry kick. Very bitter on the end and very dry. It's mouthfeel could be thicker in comparison to other IPAs in this ABV field. It's not very drinkable because of the intense hop dryness but that's what most people order this beer for.

T: This beer certainly has some phases to it, at first you get hit with some floral components. Then you get the hops/bitterness followed by the bready malts that even everything out.

The smell just intoxicates you as the brew warms. Simply amazing.  T- hops, hops, and some more hops. Grapefruit dominates but there's some pine apple and tangerine in there too. Some pine and a grassy herbal veg touch, but to a lesser extent. Malts are there but never steal the show. Brings to mind toasted wheat bread and some light brown sugar. Long semi astringent finish.  M- a step or two about medium in body and even one more step in carb that tingles the tongue aggressively.  D- this one is all about the hops and doesn't leave you short.

The beer was a tawny amber with a centimeter of foam floating on top of the ale. The beer is fiercely bitter with a lot of West Coast hop flavors, especially putteringly bitter and acidic Cascade hops. The mouthfeel was oily and thick from the hop resins.

Fairly high carbonation and a full-bodied mouthfeel. Burst of cane sugar and grapefruit up front, some passing toasty malts, and a long, dry, tart finish of hoppy citrus, pepper, and pine.

S - Tons of grapefruit sweetness balanced well with some nice delicious pale malt. The citrus is mostly present though with a slight flowery bouquet. Nice sweetness is present on the back end.  T - Strong orange and grapefruit sweetness comes up first quickly followed by the strong citrus burst. The citrus is not as overwhelming as expected because it is well balanced by some nice sweet and bready pale malt that comes in and out. There is some slight spice and vanilla that is present in this beer way on the back end. This beer is bitter and dry as it finishes very delicious and indicative of a DIPA.

Behind the initial whiff of floral, citrus bitterness, was a wall of strong malt backbone which held the hoppiness in check. Clearly they were going for a style which would blow your socks off and they sure succeeded. If I had any criticism it is that it lacked a bit of complexity in the hoppiness...the strongest hops seemed to drown out the more floral elements a tad, sort of like an orchestra where the brass overshadows the woodwinds. For a comparable style with more complexity, at least in this man's opinion, try the Green Flash West Coast IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,dogfishandi,4.43,"12 oz bottle of fridge poured into a pint glass. best before 7-8-2010, so a little over a month overdue, but i dont think it will hurt the 100+ ibu.  pours a hazy golden, orange, a little yellow when held up to the light. a nice 2 fingers head that was pretty retentive, left a nice 1/4 inch of creamy white foam. some nice lace.  i smelled them perfumey hops as soon as i cracked the cap. resinous perfumey hops dominate, some earthy, floral, and citrus notes. a nice caramel/ toasted grain malt backing. not bad, but ive smelled hoppier.  the taste is great. has a nice balance, but its a little more hoppy than malty. resinous perfumy hops, tropical fruits, grapefruit citrus, a little pine and maybe a little floral at times. a nice toasted grain/ caramel malt back. leaves a great lingering bitterness with undescribably great lingering flavors. kind of like a tasty mix of malts and hops that just come together to leave this great taste in your mouth that just dominates your palate. the finish is my favorite. almost worthy of a 5.  a great mouthfeel, perfect carbonation. medium to heavy feeling body. oily resinous hops just wreck your palate after each sip, i love it!  dangerous drinkability, the alcohol doesnt get in your way at all. i could sip this all night, i just wish i had more than this one 12 oz bottle.  ive had this before and ill definatly have it again. i would really like to try this fresher next time, but as is, it still tasted amazing. the aroma didnt really live up to my expectations, but the taste exceeded them by far. highly recommended DIPA in my book!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,uhhhaaron,4.42,"consumed 07-08-2010, 22oz bomber into pint glass.  appearance: pours a nice cloudy/hazy orange color with a clean, frothy 1.5 finger head.  smell: tropical fruits right off the bat. The big three are mango, pineapple & orange.. A citrus delight. Tropical/fruity goodness :) you also get a wave of that Stone pine aroma & grapefruit. But for the most part the fruits dominate. Almost no booze smell detection. A pleasant smelling brew.  taste: sweetness upfront. Again you get hit with the same tropical fruits as the nose. Then a GIANT rush of hop bitterness takes over. Oily resin, lots of pine, lots of grapefruit/hoppyness compose the finish. Just what you expect from a Stone double IPA.  mouthfeel: a bit creamy with a medium body. Finishes pretty crisp with a nice hoppy taste lingering on the palate.  drinkability: for a Stone double IPA, very easy to put down. couldn't put the glass down. Solid!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,foogerd,4.18,"A-a hazy deep orange with a tan foamy head with plenty of lacing S- i smelled the fresh hops a foot away from the beer while pouring no question about it thats what dominates the nose , i do get a malt sweetness after taking a few more sniffs T- wow! now this is what a dipa should taste like ! the hops are perfectly integrated with a malt backdrop, i get grapefruit citrus notes and lots of bitterness from the hops, the malt background quells the bitterness without compromising the IPAness of the beer. M- oily, carbonation tickles the tongue just right D- wheres the 7.7 on this ?! i cant find it an amazing brew a great example of a pimped ipa",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,HanTran,3.81,"An over-rated ImpIPA. Weak in the nose with the standard qualities there but only barely. Looks nice, laces well,but a bit pale in color. Flavor is predominately unmasked alcohol with a bit of over-ripe fruit and a lot of grapefruit, not complex. Finish is all bitter and sour.  A good ImpIPA but not great as its rating would indicate, guess its been well marketed though.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,deadliest,4.38,"Appearance: Like all Stone products, a model of what it's style should look like. How do they do that so consistently? Amber golden with 1.5 finger of persistent eggshell head. Just about perfect.  Smell: Citrusy hops and pine needles dominate the nose. If there's malts in there at all they've been bullied into not coming out to play.  Taste: Supposedly there's malts that come along in the back end, but I don't find them at all. I'm too busy appreciating the hops that are a fine blend of 'purposely' bitter and smooth citrus flavors.  Feel: Excellent feel for what it is. All the flavor, and at that % ABV while still retaining a crisp, carbonated mouthfeel. Rivals the appearance in perfection.  Drink: Very good. I could drink a few of these, but I have to admit my palate would be wrecked if I had more than two. I don't even know if that's a fault or not, since this beers charm is in how extreme it is.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mash4077,4.23,"12oz to glass  A- Pale yellow, a bit cloudy, with half a finger of white head with good retention.  S- Powerful citrus hops. Love the hop smell but it's not very varied or complex.  T- Wow, it truly lives up to its reputation. Intense hops flavor from start to finish, mostly citrus in character. Malts are subtle but definitely there, with a sweet and mellow ice-cream taste. Floral hops come out a little more as it warms, adding a new dimmension to the taste. This is not one to gulp down right out of the fridge. Very nice.  M- Great body, great carbonation, a creamy feel on the toungue with some light fizz.  D- Not that great, but I guess a little better than I expected for the hop profile. All in all a truly great beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jal30,3.35,"This is one of those beers that for me was just overhyped, and I never came around on it. Really nice amber appearance with very little head. I consider myself a big hophead, but this is one of the few big IPAs that I find really undrinkable. There is a really nice piney hop aroma and boy is the taste just a magnification of that smell. I just find Ruination to be too uncomplicated in its bitterness--an overload on hops as I often enjoy, but just in an unpleasant manner. Certainly a solid beer, but not one I will continue to seek out. I have had it four or five times now, including on tap, and it just doesn't do it for me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,KSac4115,4.67,"Pours a pale, golden orange with about a one finger, white head.  Strong floral scent with hints of pine. Some fruity smells and a mild citrus smell. Smells very sweet and almost sappy like.  Taste is citrusy and hoppy. Very well blended flavors. A fairly good hoppy, bitter bite to it but nothing overpowering. Again, very well blended flavors. A mild grapefruit taste mixed with other sweet tastes to start finishing off bitter.  Mouthfeel is surprisingly smooth for its alcohol percentage. Medium carbonation.  Overall this is a very drinkable beer despite its high alcohol content and hopiness. Extremely solid Imperial IPA. Very pricey but I really can't get enough. Will definitely be going back for more. Highly recommend for IPA lovers.  Cheers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,PicoPapa,4.1,"22oz bomber with lots of words on it. Hazy yellowish orange with some head and great lacing the entire duration of the beer. Smells of citrus hops and pine. Taste is damn good. Lots of hops taste with pine and citrus as well. A solid bitter beer and a great beer. Has that classic ""Stone"" taste to it, just with more hops. Enjoy this hoppy concoction, but don't waste any of your good beers for afterwards.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,punkrkr27,4,"Golden copper pour with a dense white head. Wet grape-fruity hops coming out int the aroma balanced by honey sweet malts, and some leafy/grassiness.

147,4083,Spica66,4.6,"22 oz into pint glass.  A: Deep amber/orange color. Decent head formation with minimal retention.  S: Citrus and pine hops are the only smell coming out of this glass!  T: Hops with hops and a sprinkling of hops.  M: Take note all other brewers of the world: You don't have to have sticky or syrup mouthfeel in your DIPA!!  D: With the the great taste and smell, light mouthfeel and reasonable ABV, I don't see how a DIPA could get any more drinkable than this one!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,drinkiusmaximus,4.53,"A-pours a nice deep golden color with a two fingers width head which dissipates but never disappears. I wouldnt call it lacing as much as i would a coating,nice sticky lacing everywhere!!  S-Nice floral/citrousy hop aroma touched slighty by malts.  T-Hop bitterness dominates but is mellowed by a nice touch of malts on the back end.  M-medium bodied and the bitterness lingers but I welcome that with open arms. Very nice to see/taste/feel and smell 100+ IBU's in a single IPA. wonderful.  D-Although i may prefer more citrous/grapefruit in the taste of my hops This is one Brew that certainly stands alone and makes one never lament for a second having opened it!  Prost!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Schmaltzy,4.12,"A- Nice hazy golden color with orange hues and 1 finger head that leaves light lacing.  S- Hops, Hops, Hops. Nice citrus and pine hops front and center with a slight sweet maltiness on the backend, definate west coast Imperial IPA.  T- Nice light caramel malt with the 100+IBU's kicking in quickly to add tons of hops and bitterness. Loads of pine and light citrus hops dominate the taste buds.  M- Good medium body with ample carbonation that cleanses the tounge and with 100 IBU's it is definately a West Coast IPA....  D- I finished a six pack within several hours with no hesitations, but I am a HOPHEAD and at less than 8% this is definately drinkable for those who love hops.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,IronCitySteve,4.37,"A; Pours a hazy straw color, with a slight twinge of orange. Provides a small white head that ends up as a small film. Very spotty lacing.  S: A nice aroma of hops hit the palate right away. There is a small amount of bready malt in there. Very nice aroma.  T: Hops hops and more hops. Lots and lots of pine hops, with just a tad, of bready malt.  M: Leaves a bitter taste on the palate. The beer boasts about 100+ IBUs and it certainly does taste that way.  D: For me, I can drink multiple in a sitting despite the higher ABV. One of my favorites.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,lou50rp,4.1,Deep amber color with a white head. Little carbonation. Smell was a mild grapefruit aroma with hops in the background. Taste is citrus with a hop finish and a touch of alcohol at the end. The mouth fell was of a medium body. Definitely drinkable. Another good brew from Stone.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,originalsin,4.42,"Popped the top off this growler, eagerly anticipating that loud, intense ""pop"" but it seemed far more toned down than usual. The pour yielded a fat pillowy head nonetheless. Smell is heavily of grapefruit - it's very very hoppy. This brew smells like a double ipa, I can't help but think that. A lot of hoppy goodness on the nose... Taste follows suit - there's a big hop presence here, and a good deal of it presents itself as the mildly bitter taste of grapefruit. There's also a strong malty backbone to this beer though. The beer is medium bodied but still it's an easy drinking beer. Always has been a favorite of mine. I wish I'd opened this growler a bit sooner (waited a good month....) but still, it's perfect. I love Stone, and I love Ruination.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,bucklemyshoe,4.45,"22 oz. bottle into Stone I.R.S. tulip. Pours golden-orange with two fingers of fluffy head. The aroma is a very pleasant blend of orange, apricot, lemon, a bit of pine and piles of hops. The taste is dominated by the citrus flavors with a bitter hoppy finish. The 100+ IBUs stay at bay for much of the experience, and the mouthfeel is oily and memorable. It doesn't get much better than this.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,steelerguy,4.32,"A - Hazy gold, short white head, low carbonation.  S - Earthy and floral hop aroma that accentuates the sweetness from the malt that comes through.  T - Hop blast, but it is the immense hop flavors that hit you first. Lots of citrus, with some grapefruit sweet and bitter flavors. A nice pungent flavor to counter the citrus. Finishes with a bitterness level that is high but countered nicely with warming effects of the alcohol.  M - Light to medium body even for a bit beer, would appreciate a touch more carbonation to help clean up the palate after a sip (would also help keep the meager head around longer).  D - Extremely bold with tons of flavor, but manages to pull it off by countering the extreme bitterness with tons of flavor, aroma, and alcohol.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,CONOR8832,4.44,"A - Amber with a touch of honey, a little cloudy, overall make a good looking pour, nice froathy head, good lacing as you drink.  S - Exceptional smell, earthy, citrusy, very hoppy, touch of pine.  T - Good stong bitterness, explosion of hoppy flavor with an added milded sweetness after it sits in your mouth. Once you swallow it leaves your mouth craving and urging you to take another sip.  M - Not to heavy, not too light, very medium bodied, leaves a unique coating on the mouth that entices you to drink more.  D - Definatley one of my favorites, very easy to drink a couple of these a day if I could. Highly recomend for any hophead, Stone hits a home run with this one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,ridglens,4.32,"poured into a portsmouth snifter, poured a thick, dark orange. hazy beer. a thin island of head sticks around, a little lacing on the glass. smells first of great fresh hoppy goodness, like fresh greapfruit. there is also a definite woody malt profile, though it'n definitely not center stage. taste is of course bitter, with a touch of malty goodness that smooths it out. just a great beer, tastes truly amazing. the mouthfeel is a good level of thickness, but i guess the one thing this beer is not made for was long sessions. the hops are good, but the lasting bitter gets just a little harsh/tiring at the end of the glass. not a bad thing, just a thing!  great beverage, had it along side a sculpin and a PTE, and place this ahead of the sculpin.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,thatsfine,4.02,"Served on-tap into a pint glass.  This is a dark, cloudy gold color. A thick one finger head that stays for most of the glass but is just about gone by the last sip. Nice rings of lacing the whole way down.  Definitely hoppy. That goes without saying. But I am picking up a little more sweetness and a tiny bit of smoke. Very cool.  A pretty large amount of hops right away, but the malts are well-balanced so it's not brutal. The tiny bit of sweetness balances the hops nicely. The back end is a little smoky and has a nice bitter aftertaste. Very delicious.  The way it felt was nothing spectacular. What it should feel like. Medium bodied and moderate carbonation. Creamy feeling.  One pint was perfect. I would finish a bomber, but that much of this beer might be a little much. But refreshing for the style. Another awesome beer by Stone. They have never let me down.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,GottBier,4.48,"Appearance: Honey and smoky - a beautiful sight. A lovely, rich, long-lasting head. It gives you a sense of security - ""this beer's for real""  Smell: Complex - banana, rye bread, and indefinable aromas.  Taste: Almost too much going on. Everything from citrus to banana, followed by a sharp, hoppy bitterness. After that, an almost woody depth of flavor.  Mouthfeel - Smooth and thick. Like liquid velvet.  Drinkability - One bottle is just right. How many times do you want to listen to a very intense, complex Chopin Etude? This will take some getting used to for this beer advocate. There's a sort of hybrid confusion going on, a battle between a smooth, thick mouthfeel and a malty sensation on the one hand, and a bitter IPA hoppy citrusy punch on the other. Leaves you wondering. A postmodern beer?",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ithacabaron,4.12,"Pours a very appetizing shade of peach. Honey highlights and a foamy, pockmarked head finish out the appearance. Would like to see a bit more staying power from the head.  Aroma is a pure blast of fresh mango, with that fruit's distinct juicy/pine combination in full force. A whisper of guava, and just a touch of fermented, cool alcohol fill out the nose. Remarkably fresh.  Taste presents a full range of flavors, starting sweet with notes of ripe pineapple and orange zest, flavors soon cut off by a bitter lash of resinous, tar-like hops. On the swallow, the true depth of this beer's bitterness rises to the surface, manifesting itself in a slightly burnt, acrid dryness that lingers on the tongue. Like an uneventful flight that ends in an emergency landing, this beer presents every dimension of the hop, for better and for worse.  Mouthfeel is just right, with lively carbonation that never gets too aggressive.  Drinkability is decent; a dedicated drinker could put away an entire bomber, but this 12 oz. bottle is fine for me. Even with such a strong alcohol content, this beer remains light on its feet.  All in all, a great brew -- a pure, uncut, blissful rush for the dedicated hop head. Consider it welcome in my fridge anytime.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,californiakulak,3.95,Poured a 22oz bottle into my Augustiner liter glass.  A. This beer is lighter than I remember. Dark golden color. Huge fluffy head that lingers for a long time.  S. Thick overpowering hop aroma. Strong pine and citrus notes.  T. Good beer. Overwhelming hop flavor. Citrus again with some malt flavors.  M. Very bitter. Almost painful in fact. Medium body with good carbonation. The only thing that stands out though is the intense bitterness.  D. Not very drinkable. I can enjoy one than I am through.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,JunkYardJake,4.12,"On-tap at Bulls Head Pub in Lititz. Big ol'fluffy head on top of a red-orange sunburst color brew. Lacing and retention is excellent. Smell is a beautiful assault on the nostrils. Floral and perfumy aroma hops are abundant. First sip reveals an intense floral and earthy hop flavour. Warm alcohol and a very dry and bitter finish follow. There is alot to take in. Pretty drinkable considering the crowded palate and the level of bitterness. Although I prefer Stone's IPA, this is certainly a worthy brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Mancer,4.02,"This beer poured a gold color with a two finger high off-white head. The head slowly dissipated throught out the life of the beer. Thick lacing coated the glass. The initial smell of the beer was citrus hops with light a malt backbone. The initial taste of the beer was the citrus and grapefruit flavor of the hops. This progressed to a slight malty sweetness and finished with a lingering hop character and dryness. The beer had a medium body with medium carbonation.  I've had this beer several times now and can't believe that I never reviewed it. I find that I am repeatedly blown away by the quality of the beers from Stone. This is no exception, Ruination is an excellent example of what an American DIPA should be. When I satiate for a dry kick and tons of citrus, this is the beer that I pick up. I highly recommend this to any IPA or DIPA lover out there.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,OlieIPA,4.03,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Stone Imperial Pint glass.  A: Light copper hued body that supported a massive off-white head and thick coat of viscous lacing.  S: Tons of bitter hop aroma and less floral and estery like characteristics. The malt body comes later in the smell, providing ample amounts of sweetness that help counter act the surplus of hops.  T: A definite palate wrecker, this DIPA immediately coats the back of your tongue unlike any other IPA I've had in recent memory. Good and bad at the same time, the malt has just enough sweetness to balance this beautiful example of a ""West Coast Hop Bomb"".  M: Not overly dry, but it's definitely a signature characteristic of Stone Ruination. The carbonation also helps amplify the hop bitterness...which I vastly enjoy in this case.  D: Even with it's sometimes over-the-top hop bite, this beer is quite drinkable.  Overall: A perfect example of an SD DIPA. A must try. Cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S: Resiny sticky hop notes. Very floral, grassy, and perfumey. Sweet malt and a little bit of bread shine through the hops. T: Follows the nose with floral and piney hops balanced by sweet toasted malt. Finish is full of citrus rind, grapefruit and honey. Bitterness is crisp and lingers in the aftertaste along with some sweet fruity flavors. Slight viscous alcohol feel in the finish as well. M: Very flavorful with a good hop punch that is fairly balanced by the sweet malt. Medium body with even and soft carbonation all the way through. D: Very well rounded. Loads of hop flavor but not as bitter as one would think. What a DIPA should taste like.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,404UGA,4.13,"Very attractive gold color. Hoppy but not excessively so, still flavorful. Extremely drinkable beer for the type. Very smooth. Could have easily had a couple more.

147,4083,FeDUBBELFIST,3.55,"Served in a 9 oz snifter for $5.50.  A: Less than a finger of creamy foamy off-white head with a yellow orange tinge. The body is an apricot orange with very respectable clarity. The head doesn't last long, but the lace begins to lay down nicely as a mix between sheets and holes. The lacing doesn't continue after the head depreciates, I'm left with a thin film and steady collar.  S: The nose is tropical, mostly clementine and peach but not as invested as the stand out examples of the style. Malts are noticeable, white bread and biscuity.  T: Nothing further develops from the nose to the palate. Flavorwise, Ruination epitomizes the perfectly average DIPA.  M: The mouthfeel is pretty impressive as Stone's tend to be. More than adequate carbonation, semi-fizzy and prickling. Bitterness is appropriate. The finish is dry and the flavor resonates for a respectable amount of time.  D: Drinkability is above average but nothing too special in Stone's Ruination. More often than not, I pass on this one. There are simply too many great DIPAs available to make this a real contender.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BigBen61,3.94,"This is the beer that will make any self proclaimed ""hophead"" think twice before opening his trap again! During the earlier parts of my experience with beer I found out quickly that IPA's and Imperial IPA's were some of my favorite beers. That being said, this beer hits a strange spot for me in my beer journey. Almost anyone who has tried this beer will tell you the name is no joke, and after a few sips almost any other beer will taste like carbonated water (well maybe not but you get the idea). It will in fact ""ruin"" your palate (at least for a short amount of time). Onto the review...  The appearance was magnificent holding a good two fingers of pearly white head and with a much deeper golden color than I would have expected. The nose was by far my favorite part of this beer. There was no end to the hop aromas, which ranged from sweet and citrus like to darker wood and pine tar aromas. The nose was also an accurate indicator of the bitterness of this beer and after sip one...OMG! If you don't like your beers much more bitter than than an average pale ale, then stay the hell away. If however you enjoy having an alpha acid onslaught murder your palate look no further. The beer started off with a wonderful complex maltiness, followed by mouth puckering bitterness and citrus hoppiness in the midpalate, and a nearly choking slam of pine tar hoppiness on the finish that could literally last for minute after minute following every sip.  My only qualm with this beer is the drinkability. While I love the bitterness of hops, this one is so over the top that I found my 22 oz. bomber to be broken down into three segments. The first 10 to 12 ounces were as wonderful and exciting as any beer I've ever had. The next few ounces began to wear my palate down, and by the end of the bottle I had to choke down the dregs. That being said it's one of the most intense beer experiences you can find anywhere!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,VelvetExtract,4.47,"A- Surprisingly light in color with a decent head that leaves some nice lacing. Quite hazy. Not the beers strongest point but there are other far more important parts that the appearence.  S-Smells of pine and citus come out to play. I even get some pineapple which is always a treat. This beer is incredibly aromatic. I think this is the smell that made me fall in love with IPA/DIPAs.  T- Bitter as anything I've laid lip to. I love it. Menacingly hoppy. Bitter piney hops take charge. Also get some nice citrusy flavors in there too.  M-Good amount of carbonation. Dry and delicious. The tiny alcohol sting only adds to the awesome tongue beating.  D-Quite drinkable for a 7.7%. Still remains somewhat light which adds to its drinkability. For the power behind this beer, it is unbelievably drinkable.  Maybe the first beer that got me into craft. Have tried it many times since I have started with my beer hobby; still holds up just as good as any other brew. A legend in my mind.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,FeloniousDrunk,4.02,"This brew poured hazy to the point of opaque from a 12 oz. bottle into my beer mug the color of wheat. Minimal head (though the pour was unintentionally smooth) but the effect this beer has in the light of holding a straw-yellow outside with a tan core is quite pretty.  The nose is greatly hoppy, with large floral notes and a touch of citrus. A wee bit of sweet fruit under all of the hops can be detected.  The taste hits you immediately: hops, hops, hopes, with a clean grapefruit flavor on the swallow. This beer's hoppiness can best be described as a fine balance between bitter and floral with a sticky-dry aftertaste.  The mouthfeel is large and expanding, with a nice clean finish that leaves your mouth parched and looking for more.  This beer lives up to its title, as it ""ruins your palate"" upon the first sip. That, to a serious hop-head, is a compliment.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S - All the hops and more that I want from an IPA, nice floral notes, orange, pineapple, and pine.  T - Hops and pine so good, filled with the fruit flavor of juicy pineapple and a bit of orange. The bitter aspect of this beer perfectly accompanies the rest as it all mellows in your mouth waiting for the next sip.  M - Very smooth and creamy, coats the mouth and throat with the smallest alcohol burn that adds another sensation to the beer.  D - This beer is balanced, full of flavor and hops and is oh so good!

Deteriorated quite slowly and decrepit-ly, leaving giant peaks and valleys and craters as it did. Thick pockets of lacing stick to the sides of the glass as it does. More pockets of lacing accumulate as you drink it down.  S: Hops and pine. A little bittersweet chocolate, citrus, and some woodiness.  T: Very hoppy. Nice and bitter. Has a nice thick and full flavor. Piny with just the slightest hint of sweetness.  M: Dry and hoppy.... what else can I say. The hops 'assault' the palette and hang around for the entire experience.  D: Well... the harsh hoppiness of this brew will limit your drinking velocity. Sip and enjoy the hoppy goodness.  Atmosphere is very nice. Great regal appearance, and a full floral nose. Flavor is not complex, but pure in its intent. Overall, this is a really good quaff.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,thetomG,3.62,"Pours mostly clear with a nice frothy head and just a little bit of lacing. Aroma is just straight hops. Flavor is the same but MUCH more intense. IF ever there was a ""hop bomb"" this is it. This stuff blows your palate up within the first few sips. Well carbonated, but hard to drink much of due to the insane bitterness. Tasty, but not something I'd seek out all that often.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,HosP,4.2,"Received as an extra from Scottfrie in a trade. Thank you!  A: Nice clear pour. Golden color with nice white head that leaves pretty fast. Lacing sticks to sides around the top.  S: Sweet smelling with stronger floral aromas. For a DIPA it's not as strong as one would think.  T: Good bitter DIPA! Starts a little sweeter with the malts, but quickly get to the bitterness and hop flavor. Taste stays with you from sip to sip.  M: Medium body with good carbonation. Bitterness stays with your mouth after the drink.  D: Very solid DIPA. I prefer the bitter ones, so this was a very fine drink. Not a real high ABV, so I could easily drink a few of these at once.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,haddon,4.67,"pours a golden translucent color that looks like liquid gold. massive foamy head that clings to the side of the glass and leaves lots of lacing. great looking beer  Hoplosion on the nose! floral, orange peel and lots of pineapple... very sweet. a faint pine note comes through very nicely  very sweet up front... fruity flavors with the orange & pineapple very apparent. the bitter bite hits on the aftertaste and sits on the back of the throat until your next drink.  medium body with right amount of carbonation. very creamy and smooth. alcohol is not that evident but does add a nice warming sensation on the throat  I really like this beer. it moves to the top of the list in my personal favorite class of beers. it takes my edgy taste to the extreme without being imbalanced. I could drink this beer every day!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,dbossman,4.43,"A: Golden hue with a thick, white, foamy head; delicate, gossimer lacing  S: Grainy, earthy, pine, and floral aromas backed by a pleasant yeastieness; the alcohol also floats above these nodes balancing things nicely  T: Wonderful pine and floral presence; a spicy yeasty flavor permeates through the hops; the grainy malt backbone holds it all together pleasantly; alcohol is well masked  F: Very creamy and well-balanced mouth feel  D: A very drinkable, strong IPA; the hops are well balanced but the bitterness is still pleasantly prevalent; the alcohol is well masked too making this a damn good DIPA from Stone",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mweso2000,4.85,"Now this is a beer! 22 oz. bottle.  The beer pours a little clearer than I expected but a nice golden color. Nice finger width head.  Nice fresh hoppy aroma. The first sip is like a a party in my mouth. Smooth, creamy, great hop taste but not bitter. This beer only got better as I drank it. The second glass was better than the first because it had a chance to warm a little. The bottle recommends that you cellar the beer, but I had mine in the fridge.  I could drink this beer all night, but I would problably end up on the floor if I did. The only drawback, $6.99 for a bottle! Worth it though if you are looking to splurge.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,chickenm,4.4,"Pours a clear copper color with a big fluffy white head that has excellent retention. Citrus hop aroma, with hints of pine. Extremely bitter taste with citrus and pine flavors, and a little caramel malt as well. Leaves a very bitter, dry aftertaste. Medium bodied with a fairly strong carbonation. I really enjoyed this, though with the extreme bitterness I wouldn't drink more than one at once.. this is a palate ruiner. A fantastic beer; if you're a hophead, this one's for you!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Walken,4.38,"Stone: Ruination (Bottled 05/16/10) (Tasted 07/11/10) 12 oz. bottle, poured into a cervoise goblet.  Appearance: Lightly hazed golden amber beer, big creamy bone-white head that leaves some hardcore patches of lace on the sides of the glass and stays intact until the end. Odor: Big-time C-hop aroma, oily and fresh, featuring sharp pithy grapefruit and tangerine fruitiness. Consistency: Smack dab in the center of light bodied with a lush, creamy carbonation. Taste: Bruising grapefruit hop flavor lashes the tongue with a nine-tailed whip that leaves bitter hop resin in searing at the flesh wounds. It amazes me that this beer still registers as being bitter after the numerous IPAs that have gone toe to tongue with my mouth. Malt backbone comes in the form of a semi-solid crackery profile, backed by a light malt sweetness that tries to make headway on the corners of the tongue, but the hops, they do not abide, they tell that sweetness to wait in the car while it handles its business. Clean, crisp finish leaves nothing but bitterness on the palate, alcohol lashes out as well, some pleasant warmth.  This beer is an all out hop assault, with little/no attempt to check the hops with a big malt character and it is exceptional. Clean, crisp and surprisingly drinkable if you enjoy a little hop-abuse.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,RomaniIteDomum,4.12,"Pours hazy yellow with a big fluffy white head.  The nose is full of floral, spice, citrus, and pine.  Citrus is up front folowed by a nice floral and pine bit. Tasty and refreshing.  The feel is light, yet full-bodied. Goes well with the style.  I greatly enjoyed this beer, much like the rest of Stone's lineup. Refreshing and full of depth.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,aval89,4.32,"Pours a nice cloudy/hazy orange color with a clean frothy 1.5 finger head.  Aroma: tropical fruits right off the bat. The big three are mango, pineapple & orange.. A citrus delight. Tropical/fruity goodness :) you also get a wave of that Stone pine aroma. But for the most part the fruits dominate. Almost no booze smell detection. A pleasant smelling brew.  Taste: sweetness upfront. Again you get hit with the same tropical fruits as the nose. Then a GIANT rush of hop bitterness takes over. Oily resin, lots of pine, lots of grapefruit/hoppyness compose the finish. Just what you expect from a Stone double IPA.  Mf is a bit creamy with a medium body. Finishes pretty crisp with a nice hoppy taste lingering on the palate.  For a Stone DIPA, its fairly easy to put down. Has always been one of my favorites..  Cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,TheOtherMike,3.51,"Stone's Pale Ale is one of my ""go to"" beers and as I generally prefer IPAs, I expected greatness in this particular offering. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Maybe it was the strong citrus component of the taste that put me off. I managed to finish-off the six pack but only by drinking one bottle per session and with a meal at that.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,SmithwicksNut,4,"A: Pours a frothy head 1"" in my tall pilsner glass. Cloudy appearence (not transparent), but the color is golden line the sun on a summer morning.  S: The cascade hops come through with a strong citrus fragrance. Grapefruit, mandarin oranges, floral, and a hint of pine. Oh, yeah...they went there.  T: Very smooth for an IPA of this magnitude. Had it side by side with the Stone IPA (standard), and I found this one to be far smoother. Very balanced taste. Very hoppy, but the malt and alcohol counter the punch.  M: Crisp. This beer feels like a 5% beer in your mouth, but then your body starts to warm from the alcohol.  D: For me, I could not drink more than one due to the overall ""size"" of this beer (both hops and alcohol), but it is very balanced.  Overall, this IPA is a great example from Stone, but it greatly surpasses the standard Stone IPA with regard to balance. Regardless of what the label says, it is not that hoppy, so don't be afraid. If you see this beer and are in an IPA mood, I highly recommend it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,basica,4.12,"A - Pours an opaque hazy orange color into my snifter with a nice two-finger thick foamy, milky head with pretty good retention (4)  S - Intense hop aromas on the nose with floral, citrusy and fruity suggestions, grapefruits being the obvious candidate; some grassy hints linger around in the background (4.5)  T - Massive piny hoppiness and some sweetness upfront lifts to reveal pleasantly strong fruity flavors with grapefruits, again, being the most prominent. Malts show up in the middle together with an attack of intense hop bitterness which lasts well into the finish, along with lingering grapefruit flavors (4)  M - Between light and medium bodied thickness with a good level of carbonation and a foamy smooth texture; goes down fairly dry (4)  D - Very good nose and flavors but the bitterness is probably pushing the threshold a little far with 105 IBUs. Otherwise fresh, flavorful and easy drinking; a pity the bitterness is at such an extent and this has definitely detracted the ratings for both taste and drinkability. Definitely not a session nor a starter for someone new to the style. (4)  This is my second Stone Ruination IPA tasting; thanks to Meng, who gave me this bottle after a social tasting session in which someone rejected it flat due to an expectation of what's to come. I am tasting this in a horizontal comparison with 4 other DIPAs and I have to admit that the Ruination way trumps both the DFH 90 and Southern Tier 2XIPA in terms of flavours and nose but the extreme level of bitterness has inevitably took 0.5 off both taste and drinkability. If I am in the mood to go extreme and wreck my palates, I will definitely choose this but more often, I may prefer to go easy. Nonetheless, I will still give credit for the amazing nose and flavors of this great beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,sillajw0,4.35,Appearance: Lighter than i thought it would be but still a darkish yellow-golden color.  Smell: Very hoppy with some nutty backing typical of Stone.  Taste: The first beer i tried of the six i did not particularly like. I gave it another try the next day and was impressed. I think the taste was actually more unique than the Arrogant Bastard. If you think of Double Bastard as a litteral duplication of each to the standard flavors of Arrogant Bastard (nutty and Hoppy) then the Ruination would be a duplication of the hops alone.  Mouth feel: Strong on the front of the tounge but by the time it hits the throat it mellows out.  Drinkability: I will return to this beer on occasion. It is certainly worth drinking.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,DrDemento456,5,"I loved the IPA so when I hear the Ruination IPA was not only with more hop flavor but at 6.99 a bomber at the Monroeville Giant Eagle it was mine that day.  A - Slight haze amber with incredible head and lacing. Lovely.  S - Big hops smell. Smells of strong pine, citrus and grapefruit. Little or no malt smell to speak of.  T - Very hoppy just not as bitter as the Hop Stoopid which I found to be perfect. Flavors are not only balance but refreshing. Very little malt so you have to be careful of your tolerance to bitter beers which I assume is high for me.  M - The label kind of scared me as a palate ruin but I found it opening my evening last beer to a couple other IPA's.  D - Well if I was in the Monroeville area I would have no problem getting another bomber. They were selling the same bombers at D's for 11 dollars which was ridiculous. For the price defiantly worth the brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Baraka,4.97,"A: light gold with a solid head that leaves a good amount of lacing on the glass.  S: From the moment I opened the bomber, the overwhelming smell of hops enveloped me. Dank resiny and citrusy hops dominate the nose. The grapefruit aroma is particularity pungent. This is a very hoppy brew.  T/M: Immediately upon taking a sip the hops hit like a ton of bricks. Major citrus and pine flavors work over my palate and live a lasting resiny hop bitterness that isn't going away anytime soon. Moderate carbonation with a medium body round this baby out. I cannot pick out any malt flavors- any that are in here are so overwhelmed by the beautiful hop assault that they might as well not exist. This is one fantastically hoppy brew!  D: I say without hesitation that this is one of the best beers I have ever had. If Stone distributed to Missouri I would drink this all the time. Since there is absolutely no balance, I wouldn't recommend it to someone who isn't hop-crazy, but for me this beer is mana from heaven. its fairly low ABV make this one of the more sessionable IIPAs around too. It will destroy your palate though, so I wouldn't try to drink anything after it!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mfunk9786,4.53,"My first bottle of this self-proclaimed palate-ruining beer. To be fair, I must disclose that this bottle only has about a month of ideal lifespan left to go, its freshness date is 7/26/2010.  A: Exactly what you'd expect from a DIPA, perhaps with some better filtering than usual. Nice shade of orange with a white head that has great lacing (in fact, if you look straight down into the glass, there's a soapy white haze on top of the beer throughout). Beautiful.  S: Light and citrusy. Missing the big, as my girlfriend angrily calls it, cat piss smell that accompanies a lot of hoppy beers, instead has a nice lemony freshness that makes me wish that Stone was in the car air freshener business as well.  T: Whoa. What I expected to be an overwhelmingly bitter hop bomb ends up tasting somewhere between lemon and grapefruit, a beautiful citrus fruit that exists only in this glass. Just like the magnificent Nugget Nectar from Troegs, this beer has a very juicy hop character that flies in the face of the piney hop flavor that most of us are accustomed to.  M: Dry, like a very nice glass of white wine might be.  D: This beer is extremely sessionable in my opinion, which might end in a baaad night if you don't control yourself. Has a 'yellow Pez' character (what I characterized Citron vodkas as in college) to it that is absolutely irresistible. Instantly one of my favorite DIPAs, it's just a shame about the six-pack price.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,uustal,4.03,"Great orange pour with a thick, creamy, white head. Hops on the nose. Citrus, grapefruit, orange, pine and floral hop aroma. The taste follows. BIG hop flavor. Citrus, orange and lemon zest, grapefruit, pine and floral hops out front. A small amount of dark fruit and caramel malt give the beer a hidden sweetness, but the hops overpower this before long. Alcohol has a small presence, especially as you get further into the better. This one finishes very bitter as advertised as the pine hops scold the tongue and leave a big dry flavor. Huge tasting double IPA. All about showing off the hops.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Clydesdale,4.62,"A: Pours a glowing, luminescent orange-bronze. The head is fairly tall and has a similar tint, along with a very thick, frothy texture. Retention is quite sturdy, and a full lattice of lacing sticks persistently to the glass.  S: Very little in the way of malt - mostly cookielike pale malt, with a trace of caramel. Hop aromas are big and bright, with pine resin, grapefruit pith, and lemon zest. Also a bit of grassy/herbal character.  T: Some mild cookielike sweetness up front, with light caramel notes. For a purely hop-driven beer, that's a pretty ideal malt presence, since it allows the hop flavors to steal the show. Big, bitter citric notes of grapefruit and lemon, with secondary piney and grassy flavors backing them up. As promised, bitterness is bracing and long-lasting, sticking around long after each sip is swallowed. Alcohol, at 7.7%, is well hidden and a bit sneaky.  M: Medium-full body. Carbonation is medium and appropriate for the style. Smooth and resiny up front. A full, riding bitter dryness into the finish. As mentioned, alcohol is perfectly masked and adds only a subtle warmth.  D: A very nice DIPA from Stone. Certainly hop-dominated, but this demonstrates substantial finesse in a style that, to some, doesn't seem to warrant any. A textbook example of a bitter, aggressively hopped double IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,matjack85,4.32,"The Glen Ellyn Binny's store was selling single 12oz bottles of this stuff for $2.99, so I picked one up.  The beer poured out a medium golden/orange color with a 1 finger white head that stayed around a couple of minutes before fading to a white rim. The beer left tons of lacing on the glass with each sip.  Big citrus hop aroma along with some piny hops as well.  This stuff is delicious. Grapefruit and piny hops dominate as you would expect in a beer with a 105 IBU rating, but despite the overwhelming hop presence, there is enough sweet malt in here to help smooth it out. It would be wrong to say the malt balances the hops because there is just too much hoppiness in here to ever hope to be balanced. but the malt certainly is a welcome addition.  This is smooth with a lighter than expected mouthfeel and with a moderately high carbonation level which keeps it crisp and refreshing. The finish is dry but with a slight lingering bitter aftertaste.  With a 7.7% abv. I was amazed that I couldn't taste the alcohol, but I really couldn't detect it at all. Very easy to drink and I would drink it more often if it wasn't for the $18 a six pack price.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,PanicUnited,4.77,"Since most people simply want to know how this beer holds up in comparison to other beers of similar price/style (IPA)..  Stone makes one hell of a beer, and this IPA is no different. It has a dry, but flavorful feel and should be enjoyed slowly.

147,4083,Star80,3.89,"Went and paid my arm and my leg for this brew, meanwhile the local denizens were looking for Victoria, why? This beer is a very pale golden color in my Sam Adams (read that right, love the glass) glassware, and very pale at the bottom of the glass, crystal clear, filtered beer. I wonder, why filter? The Bell's I drank last night was unfiltered, and that definitely adds something, a complexity...anyway, smells great!!! The smell of those citrusy hops knocks you back, I swear I wish they could just bottle those huge Cascade whiffs you get upon first crack of the bottle....mouthfeel was lighter than expected for this style of beer, CA IPA. Let me sum it up by saying Stone is a great brewery in the California high hop style, but out here in Chicagoland, i won't pay premium over SN again, I feel like Torpedo is about on the same level, and Sierra Nevada is the real deal, original homey-feel.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Taste is just right for a DIPA, subtle honey malt note that is quickly overwhelmed by a piney bitter dose of hops that explodes in the mouth. The alcohol is evident and warming, well-integrated.

Smells very resinous and intense, i could smell the hops as soon as I opened the bottle and began to pour. I knew what I was in for.  Extremely hop forward, I get sappy pine notes, not much citrus or fruits, but plenty of resinous herbs. Very earthen and rustic taste. Resins of hops and the perfect malt profile give it a slight sweetness.  A perfect body for this beer, medium, with moderate carbonation. On the first taste, I could feel the hops grip my palate and coat my entire mouth. finishes quite dry and bitterness lingers.  The great taste makes it highly drinkable, but I am not even a 1/3rd of the way through it and i can already feel the buzz. Something about stone brews really get me.

Charcoal notes, brutally hoppy and mouth coating. Excellent.  M. Slightly carbonated  D. I immediately fell in love with this beer so much that I ordered another couple of bottles. I am not a fan of IPA'S but I have been somewhat converted through this beer. I could happily drink this all night long. A genuine classic. Leaves a nice lacing on the glass.  Had a second tasting of this on 23/08/10 and I got one or two different aromas in this bottle but I think I prefer the strength of the aromas in the first offering yet I found this second bottle to be more to my liking yet strangely I still preferred the first bottle I had. Are you still following??  The aromas in the second one are of cloudy lemonade, not as heavy hops on the nose this time, bready, hints of honey and maybe melon. Also a whiff of vinegar but a positive vinegar scent.  This one tastes slightly salty, bready and a good hoppiness but not as overpowering as my first sample",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Foxtrot,4.42,"Just doing some re-reviewing, gotta check on taste and palate changes.  Bomber into Stone IRS snifter produces a body clear gold. Head was two finger as before, somewhat sticky and slowly recedes into a light foam with modest lacing.  Aroma is certainly not lacking in the hop department. For a ""fizzy yellow beer"" it certainly packs quite a wallop. Sticky pine and resin are quickly noted, with big notes of candied pineapple and sugar crusted grapefruit. The nose is almost as enjoyable as the beer itself; fills the room with all things hops.  First sip assaults the taste buds with pungent hop bitterness up front. The hop bitterness slowly subsides into a modest amount of pine resin, lemon peel and grapefruit. I know I sound like a broken record when I say this, but the hops just don't stop. The hoppiness is prominent throughout the entire session and leaves a nice floral aftertaste to savor before the next sip.  Mouthfeel is good, but just a tad light. It has a nice silkiness, but for a DIPA, it could be better to hold out against the hops.  Drinkability seems better than I remembered. I could hardly finish a bomber a year ago, but now it seems much easier to sip and savor for such a big beer. Big props to Stone for giving this beer a sessionable quality.  ---  Reviewed 01/07/2009  4/4.5/4.5/4/4  Poured from bomber into pint glass.  A - Poured a very nice straw amber/orange color with a good two finger head that dissipates rather quickly.  S - Very intense aromas of grapefruit, pine, and HOPS! I could barely keep this thing away from my nose it was so good.  T - The taste of this beer is quite magnificent. Lots of pine and multiple citrus flavors (grapefruit, and a twang of lemon/lime). Not a whole lot malts, this was a very one sided brew. Despite this, it was still very smooth and enjoyable.  M - Good carbonation, just what I expected from this style.  D - Good drinkability, but the high ABV and palate shock after having this beer is staggering. Definitely make this the last thing to drink.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Hops are very aromatic. Very refreshing beer.  Mouthfeel - is very good. Flavors stick to and line your tongue and the roof of you mouth.

M - Loaded with effervescence, some slickness and oil hops ... medium to heavy body.  D - Obviously a hop lover's dream.

There also seems to be the slightest twinge of malt playing with the hops as well, though the malt is easily overwhelmed by the arse kicking hops.  T & M - The flavor is Hoptastic (or would that be Hoptacular?) Big earthy and citrus hops dominate the flavor, and again, there is just the slightest bit of malt to help balance things out. The alcohol is very well masked and I certainly would not have guessed that this is a 7.7% ABV brew. Medium bodied with a creamy, mouth coating, sort of mouthfeel.

147,4083,ChadQuest,4.14,"Golden colored with a bit of tangerine hue to it.  personally the Aromatics are one of the big reasons i love DIPAs, so other beer style has such a captivating aroma to it that almost crave one for the scent alone. Ruination is darn solid in this dept, not the absolute best(hopslam,pte), but one to keep in mind that is very easily available anytime. its got a great citrus peel, with a little bit of tropical thrown in, and that tropical notes are what keeps me coming back.  i could tell this was a fresh bottle, and it confirms i am withen the freshness date. nice and bitter upfront with the same tropical and tangerine and clemintine hop flavors, and since this is from san diego there isnt much of any malt to speak of, but a bit of bready qualities in lite kisses.  I love the carbination of this beer, its medium to full carbs, with a slightly viscious body, just slightly, enough that it is at home in your glass in summer and winter months.  Good price and a great beer, now that its available in chicago i will probally get it often.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

M - Medium with moderate carbonation. Bubbly and refreshing!  D - Amazing DIPA, 22oz goes down easy.

M- Smooth, slightly creamy, could be a light heavier.  D- Just great. The reason I bought this was the fast the the bottle said ""100+ IBU's"" and it delivers.

Not much else to say that anyone else hasn't covered. It's an absolute hop bomb, full of floral aromas and flavors, nice fruity hoppiness to it, amazing mouth feel. Finishes so smooth and clean, hard to find anything wrong with this beer... for the ABV it is super drinkable, I could easily down a few of these no problems.

Mango, tangerine, lemon and a lot of grapefruit.  T: Really reminiscent of the smell. Lots of tropical fruits. Pineapple, mango, tangerine, lemon and tons and tones of grapefruit. Some floral hops also present. Finally some kind of fruity sweetness that goes perfectly with the brew.  M: Mid to heavy AFAIR with medium carbonation. What you'd expect.

147,4083,brewerburgundy,4.22,"22oz bottle, Sam Adam glass, 'Enjoy By 06 24 10'.  Pale but rich straw yellow with darker, full tones leaning towards orange but not crossing the line. There is a creamy eggshell head that disippated for the most part but still clings to the glass well.  Huge mango in the nose that is backed up by pine. The whole hop presence is leaning towards tropical but is mostly pine and mango with some honey sweetness. Any way I slice it, this is immensely pleasing, There is a solvent, cheap vodka-like alcohol that develops and while it can be off putting, it signals a good ole dry West Coast IPA.  Slightly bready malt, a little honey sweetness, soapy and citric bitterness. The hop flavors are a mix of grapefruit and pine.  Dry and therefore not too thick in the mouth, this beer falls off slightly in this category with a little overly fizzy carbonation.  Even at 7.7% ABV this one is getting to me. I love it, but the bitterness is lovely because it is palate wrecking, and therefore not very drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Potent aroma of orange, grapefruit, and pine resin, with slight hints of the toasted malts in the background of this hop bomb. Taste follows smell with strong hops front to back. Solid medium body, ample carbonation, sticky finish with hop oils coating the mouth.

147,4083,BlackHaddock,3.77,"A pint glass poured for me at Pour 24 (New York, New York), Las Vegas.  The beer has an orange hue to its amber body, on top sat a thin off-white head of random sized bubbles.  The smell was your typical hop head US IPA, meaning a selection of hop aromas, each trying to outmanoeuvre and control the variety of its mates within the brew.  The taste/flavours are also all hop, some malt is there in the background, but the hops that dominate the smells change around so other hops take centre stage in the bitterness stakes.  Obviously the hops rule this beer, but it has other factors (unbalanced/yet different/engaging/yet annoyingly nasty) which help to make it worth finding, glad I did.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Perfect fluffy white head that stuck around for a while and left great lacing with each sip.  Burst of citrus and pine along with the hops on the nose. The hoppiness is floral and very strong. Exceptional.  The taste is bold. Big big hops with grapefruit. This is a strong hoppy beer but there is some sweetness to add a bit of balance. Not as bitter on the finish as I would have expected.  Medium bodied and crisp mouthfeel. A good, moderate amount of carbonation.  Extremely drinkable for the style.  For me, this beer IS DIPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Manoftyr,4.87,"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass  Appearance-Pours a pale yellow with light tinges of orange giving it a practically golden character. A sumptuous fluffy white head rises from the pour and slowly settles itself back down.  Aroma-Oooh, wow; this beer is an upfront attack of sweet, sticky, zesty, citric hops; I smell lemon, orange, pear and a variety of other fruity smells amidst a piny kind of woodsiness. Even though the hoppy smell is prominent and upfront it doesn't obliterate the malty, buttery undercurrents; a testament to the craftsmanship that went into this brew.  Taste-An initial flood of bitter-sweet, sticky, piny and zesty-fruity hops leads off rather suddenly into an undercurrent of caramel malty sweetness that adds a powerful depth of character to the overall flavor. The hops don't dwindle and remain in the forefront all the way into the finish lending all their flavor and character yet still without utterly overwhelming the malty undercurrents. There is no alcohol on the palette whatsoever, it is completely and utterly masked.  Mouthfeel-Thick and creamy without being heavy, it's all kinds of perfect for what the brewers were going for.  Drinkability-Perfectly drinkable, I could have this all damned day.  Notes-This *was* my favorite DIPA, until I had my first Pliny The Elder; now it's been firmly relegated to a rather distant second, it's still an awesome DIPA though.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I liked IPA's but this one was too much for me. For some reason, I always just looked past it since then. It's about time I revisited it!  The beer pours a hazy copped with a fluffy head and beautiful lacing. I tend not to trust a clear IIPA. The aroma is grassy, herbal and overwhelmingly citrusy hops. The pungent grapefruit alludes to the bitterness to come. A bit of sweet caramel malt pokes through upfront in the flavor, followed by more big, bold grapefruity bitterness. The intense resiny bitterness lingers for what seems like an eternity, I feel like I was just chewing on some fresh cones! The alcohol is masked, but the extreme bitterness lets you know you are drinking a fairly strong beer. This is one nasty IIPA!

Man, the hops steal the show and are sharp and spicy. Has a nice rich body, as it slides over the tongue. I know there is some malt and yeast in there behind the hops!  Deep in the end there may have been some phenols and citrus.  Stone was right, it caused ruination to the palate.  I am no extreme hop head but I can tell its a winner of an IPA.

147,4083,Gyle41386,4.21,"Poured from a bomber into a tulip.  Orange-amber pour with about two fingers of dense white foam. Head retention is pretty good. Most of the glass is coated with sticky lacing. Perfection.  Hugely hoppy nose. Hugely hoppy, in that I got a solid whiff of pine as I removed the cap. Once the beer is in the glass, it explodes with citrus (grapefruit/orange) and pine scents. Very pleasant aroma, surprisingly pleasant for a beer with a name like Ruination.  It's funny. I first had Ruination in the very early stages of my craft beer exploration. Now, having tried it again for the first time in months, and after having countless world-class IPA's and Double IPA's, Ruination's palate-wrecking bitterness is even more apparent. Definitely tasting much more citrus than pine, which always works for me. The finish is very resinous and bitter, yet not harshly so. It's certainly a very bitter beer, and, weirdly, my tongue even feels different after finishing it, yet it's still delicious and a treat to drink.  I say this way too often, but Double/Imperial IPA's have my favorite texture of any style of beer. Ruination follows suit. Just shy of full-bodied, full-flavored, and with soft carbonation. Very silky, creamy feel. I don't notice the 7.7% ABV in any way.  Who knew a bazillion IBU Double IPA could be so drinkable? Maybe I am worthy, after all. Another absolute classic from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Prostman81,4,"A terrific offering from Stone. I have had plenty of the regular Stone IPAs, and wasn't sure how different this one was going to be, but it did deliver. Color is a tad deeper golden than the regular IPA. Hops aroma is a bit more complex, although not overwhelmingly so. Taste seems to me like a richer, hoppier Stone IPA, with more emphasis on the citrus flavors, rather than the uni-demensional hop profile of regular IPA. So smooth and easy drinking for a 7.7% beer. Would highly recommend checking this one out, and would advise drinking a 12 oz serving of this before sessioning other beers to appreciate the excellent blending of flavors Stone did here.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Smell: Strong floral hops and a somewhat nutty malt aroma.  Taste: Very bitter. Intense bitterness characterizes this beer, living up to the 'ruination' moniker. There's decent balance from the malts, but this is really a hop poem, as the label states. Additionally, and rather curiously, there's a certain ""ashenness"" here. This threw me off at first, but now I really enjoy it.  Mouthfeel: Crisp and tangy; medium body.  Drinkability: This IPA is just a little bit different from most others I've had, and I like it a lot. It's strong, but not as strong as many American IPAs, and I could easily drink two or three of these in a session (and wind up pretty drunk as a result, probably).  Stone Brewing Company, for all its humorous boasting, never really fails to deliver great beer, and they certainly didn't botch this one. Wassail, my friends.

Moderately hazy, the ale pulls off, on third pour, a finger of head that has legs.  S: Orange peel and grapefruit dominate, a syrupy sweet bitterness that is wicked bitter. The hoppiness is as floral as it is sharp, covering up all traces of malt (and therefore all semblance of balance).  T: The floral intricacies of the nose disappear in the face of an all-out assault on the senses (at least taste). The hops are a wall of bite, sharp and nearly unending. The devil is in the details though, as smaller sips reveal the breadth of the hops. The floral flavors are there, just look for 'em, along with the orange peel. Unfortunately a heavy-handed alcohol comes along for the ride. The ale lacks balance, plain and simple. Lots of hops, I like that. Too much booze, I don't like that.  M: Without the booze I really like the ale. The hops are floral and full, awesome in their own right.  D: Under 8%? That surprises the hell out of me. It feels like it should be twice that.

Smells great but seemed better while still in the bottle. Once you get used to the hops and it gets warmer, some sniffs only reveal the hot alcohol.  T- This really surprised me. I've had stronger and more bitter but never such a hop kick. Hard for me to describe the malt because the citrus/pine/bubblegum hops are all over the place. Vodka like alcohol. I'm still tasting something rotten in it.  M- Good mouthfeel. Perfect carbonation. More body would help I think.  D- Very easy to drink. I'm holding myself back so I don't down it in a single gulp.

Many speak of Double IPAs stating that they ""have a good malty balance"". To be honest, I could do without that balance. I need a beer that will ""show me the hoppy"". Look no further than the Ruination",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,TCHopCraver,3.96,"A: Pours a slightly murky, golden-orange into an oversized wine glass. Its one-finger head is pure white and leaves some wild sticky lacing on the sides of the glass. There is a dancing man contained in said lacing.  S: I mostly smell bitter citrus notes, some lemon peel and really bitter grapefruit. A decent amount of dry biscuit mingles with the hop aromas and a hint of pine complements the citrusy hop smells. There is not much balance to this aroma; the semi-sweet, caramel malt backbone that I crave in an IPA is absent. I think this absence leads to a bit of a transparent, watery smell.  T: An alpha acid hop-drop kick to the tongue is pretty much how I would describe the Ruination IPA. The lemon peel and bitter grapefruit aromas translate almost perfectly to the taste, but as the palate warms to the flavor, some sweeter orange and tangerine notes emerge. This is a pleasant surprise, as I was thinking my tongue would just be abused throughout the duration of my tasting experience. That said, this beer is a little light on an appropriate malt balance.  M: Relatively light bodied in the mouth, but with a killer hop backbeat on my taste buds, like a Steve Gadd/hop love-child. My brain says that I should crave a fuller malt balance from the mouthfeel, but my hop loving mouth says ""nah, man, just let the bitterness dominate me. It's cool.""  D: Pri-tay goood. I will have another in the future, but I do think the price tag is a quite steep at $3 plus per bottle. That is a little silly.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

This is some serious stuff  T- a delicious citrus and earthy brew. It moves in on the taste profile initially. The malty profile does finish the adventure. This is a tasty trial of brews. I wish the bitterness stayed though  M- medium...carbonated...trying to live up to th previous grades  D- this is a great west coast hops assault. I like it and will always enjoy in MODERATION.

147,4083,gordonsliquor,4.87,Stone ruination really shows you how a real IPA should taste! The hop aroma is unbelievablely strong.The mouthfeel is great and i love the pi ne.

147,4083,Deingeist,3.83,"Poured a clear dark amber, with two fingers worth of uniformally smooth head that dwindled down to a thin cover over time, not much lacing.  Smelled of green citrus, unripe lemons/oranges or limes, clean hops, not too yeasty.  Spicy hops and citrus up front, then smooth feeling malt (considering the 7.7% alcohol) it was the eye of the storm however as the finish is quite a bitter punch. It's bitterness did not quite live up to it's name but it was really bitter. I'm almost glad considering if it were more bitter it wouldn't have had much drinkability.  Felt smooth, not too thin, not too oily, a little prickly up front, if it had been colder it would have been quite refreshing.  Some might find this beer very drinkable, but it's a stronger IPA and it took me some sipping. I could have drank a couple if they were colder. For a beer this flavorful it's quite drinkable, but I'd drink regular old Stone IPA if I was planning to have several.  Note* As an artist, the package and bottle are really cool, I love the near tacky green and gold screen print, it's really awesome. I love painted/inked bottles.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,zimm421,4.35,"Poured from a 22 oz bomber into a snifter. Appears a dark orange color with a golden tint. Very hazy, with a nice thick white head that leaves nice lacing as it dissipates.  Smells strongly of hops. Lots of pine and citrus, specifically grapefruit. There are some hints of malts, but the hops are just overpowering. The taste starts with lots of citrus, the grapefruit again, and some orange and pine. There are some malts in the taste as well, but this is so bitter they really hide in the background. This finishes very bitter and lingers for a long time after each sip. As this warms, the tastes really begin to stand out. I get more grassy and earthy notes, as well as alcohol the more the beer warms.  The mouthfeel is surprisingly smooth, and has a below average amount of carbonation. This is a medium bodied, but leaves a good deal of lining in the mouth with each sip. It's a little difficult to drink because of the huge amounts of hops, but it is a great brew.

147,4083,ktrillionaire,4,"On-tap at Datz Deli in Tampa.  A - Pours a brassy amber with a nice persistent white foam, not much lace.  S - The smell is citric, similar to green (unripe) oranges, with a fragrant floral essence, as well.  T - The taste is a balance of a sharply flavored malt, tempered by a strange combination of bitterness. Green oranges, again, and something almost cabbage-y, definitely earthy.  M - (2x)IPA. Good.  D - This beer is pretty damn drinkable. At least it was, until I noticed the Weyerbacher Double Simcoe on-tap.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Pittsburgh,3.85,"I am re-reviewing this beer, my initial review was a better, but having this again, I am realizing the bitterness is a bit too much for me and knocking the taste down a little for me. Initial taste is good, but the bitterness that comes after is too much in my opinion, I think they overdid it. Still a good beer, but I don't think I would make this a regular in my IPA rotation or regular beer rotation for that matter.  I like it, but don't like the after-taste. I think its a bit over-rated, and I feel like for all the hype, it should be a better overall beer.  If you like bitter, you will like this. I like bitter, but there is not much else that is balancing it out for me. As the beer went on the bitterness factor dropped, and I was actually really enjoying it by the end, but that 1st few sips....bitter as all hell",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Grapefruit comes to the forefront along with a faint pine scent.  T - VERY BITTER HOPS. Citrus. Somewhat of a pine/floral background. All hops. No malt profile anywhere to be found. After a few gulps the bitterness becomes more subdued and this turns in to a very nice grapefruit-hop profile with a bitterness that follows.  M - Light to medium body. A good amount of carbonation.

147,4083,Tomdee74,4.1,"My grade will probably come out to an A, but overall I'd like to summarize this as an A- to B+ beer. I think it's a tad overrated. It is good, don't get me wrong, but there are some really good ipas out there. In my opinion it doesn't measure up to a smuttynose big a ipa and it actually just contends with harpoon leviathan and hop wallop when we talk about DIPAs I can get here in CT. Doesn't come close to a Hopslam or a Pliny. And I don't mean to bad mouth this. i'm drinking this and I really am enjoying it.  A - Poured into a tulip glass and i love the head and lacing. nice head and even better lacing.  S- The one I'm drinking might be a tad old as the smell is not so pungent; however, I've had this before and fresh it smells really good. lots of pineapple/citrus/floral notes.  T - A nice hoppy taste to this. I do like the floral citrus notes to this. The carbonation is really good. This is not a huge alcohol blast thankfully and the abvs are low which i like. they are also very well hidden.  D - I actually rate this pretty high. It is tasty. I don't mean to bash this at all, but i do think it is overpriced and a tad overrated. i live in ct so maybe its the shipping charges that make this so expensive. and a sign over it to say that it is ""perhaps the best ipa in america"" doesn't help and automatically sets the bar way too high before tasting it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Appearance: golden amber, semi-translucent, about a finger of head  Smell: love the smell, very fruity  Taste: First taste the sweetness, then the bitterness follows as you swallow  Mouthfeel: leaves the mouth feeling a little dry  Drinkability: very drinkable, doesn't have the alcohol that I am used to with the DIPAs. I could drink a few of these.  Overall, I am a little disappointed. I guess I had in mind something better than Hopslam.

There is a citrusy orange/lemon, grassy, floral, hoppy nose. Upon tasting, the hops are intense and up-front. Some malty breadiness supports it but this IS a hop-bomb. Crisp and clean taste that follows the nose. Some grapefrui and lemon. bitter aftertaste leaves a serious pucker. I LIKE it!

Appearance: Pours cloudy golden color with a large off-white head that dissipates very, very slowly and leaves behind thick lacing.  Smell: The strongest hop aromas I've ever smelled- nuttiness and earthy aromas, with hints of grassiness and some herbal hints as well.  Taste: VERY BITTER- A slight hint of bready malt in the beginning, but after that its all very earthy and slightly nutty hop flavors. This is so hoppy that the first sip gave me chills. Leaves a somewhat buttery aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Medium to thick body with balanced carbonation and a very dry finish.  Drinkability: The hoppiness of this beer means that it's definitely a sipper. However, it's very good. Overwhelming amounts of hops aren't exactly my thing, so while I wouldn't drink this much, I like it a lot.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Smell: Grassy, earthy hops dominate, as expected. Some sweet malty notes also come out in the smell.  Taste: Wow, this is pretty intensely hoppy. Stone doesn't lie when they tell you to approach their beers with caution. This is definitely not for the uninitiated. It's so hoppy it almost hurts. Grassy and earthy hops absolutely dominate this beer. There are subtle malty flavors in the background.  Mouthfeel: Crisp and full-bodied with an exceptionally clean finish. Everything you could ask for.  Drinkability: A great beer! This is one I'll definitely look for again.

I can sense some sweet malts trying to escape, but they are being overpowered by the hops  T: Starts off with grapefruit, which then makes its way to some nice floral notes, followed by pineyness and orange zest. Some toasted maltiness is in the background, but it really takes a backseat to the hops. This is ridiculously bitter. Finishes with the grapefruit again, with a lingering bitterness afterwards. Very bitter, but still enjoyable  M: Medium bodied, with just enough carbonation. Goes down smooth, but leaves a bit of hop oil residue in the mouth, but i expected this  D: A bit of a challenge due to the hoppiness, but still enjoyable. I could have one or two of these but after a while, i think the hops would overbear  Overall, this is a great stone offering and great DIPA.

Taste: Strong hoppy bitterness up front with hints of toasted malt. Definite hints of floral sweetness hiding beneath the bitterness. Bitter grapefruit rind finish. The flavor of the hops is definitely packed in. Bitterness is off the charts.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Fairly dry finish.

Smells of citrusy hops, grapefuit  Taste is of strong citrus and floral hops. The hops leave a bitterness in the mouth. Leaves an odd aftertaste after the first few sips. Not very complex, and lacks character.  Mouthfeel is average. A medium body, medium carbonation, that bites the tongue a bit. Finishes dry.  Drinkability is average. It's not a hard beer to drink considering the ABV. I still wouldn't follow this bomber up with another one.  Overall, this beer doesn't do it for me nearly as much as I had hoped. I had high hopes considering Stone just came into Chicago, and after reading the reviews and trying Arrogant Bastard, I was ready to be wowed. It's not bad, it's just not great.

147,4083,Byeast,4.17,"Appearance: a slightly pale and gold with some orange tone, slight cloudy quality, an overall bright appearance, the head starts as a solid half inch of bright white foam then quickly diminishes to a soapy thin layer atop the brew. This layer slides down the glass after each sip,slick lace.  Smell: Lots of hop aromas, grapefruit rind, lightly soapy and oily hop, some sweeter aromas underneath the strong hops, some alcohol, hint of peach and a slight bit of sweet bready malt. Inviting.  Taste: Smacks of hops! Raw and oily citric hop flavor abounds, just loads and loads of hops in my mouth! Bitter for sure but delightfully so, showcasing the flavor of an onslaught of hops. The malt is there though, providing just enough buttery malt background. But balanced is not the word i would use, the hops have definitely tipped the scale, in fact the scale fell over from all of the wonderful hops crammed into this beer. There are subtle tones of fruity citrus- grapefruit and tangerine, and a bit of warm alcohol. The flavor linger in the mouth for ages. A hophead treat.  Mouthfeel: nice carbonation, slick and slightly creamy feel.  Drinkability: Now, this is not a beer i would recommend to someone who is new to ipa's. I think only those who enjoy a good hop kick now and then would like it. I think it great, but as the name and description warns, it will ruin your palate for a little while, like a hop punch to the mouth.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Poured into a pint glass, nice light amber color, decent head with minimal to no real lacing.  The first thing I really took in was the smell. There were beautiful aromas of sweet flowers and deep complex hops.  This was a very tasty beer, but the flavor was not as complex as the smell I felt. Very strong and up-front hop bitterness with a light fruit sweetness on the finish.  I'd score the beer higher for drinkability but I don't think I could drink more than one bottle in a sitting, and as the beer warmed up the bitterness slowly grew overpowering.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Aroma of resinous pine, grapefruit rind, tropical fruits, tangerine. I remember this being a bit more pungent, maybe it needs to warm slightly.  The first thing that hits the palette is soft malt sweetness, which is then followed by a huge hop onslaught. Big and pungent with salty hop leaf, grapefruit rind, underripe navel oranges, lots of pine sap. A lingering orangey-bitterness that drags its way through the back of the palette.  Medium body with a slick feel and a low level carbonation. Fits well, nothing to brag about I suppose.  This is supposed to be the monster-of-all DIPAs, and as such it drinks pretty easily. I have to say though, I have many DIPAs, IPAs, and even Barleywines that are way more hop forward in terms of hop character and raw bitterness. This bottle is fresh too, so it's not as if I had a old sample or anything. I guess this beer, for me, doesn't live up to the hype. Not bad by any means, but certainly not that great. More intensity is in order for this to be a truly amazing beer  --Update-- Got another bottle courtesy of the wife, and it's just like it's supposed to be.

147,4083,weatherdog,3.42,"On tap at Brixies in Brookfield IL served in a 10oz. snifter. This was my first local Stone beer purchase since they came to Chicago a few days ago.  It pours a hazy amber with a dense head and just a touch of lacing that clung to the glass.  The nose was just an absolute explosion of piny resinous hops. A little bit of orange citrus sneaks in there as well at the end. Its a huge noseful of hops and as the name suggests this is probably going to be an assault on my mouth.  First and foremost an overwhelming spicy type bitterness hits me and doesn't let go until well after I had finished the beer. The flavor of the bitterness is piny and grassy and seems as if I had extracted pure alpha acids and mixed it with some tre sap. Make no mistake this is the most one sided DIPA I've ever had and doesn't even attempt any sense of putting some malt flavor in the beer. While I don't fault that approach on principle this example lacks the cohesiveness I've found in other similar beers. In addition to the hop flavors, a fair amount of alcohol taste was present. This was surprising at only 7.7% ABV and I'm sure a pound of hops per bottle and it didn't make for a better taste.  The redeeming feature in this beer was the mouthfeel. The beer was full bodied with a nice creamy mouthfeel and a perfect amount of carb in order to put forth an effort to rid my mouth of the pure bitterness.  Drinkability was average at best but not all of that was attributed to the insane bitterness. The alcohol presence was just off putting.  I can appreciate this beer for what it claims to be, an utter assault on your palette, but i just don't see what the long term appeal to this beer is. I guess I just prefer my DIPA's with less bitterness and a better hop taste.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Very clean, citrus/pine smell that never gets old. I treated this beer like a fine wine and inhaled before every sip.  I must say, at first taste, the name and story on the bottle isn't just a marketing gimmick. The chips I was snacking on tasted like cardboard after having this ruin my pallate. The hoppiness is up front smacking you in the face waking you up. Citrus notes in the taste as well.  For the amount of intensity and hoppy bitterness, this beer is relatively easy to drink and I found myself enjoying the bomber faster than I had planned as I felt a bit of the alcohol, which I try to avoid. It does give a bit of a sting on the tongue but nothing uncomfortable and something I expect from a beer of this potency.  This wont be my staple beer as its a bit intense, but this is completely an indulgence beer to anticipate and enjoy from time to time.

Smell: So sick. Hoppity hops on the nose. Floral, citrus, and earthy hop aromas all combine to create a fantastic smell. The grapefruit citrus aroma seems to be the most prominent. Pale malt sweetness is also present.  Taste: How they squeeze over 100 IBU's into this monster is a secret I cannot unravel. It actually starts off a little bit soft, with some pale malt sugar dripping some sweetness over the strong citrus flavor. Almost immediately, however, the hops establish dominance and do not let go. The different hop flavors - pine, citrus, and floral, all combine to add flavor without becoming overwhelmingly bitter. That is not to say this is not a huge beer. It beat my taste buds into a numbed submission, and I felt the bitter taste in my mouth fifteen minutes after finishing it. The alcohol only appears as a mild reminder of what a strong beer you are drinking toward the end of the sip.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, above average carbonation. Surprisingly smooth.  Drinkability: Numbing your mouth is a double edged sword. Nothing else tastes the same, so you may as well have another Ruination.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The aroma is full of hop goodness, very citrusy (grapefruit, orange and lemons) and somewhat sweet from the malts.  Sugar sprinkled ripe ruby grapefruit, orange, lemon leap out from the flavor with a strong pale malt backbone backing things up while hanging out in the background. Piney and resinous hop flavors twine around the citrus in equal amounts as well. There is bitterness in plenty but mostly in the finish and is not overpowering. Alcohol is nearly invisible and mostly tasted as a warming on the finish.  Mouthfeel is medium and creamy with nicely done carbonation that combines with the alcohol to tease the palate as a warming tingle.

The snifter I'm using usually is pretty resistant to lacing, but Ruination manages to leave nice webs of it. Near perfect-looking for an IPA. Incredible grapefruit scent bursts through right upon opening the bottle. Citrus and pine hide behind it. Oh, and hops, hops, hops.The smell says ""you're about to be assaulted by hops"". But alas, the taste isn't quite as hoppy as the nose and labeled 100+ IBU's would hint towards. I have had this a few times before and remember it being a bit more intense. I'm getting a big caramel/biscuit malt taste reminiscent of Stone's regular IPA. Tingly, bitter hops and grapefruit taste as it goes down. Tiny bite from the booze pops up now and then but mostly stays very hidden. A bit boozier in the finish. Mouthfeel is great and creamy, carbonation is perfect. Drinkability is very close to a 4.5, however I chose to give it a 4 mostly because this is very heavy, not sure I'd want to have more than one of these. Also the price is high, if this was a couple bucks cheaper for a 6-pack I'd buy it often. Yes, this does seem a bit like Stone IPA on steroids, but what damn fine steroids those are. Maybe my favorite Double IPA so far, that is, until a certain Elder arrives at my door...  Edit - I liked Ruination more than PtE, lolz.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jpmclaug,3.91,"Poured from a growler into my Duvel Tulip (Growler from Greens on Piney Grove Columbia, SC)  A - Glowing orange-amber with a big off white head, lots of bubbles run up the side of the glass, above average amount of lacing sticking to the glass  S - Rather mild nose. Strong lemon smell with hints of sweet malt.  T - Piney hops dominant the flavor. A hint of sweetness when it first hits my tongue but that gives way to a lingering piney bitterness.  M - Well carbonated with a medium body  D - Not a real hard one to drink but I'm not the biggest fan of piney DIPA's.

Slightly piney, but all very mild, even as it warms up to room temperature. I've had some realy great DIPA's lately and expect that fragrent Hopslam pine and citrus smell.  T&M: Sturdy medium body with a smooth mouth feel. Some floral and slightly piney hops taste with a bit of malt. Next is the hop bitterness which is piney, citrus rind, and woody flavors.

Taste is the same but less lemony. Just like a brisk and delicious iced tea. Floral hops, clean malt, dry hoppy finish.  Medium body, moderate-light carbonation, creamy mouthfeel. Clean and crisp.

Tons and tons of citrus hops in the front and a sweeter background than the nose would lead you to believe. Also no alcohol in the taste. This all attributes to a wonderfully balanced yet very bitter DIPA.  The mouthfeel is full bodied with good carbonation that fully coats the tongue.

147,4083,Briken,4.42,"A very nice cloudy gold orange with a medium off white head. A superbly rich hopa aroma just fills you up. It's a preperation for the hop overload the first sip has prepared for you. Hops smack you upside the head and permeate the tongue. But, if you think that's all there is and give up too quickly, you'll miss out. After that wonderful hopshock subsides and your taste buds begin to recover, the complex flavors begin to take shape. A light malt sweetness comes through the bitterness as well as the grapefruit and floral hop flavors start to shine. A smooth mouthfeel, aside from that longer lingering hop bite, sets the stage for everything to dance around on your tongue.  Despite all the hops, or perhaps because of it, this is a smooth very enjoyable beer to drink. It is a fine foil to their otherwise very balanced IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Jeffo,4.59,"Got this at The Cracked Kettle in Amsterdam.  From a bottle into a snifter.  APPEARANCE: Pours a 1 ½ finger medium white head with good retention. Tawny orange in color, but more gamboge when held to the light. Zero carbonation evident. Head slowly recedes to a decent film with a thick ring. Leaving some immediate lacing. Splotchy film and a ring remains leaving some decent lacing down the glass.  SMELL: Big nose with a touch of pale malts, but it's all about the huge hop presence of pine and grassy hay. Some citrus and grapefruit notes there too, but it's very heavy on the pine. Massive one-dimensional nose.  TASTE: Huge hop bill. Extremely bitter. There's a hint of pale malts there, but never mind that. Overloaded with piney flavored hops and background notes of citrus and bitter grapefruit. A slight bit of melon and caramel offer a decent attempt at some balance through the middle, but they're soon brushed aside by a monster bitter piney hop aftertaste that's really bold and long lasting. The bitterness just lingers and lingers.  PALATE: Medium body with medium carbonation. Somewhat creamy smooth, goes down smooth with no bite and finishes crisp, with an appropriate amount of dryness on the palate. Solid here.  OVERALL: Ruinous, just like it said. There are a lot of beers out there that claim this or that, but this one lives up to its name and then some. Easily the most bitter beer I've ever had, completely frying my palate, and I couldn't wait for more. Stone said they would ruin me, and they did, and for that, I give my thanks. They should also say that if you'd like your palate returned to you, expect about 6-8 weeks delivery time. Recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Pours a hazy golden brownish yellow with a light white head. The nose is punched full of citrus hops and pine. Beautiful! This beer disperses in your mouth and leaves a film of alpha acid and fresh cut pine. If you were planning on drinking any other beers for the night. Forget about it! This beers hop profile dominates most in not all others so be sure to drink last. Big nose, Huge body, and a ridiculous amount of hops. Great brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,TCgoalie,4,"Finally getting around to reviewing this tastey drink.  Pours a hazy golden yellow with a hint of red. A touch of big bubble head, but quickly leaves the glass.  Nice caramel malty tone in the scent with plenty of lemon and orange essence. I like the citrus smell.  Plenty of malt up front that quickly develops into piney citrus hops. There are essences of orange peel and spruce tree before the malt balances in the back end.  A relatively full beer for a double IPA, but does not overpower the mouth. There is plenty of bitterness but not in an overpowering way.  I could drink several of these with no objection, but it is a little malt heavy for my taste.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,joeldp144,4.57,"A: Pours a frothy head 1"" in my tall pilsner glass. Cloudy appearence (not transparent), but the color is golden line the sun on a summer morning.  S: The cascade hops come through with a strong citrus fragrance. Grapefruit, mandarin oranges, floral, and a hint of pine. Oh, yeah...they went there.  T: Very smooth for an IPA of this magnitude. Had it side by side with the Stone IPA (standard), and I found this one to be far smoother. Very balanced taste. Very hoppy, but the malt and alcohol counter the punch.  M: Crisp. This beer feels like a 5% beer in your mouth, but then your body starts to warm from the alcohol.  D: For me, I could not drink more than one due to the overall ""size"" of this beer (both hops and alcohol), but it is very balanced.  Overall, this IPA is a great example from Stone, but it greatly surpasses the standard Stone IPA with regard to balance. Regardless of what the label says, it is not that hoppy, so don't be afraid. If you see this beer and are in an IPA mood, I highly recommend it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Piney hops and malts are up front on the nose, with the hops dominating. Lemon, orange, and pineapple filling in the rest. Bitter, piney hops dominate the taste, becoming peppery, with the malts coming in after. Lemon, orange, and some faint pineapple join in on the peppery finish. Mouthfeel is crisp and biting. Medium body--just right for this particular beer. Good drinkability, considering the ABV.

Head lasts a while and forms a slight mound. Head sticks to the sides for a while. Lacing will last the whole beer.  Smells rather fruity with a subdued hoppy scent. Maybe banana? Very pleasent.  Taste is hoppy with a fruity after taste, similar to Fruit Loops. It's a mellow IPA, but the hops are present.  Full bodied flavor, this beer holds nothing back.

147,4083,mike130,4.37,"Pours a cloudy, dark yellow colour. Nice head that leaves a bit of lacing and moderate retention. Looks very much like a rich IPA, and the smell confirms this. Hops, hops, hops come out, in a rather piney way, quite dry if anything. Very little malt presence.  The taste was a tad unpleasant at first - expecting something a bit more balanced, but it does taste outstanding. Concentrated hop-bomb made a tad milder by a middling malt presence, but the most prominent flavor here is undoubtedly hops. Quite piney and dry, not at all like the more citrus-y IPA's I've tried before, but nevertheless a most excellent quick.  The carbonation is basically what you'd expect from this sort of brew - it's carbonated enough to make it easy to drink but not so much that it's overly fizzy. Quite thick, with not as much booze as you'd expect from a ~8% brew - there's simply no room for it in the avalanche of hops. Very drinkable for a beer of it's style - not enough balance to truly be an easy drinker, but very enjoyable nevertheless. An excellent brew from Stone, as would be expected.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,feelmefoam,4.69,"Ruination pours a hazy orange-wheat color with plenty of visible carbonation that appears out of the mist and runs up into head, which is a little over a finger high with a creamy, off-white color and lots of thick foam. Doesn't have great retention (the alcohol content is partly at fault there), but the lacing it leaves is thick, hanging like laced drapes off the side of the glass.  The aroma is almost perfect; the fragrance is room-filling and you certainly don't have to search hard for the individual components of the nose. This thing is dripping with juicy, citrusy hops; I can clearly distinguish some grapefruit and lemon notes as well as a distinct pine aroma. Smells absolutely delicious.  The people at Stone put this together just the way I like 'em- hopped to the hilt. There is a decent amount of pale malts, but they know their place. The light buttery malts stay in the background and eventually fade from the flavor. Hops are the main event here. Up front, through the middle, and in the finish, waves of grapefruit, lemon, and pine sap all mingle together and create an awesome drinking experience.  The mouthfeel adds to the experience as well. The beer has a medium body and together with a mild amount of carbonation and the oiliness of the hops, the mouthfeel is smooth and silky. Although it's 7.7% ABV, I can't detect any alcohol in there.  All in all, this is a very well-put-together beer that I can't put down. I'm pretty much done with it and I've been trying to savor it for the sake of reviewing and enjoying it. Don't get me wrong, I've thoroughly enjoyed it, I just wish I had a lot more of it.

Citrusy and piney; mostly orange/grapefruit up front.  T: Dry, refreshing, and bitter as hell (in a good way).

M: More full-bodied than I would've expected, and leaves a nice oily coating on the tongue, and a very bitter finish leaves you wanting more. Carbonation is just right.  D: Fantastic IPA; definitely lived up to the numerous recommendations from fellow BA's. I think the ABV of 7.7% for this DIPA helps keep everything in check and makes for a very drinkable version of the style.

Citrusy hints, grapefruit and pines are all there. Enjoyable IPA, but be ready for this one, no ordinary Imperial IPA.

147,4083,CharlatanSin,4.09,"Let's take a trip down memory lane. A year ago I was a college lad, starting to develop my beer tastes. I knew what styles and qualities I liked, but didn't know much about particular beers. I saw a bottle of Ruination and was enchanted by the foreboding bottle and description. My erstwhile companion and great BA boatshoes, far more knowledgeable than I, told me it was one of the best in the category. I was expecting an assault from hop heaven. When it was finally time to drink the damn thing, I ended up disappointed. It was okay, but wasn't nearly as bitter as I'd hoped it would be. I felt jilted.  Today I'm a bonafide hophead, with a far more nuanced palate than I had then. I decided it was high time to give the gargoyle another go. Poured from a bomber into an oversized wine glass.  A: The beer pours a very slightly hazy golden color. The pour creates a soapy, oily head that never fully builds but never vanishes. A bit lighter in color than I like in my DIPAs.  S: Smells like hops thrown fresh into the boil kettle. Leafy, almost flowery, with a strong citrus edge. Dank would be a good descriptor. Excellent.  T: Super powerful, deep bitterness dominates. It's hoppy for sure, with grapefruit dominating. But there's also a root-like astringency that you feel deep in your palate. Alcohol comes out as it warms. Not a lot of malt balance to speak of, which isn't a dealbreaker.  M: Honestly, felt a little thin to me. Oily. The beer coats and clings like crazy, which makes you forget about the thinness up front.  D: Liked it way better this time around, but off the top of my head I can still think of a half dozen DIPAs that I like better. Maybe it's the iconoclast buried inside me. In any event, its a DIPA standard reference, and for at least that reason I know I'll be coming back to it again and again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,cratez,4.42,"650ml bottle purchased by my girlfriend at Beer World in Largo, Florida.  Pours a hazy amber hue with one finger of ivory white head and blotches of lace all over the snifter. A good looking beer.  Smell and taste are aromatic pine needles, Clementine peels, white grapefruit, and resinous C hops. Malt profile imparts caramel, molasses cookies, and taffy, which makes me think this might be an old bottle. Aftertaste is pungent and citric with juicy American hops and a sharp, biting bitterness that lingers for quite some time.  Overall, the nose is sweeter than I prefer (similar to a U.S. Amber Ale), but this is a solid drinker with some nice fruity-resiny notes and a beautifully bitter finish. Stone delivers once again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mklinger,4.22,"Poured into a New Glarus shaker pint glass. The beer pours a deep gold, really very similar in color to the regular Stone IPA -- probably the palest DIPA I've had. The beer looks thicks, more viscous than the regular Stone IPA. It also pours substantially more hazy -- couldn't see much through this one. Nice head formed with fantastic lacing left behind with each sip.  Smell is all pine and citrus hop. I didn't pick up on any alcohol scents as some others have. A faint whiff of bready malt, but mostly just a good amount of citrus and pine hops -- not a crazy level of hops. Very similar aroma to the regular Stone IPA.  While the aroma wasn't that different, taste is like Stone IPA on steroids. Some good floral, citrus, and piney hops hit you first, followed by the 1-2 blow of strong bready malt and potent, long-lasting bitterness. The bitterness here really is the defining characteristic. Literally an hour and a half after finishing this beer, I could still taste the hop bitterness. Ruination, indeed!  Mouthfeel was appropriately slightly thicker than a regular IPA but not cloying as a barleywine. Nice carbonation. Easy to drink beer, though I'm not sure I'd want a second one on the same night & I'm not sure I'd be able to taste anything less assertive afterwards, but it sure went down easily.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Hop flavor is not so much of the sticky, piney, floral type, but more of the true bitter, earthy and dry. Man, the aftertaste is bitter. No real malt profile or character to speak of. Very nice.  M: Carbonation approporiate for the style, if not a little light. Not heavy. Can't really say creamy, but smooth.  D: good, intense version of the style.

Hop-a-saurus aroma, witha syrupy pine and honey side, with some malt to balance out the aromatics. Piney hops fill the mouth, and the receptacle appreciates, bitter as all get out. Bready and sweet bread. Great! My palate hath been ruined due to the massive hopping! Long bitter finish. Greg , you brew good beer! Thanks!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,klkatz,4.73,"100 IBUs - do I even need to continue?  Stone Cold lock for the best IPA I've had in a while.  Amber color - great mouth feel, excellent bitterness.  The beer is a celebration of hoppiness - they claim to ruin anything that you try to taste after drinking this as it will pale in comparison.  excellent beer for those that like bitterness, IPA, etc...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,asabreed,4.4,"Bomber into a Samuel Smith 12 oz. nonic.  Appearance: The funniest thing about Stone is that this brew, aside from the monster head and frothy lacing, doesn't stray too far, if you're talking about the sheer look of the body of the brew, from a BMC brew, and it almost has less carbonation. Something to mention. As said, though, the lacing climbs the glass, and the head never lets the body dominate the look in the glass.  Smell: Raw, earthy, and leafy hops, dominated by rind and citrus. Clean, balanced, pungent, and effervescent, with a bit of sweetness on the nose too, along with the floral underlying bouquet.  Taste: Awesomely balanced with leafy hops, pungent citrus, and sharp fruit esters. Lingering earthy hops, finishing with grapefruit rind. Even though everyone tries to outdo the 100+ IBUs, this is still one of the best balanced brews out there for everyting that it brings to the table.  Mouthfeel: The weirdness of the body, as far as the seemingly lackluster carbonation look, makes this seem like it's out of the bizarro world. Creamy, silky, and altogether smooth. The best thing about this brew.  Drinkability: One of the pioneers, and one that still delivers. Couldn't believe I didn't have a review for this. Not only does it hold up, but it's still a staple. Always something to get in a bomber if available. At least for me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,sophisticated,4.4,"Thanks JosephLondon!  Ooooh boy. This is a delight. The bottle is entertainment in itself - explaining that it's called ""Ruination"" cuz this will ruin your palate due to the 100 IBUs and crazy ammount of hops. Bring it on!  Appearance is LOVELY. Poured it into a Sam Adams ""perfect pint"" glass. Big 2 fingers of sudsy off-white head. Mostly clear orange-amber, left plenty o' lace.  Open the bottle, and a whiff of hoppy goodness! Mostly sweet citrus and fine florals.  This beverage tastes strongly of hops - citrus, florals, and pines in yo' face. I also got some mild malts, sweet vanilla, and earthy notes. As it warmed the bitterness came out, but not unpleasantly, against delicious orange and lemon notes.  Mouthfeel is very smooth, medium-bodied, slightly oily, and leaves a delicious (bitter) hops residue behind.  Drinkability: I'd love many of these! But 1 22 oz. bottle is plenty, especially with 7.7% ABV. The alcohol is not noticeable in taste. But the brew is delicious and pleasurable. I don't know that my palate is ""ruined,"" more like ""delighted."" Yes!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,climax,4.35,"Ruination poured a golden amber  The nose was an attack of hops, but not a brutal assault. The profile and complexity of it was good, but the strength of the smell was not as potent or ruinous as I was expecting. A potpourri of floral marijuana, straight soap, and grapefruit. As I stuck my nose in further the malt backbone began to come out. Alcohols, toffee, and crispy biscuits kept any sort of balance more as it warmed.  The flavor is excellent, almost like a double IPA with seemingly less soapiness. Mouthwatering citrus, pine resin, grass, sour apple candy, bubblegum, and biscuits and caramel towards the end.  The body was nice and robust with very crisp carbonation. The feel was slimy and chewy, real nice.  It has to be sipped, but the dry finish has a mouthwatering effect that begged rudely for another sip. I can't say it ruined my pallet but it handed out a few good shots to the jaw. Awesome beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,MrHassellYaHurd,4.57,"This review comes with much anticipation on my part!  22oz bottle poured into a pint glass.  Pours a light orange/copper color. Crystal clear with a billowy eggshell toned head clinging to the glass.  Scents of sweet malts, piney and citrusy hops, and a heavy fruit aroma form the powerful nose of this brew.  Sweet god of the Humulus lupulus! Thick grapefruity hop syrup goodness is like drinking pine sap. This is a good thing for the hopheads out there. Sweet malty taste with a slightly roasted biscuit taste and an appropriate level of carbonation.  Full-bodied, but not unbearable. To the contrary, this is a very drinkable big-beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,HURTemHIZZY,4.54,"Awesome brew, one of my staples.  Pours a nice bright amber color with a 3 finger off white head. Head dissipates a bit faster than I would have liked, but leaves some nice lacing down the glass.  Smells like hops. pure hops. Awesomeness. Great amounts of pine citrus, and floral notes with just the faintest hint of a sweet malt backbone. Such a great smelling brew.  Taste is also awesome, and follows in the same manner as the aroma. I love the earthy notes in here, they are a bit stronger than the citrus from the hops but the citrus is absolutely present. A bit a an oily character from the hops, not unpleasant at all. Love this beer, wish I could get it for a bit cheaper than the $17 a six pack I bought it for today. I guess that's what two hearted is for.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,vette2006c5r,4.35,"Stone IPA poured a very rich golden color, with a perfect head. It had a very strong hoppy smell to it. The taste was very strong, very very hopy. It had a very good taste, but it due to the extreme hopiness it leaves a very strong aftertaste, that may be a little harsh.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,Kinsman,4.52,"Pours a wonderful dark amber/orange color. Off-white head sits atop nicely with about 1 finger thickness. Head retention was lacking a bit but I didn't mind that too much as it left me with a nice sticky lace.  Smell... what is their to say about such a wonderful scent? One quick whiff before I even poured the bottle told me I was in for a treat. Of course, being a D.I.P.A. it is most notably hoppy. More specifically the hops provide grassy and piney aromas and a bit of a lingering citrus scent. Other aromas appear to be present but a hard to decipher from everything else.  This being a D.I.P.A., taste is obviously heavy on the hops, but not nearly as harsh or unbalanced as others in the style can be. In fact an initial bready malt can be detected before the hops take your palate hostage. From there on out it is grassy and floraly hop flavors. Bitterness however is not as bad one would expect, perhaps from all the malt needed to reach the ABV.  Quite a full body feel in the mouth and certainly warming from all the alcohol. Leaves you just wanting more and more however with all the ""ruinous effects"" on your palate, maybe one is enough.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BeerNemesis,4.39,"Stone Ruination IPA. 22oz. bomber. 2010.  Appearance: Cloudy, pale yellow with a frothy white head. Anemic head retention was a minor disappointment.  Aroma: Sweet hop oils with a round burst of citrus. Some malt fruitiness.  Taste: Immediate malt flavors are followed by a prolonged flow of intricate hops. Floral hops are mixed with citrusy and piney flavors. Some earthy tones in the background. Finishes semi-dry.  Mouthfeel & Drinkability: Perfect level of carbonation for an IPA. Creamy mouthfeel. The hops abound, but work well for me. It's has a bit of a pucker-inducing finish, but the aftertaste is enjoyable even though bitter.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,zoso493,4.29,"Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a Ruination straight-sided pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a deep, semi-hazy honey-amber color that lights up with honey overtones when held up to the light. Has a smallish two-finger, foamy head that has decent retention and leaves some very sticky lacing on the side of the glass.  Smell: You don't have to try too hard to get a whiff of this one, and I could probably review the scent just fine with it sitting next to my computer. Immediately you know this is going to be a West Coast hop bomb. This just has a huge scent of floral, piney, resinous and citrusy hops that is wonderfully complex and bold without being too overpowering. There are also some traces of sweet malts to be found somewhere behind the enormously diverse plume of hop smells.  Taste: A very smooth DIPA. It starts with a bittering hop sensation before moving onto the citric and primarily grapefruit hop profiles. This one is certainly a hop bomb but the presence of an undercurrent of malts is also detectable and refreshing. For me, though, the taste is not so beautifully woven together as the scent, and I fear this may be because of the age of the bottle I have (it's almost about to be out of date). Nevertheless, if you're a hop head (I am), you will be glad you tried this beer.  Mouthfeel: This is almost as good as a mouthfeel as you will find in a DIPA. It's very thick for the style and nicely carbonated to prevent any cloying from the copious amounts of hops. The bitterness from all the hops lingers around for awhile, maybe a touch too long, but I bet if you had this with a spicy meal, it would be the perfect complement.  Drinkability: This is a pretty drinkable DIPA at only 7.7% ABV, but with the huge hope profile, I think I'll just stick to this one bomber. That's not a knock on the drinkability either, as this is a smooth beer that goes down easily.  Overall, this is a very nice DIPA that goes overboard on the hops, in a good way. If you are a hop head like me, you need to try this beer. The hops might be a bit overpowering in the scent and not as intricately linked as perhaps I would like to see, but again, this may be different with fresher bottles. All in all, though, this is a really interesting and powerful example of the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,kalkavekkian,4.03,"Poured out of a 22 into a weizen glass. Color was a golden orange similar to hopslam with a nice soft white head and sticky, lingering lacing. Smell was a very sweet, floral - hops combo pleasing to the senses. Great, tangy orangeish taste with a nice bite to the tongue and palate. Taste stayed with me a good bit. mouthfeel was medium to light. Drinkability was good and enjoyable to the point where i would be comfortable with these all night. Then again, i am a strong hop, dipa lover, so take that into consideration. In other words, this beers got a bite to it but not an overload to the tastebuds. Highly recommended and surprisingly available.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,kifn2,4.13,"a - golden with a minor amount of cloudiness. the head is white and retains well.  s - floral and pine hop aromas. no apparent malty smells.  t - high hop bitterness, which is a characteristic of the style. for lack of a better word, the ""maltiness"" is not apparent to me at all. the hop profile seems to be of an american character. citrus and pine flavors dominate. the bitterness persists on the tongue. appropriate for the style.  m - slight acidity and moderately carbonated. there is some hop derived astringency, which is the one area in which this beer digresses from the style. i cannot detect much alcohol warming at all.  d - yes i can drink it. can i start a petition to eliminate this category, please?",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,SDHoffers,4.52,I generally tell newcomers to this beer that if you are gonna have more than one type of beer you may want to save this one for last. This is an explosion of hop! A real pallet smasher. The hop really sits on your tongue for a significant period and you probably won't taste much of anything else for a while. Appearance is golden but not necessarily transparent. Smell is where this beer gets me. The floral notes of pine and citrus are great. Initial hit almost makes my eyes water. Mouthfeel is good and not too thin. Drinkability can be a slow process so take your time with this one.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,PeprSprYoFace,4.47,"Another beer I have had several times but never reviewed it for some reason. If you have a chance to try this double dry hopped on cask at the brewery, and you like cask beer, i would jump on that opportunity. This is the IPA that got me into IPA's. I didn't like them untill I had this one so it's special to me.  Pours a beautiful golden color and more on the clear side of hazy. I have seen way hazier IPA's, especially double ones, and this one is more toward clear. Very nice head but it could be bigger. The lacing is awesome though.  Smells great. The smell of a fresh IPA is the best. Tons of citrus and pine and a little bit of pineapple and peach or mango.  Taste is a tongue buckler but the hop flavor is great too. It's a little more on the piney side of the hop flavor. Maybe that says slot about the flavor addition.  Mouthfeel is great for this style. Great carb and viscosity.  Overall I will drink this many times, especially in a fresh cask. And I can for sure finish a whole bomber by myself.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ocmpoma,3.97,"A- poured out a deep copper-gold. No head, but a thin film that persists throughout the drinking session.  S- ah, Ruination! Bitterness overwhelms just about anything else in the aroma -- in a good way. I do get some IPA citrus notes, but it's almost entirely a zesty tang on the nose.  T- same on the palate. Zest and bitterness all up front, down the middle, and in the back. It's phenomenal. IPA citrus and even some hints of sawdust are there, but the hops and bitter tongue-pucker are dominant. Not one-sided, though, or unbalanced. It's a great, lasting flavor that has plenty of complexity.  M- light and quite carbonated, which helps to balance the taste.  D- For me, a beer with average drinkability. One is definitely enough to satisfy any jonesing for hops that I might be experiencing.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,MikeGill,4.1,1 pint 6oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass.  Light clear orange. Receding frothy head with web-like lacing. Very herbal woody aroma with traces of tobacco.  Aggressive bitterness (100+ IBU's) but not overwhelming. A shock to the senses at first but mellows nicely. Pine and grapefruit flavors with a little bit of cinnamon. Subtle malt sweetness and lingering hop spice with lemon peel and white pepper on the finish. Unctuous mouthfeel.  An intense yet well balanced beer.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,darthmiles,4.38,"Served in a tulip glass at Track 84 in Warwick, RI. Has a nice deep amber cloudiness under a slightly off-white head. The look certainly precluded the big taste that was to come. Nice aroma of mostly hops and some hints of fruit. Since this is a Stone we expect plenty of California hoppy goodness to be present and this brew doesn't disappoint. Lots of flavor here but certainly not overdone as one might expect from a Stone DIPA. Even though this beer is all about hops it's not overwhelming, you can still taste the malts and the finish has a nice bitterness. This is a great beer to have with a big rare steak, don't bother with the veggies as you'll get enough greens from your beverage. Highly recommended with just a few peanuts as well if you're lucky enough for your local watering hole to carry this gem.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,eat,3.99,"Split this bottle with a friend at Volo's Stone release. Pours slightly cloudy and honey coloured. Hazy cover of white head, bits of lace.  If hops were made into a really tasty hop candy, they would smell like this. Candied citrus and pineapple, sweet malt and flowers. Awesome.  Pine, cat-piss hops, floral, subtle, light malt background. This isn't balanced but I don't think it's meant to be. Hops are definitely featured here.  Good feel. Viscous medium body with a mild carbonation.  In spite of tasting pretty great, this is too intense to drink much of. I do love IPA but there are just so much hops here that it would literally make me sick to drink three of these. I don't think I'd even want to drink more than one at a time. I would not say this is sessionable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Smell is great. Hops... obviously, strong citrus and essentially reminds me of harvesting my own Zeus and Cascades in the backyard...just take a handfull of both and stick a nose in there...same for this beer. Taste is exactly the same for me...it's got the same bite and bitterness as I've gotten from my own hops, some high AA's and good citrus to balance. Mouthfeel is ok..it's a pretty strong DIPA...not so much in the ABV department but certainly IBU's are up there. It's not something I'd call sessionable...it would certainly be tough for anything to follow this without having a big cleansing of the palate.

147,4083,Lldeegan,4.11,"Pours a light, burnt orange, very clear. The beautiful amber-orange gives it an amazing radiant quality, looks delicious and refreshing. The beer is topped off by a stark white, frothy head that leaves a consistent sticky lacing. There is a hint of grain and malt in the nose with citrus and a resin-like hop aromas. Notes of grapefruit, some bread and herbal, green pine. Subtle sweet malt up front on the palate which immediately rolls back into a citrus grapefruit followed by a bitter and lingering pine finish. It is a very clean, crisp and refreshing beer. More balanced than I remember it was when I got it on draft at The Avenue. The bitterness is not overwhelming but might be for some, so don't make this your first IPA. My opinion is that this beer is best enjoyed on a hot afternoon for that much anticipated first beer of the evening. Also great for the beach, on a deck or patio watching the sun set to match the color of this gorgeous beer, especially since it will go great with chips and salsa.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Sweet citrus, mostly orange, allspice, pine sap, and bitter hops.  Really well balanced considering it's advertised with 100+ IBUs. Very bitter grapefruit and orange flavors from the Centennial hops, some caramel malt coming through, a little depth from white pepper like flavors, and a very clean cedar like bitter finish. Not much to not like.  Plenty of carbonation combined with the clean Columbus hop finish isn't hard to not want more of. At 7.7, you probably won't ask for a second glass, but the first one will be making you want another.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BuckyFresh,4.52,"Appearance: Poured from a 12oz bottle into a large wine glass. Beer is fairly clear and golden in color. The head is pretty moderate in size (about 1 finger) dissipates pretty rapidly. Not a whole lot of lacing to speak of, but some large bubbles are left after the head dissipates.  Smell: Great hop aroma with citrus and malt notes shining through. Maybe a touch of pine and some yeast as well.  Taste: The first thing that stands out to me is how well balanced this beer is. I'm used to immediately getting a face full of hops with DIPAs, but with this one the bitterness kind of sneaks up on you. For me, the first detectable flavor was a creamy, malty warmth; but that doesn't last for long, as the hoppy bitterness eventually makes its way to the forefront. There is a bread-like quality that balances things throughout, and a clean, dry finish that doesn't leave you with a face-puckering bitter sensation. There is a nice toasted character that is sometimes lacking in beers of this variety and a warming sensation from the high ABV that makes the taste of this brew top-notch.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, creamy, and very refreshing. Carbonation is just right and the beer is surprisingly smooth given the 100+ IBU's as indicated on the bottle.  Drinkability: As far as DIPAs go, this one is really drinkable. It's smooth flavor and clean finish make this a beer that could go the distance.  I really loved this beer and would definitely recommend it. It gives you a big dose of hops without beating you over the head with it!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,goldbot,4.1,"12 oz bottle. Tasted on 1/24/10 I can't read the ""Best by"" date on the bottle well. It is either 1/24/10 (meaning this beer technically expires today) or 11/24/10. Hopefully the latter.  Pours very orange with ample off-white head. Good head retention and lots of lacing as expected. Nice streams of carbonation bubble up through the beer.  Lots of grapefruit and pine notes in the aroma. Not too in-your-face, a bit subtle compared to other DIPAs. Hints of nut and a touch of bready malt round out the smell.  I still can't be sure if this is too old or not. The hops were there in the aroma, but they definitely seem faded here. There is not much of the citrus or floral character in the taste. However there is still a bit of pine and a strong bitterness present. Some malt comes through but this is somewhat subtle as well. It also retains some planty characteristics of the hops, which remain on the tongue after the finish along with plenty of bitterness.  A nice medium, not overpowering body. A good drinkable beer still. I expect fresher there would have been more citrus or pine hoppy flavor, but the planty bitterness is still excellent. Also the malts, while subtle, balance the hops well.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Kitt,4.65,"Pours about a half finger head with weak lace that persists. Head dissipates rapidly. Appearance a dense, rich, but relatively light amber -- almost a rosin color.  Aroma of stark bitter hops and malt with a hint of grapefruit.  Taste pure bitter hops in the foreground with heavy lingering on the rear pallette. A sweet malty straw flavor -- reminiscent of a recently cut spring field -- provides a strong background and is touched with a hint of pine. Any former grapefruit has long since been banished: no citrus taste prevalent here! The bitter hops linger marvelously but are not overwhelming...they certainly leave one wanting!  mouthfeel is excellent. Pure, crisp, fluid with little viscosity -- perfectly synergized with the lively and lingering hops.  Drinkability -- nothing short of fantastic. The bitter hops provides a wanting desire for more and that desire is immediatlely quenched only to ressurrect itself moments later. A deadly cycle!  This is a superb IPA -- rich, strong, well developed. A strong hop flavor that is synergized with mouthfeel perfectly. A banquet IPA for the most serious among us. Worth the price.

147,4083,bosox941827,4.44,"Served (quite cold) from a 22 oz bottle into an imperial pint glass....will taste it as it warms.  Is it weird to almost be *afraid* of a beer before trying it? I consider myself to be a dyed-in-the-wool hophead, but I am somewhat anxious before my first taste of this one...some of the reviews reassure me, but others, including the one directly below mine, add to that anxiety. In any case, here goes...  A - Orange-y,-amber, a bit of a chill haze, with not much of a head; what there is dissipates quickly - ""soap"" and oil, you know? S - WOW! What do you expect? Piney, citrusy, SOAPY hops. Gotta say - and still haven't tasted it - it's one of the best beers I've ever smelled - just fantastic.... T - So, still quite cold, but the fact that some malt punches thru the 100 IBUs is amazing - but it does. Of course, what is most obvious are the hops - they're everywhere, but this is a quite drinkable beer, even at 7.7% ABV (which you can't taste at all - 22 oz of this will be fun!). What was I afraid of? Goes like this: hops at the front, transition to slightly sweet w/roasted malt character, which lingers as it goes back to hops. M - Slightly carbonated and fairly smooth...this will cut through any food you want to throw at it, guaranteed. D - Surprisingly drinkable, but as I said - the hoppier the better for me.  Gotta say - I thought this was a ""show-off"" beer - 100 IBUs!! But it is also a ""real"" beer that, though not for the faint of heart, is also quite good. Will *definitely* get this again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Kelp,1.91,"Pours out a a golden orange color with a nice white head a finger high. Dissipates slowly and ok lacing to the beer.  Smells of piney hops. Then you get the cirtusy smells and a slight finish of hops.  I feel like I am drinking Pine-sol and bitters. All i can get is a strong pine flavor followed by a disgusting bitter flavor. Then grapefruit on my tongue that I just can't get rid of. This is one of the few times I poured the last of my beer down the drain. It is vile to me, unfortunately i just cant go from pine to bitter to grapefruit. This just isn't my type of brew.  Has an oil and water feel in my mouth. The bitterness that follows takes away any thought after that.  I would never buy this. I probably will never try a fourth time. I have tried to drink this beer a few times as my palate has progressed and each time is as bad to me as it was before. This beer is just not for me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Crazy4LegMoose,4.17,"A: Hazy light copper/amber colored ale w/ 2 fingers of off white creamy head that leaves decent lacing  S: Strong aroma of citrus and pine hops.  T: Rich citrus and pine hop combination that dominate the flavor of this brew. This beer features a slightly buttery malt, yet clean finish.  M: Medium mouthfeel. Creamy carbonation that mixes the hop flavors and transitions nicely into the clean malt finish.  D: Very good drinkability.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,WYVYRN527,4.77,"I'm suprised I never sat down and reviewd this one before. Poured from a 12-ounce bottle.  A: Golden in color, very slight haze with a thick white head that slowly settles. Carbonation is fine, and lacing is good as well.  S: Smells like the west coast. Citrusy, with hints of pine and floral meadow, with a nice malty, caramel-like backbone.  T: Like the smell, but backwards. The sweet caramel notes from the malt are present, but soon engulfed with a torrent of grapefruit, lemon zest, pine, and flowers. Finish is dry, and sweet at the same time, and dances around the palate for some time.  M: Medium-bodied, and viscous. The amount of malt and resinous hops coat the palate and mingle quite nicely.  D: One of the most consumable beers of this style I have ever tasted. If it were a little less expensive, I could drink this beer every day.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,MbpBugeye,4.1,"A- Clear amber, but this is the first glass from a bomber so I might see some haze on the next glass. The head is large, sticky and eggshell white. It leaves lacing all over the place and has good retention.  S- Strong bouquet of citrusy and piney hop oils. There is a biscuity and toasty malt bill underneath to give this a pretty nice and complex nose.  T- Sweet then bitter then sweet then bitter. Back and forth it goes. It starts very candy-like citrusy sweet, then it breaks to a very very piney hop presence and finishes a bit toasty. The end result is lots of hop oils leaving a bitter aftertaste. There is a strange sappy taste towards the finish that is somewhat off putting.  M- Soft, smooth and refreshing. Average carbonation.  D- Barely noticeable abv and a nice crisp and refreshing brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,KTCamm,3.43,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  Pours cloudy orange translucent with receding white foam. Leaves some islands of foam floating in the top.  Grassy pine smell, some malt.  Firm hop taste that builds over time. Bitter throughout and lasting long into the aftertaste. Grapefruit notes.  Very powerful in the mouthfeel. I'm no hop head, but this was much mellower than I would have expected - it wasn't mellow by any means, but didn't kick my ass.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Pours a crystal clear deep golden bordering on copper color with good two finger tightly bubbled white head that recedes slowly lacing my entire glass. Smells of pine and resinin mostly. Caramel brown sugar and a touch of alcohol deep within the aroma. Taste is pine and herbal and bitter. Barely enough caramel malt to soften the bitter blow from the hops. Finishes with a long lingering hop blast and a bit of warming alcohol. Sticky resinous mouthfeel, medium body and level of carbonation. I've had this many times and just got around to reviewing it now. This is a great go to beer when I need a blast of hops.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Tdizzle,4.37,"Bottled on January 7th, 2010. This is one of several Stone brews that sparked my interest in craft beer, so I figured it's time for a review.  A- Ruination IPA pours a clear dark-gold color with an off-white head of sticky foam that has great retention, displaying some nice webs of lacing all along the inside of the glass. The head settles to a thick cap that sticks around for the duration of my review.  S- Tons of piney, floral hop aromas that are crisp and clean rather than sticky and resinous. There's a hearty base of cracker-like malts present and the aroma has a spicy character to it that resembles lager yeast.  T- The flavors of this beer come in waves: A deeply piney bitterness leads to a slightly herbal character that hits right before the malts kick in to even things out-- sort of. The malt backing tastes similar to grainy bread and provides a nice balance to the flavor before being overtaken by a deliciously bitter and fairly dry finish that lays on the palate for about a minute after each sip. Again, there's a lagerish quality to the yeast (or maybe it's pilsner malt) that gives the flavor a grassy and spicy note that reminds me of Victory's Hop Wallop.  M- A very full-bodied and lightly oily feel with a satisfying amount of carbonation that provides the right amount of pop to the beer.  D- This is closer to a single IPA given the 7.7% ABV, but the flavor and aroma are packed with hops. A great IPA from Stone Brewing Co.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Wisconsinality,3.67,"Poured from 22 oz bomber into standard pint.  A- Pours a very transparent golden straw color with about a finger and half's worth of head that leaves a nice cap on the beer and a little bit of lacing.  S- A strong scent of citrusy hops with a good bit of piney resin. You can also pick up a little bit of the sweet malt in the background and maybe even some white bread.  T- Good piney hops. You can detect a hint of the sweet malt at the tail end to go along with some breadiness from the yeast.  M- A medium bodied brew that has a pretty good bite to it, pretty standard for the style. The carbonation is good and takes away from the bite just a tad.  D- Like it says on the bottle, this will pretty much ruin your palate after one of these and I think that is pretty much spot on. A good beer to sip on but don't expect to have much else after words.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ToasterChef,4.52,"Reviewed form my notes. This beer is nearly translucent with a dark straw color. It has a thick white foam head. The aroma is full of great earth hops. It smells like there may be some yeast aromas present, but it's just as likely I'm just smelling the complex hops and confusing the two. A bit of sweetness appears initially when you taste. This is followed by hearty, grassy hops. The beer finishes with a very bitter hop flavor. Is there a better tasting DIPA out there? Possibly, but I haven't had it. The body feels a bit heavier than what I call medium. There is a lot of tickling carbonation and decent mouthcoating. This is a very hoppy, strong beer. It's hard to drink a lot of these in a row, but individually it goes down very well. Plus, DIPA's aren't meant for chugging, but savoring.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jeffthecheff,3.93,"Best before tomorrow's date printed on the label. Close call here.  Poured a brilliant pale color with slight haze into my shaped pint. The head is just a solid cap of foam with good lacing.  The aroma is of course hoppy, but I'm guessing it would be stronger a few months earlier. It has some good tropical fruit notes as well as some apricot, but it could use more strength. Maybe I'm desensitized after trying the double dry hopped version of this beer. Crackery bread scent from the malt also combines with a touch of the presence of alcohol.  The taste is as bitter as can be with a huge finish. There are some good light citrus notes that come through from the hops but they are a bit to delicate to stand up to the bitter finish. Some of the crackery malt and alcohol combo comes back again. The mouthfeel is full as you would expect from a beer this big, but finishes very dry with a cringing bitterness. Carbonation is right where you want it, lightening the beer a bit while carrying the aromas.  This was an enjoyable beer. The alcohol wasn't too strong, but it carried a good buzz factor. I loved the story on the bottle, it really sums up why we love hops. Thanks for the date code, I wouldn't buy this beer without it. +.5 on drinkability score for that info.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Jwale73,4,"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint. Enjoy by 11/09/09 barely visible at the base of the bottle (guess it's past its prime). Poured a slightly hazy orange-gold with a frothy, bright white half inch head. Head eventually settles into a fairly consistent skim of a cap, with delicate strands of lacing around the perimeter of the glass. Nicely balanced nose - some sweet citrus and some aromatic bittering hops. Taste consistent with nose - hops character seems a bit diminished; however, its still pretty tasty. Finish is slightly medicinal and lightly lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an assertive carbonation level and some acidity that stimulates the cheeks. Pretty solid IPA - I'll have to re-evaluate on a fresh bottle; however, the fact that this has stood up so well past its expiration date is a testament to the quality of the brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Malts so come through though.  Taste: Starts delightful with oily, piney hops and some malt to balance it out. While the first few sips seem coarsely, overbitter, the bitterness becomes less and less during the course of drinking the beer and it turns into an incredibly delicious, but intense, well balanced beer. Quite oily, not so subtle alcohol, citrus peel and pine blend with , though the finish remains bitter. Viscous mouthfeel.  Notes: An excellent double IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,MrDanno96,4.57,"100th review, woo-hoo! Went out to McGregor's tonight and this seemed like a fitting beer for the occasion.  A: Pours a surprisingly clear golden color with a bout a finger of creamy white head. Lots of sticky lacing down the sides of the glass.  S: A nice floral aroma mixed with what I can tell are going to be aggressive hops. Grapefruit and pine can also be identified.  T: Sweet tropical fruits blend quickly into a devastatingly sharp dose of hops. The finish is pretty bitter, but somehow not unpleasant. Great complexity and balance is achieved here between the bitter and sweet fruitiness. Very nice!  M: A light to medium body that provides a sharp bite of carbonation in the finish. Pretty crisp and refreshing overall.  D: One hell of a DIPA. It's not quite Pliney, but it's pretty damn close. I think Ruination on draft might be better than Pliney in the bottle by just a hair.

The Ruination pours an opaque copper color with lots of carbonation and haziness to the pour. Nice frothy head with plenty of lacing. Smells of citrus, pine, and hops. Aroma's are not overpowering in any way but very pleasant. Taste is surprisingly smooth and crisp. I was expecting the bitterness to be overpowering the other flavors, but this isn't the case at all. The taste is mostly sweet citrus fruits. Mouthfeel is fairly light bodied. Although this beer will not ""ruin"" my palate like the label depicts, regardless it is a tasty beer.

147,4083,dougofthefuture,4.19,"Another CA beer while I'm in the state. I sure do love all these hops... No bottled date here. I'm not taking points for this, but it's annoying. The bottle was purchased cold, but who knows where it's been?  A - Soapy two finger head on a light amber body. Very little lacing.  S - Very malty. (Just kidding.) Intense pine and citrus hops are filling the room. More sharp pine than sweet citrus.  T & M - I'm actually finding this very approachable and balanced for what it is. It's definitely hop-forward, but not in an in-your-face way. Light body, medium carbonation, and fairly well hidden ABV make this an enjoyably refreshing beer.

147,4083,3rdRowTailgater,4.57,"Pours a nice clear golden color with a nice amount of head and good lacing.  It smells like you just shoved a hop cone up your nose. Beautiful, bitter, bold, delicious smell. If they had air fresheners with this smell I would buy a case.  Wonderful piney hop bitterness with this beer. The bitterness attacks your mouth and hangs around for a good while.  Could I sit and drink a few of these? Probably not a lot, but is that a bad thing? Hell no.  A strong score for a strong beer.

Attractive but not exceptional.  Ridiculous smell to it, my friend here says ""it's like shoving a hop cone up your nose."" and I agree. Just what an IPA should smell like.  The taste is hop bitterness up fronts with pine flavors. The bitterness lingers magnificently over a slight malty aftertaste. I love the thicker body to this one, it's like you can chew through the hops to get to that slight malt flavor underneath.

Very fresh smelling and definitely elicits a salivary response.  Intense pine with a deep, resinous bitterness that takes your taste buds for a ride and doesn't drive the speed limit. Sweet biscuit malt, very light caramel, some acidic character but undeniably delicious. Harsh and palate scraping but in the best way possible.

The body is a golden yellow color with amber hues...crystal clear.  Lots of hops come through in the nose. Other aromas are citrus, pine and malts.  The taste is similar to the nose...hops up front that pretty much continue throughout. You can pick up a little of the malts in the middle before the second wave of hops finish.  Mouth feel is light and pretty thin, slightly astringent with moderate carbonation.  Very drinkable and a great example of the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,donteatpoop,3.45,"A nice clear pale orange color with a cap of thick white-ish foam that retained well throughout the drink, leaving behind a thin but present lacing effect.  The smell is all hops, pine and grapefruit; with an underlying sweet bready malt and yeast notes.  This has a very dry impact on the palate, the hop combination is powerful like a punch to the nose. The dryness is a bit much for me, I would have liked to taste a more balanced malt impact in the brew; the bread my nose was picking up either pulled a disappearing act or was overpowered by the aggressive hops. Not my favorite DIPA, but by no means a poor beer. I much prefer some 90 minute from Dogfish Head.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,diybrun,4.77,"Poured from bomber into pint glass. Thin 1/2 finger head or less with lacing that lasted most of the beer. Hazy-ish Amber hue when held up to light. Lighter than I expected. This smells of hops, hops, and more hops, as any good IPA should. One of the finest moments of drinking a hop bomb is the first whiff you get of it - sometimes while you're still pouring... you just smell flowers, or pine, or whatever, and this beer just screams at you that you had better be ready. God bless beer. Floral and citrus tones, but my nose is stuffed up at the moment. Taste of hops well balanced by barley. Low to moderate carbonation, which I don't especially mind. I'm not usually a huge fan of imperial/high alcohol beers, but this hides its 7+ ABV very, very well. Simply delicious, well balanced, and I wouldn't mind knocking back a couple more (In fact, I wish I could).  Thank you, Stone, for a high quality beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Head retention was decent and the lacing stuck around for the duration.  Time to smell. KABLAM!! From the moment you open the bottle you can smell the hops from across the room. This is a good thing. Its gives me hope for what's to come.  What the hell? Did I just get smacked in the mouth? To say there is some intense hops in this beer would be like saying Usain Bolt is kinda quick. Hops fill the mouth and linger in the taste profile the entire time. I was surprised tht this isn't as one dimensional as the nose would have me believe. There is a really nice malt backbone that gives it a nice spectrum of flavors but make no mistake- Hops are the captain of this cruise. Alcohol is there but stays out of the way. It doesn't want to screw with the hop monster in charge.  The mouthfeel is juicy, almost oily. Its like someone squeezed a hop cone into liquid and made a beer.  If you like hops this could be the be-all-and end-all beer for you. It bitterness is great but this definitely ain't no 6 pack a night beer.

A+++ when you pop that top and pour this one out, the hop aroma is like POW POW POW!!! IN YOUR FACE!!!!  T- AWESOME. However, I typically like my I-IPAs to have a bit more citrusy characteristics to them than this one. This more than likely was flavor hopped with Simcoe or some hop with a piney profile.  M - medium to full bodied I'd say. very nice. Carbonation was fairly moderate which help lend to a slight sweetness.  D - This beer you can drink any way you want. GO FOR IT!!! I have paired this beer with quesadillas, pizza, chips and queso and even beef jerky! However, I typically pair it with something a bit more heavy.

147,4083,BabyBastard,3.85,"Bomber with enjoy by date of 1-13-10. Poured into chalice with virtually non-existent head. Ale looks surprisingly pale as it comes out of the bottle, but has an apple cider appearance once in the glass. Very hazy. Absolutely no lacing to speak of. Oh wait, there might be a slight bit, over there. Smells of great, bitter hops. Not very strong, as you need to stuff your sniffer in the glass to get a good whiff. Though, the whiff is there, once taken, properly, of course. Tastes of nice, bitter hops. Citrus, grapefruit like notes are prevalent. Also has pine type flavors present, though the many flavors are difficult to distinguish. It is very bitter, and I like it. Feels smooth, not overly carbonated. Overall, this is an extremely easy brew to drink, perhaps only if you know what you are getting into, as the hops are intense, even a few days before the ""enjoy by"" date. This brew is recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,generalnotsew,4.06,A: Pretty decent head on this and the color is very much yellow like opaque orange juice. Not your standard DIPA color here.  S: Wow! Sharp in your face hops with heavy citric grapefruit and a very dirty earthy profile. Also smells very tangy of orange juice. How can something smell so fruity and bitter at the same time? Most complex smelling beer I ever stuck my nose in.  T: Wham! Damn those be some bitter hops! I made a beer face for the first time since my first Bud Ice. 2 mins after my first sip I can still taste it on my tongue. Hold it in your mouth awhile and you can taste those fruity notes but swallow it down it ain't nuthin but STRONG bitter hops. Note: These aren't bad things.  M: Perhaps a bit thin and could tone down the carbonation a bit.  D: Good stuff but I don't see anyone being able to take too much of this punishment. It really is a palate wrecker.  I must say this is the first bitter non overly malty DIPA I had in a long while. I don't even know how they classify it as DIPA at only 7.7% abv. Really curious how this will taste as it warms. My guess is the sweet citric notes will have a much bigger play and not beat completlely back down by the hops.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,taxguyjase,4.59,"This IPA is lighter than I expected, almost the color of a hefeweizen. Not as cloudy, obviously as a hefe, but still pretty opaque. Head didn't stick around much, leaving being spotty clouds at the top of the beer and a little filmy residue as you drink the beer. Lovely floral, piney hops that offer enough scent to be inviting without being terribly overwhelming. For being a Stone beer, I really did expect a more robust taste. This brew is surprisingly subtle and blended. The sourness of the hops is blended in with some yeast that really does change the flavor of the beer from what you'd expect out of an average IPA. I think that it brings out a very fleeting moment of hoppy sweetness near the end of each taste.  I have to disagree with the bottle which describes the hops as ""binding and blinding"" that will have a ""ruinous effect on your palate."" While this was a very enjoyable beer, this isn't so blatantly hoppy that I want to cut my tongue out to regain some sembleness of taste. It really didn't taste THAT bitter, especially for being 100+ IBUs. Perhaps I have abused my mouth with so many IPAs that it takes a really REALLY intense hoppy beer to knock me out of my chair. I like that though, as it takes more skill to make a beer so infused with hops, but not so bitter that you can't drink it.  There is definitely smoothness to the beer, with distinct flavor and hops. If you enjoy hops, you'll really enjoy this beer. It's a sneaky bugger, with a 7.7% ABV, so just don't partake in too many of these.  Appearance - 3.5/5.0 - Golden, opaque, minimal head with lots of lacing Smell - 4.5/5.0 - A tastefully blended mix of hops that are obvious but not overpowering Taste - 4.5/5.0 - Smooth, hoppy with bitterness, but not enough to make it tough to drink.

Head retained decently, though a bit more would have been nice.  S-Resiny thickness, also with a piney aspect. Resounding herbal tones.  T-They weren't kidding... this one is bitter. Huge hop bitterness takes control, allowing only the choicest flavors of resin, herbal/perfume, and slight citrus hops through. Biscuity, toasty dry malt character is able to poke through ever-so-slightly. Finshes bitter, herbal.  M-Moderate carbonation level, doesn't interfere with the beer's characteristics. Body is moderately big, bolstered by the thick bitter hoppiness.  D-This is a difficult aspect to rate for this beer. The extreme bitterness makes it a slow sipper, but the quality of the flavor, along with its other general characteristics, makes me want want more and more.

The malt base is barely detectable behind the hop explosion that results from its ingestion. The ballsy, bitter blast right from the start is only overshadowed by the lingering taste on the palate. This truly is one of the strongest IPA's I can remember tasting. It kicks hard quick and will dominate your palate, leaving you begging for more.  Drinking more than three of these in a row can likely only be done by the most obsessive hops lovers. So if you are in this category, this is your IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,rwrk42,4.65,"Appearance: Golden color that has a nice froth and lace  Smell: HOPS, HOPS and more Hops. Very nice smell of hops with a slight fruity undertone.  Taste: A great amount of hops at first taste. Incredible character of hops but very smooth at the same time. A bit of a bitter finish from all the hops but it is just perfect.  One of the best Im perials IPAs you can buy. Highly recommend.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,kbeals,4.23,"A- 12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass reveals an exceptionally clear light amber colored brew. One finger of white, frothy head sit atop it, leaving behind multi-tiered lacing.  S- Hops, hops and more hops. Pretty much what I expected. The hops smell mostly flowery with a dash of citrus zest to it.  T- Once again, tons of floral hops. As the beer warms there is an ever so slight hint of a sweet, malty backbone. This never really does show up in the aroma, but it's a nice addition to the taste.  M- Medium-light body, very smooth with good amounts of carbonation. This beer's a good sipper, but it's not so high an ABV (thus, a lack of booziness) that you can't drink a lot of it if you want to.  D- Good, as mentioned in the mouthfeel, there's no real boozy flavor to it, just hops. This allows you to keep drinking this beer.  Is this a top DIPA? Yup. And what makes it so great is that it's easily available to a number of consumers. Another great offering from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,samie85,4.57,"Reviewed from notes. Originally consumed 12/24.  A-Pours a yellow/orange color with a white one finger head.  S-I'm getting pine, floral and grapefruit citrus with this one, and just a little bit of biscuity malt.  T-Follows the nose with piny and grapefruit bitterness. Some biscuity malt helps give it some balance.  M-Pretty smooth with medium body and low carbonation.  D-Really pretty easy drinking. The smoothness of Ruination and the lack of any astringency make this one a winner.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mondegreen,4.59,"12oz. bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance is a cloudy amber/orange color with small head.  Smell and taste are both dominated by hops. It is bitter yet very smooth.

147,4083,BarleyAndMe,4.62,"A - Dark golden and cloudy. Nice, and maybe I'm biased towards darker beers, but was expecting something a tad richer in color.  S - A nice citrusy aroma, especially grapefruit. Maybe some hints pear and pineapple, too. Oh, and the bitter hops do give off a nice aroma.  T - Wow. Simply amazing - there's almost a delicateness to its boldness. Nice and hoppy , yet oh so smooth.  M - I am biased towards the bitter, but the hoppiness is wonderfully smooth and bitter on the tongue.  D - This is very easy going down. But that ABV and the hops add a slight heaviness that would limit me to no more than 2 at one sitting.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The hops are dominant but somehow not too bitter. The floral notes even act to cover up the considerable alcohol content. This beer is trouble.  Mouth - perfectly carbonated. Crisp and dry. Frames the hops in the aftertaste as if they were onstage in your mouth.  Summary - drink this beer. If you don't particularly like heavily-hopped beers, drink it anyway.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,xybreeder,4.6,"A: Little below average head size, beautiful retention & lacing. Very lively, carbonation looks perfect. Head size was only thing preventing a higher score.  S: Grapefruit, floral, and hops. MMM hops. This bad boy is begging me to START DRINKING! Characteristics are a little light, and that's what prevented a higher score.  T: Geez, the texture is amazing. Grapefruit and hops again dominate the front end of the taste. However the hops aren't making it bitter at all. Also taste pine on the backend. Awesome tasting brew.  M: Very smooth, perfectly carbonated, plain & simple, perfect mouthfeel.  D: Umm, based on AST&M (above), you can see I could drink this all night. Only thing preventing me would be the 7.7%, might be a short night. :)  Cheers Stone, you guys continue to impress me; keep up the good work.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

It looks just like an IPA should and drinks excellently. It tastes amazing. While it does get super bitter like the description promises, it doesn't over-do it, because it matches bitterness with equally powerful flavors.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,therica,4.52,"POWERFUL.  ""100+ IBU's"" says the bottle.  I was having some asthma problems and used my aerosol nebulizer with the albuterol-saline solution with only modest effect. Then I drank a stein of this stuff and it totally opened my lungs! ha ha  A= rich orange with a generous fluffy head leading to clumps of pooling and lacing.  S= SHAZAAM-- a kick in the nose with pine, pine, more pine, a little grapefruit and subtle hints of glorious fruits and quality malts. I feel like I just shoved my whole bag of fresh Nugget hops in my face. It's more potent than PineSol cleaner but of course much more pleasant.  T= West Coast hops in all their glory, pine, some grapefruit and light sweetness although the beer tends on the more dry side of middle. Once your tastebuds recover, you begin to find rich malts underneath, plus some hints of fruits and maybe a dash of honey.  M= light sweetness on the tongue after it recovers from being entirely numbed by the powerful overdose of strong fresh hops.  D= very drinkable for a sampler, maybe the whole 22 ounce bottle if you're a seasoned IPA drinker. A bit too much IBU acid for most stomachs to endure much more than that, although I suppose that if I really hit stride with it and had 2-3 bottles I could go through them in a night's session.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jhtipton,4.6,"Gosh darn, who came up wit this beer. The bottle says it all. Not really a session beer but it complements almost any meal, including breakfast. First tried this at the Navy Club in Seoul Korea in the bottle but it deserves better. No I drink from a wine glass or flute when possible. The IBUs on this baby are high and gosh darn, I love it. If you don't like a hoppy bitter beer then stay away. Just don't think that it is all flavor with no punch, this will put you down and I almost think it has a higher ABV than advertised.  The head laces the wine glass like a nobody's business.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,billab914,4.2,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into my Southern Tier glass. Pours a pale golden color with a thin white covering on top.  Aroma is very citrusy with grapefruit and a little bit of pine and spiciness. Not as intense of an aroma as I expected knowing how strong the taste is but pretty good none the less.  Taste is very intensely hoppy. The citrus and grapefruit hit you up front and then the spiciness and piny hops hit you in the finish along with the intense bitterness. Taste is pretty much what they describe, a hops overload that will ruin the pallet. The taste is different then the other famous west coast IPA's though, Pliney, Sculpin and others seem to have more of a sweet intense citrus flavor while this one has a more resiny piny intense bitterness to it.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good. It's an intense flavor but for a hops lover this would be pretty drinkable despite the abv.  Overall I like this one a lot, it's one of the only highly regarded west coast IPA's we get where I live. Probably not my top rated DIPA but not too far down the list, and different then most of the rest to make it something I seek out occasionally.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ozzyCobblepot,4.33,"A: Just slightly pale, yellow orange color. Very strong, foamy head, good legs. S: Hops galore, noticaeble spice and pine flavors, sweet fruit tone. Someone earlier said it smelled like grapefruit, that seems on. T: Slightly sweet, but that first flavor is quickly forgotten as these hops come through and overload the palette, citrus and spice dominate. All these fruity flavors that i have trouble discerning. M: Full-bodied with a light finish, a bit of the bitterness of the hops lingers on the soft palette. Touches the range of tastes on the tongue, smooth without much carbonation.  Hell of a beer. Complex in terms of the multitude of flavors and the dynamic they create with one another, but with a more simplistic view--this beer is dominated by slightly sweet, American hops that are bold and heavy, but presented in a medium body and without too much flare. A great deal of depth, presented in a straightforward, authentic way. Maybe it's the amount of alcohol. This is an Ernest Hemingway beer if I ever tasted one. And I don't even know what that means.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,deruiz10,4.35,"Growler poured into a pint glass.  A - One and a half-finger white head leaves behind massive lacing. Pour is a very slightly cloudy yellowish orange.  S - Spicy hops, grapefruit, and a slightly sweet pine undertone.  T - Truly palate-ruining spicy hops predominate, but upon closer inspection juniper berries, spicy citrus, and mildly sweet malts form the foundation. The finish is more gentle than I was expecting with a mild hop bitterness lingering.  M - Mild carbonation, but creamier than most IPAs. But it works to keep the hops from feeling too sharp on the tongue.  D - Perhaps the ultimate hop-lovers beer, this baby is named very appropriately. Best to save this one for sipping or for cutting through some seriously spicy salsa (my favorite way to drink it).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Grapefruit, lemon, orange, and some herbs and spices could be noted.  Taste is fairly mellow at first, follow up by a rush of hops and citrus. Not as overly bitter as some other IPAs I've had, but also not nearly as big and strong in terms of ABV.

Nose is primarily citrusy hops.  Taste is pretty powerful resiny and again, citrus. Malt was languishing in the background but let the hops steal the show here. Hoppy dry finish.

Mouthfeel: bitter but not overly so, medium bodied, small carbonation  Drinkability: A nice and solid beer that lets you know hops are king.

It is always great when upon opening beer out of a bottle the surrounding area becomes a hop rich aromatic cloud.  T - You should go get a ruination. The first sip is not necessarily a pleasurable feeling, but it lets you know what type of beer you are getting into. It finishes smooth with more flavors surfacing as the brew warms up.  M - Mouth feel is like a thick red wine, with a bit of initial creaminess followed by a unmistakable dryness I sometimes get with a good cab.  D - For a 7.7 it is very tolerable. I would argue more so on draft but require a couple more eagerly awaited rounds to find out for sure.  Great beer for anytime or occasion, and if you can, a great pairing with grilled lamb or other more pronouced meat.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

A - Redish/Amber Gold, terrific looking creamy tanish white head. About 1/2"" thick and lasts in small ring to the last drop.  S - Wonderful mild spice, grapefruit citrusiy hop aroma. It made my mouth water. It is whispering malt, but screaming hops.  T - Hops, Hops, Hops! Orangy spicy hop flavor that dances all over your tongue. You get the Grapefruit on the back of your tongue as you clear your the sip from your mouth. Then there is a followup of bitterness and slight malt sweetness, last minute.  M - Very nice body, coats the tongue very well. It even covers your cheeks and the back of your throat with hoppy resin. I bit astringent at times though.  D - This is easily, one of the most drinkable IPA's I have enjoyed. I could put back 3 or 4, but your palate would stop appreciating it after the 2nd one.

Lacing throughout.  S: Floral and citrus hop aroma dominates with the slightest whisp of malt  T: Grassy and citric hop bitterness and sweetness is very upfront. Hop bitterness lingers throughout the session filling the entire mouth with wonderful lupulin goodness. As the session progressed a bit more balance emerged with sweet caramel malt character coming through.  M: Smooth, coats the palate with an almost chewy character. The beer is very unbalanced, albeit intended.  D: The overbearing hop character of this beer make it a short session drink for those less inclined to drink the hop-laden beers. Would complement beef and cheese very well.  This was thoroughly enjoyed for this newly anointed hop-head. Would not recommend for the malt-minded brethren.

Light sweet malt in there too a bit.  T: Resiny, piney, grapefruit hop flavor dominates aside from a light malt sweetness up front. Ruinous bitterness lingers on well after finish.  M: Not exceptionally carbonated. Fairly viscous. A bit creamy. A bit acidic.  D: One of the most bitter beers I've ever had.

A: Light Copper color with a good head that leaves a trail of lace and film all the way down the glass. Not a lot of carbonation though.  S: There is an alcohol scent to the nose. Mostly it's made up of hops. There seems to be a strong diactyl scent as well.  T: Strong hops flavor. Which is good because it masks the imperfections of the heavy alcohol flavor as well. Still seems to be conflicting tastes. Not a heavy or bad after taste either, which is a surprise.  M: A full bodied beer that only leaves a medium oil feel behind.

It almost stings the tongue - def designed the ruin the palate.  M - Somewhat thin, again it kinda stings going down.  D - Good, but not the best. I think this is great for a hop head looking for the ""wow"" factor, but this is not a beer you'd want to get a 12 pack of ya know?

Midway through the bottle, the palate gets a little used to it. Wouldn't plan on drinking more than one of these, and yes, I'd drink this beer last if you're trying a few different beers in an evening.  Can be found at the Bistro on tap almost year round it seems. For some reason, the stuff on tap usually tastes a little smoother, less hoppy almost.

Hops! Hops! Along with plenty of carbonation to ensure that they go down easy.

Absolutely scalding piney hops. Dry as hell and bitter too.  (M)- A good carbonation level amidst one of the driest & most hopped beers I may have ever tried. If there are malts in here, I cant tell.  (D)- A good beer, however its rather one dimensional to me: a dry, immense piney hoppiness on the palate.

M: bubbles, bitter back.  D: Great take on a hopheads dream. The bitterness is the main event here, so if that floats your boat rock on.  The grapefruit/cake attempt to balance out the bitters but the taste goes from sweet, to bitter, to sweet, to strong bitter on the end...but as we all know the only solution to that is another drink. Enjoying it more with each sip and has clenched it for me in publicly becoming a Stone fan! Recommend!  NOTE!!: This beer could seriously do with an abv boost, somewhere around 10-12% or even double the current (7.70%). The bitterness turns pretty abrasive when sipped slowly, but with more alcohol, and the necessary sweetening to create such alcohol, would do little to the hops character but turn the overall drink into something comparable to a fine scotch, making the bitterness have a warm, smooth finish and become more tolerable.

I'm not a hophead by any means, and don't drink IPA's very often, but Stone's Arrogant Bastard was quite good and considering that's such a hoppy beer, I thought I'd try their other brews. I'm learning what is so appealing about hopped up beers.  A: Ruination poured with the arrogance of golden perfection into my glass. A massive, white head formed not unlike that of Duvel. Eventually the head died down a bit leaving copious lacing. A sight to behold. I love how Stone Brewing are quite defiant on the back of the bottle. Also shocked to find that this one is over 100 IBU's (International Bittering Units) I used to steer clear of these types when beer hunting. But no longer.  S: Moderate hops and herbal aromas struck my nose with defiance. It was almost overwhelming.  T: Intense hop bitterness with floral and herbal notes. Slight sweetness in combination with the hop aftertaste. In my limited exposure to hopped up beers and IPA's the term well refined fits quite well with this one.  M: Thick and creamy with ample carbonation. Slight syrupy character to Ruination that doesn't detract from the feel per say, but is a bit surprising in this type of brew.

147,4083,Stigs,2.82,"12oz bottle, standard pint glass  A - poured a massive head of big pillowy egg shell colored foam, becoming more and more dense as it sits there, and lacing all the way down. the beer is a nice bright golden color and slightly hazy  S - loads of citrus hops, both bitter and sweet. some pine, floral, grassiness...the entire spectrum of the hops world. mouth watering.  T - not sure if this is a bad bottle, an old bottle, or what...all of the yummy hop smells are gone and replaced with all i can describe as, burnt bitter grass. not that good kind of grassy hops, just way off. i used to LOVE this beer, havent had it in a long time - so again i dont know if this is off or my tastes have just changed.  M - trying to ignore the flavor, the mouthfeel is a bit thick, but carbonation is spot on.  D - really struggling with this. ill leave this review as-is, and give it another shot in the future. down the drain this goes.  Note: I have revisited (bottles and tap) this beer a few times since the review, same results. Maybe I outgrew it, but I'm just not feeling it anymore.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Cakanator,4.35,"Bottle. Pours a nice dark golden color with a considerable head. Loads of citrus and pine, a smooth palate up front with a considerable hop bite towards the finish. A classic really, the hops are huge, but not as great as some of the ones produced in the past 5 years. I'll have it on tap anytime.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mikey711,4.06,"MMmmm Hops. I cannot remember the last time I had one of these so this is exciting.  A: Its bright orange with a soapy white head on top that leaves gobs of webbing in its wake. Lots of carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass. Excellent head retention. There is no room for imperfection and this beer does just that, look perfect.  S: Citrus hops mostly, with mango and orange being the predominant note. The hops are not super strong smellling but they are very good  T: Very heavy bitter pine and grapefruit note. Also the caramel comes out nicely to provide a little bit of balance but definitely a palate killer in terms of bitterness.  M: The bitterness of the hops lingers for quite some time and the mouthfeel is very creamy. Also there is no booziness. Again, for the style this is how it should feel.  D: I wouldnt want to many of these in one sitting because of the effect it would have on my palate. It is very tasty but the whole bomber would be a tough task.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ewlarson,4.62,"A: Pale color, a little cloudy, white head goes away fairly quickly. It's a little bit more thin of a head than their regular IPA  S: Sweet smell, outstanding aroma  T: Hops are strong but balanced. You can taste and feel the alcohol, it warms up the mouth and throat. Earthy/floral hops ride over the top, a little citrus as well. Outstandingly strong and potent, coats your mouth with Hops.  M: Strong mouth feel, extremely bitter so it's very intense  D: Extremely drinkable, strong, tasty, extremely hoppy. A good form of what a strong IPA should taste like. The only warning, is just as the bottle and container suggest, it's ruinous to eating anything else. Definitely a beer to be enjoyed by itself.  Overall an outstanding beer. I would highly recommend this.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,josefnewsong,4.27,"Good and hoppy. You have to be in the mood for it, but if you are, it really hits the spot. I love intense - especially pine resiny - double IPAs when I'm outside in the cold for some reason. This ale has a bitter, crisp finish. Obviously on the overly hoppy side, but it never claims to be well-balanced.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,beerdrifter,4.5,"Slightly hazy copper pout with creamy head and nice lacing. Huge resiny hoppy nose with lots of citrus and sweet malts. Taste is pretty much just like the smell, a total hop bomb! But with that said, it's incredibly balanced. The bitterness is nicely complemented by the sweet malts. Lots of orange and grapefruit emerge as you go. A crisp and tangy dry finish makes this highly drinkable for such an over the top beer from one of the top breweries in the world!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Reaper16,4.13,"22oz. bomber served into a tulip (consumed in August 2009)  Pours an intense yellow-orange color, bordering on a saturated tawny shade. It is dense but not cloudy. A gentle pour yielded 1 1/2 fingers of pure, white foam. Lacing is wall-like around the glass.  The aromas are appropriately hard-hitting. Loads of lupulin make for a beer whose hop smells run the gamut from earthy to floral to tropical citrus fruits. Tangerine and pineapple play with rose petal, and there is just enough dirt/root to hold it all together. Some caramel malt opens up as the beer warms. I'd score it higher if not for the slight alcohol presence that distracted from the intensity of aroma.  Immediately I can tell that this bomber is past its peak and is in the declining stage. The intensity of flavor is not there in the maximum effect that one would desire. That isn't to say that this is disappointing, however. The hop flavors are still bright and aggressive but also well-rounded by time. The most noticeable, and pleasurable, flavor component are the citrus lupulin flavors. They hit the palate like a burst of juice. Mango, tangerine and occasionally pineapple flavors that taste like they were fresh-squeezed cover the whole mouth but quickly recede. An aggressively floral summer-garden thing dominates the finish; its like eating flowers in a salad if you've ever had that. There is a lot of malt sweetness, but it takes the background somehow. It never gets in the way of the real focus -- the hops. The pine does open up with warmth and the finish is mostly bitterness given the slight age. Everything is so well-crafted, though. The flavors are deep and in harmony with each other.  The mouthfeel is pretty light considering the amount of malt that goes into an Imperial IPA. Its thickish in ways but not sticky; it goes down smoothly. Like fruit juice. Drinkability is kind of insane for an IIPA. The alcohol is masterfully hidden. And everything about the mouthfeel and flavor profile begs for constant drinking. This bomber is going to disappear in a flash. Perhaps the beer is harsher when fresh, but at this stage the rounded flavors make for the most drinkable IIPA I've ever had.  I'd love to have this beer super fresh. In the state that I enjoyed it in, however, it is still close to world-class in its style. Beautiful, bright flavors working with each other make for a wonderful drink. It is only lacking in intensity on the palate. A couple of weeks longer and my score may not be as high as it is today. Either way, this is a treasure of a beer. Man, I wish that I had regular access to Stone in MO.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,glid02,4.67,"Cask at Aroma's in Athens, GA.  Pours a hazy golden-copper color with a one-finger slightly off-white head. The head recedes into a thin layer on top leaving solid lacing.  Smells of all kinds of hops - floral, grapefruit, orange, pine, herbal - with an emphasis on the citrus family. Pale malt lurks in the background but doesn't play a huge role.  Tastes similar to how it smells. Pale malt flavors up front are quickly overtaken by huge hits of citrus and pine hop flavors with herbal undertones. The hop flavors carry through to a strongly bitter ending.  Mouthfeel is very good. It's got a smooth thickness with soft and grainy carbonation.  Drinkability is very good. I finished my glass quickly and could have a few more.  Overall there's really not a whole lot that could be improved with this beer. Give it a shot if you haven't already.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,stevecee2003,4.9,"Gawd-Damn! What a beer! How have I missed tasting this beer? But now I have, and discovered it. And what a beer!  First off understand I am an IPA man. I love Hops. Double Hopped beer, like Hercules are favs of mine. But this- wow.  Appearance- served from a Bomber bottle. Poured nicely, with a generous head- then faded into a nice haze.  The smell is unreal. You can smell all the hops, plus some citrus. The frutiness makes for an interesting possibility. Lets have a taste..  Taste. OMG. Wow. What a thoroughly fullfilling taste. What an amazing taste, feel, after-taste, and overall gerneral goodness from one beer. That is- IF you like hoppiness, like I do.  The way it feels on the tongue are smooth, watery, and easy- always good.  Notes. There are lacey rings on the glass. Its an IPA, what else do I need to say? It's a bit expensive here. $18 for a 6-pack, and $6.50 for the Bomber bottle. But if you want GREAT beer- here it is. A truly ""great"" beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

What a powerful smell of hops. extreme floral and pine aromas. ... And the label hold true. wow the flavor is just strong. strong but nothing to turn away from. its a task but an enjoyable experience. it has a tart smack on the back of the tongue. the pine flavor is very abundant, then floral hops as well. stone, from what i've tasted so far, tends to always nail the right mouthfeel, as far as carbonation goes. though being a sipper of a beer, its not too heavy making the drinkability really good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,MisterTiat,4.13,"Poured from a bomber  A: Pale color, a little cloudy, white head dissapates far to quickly into almost nothing, not happy about that  S: Wham! Floral, perfumey hops fill up your nose to the point where you feel like sneezing.  T: Hops are better balanced with the grainy breadiness better than I would have thought from the smell. You can taste and feel the alcohol, it warms up the mouth and throat. Earthy/floral hops ride over the top, a little citrus as well.  M: Mouthfeel was a little lacking for me, the beer felt thin, kind of like hop water for me.  D: Very drinkable, although this is definantly an after meal beer, really after you want to be able to taste anything at all besides hops the rest of the night.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Brandt,4.52,this beer poured out a honey gold color with a nice one finger white head  the smell was a very rich and resinous hop smell with a good strong citrus punch from the west coast hops  the taste had a certain astringency to it due to the stong bitterness and a well balanced out amount of good stong citrus hops in the background.  this beer finishes med bodied and with a good lasting bitterness. what a wonderful esample of what stone can do with malt and hops!,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BBThunderbolt,3.42,"Served in straight pint glass. Poured a hazy yellow with about an inch of white head that that had average retention and very good lacing.  Very pleasant mix of pine/floral/citrus hops on the nose. No noticeable malt foundation. The flavors lead and the taste follows obediently, nothing special, just what is expected from this type of beer.  The body is typical for the style. Drinkability is good, this is not as tongue-numbing as some examples of the style, but moreso than others.  Overall, a good, solid brew from a good solid brewery, that may be starting to believe their own hype.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S: Smelled dead on with Hops, slight Pine some citrus.  T: Great, Great taste. Can get much morebalanced thatn this. Perfect hops, alcohol burn in mild, backed up and evened out by the thick head, pine and citrus coming through.  M: Again the sticky head made every swallow perfect. Exactly what I want in a DIPA.

147,4083,portia99,4.45,"22oz bottle poured into a Bruery tulip.  A - Pours a beautiful bright orange orange - almost completely clear, only the slightest of haze. A nice two finger creamy white and dense head forms on top. Good staying power...when it finally yields, leaves excellent lacing on the glass.  S - Fresh citrus and pine. Grapefruit, orange, lemon, some pineapple and pine aromas and a bit of grassiness. This has a little bit of everything for the hop lover. A slight whiff of sweet malt with some breadiness and a touch of yeast.  T - Full flavored - grassy, lots of citrus - getting big blast of orange to begin with...pineapple, grapefruit and pine intermingle in here. Good and bitter - very sharp and crisp. Malt presence is subdued, but definitely there...just enough sweetness and breadiness to blend with the hops - can't say it balances, but it shouldn't either. Hops dominate and it works very well.  M - Body is medium, but heavier than a lot of double IPA's out there. Enough viscosity to sit on the tongue for a brief moment. Bitterness flows through the entire mouth and lingers, begs you to take another sip. Carbonation is bright, but works - very fine bubbles, gives a touch of creaminess to the feel.  D - This is one double IPA that I can't get enough of. A classic that more or less defined the style. This is a standby/go to beer for me. One of the most drinkable DIPA's around. Not a session beer at all, but easy to have a couple of these.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,beervana1858,4.73,"I used to really dislike IPA's but over the last year I have acquired the taste for them. This IPA is called ""Ruination"" because it claims that it will ruin you for other IPA's that may come across your pallet in the future. This is an exceptionally true statement.

147,4083,eljefe21,4.77,"A: Cloudy orange-yellow color. Like a heavy cider. Thick and viscous. Barely able to muster a single-finger head. Tiny, fine lacing.  S: Hops from across the room. Powerful and dry with hints of malt. Smells like it'll be nicely balanced.  T: Nicely balanced for an IPA. The finish in the middle of the tongue leaves a wonderful dry, and slightly sweet, malt flavor. Truly divine mixture.  M: Decent, refreshing carbonation on the front and sides of the tongue. Amazing drying finish leaves you wanting for more. Nice, thick and chewy body to boot.  D: This stuff is good, nay great. I'm drinking an out of date bottle and it's still an amazing journey. Easy to drink, though it hits harder than the 7.7% ABV. I could drink this any time, any place.  Served: in an imperial pint glass from a bottle stamped with an ""enjoy by 9/27/09"" message.

147,4083,Thur123,4.17,"OK, I'm going crazy for this one rick. The color is a bright orange that's slightly duller and less hazy than some of its DIPA brethren, but overall still looks good. The head was white and faint creating nothing more than a small finger and little retention. The smell is amazingly good. Ripe fruity hops fill my nostrils with something like fruity pebbles. The malt underneath seems balanced for the style and sweet, this whole nose kind of comes off as really well balanced and sweet.  Glug glug glug  Well comes it with the bitterness and then the malt comes up, big and sweet as the hops gain a second wind that's full of lemon and big pine sap. A slight edge of herbs and grapefruit ride makes a kind of lighter sweetness towards the end of the flavor. The mouth feel is full and creamy and kind of gas like, I can taste it in all part of the mouth, more than other beers for sure.

A dominate floral hop smell. Very good smell.  This brew is hoppy, very smooth and balanced. A somewhat sweet start and a bitter finish. Nice flowery hop flavor. Also has the bready flavor that balance the palate.  This brew is a very drinkable hoppy brew. It is bitter and does have me burpin' up some flowery hops already, but it is a damn drinkable brew.

Hops are well balanced with solid breadiness with light malt. Finish is tangy with a lingering bite.  M - Effervescent with a medium to light body.  D - Surprisingly easy to drink.

147,4083,JerzDevl2000,4.15,"Picked this up in Totowa recently because this was available as a single bottle and this beer rated pretty highly on here. I'm not the biggest of hopheads but I appreciate a well-crafted beer regardless of the style and without a doubt, this will please any hophead or lover of Stone's beers!  This had a great pour to it - a nice frothy head on top of a gorgeous opaque golden hue that glowed nicely in the light and a good amount of lacing down the side of my pint glass. The taste is hoppy but not overpowering, with a lot of floral, citrus, and pine notes. This is pretty similar to some of Sierra Nevada's offerings but it doesn't have that buttery consistency to it. Rather, it's just a bit thinner and lighter in hue and the head never fully dissipates. I wouldn't say that this has a dry hopped feel to it, but it's not far away either since I'll probably wash this down with a small chaser of water afterward.  The beauty of this beer is that I can't taste or feel the alcohol in this at all. It's strong but only because of what's written on the bottle. As other on here have attested, this is a textbook I.P.A. and won't disappoint anyone looking for the epitome of this style.

Head diffusely forms a thin broken film on top of the beer. A little lacing is left on the glass, not much to speak of. This beer has a lot of haze, as is customary with DIPA these days, it is not clear at all.  Aroma is strong but not overpowering. Some alcohol in the nose, not much, a lot of citrus and a considerable measure of pine. I can pick up a little malt in the aroma as well.  Beer is slightly warm in the mouth. Not a strong alcohol content in the flavor though. Moderate mouthfeel, not too thick not to thin. The definite feel of the beer is in the hop character. There is a lot of back end bitterness, mostly pine in nature, an interesting beer. The midpalate flavors are covered by the high malt. Drinkability is fine. The bitterness grows on me and ends up slowing the consumption.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Natural510,4.2,"Pours that dark golden, near-orange you get from a quality DIPA. Head & lacing do their job, nothing too out of the ordinary. That juicy pine-grapefruit you know and love in a quality DIPA smell. Hops, heavily pined and slightly floral. Juiciness from malt reveals itself and is then drop-kicked by the bitter, burning of hops and more hops, yet not to the point of being undrinkable. Sweet, dry, cloying bitter finish. All the good points for a solid DIPA are met here.

Overwhelming upfront notes of some pine and very bold hops. Mouth-watering.  T: Out of this world. Not nearly as bitter as I thought it would be. Hops from start to finish. Rates a 100 on the IBU. Overall, it reminds me of St. Arnold's Elissa, with more up-front hop notes.  MF/D: Could drink several of these in a sitting, if I could afford it. On the whole, this beer is extremely smooth when I consider the impression the aroma left me with initially.

147,4083,jnezda,4.2,"Tried this in large and small formats from the bottle into a glass. Good beer either way. Based almost solely on the hop profile I would put this in the big beer category. Golden color with eggshell head that sticks around during drinking. Lightly carbonated which is good because I worry a heavy carbonation would push the hops over the limit. The main smell is of the hops and the fruit hints that accompany hops. This is furthered by the flavor which at first is a mouth full of hops. After the first sip begins to settle the traditional IPA flavors and style begin to shine through. This is a good beer all around and is well representative of IPA and big beer.

I also noticed a bitter taste in the back of my throat the entire time.  M: This beer had a good mouthfeel from the low carbonation, creamy but not too dense head, and a good overall specific gravity.

Very tasty and easy to drink though, just don't expect to have anything else that night. Pours a very golden yellow clear colour. Pretty solid over all. More please.

147,4083,flagmantho,4.23,"Poured from 22 oz bomber into a pint glass.  Appearance: slightly cloudy with a tawny-golden hue. Big, bubbly white head with good retention.  Smell: well-balanced hops; that is, well-balanced between spicy, earthy, floral and evergreen-ey. I can't wait to taste it.  Taste: well, my friends, this is indeed a hop bomb. It is not in any way balanced, smooth or compromising. There is a little maltiness in the background, but it is completely subsumed by the intense hop flavor. The beer is fairly bitter, but the hops really show themselves in flavor. It's quite delicious, though possibly out of my league at this point.  Mouthfeel: good body with a relatively oily texture which coats the mouth and promotes the hop flavor.  Drinkability: quite good, considering its intensity. This is probably best consumed with some heady or unctuous foods.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I can smell it from a couple feet away. Oily hops all over the nose. Pine and sweet fruit aromas also present. Very overpowering.  A sweet and toasty malt hits the palate first, followed immediately by an assault of herbal hop flavors. Malt, hops and the alcohol tingle coalesce perfectly. Aftertaste is spicy and citrusy.  A smooth, moderate carbonation and hearty body make this beer delicious on the tongue.  Outrageously delicious and drinkable. It wreaks havoc on the taste buds, which is awesome.

147,4083,Gambrinus1184,4,"Poured from a 22-ounce bomber into a Ro's pint glass.  A: Poured a vibrant golden orange color with a chilled haze and a thick two-finger head of dense white foam. Carbonation was lively and the lacing left was ample.  S: Smells of toasted grain and a lot of resinous hop oil aromas: hop leaf, grass, grapefruit and clove.  T: Taste reveals a quick hit of sweet toffee malts at first, but its just a flash in the pan. The real flavor pours hop resins all over the palate in a puckering manner. Big time herbal and lemongrass hop flavors combine with a bit of white pepper, coriander and spiciness. The burn tastes so good.  M: Mouthfeel is full bodied and oily, but citrus flavors thrown by the hop makeup with some sweet, lighter sips.  D: Start and end with Ruination, and you won't have a problem, besides a splitting headache the next day, probably accompanied by heartburn. A really nice DIPA for the hop fan, and a nice high ABV to keep it fresh tasting off the shelf, which it certainly is. Palate shot.

Leaves nice sticky lacing on the sides of glass....I mean lacing is everywhere with this beer.  S- This is all hops everywhere in the nose. Big upfront of sweet citrus (pineapple, grapefruit, orange) hops with a piney/floral hop hint to it as well. Sweet malts make up the backbone of this beer and are present in faint clashing with the hops. Vey hop forward to say the least.  T- Big bitter hop bite right off the bat on this beer. This leads to a citrusy hop kiss right afte that with pineapple and grapefruit highlights in there. Middle of the beer is where all the sweet caramel malts in the nose of the beer come into play. Nice malty balance on this keeps it from being just a overly hopped beer for the sake of hops. Don't get me wrong I like hoppy beers too. Clean citrusy/light bitter ending on this beer makes it for a complete and balanced beer. Very tasty!  M-Medium mouthfeel. Very crisp and clean feeling in the mouth. Carbonation is good and helps glide the hop bomb across the palate leaving hop resin over everything you could think of. NIce clean bitter/citrus hop combo on the aftertaste wanting you to go back for some more. Very nice to say the least.  D- This is a highly drinkable beer that I would recommend to someone who wants to take the hop plunge but wants something that is not going to wreck it for them. I only wish I could drink more than two bombers of this before going onto something else.

147,4083,rickmick,4.52,"Pours a beautiful mix of golden brown and yellow straw. Small head that fades. Heavy lacing, and a beautiful aromatic nose of hops. Definitely drink this in a snifter.  The taste, is intense. Very balanced hops, not too piney. A really fantastic DIPA.  The mouthfeel is great: syrupy, thick, but never excessive.  The intense tastes makes it a little less drinkable than, say, an equally ABVd beer (like Founders Centenial) but for an DIPA, very drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,SpdKilz,4.2,"Appearance - Pours into my SA perfect pint a light hazy orange leaving about an inch and a half of thick head which leaves great lacing.  Smell - Smells of bitter hops, some pine, grapefruit, then the sweetness/maltiness comes through. Very pleasant. Not overly floral - a nice balance.  Taste - Tastes similar to how it smells. Begins with a smack of hoppy bitterness which lends itself to a nice grapefruit peel that then ends with a thicker, malty taste. Honestly, I was expecting it to be bitter the whole way through but it had a nice malt back to it (maybe this sat on the shelf for a while and mellowed a bit? I keep hearing about how the hops destroy your mouth and I did not get that feeling).  Mouthfeel - Light to moderate thickness. Not overly carbonated but just enough  Drinkability - This was the first drink of the night and it was a bit tough to finish it but only because I was so incredibly full from eating fondue. Overall I was impressed and look forward to getting some fresher bottles soon.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,HopHead84,4.37,"Consumed on 9/29/2009 on tap at Stone. The beer is copperish orange with a fluffy white head. Retention and lacing are both decent, and that's all I'm going to say on the subject.  The beer was served ice cold. It seriously seemed like it was in the low thirties. I couldn't smell anything for nearly 25 minutes. If there's some point in serving a craft beer that cold, I'm missing it. At about the 30 minute mark the nose opens up and reveals orange pith, pine, and grapefruit. It's all very dry, and malt imparts a low level of caramel. Tropical notes become apparent with further warming.  The beer is very dry with an upper moderate level of bitterness. It tastes of bitter grapefruit, orange pith, and pine resin. Caramel notes are quickly overrun by the delicious hops. The finish is very, very dry.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ditch,4.55,"Man O Man this is good!  Poured a light bronze with a thick creamy white head. Head hangs around for quite some time before receding to thin clumpy bubbles and a thick ring around the glass.  Smells of hops, hops, and more hops. Floral, citrus and pine. A woody barley tries to poke through. Also I'm getting a bit of the booze.  Taste is actually well balanced for a beer this hoppy. I expected by the 100+ IBUs, that I would be making a pucker face after the first swig. Flavor is all over. Grapefruit, pine, sweet grain (pretty bready), pineapple... some others in there too, one I can't put my finger on. Oh, this is good!  Mouthfeel is good. Carbonation is perfect for this style.  Drinkability is frighteningly good for this style. I could drink quite a few of these bombers in one sitting.  Not sure that this is a beer to drink on a regular basis. This is a beer to get for those times when you need a hop fix. Like the label says, I think my pallet is ruined for trying anything else tonight. I'm actually new to the hop bus, but I now understand why these beers are so popular. Thank you Stone! This one is amazing!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,OldSchoolGamer,4,"This is the IPA that got me into IPAs. Simply put. I haven't had this beer in well over a year, and in that time, I have had dozens and dozens of stellar IPAs. Lets see if it is as good as I remember.  A: Pours a cloudy golden color. Head is not very large, but lacing is very nice.  S/T: Smells very hoppy and citrusy. A touch of pine in there as well as some grassyness. Taste is actually very well balanced and not overpowering at all. I get a lot of citrus fruit upfront. Lots of lemon and orange. Not as piney as I would like. There is an almost mint leaf like quality in there. Malt is right behind the hops and give off a strong bready flavor. Overall, a solid IPA, but far from the best of the best.  M/D: Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Finishes dry with some lingering bitterness. Drinks like an IPA should. Not overpowering and the dryness makes you go for another sip.  I am admittedly not a huge Stone fan as I find their beers very one-noted and simply lacking. This is one of their better efforts, however. Very nice hop flavoring with a nice balance make this a very good IPA. Not as good as I remember it, but still a nice IPA I would revisit in the future.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,biegaman,4.27,"A lucid, dazzling orange that is blindingly bright when held into the light. Whether it's a naturally occurring haze or those florid rays that bewilder the eyes, one or the other is preventing me from seeing my finger on the other side. Its surface is bundled up with a thin but bubbly strip of white twine.  Chinook and Centennial hops make for a heavenly scented balm. We've since seen this again and again with American IPAs (and DIPAs) but Ruination may have been the first and the one that continues to most clearly illustrate it. Its perfumy solution combines festering, candied and ethanol-soaked citrus fruits and tickles the nose like a feather.  Dissecting these hops turns up flavours of spiked coconut milk, candied pink grapefruit and bubble-gum wrapped tangerine wedges. The flavour is fresh, fruity, floral and lively - like a citrus fruit salad infused with crushed mint leaves, roasted pine nuts and drizzled in honey.  The malts are not entirely inconsequential either. Bready, bakery-fresh muffins and syrup coated pastries make a fairly sturdy base for all this acidic, near-spicy hoppiness. The bitterness isn't crushing, as its name would suggest, it's brisk and snippy and massages the tongue. One thing it isn't is overpowering.  In fact, I'm looking forward to having, not a full bomber, but a full growler of this to drink today. The beer is quenching, its electric blanket-like warming effect notwithstanding. The alcohol is ever-present but fuses well into the acidic citrus. Besides, I'd much rather take the extra percent or two and go with the Ruination over Stone's regular IPA.  Ruination IPA will ruin your chances of ever enjoying an industrially produced lager again. It will ruin your taste for mass-processed beer and even ruin your tolerance for others drinking them. This is a lesson in how beer should be made: with character and with pride. Look at the American micro scene - Ruination IPA has actually built a lot.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,alpinebryant,4.04,"Had this one before, but thought it was time to put a review up after getting it again... Pours a clear marigold color with miniscule bubbles on the sides, minor lacing following down the glass.  Smells of an evergreen forest and a slightly sweet afterthought.  Tastes extremely piney, almost like I have been chewing on a pine tree. Extremely bitter with some two row malt flavor which becomes hardly noticeable with the overpowering flavor from all of the pine hops.  Medium mouthfeel, and a dry afterbite make this drinkable. If you love northern pine, drink away. You may feel like a logger after drinking this one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,PappinAce,4.07,"Appearance: Had this in a snifter-style glass out of a bottle. It poured a nice golden yellow, almost resembled a pale lager. Not much head after the initial pour, maybe a half-inch thin layer. Strong lacing throughout the duration of the drink.  Smell: This is rather aromatic. A few fruits hit you up front, mainly citrus and orange notes.  Taste: Now this is unique. It starts off with a slight hint of malt, but it is soon brushed aside by the dominant flavor of citrus, which bridges the gap from the smell. This is literally the most bitter beer I've ever had, but it fits rather well considering the citrus-y, orange-y flavors. Imagine taking a bite out of a lemon. This all sticks with you on the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: HOPS HOPS HOPS. My tongue got raped by hops, took me completely by surprise. It complimented the flavor well though, and they pop around on your tongue after you've swallowed the sip. The alcohol presence isn't too hidden; you can feel a sort of tangy kick to the alcohol. It was stronger than I expected; one bottle buzzed me, but then again I hadn't eaten in like seven hours beforehand.  Drinkability: Exceptional. It was weird at first, but the hops lingered around on my tongue and made me want more. As I grew used to it, I realized that the bitterness actually gives this one its defining characteristic. This is the Stone's unique quality that really gives it personality, and it grew on me.  It was good, but not something I would drink over and over again. I don't agree with the ""world's best IPA"" label it seems to get.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Nose is all hops, oranges, grapefruits, pine resin, floral, a touch soapy but bright and beautiful.  This is pretty much an all out hop attack and yet it doesn't seem overwhelmingly unbalanced, reminds me a little of Green Flash's IIPA. Tons of hop bite, lemons, grapefruit, tall on the pine resin, just a hint of malt to ride shotgun and keep it from being all hops. Bright carbonation, a really drinkable IIPA.  Need a hop fix? Hard to say no to this one. Looking for balance? Probably not your thing. As for me, loved it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Shakujin,4.3,"Stone Ruination IPA  Appearance:Very light, cloudy, orangish color, perhaps 7 SRM. Poured off tap into pint.  Smell: Very hoppy, cant pick out any specific hops, although citrus is certainly predominant  Taste: Burns so good! Very hoppy and tangy. I think I can taste the liquor and the malts but mostly the hops are just destroying my palate. Maybe its due to that but I thought I got something liquorish like for a second there. The finish is well, it doesn't really finish at all, hops just stay with you. Very harsh, yet refreshing  Mouthfeel: Light and burny.  Drinkability: Fantastic sort of a catch 22, its probably not the kind of beer you want to drink a lot of , but once you start drinking it your not going to be able to drink anything else.

Good beer and faith mix just fine with me.  A-Pours a beautiful orange amber with a two finger head that recedes into a sticky lace all the way down my glass, whether I drink this slow, or faster. A nice effect. Head is bone white.  S-Wow. Very fragrant hops. Piney and citrus. Reminds me of very ripe, sweet tangerines. This is wonderful.  T-Bitter. Yeah, bitter. Insane at 100+. Stone won't disclose the IBUs, at least not publicly. Ruinous to the palette? Could be for some, but not mine. I guess mine has been matriculated. Gotta read the label. I love Stone's labels. There is just enough malt presence to balance this. But the overwhelming flavor characteristic is bitterness. Taste improves as it warms.  M-Surprisingly smooth for a beer this bitter and with a 7.7% ABV. Carbonation is spot on. Not as smooth as Russian River's PtE, but very nice.  This is a very good DIPA, but not great IMO. I gave drinkability a lower score since there are other much more affordable DIPAs, including PtE, that are better, or nearly as good. I especially enjoyed this today after my 100-mile Salem Bicycle Club ""Peach of a Century"" bicycle ride after enjoying Arrogant Bastard Ale.

Definitely lives up to the name, a ruinous amount of hops, very bitter with a smooth malty finish which nicely compliments the bitter hops. Lots of hop oils, bitter hop tastes which linger for minutes on the tongue.  Thick viscous mouthfeel, medium carbonation which feels very refreshing in the mouth.

Taste - this is probably one of the best IPA's i've had so far. I've had a few east coast IPA's and this is my first westcoast IPA. The hops are definitely different for sure, but this is a good difference. Very crisp, lots of citrus and pine notes, defiitely not over the top hops, but well balanced.

Smell is wonderfully filled with hops boasting citrus, pine, grass and nearly lemon-like aroma as well. Taste is a blast of hop bitterness, almost oil-like the way the bitterness rolls around the tongue. However, it gives way to malt sweets as well.

Poured into a snifter, it has a cloudy orange color with a foamy, cream-colored head that dissipates to leave a bit of lacing on the side of the glass. The aroma is pungent with scents of grapefruit and pine hops. The first sip is powerfully bitter without being overwhelming. The next taste is a big gulp that leaves my tongue saturated with hop oils so that the bitterness lingers for a few seconds. Despite this powerful hop character, you could almost call the flavor balanced because of the bit of malt sweetness, and the carbonation makes it go down surprisingly easy.

Smell: This thing is jam-packed with hops. Smells like a pintful of freshly picked hops with an abundant floral aroma with a mix of piney and citrusy intricacys as well. Once your nose fights its way through the forest of hop fields it finds an aroma only comparable to a thick cake batter with a touch of honey.  Taste: The taste is monumental to say the least. So many complex flavors and i guess the only reasonable place to start is with those lovely green cones from heaven. Hops in a bottle but none of them make you pucker more of a tingling grapefruit-esq. The malt swings in like a saving grace to allow you to recover from the palate punch of the lupulin. There is some definite esters here but nothing overpowering, as are all of the flavors: balanced.  Mouthfeel: Somewhat light bodied and quite carbonated, but my what an aftertaste that I welcome. Signature 'stone was here' hop oil fiesta.  Drinkability: Pass me another this one went down too smooth for its own good. Does as the name says. Cyanara Palate!  Overall: Hop bomb for a hop head.. what can i say. Nirvana.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Diablerie,4.5,"An absolute favorite of mine.  Appearance - A sharp yellow-orange coloration, with a nice, frothy white head.  Aroma - A powefully florid smell--the brew is loaded with an arsenal of hops. Definitely notice a bit of a pine scent to it as well. It's a blitz of smells, but overall, I think florid is the best word. The scent of the malt isn't very strong.  Taste - Hops. And some other stuff. No, but seriously, it's difficult to pick apart the hoppiness into its components, not being a trained beer taster and all that. What I can say is that it's a very satisfying level of bitterness.  Mouthfeel - a bit thick and chewy, if chewy is the right word for it. I do have to admit, the satisfaction of this beer lingers all the way from the first scent of it all the way to its absorption into your bloodstream. Mouthfeel is no exception here.  Drinkability - If you have a taste for bitterness and hop bombardment then it is quite drinkable, but it rides the cusp of being a bit too intense. That's probably why I enjoy it so much.  All in all, one of the best examples of an Imperial IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mjaskula,4.16,"Served in a pint glass. Pours a slightly hazy golden-orange with a white head that thins. A tiny bit of lacing, but not much.  Aroma is stunning and bright with floral and citrus notes. Flavor is almost entirely of hops. Strong bitterness and grapefruit flavors, with pine and citrus. A bit of sweet malts in the background. The hop bitterness lingers in the back of your mouth leaving you wanting more. No strong alcohol flavors. Body is light and carbonation is moderate and pleasant. Overall a pretty good DIPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,nickd717,4.17,"This was one of the first beers that got me into craft, as surprising as that might be. First tried a bottle at House of Brews in NYC in 2007 and was enthralled by the long, arrogant description on the bottle.  A - Slightly hazy golden-orange with a nice off-white head and good lacing.  S - Really hoppy, resinous aroma with lots of citrus/grapefruit, pretty typical of Stone's hop profile. A little sweet malt pokes through. Smells great.  T - Hits you hard off the bat with big-time hop bitterness and finishes just as strong. Piney, citrusy, and unapologetic. Nice caramel malt and grapefruit flavors.  M - Surprisingly smooth finish. Medium-full bodied for a west coast DIPA with slight syrupiness and some citric astringency.  D - Well, this kills your palate, but recently after the number of hop bombs I've had, I've found this to have at least average drinkability.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,StJamesGate,4.12,"Pours pale gold, hint of red, with tight lumpy white head. Big honeysuckle, citrus flower, lemon zest + skunk nose. Poundcake sweet malts cut by Creamsickle, orange Bubblicious, chalk and mint leaf hops. Amazingly long puckering astringent nettle sustain. Sticky enough; round; slight burn.  For all the talk of ruin, there's a good malt backbone. Don't really feel the 100 IBUs anymore than I would 70. Intricate hops, though, good West Coast IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,unclewhale,4.2,Introduced to this in Cincinnatti at the Dilly Deli. The aroma was full and very hoppy. The taste went to the tip and sides of my tongue. A very pleasant sensation for such a robust ale. After swallowing a light orange/citrus after taste was refreshing. The pint went down smoothly and I definately wanted another.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,brewdoc75,4.08,"I had the misfortune of having this beer for the first time when it was over a year old. This is definitely not ageable (or good when aged). This one is about 3 months old, not perfect, but better.  A: Orange-yellow. Striking white head that lives for a long time. Perfect carbonation.  S: Beautiful citrus fruits with heaviness on tangerine and a hint of grapefruit. Behold the power of the centennial hop. Fruitiness follows this up with only a hint of malty sweetness. A little underaromatic for me.  T: More of that tangerine that is present in the nose. Much more of it. Finishes with a pleasant grapefruit bitterness. The malts are definitely backstage, maybe a bit too far, with a hint of honey like sweetness.  M: Light bodied and in my opinion perfect for a DIPA. I'm not a huge fan of these caramelly, heavy DIPAs. Pliney is the epitome of an DIPA and it is light to medium bodied. Ruination follows this to the T. In addition, the carbonation is spot on and the head tickles my lips.  D: A damn fine DIPA. It does lack a bit in the flavor and aroma department for me, but otherwise is a fantastic beer. I would really like to try this as fresh as possible, it may reach all fives in this situation. For now, I'll have to settle for my bottles I can smuggle over from Wisconsin.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,PartyBear,4.2,"It settles amber in colour, with a half inch white head, which shows good retention. The carbonation is very lively. The aromas are fruity hops, grapefruit, hints of apple, and a subtle malty caramel base. The bitterness in the taste is monumental, however, it only really hits you after a swift but firm taste of toffee malts up front, after which you are assaulted by a floral bitterness, and perfumy grapefruit. The sustained bitterness of the aftertaste is impressive, and I have the feeling I will be tasting it for the rest of the week.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,meatyard,4.03,"Pours a clear, medium, golden/orange with a fluffy, white head that leaves good lacing and has good retention. The smell is a potent, grapefruit aroma that continues throughout a deep inhale. Malt only becomes present, to a small degree, after the beer warms. The taste is the same as the smell though the hop character is not quite as powerful as in the smell. Bitterness is high. Again. malt only really shows up as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is medium with moderate but steady carbonation. Very drinkable though 2-3 glasses would be my limit.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,nycwinter,4,"Shared a 22oz bottle with a fellow advocate in its birthplace (Escondido).  A= Orange-gold, translucent, substantial head that left thin lace.  S= Pine and grapfruit peel. There is a hint of malt sweetness that is apple or pear-like. Not much though.  T= Strong citrus peel and alchohol up front. Sweetens in the back, but the bitterness lasts throughout.  M= Medium bodied bordering on heavy. Good balance of carbonation and body.  D= Complex enough to sip, but refreshing enough to gulp. Had to sip it to savor my 11oz half. Should have gotten my own bottle.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,rfgetz,3.67,"On tap at RFD in DC...  A: Hazy orange, fluffy white head, decent lacing.  S: Piney and grapefruity hops. Nice earthy whiffs.  T: Very nice because nothing overwhelms. Bitter hops up front through finish and sweet malt backbone. nice earthy grassy flavor.  M: Medium bodied, slightly creamy. Slight coating but not sticky.  D: Very good DIPA, has balance and not a total hop bomb.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Beergeeknut,4.5,Appearance: Poured into a snifter. Out of a 22 ounce bomber comes forth a stunning orange copper color with a very bright white and thick head that leaves behind nice lacing.  Aroma: Wow what an aroma coming this big boy lots of great hoppy goodness. Nice grapefruit notes way in back. Although it is brewed with malt the aroma of the malt is pleasantly swimming and basking in the presence of the hops. Among other sweetness is very sweet fruity notes.  Taste: Can you say hop nuke wow what a monster. It's like the rabbit in Monty Python and the Holly Grail it has nasty big teeth. It's a little bit crisp but it smooths out so nicely. A lot of sweet fruitiness all around. Hops and more hops.  Notes: This is a great offering from Stone. A remarkable beer all through it.

147,4083,burnerfinger,4.67,"A LIQUID POEM TO THE GLORY OF THE HOP  oh yeah babe I am going to jump on board with this one!!!  A: Appearance poured from the 1 pint 6 oz bomber bottle into my tumbler. bleach white head stelles with generous lacing. bright amber-almost yellow. And this brew is decidedly CLOUDY when held up to a light.  S: Smell - HOPS hit you from the start. Earthy pine? Not bitter - maybe ""tart""  T: Taste - I find myself unable to pull any malt out of this at all....it's all hops LOVE IT  M: Mouthfeel - just about medium here. NO alcohol burn at all. at 7.7 that is truly remarkable.  D: Drinkability - well in truth, from the hops that punch you in the face from the first, not very very drinkalbe. In spite of that I think I'll have another....",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BayouBengal1537,4.52,"Poured 22oz bomber into pint glass (all I had) Could right away smell hops A - Poured a hazy orange color with pillowy off-white 2 finger thick head.  S - Wow, floral hops hit your nose right away very strong, citrus hops, earthy/grassy hops, pine, citrus. What a beautiful aroma of beer!!  T - Bitter hops upfront, sticky resiny hops, grapefruit. Very nice malt background up front also but the bittering hops take over and dominate.  M - Medium carbonation and medium feel  D - Putting one or two down is easy and delicious. But I don't see anyone drinking an entire six pack at one time. Overall, it was very balanced and for a hop-head like myself this was heaven in a glass. what a wonderful beer!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,wd40,4.17,"Served on cask at The Old Toad in Rochester, NY  Appearance was cloudy with a minimal amount of head. The carbonation was low (as I expected from a cask) but this actually worked in this beer's favor because it made this otherwise very aggressive DIPA a bit more smooth and mellow. The mouthfeel was that resulted was subtle with a nice lingering bitterness.  The smell was suprisingly aromatic considering that it came from a cask. Very fruity and sweet actually. Some grapefruit notes came through. The taste was excellent. I think I prefer this beer on cask because it is much more drinkable despite being just as hoppy.  Exceptional beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,JordanEllwanger,4.52,"Golden transparency with a full head and it lacing to follow.  Smell is strong with sticky hops and more hops. Irresistible to taste.  Taste is strong hops all over with a small detection of malt. Very grassy with its bitter bite. Somewhat sweet.  Feel is biting with bitternes over every portion of my pallet. Aside from that it has a very medium feel to it.  A great IPA very drinkable. Could sit down to a sixer with this.  Cheers, Jordan.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mdale13,4.5,"A- Poured into a standard pint glass. A muddled, hazy orange, with a billowy, think white head. Head remained through out the drink.  S- Hops! Citrus, pine, grass. Malts are present, giving it a nice, balanced, pleasant aroma.  T- Bitter, bitter, bitter. Numbs the tongue a little bit. Sticky hops. Grapefruits. Apples maybe? Alcohol is not noticeable.  M- Very Smooth, moderate carbonation. Bitterness stings the tongue in a pleasant way.  D- Goes down easy. After I finished my bomber, I wished I had another.  Other- I really enjoyed this beer.

147,4083,scottyshades,4.12,"Damn, this beer is pretty intense! A: Pours a slightly hazy orange/copper color that produces a massive, fluffy, billowy head that retains exceptionally well and leaves a nice coating of lace along the glass. Great pour!  S: Unreal hop schedule on this one. Holy shit. Floral hops are in your face intense, also present are the bittering hops that give the nose a nice twangy note. Firm malt base in the background provides some nice balance. The notes from the hops are very spicy and citrusy. Grapefruit galore, orange peel, hay, and a nice earthy grassy note. Very very nice nose.  T: Note quite up to par with the nose, but still exceptional. Very bitter hops dominate the palate and pretty much crush it. The warning on the back of the bottle is correct in that it will make everything else taste bland! A nice balance with the malt background, however it is a little too bitter and intense for me. But...I do appreciate the dedication put into this recipe. Grapefruit and orange peel are still present.  MF/D: Very dry & bitter, medium body, very nice carbonation, lingering bitter hop finish.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ThaBobfather,4.38,"Pours a translucent copper with some fluffy white head. Smell is highly floral with some very earthy, and apparent hop aromas. Taste is highly bitter with a flowered taste of hops with some slight bitter malts as balance. Finish is crisp and a little wet but highly floral and hoppy. Drinks GREAT at 7.7% with this hop profile.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,kels,4.2,"Appearance: The liquid from the bottle poured into my pint glass is a lovely cloudy apricot color with a tremendous amount of carbonation bubbling through it. A 2-finger frothy and thick white head fades and retains at a substantial skim, large bubbles breaking through the creamy surface here and there. Sheets of fizzy white lace remain behind.  Smell: The smell definitely reflects the hoppiness of the beer. Strong bitter citrus that's part grapefruit and part lemon meets a little bit of sticky pine scent. There's only a hint of toasted malt in the nose.  Taste/Mouthfeel: The taste is, naturally, huge. Lots of bitter, sticky hops come through in the different flavors of crispy green apple, bitter and sweet grapefruit and a bit of pine sap. The malts do come through slightly, providing some graniness and sweetness to the profile. Alcohol is surprisingly not over-present in this beer, though it shows itself as hot vapors in the aftertaste and the gradual warming in my cheeks. Feel is brightly carbonated and thickly sticky with a surprising drying element in the aftertaste.  Drinkability: Can't say it's too high, but then again, it's not really supposed to be, right? Very tasty and definitely a great beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,TheViolator666,4.26,"12 oz. bottle poured into Stone Levitation tulip  A: This one is exceptional looking. Golden color with huge foaming head that leaves fantastic looking lacing down the glass.  S: Smells of piney hops and grapefruit notes.  T: Pummeled by the hops instantly. Leaves an extreme lingering hop effect that truly ruins your palate! Citrus/grapefruit notes, also a bit of sweetness in the aftertaste. Very big taste that is obviously dominated by hops and no real malt presence.  M/D: Surprisingly very drinkable. I've got no problem putting one or two of these down, but I couldn't foresee anyone drinking a full six pack. Carbonation is medium and the body is on the fuller side.  One of the very first real craft beers I had a few years ago. I remember swearing I'd never drink this kind of beer again.

147,4083,sjccmd,4.62,"I'm not sure how fresh this is. I got it from Whole foods and they don't seem to have a quick turn-around.  With an initially cautious pour, the beer seemed to gloop into the glass without much head, but the head eventually erupted nicely. Pours a slightly murky orange with a white head.  The nose screams of pine. One of the most piney IPAs I've ever come across. Grapefruit, honey and a solid malt backbone.  The taste is not quite as explosive as the nose suggested. Citrus hops initially, pine one again (but not nearly as much as the smell) honey sweetness. It seems to start out nice and sweet but finishes with a punch of bitter hops.  It has a nice slickness. It's relatively thick, but when I let it sit in my mouth for a second carbonation bubbles begin the erupt providing an interesting delayed crispness. Bitter hops linger on the finish.  The balance between the sweetness and bitterness makes this very drinkable considering how many IBU's this is supposed to have.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ledomelor,4.97,"Had on cast at O' Brian's pub in San Diego in a pint glass, July 2nd, 2009 this review is a little overdue  A: A nice thick golden pour, it was noticeably more cloudy on cast then from the bottle. Nice frothy two finger head with good lacing  S: Very aromatic, the cast brings out the melon a lot more, along with this the hops. And more hopes. Very sweet tangy, but not overbearing citrus smell  T: Its hoppiness is first noticeable, and then grapefruit follows and possibly lemon. Definitely characterized by piney hops, however it wasn't over bearing and had a very nice balance with the citrus fruits. The bitterness comes out more in the Cast, which I thought it made it the perfect amount  M: Very nice mouth feel, and very crisp, and less carbonation in the cast, which I greatly preferred over the bottle. Nice lingering in the back of the palette leaving a constant reminder of how enjoyable this beer is  D: I could drink this stuff all day long, but I have to save up for a car...  Overall: I have loved this beer for a long time now, but if you have the chance to get it on cast it makes a huge difference. The flavors pop out even more and the lighter carbonation allows the beer to really linger in your mouth",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S- tons of pine and grapefruit  T- Grapefruit and a slightly floral. Also pine.  M- It was crisp and bitter. kind of drying.  D- wasnt as ruining as i thought.

Subtle notes of grapefruit and a light floral aroma can be found in the background.  Taste is slightly bready at first but the hops kick in fast. Some hints of grapefruit, lemon and hot pepper notes can be detected, but this one is largely dominated by piney hops.  Medium to heavy bodied with moderate carbonation. This is definitely geared towards hopheads and thankfully, right up my alley. Aptly named, and as long as you're a fan of hoppy beers, this should be a great option to turn to.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The citrus and pine of hops shown through, in a beautiful, beautiful way.  T: Again with the hops. Bitter bitter bitter.  M: Extremely crisp.  D: easy to do a little more than sip.

T - The citrusy bitterness slightly outdoes the floral and citrusy hop flavor but it's a close call. A rich toasted malt provides the perfect foundation. The alcohol also contributes to the balance. This is a complex and complete DIPA.  M - Thick and chewy with a low to moderate carbonation of very fine bubbles.  D - I've always wanted to try a truly fresh Ruination and this opportunity didn't disappoint. Ruination is a truly great beer.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,SPLITGRIN,4.19,"I have had this beer in many forms many times, but it is time for a formal BA review.  A strong pour gets a fat fingers worth of fuzzy off white head that lasts for a few minutes and leaves no lace. The body is the tone of hazy honey that leans a little more towards amber. Nose is beautifully hoppy with the hops more of a pine veggie feel. First sip is very fresh and crisp up front then with a nice hop character that is like orange rind marmalade. With following sips the hop profile builds in strength, complexity and bitterness. The piney bight comes to the front as you drink also. The hops become so dominant that the whole mouth is overtaken creating a hugely bitter hoppy whole mouth feel. I don't mean for this to come off as a bad thing though, because through all this it is a wonderfully drinkable brew targeted at hop lovers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,cbros,4.42,"Serving type- 12 ounce beer with no born on date poured into a pint glass.  A- Pours a straw yellow, almost keen to a pale ale. There is a fair amount of head retention that disipates after about half the beer has been consumed. There is little to no cling to the glass. A small amount of carbonation activity present after the pour but that quickly went away as well.  S- I get a strong malty sweetness smell upon sticking my nose in the mug. They are mixed with the hop presence that brings a string citrus note to the table.  T- There is a small hint of the malty sweetness in the beginning followed closely by the bitter whomp of the hops. It is that bitterness that follows you all the way down. This is a strong beer and the alcohol shows itself at the end.  I have had this beer numerous times and was suprised when I realized that I had not reviewed it yet. I remember getting a bomber of this in a trade long before Stone was distributed here in NC. Now that I am able to get my hands on it at any time I really don't buy it anymore. This is a solid Imperial IPA and one of the very first kinds that brought me into the Imperial IPA realm. I have since explored various other variations of this style and have found that even though this was a good beer there are others out there that I find a tad bit better. I am glad that I bought a few bottles of this, for old time sake, and I plan on gettting this again in the future; however I am sure that I will reach for something else when I am searching out an Imperial IPA 9 times out of 10 but there is always that 1 time, like now for example.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I get a hint of the malt on a second whiff. This beer is very bitter. Its bitterness overpowers any malt. It is not very drinkable. I don't think I would really want a second in a sitting. It has its place, but definitely not a session beer. Although, this would be a good starter if I had to attend a festival or party that was going to serve Miller Lite. It would probably destroy that skunky taste.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mcbSTL,4.22,"22 oz, bought at Bourbon and Canal in Terre Haute, IN for approx $6.  Dark gold. Medium head.  Citrus, grapefruit, orange peel, tropical fruit, a dose of pine and earth. Swirling does this beer well.  Just massive hops. Slight maltiness but very much an afterthought.  Bubbles popping on roof of mouth. A bit suprising that these 100+ IBUs didnt numb my mouth faster. Not leaps and bounds more bitter than other IPAs I've had recently.  Bubbles popping on roof of mouth. Deliciously smooth.  Big taste but not outrageously high ABV.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Gosox8787,4.43,"Served from a bomber bottle into a glass in two parts. The bottle says this beer has 100+ IBUs. Should be great. As I crack the top of the bottle, there is a burst of citrus aroma. The appearance is golden orange to red amber with a one finger, pillowy white head. The aroma is all hops, in citrus and pine form. The flavor follows suit, but has layers of flavor. A sweet floral note hits the palate first and is followed by grapefruit notes. A sharp bitter aftertaste of pine ends this beer. Certainly lives up to its name. Mouthfeel is rather heavy and lightened by oily hop resin. Drinkability could be better due to the high ABV and the intense flavor, but this beer is meant to be savored.  Overall, certainly one of the best IPAs I have ever had. Intense, complex, and balanced flavors make this an exceptional brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,blackearth,3.1,"Purchased from Ray's Liquors in Wauwatosa, WI. Poured a very bright, light gold body with not much foam at all. Could this be an old bottle? I see sediment in the bottle... Aroma is great -- fruity and citrusy hops. Medium bodied, this beer blasts you with hops up front which then linger on the sides of the tongue. Spicy bitterness that is on the end of the spectrum that I don't like. Warming alcohol feeling in the finish. I won't be trying this again unless I see it at a tasting where I might get a sampling that is more fresh.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,natelocc787,4.31,"This beer is a hop bomb. We all know that. But a good beer should taste good. This one does but it doesn't taste great. Either too hoppy or unbalanced this beer seems like the ""cool"" pick. Like if you are a true hophead then you have to like it. Sorry I'm a leader-not a follower. Here is the scoop:  A-I pored in a Young's pint glass. I could see halfway through the pour there would be no head to I started splashing this beer. Still was left with a very disappointing little head. One finger. Once the glass was half gone you could see lacing-barely. Not good in my book. The Stone IPA has a MUCH better appearance.  N-Incredible despite the lack of foam. Piney, very floral, grapefruit and tangerine, pine sap and fresh pineapple leaf. Very thorough, hoppy aroma. Amazing pungency.  T-Too hoppy. I love hops and double/imperial IPA's. This is no doubt a good beer and well crafted. It's just too unbalanced. I'm not a hop pussy by any means, I am a true hophead. Why not just steep some hops and then drink it? Cuz it would taste like shit! However this is a good beer it just has an overpowering hop flavor.  Pinecone, hops, hops and more hops, pungent white grapefruit, spice, jasmine, honey, unripened mandarin, freshly cut grass and pine sap.  M-Good but again-not great. Bubbly, semi-thick and potent. I look for a more crisp, syrupy balance in Double IPA's. Still though-pretty good.  D-Not the best. A beer that overpowers your palate such as this one isn't the type I would like to drink many of. A better balanced beer scores higher in this category.  It's worth a try but unlike the Hop Stoopid (twice a month), this is one I may drink twice a year.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,slk22,3.58,"Pours a honey color, slightly cloudy, with a cream colored head that showed moderate retention. Aroma was of moderate strength and seemed simple and straightforward consisting of a orange and grapefruit citrus hop presence. Taste was sweet upfront with a noticeable orange citrus flavor and hints of honey. Hop bitterness comes through very strongly on the finish, lingering through to the next sip. Bitterness was a bit much for my taste in this style. Mouthfeel was smooth and pleasant for this medium bodied offering.

147,4083,CosmoHopHead,4.5,"A: pours a beautiful dark orange color with a nice one inch white fluffy head  S: smells bitter, citrusy and wonderful. like pungent west coast hops.  T: oh the taste. yummy! super bitter hoppiness with a heavy citrus/grapefruit linger.  M: feels oily with medium carbonation. makes my tongue tingle and my cheeks pucker a little  D: At 7.7%abv I could easily drink several of these with no problem.

147,4083,mtnbikerpa,4.34,"Poured from a bomber bottle into my tanker mug (32oz). The head and foam looked like it came off a coffee drink about an inch and a half high. Sticks to the glass. Just by smell I can tell it is a hop bomb and that is putting it mildly. Citrus, pineapple along with the earthy, woodsy, piney flavors prevail. Very smooth mouthfeel but the alcohol is very hidden although it is relaxing to drink.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,nomomentwasted,4.25,"Had this on cask today at Stone after having had it out of the taps at Stone a few times and out of a bottle many more times. My friend's first legal brew as today's his 21. Not a bad way to start, lads.  Appearance: Minimal head, as tends to happen from the cask, and carbonation looked low from the get-go. But a brilliant orange-brown hue that laced decently for a cask beer.  Smell: Not as incredibly hoppy as its brethren in other forms, but the hops are still there for certain, but it smelled so much sweeter, like esterified and fruity, even. Not quite like a Belgian, but much more so than on tap or in bottle. Interesting.  Taste: Still a palate demon, but not nearly to the same effect. I felt like I was drinking Ruination with less hops and more sweet malt, like it was balanced. What?! Is this right? A beer designed to not be balanced being balanced? The huge hops are both blunted on the front and back end by that fruitiness, making for an entirely different drinking experience.  Mouthfeel: Still brutal on the palate, much more of a tongue lashing than Pliny the Elder or Pure Hoppiness, but not necessarily in the taste department. Carbonation is lower, yes, but the sweetness makes in not quite so enamel-eating, tongue-buckling as it otherwise can be.  Drinkability: Due to the relatively warm temperature for an IPA, it's a little less-so than a cooler D/IPA, but still very nice and enjoyable. Definitely glad I could enjoy it on cask as well.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,hardy008,4.33,"Pours a pale orange color with a foamy white two finger head with a sticky lace. The aroma is strong grapefruit peeling, pine, and floral hops. The taste is a match for the aroma, but I detect a bot of a malt backbone with some sweetness to it. It is not real strong, but it is there. The hop flavor is dry, bitter, and somewhat oily.  Medium bodied, nice carbonation, dry, and bitter, but not overly bitter. Nice drinkability. A nice DIPA. Not as sweet as some, but still quite good. *** Tried again on 3/31/2011.  Perhaps the last bottle was a little old. I did not know how to check the date code then. This bottle there is the aroma and flavor of grapefruit and orange which I did not taste before. No grapefruit peeling this time. Revising the score upward. Previous overall score was 4.10.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,MeadMardigan,2.86,"On a recent trip to Chinatown in San Francisco, my brother and I decided to venture away from the typical BBQ Pork Buns on the Dim-Sum menu, and ordered the Bitter Melon and Beef. I should have known, being in Chinatown, that my Western conception of melon as sweet and tangy would be challenged, but I was completely and utterly floored by just how bitter the Bitter Melon turned out to be. When I say floored, I mean it. We nearly fell out of our chairs. B-I-T-T-E-R.  When you pick up a bottle of Stone's Ruination IPA, you are not left wondering about the experience to come. Not a little type is wasted on bragging to what great lengths Stone has infused their IPA with bitterness. Perhaps too much. While one does drink an IPA for the bitterness, one should also expect it to satisfy more than a small area on the back of your tongue.  Not only was the beer not as bitter as expected, but that was the overwhelming taste characteristic present. A good IPA should be bitter, yes, but not a one trick taste pony. I'd hoped, being so highly praised on this site, that Ruination IPA would be more engaging, but I was more or less bored after the first sip, but I guess that's partly the point. The label itself says that after a single taste, even food would turn to ash in your mouth, but I didn't know that the beer was included in that ruination.  If you like IPA's, you'll probably come upon this one eventually in your search for the best, but I think you'll be disappointed. Ruination IPA; well said.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,kaiserbrown,4.5,"I'm very disappointed that, as far as I can tell, I cannot get this beer in Minneapolis. I had it the past two nights while visiting friends at the always excellent Sunset Grill & Tap in Boston. Poured in a tulip glass.  A: Pours a deceptively light gold-straw color. Decent lacing. No indication of the 105(!!!) IBU hammer about to hit your palate.  S: Powerfully hoppy, as expected. Difficult to pick anything out beyond the nose of glorious, delectable hops.  T: The first time I tasted this beer, I pounded my friend so hard on the back that he was unsure whether I adored or despised the brew. My admiration hasn't flagged in the time since that day. Bruisingly hoppy, which is most definitely not for all imbibers, but still balanced enough that the hops don't utterly overshadow the underlying malts.  M: I don't know that I have words to describe how wonderful this feels going down. Crisp, sharp, and leaves the perfect bitter aftertaste on the back of the tongue.  D: Shockingly drinkable, even a potential session beer. Somehow maintains its sledgehammer appeal without being overwhelmingly alcoholic or heavy.  O: One of my favorites, and one that I'd drink regularly if I'd the opportunity. Definitely not for everyone- if you aren't a fan of hoppy beers you probably won't enjoy this to the same extent as a dedicated hop-head. Still. Delicious.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,woodychandler,3.78,"For me, it seemed like the chance of a lifetime to have this on cask while visiting the Pizza Port Solana Beach location.  The draw settled into a finger-and-a-half of thick, tawny head with fantastic retention, especially given the heat and (relative) humidity. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose was very estrous with banana being the prevalent smell. Mouthfeel was really smooth with a light, honey-like taste on the tongue. Finish was smooth with a slight hoppy biterness that reminded me to slow down. Yow!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,beerwolf77,4.5,Time to drink like the big boys. I pour this beer into my pint glass and I feel empowered. It looks amazing. A beautiful cloudy golden hue is capped by at least two inches of off white head. The head settles leaving a cap that rests nicely on top of my glass. The aroma is.... HOPS! What the f*$k did you think it was gonna smell like. It smells like pure hops period. I can't find adjectives to describe it. Piney is an understatement. The flavor is so bitter and hoppy. It makes me pucker all the way to my toes. I imagine if you picked fresh pine needles smashed them into a grapefruit then took a bite. You couldn't get a more piney bitter taste in your mouth. It just keeps going too. I take a gulp and a minute later all I can taste is hops. I love it. It's medium bodied and leaves your mouth feeling tired and abused. This is a great DIPA. I will pick this up again.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,kirkpjr,4.59,"poured into a pint glass, produced a small amount of head, nice lacing as well  appearance: golden color with small head  smell: hops!!, grapefruit, citrus, and little pine - the smell is one of my favorite parts of this beer  taste: powerful hops, the grapefruit delivers but not as much hoppy taste as smell; bitter, but very drinkable  mouthfeel: the candied hops coat the mouth, but not in a bad way; nice malt backbone to complement the hops  drinkability: one of my favorite beers, but to be enjoyed in small doses; i would love to drink this all day but don't know if my tastebuds could handle it; pleasantly ""ruined"" i would say",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Mistofminn,4.12,"Pours a slightly amber golden color, more golden than amber. Light carbonation rising from the center of the glass. A gorgeous head and impressive lacing round out the look.  The nose is powerful. Alcohol? Not a chance. I would be impressed if you could pick out the alcohol over the apricot and grapefruit hop character. Soo juicy. Despite the overwhelming fruitiness, there is a substantial earthy/piney hop character as well.  Sadly, I don't think the taste measures up to my expectations given the aroma. Don't get me wrong, it's powerful, it's great. Fruity and piney, but looking past it I can see the malty backbone. Surprisingly balanced. This one absolutely destroyed my palate. Milk tasted like water after this (literally water...). Great stuff, just not as good as I was expecting given the nose.  Mouthfeel is sharp and bitter. The bitter aftertaste won't leave my mouth, literally. Drinkability is high, but gets it's score because of the extreme bitterness.  Overall, this was good stuff. I'm not sure if it is deserving of it's rank among the best in the world, but that just shows the taste of most people on this website. If you like over the top hops and don't plan on tasting anything else for the next 12 hours, you should try this one. If you are new to the craft beer scene or aren't a confirmed hophead, than dear god stay away!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BeerPhan86,4.37,"Ah yes, been wanting to try this again for some time. I remember it being one of my favorite beers from my favorite style.  A - Pours a nice orange gold with an off white head.  S - Strong hop aroma and earthiness. Smells like a pine forest almost.  T - Wow, intense and sweet hop bite up front, that lingers with a nice bready hop taste. Finishes with malt. What really makes this different from other doubles is that you get the great malty/bready taste instead of just a straight hopslam to the face. These two tastes are balanced and play with each other. It's very enjoyable. A bit more bitter than most doubles but I love that.  M - Creamy with a medium body.  D - I consider this a special treat when I buy a bomber every few months. It totally destroys my tastebuds, and don't plan on tasting any other hoppy beer after, it will be much more bland. The bomber alone has me feelin' pretty good so I don't think I would session this.  Overall a great double. Not AS boozy as others but still enough there to kick you in the pants. Definitely give this one a shot if you can!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Nice darkish amber color, its a really clear brew, not many bubbles.  Scent of piney, citrusey hops, the smell is all about the hops, its rather refreshing too.  ""The moment after the first swallow, all other food and drink items become substantially more bland than they were just seconds before."" Not really but thsi brew has a great taste, the bitterness is up there but beyond it its hop bliss. Not alot of malt here. Just sucking on that bottle with a little beer in the bottom gives you the full hop flavor.  This stuff goes down like candy water though, i think i could easily down a 6pack of bombers.

A: slightly foggy burnt orange color, poured with a 2 finger fluffy white head that shrank, but remained existent till the last sip, sticky spotty lacing top to bottom  S: Citrus, lots of hops, bready malt, smells like excitement!  T: The malt almost has a slight jolly rancher sweetness to it and is well defined, its not overly sweet like some other stone brews. With the added age, the hops really mellowed out, they still deliver their flavor profile but do so with much less bitterness then a fresh ruination. Dare i say this is almost balanced! Fantastic!  M: how a DIPA should be, never thin, and a noticeable resin quality to the liquid. Right on target.  D: This is extremely drinkable, destroys your palate to the point of not even daring to try another brew after one of these as it will most likely taste like swamp water.

The taste has a good bite to it, but nothing extraordinary. That is until I began to eat my tortilla soup that I had to go with this beer. The back of the bottle says that this beer ruins the palatte, making any food taste bland. Quite the opposite. This beer actually made the spicy Tortilla Soup hotter. The beer magnified the spices of the soup on my lips, which was almost painful.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Pours from the bottle a thick golden amber color with a big white head with tons of lacing, the aroma is of lemons and of course tons of hops, the hops take you to a back alley and kick the crap out of you. Taste is awesome just a great combo of hops and just enough malt to make it a beer and not just a hop tea.

Very sweet and floral right up front. This fades through to a big bitter burst. Really tasty with great punch. Nice lingering bitterness with just a touch of earthy vegetal aftertones.  Medium body which holds up well against the beer. Average carbonation suits this well.

147,4083,ricke,3.92,"A: Cloudy yellow color with a nice white head that settles a little to fast. Some lacings.  S: Smell is very hop forward, but still rather balanced. Lots of hop resins and citric notes. It goes a little perfumy, but not overly so. Hints of pine-needles. However, the hops seem a bit faded and have probably lost some definition since the bottling. The malts get through really well with a nice complementary caramel-like sweetness and aromas of white bread.  T: Loads of hop resins and grapefruit in the mouth. But again, the hops seem to be on a downward slope, so I guess this bottle isn't completely fresh. A hint of tobacco and more floral and grassy hop notes. The malty backbone is fresh with a pleasant semi-sweet taste of caramel and white bread. The finish is very very bitter with lots of hop resins and pine-needles. The bitterness actually gets a little overpowering since the hop aromas doesn't seem to hold up.  M: Medium body with a slightly sticky mouthfeel. Refreshing carbonation.  D: A very good DIPA with lots and lots of hops and complex flavors. Despite the massive bitterness in the finish it really manages to come off quite balanced. Too bad I suspect that this bottle was a little old.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Pine and grassy aromas as well. Big citrus blend going on here. Big biscuit malt flavor.  Taste: Damn, this beer is hoppy. This beer will wake you up. Huge floral, pine, grassy taste. Some pineapple citrus sticks out front and then is backed up by grapefruit citrus. Very bready malts make a feeble attempt to balance this beer out. It is just incredibly hoppy.  Mouthfeel: I bet you'd be surprised if I said this beer was very bitter. Booze shows here. Medium bodied. A well level of carbonation. This beer is a palate crusher. Don't drink this one first in a session. Leaves just a floral aftertaste, a little boozy, but nothing to stick or dry. Now that is what I love about this beer. Most beers like this leave the worst aftertaste. Very impressed.  Overall, this is a massive beer. A 12 oz size seems to be just perfect. I would not want more of this than 12 ounces. Good beer, but f-ing hoppy. This is one of the reason the west coast is known for their ipas/dipas. Well done.

A - Pours a slightly hazy deep orange color with a finger and a half of creamy, off-white head. This drops to a thick cap with great lace.  S - Intense hop aroma - pine, grapefruit rind, floral and herbal notes, etc. There's a noticeable, but not overpowering, sweet malt backbone with a hint of exotic fruitiness.  T - Bready malt sweetness and a little more of that fruitiness before the hops punch their way through to the top for an aggressive, but smooth and spicy finish. Long, bitter, piney aftertaste. There's a little alcohol bite as well.  M - Actually feels slightly chewy, but maintains smoothness via fairly crisp carbonation, creating a creamy feel. Warming alcohol is present.  D - An absolutely delicious, but equally devastating brew.

I'm a big fan of their traditional IPA and having just tried the arrogant bastard at a beer tasting, was looking forward to getting into this one.  It pours a very attractive dark golden colour. It's clear with a shower of pinpoint sized carbonation that rises to the surface creating a beautiful white creamy head. Text book rings of lace carpet the side of the glass as you drink it.  The smell is nice. Lots piney hops and citrusy fruit meets the nose every time. The taste has more though. Initially it's all about hops. The first sip took my breath away with them. But after the initial shock there is much more. It starts off with a solidly sweet and fruity malt base and then transitions well into a very hop dominated finish. It's bitter, complex and satisfying as all hell. The alcohol is there but its no match for the hops.  Mouthfeel is silky smooth and for such a strong beer the whole thing goes down remarkably fast.

147,4083,oxnard111,4.87,"Beer newb here. Second beer review.  Wonderful Double IPA. I have tried tons of beers but haven't kept track and taken notes until recently. Pales are becoming some of my favorite brews. Here goes my review:  A - Mostly clear, but very lightly cloudy, golden color. 1.5 fingers of a white-light tan head. Low-medium carbonation level. Medium head retention. Head laces down sides of the glass. Leaves sudsy bubbles on top of the liquid once head has receded.  S - Strong piney and hoppy smell in the foreground that leaves a citrusy residual smell. Slightest yeast/biscuit smell.  T - Just like the smell Pine and hops are the main players, with an underlying citrus/grapefruit taste mixed into the foreground. The after taste is strong but not over powering. After taste lingers on the pallet. Malty and yeast flavors are hidden but are recognizable. Bitter but not overly so. Just prefect in my opinion. Brewer hit the nail perfectly with the flavors.  M - Semi thick. Balance of flavors of course leans closer to the hoppy side, but is not over powered. Low-medium carbonation level that is very inviting.  D - Only thing about this beer that might be a slight downfall for me. When I think of drinking beers, I imagine myself wrenching on cars or my jetskis. This is not a beer I can see myself drinking while wrenching. This is more of a social and evening brew. I could see myself drinking 1-2 pints of this in a sitting, but would need to balance it out with an amber, red or nut ale.  Don't be scared of the 100+ IBU, may not be for a non pale lover, but defiantly is drinkable even for beginners. This brew is the definition of a Double IPA. Beautiful aromas with an equally inviting taste and drinkability. Strong A grade beer here.  I am planning on visiting the Stone facility in three weekends from now. I am super excited. I can't wait to try this brew on tap.  Side note. My local brew house (Anacapa Brewing Company) has a summer Double IPA that I would probably rate just as equally. This is my only solid comparison for double IPA's. The Anancapa brew is maybe slightly sweeter which has its place.  Serving was out of a bottle poured into a kindy crappy tulip glass. I have some quality glassware on order. After the initial pour I poured the rest into a pint glass where the carbonation and head height made themselves more prevalent.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The smell is all grapefruit and bitter hop. No malt, excellent.  The taste is grapefruit, pine and some spicy hops. Very bitter hop flavors roll over each other, as with the nose there is no malt.  The beer is well-carbonated, has a great bitter profile and finishes nice and dry. It highlights all the things you want when you drink an IPA and takes them to the extreme.

147,4083,mpsul2,4.09,"A very special beer to me, so my first review ever on beer advocate. Stone Ruination IPA sports a clear golden appearance, pretty standard for an IPA, but not my favorite. My favorite attribute of this beer is the sweet fruity aroma. Call my crazy, but I smell some cotton candy in there. The taste does not follow through with the aroma's promise. Although I enjoy the bitterness of IPA's, Ruination is slightly TOO bitter. I wish there was more of that fruity taste the aroma made me crave. Crisp feel in my mouth. Relatively acidic, but not overpowering. Would get a 5, but sometimes Ruination leaves me with a soapy aftertaste. Sip this beer! Enjoy it. Don't crack it open during the Super Bowl. This beer is a bit too bitter for me to have more than two 750ml. This beer is special to me because it taught me how unique beers can be. The first beer I tasted that wasn't in a 30. Stone Ruination IPA gave me my passion of craft beer. Enjoy this beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S: I would douse myself in this every morning as a cologne would it not arouse too much suspicion at the office. Hoppy hoppy joy joy!!!  T: Smooth and hoppy! Not bitter, but almost buttery. Citrusy, but overall, this is a malty IPA. Once delicious brew. The alcohol provides a warming affect that you feel more than you taste.  D: I would say that this is a very drinkable beer.

147,4083,GeezLynn,4.2,"A lighter IIPA, hefeweizen color, slightly cloudy with a faint orange tint. White suds, decent retention.  Dense hop smell. Tough to separate out much else, maybe some biscuit. But the hops are quite a show in themselves once the beer is warm enough.  Loads of grapefruit, pine in the house. Any malt body gets buried by the hop avalanche and swept down the hop river before you can pick it up. I suppose you could safely use the word bitter.  Slightly under-carbonated and not as clingy as some but a smooth feel to it.  Drinkability is good for a beer this potent, but the fact that your taste buds get worn out is also relevant.  Ruination really had more citrus than I can remember in a beer. Lots of character. Very hoppity, hop hopper. Glad Stone makes this and is fun for the occasional hop binge.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,JoeMayo,3.85,"A- Pours a clear yellow/amber color with a hefty white head that leaves giant splotches of lacing down the glass.  S- An obnoxiously hoppy, but yet extremely complex aroma floats up from the rocky head of the beer. A bitter, piney aroma hits the nose first, but a plethora tropical notes follows close behind. Hints of pineapple, grapefruit, honey, and peach comes through, balanced by a hint of tobacco. A caramelly backbone compliments the honey aroma.  T- Intense pine and tobacco with subtle tropical fruit notes. The hops definately dominate the flavor and although notes of honey and caramelized sugar come through, no sweetness comes through at all. Hints of tobacco come through in the aftertaste and linger as it dries the mouth.  M- Medium body with a dry, nutty, lingering finish.  D- This is intense",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,ClevoPiwo,4.2,"poured from a bomber into a snifter.  this beer pours a light orange or very light copper color with a finger width head that dissipates after a short while with not much lacing to speak of, although it does respond well to agitation and produces a spotty film of foam that lingers throughout.  the bouquet is quit impressive and complex. the aroma is of citrus with lots of yeasty overtones that give it a grassy quality and of course hops. the grassy segment of the bouquet could be interpreted as edging on the side of a pine-y smell, as well.  the taste is balanced between the hops, the rich grassy bouquet, malts and a presence of alcohol. despite its name, this beer does not ruin the palate, the hops are not overpowering and are kept in check by the other flavors. the finish is great, leaving a dry hoppy bitterness lingering on the palate. as the beer warms up the alcohol is more present, too.  moderate carbonation lends itself to the crisp and drinkable nature of this beer. however, it doesn't detract from the satisfyingly full body and texture that coats the palate with a lingering hop flavor. despite being very hoppy and complex, this beer is drinkable.  a great beer, however, not as intimidating as the brewer might want you to believe. far from being a source of ruination for the palate, this beer should be renamed 'celebration' for the rich and satisfying experience of being able to enjoy so many ibu's while remaining refreshing.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,LiquidLord,4.17,"A - Nice orange color with a hint of red tones. Decent cream-colored head that dissipates relatively quickly, and consistent lacing throughout the consumption of a glass.  S - As soon as I smelled this, I knew my mouth was in for a wallop. Smells strongly of citrus, especially grapefruit. A slight alcoholic fume is also detectable. Very pleasant to breathe in.  T - Hops, hops, and more hops. The onrush of grapefruit/lemony flavors is immediate, with some malt and pine needle notes coming through a little later. The finish is almost saturated with the taste of hop oils and more citrus flavors. This is one constant and pleasurable assault on your senses.  M - Nice mouthfeel, as the beer is not overcarbonated and has a pleasant, medium feel.  D - The limit in drinkability comes not from the abv or body, but rather from the assault of the flavors on the tongue. I wouldn't recommend eating or drinking anything too complex after having some of this brew, as it almost numbs the tongue at times. I finished a 22 oz bottle relatively easily, but I probably wouldn't drink more than two servings at a time.  Overall, an excellent IPA that I will be consuming again in the future. Not quite as balanced as the Dogfish Head 90 min, but certainly notable for its huge flavor.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Slight raisin and green apple/pear hints.  T: Punch you in the mouth hops. Very bitter finish but a bit of malt sneaks in there at the end...or was it the middle? It's akin to eating super spicy curry, yeah there are other flavors but they struggle to make themselves known. Some of that green apple is in there...somewhere.  M: Right amount of carbination. Not too heavy, definitely full bodied though. Clean, not super clean though.  D: If you have a high hop tolerance, then hell yeah. It's so strong though, that for most, it will be a bit much on it's own.

147,4083,Newmerator,4.4,"22oz Bomber on an empty stomach!  Pours a delightful golden color, nice off-white head with a very sticky icky lace.  Fierce hops right up front and in the back. This thing is a hop sandwich from start to finish with maybe some pine malts, and citrus in the middle.  To tell you the truth, I just have too much enjoyment drinking this beer. i wanna say i can even taste some pear, but who knows... only stone.  Massages my palate. such a tasty IPA. one of my fav's.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,vrazionale,4.37,"22 oz. bottle at refrigerator temperature poured into a snifter.  A - Pours a copper body with a thin lacing of head that stays at relatively the same level.  S - Hops, naturally. Richly layered, with citrus, pine, flowers, pungent aromatics, and stone fruit all unfolding in the nose. One of those noses where a quick sniff is pleasant and appealing, but a deeper quaff rewards the drinker even further.  T - Pungent, bittersweet hops meet a sturdy malt backbone for a thoroughly drinkable brew. The finish is long, with a pleasing interaction between bitter and sweet. The citrus and pine flavors of the hops stand out the most to me.  M - Slightly sticky feel after swallowing, but I doubt that many brews with a malt presence like this can avoid that. Slight lack of carbonation, but this was likely intentional to let the hops and malt work their magic.  D - As far as DIPAs go, this is one of my favorites. Hard to taste the alcohol behind the hops and malt, but who cares. Well-layered hop profile makes every sip different and exciting. This is a feel-good brew, for those that like hops, at least! A must-try for fans of strong IPAs.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jushoppy2beer,4.15,"This is a really hoppy brew, with a complexity that is unusual for the style. It sports a nice head with good retention atop a dark amber body. Nice but simple lacing. The aroma is just slightly floral with a hint of malt. On the palate, this mouthy smooth brew starts with a nice sweetness, that is quickly replaced by the bitterness of the hops. Moderate carbonation combines with the rest to make this a robust drink. The finish is decidedly bitter hop, with a long, long bitter aftertaste. A really nice brew when you're in the mood for something to fill your senses. But, you don't want to drink too many in one sitting.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Smelled like a room full of hops/bitterness and some citrus in there too. Tastes how I want my DIPA to taste, hoppy as hell and extreme bitter, some fruit in there with that too.

147,4083,cdpike,4.43,"Bottle poured into Sam Adams sort of reverse-tulip  Pours a nice sunny golden light orange. Not a ton of foam, but that might be my fault. Nose is very citrusy with a good amount of pine and light maltiness. Not a ton up front, but still pretty full bodied. For some reason I'm having a hard time pin-pointing specific tastes except just that of a Stone beer. BIG bitterness and not a lot of alcohol sweetness. Crisp malt flavor with a LOT of citrusy pine. Tons of big bittering hops on the way down and somehow a moment later a bit of freshly milled crystal malt comes through.  The only real ""criticism"" I have for this fabulous beer is that as with most double IPAs its ""drinkability"" is still somewhat limited. The humorous writing on the back of the bottle is not kidding about ruining your palate. Don't expect to taste a whole lot in other beers for the rest of the night. Lift another Ruination instead!  As always, this beer and brewery has lived up to its name and reputation. Although still not much really need be said about this beer but that it's another gem from Stone.

Appearance - Golden orange, less dark than most DIPA's, crystal clear with a 2 finger foamy head that lasts and leaves a nice lacing.  Smell - All sorts of hops and citrusy goodness. Can smell the bitter and it tickles the nose at 100+ ibus. Small hints of straw and grass but overtaken by sweet citrus.  Taste - Bitter bitter citrus hops explode in the mouth and has a bit of a sweet kick at the end. Very very nice, all citrus no pine, but thats ok for me. Bit of grassy earthy taste at the end. Very nice DIPA.  Mouthfeel - Not too heavy, but not too light, its dry but yet satisfying, the bitter bites the tongue but it all works together.

147,4083,wl0307,4.3,"Purchased from a very good Britain-based beer shop, ""Beers of Europe"", through on-line order. Coming in a light brown, 12 Fl. Oz. slim bottle, served cool in Tripel Karmeliet's branded long-stemmed, tulip-shaped goblet; freshness info. is not provided on the bottle or the cap, btw.  A: pours an almost 100% clear, burnished dark tawny hue, coming with a few streams of fine carbonation in support of a thin, off-white creamy froth. S: the aroma is deeply flowery, juicy in the hop department yet balanced by a rich bedrock of lightly caramely maltiness as well; the hoppiness is intense, yet also rounded, full of ripe citrus fruits, sweet ripe lychee fruits, laced with random touches of sweet Osmanthus (a kind of very fragrant flower) and ripe apricots. A good swirl helps to add an extra dimension to the hop aroma, making it really really lively, dancing in the air even. All in all, a hop feast, but incredibly approachable. T: the foretaste is quite understated, featuring lightly caramely malts with an underlying bitter touch as of chopped semi-fermented Taiwanese tea leaves and old citrus peels... slowly, the bitter level goes up by stealth and, before I know it, the bitter impact has already made itself felt all over the palate, but not in a terribly lively, fresh oily/resinous hoppy way; rather, it's the ""bitter"" elements of hops that dominate here. Along with the bitter aftertaste lingers a really enjoyable and long aroma featuring pretty much the most pleasant elements any quality D/IPA could offer - flowery, apricot-ish, aromatic citric hoppiness and a lightly ""stinky"" maltiness reminiscent of fine-quality, gristy pale malts (ringing a bell of Maris Otter)... finished really dry and tannic, yet also marvellously rounded in the overall impact. M&D: the carbonation runs quietly underneath the rich hoppy flavour but the microscopic fizz does initially render a sort of bite from the back of the palate; as the beer goes, the carbonation also softens and a nice consistency b/w flavour and texture is arrived at. This balanced and delicious DIPA is not terribly complex, to be honest, but it does enjoy the best of both worlds where the depth and body of hops complement, rather than overpower, the other flavour elements on the whole. The high level of hop bitterness also camouflage the alc. strength, hence a truly, um, ""easy-drinking"" ale for Bitter lovers like me!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Goldopelgt,3.53,"A- An orange/amber color with an off-white head and some decent lacing left on the glass...  S- Hoppy, and at the same time very citrusy (mostly grapefruit but with something else in there too)...faint malts at the end...  T- Similar to the smell, but more fruity (in a good way...I swear)...good amount of hops and bitterness...  M- Somewhat thin for this style, but still very smooth...  D- A very good beer that definitely has its place in the DIPA's...but if you are expecting something over the top in the DIPA family, I would suggest something along the lines of an Unearthly, Double-dog, 90/120 Minute, Double Simcoe, etc., etc, etc....But still VERY good in its own right, and worth a try...Cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The huge pine nose is a signal to fasten your seatbelts. Puckering pine bitterness with a splash of grapefruit, maybe a touch of mint. The dry malt profile provides no mercy from the bitter assault. There seems to be a pronounced cannabis element as well. Sticky pine resin lingers in a lengthy gritty, scratchy finish. Ruination is kinda like crack; its effects are, well, ruinous, but dammit I just can't quit!  Overall impression: P#ssies take a pass on this one.

The color was paler than expected for an imperial IPA; but otherwise the beer was beautiful.  The smell and taste were earthy and bready, with hints of freshly cut grass and yeast. The flavor finished with a subtle sweetness. The feel was chewy and bitter. It was easy to drink on a hot day with a deceptively strong warming alcohol presence.  Stone Ruination IPA is a very nice double IPA that works well at the end of a summer day or with a winter meal.

A - a light amber/burnished golden w/ a thick white cap, great lace collects in rings  S - A floral citrusy grapefruit aroma w/ mild piney and lemony aroma. The nose has rind scents w/ very subtle sweet aroma accenting the citrus bounty  M - An astringent bitter feel w/ a moderately high carbonation and moderately high on the bitterness level . The sweetness is there as a backbone, but no mistake the emphasis of this ale is soley in the hops  T - An intense grapefruit rind and pine needle taste w/ a lemony accent. Spicy w/ an almost medicinal astringency and dry effect w/ alchol and hop essence giving a unified taste. Prickly w/ a nice bitter citrus and orange taste delived easily with effervescent chutzpah as it goes into the last sips w/a gentle dry malt element  D - A great double IPA true to the west coast integrity a beautifully bitter and intense beer which is probably better sampled with food.

Taste: Somewhat sweet toasted malts, citrus hops, slight pine, and very high bitterness, especially at the aftertaste. Both sweeter and more bitter than the standard Stone IPA, but less actual flavor.  Feel: Medium body, pretty smooth, exceedingly dry, moderate carbonation. Feels more like a smooth IPA rather than a DIPA.  Drinkability: Nice, drinkable DIPA, especially considering the low abv (for a DIPA).

Like grapefruit, orange zest, lemons, green apples, and that caramel malt smell that is oh so familiar with the style.  Tasty citrus flavor with a nice bitter hop bite and a mild malt caramel backbone to balance it out a bit. Could use a little more citrus flavor, but I account this to hops fading.

My dad was drinking a different, ""normal,"" IPA and this made it taste and look like a german lager...muwhahaha!!! It's truely sad that I think this is a balanced beer now.

The appearance is really copper-gold color that comes with an off-white head. The head is crisp and leaves a medium lacing down the sides of the glass.  The smell is absolutely outstanding. There is nothing else that it smells like other than straight Stone hops. It is truly amazing how great this smell is. A citrus, honey, sweet fruits smell is the greatest, along with a bitterness that stings your nostrils, but in a good way.  The taste is great great great. The mouthfeel along with the smell are an overwhelming characteristic, and when it comes together with the taste it is just hands down excitement. You can taste the bitterness all over your tongue. You can also taste the great oily hop that just coats your palate. A taste of citrus and pine, all go great together. The mouthfeel is so unique, something that only Stone can do well. It just punches you straight in the face and doesn't give you any mercy.  Now, a lot of people have a problem with how this brew is drunk. I think that it is incredibly drinkable and that I could easily drink two bombers of this, but then again I am a Stone drinker that loves getting kicked in the face.

147,4083,NewGeneric,4.42,"A friend picked this up for me in Houston. Cracked one open yesterday, poured a clear golden/bronze color with little white head, sparse lacing on the glass. Smelled of fresh hops, very citrusy, and a little piney. Tasted very citrus hoppy, mildly bitter. Well carbonated, a little dry but smooth. Very drinkable, only wish I had more.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,chilly460,4.22,"A- Excellent amber to copper color, nice full white head with full lacing  S - Huge hop aroma, pine and citrus. One of the most aromatic beers I've experienced.  T - As expected, big hop profile up front. Piney hop hits first, with a milder citrus profile. Finishes with a nice caramel malt with no harsh aftertaste.  M - Very nice, heavier bodied IPA.  D - Excellent, the malt finish holds off the bitterness enough to make drinking a few of these possible despite the very high IBU profile.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,bmcclure,4.72,"Great aroma, it's immediately in your face with citrus hop aroma and you want to drink it. When you do you are so glad that you did that you drink more and notice the great lacing, and then more and the taste blows you away. Pretty soon it is gone and you are sad, but then you are once again happy because you realize you just had one of the best beers you have ever had, and it doesn't hurt that you have 5 more in the fridge!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,davidchollar,4.45,"Looks a brilliant bronze with a medium dense white head that settles quickly but never fully disappears. A blast of that patented IPA citrus-pine smacks your nose. Digging a little deeper, as this world class ale opens up a bit, more scents are revealed. I imagine some sweeter notes, lemon cookies, fresh fruit. And, for I guess the first time ever (in a beer review), I detect hop's black sheep cousin cannabis. Yup. It's there. Sticky icky.  Taste is BITTER !!! But of course there is so much more going on here. There is a solid malt presence that is realized even as it is being blown away by the super hoppy aftertaste. The flavor is huge and unique, and it lingers. Probably medium body, but such an intensity that it seems bigger. The bitterness just keeps going, ripping away the inside of your mouth from your tongue to your gums. Intense! At 7.7% it's just at the border between not so strong and STRONG. It actually tastes a lot stronger because of the insanely enormous flavor which is still eating away at my inner mouth.  I like the diatribes and I love the labels on these bombers. Stone fucking rocks.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,joshuadlight,4.49,"Tons of reviews and tons of good reviews. For good reason. This is one great tasting ale that stands up to all the hype.  12oz bottle into a generic snifter.  Not cloudy, but not clear, this beer is a couple shades shy of being what I'd call amber. The lacing is not quite what I was hoping for, but this could be the glass. Tons of sweet grapefruit citrus in the nose. A powerful aroma fills the nostrils to say the least. It smells great! There is more pine flavors in the taste than there were in the smell. I love IPAs that establish both the citrus and the evergreen side of things. The mouthfeel is typical of a highly hopped beer, very sticky that ends very dry. It makes you know you are drinking something that is of high quality. Its dangerously gulpable, but at almost 8% abv, you'd better be careful.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,MrIncognito,4.25,"Had on tap at Fireworks Pizza in Leesburg, VA.  A - Quite hazy light amber color with a big white head. Head is sticky and tight and like latte foam and lasts for a few minutes leaving a good 1/4 inch cap all the way to the end of the beer. Wonderful lacing.  S - Very hoppy in nose. Floral hops with hints of pine and some tangerine zest. Malts come through a bit but not much alcohol.  T&M - Very creamy and smooth mouthfeel with low-moderate carbonation. Big and hoppy up front with the taste of fresh hops and light citrus. Not overly biting in the hop area which is nice, just a big kick in the taste buds. Some nice pine needles in the aftertaste but not overly sharp. The smoothness of this beer is never compromised by cloying flavors or overly sharp flavors. Nice maltiness lends to a big body. Not much alcohol in the flavor to my taste, even as it warms.  D - Scarily drinkable. I didn't know the ABV and guess that it was probably a 6% and maybe 7% at most. I was wrong - but that's how well it is masked. Wonderfully tasty and easy to drink.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The smell is strong and the hops smells are floral. Awesome smell. T: Strong taste again, but what to expect from a Imperial IPA. Again, this is mainly hops in the taste, but my palates ask for more! D: A very refreshing beer nevertheless. I drank this bottle so quickly... very drinkable.  Wow, this is one great IPA. Not too over on the citrus. What amazed me is the balance in the taste and smell of this beer. Surely I need another one for future tasting. Certainly another beer to add to my MUST BUY list!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Wutz,4.3,"Reviewed on 5-31-09.  Appearance - Ruination appears as a burnt orange but not quite as dark as ""burnt"" suggests. The head was not quite white and it provided excellent lacing down the glass (until I gave the beer another swirl - I'm a chronic swirler).  Aroma - The nose was mostly hops. Lots of floral, citrus, pine, and even a little bit of earthy business in there. It seems like Stone threw in a mixed bag of hops providing different aromas (and flavors) and I thank them for that.  Taste - After the initial bitterness shock, my palate picked up a fair dosage of malt. It seemed like it was mostly carmel malt I was tasting. Before I could even blink, the hop schedule comes back and hits me with another bunch of bitterness and flavors in much the same flavors as aromas revealed.  As another reviewer mentioned, it seems like the hops were mostly early/mid-boil additions because the aroma (a characteristic shaped by late-boil hop additions among other techniques) was quite understated in comparison to the massive bitterness and hop flavor. A little dry-hopping would balance out the aroma/flavor ratio, but I'm not sure that would improve the beer any. The understated aroma seems to help the maltiness come through.  Mouthfeel - Ruination had a medium thickness with an oily finish which seemingly coated my mouth with hops which continued to release bitterness long after the liquid had departed.  Drinkablity - I wouldn't say this is as ""drinkable"" as some of the finer American Adjunct Lagers (yes, sarcasm), but I couldn't stop drinking the hell out of it. I was trying to take my time with this beer knowing it's 7.7% ABV measurement but I couldn't help but keep grabbing my glass for the next dosage of Ruination. I'm a little dude, and knowing that (and even trying to avoid drunkeness in an effort to review this hallowed beer accurately), I couldn't stop drinking this beer. It was great and the slightly puckering finish left me wanting more (or maybe it was the incredible taste...).  Well, I'm drunk-ish but fairly happy with this beer. It was a good one to chalk up on to the list o' ""must-have brews"" board. It'll be a long time before I can get this guy again (not distributed to anywhere within a two or three states in any direction from here) but I'm super happy with the beer and I'm quite happy I went out of my way to get it when I was in an area that had it. I hope Stone can find a way to my state because this brew is special and I wouldn't be too terribly adverse to drinking this guy as often as possible.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,GarrisWH,4.37,"Poured from a bomber into pint glass.  A - Pours a rather hazy golden-orange color with about about one finger of sticky white head that retains well and leaves a decent bit of lacing.  S - Citrus hops dominate with some floral and pine tones as well. Grapefruit and pine aromas stick out the most. Very slight, sweet maltiness in the background also.  T - Sweet, caramel maltiness when it first hits the tongue, then the intense hop flavor comes through. Complex hoppiness with hints of grapefruit, pine and some floral notes as well. Quite bitter on the finish, and the bitterness lingers on the tongue, as well as some of the piney hoppiness. Definitely leans very heavily to the hop vs. malt side of things, but in a very good way.  M - Medium bodied and very resinous. Leaves your mouth feeling like coated in delicious, bitter hoppiness.  D - Very drinkable considering its 7.7% abv and 100+ IBUs. Powerful, delicious flavors that don't disappoint. Any hophead could enjoy this one. Stone never seems to let me down.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mhatters,4.32,"Served on-tap in a tulip glass at TDR Exton  Pours a coppery-brass color, with a thick fluffy head. An ""attractive"" beer.  The malt, surprisingly, is the front of this, then citrus hops and a hint of pine. Anticipation building.  The hops burst out in the flavor - the pine domintates, the citrus comes in second. The malt is fighting, but loses out to the hoppiness.  I drank 2 of these today (with a Nor Cal mixed in for fun) and if not for having to get home, could have had a couple more, a great beer with a good drinkability",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,DarbyOGill,4.23,"Poured into a Duvel tulip glass, consumed two weeks before the ""best by"" label.  A: Pours about two fingers of cream colored head. The beer itself is a nice amber color and is crystal clear. Very nice sticky lacing. Textbook appearance for a good DIPA.  S: When I stuck my nose into it the hops smacked me in the face. I get pine, lemon, and orange notes. There is also a very pleasing malty smell I picked up and a hint of alcohol.  T: Starts nice with a nice flavor of sweet malty goodness, then comes the bitterness. An explosion of hops rages across the palette. These hops carry flavors of citrus fruits and pine, as well as the intense bitterness. There is a bitter finish with a slight taste of booze.  Overall: Even with the strong hop bomb, this DIPA is pretty damn balanced due to the nice malty start which eases the drinker into the hoppy fun. The 7.7% ABV is very well hidden. Stone fails to disappoint yet again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,babaracas,4.33,"Poured from bomber, a mostly clear bright orange with creamy eggshell colored head, thick lacing. Smell: hops are on display, piney, earthy, citrus rind, candied citrus, with a soft toasted malt sweetness in the background. Taste: serious hoppiness, pine, floral, earthy, white grapefruit, tangerine, as well as toasty caramel sweet malt, that surfaces towards the end of the sip only to be beat out again by a nearly-puckering leafy, piney hop punch and lingering case of citrus-tongue. Mouthfeel: medium bodied, soft. Drinkability is off the charts for a DIPA, as the lower alcohol level, which is present only as a gradual building warmth, helps keep the focus on the hops and not on the booze.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The subtle malt undertones are represented and they do come through after the onslaught of hops takes a rest before my next sip  M - This is a serious beer and the Stoners know what they are doing. Flavor languished in my mouth for a while after every sip as this brew wants to continue 'ruining' your perception of taste as it clots your taste buds  D - I stand by the statement that I am not a fan of the IPA's. However, beers like this and the Dogfish Head 60 minute are gradually opening me up to the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,MeisterBurger,4,"Pours with a surprisingly white head, a little hazy amber orange. Had some nice chunky, foamy lacing.  Smells like a textbook American IPA: Piney grapefruit citrusy hops.  Taste is a big bitterness that hits the middle of the tongue and then starts to spread out past your teeth, then to the back of your jaw, then to your cheeks and it doesn't stop until it gets to your inner ear. My ears popped. True story. This is a piney grapefruit hop bomb for sure, but in a good way. It's unbalanced, the hops are shockingly at the forefront, but if you like bitter as much as I do you'll like this.  It's a smooth and dry mouthfeel with a lingering bitter aftertaste.  This beer is not for the feint of heart--I think you'll either love it or hate it. It's not the most complex beer, it's not balanced in that it's mostly all hop bitterness, but if you like that sort of thing then I don't think you'll find a beer that manages to deliver bitterness while still being tasty and delicious better than this.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Orange color with a short white head and nice and heavy, long lasting lacing (more than from a bottle); assertive orange citrus nose that gives way to pleasant and heavy grapefruit.  Big and appealing orange/grapefruit flavor with a big, full bodied mouthfeel and with a long lasting and pleasant grapefruit/hop finish.

147,4083,bluetravlr,4.65,"A: Nice three finger head. Good retention with tons of lacing. Great cloudy, yellow/orange, slightly amber coloration. Definitely on the cloudy yellow side.  S: Both citrus and pine show up clearly. The grapefruit aroma is matched perfectly by the pine resin. Some bread and slight caramel notes are also noticeable.  T: Very clean. 100+IBUs are not at all overwhelming. Citrus, floral, and piney notes prevail as a slight caramel backbone carries through the entire swallow. A bit of bitterness on initial tongue contact and throughout the aftertaste, but very complex and surprisingly pleasant. The bitterness definitely lingers, but for hop-heads like me this is perfect. The resins take time to settle on the tongue, but as they gather they continue enhance the hop-profile. As the beer warms caramel and pine become more defined and this beer becomes more balanced. Initially clean, this beer becomes a hop-resin bomb, coating the palate with a bitter residue. A great experience of a beer!  M: Complex. Like I said, initially the mouthfeel is clean but with continued sipping the palate gets coated with a resin-bitterness. This is easily washed away with another swig, but then the cycle continues . . . Great body. Nicely carbonated (if a tad overdone). I've never had resin stick to my teeth like this before . . . a good quality in my book.  D: The one bomber will be plenty. That being said I would love to drink one of these everyday. What a beer! Smooth, and not too bitter for a high ABV IPA. Exceptionally tasty. Resin really starts to build on the palate. This lends itself to food pairing.  Wow. It's been awhile sense I've had this brew. No wonder it's $5.99 a 22oz. A hop-heads dream. This beer is both complex and balanced, floral and piney, bitter and smooth.

Tastes like it smells, overwhelming citrusy hops, some slight bready maltines. Leaves a very bitter aftertaste which I don't mind at all. This is an incredibly hoppy beer.

Sweet malt background.  T- Wow. This truly does ruin a palate, a friend said that he wants to drink this before he takes any shots so that he tastes nothing. Huge hop taste, dominates the mouth. As it comes down there is an aftertaste of a hoppy sweet malt, fruity aftertastes as well. This came nicely to me as I realized I wasn't drinking a hop smoothie and that there was actually beer in this hop juice as well.  M- Ruined? Medium-full body, incredibly smooth. For being so hoppy I would have expected this to be a bit rougher, but to my joy it is smooth. Moderate carbonation, almost dare I say, refreshing?  D- If you hate hoppy beers you won't like this. That said for being a hop delivery device this is quite delicious. If you are looking for just an IPA this is way beyond that.

Lots of astringent lemon and grapfruit bitterness with a bready backbone that barely supports all the hops heaped on it.

I think that this bottle might not have been fresh enough to let the hops shine as much as they could. Liked it, but nothing mad it really stand out for me.

147,4083,sarahspat,2.74,"Let me preface this by saying that I have been regularly consuming hoppy beers for quite some time now, and I feel confident in my ability to judge them. And let me add that overall I love Stone and respect what they do. I just don't understand why this beer is rated so highly.  Ruination pours very clear; a tawny orange color. A decent-looking head forms, but does not stay long. Hardly any lacing.  The nose is pathetic for a DIPA. You practically have to submerge your nose to detect it at all. And it's just piney... with a hint of caramel. No complexity here.  The first couple sips were bad. Just a wave of bitterness with no complex hops flavors whatsoever. After I let it warm some more, pine and citrus flavors (mostly just pine) strengthen. I found that the bitterness was only bearable by swishing each sip around in my mouth until it was thoroughly acclimated to the temperature in my mouth. Only through these means can you appreciate that there is some sweetness to this beer, even if it's very well hidden. After the beer adjusts to the temperature of your mouth, you can pick up some candied pineapple and caramel flavors. These little flavors are the only things that save this beer from catastrophe.  The body is a little light for a DIPA, but swishing contributes to a certain creamy feel.  As for drinkability... there really is none. It took me almost 2 hours to drink 12 oz. It's just so overwhelmingly bitter, you can't help but pace yourself.  Having said all that, it's definitely not the worst DIPA I've had. But I have to disagree with the quotation underneath the logo on the bottle, ""A liquid poem to the glory of the hop."" No. I've had so many beers that are so much better at highlighting all of the deliciousness and complexity you can get from using a good variety of hops.

White, significant lacing. Visible carbonation. A very light apple cider yellow-amber in color. I smell strong, sweet malts and citrus. Only the slightest hint of hops in the nose.  The hops are strong, but there's an underlayer of those sweet notes, almost floral. Tastes almost nothing like the smell, with the exception of that sweet orange-peel citrus on the back end. I'm smelling the sweet malts and clover, and reveling in the piney hops, and the citrus binds it all together.  Medium-bodied. Carbonation is moderately strong, but works out to be ""just right."" Good drinkability for the style, but I don't really consider IPAs to be session beers.

Piney-citrusy hops even as I pour it a foot-plus from my face. It's hops-hops-hops in the nose, with a little alcohol bringing up the rear - as advertised.  Tastewise, malt is there. That's the most I can say about that particular component. Otherwise, the hops just coat the tongue and club each taste bud atop the skull. It's like whack-a-mole in there.  Noticeable but not overly-aggressive carbonation.  I would have another, but I wouldn't call this a session beer by any means.

147,4083,Mrbassjedi,4.67,"What I love about this IPA is that for people who are used to ""piss"" beer(Keystone, Bud, Coors, you get the idea), it is completely out of their league. ""Horrible"" is a word often said to me by friends who I deem worthy of a swig. One of the hoppiest beers around my neck of the woods(North Idaho) and coincidently it comes from one of my favorite breweries, Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,drunkboxer1,4.32,"Poured from a bomber bottle into a pint glass. Paired with some cheese and chips and salsa. Golden/copper color. Big rocky white head, leaves a lot of lacing. Smells like fresh American hops, like you're literally holding a bunch of them up to your nose. Big and piney. Theres a lot of carbonation. Definitely a big beer with enough malt to stand up to the hops. Fairly warming with all the alcohol. As it gets warmer you get a lot of citrus flavors, grapefruit I guess? Beats 90 Minute and Hop Wallop I think.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,zoso1967,4.27,"Pours reddish copper with less carbonation than one would expect for an American IPA. Smells predominantly of citrus. Nicely assertive hop bitterness with lots of grapefruit flavors and some grassy undertones at first, fading onto some piney notes near the end before a slightly sweet finish. A dry bitterness remains in the mouth after swallowing. Mouth feel is as one would expect from a beer of this size.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,siradmiralnelson,4.45,"Poured from bottle into Tulip.  A. Big fluffy white 2 finger head. Not much lacing left on my glass, but very nice head retention. A beautiful Orange/Apricot color.  S. One word Hops. Citrusy, Piney, Floral hops. Great Smell.  T. Taste is a hop blast. Same citrus, pine hops as the aroma. There is definitely some balance with the malt, but the hops tip the scale over the malt.  M. Rich, full. Medium bodied beer.  D. A very good DIPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,hsway,4.32,"Poured on tap into a 14 oz. glass.  a: Nice yellowy/orange color, sunlike, with a creamy off-white head and lots of lacing.  s: Citrus and pine, with a woody undertone. A bit of an alcohol twinge/esters.  t: Very hoppy, with the citrus and pine flavors supported by a grainy, toasty maltiness.  d: A great sipper, but don't think you'll be able to taste anything else with any sort of discrimination after this one. There's a reason it's called Ruination, and that's your palette after drinking it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BeerFMAndy,4.37,"22 oz. awesome looking bottle poured into an Imperial Pint. Best by date of 5/14/09  A - Ruination poured a well carbonated, brilliant clear orange amber color with a large pillowy dense off-white head. Some lacing.  S - A good combination between fruity and floral hops with a large piney citrus aroma on the nose. Some sweetness lingers in the background. A very small but detectable malt backbone too.  T - Overly hoppy in a good way with a well balanced malt nose. Pine, citrus, and a lively sweetness. As you continue drinking the malt becomes much more apparent and rounds out very well.  M - Smooth and somewhat dry, this beer is slick on the palate going down. If has a higher viscosity than any other IPAs I've had.  D - The bottle tells you that if you haven't had any IPA beers, this beer is not the place to start, and I'd agree. For a beer with 100+ IBUs it's pretty drinkable but by the end I was really sick of it. I'd suggest sharing this with a fellow hophead.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,froghop,4.17,"pours a semi-clear pale orange with a medium size egg-shell head, and good lacing.  smells of pink grapefruit, and some caramel.  taste is of grapefruit, caramel, pine, a touch of sweetness, and some citrus, ends bitter, some dryness, and tangy on the tongue.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,pwsoldier,4.67,"A - Pours a clear copper with a decent off-white head. Good retention and moderate lacing.  S - Quite a bit going on here. Hop aromas are floral, piney, and citrusy all at once, with some faint malt sweetness coming through in the background. Grapefruit and pine dominate though.  T - Very well-balanced despite the incredibly strong hop profile. A subtle malt presence keeps the tart grapefruit notes from being too harsh. There's a slight earthiness to it as well.  M - Medium-bodied with a dry finish. Understandably, there's a good amount of hop bitterness in the aftertaste that's assertive without being overbearing.  D - Probably one of the most drinkable DIPA's I've had. It's very enjoyable and the relatively low ABV makes it easy to put down a few before your palate gets weary.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Buschyfor3,4.3,"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a 16oz Sam Adams draft glass - going to take 2 for this one.  A: Pours a glorious body: a bright, golden hues around the edges of a the glass with a deeper, hazy amber-orange core; looks fiery. A thin, moderately creamy white head bubbles on top, about a finger thick, but dissipates after a couple minutes.  S: Whoa, huge citrus nose from the hops hits quickly - tart grapefruit, tangerine, fresh orange juice. I'm also picking up floral aromas - delicately sweet flowers petals, freshly chopped garden herbs and then the burst of grassy hops. The citrusy/floral punch is followed quickly a sharp pine resin. I'm not really getting much of any malt backbone in the nose - as expected, the hop character dominates here. I do, however, like the nose on this better than the standard Stone IPA - the Ruination just seems to have a bit more going on with the aromatics.  T: Initial impressions trend to the citrus side - very tart grapefruit blending with sweeter tangerine. The citrusy top note is followed closely by a delicate floral flavor (orange blossom, honeysuckle, even some very light clover honey) which quickly transitions into astringent hoppy/pine-like bitterness. Only in the finish does some maltiness sneak in, with a slightly doughy, biscuit flavor hiding underneath the lingering bitterness. Finish is slightly drying. As I work my way through the bottle, the finish starts to hint at more of a grainy, nutty malt backbone, but the balance is still firmly in favor of pungent hop bitterness. You know who rules the roost, so to speak.  M: Solid carbonation - very crisp, prickly on the tongue and even across the roof of my mouth. Cuts through the slick presence of the beer - definitely seems to have a bit more weight on the palate than the standard Stone IPA. Medium bodied seems to be an apt description.  D: Bottle says its 7.7% ABV, but I'm really not detecting that much alcohol. I never got a spicy, fusel alcohol note at any point, but probably because the citrus and pine notes really lock down the palate. However, I know the alcohol is there, and I know one bomber is more than sufficient.  Ruination is bolder than the standard Stone IPA, piling on more of the citrus flavors I find pleasing, making the beer bigger and more complex. Overall, I think I prefer the aromatics and the flavors of the Ruination over the standard Stone IPA. But keeping style in focus, if I had to place Ruination among other DIPAs, I still think 90min would get my vote - my take is that the 90 is better balanced on the palate, something that West Coast examples seem unconcerned with. Even though DIPAs/IPAs are a style I'm trying to come to grips with, I thought Stone's Ruination was a nice offering and one worth trying at least once.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,iNHaze,4.5,"22oz. into a wine glass  Pours the color of translucent fossilized amber. I got a slight head which subsided to a group of largish soapy-looking bubbles clinging to one side of the glass.  This beer smells like a bouqet of flowers. The hoppiness is intense. Made me think of marigolds and roses.  This beer starts with a bit of caramel-malty-sweetness and then slams you with floral, spicy, nuggety hops. As the hop rush is dying down I noticed a bit of citrus orange peel which is gradually replaced by a bitterish woodsy aftertaste. Also, the beer got a bit fruitier tasting as it warmed.  Mouthfeel is full and very tangy. This beer tingles on the back of the throat.  Excellent beer, I would definitely drink again. Seems like it would be especially good on a chilly autumn evening for some reason.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Nice white head that stays around a while, but nothing outstanding.  S-Wow! This knocks my socks off. What a bouquet of citrusy/hoppy aromas here. Its Ruinating my sinus passages but I'm lovin' it.  T-Hops baby! Up in front and representin'! Quite the hop bite with those citrusy notes chiming in. A bit of maltiness to boot.  M-Nice carbonation level, good medium body brew.  D-This is surprisingly drinkable for a DIPA. But don't be fooled, it is a BIG beer.  Hats off to Stone. Those guys really know how to do it!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jimj21,4.35,"Twenty two ounce bomber poured into a wine glass. Pours a bright golden color topped by about a finger of white head. The beer is a little hazy. Head retention is ok but could be better and there is a lot of lacing. Some bubbles rise in the glass. Very visually appealing.  This one smells great as well. Tons of citrusy, hoppy aroma. Grapefruit, tangerine, and maybe some tropical fruits. Also a little floral. Some malty aromas too. Lightly toasted bread and some caramel sweetness.  Fantastic all around. Starts out kind of grassy and floral. Some citrus too, but not as much as I thought there would be, given the nose. A very nice malt backbone showcased here as well. Flavors are the same as in the nose. Toasted and caramel malts. A little buttery too. Then piney bitterness takes over on the finish, along with a little alcohol bite. A bit of pine resin in the aftertaste.  Good medium body on this one. Carbonation level is great and provides for a nice creamy feel. There is some alcoholic heat from this on the finish. Not too dry though.  This one definitely does ruin your palate to some extent. However, it is delicious, and that keeps me going back for more. I don't know that I would want to drink the whole bomber all at once, but twelve ounces is about the perfect serving size. This would pair great with any spicy meal.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,infi,4.32,"Ruination. Definitely lives up to its name.  The first 2x/Imperial IPA I've tried. It pours a great translucent golden and orange color color with a white head. Ridiculous amount of citrus, pine and earthiness scents off the bat. The scent is so prevalent - it's great around the nose. Taste is full of hops and citrus. The bitterness immediately presents itself in the aftertaste. 100 IBU's is no joke, it's very noticeable. Great taste nonetheless. Drinkability is not hard, it's sippable. Try it with a burger - it's great! The bitterness shouldn't deter you from trying the beer, it's definitely worth trying and tasting!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,gameface23,4,"Pours a dark gold with a nice sized head. Nose of resinous pine and grapefruit hops. Such an intense smell. The taste had a sweet, malty start, but was decimated with a sour, syrupy finish. At times, it had an ice wine feel to it. Drinkability was average. This is another great beer by the guys at Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Thorpe429,4.74,"A: Pale orange and slightly hazed. Good white head.  S: Lots of floral hops that overwhelm the nostrils in a very good way.  T: Continuing from the nose, there is an overwhelming sense of fresh floral hops in addition to a nice bready malt base. Some citrus and tropical hops as well.  M: Medium-bodied with good carbonation.  D: Drink this FRESH. I've sampled this several times, and the fresher it is, the better it is. Fresh hops overwhelm in a good way, almost to a sweetness rather than a bitterness. An amazing DIPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,OtherShoe2,3.92,"Poured a hazy orangy gold with a small head that disappeared quickly. I had practically no lacing at all on this one, but the head may have been from an overly cautious pour on my part.  Big scent of pine and citrus rind here. Good luck finding anything else.  Big hop bite, with a nice combo of pine and citric notes. There is a little sweet malt, but it is immediately kicked into the background by some alcohol. I wish I could split the flavor rating a bit, because they get big points for the hop flavor -- but the residual tastes (meaning all that is left) seem a bit raw and out of place. but this beer is made for hop heads, and it will not disappoint.  Smooth, a bit oily, and a little flat.  Overall, I enjoyed this one. A little more fruit sweetness would have put this over the top for me. But a great brew just the same.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,kshankar,4.2,"Appearance is orange and hazy with decent head retention. Nice small head forms as well, leaves foam layer after going down. Lacing as well  Aroma is pine and citrus hops  Taste: The bottle sure isn't lying. The citrus hops and pine just jump out at you. Some of the negative reviewers point out that it seems to be nothing but hops, hops and more hops with very little balance.  I don't sense that much, even though this is a hop blast. I still get some malt backing, and the balance is okay. However, the flavor still is just...HOPS. If there were no malt backing, I'd be inclined to agree..it would just be hops and booze. But its more  Mouthfeel: Carbonated well, medium bodied  Drinkability: Um..sure. I could probably have a couple, but I think overall I prefer the Arrogant Bastard over this one. Still a very good beer though.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Great aroma of pure hops. Pine, citrus, grapefruit. A little alcohol aroma present. Very potent to the nose.  Flavor is a burst of hops. Nice bitterness with a tingly tartness of grapefruit. Somewhat peppery and spciy. I picked up a little sweetness. Alcohol is well incorporated. Aftertaste was nice as well, did not leave an overpowering bitterness after I drank it.  Mouthfeel is good with the carbonation and consistency.  Drinkability is excellent, especially for a DIPA with an ABV of 7.7.

147,4083,gciccarelli,4.32,"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass.  A - Pours a hazy pale orange with a fluffy 1 finger cream head.  S - Citrus, lots of citrus. Grapefruit, orange. Hints of pine. Very apparently hop presence, but not as overpowering as one would expect.  T - Hops hit you - they were not lying on this bottle. Sweet malt to start but then the big bitter hop presence is clearly there in the finish. Alcohol is masked very well. There is definitely a lot of citrus and hoppy bitterness, but it is not as much of a hop-bomb as one would expect (compared to the huge hype). There is actually a good amount of balance in comparison to some other super-hopped brews.  M - Medium body, low carbonation. Leaves a sweet and sticky aftertaste.  D - Considering the bitterness and ABV, very drinkable. It really honestly is well-balanced compared to many other DIPAs, regardless of the labeling. It goes down pretty smooth.

147,4083,IMincedTheKing,4.03,"Disclaimer: ""Best by 4/17/09."" Eleven days out of date.  Pours a bright, shiny orange with a big head. Great retention.  Smells a bit tea-like. Citrus hops tap dance on a bit of malt.  Lots of sweet malt character are plastered over by oily, citric hops. Either the bottle is too old, or the ""ruinous"" effect is true: the hops fell way into the background after the second sip. Lots of malt, some citrus, but nowhere near as bitter as I was expecting.  Definitely drinkable. Stone makes good beers. I'll definitely try a fresh one sometime, but even if it's a little old, I still enjoyed it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,COBeerBuff,4.5,"Picked this up on a trip to Colorado a few weeks ago. God, I wish they sold Stone beers in KS/MO.  Appearance: Pours a gorgeous hazy orange color. Not quite as clear as I expected, but this beer looks like it will have some serious flavors. A small light head that dissipates quickly leaving a thin film across the top of the beer. Very sticky lacing clings to the sides of the glass as the beer recedes.  Smell: Citrus and hops are the first two scents to gently tickle the underside of my nose. Orange peel, maybe some lemony notes. The beer definitely smells like a hop-bomb.  Taste: Holy Christmas! I'm not sure if anyone knows, but I'm pretty sure there are some hops used in the brewing of this beer. The citrus becomes very muted on the way down. The hops jump to the forefront. There might be a small amount of malt there, but then the hops come back for second and third helpings.  Mouthfeel: As my girlfriend said, it gets stronger and stronger the longer it rests on your tongue. She hates it. I love it! This is a great DIPA.  Drinkability: This beer is one of those ""Love it, or leave it"" beers. I'm definitely digging the intense hop profile. Many DIPAs play with the citrus or pineapple notes to offset the intensity of the hops. Ruination does no such thing. The hops are placed center stage, and this beer constantly reminds you of that time and again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,bamadog,4.2,"I've had this beer quite a few times and just now got around to reviewing it off a 12 oz. single that I picked up solely for the sake of reviewing it. Typically I'd prefer to buy a bomber of this and pretty much call it a night.  Appearance: Light coppery orange in color with a fluffy yet firm one finger head that is slightly off-white; Body is pretty clear and shows no carbonation; head fades to a moderately thick skim; very loose and oily lacing clings for only a second and then slides back into the beer.  Smell: Nice and citrusy from the hops - grapefruit and orange peel are present.  Taste: Nice and bitter, grapefruit and orange peel are the dominant flavors; also a fairly sweet malty backing in there as well; alcohol is masked very well.  Mouthfeel: Nice and sticky, coats heavily; there is a mild tingle as well but it must be solely from the ABV as the carbonation is virtually non-existant.  Drinkability: I love this beer and I typically drink a couple as the taste is wonderful. But I probably wouldn't go too much beyond two though as for some reason, even with the moderate ABV, it kind of kicks my butt.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,projectflam86,4.65,"A- Pours a beautiful orange color. Fluffy white foam leaves sticky lacing all the way down the glass.  S- Strong citrus hop nose. Lots of grapefruit and pine scents with lots of floral hop scents as well. Esters are present but do not interfere with the intense hop aroma.  T- Bam! The hops slam the palate with reckless force. Piney grapefruit flavor overwhelms the taste buds. The bitter flavor transforms from citrus tastes to floral and esters. The slightest hint of a caramel malt backbone is barely detectable which gives just a moment of mercy to a total onslaught of hoppy bitterness.  M- Medium bodied with just the right amount of carbonation. Smooth if you can believe it.  D- One of my personal favorites (I'm a bit biased if you couldn't tell). Never the less, truly a great brew and a must for any hophead.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,Foolmonkey,4.07,Stone Ruination really packs a hoppy punch! I'm impressed with this IPA. The appearance is a wonderful copper/amber with a 1finger head that lasts and leaves traces down the glass.  The smell is very light and pleasant with a hint of citrus and hops (of course). When drinking Ruination you really experience that bright hop taste and is rather smooth. The flavors linger and warm then finish in a bitter aftertaste which is expected.

A happy medium between the Euro and American versions. Great lacing from first sip to last though the head itself dissipates rapidly. The flavors have a great balance, from teh hops to the alcohol, etc. The best part of the beer for me is the lack of a syrupy texture. Great body, good drinkability, a hell of an IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S - Strong floral and citrus aromas from the hops, some yeasty bread smell as well. Apples were present, as well as some sharp spice. Alcohol is present on the nose, especially as it warms, but not overwhelming.  T - The malt sweetness actually hits first, followed by an intensely bitter and spicy hoppiness. I'd prefer a little more balance, but I guess the bitter hop taste is the whole point.  M - Very thick, very full, fairly sticky, and punishing.  D - Not very high, although the interesting smell and taste make it easy to keep sipping in an attempt to pick up everything present.

147,4083,ajr24,4.23,"It's as if the year is 1849 and I have struck gold. Pure, California gold. The Stone Ruination pours an intense burnt orange and gold. It looks like a sunset wearing a lot of bling-bling. The creamy, white head is like the halo atop an angel. The lacing prefers to linger, slithering down the glass at its own pace. It smells like a supernova of hops. If you inhale too aggressively, you can smell the strong bittering hops. A nice sniff will suffice for getting the full aromatic experience. The hop combination renders the alcohol in the nose somewhat weak, inferior. Columbus and Centennials join forces to create a hop combination to be reckoned with. In the words of Greg Koch, this would be an ""angry beer."" As you willingly bring the beer to your mouth, the hops begin their charge. They'll take no prisoners. And don't fight it. If you're prepared for a hoppy experience, then you and Ruination will strike an accord. The citrus hops are outstanding followed by some intense bittering action. The mouthfeel reveals the softer, more sensitive side to this beer. It's smooth, soft, fluffy, and dare I say caring? For 100+ IBUs the abrasiveness behaves itself. It's like I'm a freshman in high school all over again, and Ruination is the cool senior boy hitting on me. I wanna get as much of it as I can, but I know I must keep my distance down inside.

Although, not as intense as the description on the back label makes it out to be. I don't think this is ""ruining"" my palate as bad as they say it would but it is a bitter sweet symphony. There is a little something in the beer that separates this from another DIPA but I can put my finger on it.  This beer is surprisingly drinkable considering the high IBU's and almost 8% ABV.

D: I could have 3 or maybe 4 but this beer would steam roll me if I tried to session.  This is such a damn good IPA. It doesn't wreak havoc on the palate but that's because it's well balanced. The hops linger. It's crisp. A 6-er is far from cheap but you will be rewarded.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,LauraAlberts,4.49,"I had this at a Stone beer dinner tonight held at the Old Village Post House in Mt. Pleasant, SC. The southeast rep of Stone Brewery, Scott Sheridan attended and told some great stories behind the inception of this brew. The chef paired this beer with a Cheese Plate featuring Fiscalini, Surchoix Gruyere, Smokey Blue, Fig Compote, Candied Walnuts, & Bartlett Pear. IT WAS INCREDIBLE! I highly recommend attending any Stone beer events in your area - most definitely those held at gourmet establishments.  Appearance: Dark Amber with beautiful lacing  Smell: Ocean, Fishy, ""the sticky icky""  Taste: Everything an American Double/Imperial IPA should embody. I love this style and this beer is why.  Mouthfeel: fullbodied, dry finish  Drinkability: I'd sip and savor because this is my favorite style beer. Definitely session if you can stand it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,DannyS,3.79,"Well, I've had Hopslam and both the DFH 60 & 90 minute IPA's, this could either be my next step into hop head initiation, or something that deters me. Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into my tulip glass.  A - Very nice dark amber with a thick, pillow of bright white foam. Good retention and lacing.  S - Pine, floral, citrus. One of the best hop aromas I've ever had the privilege to smell, with an excellent malty sweet backing.  T - This is where I got kind of disappointed. It's by no means bad, but it's not as complex as I was expecting. Sure, it's got a lot of bitterness and good hop flavor, but it's just so obnoxiously in your face that the rest of the flavors have a tough time getting through. But, it does open up as it warms up. Good bit of grapefruit and smokiness, but it's a tough nugget to crack.  M - The hops leave a slight resiny, tingly feel, but the body is medium weight and the carbonation is good.  D - I seem to have a high tolerance for bitterness, so I could easily finish off the bomber, but the enjoyability declines as the bitterness continues to assault one's palate.  overall - I loved Arrogant Bastard because it doesn't talk bullshit about it being a tasty, complex brew. This one seems to complete its own mission of being an unabashed ode to hops, which I guess isn't a bad thing, it's just not as balanced or as enjoyable as their flagship brew. Whenever I braced myself with other DIPA's for the bitter hop grenade that never came, this is where it all went.  I am, however, finishing (and enjoying) the whole bomber, just out of spite. Once again, take that, Gargoyle dude!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,Fatduck,3.81,"Number 2 of my Stone IPAs.  This one is not as good as their normal IPA.  Pours a nice copper with a small, lacy white head. Nothing special.  Smells a bit grassy, not the big west coast hops I was expecting, but still nice. Taste is better than smell, lots of citrus, pine, flowery hop flavor, with a real nice clean bitterness. Smooth and creamy, a little thin for a double IPA, but that's okay. This one is a bit harder to drink, although still very good, but more than one would likely put me on my ass.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,thekanna,4.52,"4/11/09 Review:  A: Radiant amber color that just glows from the bottle and even provides a blinding brightness when poured out. A good amount of white, lacy head forms.  S: HUGE scent of hops. The typical smells associated with hops: tropical fruits, lychee, jackfruit, starfruit... it's all there.  T: I never knew using so much hops could still lead to so many layers and so much complexity. First layer has resounding notes of grapefruit and other citrus, punctured by a strong, aromatic hop note. Peels back to reveal the second layer of slightly smoky fruitiness, like oranges on a grill. Third layer hits back again with a chinese herbal medicine-like hoppiness. Not bad, just different from the first hop note. The bitterness stays with you forever if you don't cleanse your palate.  M: Nicely carbonated with somewhat of a slickness. Hops assault the tongue and leave a numbness afterwards.  D: Here's something to ruminate over. Even one taste can leave you thinking about the complexities for a long time. Great for sipping, but I don't think you can drink all that much before this destroys you and leaves all other foods/drinks unpalatable.  6/3/09 Review (somewhat a different experience than the first time I had it):  A: Deep, hazy gold bordering on amber which creates ruddy hues when held up to light. Extremely sticky, lacy head envelops the side of the glass.  S: Hop City. Huge hop complexity that has lychee and other tropical fruit overtones, with a citrus undertone.  T: Like the name suggests, causes ruination on your taste buds. Gigantic hop, evergreen, floral, and citrus taste. Bitter melon-like bitterness is omnipresent and lasts long after the liquid has been downed. Overall, extremely unique and unlike any other beers I've ever tasted (even this time, it was somewhat different than my previous experience).  M: Juiciness with a powerful sting that numbs the tongue. Bitterness lingers forever, destroying all other flavors and sensations in your mouth until only the numbing intensity remains. If your tongue was ever carpet bombed, this would be the sensation afterwards.  D: Can I just have large quantities of this instead next time I need general anesthesia for dental work? This was mind-blowing in its sheer power. While I wouldn't have this often, I will look forward to every time that I do.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BringusKilkenney,4.97,"Poured into pint glass and had a small head with a neon amber look to it very nice and inviting lightened up a bit in the light.  The smell is of apricots and hops, nice citrusy fruits and floral bouquet very nice smell. Really a great smell thoroughly enjoyed this beer.  the taste is excellent great smooth hoppy flavor with apricots in back ground. Long lasting bitterness after taste. The mouthfeel is great smooth with a little carbonation medium bodied. I could drink this all night very easy to handle and just down right enjoyable this is probably one of my top 10 especially in the IPA or double ipa style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,cnally,3.89,"really cloudy mix of brown and amber. sap from a tree. whitish head with good lacing.  wow, hops. the scent is all hop. slightly sour bite in there.  god, I know this is supposed to be hoppy. but ny god, it drowns out all other aspects. barely noticeable aspects of orchard fruits. an absolute hop bomb.  really dry feel, obviously. but not as much as you might expect.  this is liquid hops. I have enough of an understanding of what I like to desire multiple aspects and qualities to a beer. some balance, maybe. and there is no balance here. it is hop, straight up, no exceptions.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Duhast500,4.72,"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass.  The color is a slightly cloudy yellowish gold with a white foamy head.  The smell has a strong hop flavor, some citrus and alot of piny hop flavor.  The taste is a bit strong. A surprise a bit to the taste buds. The hops slide over the tongue and really kicks with spicy hope feel. Some citrus flavor in the background as well.  The flavor comes right to the front. Like most Stone beers you can not ignore the taste of their beers. IMO the straight forward strong flavor of the beer looses a slight degree of drinkability. It ends up being worth the trade off. The pallete does take a second to get used to the hop explosion but once it's up to speed, you enjoy it all the more.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Andreji,3.97,"Ruination IPA is definetly another american tribute to hops.  pour is an orangey golden tone quite transparent with a light tan head that dissipated fairly quickly and leaves poor lacing.  Smell is definetly the best part- a combination of orange with perhaps some celery, some sort of a tangy feel back there.  but the taste is overwhelmingly bitter, however there is a citrusy tangy feel at first- sort of like drinking an overhopped tripel, which for me is nice, because i love tripels and am starting to appreciate hops.  but still, couldn't take too many of these at a time. nice beer, nonetheless.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BARFLYB,3.58,"10oz serving at Union Jacks.  A- Nice burnt orange with golden spots and a thin white head always on top. The foam also had some legs and sticked leaving a mess on the glass. Some slow rising bubbles while a bit cloudy looking through the glass.  S- Ruination woke me up. Big scents of strong hops from top to bottom. More on the bitter side with not alot of backlay from any malts, (Is there any here?) Reminds me of a triple IPA. Some citrus with the usual characters. Any alcohol is soaked up by the hop punch to the nose.  T- And another punch to the whole palette in general. The hops open like a flood gate rushing and somewhat ruining any senses. Bitter pine sap with an intense way about itself. Some relief from the malt 1/2 way in this serving. Would like more deep citrus flavor.  M- It just explodes, the hops rule, there is no turning back. A medium bodied mouth with a whole lot of bitter bite. Some malty sweet spots here and there with carbonation. This one is a monster and kills.  D- Bring water. 10oz was good enough for me. I could not imagine polishing off a bomber of this. Small sips were needed as I got through this. Not my favorite but far from the worst. I knew what I was getting myself into, which is key when ordering this one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,aglose45,4.45,"A: Lighter gold, straw-like color. Head was as close to white as possible.  S: Smell is orange zest up front, with some biscuit-like malts and a bit of pine as well.  T: Taste is pretty much on point with the orange zest and pine. The hops overpower the malts, obviously intentionally, but there are some biscuit/bready malts that attempt to cut into the hoppy bitterness.  M: Great; syrupy and sticky, lasts a bit longer than the beer itself. Excellent carbonation.  D: Given the abv, I could drink this all night long.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,LieutenantWort,4.54,"One of my all-time favorite beers. This tasting report is from a 22oz bomber, poured into an imperial pint glass:  The beer pours an orange/amber hue, dense enough to have solid color at the center of the glass but not as deep as a red ale. Decent head, about two fingers, somewhat frothy and leaves a lot of lacing on the glass as it goes down.  Smell is amazing. Candied citrus and floral notes, hops that smell like ginger.  Taste follows the smell. Very crisp and smooth. Hoppy, but not bitter. I know the IBU's on this beer are very high, but honestly Guiness will curl my tongue before the Ruination does. I suppose if I had three bombers that hops would certainly pile up, but at two or three pints the yeast and sweet notes balance the hops very nicely.  Speaking of which, drinkability is excellent as long as I'm not having more than a couple of pints an hour. More than that and the hops do start to pile up and ""turn"" the beer for me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,joepais,4.15,I poured a bomber into my pint glass and it produced a two finger white head that settled to a thick lace. The body of the brew was a clear golden-orange in color.  Huge aromas of hop's floral and citrusy fill your head. The flavor is hugely piney and bitter citrus. This one is oily and slick feeling in the mouth. It really is hoppy but it is drinkable.  I easily put away the bomber I don't know if I could drink more than one at a time but I suppose it would be great with buffalo wings.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,raoulduke37,3.83,"OK, I'll admit it, I didn't have high hopes going into this one...I'm yet to develop my Stone palate, if there is such a thing, but keeping in respect with the style and the brewery, here goes...  This beer pours a very beautiful orange color - not too clear, but not very dense either - it looks extremely appetizing, with an slightly off-white head that rises just over the brew - some decent lacing as well. It smells of pine, other citrus, and wood cleaner all mixed into one - still surprisingly good. What I really like about this Stone brew, as opposed to the standard IPA, is that it waits a moment for the bitterness to kick in - it lets you enjoy the citrus, hops, and especially the grapefruit before kicking your ass with the bitterness. I have to say that I'm actually enjoying it. The lingering mouthfeel, however, doesn't appeal to me all that much - bitter stickiness on both sides of the mouth and with the high carbonation makes it a little much to handle.  All in all, one of my better liked Stone brews, with plenty of positives, and only minor imperfections.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,3Vandoo,4.5,"The first time I tried the ruination the bottle was more than a year old and let be honest the hops faded a bit.  so now, I had a fresh bottle in my hand and I said let's drink it, even if I'm stuck with a cold.  Golden amber orangish in color, my glass the head let iself die very quickly leaving just an oily lace, while the other glass there was an indeed very nice head.  smell is bitter, hops, hops and more hops, citrus, piney, pinneapples and a tiny hint of caramel.  Taste is a nice kick in the face, the bitterness hits you right away followed by the citrus, piney aromas of the hops, not shy in mouth, no bitterness aftertaste, just a sweet like malty flavor that comes in and seems to balance everything out.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BoitSansSoif,4.13,"A-Deep reddish-copper amber w/great lacing and frothy off-white head, nice retention, and good lacing.  S-Fresh malt, floral hops, hops, and more hops. Lots of resiny pine notes, citrus, and a bit of mineral.  T&M-Nice fresh malt backbone despite the bold hops. Resiny mouthfeel complements prickly carbonation and moderate body.  D-Excellent drinkability. The light nature means teh alcohol is deceptively well-hidden. The taste is also extremely clean, as I find to be a common feature w/Stone. The water they use is high-quality.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,LordAdmNelson,3.83,"So here's the thing with this one. I tried a Ruination shortly after I began reading BA (I wasn't a member yet) and I thought I could handle it. I knew I wanted to like it--people seemed to love it. I just couldn't do it though. Ended up being a drain pour for me (sadly). After letting my palate mature a little more, I'm excited for this one. Poured from a bomber into one of my favorite glasses.  A- Looks like a solid IPA-- Golden-orange with about an inch and a half of foamy head. Good retention. Laces nicely.  S- Lots of hops--mainly grapefruit and pine notes. Strong and delicious. A little malt background, but faint. I could smell it as soon as I opened the bottle.  T- Good, but not necessarily as good as I wanted it to be. The aroma hops in the nose give way to a blast of bittering hops (I guess I should expect this from 100+ IBUs). Slightly puckering in the beginning, but better as I go along. Lightly roasted malt in the background but very faint. I can't believe how much more drinkable this is to me now than it was when I started craft beer-ing. Leaves a piney aftertaste, slightly dry.  M- Medium to light bodied, a little creamy. Not bad for an IPA.  D- I could have the whole bomber, sure (this time around!), but I couldn't have much more of it. I'm kind of afraid my poop is going to smell like Pine-Sol tomorrow...  All in all, a good beer. Not so sure I'm a huge fan of the hop profile--I tend to like a little sweeter IPA. Definitely one to remember though.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Imsothirsty,4.52,"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass to share with a buddy.  Pours a nice rusty orange with about a finger of thick head. I am uneasy about giving a 5 but the smell is phenomenal. A thousand hop ""flavors"" that make up the aroma cause instant salivation.  Taste: Bitter, and tangy, refreshing and hoppy, mainly piney hops followed by citrus and fruity and then more bitter.

147,4083,joerodiii,3.7,"Slightly cloudy light amber with moderate head. Strong hop aroma including grapefruit, pine notes, and generic citrus.  Taste is overwhelmingly hops with a hint of sweetness. Up front there is a strong bitterness that gives way to a strong sense of grapefruit. That is followed with a moment of sweetness, then like a punch in the face, the rest of the bitterness rolls in and lingers long after swallowing.  I know this is exactly what the brewer was going after, but I would have prefered more hop flavor and less hop bitterness.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,youngblood,4.39,"This was the beer that got me hooked on DIPA's. This has a decent appearance to it. Bright amber color with stark white head atop. Very strong bitter hop scents, mostly pine coming off this. Again, the hops take over the flavor with this one, killing whatever sweetness the malt had in mind. If you are a hop lover, the piney aftertaste will love you long time. Nice mouthfeel, rather light. Drinkability is high due to lower ABV (for a DIPA at least).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Tried alongside Maharaja, this has a more varied nose - somewhat less citrus, a little more pine. Taste follows the nose, with the hops kicking ass in the forefront. Compared to the Maharaja, very little malt backing, so this is more of a puckering hop assault. Feel is downright light for a DIPA, making this dangerously drinkable. Alcohol is on the light side for this style, further adding to drinkability.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,dasenebler,4.52,"From a bomber this beer pours a hazy amber-orange, very similar to the standard Stone IPA. Nice and sticky, off-white head. Huge aroma of floral hops, medicinal notes, and some alcohol.  This is a very citrusy, dry and bitter beer, but not overpowering like some other imperial IPAs. There's some biscuity malt, but this thing is all hops. The mouthfeel is incredible, very smooth and resinous, with low carbonation, which I love. Very lemony and puckering overall, but not too heavy and pretty drinkable. Alcohol is somewhat apparent. Enormously bitter aftertaste.

The colour of the beer is golden/light copper colour The beer come across as quite bitter with some notes of alcohol at the end, but there is a strong citrus flavour in the background. The beer is incredibly balanced even with the huge bitterness. The pale malts of the beer come through slightly, but there isn't much there. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, so it fits well. The beer is probably the most drinkable IIPA, I've ever had. It's so smooth and subtle, but complex. Great tasting ale, but it needs more hop complexities. It's an all centennial beer, so it tastes great, but it's just lacking a bit of punch in the hop department (I know it sound weird to say that for an IIPA, but I like the complexity of mixed hops!)",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Just a small white head that trails down the glass.  The smell is all floral hops and wonderful.  Taste is nice and bitter. It may be the same color as a beer like Pliny but it is much more bitter. A nice hop aftertaste and some lingering hop bitterness. Not much of the floral aspect of the hop but that was not what I wanted today.  Mouthfeel is thick and resiny. It stays in your mouth after the sip and reminds you that you just had an excellent beer.

The smell that is there is pleasant, but I have to really stick my nose into that glass to get anything.  T--I don't get much at first but after it is in my mouth for a moment a very strong grassy/bitter hop taste comes to the forefront. A lingering bitterness overpowers anything else I get out of this.

147,4083,hoppyhobby,4.4,"I can find this one in bottles locally, but I was lucky enough to try this one on tap as took advantage of a chance to visit the Stone Brewery in Escondido, Ca while on a business trip, and we also did the tour. Ruination was one of the tastings as a part of the tour but we also had a couple at the Bistro after the tour.  A - Pours to a small head, and it has a wonderful light orange body with great lacing.  S - Grapefruity hops disseminates from this wonderful ale as it's loaded with hops. Our brewery tour guide told us that a single Ruination has a much hops as eighteen normal beer so you can definitely get your hops fix on this one.  T - The taste is not far from what you get out of the aroma. This is what you would expect from an excellent IPA. Some bitterness but not biting. A lasting after taste that makes you savor each sip.  M - Clean and crisp.  D- A very drinkable ale that I usually reserve for celebrations as it's a bit pricey, at least it is in our area.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,SpinachEater,2.44,"The workers at my local beer and wine store rave about Stone beers. I am a huge double IPA lover and go out of my way to try every IPA that my local stores carry. This is my honest opinion of this brew in comparison to all other double IPAs that I have tasted.  Appearance: After pouring into a glass I was struck at how pale the color was and how effervescent it became. Besides the clarity, the thin head also indicated a light bodied beer. It was quick to foam but also quick to settle leaving almost no webbing on the glass wall at all. As I was drinking, webbing never quite appeared on the glass.  Aroma: The aroma was correct, prominently hoppy, but lackluster. The bouquet of hops was there and in plenty but wasn't as aromatic and crisp as other high quality double IPAs. This indicates a one dimensional hop selection. Typically, one has to balance their hop selection of aromatic hops to high alpha-acid hops and I don't feel as if Stone did this well.  Taste: The taste was what I expected form the appearance and I was disappointed. The beer is very nicely hopped but has no body or malty balance what so ever. It instantly had me thinking of what a Rolling Rock might taste like with a magnitude of hops. The quality of hops was not that impressive to me either. They did not taste fresh and crisp but rather dull with a powerful bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Quite lite and effervescent. I like to think of this brew as the champagne of double IPAs.  Drinkability: It is light and easy to drink.  Overall: This beer is not In the league of Bell's Hopslam, Victory's Hop Devil, or Hebrew's RIPA. Ruination just doesn't compare. To me, it tastes like an amateur's attempt at a double IPA who had a small budget and wanted to get the highest IBUs as possible. I feel like Stone's only goal was to create a brew with a high IBU count. They seemed to skimp on the aromatic hop selection and completely avoid a malty support as if to trick the drinker into focusing on the bitterness. This beer lacks the complexity and balance that I like to have in a double IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BarrelO,4.1,"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass.  A: Light orange with a miniscule head that leaves plenty of lacing.  S: Hops, hops, hops. Hops in all their piney, grassy, citrusy glory.

The malt only really serves as a delivery vehicle for the hops.  M: Much lighter than most DIPAs. Almost like a pilsner.  D: Another winner from Stone. How is it that such an uncompromising hop assault is almost sessionably drinkable? I wouldn't turn down a 90 Minute or a Hopslam for one, but that's no knock against it. If you're jonesing for hops, look no further.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,gabe23,3.87,"A - Hazy golden color with a rocky white head & copious lacing.  S - Earthy aroma of citrus and grass. Actually somewhat mild compared to many DIPAs.  T - A slight touch of sweetness up front, but the piney, grapefruit bitterness takes over and doesn't let go. Not much in the way of balance here, but what do you expect with a name like Ruination?  M - Full, thick body that clings to the tongue. Carbonation is mild to medium.  D - If face-numbing bitterness is your thing, I guess you could drink it all night long. For me, I enjoyed a bomber, but that was plenty. This beer is something of a legend & it's worth a try for that if nothing else. But I'd had other DIPAs that I liked a lot more.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Deuane,4.3,"A bottle from my cellar that has a little age on it and is begging to be imbibed.  A-Slightly hazed, Dark golden amber with a medium off-white head that reduced a bit and left copious, sticky lace.  S-Strong dose of sweet caramel malt up front. Not a real surprise as this bottle has aged a bit and the hops have fallen off. With a bit of warming a fairly strong citrus and spicy pine bitterness emerge.  T-Even with the loss of the hop pop this is still a damn tasty brew. Good dose of malt sweetness up front is followed by citrus rind bitterness and spicy pine.  M-Medium body with good smoothness and lingering hop bitterness.  D-Even a bit long in the tooth this brew still deserves respect. While the hops dont pop quite like they do when fresh the balance simply shifts to the malt side. Still plenty of hops....just not as bright as they use to be. I surely will not have any trouble finishing this bomber on my own.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,cracgor,4.73,"Amber color, nice cakey head. Very fruity smell that mimics the taste. Strong ester that tastes a bit like berries, completely hidden alcohol, good balance with the malts.

147,4083,Florida9,4.4,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass.  Three fingers of thick, but somewhat foamy head. Head was quite stable and about an inch of it stuck around the whole time I was drinking the beer.  Color is a slightly hazy light-tan to golden.  Nose is grassy, spicy hops with a note of grapefruit.  Flavor is dry. No malt sweetness. Really just enough malt to provide a backbone for the bitter hop finish. Bitterness develops nicely after swallowing.  Mouthfeel is actually quite light.  Good drinkability. This beer has a great flavor, and while there is an assertive hop flavor, it is not overdone by any means. This is truly one of my favorite beers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Wow that is one hoppy smelling beer: Perfumey, floral smell is the most prominent.  T. Hops come through strong, very floral and a little citrusy. Malts are picked up on after a few sips, initially the wonderful hops dominated my taste buds. And as the bottle says this beer really kills your taste buds, in a good way I think.  M.

All sorts of citrus, herbal, and grassy hops. Hops done exceedingly well with lots of complexity but the malts don't show up for the party to add depth.  3.5 M: Lacking the creaminess I want in a DIPA.

Head retention could be a bit better. S: Nice bouquet of floral with a sweet pine aroma in the back. T: Smack of bitter hops is most present on the palate; herbals and florals that are expected in a DIPA. A yeasty/doughy flavor weaved throughout. As the beer warms, the bitters die down significantly and the perfumey hope flavor dominates. M: Medium body with a huge perfume residue clinging onto the palate after each sip. D: The head needed a somewhat aggressive pour to create. Could have used a bit more citrus to balance out the heavy floral/perfumey flavors. Overall a good DIPA, but nothing overwhelming.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Flavor was moderate bitter with a bittersweet finish of long duration. Medium to full body with a oily texture and soft carbonation. Moderate alcohol bite at the finish. Very good brew.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BigIrishman,4.55,"Appearance: Very clear orangy amber with a nice creamy/soapy head to it, tons of lace.  Smell: Perfume-hops dominate this aroma, a bit floral in nature but there is this definite herbal/earthy undertone that is absolutely making me want to down this immediately.  Taste: There are pletty of really flavorful hops in here that really explode in your mouth, very similar to the great aroma. There is even a bit more of that piny/earthy undertone that gives this brew so much depth.  Mouthfeel: Medium body that seems to just stick in your mouth.  Drinkability: Absolutely awesome, although drinking anything after this under 80 or so IBU's would be completely wasted. This creates absolute havoc on the taste buds.  Notes: Stone has been my favorite overall brewery for some time now. I keep thinking that I just need to experience more breweries out there, and I won't be one of those cliche Stone guys. But they keep me coming back and never ever ever disappoint. Guess I am one of those guys, and proud of it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,CrossansWright,4.18,"This is my first official review, so please bear with me. It poured a beautiful golden, wheat color with a nice two-finger head which eventually led to some absolutely stunning lacing. The smell was mostly hops, I sensed much a lot of pine, but also some nice citrus. I was so excited when I got my hands on this beer that I pretty much completely forgot to note the mouthfeel, but the overall experience was great and I remember a kind of thickness that I really enjoyed. The hops were almost overwhelming right off the bat and the bitterness that they brought hung around almost indefinitely. There was citrus followed by a nice malty afterglow. This is a beer that deserves to be enjoyed sip by sip; absolutely delicious. I'm sure I will be coming back to this beer in the future. In other news, I find the curvy brown bottles that Rogue, Stone, and some other West Coast breweries use is the sexiest bottle out there. It's curvacious, just like a good woman should be. Also, I find Stone's paragraph long descriptions/rants to be incredibly witty, arrogant and appealing. Great experience, great beer!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,atsprings,4.33,"On-tap at Woody's City Market, served in a standard pint glass a nice crisp orange with beautiful frothy head. Aroma is crisp citrus hops and some sweet malts. The taste is wonderful balance of citrus hops and sweet malts in the initial that quickly turns over to loads of hops in the finish. The beer is medium bodied with nice smooth carbonation. This has been one of my favorite Double IPAs, and it certainly doesn't miss on draft.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,HalenRush,4.3,"A - Pours a nice head that sticks around a while. I had a thin, bubbly head throughout the glass. Color was a hazy straw. A little light on the SRM's for an IPA  S - A clean lemony-spice  T - I liked this IPA a lot. Very tasty, clean, and hop character wasn't overbearing. Hops were the showcase, but not the overall presence.  M - Clean and very crisp for an IPA also very well balanced.  D - I had a bomber, and it went straight to my head. Yeah, I wanted much more, it was very drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,TequilaSauer,4.37,"Beautiful, foamy head with light lacing. Nice amber color, not as thick as the taste would lead you to expect.  Smells of fresh, wet cement and citrus.  Attacks with heavy grapefruit and malt that immediately shifts into a hoppy, bitter overdrive as it goes down. The finish is VERY bitter with a leafy, vegetal linger. It really sits there on the palette long after the swallow and refuses to be tamed. As the flavors fade, bitterness becomes almost the only note left on the tongue. This is an anti-hophead's worst nightmare.  Incredible delivery and potent hoppy flavors make for a slightly unbalanced, yet VERY enjoyable beer. The flavors are VERY defined, and if you don't enjoy that style, this will be your worst enemy. Drinkability suffers a bit due to the intense finish that almost demands slow consumption.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S: Hops and hops: earthy, citrusy aromas with hints of herbs and a rich, fruity, bready malt backbone.  T: Extremely bitter. Flavors are earthy, pungent and overpowering. The fruity malt backbone is almost an afterthought. Bitterness lingers with flavors of oily, resin-like hop juice.  M: Medium to full bodied. Oily and slippery. Carbonation is fairly mild.  D: You're either ready for this one or you aren't. It's certainly a palate-wrecker, but can be quite quenching on occasion. If you're prepared for this beer, it's a world class hopped-to-hell IPA. If not, you may be overtaken by your glass.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,bsend,4.63,"Shared a 22 oz. bomber in two separate pint glasses.  The pour looked good from the start. There was a deep rich color (picture a hazy orange) with a decent, noticeable head. From the start the beer looked very appealing.  The smell was rich with hops. Heavily scented, but not over bearing.  The taste proved to be one of the best. A hoppy IPA that was high on flavor. It was tangy, bitter yet sweet, and well balanced. Rather low alcohol at 7.7% made this particular IPA light and refreshing.  The mouthfeel was decent. The light carbonation played well on the tongue, and was a fine example of what other beers should feel like upon each sip.  The drinkability was outstanding. I could easily drink this beer every day and not even think twice about it. The light alcohol flavor made it feel even (slightly) lower than the 7.7%. Wonderful on all levels.  Final Thoughts - One of the best brews I have had. Price is the only thing holding me back from drinking this one again and again. Definitely worth the money though. Grab a bottle and find out what its like.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Almost two inches of nice foamy head. It's really a great looking beer.  Smell - Lots of hops! Plenty of grapefruit up front. Plenty of pine follows. It's like an awesome bouquet. Nice sweetness.  Taste - Pretty good. It's a little too mellow up front. Then it follows with that hop stickiness. It really sits on the tongue. Making the follow quit bitter, and astringent. Not terribly pleasant.  Mouthfeel - Not bad. A little thin, and then the sticky hops just sit.  Drinkability - The follow is rough. It's so bitter and just downright unpleasant. It's still a nice beer, but I almost have to prep for the next sip.  The balance of this one is just off. It smells awesome, but the first taste is not much.

A- Medium orange with a thin off white head that remains though-out the whole beer. Leaves heavy lacing from top to bottom of the glass.  S- Smells great like a summers day with the fresh cut grass aroma in the air. Some malty hints as well.  T- Taste is golden with a hop hit as soon as you sip it. On the regular drink it is very refreshing if you have not had a good drink in a while. Citrus and floral notes are there.  M- Smooth and easy is all i can say. GREAT! Rolls over the taste buds as it was ment to be there.  D- Drinkability is excellent and easy to have many. Be carefull high alcohol content!!,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Drinkable beer but very bitter & alcohol can sneak up on you.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,AdmiralDiaz,4.5,"Poured from 12oz bottle to pint glass.  A: Pours just a slightly hazy orange color with a nice large off-white head with great retention that becomes very rocky and ends up leaving some nice spiderweb lacing.  S: Smells pretty bold grapefruit and hops with subtle complexities of some caramel and floral scents.  T: Smell is a good indicator of this one. Strong grapefruit peel all throughout the drink, bitter from start to finish, but not too bitter as to bring down the drinkability. Floral hops along iwth some other citrus notes. There's a bit of a caramel flavor hidden in the strong hops.  M: What you expect for the style, good level of carbonation and a bit of an oily mouthfeel. Can't say it was perfect but really nothing wrong with it.  D: For the bitterness and style it's quite drinkable. The alcohol is fairly low for a DIPA and doesn't come out at all in the drink. This is a great beer from Stone pick it up.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

First sip is nice an hoppy, but then ends quite bitter. The bitter stays in my mouth and lingers. Not sure if this is a beer for me. I love hops, but this seems to have distinct bitterness that I don't seem to like. It gets a little better as it warms up. The bitterness tends to fade. I'm glad I tried it, but not sure how many I could have in one night.  PS. It is one of the coolest bottles, I love the etched gargoyle.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,JJBlanche,3.85,"I'll preface this by saying Stone is one of my favorite breweries, but I much prefer the 90 minute IPA to this offering. As some other reviewers have said, after all the hype I came away from Ruination thinking ""is this it?""  A - Golden/tan/beige, depending upon the light. Small head, but it sticks around. Good for the style, can't complain.  S - Quite good. Hops (big surprise). Centennial's floral notes -- I prefer the fruitier Cascade, but still, again, quite good.  T - I really had a ""meh"" reaction to this beer. Grassy/celery notes a big part of the profile. Note that I'm not referring to bitterness and/or hop flavor, which I love, but an off-putting taste that is a result of either Stone's hop choice, method of hop infusion, or both. Certainly not anywhere close to bad, but at the same time I really don't feel it deserves the raves it's been getting.  Malt present, although perhaps not to the degree of 90 minute. Perhaps a darker crystal would have improved things, but then that may have nudged it out of style.  M - Appropriate for the style. Can't knock too much of anything in this regard.  D - Good, but suffers somewhat from the aforementioned funk.  A quality beer, lovingly produced -- but I can't see myself buying this one again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Warm on the way down. Nice tingle. Moderate body.  D - I love this beer, but if it has a fault, it is here. I don't think one could drink a bunch of them, but afterall - that's not what it is made for.  Overall - You have to practice to like this one.

Taste - it is a palate killer - very bitter and hoppy, grapefruit faded now it is mostly pine. Well this is probably my first palate killer and it's interesting. Very dry finish. Rich and creamy. Well I can't complain about the bitterness, it ment to be this hoppy and it's brewed very well.

Quite a bit of hops but still some malt presence. Overall, despite the freshness of this beer, The nose is a bit underwhelming.  T- Starts out with a bunch of tart grapefruit and pine notes with a bit of malt hiding underneath. The the finish is quite dry and semi-astringent. Nice long finish.  M- Low carbonation works well. I like the very dry-astringent finish.  D- This is a nice hop bomb, but just seems simple to me.

147,4083,herbalist,4.5,"A hop lover's dream! This beer pours a perfect golden color with a light hint of orange to it. The head is extremely light in color, an off white, that is almost two fingers thick. It sticks around too and leaves a nice white lace behind.  It smells of fresh hops with a nice piney, slightly yeasty aroma. It does not have the overwhelming citrus scent to it that a lot of other American IPAs have. It seems more earthy and slightly floral. While the malt is there it is very hard to pick out.  As far as taste goes this is a delicious beer. A very complex flavor would be the most appropriate way to put it. Upon the first sip you get a nice almost caramel malt flavor before the hops become dominant. It is almost like your mouth explodes with hops leaving a nice citrusy-piny blend that is very enjoyable. It is the perfect amount of bitterness. Not too overwhelming but enough to let you know that you are drinking an IPA done right.  The mouthfeel is very nice. Medium-bodied and a little more carbonation than expected but it compliments the complex flavors nicely. I think the carbonation has something to do with why the bitterness of the beer is not overwhelming.  I def. can drink this beer as much as I can afford it. It is probably one of my favorites beers altogether and certainly one of my favorite IPAs. I would give it all 5s but I figured I'd save that for the rare occasion I might find something I like more. An excellent beer overall.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,TLove,4.12,"I must say, after drinking the Bell's Hopslam, the Harpoon Leviathan IPA, and this in three successive nights, this is certainly the hoppiest of the three.  The color doesn't tell much of a story and the head is very thin and clear. Hops are admittedly the most prominent character to the smell and body, however the beer is superbly balanced, with light snippets of sweet honey and malt to the taste.  The initial taste is deceivingly warm and caramely, but the hops come back to bite through the finish and remain lingering on the tongue for longer than expected, sometimes a full 30 seconds after a big sip.  A standout among extreme beers with extreme hop character for its simultaneous harshness and its subtle charms.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jettjon,4.45,"From a 22oz bomber with a lot of writing I am temporarily ignoring, but with no visible freshness marking, into my cervoise. It's a bright, clear golden honey color, capped with a thin head of white foam and a bit of clingy lace. There's a very small amount of precipitating carbonation; otherwise not much going on carbonation-wise. Nose of distinct ruby grapefruit, at once sweet and bitter with clean citrus hops and lemon rinds. Bready with candy-like caramelized sugar sweetness. On the palate, it's not as punishing as the hype had lead me to believe. Rather, it's cleanly hopped with the flavor delivering on all of the nose's promises. Crisp with biting citrus hops. Hints of malt and caramel sugar hold it together. Alcohol is definitely there but it's not overpowering. Mouth is lightly viscous, perhaps a bit thinner than I'd have liked, yet certainly crisp and refreshing. Yes, I use the word crisp a lot here, and there's a reason for it. Drinkability is deceivingly good; it's an easy drinker though no doubt potent.  Overall: A very solid Imperial IPA, good citrus character, clean, crisp mouthfeel, and good overall drinking experience.

As it warmed, there was a strong herbal/unsweetened tea flavor.  M - good. normal for an IPA.  D - I don't like DIPAs. To me, anyone can make an exceptionally hoppy beer.

147,4083,Magpie14,4.57,"A: radiant golden colors with light yellow edges, even some pale orange hues in the mix. This was topped off by an ""almost"" bleach white head with patches of dense lace, as well as a random plastering of blobs and speckles. The color is rather light and fascinating in some regards  S: plenty of little greeny bombs in the nose. Fresh pine saplings, spicy, fruits, and the whole shebang. Tasty hops forge a presence through the nasal passages as well as a dainty caramel sweetness  T: huge hops, sweet, sticky, and what more could you ask for. An even showing of malts and yet, they never get in the way of the almost raw 'n' spicy hops character. Hops do stick a good fixing on the taste buds: pine, lemons, apricots, and oranges with a soft unique dirty-woody character after a few large gulps. However, I would say that the bitter pine character sits at the throne in the hop court. And, yet again, I must mention the subdued caramely toasted malt flavors, although hidden, are in fairly good order  M: a lusty finish that is never ""bitter overkill"" as some monster IPA's. Mouthfeel has a mild and even feel with soft buttery-like finish. For what this beer is, the body is very complimentary  D: a one word summary: marvelous.

Grapefruit, floral, and piney hops mixed with tropical fruit. The tropical fruit and hop medley complement eachother well and make me think of lush island beaches. There's light biscuity malt under there somewhere. Mild bitterness considering ""100+ ibu(s)."" Piney hops become more dominant as Ruination warms.

147,4083,Vonerichs,4.74,"This has got to be the perfect beer. Honestly, I wouldn't change a thing about it.  Pours a clear golden-orange with a strong thick head that lingers. The bubbles dance and rise for a couple minutes.  Pungent odors of all kinds of hops, it seems to cover them all from pine resin, fresh grapefruit, to floral notes. There is only a slight caramel malt that brings you back to reality, but only for a brief moment, then another onslaught of hops.  The taste is perfection. As soon as it hits the tongue there's a brief moment of a sweet, fruity apple-like ester, then the hop-attack begins. The pine is the first thing I taste, followed by the bitter grapefruit finish. The citrus finish hangs around forever and makes my mouth pucker up, and it's welcome to stay as long as it wants.  Nice thick, chewy, resinous, and just the perfect amount of carbonation. For as bitter as this is, everything just feels fresh and it leaves a very clean taste in the mouth. It gives the tongue a very enjoyable beating, true to it's name.  I can drink this all day and night. Admittedly I am a hop-head and this is by far my favorite IPA. This isn't distributed in Illinois and I have to go out of my way to get it, but won't ever pass on the opportunity to do so.

After the first sip, which just kicks the crap out of your mouth with a flavor something resembling a cut pine tree, the taste mellows out alot more. Very smooth hoppy citrus flavor with a strong malty backbone. If the malts weren't so strong, i would think that I would be disgusted as it would be chewing on liquid hops, but it makes this one stellar brew. It's just as thick as it needs to be.  D - I couldn't drink much of this. It's good, but i'd die from elevated acid level in my veins.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,user0317,4.12,"Thanks to Bobsmn for sharing this 22oz bomber with me.  Poured a hazy orange color with 2 fingers of persistent head and moderate carbonation. This beer has a sharp grapefruit scent, with a hint of pine needles in the background. I could sit here and just smell this one for several minutes.  The flavor profile is largely bitter grapefruit with an adequate amount of biscuit notes to balance things out. The hop flavor is very strong on this one, but not overbearing.  This beer is quite drinkable and has a pleasant, if slightly dry mouthfeel to it. I really enjoyed trying this dipa, however I do not mourn that it is not available at liquor stores in Minnesota. There are plenty of comparable midwestern dipas that can proudly stand next to a ruination.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,dismal,4.55,"I've been dying to try this one since I've heard nothing but really good things about it. Poured into a tulip pint glass it poured a light copper, light amber, almost hazy orange color with a small head but left some lacing down the glass. The smell is hoppy as expected. The taste is wonderful. Hoppy, bitter, a little sweet with a great mouthfeel and the alcohol is pretty well covered up. I'm loving this beer. I could drink it all day. This is a beer I'm going to definitely pick up again and would go out of my way to get.

Retention is very good and lacing is clumpy and sticky.  Smell is pure hops. Big citrus hops mix it up with a more mild pine presence. Big notes of grapefruit. Slight hint of caramel malt sweetness.  Hop City, we have arrived. Big presence of grapefruit and pine, alike. Citrus hops abound. Big bitter bite, especially in the aftertaste. Sweet malty presence attempts to come through, on the mid-pallette, but gets pummeled back down.  Smooth and easy to drink, with a slight sharp edge to it.

While other IPAs may have higher IBUs (though I seriously doubt there are many), this is one way hoppy beer, a very upfront assault on the tastebuds, akin to getting hit over the head with a baseball bat. Yeow!! Hops, hops, and more hops, with a bit of piney notes on the backend, and a lingering malty finish. I'd hope to give a more informed judgment on mouthfeel, but my palate is destroyed for the rest of the evening. Not for the faint of heart and not a session beer, and certainly not an entry brew for the category, but one of the best examples of SoCal DIPAs, IMHO.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Like freshly squeezed grapefruit juice, papaya and grenadine. Highly sweet smelling.  Taste is all hops. Very piney with strong hop bite that lingers. Grapefruit/citrus. Not nearly as sweet as it smells. Tongue numbing, a hopheads delight.  Medium bodied, medium carbonation. You can feel the hop bite on the tongue (100 IBU's!).  Good drinkability.

Mouth, bitter lupelin, slight oily residue coats your tongue, crying for another sip.  A definite sipper, the hoppy spiciness of this beer is extreme. Delicious floral character.

147,4083,Beertarded,4.22,"Out of all the Stone beers I have had this was the single one I wanted to try the most. It sounded like heaven and coming from Stone I knew it would be quality.  Well I was far from disappointed, but it did not hit me as hard as I expected. It poured a nice brown with a slight off-white head. The aroma was mostly hops but an almost roasted hickory smell was also present. Drinking this was great it is very complex with citrus and hops and much bitterness, in the best possible way. And the bitterness was calm and smooth, if you can believe. The hops just slowly blanketed my tongue and made it feel like home.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Hoppy at the beginning on the front of the tounge and at the back of the tounge. Slight malty in the mid range of the sip finished by the hops again. Grapefruity.

147,4083,BeerMark,3.22,"Purchased at Green's in Atlanta. Beer has a cool bottle and pours a little darker than a Miller High Life. Smells pretty good with a lot of hoppy aroma. After tasting, I must say that this one does not live up to the hype. It's hoppy and all but that's about it. Maybe one-dimensional is the best way to describe it. This beer has a sweet side to it but the malts don't seem to play a role in the sweetness. Almost like there is some type of ""artificial"" sweetness involved here. This seems strange to me and this is the reason I'm ranking this a little low. Somewhat overrated.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I hardly ever rate high on appearance but this one is quite nice and reminds me of my favorite, Switchback. Hops and citrus smells are prominent with a background I cannot quite identify but its a bit earthy. Really great tasting beer...big hops flavor but not much balance and not too complex. If you are really into hops this is worth a try. It's one sided with hops headed right into alcohol. Despite its lack of complexity I really like this one and would do it again...and again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

No sediment and overall transparent.  The smell is, as expected. There is an excellent level of citrus with some pine notes. There is a mild caramel smell behind the other aromas.  The taste is strong in citrus and pine. It also has a mossy component to me with a subtle sweetness from the malts that is quite pleaseant and definitely balances nicely. Quite bitter and a well hidden alcohol level.  The mouthfeel reveals a medium/full bodied brew with an excellent bitterness that lingers on the tongue and feels dry. It is not overwhelming and is quite smooth in my opinion. The carbonation is also well balanced with the flavor.  Overall, this is a very good beer. It is my first time having it and I'm quite impressed. I don't quite think it is at the caliber of Hopslam, but it is very good and I will keep my eyes open for it in the future.

147,4083,BeanBone,4.82,"Appearance: Somewhat hazy, rich amber-orange body with a two solid fingers of sticky, off-white head. Good lacing.  Aroma: Pungent, floral, citrusy, and piney hops are the focus here. There's booze and caramel malt underneath, but they're very much subservient to the hop onslaught. This smells damn good.  Taste: Aggressively bitter hops take charge of your mouth from the second they hit the palate, not letting go until they say so. Not just bitter, the hops are still grassy, floral, and citrusy. It's not all one-sided though, with enough caramel malt to keep it from being an absolute blowout. The alcohol is kept in check well. There's a terrifically long bitter aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Medium-full body that coats the mouth, allowing the aftertaste to linger for minutes. Moderate carbonation and a dry finish.  Drinkability: A little above average for the style, that is to say a relatively fast sipper. There are a lot of hops to contend with, but the alcohol is hidden rather well.  Verdict: Ruination is simply a massive beer. Stone have pulled off something masterful here, by keeping a beer so absolutely drenched in hop oil somewhat balanced. This is a must try for all hopheads.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BirdFlu,4.47,"Fist off... Coolest bottle ever. Not cuz of the image so much as the fact that it's painted/ink screened(?) on.. Pour is good but in some ways nothing extraordinary. It sort of looks just like Sam Adams lager or such.. The aroma is AMAZING- I'm not a huge hop fan but this is the sweetest hop aroma I've ever smelled. Flavor is interesting, not just like other hop bombs, this has a smooth balance. Hoppiness isn't biting up front, it's strong but mellow. Has an earthy base with some hint of malt which keeps it's crisp. Mouth is nice. Sort of full, definitely not thin. The aftertaste is pleasant and not overwhelmingly bitter. This certainly lives up to it's A status.. Very enjoyable for hop heads and those who aren't.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,roadhouse,4.25,"It's been too long since I've had this beer. It was my first venture into truly hoppy beers. I can't believe I haven't reviewed it yet. Oh yeah, I bought an old bottle last time and it sucked ass so I held off from reviewing. Let's hope this one is fresher!  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Piraat glass.  Appears a slightly hazy orange color with a one inch off-white head that sinks to a skim. Leaves a tiny bit of lacing.  Aromas of heavy citrus and pine, lots of grapefruit, a bit of herbal spiciness. Malt is basically nonexistent here.  Taste is exploding with the hops! What a surprise! Tons of citrus is coming through - grapefruit and orange. Piney flavors come through more in the finish. Believe it or not there actually is a slight sweet malt presence that makes itself known for a split second right at the start of the swallow before the ruination. Finish is bitter as hell.  Mouthfeel is medium, with a very nice creaminess that is crisp towards the end.  I can't believe I've gone this long without. Must have been the $16 per sixer price tag. Definitely one of the best DIPAs out there.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Stimack,3.93,"Brew poured to a cloudy yellow to orange color with a thick off white head that had good retention and left thick lacing along the sides of the glass. From the pour you could clearly notice the heavy amounts of hops that have been used in this brew. That aroma brings forth noticeable pine scent with a slight citrus mix. While this aroma was expected I was expecting it to actually be more pungent as it is labeled as over 100 IBUs. With this being said the hops is all I could pick up. The flavor is about the hops as well, though I feel that it is more like a grapefruit flavor. You do notice a unbalance malt flavor, that mixed together seem to give a slight sweet flavor. As I said the hops are very pungent and the hop resin like favor just sticks to the back of the tongue/mouth. Though this brew weighs in at 7.7% the alcohol does not come out. Nice brew, I am not a big hop head but once in a while they work for me. This one worked and is one I would get again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,nickfl,3.51,"A - One and a half fingers of bone white head on a yellow-orange body with good clarity. The head settles slowly and leaves a thick ring of lace on the wall of the glass.  S - Strong, grapefruit hop aroma with an underlying note of earthy, pine resin. It is hard to get past the hops, but there is a malty aroma under there with some mild caramel notes.  T - Strong, spicy bitterness with lots of pine resin and astringent, almost sour texture. Some malt breifly tries to break through but is beaten back down by sour grapefruit and intense bitterness.  M - Moderate carbonation, medium body, and a dry finish with very high astringency.  D - Take the description on the back of the bottle seriously; if you are not the kind of perverse hop head who enjoys masochistically high levels of astringent hop bitterness then this beer isn't for you. I found the aroma a bit weak and one dimensional, and the flavor more so. I hoped for more flavor and aroma emphasis, but sadly, this was the kind of flat, bitterness oriented IPA that I don't care for. Drinking this was kind of like sucking on a grapefruit filled with juniper berries, and while I do enjoy both grapefruit and gin (often together), that is not the experience I am looking for in a beer, even an IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Poured a great looking Orange and slightly cloudy beer, which in turn began the mouth watering.  S. Smell was of a citrus hopy dose, along with hints of grapefruit. Honestly a great smell for a IPA.  Taste and Drink ability was where I ran into so hills on both accounts. From the start to about half the glass I was in love with the malty sweetness and the citrus along with a taste of honey. The amount of hops you are slammed with is heavenly. After the initial half glass the taste left very quickly and became a bland bitterness.  Overall this is a good beer and I would recommend to anyone who loves a great IPA beer. I had hoped my first bottle taste and the loosing of the flavors half way threw it was the cause of food I was eating previously, but later on in the week tried it again and had a repeat result.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,zdk9,4.11,"A- An bright orange, very orange, like the color of orange dye #7 orange soda orange, globe forms in my glass. There was just a touch of head on the top, and that soon formed into a pattern, no not the Mona Lisa, or the Virgin Mary, but a tree. There was definitely a tree in the foam of my beer.  S- Strong and hoppy. I mark down beers so often because I don't find the aromas to be strong enough, but no complaints here. There is tangerine, a touch of lime, some crushed pine needles. And it's overlayed on a thick biscuity malt, with a splash of caramel.  T- My first impression is hops. Not, any sort of citrus or pine or earthiness, but pure unadulterated hops. Is it ruinous? I wouldn't say so- certainly bitter as hell, especially if you work it across your tongue. I do notice some malt coming through, but I wouldn't call this a balanced beer. It is absolutely hops forward with no qualms about it.  M- Syrupy, deep mouthfeel. Lasts on your tongue.  O- A delicious beer. This fills my hop requirement for the next month or so. While it's unbalanced, that doesn't really bother me. If you're going to make a hoppy as hell IPA then make it hoppy as hell.

147,4083,DmanGTR,4.45,"A - Poured a clear honey amber with a lovely, massive, nicely retaining 3"" white head in a tulip. Generous amount of lacing leaving islands of bubbles everywhere. Bubbles continuously stream from the apex of the glass. Beautiful.  S - A beautiful bouquet of hoppy citrus tang, pine resin, and light herbal tones balanced with sweet amber malts and a touch of alcohol. Hops are quite prominent and contribute significantly to the citrusy/piney aromas.  T - A small touch of malty sweetness initiates a full blown hop invasion of the palate. They weren't joking when they stated ""all other food and drink items suddenly become substantially more bland than they were..."" Incredible complexity of hops starting with an acidic saliva-inducing pucker followed by an intense herbal bitterness similar to lime peels and home-remedies, ending with a small note of sweet caramel malts, honey, and a touch of alcoholic warmth.  M - Medium bodied with a nicely balanced level of carbonation, not too soda like but not flat either. Perhaps it could use a touch more. Incredibly smooth.  D - Quite drinkable! A bomber is easily enjoyed and I could dig another one!  Overall - ""Enjoy by 11/19/08"" on the side. Do you like being attacked by a relentless onslaught of hops? Do you like how hops take over your palate and hold you hostage until after you have finished the entire bomber? Well this is the beer for you. Intense hoppiness and happiness bundled into one bittersweet package. This is not for the non-hophead. This is the hoppiest beer I have had yet and I love it! The only complain I have is it could use just a touch more carbonation. Otherwise, a hop lover's dream.

Huge fresh dry-hop smell. Very light malt hiding in the background.  Taste is pineapple, followed by bitter citrus. Very clean with a lingering hop bitterness. Intense dry-hopped taste comes out from hiding as it warms...Nothing too exotic, but very solid indeed. Complex and balanced hop profile. Definitely coming through as it warms-great melding of the dry hop character, citrus, and hop bitterness. Pink grapefruit coming through now--excellent. I think it is giving me cottonmouth--all these hops are drying out my palate!  Mouthfeel is brilliant- allowing it to glide over the tongue with no problem indeed.  Drinkability- After having the Hopslam and Double Simcoe recently, (both at around 10%) this one is much easier to throw down. Great offering.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

A= A thick dense mess of hazy dark yellow with a small head that lasts throughout the drink with great lacing S= from the moment I took the cap off of this one I got a hop blast.

147,4083,CrellMoset,4.32,"Stone Ruination, on tap ... somewhere, I can't remember, but these were in the notes on my phone, so I figured I might as well upload it!  Appearance: Comes a slightly hazed, sunset orange colored brew with a one-finger, foamy, hop-protein induced (or at least supported) head of definite above-average retention. The carbonation is slow and relatively sparse. The lacing is sheetlike at first, and erratic and glittery thereafter. A solid looking brew, attractive and inviting.  Aroma: Huge herbal grapefruit greets the nose warmly, followed closely by hints and flourishes of strawberries, spicy, hay-like grass, orange peel, lemon zest, a few mint-like notes. This one's wonderfully complex.  Taste: Huge, biting, herbal bitterness, bucketloads of grapefruit and orange zest, mint, grass, and a lot of very high and estery notes. There's also - surprise! - tons of bitterness, but also some balancing sweetness, slightly roasted, but with enough simple sugary notes to keep the bitterness from truly ""ruining"" your palette (which is in my opinion, a good thing). Again, very complex and well rounded on the hop side of the ledger.  Mouthfeel: Reasonably well carbonated. This one manages to be crisp, despite the fairly thick and sticky body.  Drinkability: A classic. This is an intense brew, bitter yet flavorful, surprisingly low in alcohol for the style (7.7% is nothing to sneeze at, but when DIPAs regularly clock in at double-digits, this one's refreshing), attractive, and crisp. A go-to for hop heads and rightfully so. If you haven't try it, do so. If you have, well, try it again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,haningj2,4.07,"Appearance - Absolutely fantastic. Pours a wonderful light brown color that every IPA should seek. Has a great head and magnificent lacing all the way to the bottom of the glass.  Smell - I wish I could harness this smell and put it in a candle. Obviously, very hoppy, fruits, lots of pine. Very distinctive.  Taste - Are you kidding me? This brew kicks you in the face upon first sip to last. It's crisp, rich, and very balanced. Stone did a marvelous job of balancing so much hops and not ruining the IPA with malts. You still get great malt flavor without hindering the dryness of the hops. There are a couple of fruits that stick out but the pine flavor is overbearing in the greatest of ways.  Mouthfeel - Simply put, amazing. I don't know what else to say about this beer. I wouldn't recommend drinking this with a meal. I would wait until after as you won't be able to taste your food if you drink with it. It definitely lets you know he's there.  Drinkability - Surprisingly good. I found myself sipping on it quicker than I expected. For something so overbearing, it's easy to find yourself picking up your glass so often.  Overall, this beer is absolutely incredible. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. I drank Ruination IPA around 10:30 PM, brushed my teeth later that night, and still had this flavor on my tongue the next morning. INCREDIBLE.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Shane94941,4.75,"Simply put, amazing. An IPA which doesn't forget about the barley. A smooth rich barley taste hits your mouth followed immediately by a perfect hop finish. The barley seems to deliver the hops to your taste buds. Expensive, $14.99/six pack at BevMo near San Francisco or about $5.00/22oz bottle...but definitely worth every penny.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Intelligentsia,4.47,"Classic DIPA nose, full of pine, tropical fruit. It's something that all of Stone's beers have in common. The taste is wonderful, with a big blast of hops at the end -- much like Stone says with Arrogant Bastard, I'm not worthy. This is the one beer that is a constant in my fridge, and easily one of my all-time favorites.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Spikester,4.55,From a bottle with an enjoy by date 4/07/09 so it must be fairly fresh. Pours clear amber with a fat one finger cream color head. Moderate amount of lacings. Aroma is piney resinous hops. Taste is orange grapefruit resinous hops with a surprisingly rich caramel malt partner. The mouthfeel gets fairly close to a barley wine but the taste remains in the IIPA realm. It has a pine needle dry bitter finish. Overall a fine beer. One that I would highly recommend.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,djeucalyptus,4.13,"pours a beautiful glowing golden orange-straw hue with an impressive cream colored two-finger fluffy head with impressive retention that fades to a frothy cap, leaving beautiful lacing to the bottom.  aroma is hoppy. citrus, grapefruit, a hint of pineapple and a good helping of floral hop notes. a touch of pine. a touch of caramel. a bit of biscuit, but pretty much hops. with a few more hops.  Deliciously hoppy, with occasional glimpses of a strong malt backbone. a bit of caramel and a touch of bread make it through the hop-heavy taste of grapefruit pith, oranges, pine, and a bit of floral hops. Well balanced in terms of hop profile, relatively unbalanced on the whole. A nice clean pine bitterness finishes.  Smooth and thick with ample fine carbonation. a touch sweet/syrupy, and a touch hop-astringent at times, but it's to be expected with something called Ruination. thick but smooth and crisp. Goes down cleaner than it should.  all in all, a fairly solid brew. All it's cracked up to be. An excellent example of a west-coast DIPA with that characteristic hop profile Stone loves so much. Frighteningly drinkable with an abv that stays hidden through the whole ordeal. Definitely worth seeking out.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,IBUnit63,4.55,"It's been a long time since my earlier Ruination review so I wanted to do this up again. Original review follows...here goes...  22 oz. into Duvel tulip. BBD says...11/19/2008?! WTF? I just got this a couple of weeks ago. Let's see how it fares; may review a fresher one soon. There's always room for more Ruination...  Pours a perfect butter creme 2-finger head with nice lacing and solid retention. Body is an excellent caramel/honey blend. Lighter than I remember...closer to its Stone IPA little sister. A bit of chill haze on this one.  There's a nice floral tone to the hops but it's muted by huge caramel viscosity in the malt. Could be a function of time. Alcohol is subtle, but it's there. Very enjoyable wafting scents.  Well, the hops are there on the palate. More citrus emerges in taste, as well as some bitter grapefruit rind. Malt is huge and gelatinous...in a good way. A little lighter than I recall but solid nonetheless. Incredible balance, believe it or not.  One word...silky. As huge as this is, this is not unbalanced, at least to me. The viscosity of the sweet caramel-tasty malt is cut perfectly with the poignant hop brightness of floral and mostly citrus feel. A slight tinge of earth is in there but it's very negligent. This is pretty well perfect.  This drinks well but there is a little weight on it - the grapefruit rind slows it down a touch, as does the huge viscous malt and slight boozy profile. Will look at this one periodically and soon get a fresher one to sample. Having said that, it's still amazing and an all-time favorite.  ---  Original review 1/27/2008:  A+ / 4.8 look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | drink: 4.5 rDev: +10.4%  If you're looking for an enjoyable blow to the head with a hop-flavored sledgehammer, this is it. One of the best synergies between malt and hops I've ever come across - the extrabitterness of the bushels of hops jive with the maltiness and the heavy alcohol wallop but rather than standing alone, they combine to make beautiful music together. Bit more viscosity than the everyday-drinking (if you're lucky) Stone IPA. How can you not love this stuff?

Lots of hops. A sweet caramel scent cowers in the background.  Taste starts off with a hefty dose of flowers and grapefruit rind. A little pine as well. Malt is almost undetectable. Finishes with an intense bitterness and a hoppy resin that seems to coat the mouth. Probably the most aggressive bitterness I've had in a beer. Body is medium and seems light when compared to the alcohol content.  One of the best IPAs out there, hands down.

T: Hops, hops, and more hops come out to party on the tongue. Citrusy in nature and piney on the withdraw make for a delicious concoction.  M: Nicely carbonated that plays nice with all the hops present. Little thickness involved, but is only to be expected. The finish on this beer is the clincher, really the star of the show.  D: One of the finest Dipa's I had ever had the privilege to wale down. Big on ABV, but is really undetected. This one makes a great closer, or like tonight a stellar kickoff to the evening.

Pours a nice deep golden color with nice little bubbles hand delivering zesty hop intensity to the micro-thin head thats been delivered. You little devils, you!  Smells awesome. Well, okay I'll expand. Smells of powdered sugar, citrus, grapefruity awesomeness, lemon zest and more sugary, hoppy goodness.  Christ. My tongue has been rendered useless. Ruination has taken everything from me. The sheer bite and hoppy-goodness has dried my tongue almost instantly. Okay, maybe I am being dramatic BUT damn this stuff is intense.  Love all that hoppy niceness. Oh Ruination, you truly do rock a hophead's world.  Could I drink more than one? Yes, well, maybe that is not up to me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,omnipotentuser,4.4,"I am used to Dogfish 90 Minute and it is quite difficult for me to find anything better than it. Stone's Ruination finally comes close and it has more hops (100+ IBU) so it feels more bittery and that lost some points for my cravings with IPAs. The higher the IBU, the more it has to cover its bitterness with extra flavoring of other realms.  Drinkability is high as I would drink 2-3 into the night and feel dazzled. This beer deserves some serious attention.  The best thing about this beer is its smell. It smells truly wonderful. A easy showoff allowing bystanders to take a sniff and they're sold.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Quite bitter but there the flavor and aroma of some of the other qualities of hops.  Appearance - Light gold yellow. Great foamy head that retains. Good lacing.  Smell - Fresh hops take up most of the bouquet, leaving the faintest room for a hint of sweet malt. There may be multiple types of hops in there, I don't know but the smell is like smelling one packet of hop pellets. I love that smell.  Taste - Full of hops, bright, green, pine. Like eating a hop pellet. There's nothing else in the taste to me, so I wouldn't say it's complex.  Mouthfeel - Alpha Acids bitter that lingers. Clean and refreshing if you like this level of bitterness.  Drinkability - Good, though maybe I'd just have one bomber and after drinking a beer like this, you really can't switch to something else and taste it correctly.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Head topped off at a good two fingers and left some pretty serious rings of lace in its wake.  Perfumey, floral, herbal hops with an earthy malt base. Citrus hangs in middle with a little fruitiness and alcohol.  The malt forms a really nice base for the hops to dance and shake their way onto your tastebuds. The hops lend a soft floral flavor up front leading to citrus rind and pine before the bitter assault takes place.  Medium to full bodied with a creamy mouthfeel. The carbonation is perfectly even, but the hops aren't as chewy as I would hope.  This bomber was down and out pretty quick.

147,4083,StarlightSeraph,4,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter.  Appearance: Pours a cloudy golden-orange, with a finger-and-a-half white head. The head subsided pretty rapidly. Left a nice blanket of lacing.  Smell: Grassy and piney hops dominate. I think I can pick out hints of citrus, but not sure. Some honey sweetness in the background, but not much. The sweetness becomes more evident as the beer warms.  Taste: Surprisingly balanced in the first sip. The initial hop bite is mixed with a malt, honey sweetness. Alcohol is also present behind the bite. The malt sweetness subsides quickly, but the hop taste never really subsides, and carries on strong into the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Thick, and highly carbonated. The high carbonation adds more of a bite to the beer. It's almost too highly carbonated, though.  Drinkability: A more balanced IPA than most. The namesake doesn't lie, as this beer will destroy your palate - the malt sweetness is needed in the background to counteract the intense hops. Definitely a sipper, and enjoyable. It's different than most IPAs I've had, as there's barely any citrus character.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,tittymcj,4.29,"This review took place inches from William Pang (Queens, NY).  Poured out a light orange-gold, with a thin and quickly disappearing head but good lacing appearing throughout.  This one smells pretty heavily of hops, but there is clearly a presence of malt just behind, balancing it out a little in the nose.  At first, the taste is extremely bitter and hoppy. However, after getting used to the initial assault, the malt becomes very apparent and does well to provide depth to this IPA.  Light to medium body, pretty well carbonated, and feels smooth in the mouth after the initial stinging hops. Definite lingering bitterness, however.  This is probably the fourth one of these I've had, and i find it to be very easy to drink the entire bomber, and maybe even more. Strong flavors, unsurprisingly, but not unbearable, and definitely one that I will continue to drink.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Not very good head retention, which was surprising, because I feel like Stone brews often have amazingly long head retention. Wonderful citrus scents. Very floral hops. Wonderful balanced taste. Quite hoppy, but not overly bitter and unpleasant like other over-the-top IPAs. For such an intimidating beer and name, the flavors are actually very well balanced, and I don't feel like the drink is comically hopped up. Medium bodied. Great mouthfeel.  Another winner by Stone.

Taste turns that around, though - some sweetness underneath, with a big, slightly pungent, citrusy hop body that has a nice tingle to it. Very dry. As the beer warms, the malt body comes out more and more, and by the end there's a big, sticky caramel presence up front, before giving way to the huge, bitter hops behind. Ironically, despite the heavy hop body, the finish starts out only moderately bitter, but builds up with every sip.  Mouthfeel is a bit fluffy, lush, bit light, which helps this one on the drinkability scale. Yum.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,biboergosum,4.42,"12oz bottle - I grabbed this at a grocery store in Austin, Texas late last year, opting for the smaller version, the better to pack back home through the not always so friendly skies.  This beer, poured into a standard American pint glass, appears a slightly hazy, medium apricot-orange hue, with a few skinny fingers of thickly foamy, and densely bubbly off-white head, which leaves some melting iceberg lace around the glass as it duly recedes.  It smells of rather bitter white grapefruit, underripe navel oranges, lemon Pledge, and further unnameable tropical fruit, gritty, somewhat grainy pale malt, ethereal caramel notes, a certain chalky flintiness, and a sort of separated at birth floral perfumed character. The taste is a salvo of unchecked bitterness at first, the tart citrus (orange, grapefruit, and lime, mostly) and pine resin fairly intense, before the seemingly behind the scenes pale and caramel malt barely sticks its head up over the horizon, along with a still pervasive flinty, um, er, 'stoniness', and those big flowery, well-soused sister hops carrying on like that one particular aunt at a family reunion.  The carbonation is moderate, just giving some pleasantly frothy pep, if only to distract somewhat from that swingin' hop party, the body a heady medium-full weight, and smooth in a well dissonant cognitive sense - the hops and elevated alcohol can be ignored (at your own peril), if you really try! This ruinous beauty finishes dry, like there was any doubt, with a nice warm, lingering citrus and piney bitterness.  Everything promised by the still amusing and enjoyably overwrought labeling is delivered, so I cannot, in good faith here, fault truth in advertising. As I fancy myself a connoisseur (hah!) of the style, it did indeed take an acclimatizing first few sips, before this went down as nice and smooth as it was meant to, soon disappearing way too quickly, for my liking and my needs.

147,4083,astrasday,3.44,"Poured this from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass. A hazy, surprisingly light amber color (I was expecting something much darker) with small white head that quickly dissipates. Sticky lacing throughout.  Smell is a whopping floral bouquet with hops, hops and more hops. citrus, caramel and molasses are also present.  Taste. Hop bitterness crashes through and takes hold of my taste buds. Ruination, indeed. The flavor turns ever so slightly sweet with strong caramel a citrus touch, some biscuit and then back into the cheek sucking bitterness of the hop.  Mouthfeel. Crisp, oily and sharp. This brew certainly rolls around on the palate and gives it a medium bodied feel.  Drinkability. Most DIPAs I can put away one after another appreciating the hops, but also the sweetness balanced with it. This is not a balanced brew. And, for all those extreme hop heads who love their fix, this is certainly one to examine. For my tastes however, it was just a bit too much. Something about seemed... artificial.

S- Amazing, like the meadow in my dream where a beautiful german beer maid is running towards me, and I towards her, to embrace in the middle. T- Really great, they did a great job balancing these huge flavors. although a DIPA, it's really well balanced and the bready malt comes through clear with some caramel sweetness and butteriness. i get some of the fruitiness, mostly the high end of citrus, but the combination of that with the malts definitely gives a faint tobacco wisp. M- really great, does it's job of ruining. d- For a DIPA, this has probably the best drinkability due to its balance. while i couldn't session, a 22oz bomber isn't hard to get down.  While i loved this, i also love their regular IPA, and don't feel that this is too far above that. Their regular IPA has a great hop profile that is intensified in this brew, but that's not always necessary and for a couple extra bucks i can get a 6 pack of the regular stuff!

147,4083,popery,4.47,"Very good DIPA. Ruination was one of the first beers to get me hooked on craft beer, and I still like it very much. It has a caramel sweet malty backbone that serves to bring out the hop profile beautifully. Having tried many other DIPAs now, I find that I'm more impressed with the maltiness than the hops. A lot of big IPAs have too little malt sweetness to realize their hop flavors fully. This beer does not suffer from this flaw. The caramel malt is strong and assertive and cuts out most of the hop bitterness, allowing the rich, oily grapefruit flavors of the hops to push to the forefront. I find the hop profile just a tad on the boring side at this point. Let me qualify that quite a bit. I love the hops in Ruination, however it tastes a lot like many San Diego DIPAs. Of course, this is most likely down to other breweries looking to Stone, rather than the other way round. That said, I find the hop profile dominated by bitter grapefruit, without a lot of pine, spruce or floral aspects like you get in some DIPAs. All that said, this is a minor point and it's still a delicious, very hoppy beer. The beer looks pretty great, although after seeing some of the gigantic DIPAs with heads that are almost orange with hop oiliness, my standards are set unbearably high. The feel is very nice. It certainly doesn't ""ruin"" your palate as much as some overly aggressive DIPAs. I'm surprised at how close I now find Ruination and DFH 90 min, as that seems like an obvious comparison to make. Sure, Ruination has a bit more bitterness, and the hop profiles differ, but both beers have very rich malt characters as compared to many beers in this style. I wonder if their rich malt backbones at somewhat lower alcohol contents plays into their popularity. Now, I'm rambling and I'll wrap this thing up. Ruination is a great beer, and Stone is a great brewery.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,LeftonJackman,4.43,"Enjoyed this bully of an IPA with a good friend on a cold Tuesday night.  Served in a pint glass from the well, a right amber with glimmers or orange. Nice head with a pleasing lace striped down my glass.  A very hoppy pine aroma in the nose and a little something citrus that I cannot place. Until...  Strong presence of ruby red grapefruit and imposing hops. A very very delicious IPA!  A warm draw washes down nicely leaving me thirsty enough for another taste, but hard to think of as anything more than a one drink beer. Destined to be one of my favorites!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,TStandley13,4.12,"A: Looks like most IPA's, burnt orange color. leaves a decent lace on my glass from a two finger head.  S: uh...hops! Smells like regular Stone IPA.  T: BITTER and SWEET - if thats even possible. Definite IPA taste but bitterness lingers on tounge long after beer is drained.  M: nothing notable  D: pretty drinkable, but leaves you with some serious cottonmouth.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,pd360,2.07,"Well, this beer came highly recommended and also suggested by my server at a nice restaurant to go with my main course. When my wife started reading the back of the bottle before I tasted it I already knew it was a poor choice, why would I want something that was going to ""ruin"" my palate with a nice dinner? The pine and citrus scents that are referred to by other reviewers just hit me as a insect repellent / citronella and the taste was no better. Not only did it taste bad, but it made my dinner taste worse, I will not be drinking this one again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,MPLS,4.2,"First off, really cool looking bottle. Stone sure likes to embrace dark creatures and this stamped/etched beer bottle is awesome.  A: A pleasant murky orange with a nice bubbly 2 cm head.  S: 100 IBUs? Floral, with a pronounced hop nose.  T: Expected more bitterness. Good when I am fighting with sweet malts and want some more hops in my life.  M: Medium body, carbonated, hop characteristics.  D: Pretty drinkable, especially with the hops leaving you with a dry palate that beckons you drink more.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,farrago,4.05,"Bright amber-red color with plenty of cloudiness to deepen it, good froth with some lacing, hard to see any bubbles. Mixed citrus gives the nose a zesty character, oatmeal, leans heavily on the hops, oily pine and tea leaf, too dense to parse out much else. Medium-bodied with again the kind of density which makes it appear heavier than it is. Some malty softness on the attack but, like duh, it's the hops which run the show. The grapefruit, lemon, orange citrus does slightly sweeten things. Weight and density consistent to finish. Subtle floral notes. Very good beer that I could not drink very frequently.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,markaberrant,4.5,"A - crystal clear, light orange, creamy white head leaves behing intricate webs of lace  S - fresh pungent hops, lots of pine, some sweet notes, grapefruit  T - hoppy goodness from beginning to end, really flavourful and tasty, but you still get a nice balance of sweetness from the malt, even a biscuit note in the finish, which is also plenty bitter, aftertaste is more piney hops  M - lip smacking bitterness, slightly oily, medium body and carbonation, touch of alcohol warmth after a couple sips, dry finish  D - a powerful beer, yet still approachable (for those accustomed to a blast hops), which combines to make it a dangerously drinkable choice.  Very impressive. Yeah, Stone is all about the hops, and smashing you over the head with them, but the malt profile is damn tasty, a perfect match for the hops. An outstanding beer, and one I will most certainly seek out again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,therealnod,4.49,"Bought this at Sunflower Market. 22oz bomber into a Stone nonic.  A: Gold/orange/copperish, much like Stone's regular IPA. Stark white head with good retention, some lacing.  S: Smells like...their regular IPA with some hops added. A kinda woodsy component comes in.  T: A lot like their, well, their regular IPA with some extra hops thrown in. A big bitter finish that lingers untill the malts come to clean up...quite nice. The only departure from the IPA I detect is that the finish is longer and more bitter with the malts coming later (making the finish...well, longer and more bitter).  M: If I said it was just like their regular IPA, would that surprise you? True to style.  D: As drinkable as...their regular IPA, which means quite.  Notes: Well, it definitely isn't Stone IPA, but it isn't far off. This breew seems lazy to me...just brew the regular IPA and add more hops. That doesn't make it bad, or boring, just unoriginal.I love Stone's IPA, so this can't possibly be a negative review, I'm simply expressing dissapointment that I didn't sample a significantly different beer; it certainly didn't ruin my palate. Stone delivers tons of macho marketing hype, but they brew incredibly balanced big beers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Grandwazoo,3.94,Burnt yellow with orange hints. Okay head.  Big nose of hops with orange and a hint of cinnamon. Wonderful smell.  Sweet apricot and orange malt with cappuccino cream. Nice long flaovor that builds and then setlles into a long hoppy finish. Very -- almost too --- dry at the end....made me a little thirsty!,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Riccymon,3.78,"An average pour from the bottle yielded more than two fingers of pillowy-white head on top of a good-looking, orangey-golden beer. Not surprisingly, hop aromas, particularly of the floral and pine variety, are present, though not overpowering. Ruination's taste is by no means unique among IPAs, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The herbal, flowery hop notes come through head-on, with a little of the alcohol joining in toward the finish. Despite the intense hopping, I found this beer to be less bitter than expected; the finish even seemed slightly sweet. In addition to a pleasant finish, Ruination was creamy in the mouthfeel, and just generally drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Docer,3.71,"Purchased a 22oz. bottle from Belmont Station. Poured into a tumbler glass...  What a nice foggy golden amber look... very little head as poured... minimal lacing as well. To me... a crap-load of lacing doesn't make a beer better than an other.  Smell is quite mild really... almost like the ale is holding on to it's every bit of flavor... locking it all in.Little bit of spice, and pumpkin. Slight banana yeast scent.. but mild.  Bright citrus background on a rather smooth malt finish... yeast is present..  Doesn't leave a dry pallet.. actually doesn't taste nearly as strong as it says... very easy to drink... and really goes right to the brain! Not bad! Not my favorite IPA either..",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,MashMouth,4.18,"I was quite suprised by this beer. It pours with a bright golden color and has just the right head. The smells and aromas of this beer are awsome if you like the smell of hops. It reminds me of when I cut open a bag of hops for homebrewing. It has good drinkability the hop bitterness is not so overwhelming as you might think. Ballance was very well achived for such a strongly hoped beer. Although I personally would not tip back a number of these in a row, I find it a good beer to enjoy on occasion.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,JBogan,3.43,"A medium golden/orange color with a large foamy white head. Good lacing.  Smells of citrus, hops and a bit of pine.  Taste wasn't as balanced as I'd like. The hops just dominate everything else. Grapefruit is in there somewhere, along with some malt if you really go looking for it.  Mouthfeel was crisp, if a bit on the thin side. Still, one of the better brews in this regard.  This isn't something I'd care to session. While not as over the top as some of Stone's beers, it's still a little hop heavy for my taste. I'm sure there's a market out there for it though.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Beerbuddha,4.3,"Appearance: This beer poured an orange-y yellow with a nice fluffy white head. Lacing was present the whole time.  Smell: Hops and more hops! A nice subtle hint of sour grapefruit.  Taste: A nice toasted bread flavor in the front that is quickly masked by a HUGE bitterness. This beer is HOPPY! Again, as in the nose, a subtle hint of grapefruit. The piney hoppiness dominates here though.  Mouthfeel: Slightly heavy body with medium carbonation. Kind of thick and syrupy.  Overall: Overall this beer appeals to the hopheads only. For the style of beer(Imperial IPA) it is a great beer. It fits the style quite well. I see why they call it Ruination because it completely ruined my palate.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,bfields4,4,An appealing pale gold haze gives way to a nice frothy head.  Distinctly hoppy smell lets you know this is def an IPA maybe a little pine also.  The piny bitter taste hits me right away as it is then subdued by a citrus sweetness that gives this beer lasting drinkability for me.  Great mouthfeel with a good balance to its taste that's not to creamy and not to smooth.  This and their regular IPA have sold me on IPAs (not to mention their Belgain IPA). Was starting to turn around and with the help of Boulevard. A trip out to Colorado helped me really appreciate this style.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

As the dissipates it leaves a nice lacing on the glass. There is some carbonation in the beer. The clarity of the beer is slightly cloudy.  Nose: A heavy grapefruit, pine and floral aroma. There is a subtle sweetness in the maltiness.  Taste: A nice grapefruit, pine and floral, follow a nice malty backbone. There is a subtle sweetness in the beer.  Overall: An astringent chalky mouth feel, with a bitter finish that last on the palate. The IPA is well built and is very nice to enjoy. I don't usually like IPAs but this one is an exception. I like the way it was make and I like Stone brewery. The only thing I can think of is try to bring the maltiness forward a bit.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,DeepSix,4.32,"Had it on tap at Max's. Was a nice cloudy amber/orange color. Lacing lasted pretty much the whole beer.  Smell was a deep hop note, with next to no malt noticeable, unsurprising in the style. Very rich smell.  Continuation of the smell. A rich hop taste, where the malt is a bit more noted here then in the smell. A floral taste in a sense. The hops are noted in the mouthfeel as well so its medium to almost thick, with just a bit of carbonation.  This is a great beer, maybe my favorite DIPA, I could drink a couple of these a night, but I probably shouldn't do too many of them. The alcohol is why, not the hops.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Orange peel, citrus, and pine are present in the after taste.  M- Not watery at all (I dont want to say creamy). Bitter with moderate carbonation.  D- Excellent Imperial IPA. I would say I like the regular Stone IPA better, however. This one is a little heavier than the regular Stone IPA, which makes it a little less drinkable in my opinion. Would prefer just drinking about 3 of these as opposed to an entire 6 pack in one sitting. Highly recommended if you are a big hop fan.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The beer is designed to shock the taste buds with so much hop flavor and bitter bite that the carbonation is almost an after thought. I love this beer. I am a true hophead and this beer is not for the faint of heart. Lift up your glass and sip it down.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Bananaman,4.53,"This is my third beer from Stone Brewing, and they are still to dissapoint me. This is almost as excellent as an IPA gets.  The beer pours a burning golden/orange color with a huge white head that stays until the beer is finished. It leaves quite a lacing on the glass aswell.  Smells great of hops and tropical fruits, you can really tell that this one is packed with hops due to the almost parfumy smell of hops.  The taste lives up to the smells with huge amounts of hops. The fruity notes from the smell can really be felt in the taste aswell. There are also notes of pine-needles and some fudge candy. The beer is suprisingly malty for an IPA.  All and all, a great IPA from a great Brewery.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Beernoisseur,4.7,"Aah, the legendary Ruination from Stone. I've been wanting to try this one for a long, long time.  Poured from a bomber style bottle into a pokal.  A - Beautiful orangey amber with a touch of haze. Nice nuggety head that looked as if it intended to maintain itself forever.  S - Wow. Where to begin? This is a massively complex beer. Citrus with floral. Pine with Herbs, and grasses. Woody and sweet. Dusty, with minerals. I think that about covers it.  T - Wow again. There's just so much there. Fruity esters and alcohol. Citrusy with loads of hops. Pine and herbs (rosemary, lavender?) all over the place. Floral and woody, almost sawdusty. Definitely a huge bitter element, but it's all part of the grand scheme. Excellent flavor in this beer.  M - soft and wonderful  D - I could drink a terrifying number of these beers.

Blows competition out the water with the flavor. There can only be one, and seriously, one - I wouldn't even ask for another of these in the same night. Mad respectable as an annihilating hopfix.

It poured a beautiful peach-y orange body with a huge creamy head. TONS of lacing, very fresh. The aroma hit me before I even put my nose to it - those great Stone hops, pine, citrus, pineapple. Delicious. The taste was of smooth malts, ripe pineapple and peaches followed by the welcoming pine-y hop kick.  It was so crisp and intense on the palate it's hard to describe. Went down so well and so smooth. If you've never had this beauty on tap before, do not pass up the opportunity if one surfaces.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

All their beers are highly rated on BA and seem to have a strong following but I have been disappointed in all the beers I have tried from here.  This beer looks promising, nice color, nice head. The smell is of citrusy hops and slightly piney.  The taste was average at best. Bitter, bitter hops, no character, no depth, biting hop flavor. Did they even try? This is weak. It's just a hop bomb. I love hoppy brews but this is not a good IIPA. It tastes like a standard IPA with a touch of alcohol.  This beer doesn't do anything for me and pales in comparison to the king of IIPA's, DFH 90 minute.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S: Like walking through a pine forest while drinking gin and carrying various lemons and grapefruits. An abundance of complex hoppy aromas.  T: Marvelous. Just...beautiful. Very, very piney and bitter. Some slight citric flavors as well, but mostly piney. Very little malt presence...it's unbalanced, but beautifully and intentionally so.  M: Extremely crisp, though not quite puckering. Just the right amount of carbonation as well. It's tingly all the way down.  D: If this weren't 7.7% ABV (and also expensive), I could be happy only drinking this beer. And I'd drink many of them every day.

Stone brews are all similar in their high alcohol percentage but still very enjoyable for the micro-brew connoisseur. There short story's on the back of all their brews are enjoyable to read as well and I find Ruination's to be true, the part about not being able to enjoy lesser brews after developing a favorable taste to the double IPA!

It makes a bold statement and does not spare the exclamation point at the end.  Pour: Light colored, like straw. Ruination has a healthy foamy head, 2.5 fingers that last. It leaves a thick sheet of beautiful lacework once it does settle.  Smell: In a word, HOPS. The hops are ever present, yet this beer still isn't bitter. The malt and alcohol keep the hops in check. Yes, there is a citrus undertone, and some toasted muffin scent underneath.  Taste: This is where this beer really wins out. Yes, it is a powerful IPA, but this is no one trick pony either. This beer continues to impress with a complex array of flavors from the citrus lead in to a more refined cookie or biscuit taste in the end. Some people think this beer is bitter, I would say it is strong. There is almost an edge, but just as you think it has an edge, it lets off and gives you desert.  Drinkability: I could drink this beer all day, but I love the hops and complexity.  Notes: I don't like to claim I have a favorite beer because there are beers for every occasion.

Huge, healthy pearly white head is thick and creamy, showing amazing retention! Leaves a thick sheet of beautiful lacework as it finally settles. One of the better lace jobs I've seen yet.  A: Hops, hops, and some more hops. Got a little lemon pine sol aroma to it, with some oranges and pineapple as well. Buried underneath all of this mind-blowing hop goodness is a toasty biscuity malt presence.  T: Wow! I was pretty sure that I'd like this by the smell of it, but this is even better than I expected. It's fantastic! Huge waves of delicious citrusy hops come crashing down on the tongue in the somewhat sweet start, then the bitterness begins to take over from there. Mouth-watering hop flavors full of lemons, clementines, and some pineyness has me hypnotized under it's spell. It's no one trick pony, though, as there is a nice clean biscuity malt presence with some caramel in the background. But, make no mistake, the hops are being showcased here front and center. There is a pungeant flavor that emerges halfway through that I find extremely pleasant, only adding to the depth of character. Finishes dry & full of bittering hops just as it should, but they are gentle IBU's if you can believe it. Aftertaste leaves your tongue tingling like crazy and yearning for some more hop-a-licious goodness. Outstanding!!!  M: Medium-bodied, deceptively smooth, and perfectly carbonated to provide the ideal bite to compliment the bitterness.  D: Excellent. What else can you say?  Notes: I love Stone beers! They are always incredibly full-flavored, bold, robust, and full of that signature character they always bring to the table. Ruination is no exception. To tell you the truth, it reminds me a bit of Hop Wallop. But, this blows it out of the water as far as I'm concerned. I think Ruination is, obviously, hop-forward in the taste, but does a great job of staying somewhat balanced and never crosses the line into the territory of being overwhelming. One of my favorites for sure! Highly recommended",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Taste starts with herbal, sour hop bitterness with some grapefruit, a little bit of malt in the background, then finishes with INTENSE bitterness and a small touch of alcohol. The carbonation is at a nice level and does not seem to attenuate the grapefruit flavors of the hops too much. Excellent feel in the mouth, and very easy to drink.  What a delight. The bitterness of this brew is what really makes it great. There is not too much sweety maltness going on, at least that I can taste, compared to some other double IPAs.

I drank a bottle last night with the intent to review. Here is what I wrote:  L - Attractive amber color - clear not hazy. Nice foamy head that forms rings with lacy patterns between.  S - Hops!

A nice one finger white fluffy head that starts delivering lacing immediately. As the drink progresses, the lacing is spectacular - looks like icicles.  S: Really big, super fresh leafy hops with lemony grapefruit.  T: Nice biting aggressive hop up front. Mellows out an then goes into a piney bitter aftertaste. Really big and really refreshing. Aftertaste is edging toward being too bitter but the ball manages to stay in play. There may be some malt there but it is clearly outranked unlike many of the DIPA's I have had recenty. The ""Ruination"" of senses is written as tongue-in-cheek marketing on the bottle but I actually felt my oral senses being numbed by this brew. It is definitely a hop assault. Luckily, I'm a hop head and I can appreciate it. Hold the boat! Right toward the last third of the drink when it warmed up, the malt came out and it is a subtler brew but just as impressive. Malt takes away the aggressiveness of the aftertaste but the hops are still big - really nice!  M: Light in body. Nice clean, crisp and well carbonated.  D: The lower ABV and lightness of this beer make it a very easy brew to throw back. It is a nice, clean and refreshing. Love the freshness of the hops.

147,4083,Chelsea1905,4.35,"This is actually the beer that brought me to this site, so I can't believe it has taken me this long to review it!!!  When poured into a snifter, it pours a nice slightly hazy light amber colour with an off white head. Very mild carbonation  Smells like lemon zest, dry hops, apricot, a little yeast and malt in the background. Strangely, and this isn't a dig at the beer, it smells like citrus washing up liquid!  Tastes great, nice bitter hops, very floral and the IBU's hit the tongue immediately. Slightly aftershave like alcohol taste too it also!  Mouthfeel is nice and lightly bubbly, not overly effervescent.  Pretty heavy in the ABV, but to be honest for a DIPA it's not overly bad! Could drink a bomber easily, but not too much more after!

147,4083,biggred1,4.5,"Light honey blonde with a fat pillow of head that lasts for several minutes after the pour. Leaves a ton of resinous lace all down the glass. Smells like fresh potent hops, piney and citrusy with a dollop of fresh bready yeastiness. Taste is very balanced between big hops and a smooth malty character very tasty but not really overly bitter for being supposedly over 100 IBUs, seems less bitter than the regular stone IPA to me. Good heavy smooth mouthfeel with a kind of dry salty finish, alcohol is well hidden. Dangerously drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,LilBeerDoctor,3.73,"Reviewed on 6/11/08. Bottle. Pours an orange/amber with a light tan head. Aroma of citrus, grapefruit, and pine. Flavor of bready malt, bitter hops (pine, citrus), and spices/salt. Really an onslaught of hops in this beer. Nice strong malt presence to mesh with the strong hops. A very good IPA, very well-balanced. 8/4/9/4/15 (4.0/5)  Update 12/30/08. Had a fresh bottle of this again. It is good but super bitter. Not as good as I originally thought but still tasty. Your palate really does take a beating. 7/4/8/4/15 (3.8/4)",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,yesyouam,4.16,"Stone Ruination IPA Pours with a frothy off-white head which fades in a few minutes. It is amber: about 10-12 SRM. It's a bit hazy. The hops are apparent in the first whiff (from about a meter away). I get an intricate aroma of herbs (wintergreen?) and possibly lemon. There is a hint of green apple and possibly salmiakki. The flavor brings thing into the medicinal realm, to be sure. An herbal flavor, again with salmiakki (I wonder what hop or hops are doing this) dominate and continue into the aftertaste. A very wet and delicate medium to light texture with a very slight carbonation gives way to a dry, lightly alcoholic aftertaste. I personally prefer an IPA to go the dry-hopped floral route (a la Magnolia's Proving Ground Pale) when over 100 IBUs but, that said, the bitterness was pulled off very craftily in this beer. This really doesn't seem more that double the bitterness of a Liberty Ale. It's more complex than I expected it to be. (rated Jan 17, 2007)",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Klgkenny,4.3,"A light pour into a pint glass--  Pour produces a thin head which leaves rings on the glass as I drink. The ruination is a glowing gold. Bubbles of carbonation sporadically rise as the glass is disturbed.  The ruination initially smells of apples, then hops, and finally a scent of white zinfandel... Don't ask me, it's what I smell. Prior to actually drinking the beer, as I inhale through my mouth, I can already taste the hops.  Once I finally take a sip, the aromas metamorphose into tastes. A lightly sweet, honey, sticky apple taste and then a tidal wave of hops. Everything that I had read about this beer had me prepared for a rush of offensive overly bitter hops, but the hops were perfectly balanced with the initial sweetness. Also, it seemed that as the beer warmed to room temperature, it became more balanced. A very pleasant taste. I am not generally pleased by IPA's, but this beer may be the one to make me switch teams.  Although the beer's taste becomes more balanced as it warms, the mouthfeels gets thinner. I will have to do an experiment to determine the perfect mean. Initially, the ruination is crisp and delightful. Extremely refreshing, but at the very end it seemed a bit slimier.  Very drinkable until the very end (and that may be because I drank too slow.) As I said earlier, this beer may be a gateway drug into the illicit world of IPA's.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,meday,4.35,"Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into an imperial pint glass.  Bright shiny golden color with just a hint of red. Nice head and head retention.  Immediately I could smelled what I thought was cascade, but looked up and found it was centennial hops. I new from reputation and smell this was going to be a vessel for hops.  Hello hops. Initial taste is hops. I couldn't get around the hop flavor. I usually love more balanced beers, but this hop flavor definitely is pleasant and not overbearing. It reminded me of the hop tea I made with one homegrown cascade hop and a bit of honey. It tastes like the base beer is very well balanced, with enough extra hops to make it a hop beer.  It has a great feel in the mouth, not strong or biting as some Double IPAs can get. If finishes well and I easy finished the bottle by myself (my wife hates all hoppy beers except for anything from Dogfish...weird)",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Decent 1/2"" white head with some laceing.  S- Wow, it smells like fresh squeezed hop juice! Nice big floral nose with lots of grapefruite and some pine.  T- It starts slightly sweet with a nice floral hops flavor. Big citrus profile, mainly grapefruite and lemons. Some nice light pine and grass compliment. Finishes with a nice spicey, peppery bite that coats the tounge. The hops are definatly the star of this show, but in a nice balanced progression.  M- Meduim body with a good carbonation. Slightly oily (maybe from all the hop oils!) that coats the tounge nicely. I will be tasteing this for hours.  D- Lovely beer! Aggresive hop profile that progress nicely from sweet and floral to citrusy and piney to spicey and bitter. I loved this a lot! I could easily kill a 6 pack in one sitting.

147,4083,Arbitrator,3.96,"Chilled bomber into a glass. I'm re-reviewing this. The last time I had it, I was really sick of hops and wrote a fairly down review of the beer. I have revisited it now that I'm really into IPAs.  A: Pours a clear orange body with 3 fingers of off-white head. Retention is spectacular, and the film collapses in sections over several minutes into a light collar on the brew. There is a thick sheet of sticky lacing down the glass as I drink. Lazy bubbles up the glass.  S: Hop bouquet. Mostly pine/herbal with a floral note, but there was plenty of citrus in there, too. Some earth.  T: Dominated entirely by hops. The showcase was definitely pine; when I agitated the beer, it was possible to pick up some herbal and floral touches. Through it all, there is an undercurrent of citrus, with particular attention to orange, grapefruit, and lemon flavors. The finish is a bright pine and grassy hop character that pulls into the finish and leaves a lightly sticky, bitter aftertaste. The beer is semi-dry, which explains why I have trouble picking up any malt.  M: Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation. About right for the style. ABV is well masked. Flavor is a bit sticky, but not too resiny. Semi-dry body and finish.  D: I'll be honest, I've spent so much time drinking Pliny that this just doesn't do it for me anymore. It's balls to the wall hops, without a lot of refinement or balance (two things that I feel Pliny does very well). I'd buy this once in a while, but as far as DIPAs go, it's not at the top of my list.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,baos,4.14,"12 ounce bottle into my Good-Luck Atlas jar.  A: 2 finger white head over a pretty orangey-gold color. Nice lacing.  S: Spice!!! Super hops and a hint of warm malt in there. Someone poured pine resin and kind bud hash in my fresh squeezed orange juice and said, ""here: smell!""  T: Now this is about as extreme as it gets before you wonder if someone gave you a glass of retsina. Super grapefruit peel and orange zest flavors that end really bitter and believe or not really good. If it is too much at first take your time and let it warm and sip it. This one will grow on you (That's what she said).  M: Nice medium feel with good carbonation.  D: It is awfully strong but I think three of these over cards of ultra spicy snacks is called for.

147,4083,jdklks,4.62,"A- deep, golden tint. very clear, with a nice white foam that lingers for awhile and then leaves traces.  S- magnificent! very very hoppy and fruity. one of the best smelling beers in my opinion.  T- again, magnificent. very hoppy with a lingering bitterness. hints of grapefruit at the end. slightly malty, but the hoppiness is so overwhelming that it establishes itself more than the other flavors. a great beer for the hophead!  M- medium bodied, and again, a lingering presence. very smooth, but at the same time it lets you know that it is there.  D- can easily get through a 6 pack of these and would more often if they werent so damn expensive. they go down easy and leave you feeling good. had to take off .5 of a point for the price as it is a beer that you want to savor, and as such, you only want to drink one or two a night.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Resin, resin, grapefruit, celery, and resin. Taste was immense. Resiny goodness coated evertthing from the white and pink grapefruit to the caramel cookie dough malt. No biscuits, either.

147,4083,adamette,3.16,"Poured from a bomber that I bought about 6 months ago. I have been intimidated by this beer for a long time since I realized shortly after buying it that I was not a big hops fan. I read the back of it and it said something to the effect of ""A liquid poem to the hops."" On to the review. Poured into my Samuel Smith pint glass.  A Great, generous head which stayed around for at least 3 minutes and as it dissipates there is a great lacing on the side of the glass. The body is a nice orageish brown with visible carbonation bubbles rising from below. A great look, really.  S Hops for sure but there is a balance that I can already appreciate. This does not seem to me that it is going to be completely unbalanced. Behind the hops I can smell some citrus. I am looking forward to tasting it (which I had not before typing those comments).  T Wow...hops in the front and the middle but then the finish is like a strong grapefruit type of bitterness without the sting of hops. Really, there is a nice citrusy taste that lingers. I feel like I am at a breakfast table with half a grapefruit in front of me. There is a warmness also (gained from the alcohol?). This is a heck of a taste. I will struggle with rating it though since I really do not prefer a huge kick of hops and I have never very much liked grapefruit which is a big part of this taste spectrum.  M Full, biting, busy.  D With tastes I do not much enjoy (hops bitterness and grapefruit citrus) I do not find it greatly drinkable.  Notes: I had no reason to be intimidated and neither should you. Maybe some day I will develop a taste for hops and then this beer will be right up there to represent one of the best hoppy beers, indeed a ""poem to the hops.""",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

M - Syrupy and drying. Thicker than it looks.  D - This is one of those intermediate beers that could get you into trouble.

S: A spicy, fruity, hoppiness of course. Bitter grapefruit, apples, and other citrus fruit. An odd aroma of perfume that does not mesh right. T: Spicy hop bitterness again. Kind of a muted hop flavor though. The bitterness is not over barring like some other DIPA I have had. A very light malt backbone. M/D: At first a snap of carbonation. A good creaminess follows as it warms up a bit. The high alcohol and bitterness always hurts the drinkablity for me.  This is really not bad. I am not a big fan of the style to say the least.

It poured slightly hazy dark orange amber with a full sticky off white head that settled into nice lacing after about 5 minutes. As it warms a bit, I detect a very nice orange and citrus aroma with a significant backbone of caramelized sugars and pungent juicy hoppyness. It tastes like hop nectar. Medium to full bodied, slightly syrupy, with sharp hop bitterness. I would call it medium sweet with a medium finish. The hops definitely dominate, but the rest of the brew has not fallen to the wayside. It's not completely dry like so many IPA's, but a delicious bold brew for sure!

Quite smooth upfront with a very strong, in your face hoppy bitterness throughout with a delightful hint of malty sweetness towards the end and an overall bitter finish. A decidedly citrus, almost peach flavor detected in the background.  I found this to have a great mouth feel, very smooth and refreshing.

M: Refreshing with a slight bite. Thin but not in a bad way. Not a lot of carbonation, but that may have been due to the pour since lots of froth was present.  D: I think it's very drinkable. The alcohol is not very noticeable. It drinks thinner with good flavor so it'd be a good session beer.

Nice white head, probably half an inch with decent retention.  The spices that hit you rnose when you hold it up to your face are admittedly enticing. Kind of a sweet and spicy scent to it, reminscent almost of white pepper  The taste follows the aroma, with an obviously high hop profile, I almost expected it to be legit spicy (like jalapeno chip spicy), but it wasn't. Bitter, something almost like the taste of rosebuds in the middle of the body.  Fairly smoothe brew, goes down easy. Drinkable, if it is to your taste.

Would buy this any day...money permitting.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,davexisxrabid,4.12,"Bought a 22 oz. bomber and poured most of it into my pint glass. Nice amber coloration, very clear with good carbonation and a thin white head that fizzles down pretty quickly.  The aroma was rather pleasant and smelled of grapefruit, sweet and sour bubblegum and honeysuckle. You can tell the complexity of the malts and hops were in there from the intense sweet and bitter characters fighting it out.  The taste was sort of a creamy grapefruit like flavor with a strong hop element throughout but far more pronounced at the end. Mild alcohol feel throughout. To be honest, I'm not a major hop-head and tend to shy away from brews with very high IBU's, but this offering from Stone was very pleasant and palatable.  This medium bodied ale had a full flavor with the citrus-like hops sticking around on your tounge and the carbonation wasn't overblown, so it feels like what a good IPA should feel like.  This beer is very drinkable and I was surprised, considering I've heard some of my friends say this ale was just to bitter for them. I found this ale smooth and although a bit too high abv to have more than one or two in a night, I'd happily sit back and enjoy sipping this brew for some time to come.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,gonzo46and2,4.2,"22oz bomber from the World of Beer in Westchase.  Pours a golden copper with a huge white head that stuck laces all over the glass and took a while to recede. This is a good indication of a well made IPA.  Aroma is full of citrus orange peel, grapefruit, lemon and lime. There was also a big smell of pine resin and malt. There is a lot of character in this beer.  Taste is very well balanced with a solid malt backbone and sweetness to cut the huge amount of hoppy taste.  Finishes strong and bitter.  This is easily one of my top 5 DIPAs.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,MrHurmateeowish,4.82,"12oz bottle from the liquor store in Tyngsborro, Mass. Pours a light amber-yellow body with an impressive inch and a half of off-white head. Smells intensely hoppy, like few beers I've had - citrus and pine most notably, with just a tinge of caramel malt in the background. Smells like smelling a packet of hops when homebrewing. Tastes like orange, grapefruit, pine, pith... Just the slightest hint of caramel malt, just enough to balance the flavor and make the beer obnoxiously bitter. Medium in body with ample effervescent carbonation, both of which help aid the drinkability. One sip most definitely invites another. Perhaps the best DIPAs I have ever had. An absolute must for any hop-head.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,stephens101,3.86,"A hazy golden orange pour supports three fingers of light tan head. Retention is excellent, with a prolific amount of spotted lacing left behind. Aroma consists of striking citrusy hops up front with a bit of astringency in the background. Notes of earth and pine float around. on the palate the hops are wrapped in a blanket of citrus and malt. They don't stand out as much as some DIPA's, but the balancing act here is pulled off perfectly, which results in a drinkable, yet very tasty example of the style. Mouth-feel is medium bodied. This one goes down pretty smooth, with an essence of orange peel as an aftertaste. This is a highly rated, and most talked about brew which, in my humble opinion does not quite live up to all the hype, but is for sure a good damn beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,dojobrewco,4.24,"My ""go to"" beer store normally doesn't have any of Stone Brewing Companies products but I saw a few cases of this stuff sitting on a cart and I took it upon my self to do a little downstocking. Anyway as i poured the brew in my pint glass I got the full floral aroma before I even put my nose to the edge of the glass. It's almost like a pine tree just fell on top of me. The appearance was nice as well glowing a nice amber/orangey hue thru the glass. If you like hops this is the beer for you. Not over done in anyway but like another review said the 100 IBU's is slightly questionable. I was expecting my tongue to just fall off from the bitterness but that wasn't the case. ruination IPA is a very drinkable beer and i will definately be partaking in some more very soon.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Shumista,4.25,"12 oz bottle into a Chimay goblet.  A- Ruination pours a thick, hazy, golden orange with a small amount of head. Lots of lacing sticks to the glass. S- Huge aroma, you don't even have to get your nose very close to it to smell it. Lots of citrusy hops and a noticeable sweet malt presence. T- Very nice flavor, not as overpowering as some DIPA's. Bitter citrusy hops, and a very strong malt presence. The hoppiness is noticeably a fruity hop taste. There is a lingering bitter aftertaste. M- Full-bodied ,thick, creamy, highly carbonated. D- Very, very high for a Double IPA, I could see myself going through 3 or 4.  I feel like that Stone, who I normally associate with over the top, in your face beers, shows some restraint with this one. Nothing in the taste is overpowering, and 7.7 percent alcohol is fairly low for a Double IPA. This is an excellent beer that I will definitely be buying again and again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,daledeee,4.38,Picked this one up in Wisconsin the other day.  Poured from the 22 oz bottle and found a nice dark reddish brown with a nice head. The aroma was floral with some hops.  This one is mostly a beautiful perfectly balanced blend of hops and malt. Not as hoppy as others but a nice change of pace. Very easy to drink with a warming finish and oily mouthfeel.  Topshelf stuff. Welcome to my refrigerator.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,HomebrewPgh,4.22,Awesome IIPA. Aroma was all hops. Strong citrus and pine. Pour wsa a nice deep orange with plenty of bubbles and a one finger off white head. Taste is strong and hoppy. Citrus and grapefruit with nice carbonation and just a hint of malt in the aftertaste. The carbonation makes this an extremely drinkable IIPA. It's not as thick and syrupy as most.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jkendrick,4.15,"Appearance: Golden color with some orange tints. Cloudy as one would expect. The head is nice with larger bubbles than I was expecting; not quite as creamy looking as I was expecting. The retention is fair to good, but there is decent lacing.  Aroma: Not as overpowering as many DIPAs, but is very nice. Some pine hints but mostly citrus. Very sweet smelling!  Mouthfeel: Very nice and creamy with even and ""small"" carbonation. The hops oils linger on the tongue while the carbonation push the bitterness across the taste buds.  Taste: There is an immediate malt presence that is very bready, but that is quickly overwhelmed by the ""100+ BTUs."" The hops, of course, is the defining flavor. Here its character is difficult to discern however. There is a little bit of pine, a little bit floral and a little bit citrus. The finish is very dry and the alcohol is very present. I would say you get a distinct series of flavors: malt to hops to alcohol. There is, however, an ever-present bitterness. It is just tad more bitter than I would like.  Overall impression: This is a very good DIPA. I would rank it behind some of my favorites though (my current favorite being Russian River's Pliny the Elder). I am a hophead and this brew has more malt and alcohol flavors than is optimal for me in a DIPA. And, as strange as it may sound, I like my hops a little less bitter. That said, I will definitely be drinking this on a regular basis, though a little goes a long way. As the bottle says there is an ""immediate ruinous effect on your palate."" You won't be tasting much for a while after this beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mnj21655,4.42,"12 oz. bottle.  Pours a golden orange in color with a bit over a finger of fluffy white head that has pretty good retention. Great aroma, hops seem to jump out of the glass. Citrus aromas dominate. Citrus might actually be a bit vague, its mostly oranges. Floral, pine and resin notes are also present. Taste is like the aroma but, in a way, its a bit more balanced. The citrus hops that dominated the aroma play a more complimentary role in the flavor but still dominate. Piney and resiny hops are more prominent here and really come to the fore towards the finish when the bitterness really hits. This beer is indeed solidly and strongly bitter but it doesn't seem like the 100+ IBUs the bottle claims. Mouthfeel is quite good, medium-light body with moderate+ carbonation. Drinkability is pretty darn good, this brew is very flavorful and enjoyable and a darn good representation of the style. I recommend buying this beer in bombers or sixers because a single 12 oz. bottle really isn't enough.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,GoodOldDuke,4.55,"As many of the BA population have come to expect this beer has just all the makings of a great brew. With a perfect white half inch head, that leaves a trail of gorgeous lace when it descends slowly into a slightly amber haze with caramel colored ribbons as the beer matures in the glass (a stein in my case). The smell of fruit and hops makes your mouth want for the bitter perfection that is this beer. So you drink, the taste is refreshing and full of variety, then the bite hits and you enter pure hop heaven. Glorious.  This beer is truly one of my favorites if you could not tell. I picked up my latest bottle at Consumre Beverage on Como Park in Lancaster, NY. They have an increasingly amazing selection, and their cooler is supremely cold. As always, this beer is best drank out of a heavy glass to let it breathe and to allow for a more wide and even entry into your mouth for feel.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,wescj,4.32,"22oz bottle poured into a snifter.  Pours thin and lightly cloudy, honey amber in color. Starts out with a decent half inch of head, which reduces to nothing but little whisps a bit too quickly. Lace is alright.  Aroma is excellent. Smells citrusy, specifically lemon. Nice hops, piney. A touch of alcohol.  Hops are first on the tounge, as expected. Palate isn't as ruined as I thought it would be, but in a very good way- tastes smooth, woody, but suprisingly malty. Very well rounded.  Mouthfeel is good and dry. Medium bodied, not over-carbonated.  Drinkable, despite the super-hops. Very good beer all around.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,JohnWaynes44,4.27,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle, a hazy copper with a beautiful frothy white head that sticks to the glass nicely. Retention was just average.  Wow, the nose is wonderful, floral and pine hop burst. Malt aroma comes through subtly at first and more noticeably after a few sips which leads me to the taste...  Very hoppy with the first drink. Bold, sharp and complex up front, lingering sharp pine taste. Malts come through at the end and stay there until the next drink. After several sips, the malts really become noticeable, very nice balance of bold hops and toasty malts. Alcohol is there but not overpowering, slightly warming though.   The mouth is rich with a pretty full body. Carbonation is just enough to help smooth out the bitterness of the hops.  I think this is very drinkable. Wish I hand a whole sleeve of it instead of just one. Overall, I love this brew. Hop lovers will really enjoy it obviously, but it has enough malts and balance and alcohol to appeal to many palates. Very well made.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Buebie,4.44,"Bottle courtasy of a friend on a road trip.  Poured from a 22 ounce bomber with no bottling date. Cellard for 3 months at 50 degrees. 2 finger foamy white head. Long lingering retention, with spotty drapes of lace. Color is a pale cloudy golden yellow. No transparency. The beer seems to glow even when not held to light.  Smell is rich, elegant buttery hoppy lingering aroma. Pinnaple, pine, pulling alcahol fumes with a rigerous swirl, fresh off the tree apples. I just want to keep sniffing this, I dont need to drink it.  Starts out sweet with earthy hop grassy flavor. Creamy laid back carbonation, very smooth and buttery with a mild oily texture. Through the middle alcahol bites and warms my pallett. Becoming increasingly bitter with a burst of pine and grapefruit hops. Finishing quite dry with a lingering hop flavor. A bit of minerally chalkieness, not in a bad way.  A great well balanced brew, each sensation, flavor and scent complimenting the other. Well done!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,midaszero,4.15,"A - Clear golden body with one finger of tan head that produces some okay lacing and doesn't go down to quickly  S - Very noticeable hop presence but a good fruit background to go with it that carries a little bit of sweetness  T - Huge hop flavor up front, hop bitterness in the middle followed by a mellowed out fruity hop mixture in the back. Not a lot of malts to pick up on but there existence is noted. The flavor could be a little more balanced and the alcohol presence comes on strong for a 7.7% ABV.  M - Medium body with medium carbonation a little sharp  D - Good to switch things up and overall enjoyable but not a main stay. If they could balance out the taste and hide the alcohol a little more this would be one of my favorite DIPAs.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,caddybuyer,4.5,"A- Medium lightly veiled light copper amber with a beautiful head and gorgeous lacing...(really, the head and lacing just kills me on this...it is the best)  S- Floral hops sweetness...a very slick sweet and enticing smell with a hint of alcohol and malt, of course....can a beer smell sexy? This is as close as it gets.  T- Incredible....floral, pastoral, creamy and well balance between hop and malt, woody, yet a tad of citrus...A whiff of perfume....can a beer taste sexy?...  M- well balanced as the taste and smell....the guys at Stone work magic on this....  D- What else can I say. I'm in love. I love IPA's, and this one throws all the others aside. Far more balanced than some other reviews may suggest...this is not a bitter beer...but clearly has an emphasis on the hops...hands down....This is not an extreme beer....This perhaps the best balanced DIPA known to man.

147,4083,lynx1245,4.1,"Appearance: Poured a dark amber with a nice 2 finger white pillowing head that receded fairly quickly leaving a thin layer of ""stratus cloud"" head. A very pretty amber; looks like honey.  Smell: Very sweet and heavy floral scent. The hops provide a very intense earthy aroma along with some citrus. Someone should bottle this and sell it as a perfume. ""Hey baby, you smell good enough to drink.""  Taste: ""A liquid poem to the glory of the hop!"" I'll admit it here first: I'm not the biggest hop head around. That being said, I love hops, but I usually don't reach for the hoppiest beers at the market. The hops bring a big punch in the bitterness department, but it is surprisingly balanced and not overwhelming like some other hop heavy beers I've had. It has a fresh lemony aftertaste as well.  Mouthfeel: Not a very heavy body. The bitterness is so well balanced that it isn't hard to go in for another sip.  Drinkability: This isn't a beer you will drink all night. That's pretty much to be expected though. One 22oz bottle sounds like it could do the trick. I still haven't finished it and I'm already feeling the 7.7%ABV.  Bottom line: If you love hops you will love this beer. If you don't, then why are you reading this review? It's an IPA. Still, excellent balance that I think anyone could enjoy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,MerkinMan,3.97,"A: Orange gold hue with head that looks like the surface of the moon. A little hop haze going on, which has me kind of excited.  S: Could smell it as soon as I popped the bottle. Citrusy hop aroma along with a hint of malty sweetness.  T: To cram this many hops in there and to have the beer still taste good is quite impressive. None of the soapy hop tastes I have experienced with some beers. The bittering hops and the flavor / aroma hops are separated well and show up after one another.  MF: Good body on this one. Lays down a nice blanket for the hops to dance on.  D: A good beer, but it would be tough to drink a lot of them. Certainly a good specimen for major hop loads. Better than others in the category.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Just passed 60 minute IPA on my top 5.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Larrytown,4.2,"The color is golden-orange with lots of lacing from top to bottom. Some sweetness in the nose with floral hops.  The hops are the first thing we notice in the taste, but once past the initial burst, the other flavors start coming through. More of a solid base than I first thought, no doubt.  Obviously we're dealing with a hoppy beer here, but for a DIPA, this is pretty well balanced. I don't see myself drinking a ton of them, but if I'm on a one-bottle night, this does the trick nicely.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,SickBrew,4.5,"Another great beer Stone Brewing.  Purchased this beer from By the Bottle, in Vancouver WA. Poured from a bomber into a pint class and marveled at the way the head formed. Almost reminded me of a certain nitrous beer. Head left loads of bountiful lacing on top of a great copper orange full bodied IPA! Aromas exploded into my nasal cavities with piny, flowery, citrus and just plain outstanding aromas. Taste definitely follow nose with a luscious, piny, dry, bitter, sweet, malty , caramel, acidic and altogether complex pallet sensation gong on. I would say complex is the operative word. Mouthfeel is medium with great carbonation. This beer is freak'n awesome!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,bigkahunas4,4.67,"Picked up this bomber, after this guy opened my eyes a year ago on tap. Don't see a date stamp anywhere on this, so hopefully it's fresh.  Poured into my snifter a gorgeous peach and apricot color, completely opaque. Head isn't big, but has some fierce bubbles along the side. Minimal suddy lacing.  Big fruity hop nose, that immediately had me ""MMMmmming"". Lots of grapefruit, but more to the fruity side - peach nose in addition to color? Upon airation, some floral hops bloom as well.  This brew completely bearhugs your tongue, with the occasional hook and jab. Lots of floral hopps flavors appear once it hits your tongue. Pallete moves to a sweet corn syrup from a well placed malt profile, before finishing up with some serious grapefruit. The sweet comes in at the perfect time for balance, but the brew leaves your with a final drop kick - reminding you of what the hell you're drinking. This beer doesn't go away, and continues to bite at your lips and tongue.  This beer is truly a bloody adventure, and one not to be drank unless you're in the mood. In terms of an extreme beer, this would probably get 5s across the board, but is just under perfect scoring due to the fact that you can't always just pick this up and drink it. It delivers on its promise. That said, I can't wait to stop typing and enjoy the rest of this...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Scent is strong fresh grapefruit and citrus, pine oil, orange peel, spicy and floral scents.  Taste is fresh grapefruit, orange and orange peel, spicy, peppery notes, and a bitter hop finish. There's a bready malt presence but lets be reasonable: this beer is about hops.  Mouth is creamy, juicy and slick with a nicely bitter finish and a slight hint of alcohol warming.  Drinkability is excellent, especially considering this is 7.7% ABV and 100+ IBU's.  This is a hell of an IPA. Juicy, fragrant, bitter, and delicious.

Mouthfeel is nice. The right amount of carbonation.  Drinkability. This is a very smooth beer, drinks really easily.

147,4083,walows,4.79,"I had this beer on tap at the Stone Brewery. This wonderful beer was brought to me in a nice goblet. This beer looks great, a nice caramel color, with a great off white head about two fingers. This beer laces all the way to the last drop. The aroma was nice and hoppy, floral and citrus with a tad bit of bread coming out toward the end. The taste was very bitter and delicious, this beer has a great layered hop character and a nice malty background that work great together. The bitterness was a good clean one and the hops come out as citrus and flowers. The great part of this beer is to taste all the different characteristics as the beer slowly warms up as you drink it. Once, the beer starts to get a little higher up in the temperature range this beer really opens up. Many of the hop oils and resins to come out, which adds another great dimension to this beer. The mouthfeel is great, a nice full body, with a slightly sticky feel from all the hops. Has mild carbonation, which works great with this beer. This beer has great drinkability, it is decent in alcohol but can still drink a couple of them. Wouldn't call this a session beer. I never get bored of this beer, this beer has so much to offer, from the first to last drop. The Stone Ruination is a great representation of a double IPA my and is my favorite beer.

Color is a clear honey-golden, and off-white head is thick and fairly persistent. Flavor is ferociously hoppy and quite bitter, but has a hint of sweetness and even a bit of fruity taste. Texture is fairly smooth, but it still goes down with an attitude and leaves a pleasantly bitter, hoppy aftertaste.

It doesn't get better than this.  Sharp on the palate, but not as ruinous as the name may lead you to believe. Very nice pine needle resin character mellowing to a citrussy, but lightly sweet palate. This then dries out, leaving a prolonged refreshing bitterness. Complex and long, but no ruination. It's big and tasty though.

Meant this to be my 100th, but a stop to Stoudts preempted that, still 101 ain't a bad spot either.  A: Pours a gorgeous orange color with a terrific head that laced the heck out of the glass. This one is thick through and through.  S: Big, complex hop profile. I can pick up everything from nice floral notes to big citrus to very smooth pine resin. Aroma announces the above-standard qualities of this ale.  T: Big and complex with a huge hop flavor mixed reasonably with some very attractive malts and a good caramel sweetness for balance. The hops are very floral and mixed with a pinch of table sugar and a six-inch grapefruit wedge.  M: Full in the mouth and incredibly smooth. Great balance and texture provides a great experience.  D: Awesome, awesome, awesome. Stone has another winner (no surprise) and here's a brew that rivals their standard IPA. This is a staple of the brew world and one you should make your way to find.

I love everything about it all i can say is everything from apperance to drinkability is almosty perfect.  great taste and not too harsh for a double IPA, yes alot of people will say this should have a lot more alcohol for a DIPA but i dont mind that the alcohol is a little lower for the style.  This is a double ipa that you can actually drink a few of and enjoy them unlike some double ips that have 15% ABV and have a very harsh and heavy taste to them.  Great beer Stone brewing thank you for this wonderfull beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BamaBeerBuff,4.42,"A: Pours a brilliant golden-orange color with a massive head that takes forever to settle, leaving some sticky lace on its way down. Retention throughout is not as spectacular, but everything else looks great.  S: Best nose on a DIPA I've ever experienced. A pungent, perfume-like aroma of pine, citrus, and floral hops. Some fruitiness and slight twinge of alcohol, as well. The alcohol is actually a complement to the hop aroma, however. This is one of those ""I wish this was an air freshener"" aromas.  T&M: Flavor is interesting--some herbal and grassy hops, some notes of citrus, and a good smattering of pine. There's also a kind of buttery flavor. It's intense and bitter, but with a nice toasted flavor, as well. It doesn't seem to be as balanced as Stone IPA, but it's still pretty tasty. The mouthfeel is very nice--a sticky, full, and lasting feel with a long finish.  D: It goes down pretty easily, as it's lighter than some of the bigger bodied DIPAs. Lower alcohol for a DIPA, too. I wouldn't probably session with this beer, but I did drink it in gulps rather than sips.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,superdedooperboy,4.07,"Finally, after Oktoberfest's completion, I got the chance to sample the bottle that had been sitting in my fridge for two weeks.  Poured a golden hue with bubbles of CO2 making a moderate appearance and developing a small half-finger, slightly off-white head that left relatively little lacing along the sides of the pint glass.  A wonderfully fruity, floral hop bouquet was a very welcoming fragrance.  As the beer washed over my tongue, I was assaulted by a huge hop wallop. Slightly sweet malt mixed with fruity flavors hit the front of the palate, mixing with heavy sour and bitter hop notes on the middle and back, and the finish was long and bitter. Medium-to-full in body with just enough carbonation to make it almost refreshing (the bitterness kind of kills the refreshing factor).  Drinkability is superb if you're a hophead, but the fairly high ABV and high bitterness may scare off many.  Overall, highly recommended. I was craving a beer that would ruin my palate after the swath of malty-sweet Oktoberfest beers I consumed over the past sixteen days.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,tkarsies,4.4,"My wife brought this home for me the other day saying she hoped I'd be OK with it. Anyway, it was served cool in a pint glass.  Appearance is nice--a clear gold with some orange undertones. Beige 1-finger head that leaves lots of lacing.  Smell is hops, hops, and more hops.  Taste is more of the same. HOPS! This is exactly what I was looking for in a DIPA. There is a malt backbone that keeps things from getting out of balance.  Medium mouthfeel with some carbonation but not too much.  As others have said, the alcohol does become noticeable. However, the bomber was easy to finish. This is definitely a beer I turn to when I need hops. It was a nice change from the malt-dominant Octoberfests and stouts I have been working on recently. Now if only I can figure out how to get my wife to bring this home every day...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,watkins,4.52,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle  A: Pours a honey-amber with one finger head that dissipates. Lacing is great.  S: Beautifully rich, floral, fruity hop scent off the rip. Also some alcohol and a little malt sweetness hanging in the background.  T: Holy crap. Hops from hell. But that's a good thing. Like the jokingly pompous description, its not for beginners, and will destroy the palette. Less ""dry"" than the Stone IPA, with a little more sweetness and depth. What I'd want from Stone.  M: Crisp, medium bodied, with some help from the alcohol and hops tearing away at the tongue. Very smooth, however, for what it is.  D: Not even halfway through this beast on a rather empty stomach, and already slowing down. Could have 3 or 4 on a good day, but the alcohol definitely gets you. I would definitely recommend this beer over the IPA though.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BravoTwo,4.12,"A - Nice light copper with a smallish white head, decent lacing due to the hops content.  S - Hops. Nice floral, piney, citrusy hops. Very perfumy and full nose  T - Balanced with very bready thick malt notes, but the hops is also very pronounced. More balanced than some other DIPAs with full flavors across the spectrum.  M - Crisp yet creamy and very full bodied  D - Depends on your enjoyment of the style. For me very drinkable and tasty DIPA that is a well balanced but aggressive brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,morimech,3.68,"Has an amber color with two inches of white head that has excellant retention. Heavy lacing is left on the glass surface.  Big citrus hop aroma. A little alcohol is also detected in the aroma.  The flavor is dominated by the bitterness of the hops. Citrus is there with just a hint of caramel malt. Some alcohol warming on the finish.  Has a nice silky texture. Medium body and low carbonation.  One of these and my tongue is all ready dead from the bitterness. If you want bitter, look no further. Not a big citrus rush like some other DIPAs.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,elniko,4.62,"Poured from bottle into snifter.  A: Almost glowing rich amber coloring, small amount of head with nice lacing. Really nice looking brew.  S: Wow, cannot imagine an IPA smelling better than this. Strong wonderful grapefruit and citrus tones. Gotta rate as a 5.  T & M: Deezam, this is one hoppy brew. Does not have some of the sweetness that I've had in other recent Imperial IPA tastings. The hops are what this beer is all about but with a small balance of malt and grapefruit and citrus tones. Mouthfeel is wonderful, full with strong sense of hops that lingers after sipping.

147,4083,ewright,4.23,"A: Clear golden hued with hints of orange. A fluffy head of coarse bubbles forms on top, then recedes slowly leaving nice lacing on the glass.  S: Lots of orange peel aroma from the abundant hops. Hints of tropical fruit and bread hide in the background.  T: Bitterness smacks you on the front of the tongue, roof of the mouth, and back of the tongue before prickling the throat late. This beer is unabashed about its IBUs. Sharp notes of citrus peel and mint from the hops overwhelm the palate, but as the beer warms on the tongue, some faint grainy notes from the malt appear.  M: Brutal bitterness creates a lot of tingling all over the mouth. Moderate carbonation levels help keep the flavor light enough to prevent palate fatigue too quickly.  D: This beer lives up to its name, making a bomber something to stretch out a bit longer than most IPAs. This is not for the weak of heart or tongue.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,EnojysAnyBeer,4.45,"A- Clear IPA color with a great head with plenty of lacing  S- Smells like HOPS. So much hoppiness that I almost believe I'm smelling an extract of hop oil.  T- Taste is crazy floral, piney, crisp hops slightly balanced with a powerful sweet malt backbone.  M- Slick and resiney with a moderate body and decent carbonation  D- Too bold to be perfectly drinkable, but still quite enjoyable even in large quantities",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,cvstrickland,4.8,"12-ounce bottle poured into a large tulip glass yields a body the color of brushed golden amber lighter than I expected, capped with a fat finger's depth of soft and creamy milk-white foam. The head settles slowly to a chunky sheet that leaves a few thin rings of lacing on the glass.  The smell is grapefruity, sweetly floral and piney with a dash of lime zest and charred wood.  The taste is like a pleasant kick in the face. Grapefruity and otherwise citrusy hop flavors and hardcore bitterness vie with a sticky, reeking, herbal character. A thin body of caramel-sweet malt provides a base for the ass-kicking, tongue-numbing hop-bombery. A pleasantly-ashy burnt flavor, succulent flowers, a dash of orange, and more simple-syrup sweetness emerge as the drink progresses.  Medium-bodied with fine carbonation, Ruination has redefined for me what a Double India Pale Ale ought to be. With a silky, creamy feel, it fits my palate, and I mean just right. A strange and wonderful brew, this Stone stuff is...fantastically hoppy, big and badassed, but I have to check myself to keep me from gulping it. With drinkability akin to liquid crack, I proclaim this brew a personal benchmark, a style-definer, a pacesetter, a miracle of modern hopping, a god-send.  Thank You Stone may I have another!?!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,kuranes,3.87,"22 oz. bomber poured into a pint glass.  A: Goldeny amber with a frothy, light head. S: Hoppy with lots of pine and citrus notes. Smells freaking good. T: Bitter and hoppy with some citrusy sweetness and tang. A well-done beer, but I'm not as impressed as many other reviewers. To me, the hoppiness is more one-dimensional than what I envision in the idea IPA. I thought abv was masked pretty well. Not a lot of malt going on here, either. M: Creamy without being thick. Impressive. D: Though bitter, it goes down easy. We all know about high-gravs. I don't think being drunk after 22 oz. is a bad thing.  I would recommend this beer to anyone who enjoys the hoppy beers. However, it could be more complex and I would like to taste more maltiness to balance its bitterness. Still, it's pretty freaking good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,boralyl,4.64,"A - Pours one finger of white head that leaves a small amount of lacing and has an ok retention. It pours a cloudy golden orange.  S - Caramel malt and lots of pine and citrus hops make up the aroma.  M - A medium bodied brew. Lightly carbonated and pretty smooth.  T - It starts out with some floral hops, followed by citrus hops, and then some piny hops. The malt kicks in to help balance the hops creating a nice smooth taste. It finishes slightly bitter.  A delicious big IPA. It is very smooth and drinkable. Hops heads will love it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Hollenbeck2,4,"what a great beer, 4's across the board, this bad boy poured a deep autumn brown, with the head lightening up to a citrus orange.  great bitterness, hung around long enough to notice but did not dominate the taste, stone did it again with this excellent brew.  highly recommend as a series tasting if tasting ipa's from the west coat, this is a must.  the mouthfeel was good almost that of a winter warmer beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,cktison,4.52,"Stone finally made the trek out to Atlanta, wonderful.  A: Golden, orange, slight haze. Beautiful off-white head, little retention. Does not have the stickiness I expected on the wall, but some nice lacing. Lighter than expected. S: Hops. Literally a wall of hops. Pine, citrus, hoppy hops. T: Bitter, hoppy citrus, pine and a nice malt backbone. To me, there's almost a hint of mint in it. Very clean, but strong and up front. It's delicious, a beer you can think about while you taste it. Starts floral, enter the hops, malt smooths it and makes it drinkable, then the bitterness off the hops lingers. D: This is a delicious, huge IPA. Well balanced, but strong - you're only having 1 or 2 of these.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,timmah427,4.47,"Finally in Texas!! I've been waiting a while to try this one.  A - Hazy light copper with a nice 2-finger fluffy copper head that settles down after a minute, but stays with the beer. Leaves nice sheets of lacing.  S - The smell blew my mind. Smells like opening a bag of fresh hops on brew day. Pungent citrusy hop smell and a bit of pine.  T - More hops. Quite bitter, with tons of citrus and pine. I almost couldn't find any malt in this one, but a tiny bit of sweetness is there.  M/D - Not quite as much mouthfeel as I would expect from a DIPA, but not bad. Quite drinkable as long as you love hops.  Overall, this one was delicious. There's not a whole lot that would set it apart from other quality DIPAs, but it's really good nonetheless. I basically felt like I was chewing on fresh hops. I will keep this beer in mind when I need a good hop fix.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ralree,4.82,"A: Very clear gold with a nice fluffy white head.  S: Very grapefruity, quite a bit of alcohol, a little sugary. Smells like a winner.  T: Very hoppy - great flavor. Grapefruit balances it out nicely. Alcohol is present, but balanced and very tolerable. This is a wonderful-tasting ale.  M: Coats the mouth, very creamy. Non-astringent. Medium-bodied.

147,4083,Cresant,4.08,"Received two successive pints at O'Sheas's Pub. Apricot body with an active bead. Slightly hazy. The head was stoic, persisting throughout. Sheets of white lace were clinging to the glass.  Smell was difficult to assess fully due to being outdoors. Some citrus and pungent hops presence.  Taste was divine. Oily hops. Light astringency. Grassy, green. Citrus, pineapple and resiny hops with some sweet malt to attempt some countering flavor. Served in a room temperature pint glass. Very enjoyable.  Mouthfeel was also oily and moderate bodied. Adequate carbonation.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,erikm25,4.95,"A: Pours a rich golden Herculean copper smoked orange with subtle amber highlights. I didn't turn the lights out but this probably glows in the dark. You could solidify it, then melt it down, forge it into gold coins, and it would be accepted as legal tender worldwide. The head is comprised of tightly nestled white bubbles that as a thriving community resonate into a chorus of huge foaming copper. Lacing is absolutely abundant, frothing, and sticking all over the glass.  S: This has to be smelled to be believed. Like being in a lush forest and having trees hold you down with their tentacle branches and bleed fresh pine tar and sap right into your nostrils. A kaleidescope of flowers combined with a bouquet of malts. This aroma reminds me of God's most pure and persecuted plant.  T: Massive hops but with sweet honey qualities. Grapefruit, citrus, lemon, and pine resin are all perfectly represented in this nectar. A flavorful peppered caramel and cinnamon malted backbone of sweetness with an intricate pineapple and citrus vertebrae. Overall this is very complex, rounded, and bitter. The alcohol is only present in that nice warm feeling that follows.  M: Very creamy and full. Excellent carbonation. So good in the mouth you want to keep it there as long as a piece of gum.  D: This is the one that opened my eyes to the world outside of mainstream beers. Despite that personal bias the reviews do not lie. Overall this beer is like an amusement park. Scaring your taste buds in the bitter fun house and numbing the mouth on the hoppy tilt-a-whirl . In a perfect world I would make this a daily indulgence.

T - Holy f**king moses citrusy hops that completely blows my mind... almost like drinking straight citric acid at first. powerful pine on the aftertaste and subsequent burps (my favorite). Goes great with a mellow but diverse flavored pizza (Mighty Isis at Crust).  M - Light on the palate, clean finish. Could have used a bit more carbonation but it was a pleasant IPA presence.

147,4083,marcpal,3.72,"Pint poured on tap at Sunset Tap in Brookline.  A: Mustard yellow color with a thin head that was short lasting. Thin lacing and patchy lacing thinned out as well.  S: Potent pine needles and other earthy flavors are abundant. There is a malt balance in the nose that didnt carry over so much into the taste. Sweet citrus came from a combination of the sugars and the bitters.  T: Smack of the hops, not balanced all that well by the malt. Earthiness completely takes over with a smack in the face over and over from a pine tree. The alcohol is clearly there but the bitterness is all that leaves you with in terms of the taste.  M: Somewhat chewy with middle of the road carbonation. Oily on the back end, viscous.  D: I love hops as much as any hop head but this one could use more balance. Overbearing levels here from the type of piney hops, would like more rounded flavors.  Love Stone's stuff, but this isnt a favorite offering of mine from their shop.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S: As you'd expect, this beer smelled strongly of hops, but also had a pleasant fruity quality as well.  T: Very hoppy, very bitter flavor - it says 100 IBU's on the bottle and it's not kidding. Flavor also has some citrus in it, giving it a lively quality.  M: Lots of carbonation and a smooth finish. Full-bodied.  D: This is an excellent IPA. It's well constructed, tasty and complex.

Not that bitter, which is amazing given the IBUs  M: Nice creamy mouthfeel with a nice pleasant carbonation.  D: Very drinkable, which means it's really dangerous at 7.7% abv  An awesome San Diego style IPA. I compare this with the Port 2nd Anniversary I just had and this one just has cleaner, more balance flavor profile. Very much recommended for IPA fans.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,PatrickJR,3.96,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into nonic pint glass.  A - Clear, somewhere between gold and amber. About a finger of head rises with some fairly short retention, though a cap remains. Moderate to minimal lacing.  S - Very nice. Lots of pine upfront, with a big herbal background suggesting rosemary and mint. Citrus is evident as well, though in much smaller amounts. A small but complimentary malt element balances things nicely.  T - The hops hit quickly with a very herbal/grassy quality, though not as much nuance as I detected in the nose. The malt keeps things sweet until mid palate when a soapy, citric flavor kicks in and starts to bitter things up. Earthy flavors finish things off with a very pronounced bite from the alcohol. In fact, this makes the brew seem a lot stronger than 7.7%. There's a lot of bitterness, but it's quite managable and never quite goes over the top. Long lingering bitterness with a touch of mint in the aftertaste.  M - On the light side of medium bodied, with moderate to high carbonation. Not what I expected or what I'm used to, but it defintely did the job.  D - The bitterness and the alcohol burn detract from this some what. Though not as big and bold as a lot of DIPAs out there, it strikes a nice balance and becomes a somewhat sessionable DIPA if there is such a thing.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ffejherb,4.5,"22oz. bomber into Troegs Hopback glass on 9/22/08  A - Slightly hazy golden/light orange body with one-finger creamy white head that settled into a quarter inch of retention and left sticky lace around the glass. Plenty of active carbonation bubbles present.  S - Perfumy and floral hops dominate the aroma at first, followed by a bit of resin and citrus rind thrown in for good measure, the latter being primarily grapefruit. There's a very slight buttery diacetyl aspect, but barely noticeable through the thick, overgrown humulus lupulus forest, so it doesn't really detract from the flavor. Some alcohol seeps its way into the mix as well. Malt? Not much save for trace amounts of bread and sweet caramel.  T - At first, the hops seem rather tame. After a few subsequent sips, I begin to feel the sting of a wicked blend of hops. The profile is quite intense, and includes piles of resinous hops, juicy grapefruit, bitter citrus rind and more subtle hints of perfume and floral hops. Malt content is barely existent, although there is a smidgen of caramel malt trying to scratch its way to the surface. There is a bit of a grainy aspect in the finish that attempts to ease the brutal effects of the hops.  M - Medium body with an oily texture and bristly mouthfeel. The combination of the aggressive hopping and lively carbonation creates a short, prickly burst over the palate, reminiscent of pop rocks candy (remember that stuff?). I can actually feel the sensation as if the tastebuds were being lanced off my tongue one by one. Yet I keep drinking! This one will definitely give you a numb tongue.  D - Wow! After the first sip, I thought, ""Yeah, it's not THAT hoppy."" Into the second sip, I was like, ""OK, there's the hops...nice!"" By the fourth sip or so, I was definitely feeling the hops pummel my palate into oblivion. For those who have not developed a taste for aggressive hop bitterness, this is definitely NOT a good IPA to begin with. This is definitely up there among the hoppiest brews I've ever consumed. Now I can say that Stone has officially ruined me!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,beerkittycat,4.64,"Appearance is a fierce amber-orange with a minimal off-white head. Good lacing. While very cloudy at first this beer cleared a bit as it warmed. A strong aroma of fresh hops fills my nose with orange, grapefruit, pine, and mint. The taste is almost too complex to describe. Multiple flavors of fresh hops and malt dance around. The malt is rich and yet velvety. The hops are luscious but not harsh for such a highly hopped beer. Stone has pulled off one of the most difficult brewing techniqes out there. A balanced, yet not harsh, double IPA. THE best example I've ever tried of this style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,taylorhamrick,4.44,"I poured a 22 oz bottle into a goblet.  As soon as I opened the bottle, the most wonderful aroma came to me. It was centennials, one of the best hops I've ever smelled and tasted, and I think there's another in there, it would be tough to push a beer to 100+ IBUs with only centennial, but the whole bottle and the beer in the glass smell like opening a bag full of fresh hops. It pours amber colored with a decent head, not the biggest, but that's perfectly find for this beer. When you taste it, I can't think of a comparison (from any of the beers I've ever gotten in SC) in terms of hoppy beers. There's nothing astringent to it, just a crisp flavor with a clean, beautiful bitterness, and it's surprisingly balanced, though the malt definitely gets no spotlight. You know from the name that this beer is ruinous for your mouth, but I actually loved it. I had the taste in my mouth for an hour, just drinking water that tasted like hops, but its certainly not a great thing if you're trying to do anything else.

It smells more like an actual flower than a beer. Also a bit like fresh bread, just a great smell.  The bitterness is not as Ruinous as I anticipated. Must be balanced by a boatloat of malt. Grapefruit, biscuit, yeast and alcohol are all present as well. Mmmm.  Mouthfeel slick, medium carbonation.  Stone just came to town 2 days ago, but I'm already a believer. This was well balanced and delicious. Highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Taste delivers, with a nice bitter flavor (although it seems to finish with a very slight metallic off flavor). This beer is delicious and one of my new favorites. I would place very close to Two Hearted Ale, although it is currently much more expensive in NC.  Extremely drinkable. The alcohol is well masked, although I think categorizing this as a ""double IPA"" is a little misleading given it's under 8%.

147,4083,MrHungryMonkey,4.49,"Nose is decidedly hoppy. It rides the citrus train heavily. Also nice and leafy fresh with herbal/earthy must. If my eyes were closed, I might be sniffing strait into a fresh-from-the-freezer bag of pungent hops. Really smells like nature, like a plant, kind of like dirt. Good show.  Pours a medium-dark yellow with tangerine highlights, good clarity, and a good-sized head with 3 minute retention and a lasting crema and sexy lacing.  First sip shows off the wonderfully creamy body. There's some malt, wouldn't have known from the aroma. Plenty of hop flavor, of course, and near the finish the corresponding hop bitterness - the kind that's harsh and grassy and tastes like something green and leafy that's supposed to be good for you but you don't like it - that isn't my favorite, but it's pert-near unavoidable in such circumstances as a good, strong IPA. The malty and sweet flavor play near the attack. Very creamy and supple, they are in each sip savagely overcome by the bitter clouds of darkness. All throughout the sip-cycle are the hop flavors, too many to number and too fluid to pin down. Most notably I get the nose's citrus that comes across feeling like a grapefruit and tasting a little more like an orange... no, maybe more like the grapefruit. Now it almost tastes like an orangecreamsicle with distinct vanilla and sugar flavors. Completely dry. Medium-thick body.  Maybe my mouth is adapting, but it seems less bitter with warmth.  The 6th from my pack, this is the only bottle I really truly enjoyed. I had the previous bottles with my review-hat off and they were just so-so.

The head eventually dropped to a thin skim, leaving behind huge sheets of sticky lace.  S= This was dominated by huge hop aroma, with potent grapefruit citrus, pine, and medicinal and sharp alcohol esters. The malts were definitely in the backseat on this one.  T= This ale started off bitter and just kept getting more intensely bitter throught each swallow! With very little malty sweetness or grain presence, this is basically a delivery vehicle for hop bitterness with an alcohol filled finish. Having said that, it was obvious that there was many layers to the hops in this beer and it still came across as well done.  MF= Medium bodied with a light-moderate carbonation level.  D= I love hops but even I thought this was a disturbingly dry and bitter beer. Having said that, it would pair well with big foods and is a testament to the skills of the Stone brewers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,trbergman,4,"22 oz bomber poured into a Hennepin flute.  Appearance - Pours a light ruby color with a tall off-white head that falls to a quarter-inch of dense foam. Great lacing.  Smell - Loads of American hop aroma, mostly pine but citrus is also present. Some caramel notes from the malt are hiding in the background.  Taste - This beer hits you over the head with hops and doesn't let go. The pine and grapefruit from the nose take center stage in the taste as well. Sharp bitterness lasts from first sip to finish, but malts make an appearance in the middle with hints of caramel and toffee. The finish is dry, with long-lasting hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel - In the middle for the style, with some astringency from all the hops.  Drinkability - A bit boozy, the alcohol is not all that well hidden.

An incredibly strong hop smell buttressed with some citric and spice notes along with hints of malt. While a very dry beer, it maints a smoothness to it and was kind of creamy and fluffy...a very filling beer in the mouth. Not only is there a warming sensation to this beer, but it gets smoother as it warms (it's a sipper) and not only do the hops (mostly citric and earthy) continually poke out but there are some underlying malts, a little sweet in my opinion, in there as well. Another quality IPA from Stone; although true to its name, don't plan on having different beers and adding this to the mix b/c your taste buds will be dulled for a long time.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Appearance: Pours a hazy, pale gold with massive four-finger head. Head is eggshell-colored and extremely soapy. Absolutely outstanding lacing and retention! A sprinkling of bubbles sneak toward the top of the glass throughout the session.  Smell: Citric hops, pine, caramel, rising bread, and a touch of alcohol. My mouth is watering!  Taste: Roasted caramel malts are quickly followed by citric hops and pine. Hop bitterness absolutely smashes the palate. Overall taste is rather plain. I used to love this beer, but now I see it more as a novelty. Good, but way too bitter with not much complexity.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and creamy with excellent mouth coating (which can be a bad thing due to the ""ruining"" effect). Medium carbonation as well.  Drinkability: If you're only drinking Ruination, it's a 5. However, true to it's name, it ruins all other beers that follow. I could drink these all night... if I were rich. So, the fact that I can't drink many of these in succession lowers drinkability to a 4. Sorry Stone. This is one of my two favorite beers of all time (along with Old Rasputin). A must try!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,botham,4.05,"12 oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. pours a crystal clear, golden amber color wth two fingers of thick, off-white head that remains for a few minutes, and leaves rocky lacings.  aroma is quite hoppy, with citrusy hops in front and mild coniferous hops in the background. little lese for the nose.  taste is citrusy up front, with a heavy hop quality, along with a finish of bitter and coniferous hops that drowns out any chance of malt or yeast presence. the brew is quite powerful in its bitterness, and the lingering aftertaste of citrusy hops is no exception.  mouthfeel is full bodied and quite bitter on the palate, killing any chance of further tasting. bitter upon finishing.  drinkability is good. this is a palate killing brew in its bitterness and hop quality. that being said, the hops are nicely mixed and well proportioned with respect to one another. it still would have been nice to see some malt mixed in to play off of the hops.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mattffrost,4.42,"22 oz bottle poured into glass.  A- Beer is a unclear dark amber. Head is offwhite that leaves lacing on the glass. I look at it and my first thought is honey.  S- Nice Hop smell, Citrus/Lemon/Grapefruit, fruity.  T- Carmel, some fruity/Citrus sweentness but not to fruity. A nice bitterness at the end of swallowing. I have had other IPA's which are more fruity this is a nice contrast to that.  M- Carbonation is great not to much not to little. The slight bitterness is nice on the mouth to me.  D- Very, Very good IPA. Not to heavy but not to fruity a couple of pints of this stuff is just splendid. Very Refreshing.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,PittBeerGirl,4.15,I've had this on-tap before but never reviewed it. Poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass (because my snifter is dirty).  A-Mildly translucent pale amber body that pours with a 2 finger foamy off-white head. It fades to one finger eventually but retains well from there and leaves some lacing behind in the glass. Translucency is minimal and uniform.  S-Citrusy hops (particularly grapefruit) come through as the main character in this brew. The nose is quite bright. A hint of spicy hops come through underneath. I don't really smell any malt.  T- Lots of grapefruit upfront with an overshadowed but detectable caramel malt backbone. The citrus intensifies for the finish and a hint of pine and caramel malt sweetness can also be detected here. Left to linger is everything mentioned and a small but persistent resiny hop bitterness.  M-Beautiful DIPA mouthfeel with low carbonation. Oily and slick but not heavy and very smooth.  D- I really like this one and think it is a very good DIPA. I will certainly have it again. I can certainly see why people like this so much and it is one I would love to try on cask. Because the character of this brew isn't all that strong strong its very drinkable. Really-there's nothing to not like about this beer. I know my rdev will be way below the norm...which is because I do really like this beer but I'm not blown away.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,unionturf,4.42,"Received on trade from Hygmod..thanks!  Poured into pint glass and appearance was a slightly hazy orange. Smell is hops, hops, hops. Taste is sorta like sucking on a grapefruit, which I like. ;) Taste and mouthfeel are good, bitter hop but not thick and syrupy like some other DIPA's that I had to pour out.  Drinkabily is very good as long as my tastebuds can handle it. Can't wait till next Thursday and have it on tap finally!!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,philipquarles,2.18,"I guess I'll be the dissenter here...  Pours a very nice hazy amber with a thick white head, as it should with the hop presence. Decent retention, though the head eventually disappears to leave some very nice lacing. The aroma is obviously largely hoppy, with quite a bit of citrus in the background. On the palate, the bitterness is extreme. I'm getting light hints of dish soap (and it's not the glass). Really unbalanced, even for its style.  I like IPAs well enough, along with the occasional DIPA, but this is an unbalanced hop bomb.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,chrisafari,4.26,"Pours light amber orange with thin white head. Sweet aroma of citrus, hops and nice pine. Flavor begins citrusy and roasty sweet and finishes with a great dry kick of hops. Leaves the throat nice and dry, like a good double IPA should. Ruination is always a winner in my book, one of my favorites.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,brdc,3.63,"Large capped bottle, poured into a tulip.  Nice looking, golden body with a foamy white head, average retention and lacing. Aroma is hoppy as expected, citrusy, with grapefruit and orange being the predominant individual scents. However, it does not feel as pungent or fresh as I would expect; unfortunately, the lack of ""bottled on"" date can only make me guess if this is the way it is supposed to be, or this is not that fresh. Body is amazingly light for such a high ABV; taste is hops, hops and more hops, but not always in a positive way. There are little malts to provide any balance, and the hops provide a lot of bitterness, some resinous aftertaste, but other than grapefruits, not much to talk about. A nice hop assault for the ones who like it, but it is unidimensional. There are plenty of better balanced DIPAs out there, IMHO.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mcfisty,4.88,"Thank you beer gods for sending this to the great state of Texas. Appearance= very clear copper colored liquid capped with two fingers of off white foam. Nice legs of carbonation darting upward. Lacing is very sticky down the glass.  Aroma= Very nice pine and grapefruit hop notes, not as pungent as I remember from a few years ago. Some bready malts and slight caramel notes. Extremely pleasant  Flavor= Grapefruit and citrus hop flavors accompanied perfectly by the malt backbone. Bitterness is perfectly balanced in this one.  M= Creamy mouthfeel, medium bodied, such a pleasant drinking experience. Nothing is out of place or balance at all.  D= This one could get you into trouble. Alcohol totally hidden, Sip after sip just gets better and better without weighing your tongue down too much.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,toweringpoo,4.57,"I haven't had this beer for a long time so I didn't really remember how it was. So, I'll write a review this time around. This is my first hop monster in a looong time (not by choice, mind you). So I was looking forward to it quite a bit. I almost forgot what hops taste like living in Japan. That taste? Good. Real f'n good.  Dark reddish amber color, fluffy thick off-white head. It sticks around for a bit and leaves nice lacing. The smell is possibly the best part of this beer. Strong citrusy, piney, delicious, ""drink me now"" smell. Taste is similar with a very strong dry bitter finish. I wish I had 5 more of these.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,bort11,3.88,"big thanks to nfr5069 for this one.  22 oz bomber poured into a Boulevard Smokestack goblet. This off white head stands a fingers width. Flecks of lace. Color is a hazy orange.  Smell is predominantly citrus hops with a balancing toasty malt. Taste is not overly hopped like a lot of Stone beers. Yes, there is a lot of hops, but it's not hitting me over the head. Very balanced out with the malt. It's a bit more on the citrus sweet side.  Mouthfeel is a solid medium body, with goo carbonation crispness. Very solid and approachable DIPA",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,enso,4.55,12 oz. bottle poured into a brandy snifter. Freshness date 9.16.08  Appearance: Hazy tawny golden hue. A shallow yet dense head which persists for a few moments. Plentiful carbonation bubbles.  Aroma: Like standing in the hop yard at harvesting time holding a freshly baked steaming sweet bread. Glorious pungent floral citrus and bready malt sweetness.  Flavor: Sweet malt up front quickly followed by citrusy-herbal bitterness and then resiny-piney bitterness coating the tongue. Each sip renewing the taste buds and repeating the cycle.  Mouthfeel: Good foundation for the plentiful hops and malt. Leaves a not unpleasant coated feeling on the tongue and mouth. Perhaps a protective layer from the dense bittering properties of the hops which enables the ability to appreciate the many nuances of the hops without becoming overly taste fatigued.  Overall: A wonderful beer. As ruinous as they claim it to be to the taste buds it is anomalously balanced in its own right. Perhaps best enjoyed at the end of a tasting session. I could drink numerous pints without taste bud fatigue but realize other beers would have a hard time following this one. Highly recommended.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mjryan,4.24,Pours a very nice clear deep gold. Smells like hops. Tons of fresh floral/citrusy Cenntenial hops. Tastes like tons of fresh floral/citrusy Centennial hops. Sweet malt keeps it relatively balanced. Has a bracing bitterness that is not unpleasent. Mouthfeel is moderatly viscous with a smooth carbonation. Alchohol is not detectable. At 7.7% this is small for a DIPA wich is not a bad thing. Very and drinkable and very good. Wish I had access to it all the time.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,prsguitarsr4me,4.75,"One of the best beers I've had recently. Everything about it is top-notch. The blend of hops and alcohol and everything is perfect - not like most IPAs.

Highly recommended!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,THEBEERBAR0N,4.3,"Bomber poured into a pint glass with vigor. This produced a half finger a bubbly head which left a complete ring of lacing around the glass. This beer is a nice golden color.  Ooh the smell is funky strong hops- skunky, piney, slightly lemonish and complex.  Hops fix-check. Definitely more on the skunky side of the hops spectrum with lemons coming through as a backbone. Malts begin this advanture with buttery toffee flavors. Alcohol finish is noticeable but in balance. The hops taste sticks with you like a fat belly in the holidays. This beer makes me happy!  Moutfhfeel- light carbonation and surprisingly light body. The malts and hop oils stay with you for awhile.  Drinkability certainly has been established. I could drink this beer during a summer BBQ or next to the fire on a frigid winter night. Thank you to Stone and their gargoyle for this deliciousness.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,tronester,4.72,"Pours a slightly hazy orange with a small off-white head. Smells like a fresh grapefruit, amazingly rich. Taste is is the same up front with grapefruit, biscuity malt with a piney, floral finish. Very impressive bitterness levels that cling to your tongue. Mouthfeel is rich, carbonation levels medium and smooth. Fantastically drinkable, even with its aggressive flavors. The best double IPA I have had. Truly world class.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,itcomesnpints,4.77,"Glowing orange tint and a lively head with impressive retention. Another aromatic bomb from Stone. If you can manage to think past the in-your-face hoppy pine scent, you can uncover some grapefruit and peach. Taste=hops. And not just hops but IMMENSE hops, that somehow refrains from over-bitterness. My brain is screaming at the taste buds to man up, but the tongue does begin to sting a little from the hop fission reaction. I could drink a lot of these. In fact, I need to go buy another 6 right now. Welcome to Hop Heaven.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,hdofu,4.38,"Dark brownish orange if you let the light shine through it. Smell is like hop and honey. My Dad didn't like this one. This beer is very hoppy bitter with a bit of a sweet finish, if I could discern the sweet taste a bit more it would be perfect, overall thoug, it's still pretty tasty and I'm glad I have a case of it keeping my 120 ipa case company. Mouth feel was bubbly and oily. They called it a liquid poem to hops, yeah I agree, though it's not my favorite IPA, I like it though.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,therealmccoy3,3.6,"Not a bad brew. I would prefer the Stone IPA. I felt this was lacking in hops, but made up for it in the alcohol content.

Had tried this one before, but didn't remember it tasting quite this incredible!  Pours a cloudy copper orange with minimum head and the lace lingered as I drank.  Smelled very floral and somewhat sweet.  The mouthfeel of the beer is excellent. Very citrusy/piney tasting hops. Definitely on the hoppy side of IPA's even, but its the perfect balance of bitter hops, sweet citrus and alcohol. The carbonation is just right. The ABV is a tad under 8%, although you can't tell from drinking it as its simply one of the easiest and tastiest beers to drink of its strength.  One of my favorite IPA's for sure.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

A - Golden, slightly cloudy with a great head and long lasting lacing.  S - Slightly fruity hops, woody, sweet.  T - This beer was not as hoppy as expected. The malts and sweet alcohol dominate. Deep maltiness with hints of woodiness and honey, sweet floral aromatic, followed by slightly spicy, rindy citrus hops. The hops come out more in the finish, with a lingering bitterness on your tongue.  This is a delicious and highly drinkable beer, but not the powerhouse I expected. I enjoyed this IPA and was pleasantly surprised by how it kept some of the better characteristics of a double IPA in a toned down version.  Bottom line: Skip the shpiel on the back and enjoy this moderately hoppy and delicious IPA!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,chuckd123,4.35,"Oh, Ruination... If you like IPA's (and doubles), you've probably already had this stuff. What can I say that hasn't already been posted by everyone here -- Stone makes some of the best west-coast IPA's there are. Ruination is no joke -- read the label, it tells you where the name came from and it's right on. You are hit with one of the hoppiest, most grapefruity tastes in the world of IPAs as soon as this hits your palate. The aromas coming out of it are unreal. One of the more drinkable doubles out there as &lt;8%, and won't knock you over like a DFH 90min will. It's a heavy citrus-y smell and taste, and literally a double-IPA defined imho. Pour it into a snifter or goblet and just take in the aromas and enjoy it slowly at first, you will fall in love. As usual, great job Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,changeup45,4.7,Light orange color with a nice sticky head considering the abv. Carmel malts are followed by a strong rush of floral hops.

I don't think Stone ever disappoints.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,wingman14,4.18,"This one pours a orangish yellow with a white head that fades fast but leaves lacing. Smells sweet and hoppy, some malt characters. The flavor is very similar, lots of sweet flavor, good hop balance. Not as potent of a hop flavor as I thought, but still flavorful and full. A good balance, medium light body, great mouthfeel.

T: Starts as a clean pale ale, then with seconds the hops start to to come in with a citrus bitter bite that carries through that beer to finish and leaves a wonderful after taste  M: Great carbonation and great bite of the hop bitterness  D: I love this beer, but it will kill your taste for anything else that you will drink for the day.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Douglas14,4.55,"Pours a rich yellow-amber color with a nice white head. It's definitely not as dark as I thought it would be. The nose is absolutely incredible: heavy on the pine, very floral, and very perfume-like. Other notes come through as well...things like grass and lemon peel (strong). The taste is fucking ridiculous as well. Holy shit! It's wonderfully hoppy and bitter, but like everything Stone does, it is perfectly balanced and so damn smooth. One aspect of the beer doesn't overpower any other aspect, and that is what makes the Ruination so unbelievable. As for drinkability, it has one of the widest ranges of settings I can think of, and with a 7.7% abv, it's possible to drink more of this than other equally as rich tasting beers that can be in the 10%+ range. It could go well in just about any situation.  Awesome beer...I could drink this everyday.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,PatronWizard,4.32,"Bomber!! High degree of anticipation for this baby. I suspect it will be a great end to a long day.  Poured into my trusty Stone pint glass. Less head than expected, but I may have poured too gingerly out of nervousness in the presence of a killer. **Note: second pour produced the head I expected. Foggy orange caramel color. Seems clear at the bottom and hazy upwards.  I smell a fresh cut lawn. Or lemon. Or grapefruit. Ok, I don't friggin know but its something fresh cut. I love the scent.  Taste is Bang! Zoom!...To the moon Alice! This sumbitch will make you pucker. A happy yum-yum kind of pucker. Proudly proclaiming 100+ IBUs. Well 200 IBUs would be 100+. Wonderfully bitter. Even the burps smell good. And bitter. I take a sip and think the bitterness has subsided so I take another sip and realize oh hell no it hasn't.  Drinkability? I just don't know. I love the taste and keep sipping away relentlessly. I could probably sip on this all night. I wonder how many bombers I could take down. I would probably stand up, beat my chest, and boast about drinking six of them, then finish one and a half. No, two, because I'd sooner die than waste some of this shit.

Very citrusy, like a fresh cut lemon. Bright and unbelievably inviting.  Taste: Citrus dominates, like drinking a beer made with lemonade instead of water. Nice earthy hops aftertaste is reminiscent of resh lemon zest. Bitterness of 100+ IBUs is well hidden in this pleasant tasting IPA.  Mouthfeel: Slightly creamy, smooth and even.

You can smell the hops along with the toasted malts as well as some citrusy smells. For such a high IBU beer this is VERY smooth. The mixture of the citrusy hops flavor and the toasted malts flavor are beutifully balanced. The mouthfeel is nice a slight, I just ate grapefruit aftertaste but a VERY smooth beer for such a high IBU rating.

147,4083,KeefD,4.27,"Poured into a snifter, a hazy orange color with a 1/4 inch of foam and light lacing. An excellent color for DIPA, and something to be marveled. The smell is out of this world. Citrus fruits, orange and lemon at the front, followed by some grapefruit, a ton of piney resin, and a nice alcoholic note. The aroma of this bad boy is PERFECT. Taste is hops and more hops. Big, juicy, and extremely bitter. It's like chewing on a bitter orange peel followed by a grapefruit rind. Pine sap takes third place, followed by a short-lived malt sweetness that pops it's head in, and is quickly chopped off by the hops. Mouthfeel is slick, medium to full-bodied, and nice amount of carbonation. Very oily from the hops, but only adds to the hop flavor. It's blistering on the tongue. While the ABV is not outrageous, it can be felt in the nice warming in the mouth and throat. This, mixed with numbing affect of the hops, keeps drinkability low, but worth savoring.  I sometimes dislike it when a DIPA is all hops and no malt. This one definitely has that aura about, but that's what the brewers were going for. It's unbalanced for my personal taste, but it's a hop-head's wet-dream. I enjoyed it greatly, but prefer their standard IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The body is orange hued with a white head leaving good lacing.  Smells are citrus hop in the grapefruit variety with good maltiness as well.  The first sip allows the malt to say hi then the hops go to work creating a wave of flavor. Lots of grapefruit on the palate. Wow. A great beer. The mouthfeel is just about perfect as well with steady carbonation that isn't too much.  I can't wait to get this regularly in NC.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Strong grapefruit, citrus scents tell me that this is going to be one hell of a beer! Tastes exactly how it smells. Those hops really come at you full force, but not so much to overwhealm. Very nice malt backbone here as well, balances out the hops well, or as well as can be expected for an Imperial. Mouthfeel is just swimming in juicy, sticky, resiny hops, with nice sweet malts.

147,4083,PerzentRizen,4.27,"Stone has a great line of products that I am only starting to unmask.  The Ruination IPA says that it will destroy your palate, but I think that it is about perfect for an IPA and I have had many that did much more damage.  My Ruination was poured into a Trappist Ale Goblet and pours as expected and produced a great frothy head that slowly dissapated as I drank this wonderful beer.  The smell is that of pine resin and earthy malt.  The taste was just like the smell, but with a strong hop bite that would not let go. This must be the ruination they fortold. Despite the strong hop bite this beer begs you back sip after sip until you find yourself asking how it could evaporate so quickly.  My only disappointment is that it was gone soon, but luckily the buddy who's house I was at had another one and we devoured it next!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,GilGarp,4.32,"I remember having this one many years ago, before IPA was all the rage, before I really had an appreciation for hops and just drank ambers, browns, and reds. I hated it. I also hated the arrogant bastard and figured Stone just made beers to piss people off.  But now I'm a bit of a hop head so I thought it might be worth a second try.  Then I read the back - here's a small section from the lengthy prose: ""By the time you develop a taste for this beer, you may find that you are permanently ruined from being able to enjoy lesser brews. Good."" Well, the time has come.  Poured from a 12oz brown bottle into the stone ruination IPA pint glass that I've had for about 8 years. I always enjoy a beer in the proper vessel. ""I am very bitter. And I LIKE it!"" it states on the back.  Hazy golden yellow color with good head, retention, and lacing. It continues to maintain a thin film of bubbles on the top.  Aroma is rich in citrus fruity hops.  Taste is exceptionally hoppy and bitter... and I like it! It's not balanced, it's not subtle, and it's not appologetic.  Mouthfeel is good for an imperial IPA and drinkability is what it is at almost 8% ABV and over 100 IBUs.  I'm really glad I came back to this one.

147,4083,ShrLSU,4.08,A. Poured a light cloudy orange. This one had a thin white head that settled down to a thin halo. Nice lacing as the foam sticks to the glass quite well.  S. The scent is of piny hop and citrus taste. It has some definite bready/biscuit scent as well.  T. Fruity hops are at the front then the piney hops give a bitter taste. Some bready yeast taste as well as a slight sweet malt taste. I could use a little more malt balance.  M. This one was very creamy and a bit oily. Light carbonation and pretty easy going down.  D. This is a pretty good DIPA. Stone doesn't disappoint at all. It could use a little more balance overall but that's being nitpicky on a very solid beer. Wish I could get more of this in Louisiana.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ryrust5301,4.21,"Appearance - Looks like a good one. A very hazy orange gold color with a foamy clumpy white head. Generous amount of the head hangs around on top the rest of the way through.  Smell - Very citrusy, but a lot more malty than I expected. Hops are piney, yet very smooth and somewhat oily.  Taste & Mouthfeel - Crisp bite but not overly harsh. It's paired with just enough smoothness to give it balance in the mouth. A little bitter bite comes through in the end due to the hop bitterness. The malt creaminess really gives this beer it's identity. Stone did a great job blending it together with the hops. Citrus melon flavor with a gentle breadiness adds to the overall experience.  Drinkability - Stone really doesn't make a beer I don't like, and this was another winner from Cal. A wonderful job of not letting the hops kill the palate with the blend of sweet malts and bready notes. A great experience!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,oneeye,4.77,"Poured into a pint glass. A. Pours a copperish orange with lots of carbonation racing up to a thick soapy head. There is an orange glow that surrounds this beer that gives the head an orangish tint. Great sticky lacing at the pour and some left clinging after every drink.  S. The aroma of piney/citrusy hops in abundance upfront. You can detect the bitterness within the aroma. Citrusy as in grapefruit rind and piney as a fragrance of a ripe pine cone. The malts are present as well but not so much as a balance. Sugary bicuits.  T. Hops, bitter and resinous dominate the flavor. Bitter pine with a touch of citrus. Citrusy grapefruit with a touch of floral lemon. Caramel bicuity malts are of a light backbone. This beer finishes bitter and sweet.  M. The mouthfeel is creamy and oily. Bitter and warm with alcohol.  D. Drinkability is great if you are a hophead. Easy to drink and bursting with hops every drink.

147,4083,kinger,4.84,"Leave it to Stone to take it over the top and do is successfully. What a fabulous Imperial IPA. Aroma is hops of course, but there are hop aromas of pine, citrus, flowers, and fruit. I can hold the glass about 8"" from my nose and still detect the aroma, it makes the hair on my arm stand up. Pours a great gold hue with lots of thick white head that creates a decent amount of lacing. Great mouthfeel, surprisingly full and creamy. Flavor is jam packed with hops which wasn't a surprise. Fortunately you can also enjoy a good amount of malts. What is truly spectacular is that although it bites you right away the incredible amount of hops actually blend well and fade into a nice smoooth finish. I'm sure that I shouldn't be talking very close to anybody right now but this one works well. 100+ IBU's is crazy and for this beer to mesh and work out as great as it does deserves a round of applause.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Spicy on front of tongue at first, citrus-orange/lemon zest, then bitter finish.  D: Big, Bold and Bad! And as much as I like hoppy beers, this one was a little too much with no balance with the malts, probably as the brewer intended. It's straight up a hop-head's beer. I do think it would go well with a spicy meal though as the hops would complement such a dish well.  Also, about the name... forget tasting other beers after this one!

With strong hop smells, I always sense a smell of spearmint, which I definitely get with this one.  T: Talk about a beer that attacks your entire mouth. One sip gave a full on attack on my tongue, throat, and nostrils. Obviously very hoppy, but the hops flavors are definitely layered. I get a little leafy taste, a little astringency, and I can tell this is a little on the heavy alcohol side. The hop flavor in the aftertaste is nice, and it definitely leaves a taste of alcohol on the palate.  M: Good body, a little slick on the tongue.  D: This IPA punches you in the face.

Bursting with hops, pine, and citrus. Full-bodied and incredibly bold with some good spiciness. A surprisingly clean finish though. Looms in your mouth well afterward making you feel like you won't need to take a second sip for minutes as the taste just doesn't leave your tongue.  Gets better the more you drink it.

147,4083,ebit,4.4,"Appearance Hazy golden straw color with a frothy two finger cream colored head.  Aroma I can smell the grassy hops from 3 feet away, Upon further inspection the spice and floral notes come through. Very little detected in terms of malt. This is a hop bomb on the sinus.  Taste A faint wisp of sweet grain malt flows over the palate before being whisked away by the hops. The way the hops develop makes the beer a true must try to any hophead. Grassy hops similiar to the main body of the aroma come through first before progressing into pine and citrus with a healthy dose of spice that leads towards the bittering finish. Don't look for balance in this beer, but it is still quite interesting and tasty nonetheless.  Mouthfeel Medium mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation. It doesn't distract, but rather accentuates the hop bite. Perfect for this beer.  Drinkability/Overall Impression A very well crafted IPA. It is clean, refreshing, and boasts interesting development in the flavor profile despite being incredibly unbalanced to begin with. Alcohol content and the sheer obliteration of your taste buds lower the drinkability, but this is a beer to be savored and enjoyed over time.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,Ben4881,4.2,"Stone Ruination IPA Stone Brewing Company  Appearance: The Ruination is a transparent pale yellow straw color with a small white head. Bubbles erupt from the base of the glass. The head fades quickly and leaves decent lacing.  Smell: Not a very strong or overpowering odor, however, the smell is dominated by hops. A balanced combination of floral and citrus hop aromas is in the smell. Typically, I have found, one or the other dominates. This brew has an excellent balance.  Taste: An excellent amount of bitterness is consistent throughout the drinking experience. A sharp, piny hop flavored bitterness hits the palette upfront. Next, while the bitterness remains on the tongue, a splash of malt flavor and a slight suggestion of alcohol hit the roof of the mouth near the back of the throat. The malt and alcohol flavors are short-lived, leading to a dry, piny, bitter finish. The bitterness creeps back and tickles the tongue in the aftertaste. Excellent complexity and range of bitterness exist in this experience.  Mouthfeel: Ruination has a light to medium body with a healthy amount of carbonation, but not nearly as much as I expected from the appearance, which is a good thing.  Drinkability: The lighter body makes it drinkable and intense bitterness of this brew makes it a delicious sipper. With 7.7% ABV, Stone's creation is very drinkable, so long as one can handle the complex bitter hop flavors.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,MrMonkey,4.55,"Pours a slightly hazy golden amber with a thick and creamy two-finger off-white head that recedes slowly to a thin cap. Beautiful lacing and concentric rings left with each sip.  Smell is grapefruit, pineapple, peach, pine and caramel.  Taste begins with an assault of bitter grapefruit and oily, piny hops. Sweet caramel and doughy malts lead into some citrus fruit and pineapple flavors, trying to keep the bitterness in check. Finishes semi-dry with a slight alcohol warming. Bitterness is prevalent throughout, but never overbearing. Great hop flavor all the way through.  Medium-bodied, very smooth, slightly oily mouthfeel.  With a rather low ABV for the style, this is quite drinkable, as long as this is the only thing you want to drink all night.

147,4083,dancinwillie,3.68,"Pours a light orange color. Small, almost 1 finger white head that drops rapidly. Faint citrus hop aroma dominates, with a little floral character as well.  First sip is very good, lots of floral and grassy flavor, with some citrus from the hops too. There is a bready malt in there, but I really have to focus on it to taste it. The hops really overwhelm me, but that was the intention obviously. A little warming in my chest from the alcohol, but that's fine with me. I am not a hop head, and I thought this might be to hoppy for me, but I am pleasantly surprised to find I rather like it. Mouthfeel is a bit chewy, but I could have used a bit less carbonation myself, but other than that minor side note, this is a tasty beverage. I'm feeling hops on my tongue for about a minute after each sip. I would have to place drinkability in the medium range, because I wouldn't want to drink more than a couple of bottles before I lost all sense of taste. But if I was looking to drink just 1 bottle, or looking for a bottle to end the night, this would be an excellent choice for a nightcap.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Mouthfeel - Slightly oily, slightly under what I was hoping. Carbonation works well for it.  Drinkability - Goes down extremely well, especially for an IPA.

Color was surprisingly light and clear compared to Stone's flagship IPA, and a bit unusual for the style.  Very hoppy on the nose with mostly earthy notes of pine and peat and some deep floral, yet any hope of more fragrant floral or citrus evades me after the head dissipates. Interestingly, this is just the opposite of my usual experience.  Taste is initially sweet and buttery/diacetyl and rather rich on the finish, ever so slightly chewy on the malts. Feel is smooth and balanced yielding a nice drinkability. Very nice, yet I find this brew to be too sweet to make a habit of.

No need to stick the nose all the way in the glass before getting the first whiff...the aroma hits you as it's poured. Bitter citrus peel dominate, but all kinds of aromas come out...grapefruit, pepper, pine woods, hard candy. It's pungent and in your face.  The bitter citrus also dominates the palate, but there's a surprising sweetness; it's like having grapefruit with honey. It's smooth, refreshing, and very satisfying. Big hops but not harsh in the least.  Highly drinkable for packing such a hop punch. I think the relatively lower ABV for the style really makes this stand out.

Contains a citrisy aroma that also has floral hints mixed in.  The taste initially has a sharp flowery bitterness quality that contains numerous spicey notes in it. Some citris is present, but the floral hop bitterness overpowers the citris flavors.  Fluid mouthfeel overall in the body of the beer.

Taste: Citric grapefruit juices and packed with pine needles. Touch of peppermint, some floral hints as well. Citrus and melon fruitiness. Meek pale, lightly bready malts with a touch of caramel sweetness make an appearance when they can. Full, tongue-scalding bitterness.

Easily got 3 inches of head off a slow pour and that just exploded my visual senses.  Smell was of hops but oddly enough, not so hoppy compared to some other dIPA/iIPAs. Could smell notes of spruce somewhat along with that familiar standard IPA scent. Very appetizing.  Taste was great - could taste spruce and hops and a few other notes but it definitely lives up to its promise to ""ruin"" your palate... although it backfired a bit since you're still able to sense that this is a great brew.  Mouthfeel was quite exceptional, smooth, clean, crisp, and creamy all at once. Qualities that a dIPA shouldn't have, especially the creamy sensation, but quite honestly, I wish they all had this mouthfeel.  Drinkability is outstanding.

Taste is sweeter, smoother, and more citrusy then the nose, very nice, again, like fruitier, aromatic OG.  Mouthfeel is rich and slick, but not too heavy in the belly, with a tight, prickly carbonation.  Drinkability is good, this is a very fine DIPA, very much up my ally.

Smell: Big piney, cirusy, and floral hops attack the nose. Surprisingly there's also a caramelly maltiness in the aroma, as well as a buttery note.  Taste: Surprising malt up front, introduced by smooth caramel and breadiness. Then come the hops, drying everything up in the finish and leaving a tingling sensation throughout the mouth. These hops are huge, oily, and citric. However, the beer is at the same time supremely balanced so that the bitterness doesn't steal the show. Superb.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and smooth, spreading to every corner of the mouth, before leaving the mouth dry and tingly after swallowing, leaving you wanting more. I hardly ever say this, but... perfect.

T- With the exception of a few trace notes of light caramel malt, this beer is hardcore hops from start to finish.  M- Spot on, just rich enough without being heavy.  D- Dispite the in your face flavor its very drinkable.  If this beer doesn't scratch your hop itch, then nothing will!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,FSUmac,4.24,"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a pint glass....  Appearance: A deep amber with a 2 finger head. Lots of lacing.  Smell: Wow! I can smell the hops 3 feet away. Piney, citrus, peppery.  Taste: Fantastic bitterness to start which you expect and then a jolt of malt on the back of the tongue to help balance it out. A peppery grapefruit bitterness lingers in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Pretty thick mouthfeel, but I find it quite pleasant. Not overly carbonated, just right.  Drinkability: Maybe it is my love for IPAs and the like, but I love this beer. If you love hops, you need to give this a try. Be careful though, a 22 oz will leave you feeling quite nice! :D",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,gwood,4.5,"Served cellar temp at McG's...  Huge airy head from the beer engine that just absolutely coated my glass with thick sticky lacing from the first sip to the last...stunning.  Smells of oranges, grapefruit, pine, pineapple, and some floral notes as well - strong almost astringent feel in the nose when breathing it in. As if there weren't enough hops aromas and flavors in this beer, it's been spiced up with Columbus and Simcoe rounds of dry hopping. They both contribute a great deal of complexity to a big beer that is already heavy on the hops. There are blasts of citrus, pine, black pepper, and a slight grass hint in the finish. Same malt signatures as the bottled version but the real treat here is the cask presentation. The beer has smoothed out considerably, mouthfeel is soft and silky, this is just a treat to consume. So highly and dangerously drinkable after three pints I knew that things were going to go south if I kept going at that pace, but it was hard to stop. Just a wonderful presentation of what was already a great beer. Cheers to Stone for getting some of this up to us LA folks!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,kevinglin,4.37,"Wow! The label warns you to tread lightly, but you venture into the deep end without regard for your own safety!  Pours a somewhat hazy gold with a gorgeously creamy, slightly off-white head that hung on for the duration of this enjoyable brew. Huge hop nose - grapefruity citrus, floral and some spiciness. Flavor is tremendous - especially for hopheads. Aggressively bitter, but there is a malt profile that backs it up. Mouthfeel is creamy and full, but doesn't finish sweet or heavy.  Another great offering from Stone - I'll have it again for sure, but I don't think I could have too many of these super-flavorful beers in one evening. Definitely don't have it before you have a lighter offereing in the same sitting.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,pinotboy007,4,"Quality ale! Enjoyed from a Paulaner Weiss Bier glass. I'm no hop-head but this could convert me.  A - Nice brassy/copper pot look with an off white head that never really settles. Splendid lacing that consists of thick rings.  S - Caramel malt, pine, citrus/floral hops, lightly toasted oak and some yeast.  T - Grapefruit/citrus up front, with nice hop bitterness that doesn't overwhelm. It's there, but not with sharp elbows. Pine. The alcohol is there. Has a dry biscuit malt and resiny aftertaste that lingers.  M - Perfect carbonation in support of a semi-creamy -- yet still crisp -- ale that works on many levels. Very appealing.  D - Big time; all weather/year 'round. A summer or winter sipper.  Get a few.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,BeerBelcher,4.18,"I really enjoyed this beer which, as of last night, is now available here in Wisconsin. Aroma offered lots of nice grape-fruit character, whereas flavor was hoppy, offering a good amount of bitterness and abundant fruitiness...some apple and pineapple. Mouthfeel was quite dry but eminently smooth and enjoyable. Appearance was a bit light in color and with less head than I would've expected, but you don't taste with your eyes, so I'm willing to forgive that this beer is not terribly photogenic.  I would highly recommend this beer. I had this on-tap at the Sugar Maple in Bayview, WI.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,ASymon13,4.6,"It pours a pale orange with a solid fluffy white head that leaves some thick lacing as it recedes. This big beer has a nice big aroma. Lots of floral notes and some citrus in there. Definite Centennial hops. Gotta love'em. Some sweet malts come through behind them, giving the aroma the impression that this beer isn't quite the one-trick-pony it's reputed to be.  The hops are truly the center of attention on this beer, but it is not as gigantic and overpoweringly bitter as you would think. The floral notes continue to push through as the dominant hop flavor, but sweet and bready malts really balance it out and make it far easier to drink than some extremely unbalanced DIPA's. It finishes very very clean, possibly cleaner than any other DIPA I've had, giving it excellent drinkability. It has a medium to medium-full body, and lively carbonation.  It is definitely a great DIPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

A bit of citrus in there too.  Taste, this may be my favorite beer. I wasn't overpowered by the hops. Not overly bitter but you wont be calling for more hops, but you wont find too many, a perfect balance.  Mouthfeel, near perfection as well, nice and clean.

The creamy head dominates and takes root at the top of the glass and leaves it's reminance behind with each aromatic sip. It has more laces than my wife's knee high boots.

Oily, resinous, herbal. Ruination indeed. Understated malt stays out of the way (or is pummeled into submission). Alcohol taste is in there too, but also in the background. Good medium body.

This beer has a big foamy/bordering on creamy head that lingered nicely. Also this beer had an insane amount of lacing that reminded me of how much I enjoyed consuming the beer.  A little more spice than most IPA/DPA's and I really like the character this adds to the beer.  Excellent balance and nice Hops aroma and flavor.

147,4083,woemad,4.45,"22oz bottle purchased at Huckleberry's in Spokane for $5.99.  Poured a hazy, orange-copper color. Big, creamy off-white head with lots of lace.  The first thing that jumps out from the nose is a citrusy hop scent, almost like a glass of grapefruit juice. A piney smell hovers in the background, subordinate to the citrus smell but bigger than the sweet maltiness that is way in the back, just enough to provide a contrast.  The taste starts off with a hop whallop to the taste buds. Flavors of grapefruit and sharp spices vie for dominance. In the background are herbal, bitter flavors. There's a faint, caramel like sweetness way in the back, but it gets swept away by the wave of dryness that is the swallow.  Medium bodied, with a prickly, oily mouthfeel.  A very tasty, very bold DIPA. If you like big hop flavor, this is the beer for you. Ruination is a great name, as I'm seriously thinking pushing my dinner back an hour to let the smack my taste buds took fade a bit. Definitely worth the $6, and I'll buy this again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,number1bum,4.18,"Part of NEPA BC split #15. I can't believe it myself but I've actually never had Ruination before. I suck.  Pours is absolutely picture perfect. Perfectly clear amber color, big, dense and super creamy ivory head. Excellent retention and lots of stick.  Smell is full of fragrant hops, particularly pine and earthy notes. There is some citrus in there, too, along with a little caramel malt sweetness.  Taste doesn't explode with hop flavor on impact the way I expected it to. Some nice earthy and piney hop flavor, along with a bit of citrus, but it doesn't quite have the ""pop"" I thought it might. it's quite bitter, though, with a long lingering herbal bitterness in the finish especially. A bit of caramel malt sweetness provides some balance but it leans toward bitter rather than hop flavor or malt balance.  Mouthfeel is a hefty medium body but isn't quite as creamy as some DIPAs.  This is a very good DIPA but not an elite one. Still, a very fine beer indeed.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,CaptainIPA,4.45,"Served in a 22 oz., brown bottle adorned with a hopped-up gargoyle @ The Flying Saucer Draught Emporium in Cordova, TN.  Pours a hazy copper with a thin, pitted, eggshell-colored head.  Floral hop aroma with pungent promises of pine.  Impressively well-balanced: the perfect amalgam of buttery sweet malts and bracingly bitter hops. Prominent notes of citrus rind, grapefruit and pine.  Surprisingly sessionable considering this Imperial clocks in at 7.7% ABV and over 100 IBUs.  ""A liquid poem to the glory of the hop!""

147,4083,Spidey13,4.02,"Ruination looked a couple of different ways in my snifter. The first pour from the bomber appeared to be a hazy orange/gold color. The second pour was much more clear and more on the golden side. Both had a small white head that quickly faded away. The nose is almost all grapefruity hops with a hint of underlying alcohol.  The taste is almost all overwhelming bitterness, with some breadiness in the back of the throat and alcohol flavor. The mouthfeel is nice and full with a moderate amount of carbonation.  This beer is very drinkable for having such a strong flavor.  I figured out that, if you wait until the bitterness fades a bit after the swallow and then press your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you get the bitterness all over again.

Intense bitter sting upfront with out over doing it. Citrus n the back end as well as some maltiness to balance  Brew drinks very crisp and dry. Carbonation is crisp.

Once poured the beer is orange amber in color with a medium bodied full head.  Full hop assault on the nose with a sweet malt undercarriage. There is a piney citrus scent that comes at you as soon as you crack the bottle open.  Taste is superb. The bottle says its all about ""the poetry of the hops"" and I will have to agree. There are beautiful citrus flavors and gorgeous hop bitterness flanked by a sweet warm malt flavor. There are also slightly toasted pine nuts and a warmth that works with the bitterness.  I can't stop drinking this beer. Its mild and balanced enough to be an awesome session beer but also hoppy enough to satisfy any hop head out there. A perfect example of an Imperial IPA. Well done stone brewing. Oh yeah it was readily available at the whole foods in Tempe AZ at a very reasonable price. In sixers and 22oz bottles.

147,4083,dickroop,4.17,"Straw color brew and not perfectly clear. Wow, 2 whole fingers of pillowy, persistent head with thick lacing. The nose was richly hopped, emitting massive aroma of citrusy, piney hops w/ a faint backdrop of alcohol and small bready malt tones.  The taste was hop-heavy, but not as good as the smell. Alcohol was present, and it was sweet around the edges of bitter, but mostly bitter (100 IBUs, sez the bottle?!) I suppose I could imagine some nutty flavor tones, but to tell the truth, I was a little disappointed by the flavor. It's got a lot of the same elements as some much bigger beers, without the higher alcohol, and that is good.  Mouthfeel was a little oily, full bodied because of the complex balance of bitter and sweet. Also slightly cloying and biting.  This brew is definitely a sipper, full and satisfying. *One* of these gives a good buzz and sense of indulgence. Ruined? No, that would take 2 or 3, and I'm not going there.  Note that I bought these at something over $16 a six, together with taxes, they came out *mighty* expensive.

Hops Hops and more hops, mostly grapefruit with some piney smell to it. The malt starts off strong but then the hops make their presence known. The hops start off with a citrus taste then the grapefruit takes over. Their is a nice balance between the malt and the hops. Smooth tasting with moderate carbonation, unlike other stone beers their is no oily coating left on the tongue. Not a real bitter aftertaste, nice DIPA that is probably easier to drink than others so I would say I could have a couple of these.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,malcontent,4.3,"Brilliant, transparent orange body with spotty yet sticky lacing. Cream-colored head caps off a super-looking beer.  Mandarin orange, pine needles and hints of brown sugar represent the Stone knack for hops in a big way. Excellent job of balancing strong malt and hop aromas.  Actually not the citrus rush I was expecting. The malt is in the tradition of its British forbearer's with loads of solid malt sweetness to balance the ass-kicking but in-control hops.  Full mouthfeel with balanced carbonation and an impressive lack of oiliness for an IPA this big. It's strong, but it drinks so smoothly that a hophead would be delighted to stick with this all night.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Goliath,3.93,"Review #100  Pousr a clear amber color with a thin slightly yellowed head. Decent retention and a little lace.  Aroma is fairly strong. A nice hop profile presenting a bitter grassy/piney feel.  Taste is deliscious. A bitter piney/grassy hop taste dominates with a pils like malt characterstic on the finish. I was actually expecting it to be more potent. I'm slightly disappointed.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with an appropriate carbonation pop.  Drinkability is relatively low. Alcohol is moderate but manageable. Flavors are good for a hop head. However, the hop bitterness will wear on anyone with excess consumption which limits it's drinkability.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,JEdmund,4,"Appearance Surprisingly light in color--golden yellow/orange with a tiny head and low carbonation; 12 oz. bottle has a drink by date of Feb. 12, 2008, so it's a bit past its prime now; little to no lacing left (sign of aging?)  Smell Sharp pine plus some fruity notes; extremely inviting and appetizing, though a tad small for a DIPA; hints of sweet malt  Taste & Mouthfeel Hops from the nose carry through, trampling over my tongue, leaving a lasting bitterness. From front to back, it's full on hoppiness leaving a slight oily residue. The body is low for a DIPA and is somewhat disappointing. I always want a substantial portion of malt and this doesn't deliver that, but it does provide an unequal distribution of hops and still manage to be extremely drinkable.  Overall Super drinkable and flavorful, but I'm used to even bigger DIPAs (Hercules, Maharaja). If this were considered just an IPA, I'd rank it really high, but as it is, I'd say it's a tad small for its style. After realizing the drink by date was three months past, I'm certain this beer would have been even more impressive had it been fresh, so this review isn't completely fair.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Mit,4.25,Wow...this is one of those beers that I had read about on the net and for some reason never picked it up. I had previously tried the Stone Oaked Arrogant Bastard and quite liked it.  Delicious dark amber colour that seems to hint at the strength and complexity of this beer.  I could smell the hops as soon as I opened up the bottle. A sensation that only grew stronger as I emptied it into the glass. I was truly in awe of the of the hoppy power emanating from my pint glass...and a little scared that I was going to not like it.  The first taste was actually a little citrus like with the wave of hops crashing in after it. I found the bitterness lasted in the back of my throat and seemed to change to an almost earthy flavor. Unbelievably delicious.  You could really feel the weight and strength of this beer on the tongue. Nothing watery about this but it's not syrupy either. Very nice feel despite the higher ABV.  Well this beer was delicious and I could see downing a few of these with friends. I would be afraid if I drank too many at one sitting that I wouldn't appreciate this beer to it's fullest.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ibbjamin,4.39,"Paid $13.99 for an 6 pack from BevMo in Gilroy, CA. Poured into a pint glass.  Nice 1.5 inch white head that drops slowly. Nicely carbonated. Light yellowish orange copper color. Just a hint of cloudiness. Nice lacing that lasts.  I could smell the hops from a foot away during the pour. Doesn't seem overcomplex, just a strong quality hop aroma with citrus grapefruit undertones.  Upon hitting the mouth, this one doesn't taste much different than your standard IPA; bitter and citrus hops. It's not until after swallowing that a variety of hidden flavors come out to play - the sweeter malts balance the hops quite nicely. Tough for me to pinpoint all the flavors, but it is an excellent tasting beer. A mild bittersweet hoppy aftertaste leaves you wanting more. Perfectly carbonated. Easy to drink, very crisp on the mouth with hefty carbonation and a lighter body. A somewhat creamy finish.  Not the strongest, hoppiest DIPA I've tried, but one of my favorites.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Gtreid,4.04,"Thanks to Paul 68 for this tasty brew.  A: Poured a cloudy, golden amber with 1 1/2 fingers of cream colored head. Thin, sticky lacing, nice retention.  A: Great aroma of floral and citrus hops. Grapefruit and orange dominate the nose.  T: Above average for the style, again the hops dominate, with a nice, sharp bitter finish.  M: Medium body with very little carbonation. Slightly gummy.  D: This is a very nice DIPA. I would have liked to see this one with a little higher ABV . Most in this style are around 8-10%, but none the less a very fine beer. At 7.7 ABV very drinkable. Great beer for my first Stone experience.

Smell is fantastic pine and earth with a hint of malt/biscuit Taste is an earthy, grassy hop. Sharply bitter finish and aftertaste. Could use a bit more malt balance Mouthfeel is very nice. This is a smooth beer. There is good carbonation and substance, with an oily mouthfeel. This is an extremely bitter beer, so I think I am up for one or two.  Definitely set the bar a while back for Double IPAs. But this is not the best in class. Worth a try if you've not had it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,emerge077,4.03,"Glowing orange body, tight head with a creamy surface texture. Lace forms in sheets, and really looks amazing as it slowly dries into webby capillary shapes.  Grapefruit is the distinct aroma, delivered by a pungent load of hops.  Nice hint of sweetness melded into the heavy load of hop bitterness. Alternating pine and citric bitterness, juicy at first, then fairly dry in the aftertaste. Pine flavor wins out in the end, balanced by light malt flavors.  It's not so over the top that you can't take a big swig without stripping tooth enamel. It's actually pretty drinkable, but the alcohol can limit a session somewhat. Try mixing it up with their regular IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,yourefragile,4.23,"22 oz bottle poured into a Duvel tulip.  A: Very nice looking, pale golden amber color with a little cloudiness and some steady carbonation. Frothy white head that steadily dissipates to a solid film and thick ring of bubbles and some clumpy patches of bubbly lacing. S: Wow, I smell a punch of hops from this from across the table after pouring. Very piney and some citrus, big time hop aroma. Background of a malt body and some alcohol aromas. T: Body has very strong malt presence and sweetness balancing the strong punch of hops and their citrus and piney sweetness. However, in the finish the hops take over and dig into the tongue, almost to the point of being overbearing, but not quite. M: Smooth, medium body with a lot of carbonation and a devastating bite of hops in the finish. Makes you want to keep drinking it as the body is so smooth and hoppy and the dry aftertaste leaves you wanting more. D: This is a delicious, well balanced, bomb of an IPA. One of my favorite Stone beers and only thing holding this back is the overwhelming punch of the hops which is one of the best parts of this beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Big citrus flavor with some orange and mango and slight taste of blueberries and raspberries, hops compliment flavor expertly every step of the way fading into a hoppy finish with a slight bitter bite. Mouthfeel is impossibly smooth with the hops lasting through the back of the mouth and through the throat, but never uncomfortable. Drinkability is perfectly matched with the strength of this beer.

Taste is quite the same, a hop bomb thru and thru, citrus notes and pine resin overwhelming the palate. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy bodied, well carbonated, and it glides nicely across the palate. Drinkability is perfect. The abv is not overwhelming like some of the malt bombs that are out there. It is a near perfect example of the double ipa style.  With this beer, you only need two.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

T- Like I mentioned above very edgy. The hoppyness is very overwhelming. It has good flavors but this beer will defiantly deliver a kick to the crotch of your taste buds. There isn't enough malt to balance out the hop flavors.  M- My taste buds are still recovering from the overload.  D- I wouldn't recommend drinking too much of this in one night.

147,4083,Jedimaster1,4.4,"I must say, I was unimpressed by this brew. Maybe it was the hype or my own expectations, but I was not as impressed with this brew as others here.  A: A clear bronze. The head retains itself on the top of the glass and stays as you consume.  S: The smell of hops is definitely at the forefront. Nonetheless, there is a hint of citrus as well.  T: The taste was of a very hoppy IPA. The hops are not as overwhelming as the the bottle suggests (which is a good thing). Through the hops, a slight taste of malt can be found.  M: Good, refreshing mouth, leaving it dry.  D: It is a very drinkable beer. One could easily drink one or two.  Overall I was unimpressed by this brew, not because it tasted bad (to the contrary, it is a good brew), but because it tasted like an IPA -- and not of a DIPA. It was for me just a good IPA, but nothing too distinct from the rest of its class to set it apart. Still a good brew to have, just don't expect it to be the best.  EDIT: I had to rereview this brew. It is actually excellent! One of the Best DIPAs I have ever had. I will leave my original comments, but boy was I wrong. It is more refined and well balanced compared to my initial offerings. Maybe it was the batch or my lack of experience with good IPAs. Well whatever the case, it is much better than my original tasting.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The nose is filled with grapefruit and piney hops that are nicely blanced with malt balls and a touch of caramel. In the mouth this is medium-bodied and has a wonderfully smooth texture. This is extremely well-balanced and shows off its hoppy charachter. It all ends with a smooth but bitter finish.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Slight lacing on the glass.  Smell: The hops have a floral citrus smell and a little bit of bready, peppery yeast. Slightest hint of malt.  Taste: Incredible citrus note within the almost overpowering grassiness of the hops. Very little malt up front, becomes noticable after a couple of seconds. Finishes with a lot of pine to it.  Mouthfeel: Coats the mouth with a lovely hoppiness. Very appropriate for the style.  Drinkability: Be careful with this beast.  *Sampled this again after a year. The immediate grassiness goes away in the front, but is noticable in the back of the taste.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Offa,3.73,"I'm not the biggest fan of IPA, which is overall one of my least favourite styles but, ironically, I generally prefer double IPAs. This is a good one, although not something I would drink often. I think the extra alcohol and malt, along with the use of hop flavours rather than simple bitterness really is the key.  It's gold with a thick, lasting white head and good lacing. The aroma is extremely hoppy, but pleasantly so, being very floral and even soft and sweet, with some malty caramel quality underneath.  The taste is bitter and very hoppy in flavour. It's somewhat complex and interesting with a lot of flowery pine and citrus and has a good, fairly strong malt body, richness, with smooth sweetness to balance the hops. My biggest problem is that it feels, especially in the finishing bitterness, like it's drying my toungue with a thick towel, which is rather unpleasant. This is a rough, unnecessarily harsh hop element that I don't care for in the least and I cannot remotely understand why anyone would enjoy it.  It's somewhat interesting and flavourful, but for me not all that drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,steelscarab,4.79,"Poured fresh from my growler to the goblet.  Appearance: Pours a copper-hue with a nice inch of head that stuck around for a nice amount of time. It leaves nice lacing on the glass as well, but overall the appearance is nothing too special.  Smell: What this DIPA lacks in appearance, it fully gains back with its smell. Citrus hops goodness is unleashed upon the nose and dominates the smell, yet one can detect other subtleties. I smelt a bit of pine, malt, and even a bit of fruitiness. If you love hops, just the smell alone will make you drool for this ale.  Taste: Now this is truly a DIPA to be reckoned with. I first expected this ale to hit me in the face with its hops, but this is not the case and that's why I think it's so good. One tastes soft, bready malts that are perfectly suited for the high amount of hops of this ale. The hops are complex and strong, but not overwhelming. You can clearly taste the citrus, pine, and even a floral taste as well. You get a slight alcohol taste towards the end of the sip, but you barely notice it with the strong hop and smaller semi-roasted malt taste backing it all up. This is a very solid ale indeed.  Mouth: Good mouthfeel. It has a full bodied texture with just the right thickness you'd expect from the taste. Despite the thickness, it is very crisp and smooth as well. It ends with a bit of dryness that makes you anticipate the next sip with glee.  Drinkability: Very high drinkability, though one does need to exercise some caution with a DIPA like this. If you start out with this ale for a night of drinking, don't be surprised when all of your following ales taste like hop. Also, the smoothness of this ale conceals the higher alcohol content and its easy to drink a couple too many of this one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,crayphish,4.05,"A finely crafted DIPA. This brew pours a fairly dark amber with moderate initial head that dwindles down to a dense cap. The smell is mostly a citrus with some earthy floral notes. The citrus is indistinguishable, but not grapefruit. Some resiny pine finishes the palate off. Just an OK aroma, though the taste is a different story. Solid hop punch here. Very bitter. The hops have way more of a piney resin aspect here. The citrus aspects are gone. Just the slightest hint of any malt balancing. Mouthfeel is clean crisp and likened to a thermal nuclear hop implosion in ones mouth. Forget about moving on to a different beer, your done. Very enjoyable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,TravelingBeerMug,4.47,"I poured this into a large mug from the brown bomber bottle, and it had a wonderful dark amber color with a quickly dissipating off-white head, and natural translucence that looked just right. Left nice lacing behind after sips. This IPA has a strong, glorious hop scent that I rated as a ""5"" as it is one of the best I have smelled. Very flowery and earthy. The taste is definitely bitter but is balanced fairly well by the alcohol and general wholesomeness of the beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,csmiley,4.5,"A - Vessel of choice is a tulip glass for the Ruination. Color is medium gold with orange highlights. Head topped out at an inch and a half and was comprised of many different size off-white bubbles. Retention was just short of excellent and ended with an extensive network of bubbles that rounded out the lacing.  S - There is a nice citrus hop aroma that starts it all off with notes of orange and grapefruit dominating. After that starts to fade, some resin starts to show itself. Some earthy hop aromas are in the background but remain mild. Some malt starts to show up on the very end with hints of pale malt and honey. Smells like this one was designed to showcase the hop aromas that are possible.  T - Starts out with sticky hop flavors and starts killing the taste buds immediately. Once again the citrus sticks with orange and grapefruit with the possibility of some sweeter fruit sneaking in (think strawberry). Strong resin flavors quickly follow the citrus and mellow out to some grassy notes on the end. The base malt is present but never gets in the way of this beers true intention. Malt flavors are very mild and only detectable as pale malt and honey.  M - Full bodied with great carbonation. Finish is fairly bitter but not so much that it detracts from the overall experience.  D - Drinkibility is very good. Everything seems in good balance and makes for a great beer. The amount of alcohol is just low enough to put a couple of these down in one sitting. Highly recommeded and hop-tastic.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Mouthfeel: medium/full body with a mild carbonation level.  Drinkability: quite drinkable, especially for the style. This bitterness is on the high end, but there's just enough malt backbone to make you want more of this beer. Excellent take on the style",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S: A lot of the typical hoppy aromas, such as, strong citrus, more on the orange side, blended with some pine as well. Very hoppy aroma, with some sweet malts, but the hops own this beer.  T: Great citrus up front. The high alpha hops really shine in this beer. Some minor malty characteristics are present, but this literally tastes like I just put a few ounces of fresh hops in my mouth.  M: Very smooth for a DIPA and for how hoppy it is. A little dry in the finish. Not too heavy for a DIPA.  D: I would have to say that this is for Hopheads only.

147,4083,bluemoonswoon,4.7,"22oz bomber poured into a tulip glass, no freshness date but a cool silk screened bottle nonetheless.  Also..big thanks to JoeyBeerBelly for this one.  A: Pours a crystal clear golden orange with a creamy pure white head, pretty but plain looking. The head of an inch and a half bubbles away into a ring in about five minutes but does leave some thick sheets of lacing down the glass, so it saves some points there.  S: Interesting to come across this beer after experiencing so many larger hop crazy beers. The aroma is citrus, citrus, citrus floral hop bouquet but covered by a solid layer of piny grassy resinyness, all of these are quiet though, that is to say while these aromas are present they do not hit you over the head  T/MF: While the aroma might be subtler than most other DIPAs the taste and mouthfeel are unlike anything I've ever come across . I finally understand what people mean by teeth pulling, tongue ripping bitterness because this beer grabs hold and does not let go. Thick sheets of piny hop resin weld themselves to my tongue and the longer they stay there the floral citrus flavors begin to become more noticeable with a slight nuttiness and , but barely. This one is all about the pine and it really hammers that point home. The mouthfeel is super sticky and it doesn't even matter that the carbonation is low, this beer just hammers and hammers away with flavor. The finish lasts for days and sticks everywhere and is when some of the grapefruit and other citrus flavors show their heads.  D: The bitterness on this beer is just about the most intense thing I've ever experienced but I really don't think it effected my drinking experience. All I wanted was to keep drinking this beer. Excellent, excellent example of the style, hops hops and more hops and really thats what this style is all about. The ABV being relatively low for a DIPA makes this one exceptionally drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Smells of wet apricot-like hops with a touch of pine. Nice malty sweetness hidden in the nose too. Really enjoyable mouthfeel, big but not too viscous, smooth without being oily. Tight tingling sensation from the hops on the tongue. Hops dominate the palate (no shit, really?). Crisp and zesty, apricot flavors have transformed more to an intimidating pine over grapefruit sensation. A flash of malty sweetness right at the end. Finish is enjoyable and induces salivation. A really solid DIPA. Highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ElGrecoVerde,4.12,"This is the middle linebacker of beers. Your taste buds' defenses are no match.  The pour was surprisingly clear and pale. There was a little cloudiness, but it mostly sat their patiently waiting to wreak havoc on your mouth.  The smell of a well made DIPA is impressive to say the least. If they made incense of this stuff, I'd load up on them. Flowery and herbal aromas fly out with a bit of citrus as well. Don't be fooled by the flowery smell. The evil spirits know how to disguise themselves.  This is one aggressively flavored beer. Leafy, herbal hops pounce on your mouth as soon as the first sip hits your tongue. Your brain starts thinking ""overload"" just as a bready, almost cake-like flavor comes in to smooth it out. The evil spirits pass by, leaving behind a faint citrus peel flavor as a reminder that they now own your mouth.  Drinking such an aggressive beer would not be possible without proper feel. It's insanely smooth and creamy... absolutely perfect in that aspect.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The nose was very floral and VERY citrusy. Good Lord. Taste was very well balanced. While it was quite hoppy, it was very well balanced with the malt. The taste wasn't overly bitter either, which was a pleasant surprise. Don't know how much of this I could drink.

Lacing was chunky and all over the place.  S - Let me see... HOPS! A bounty of floral and citrus hops were everywhere. I expected this and was reassured of my expectations!!  T - WOW! What a great beer. I couldn't imagine an IPA needing more of a BJ than this one. I absolutely love this beer. However I was surprised on how well balanced it was. Hops abound with a nice malt companion that made it very enjoyable.  M - Medium bodied nicely carbonated. Finished semi dry but very refreshing.  D - If you like hops this one is a three-course meal.

The taste...well i can say that there is a very hoppy taste, almost as hoppy as an iperial ale. The aftertaste is very bitter. On a second sip, it definetly hits my palatte better.

Great nose is bursting with hops; sweet floral, fresh citrus, and resinous pine. Delish.  A solid medium body and oily smoothness accompany a very nice amount of creamy carbonation. The flavor is solidly bitter, while remaining far from overpowering. Orangey citrus rinds along with earthy, grassy, and piney hops all in good balance.  I'd call this a split between an IPA and a double. Either way, it is very good and I am wishing I could get my hands on it more often.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The taste is an explosion of hop bitterness that seemingly kicks you square in the mouth, one of the most mouth puckering experiences I have had with beer. The taste is all grapefruit. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and delightfully smooth and creamy. Overall, this is without question one of the finest DIPAs I have ever tried, and could be one of the hoppiest beers that has ever touched my lips. If you don't like hops, stay far away.

It poured a bright copper with only a small head. It smells strongly of hops hops hops! The mouthfeel is carbonated and very bitter--to the point almost I can barely hold it in my mouth for too long. The taste is bitter but less so than I would have imagined from the mouthfeel. I'm left with a strong, hoppy aftertaste that finished with a bit of alcohol.

A- Light copper, thick hop-sticky head with surprisingly little retention and moderate lacing. Color is a pretty standard IPA shade.  S- I understand their tale of ""ruination"", I just think there is a big difference between constructing a good beer full to the brim of intense hops and just throwing high alpha hops in a brew kettle. The real ruination, to me, is in the execution of this ale. Sweet, floral, with undertones of bitter grapefruit, all kind of lost on one another, stepping on the others' toes. It all gets mashed up in the nose; unbalanced.  T- I think Stone is capable of making great beer, but this is a failed attempt. Over-powering bitterness to the point of unpleasantry. Astringent, tart and citric...like sipping a solvent. Definitely has the ruining effect on the palate, which isn't necessarily a good thing. Hops are unbalanced and ward away any sign of malts or yeast. A simple retooling could improve this clumsy ale.  M- Again, astringent, tart, bitter, dry...ruins the palate in irony.  D- Not recommended. Very many imperials that are better constructed.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Pencible,3.58,"I finally tried this after having it on my to-drink list for quite some time. It poured a light copper color with a little bit of head, and it had a sweet lemon and hops scent. The flavor was much the same, dominated by a very lemony flavor and a bitter aftertaste. There was no malt or yeast flavor to balance it out, that I could detect anyway, and the texture was fairly thin and watery.

The smell- piney, citrusy, flowery, all the best characteristics of Stone IPA but jacked up to the nines. This beer did not overpower me and paired great with my pizza pie. Excellent head retention, glass lacing, a pretty honied color to the pour. the taste is out of this world complex, long lingering hops, grapefruit and pine- but soo so balanced and satisfiying.

S: Typical pine citrus hop mix, very sweet hop smell.  T:Whew...! Great hop/malt exchange. Hops are, as expected, very prevalent. Heavy pine notes with citrus fruit coming in second, bubble gum in there, little bit of caramel.  M: Great medium/heavy body. A bit chewey. Carbonation comes into play and the alcohol leaves a slight sting at the back end.  D:In the deluge of Imperials I've been drinking this season (90 minute, NuggetNectar), I think this is the most drinkable of them.  I'm a fan. Overall, I find this offering from Stone superior to their regular IPA in terms of complexity and balance. Just a well brewed beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,corey0212,4.82,"I've been calling this my favorite beer for a while now...figure it's time I threw my review into the mix. I can't say enough about this beer. Pours a bright golden/honey color...foamy white head with sticky lacing. Smells glorious!! Bright, citrus, piney/hoppy goodness. Wonderful bitterness....aftertaste stays with you for a looong time. So damn good. I really credit this beer with opening my eyes to how exciting the world of craft beer can be.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ckeegan04,4.42,Bottle into pilsner glass.  A - Somewhat cloudy orange/golden color. Nice thick head that stayed and lacing all the way down.  S - Strong citrusy hop aroma. Picked up a little hint of alcohol as well.  T - Lives up to the name. The blast of cirtusy hops with a hint of spice as well. The malts do a surprising job of balancing the intense hop taste.  M/D - Incredibly smooth beer. Excellent carbonation. The taste does smash the palate so it wont do you much good to sample some other right after this one. I could certainly make a night out of the beer.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Tumpster,5,"Far and away my favorite DIPA of em all, it holds true to it's word though, in ruins you're palate but in a good way. Tast is very hoppy and very bitter but it's DIPA what really did you expect? ;-) Mouthfeel is very full feeling with the alcohol not being too overpowering to you but I could see being very well off after a few of these. My tip is to open this up and pour into a glass and take a smell right off the bat. That, my friends, is a dang good IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,srroos,4.19,"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours a nearly clear orange with two fingers of fluffy head. Head settles down to a cap and covers the glass in lacing. Smell is hoppy, but nothing that indicates how incredibly bitter this beer is. Tastes so incredibly hoppy and bitter it is unbelievable! Medium bodied, but so bitter it seems more full bodied. Relatively drinkable for the higher ABV and super bitterness.  A total Imperial IPA standby. Hopefully Stone doesn't change anything with the hop shortage...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,hckyfn9999,4.77,"Pours a golden orange with an off-white head. Lots of sticky lace. Aroma is of pure hops; sharp citrusy hops. Taste is full of hops as well. Strong citrus and pine flavors, with a little bit of sweet malt hidden in the back. Bitterness lingers on the palate. Mouthfeel is great, medium full, smoooth, well carbonated. This bomber is going down pretty easy. Nearly 8% ABV is pretty unnoticeable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,kingjames1,4.37,"Pours a (very) hazy nectarine, with a small head, but consistent lacing throughout. Quality. Smell is incredible: clear hops - citrus, pine resin, and speariment gum? But also detect a thick molasses underneath - caramel and sticky sweet. The taste is intense. At first, I am underwhelmed. I've heard a lot about this one, and expected a punch to the teeth. This one hits late. The aftertaste is nearly as intense as the initial sip - leaving the back of tongue tingling with hop-bitterness. Lemony, minty (wassup with that?), pine resin, with just a hint of a sweet malt foundation beneath - a vain attempt to make its presence known (yet somehow manages to provide some structure for this hop-bomb). The aftertaste is like sucking on a grapefruit. Feels like my eyes are ready to water.  This one is fun to drink.  Fairly drinkable, for the style, though a bit intense on the bitterness side - even for a hophead like me. Perfect carbonation. A +",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,pokesbeerdude,4.35,"Picked up a 22oz bomber in Vegas, I wish we could get Stone's stuff in Wyoming.  A: Poured a beautiful copper color, thick white head that stuck around throughout the beer. The beer was very bubbly and crystal clear. Pretty beautiful beer.  S: Citrusy hops, piney hops, hops, hops, and some bitterness. Interesting malt sweetness as it warms.  T: Bitter hits first and foremost, almost like eating a grapefruit peal, hops are everywhere, they burn the tongue, this is an extremely tasty beer. Tastes almost like chewing on straight hops. The malt sweetness is there but very hidden until it warms up. As the beer warms it becomes very balanced. There is a hint of alcohol as well, but it is very in balance. I really can't say enough about this.  M: Fairly thick but very well carbonated, pretty smooth. It warms the mouth and warms deep down inside. Probably from the alcohol and the hops. I figured it be a little thicker though.  D: This is definitely a hop head beer, it gets to be a little much to handle by the end of the beer. So I could have one of these every once in a while, but it'd be when really craving some hops. One is definitely good for a night. Definitely a good beer though. I really enjoyed it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S: All out grapefruit and pine hops... lovely.. rich, yet delicate... you get some grain (kind of like a butter bagel)  T: Not quite as complex as the nose suggests, but throughly balanced and delicious...  M: Solid medium body. Smooth and crisp finish. Slightly bitter at the end.  D: A tremendously accessible dIPA that doesn't lose its hop edge.. nice job guys!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,AKBelgianBeast,4.37,"A go to when I feel hoppy  Pours a clear orangey yellow with good white head that lingers. Nose is just balls out citrus hop flowers with ever so slight spice. The taste follows with hoptastic flavors and great bitterness. This is called ruination for a reason. My tastebuds are crying (joyfully, it hurts so good) hop bitterness lingers on the finish. Unmistakeable west coast Super IPA. Mouthfeel is pretty much flawless for the style, and drinkability is pretty darn good. Defenitely a good go to IPA, and readily accesible.

T,M- The smell totally hide the huge hop flavor in this beer. Stromg hops taste with a sweet malt finish. Med Body, med carb.  D- Dangerously drinkable, this one will sneak up on ya. A good pick for the serious Hop Head!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Matty1918,4.65,"Poured a creamy 3 finger head that left lots of lacing. Color was a tad cloudy with a golden homey color.  Aroma was very fruity..almost of pineapple, a mild spice and citrus aroma too.  WOW...that first taste is HOPS...a tad bitter, spicey with a light citrus taste. Very complex tasting but not overpowering. I'm feeling the alcohol warm my throat and belly as it goes down.  This is going to linger on your tastebuds for a while.  Very drinkable....  Had another one for Easter Weekend....This just gets better and better each time you drink it. My initial review was the aroma was fruity almost pineapple like...well it's sweet but the more I take in the aroma it smells more and more like sweet grapefruit. This is truly an EXCEPTIONAL beer...I want MORE",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,RichardWalter,3.85,"Great etched bottle certainly impressive. Pours nicely. Small fizzy head that lasts on the inside of the glass. Yellow (light) color. Light floral aroma.

147,4083,SargeC,3.95,"Appearance: Hazy, orange-gold brew with a rustic golden-white head  Smell: Intense hop aroma, hints of butter.  Taste: Good hop bite. Citrus and pine flavors mix with an earthy malt flavor that lingers beneath it.  Mouthfeel: Medium body. Buttery smooth with a dry finish.  Drinkablity: Excellent, bold IPA. Cranks their standard IPA up a notch.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,fitzy84,4.17,"The drink settled with a dark, murky gold color with a medium head, which was amber-white in appearance. The aroma was incredibly sweet, with a mixture of hops, wheats, caramel and even spice. It was wicked sweet and sour for an IPA, giving it a great taste. The carbonation allowed it to be nice and crisp, but with the taste the drink has, this mouthfeel makes it odd with those flavors. Overall, a powerful, incredible IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Med,4.15,"A - Slightly cloudy dark gold with a quickly fading white head and medium lacing. This beer just looks inviting.  S - heavy hops with pine and some citrus.  T - Wow. This thing is bitter. And that's a very good thing. Tons of hops here with an interesting hint of grapefruit at the finish. That having been said, the malts aren't entirely overpowered and contribute a balance throughout the experience.  M - Medium bodied with a slightly watery feel likely due to the soft carbonation. A little more carbonation would go nicely.  D - I could drink this as an everyday beer. In fact I often do!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ZimZamZoom,4.12,"Nice light copper colored ale. Head was light tan and pretty thick, although it faded rather fast.  Aroma? Hops...right off the vine. I mean, pick them, rub them between your hands and sniff! I'm impressed that they can get this aroma into the beer. Seems almost magic to me.  Taste is more of the same. Not a well balanced DIPA, but this is not hop water either. the beer has body, albeit not a big malt backbone. Hops are big and citrusy, fresh and tasty.  Nice body and drinkable for sure. Recommended if you like hops!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,dmamiano,4.29,"Poured a nice hazy copper color..was really expecting ""hazyness"" because of the expected assault of the hops. Nice big head with sweet lacing. Aroma was BIG. Hops to the max with a sweet yet mild malt backing. Taste was great...hops upon hops...sweet in the back. Nicely balanced, but the hops take precedence for sure.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,barronkr,4.44,"Pours from a 22 oz. bottle.  The appearance is a clear amber with a respectable head.  The smell is amazing. I smell TONS of fruity hops in the nose, a hint of grapefruit and a touch of honey. On a second whiff, I smell fruit cockail: this is not meant to be derrogatory, but that is seriously the smell I get, and reflects the fruity character of the hops.  The first taste is very good. I was expecting a deluge of hops, as indicated by the name, but really I just got a mouthfull of deeply complex hop flavor. I catch some wisps of flavor I noticed in the nose, but they are added to a clean, unique hop flavor that is both somewhat fruity and and a tad spicy without being acerbic. The bitterness builds, but as it does, the malt becomes more evident: a clear, clean maltiness, a tad sweet, but not syrupy or cloying. As it finishes, again, a clean dryness that does not overdo it.  The beer warms nicely, allowing the flavors to drop back and the hop bitterness to build. As stated on the bottle, I don't think my palate could discriminately taste another beer right now.  The mouthfeel and drinkability are good for this beer, considering it is a DIPA -- no biting, acerbic hop character that can really detract from a hop bomb.  Overall, an excellent, very complex hoppy beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,pacothrash,4.57,Poured from a 12oz bottle with drink by 3/3/08. Amber orange color with little to no head but nice carbination. Very nice floral to grapefruit smell on every whiff. Nice sweet hoppy taste with grapefruit to pine and a nice hoppy bitter taste following the sweetness. Very nice DIPA. I could have 2-3 of these at one sitting but would prefer to savor every sip. In the same league with Hopslam.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BlaiseDemon,4.45,"Wow! What a great IPA. The bottle says it best, but here are my thoughts: A. Beautiful golden yellow with just a hint of murkiness; medium head with good lacing all the way down the pilsner glass. S. Grapefruit, hoppy, lively, with a sunny hint of tanginess. T. Refreshingly pure IPA with a little less than the expected hoppy bitterness associated with other IPAs; ruby red grapefruit, lovely hops, with just that hint of malt to sweeten the edge. M. Was pure IPA bliss, medium carbonation, with the hops and bitterness that feels just right D. I could down a few of these easily. It was one of the best IPAs I have had in some time and the balance of hops and malt and citrus and color made for perfect drinkability.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,alysmith4,3.74,"Wow! This beer is bitter! Very fresh and flavorful.. just what you would expect a Double IPA to be. It could be a tad hoppier and a tad less bitter for me, but that is just my taste.  The color was good. Nice and orange, with a good amount of carbonation. The smell was good as well.. a lot fruitier than I would have expected, with a nice earthy tone.  The taste was knock-your-socks-off bitter. For me, the bitterness (100 IBU's) was too much, and it overwhelmed any of the other flavors. As it warmed however, the bitterness mellowed and the hops came through. This is one that I would recommend, but I would suggest having it on the warmer side.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Kegatron,4.26,"12oz bottle into a Stone IPA Flute.  Pours a clear gold with 2 fingers of off-white poofy head. Wow, there is still a ton of release even several minutes after the pour. Even when it shrinks down some, there is still at least a 1/2 finger of retention left that leaves just massive hop lacing all over the glass. The aroma is a volatile hoppy mix of pine, floral notes, citrus, spice, thick malt sweetness, and alcohol.  The taste is more of the same, with a sticky resinous hoppiness that is nicely balanced by a beefy backbone of citrus and spicey malt character. The bitterness just lingers on the palette and mixes with malt sweetness and heat to give it a slightly medicinal feel that just coats the mouth and sticks to the tongue. The mouthfeel is thick and heavy with a syrupy feel from all the heavy malts and alcohol.  Wow, this definitely one brawny beer that leaves it all out on the table. Heavy hops, heavy malts, and heavy heat? Check! Check! and Check! Even wiht all those big flavors and feel, I still find this bruiser of a DIPA to be quite drinkable. It may lack the magic and panache of some other West Coast Hop Bombs, but this palatte wrecker from Stone can more than hold its own.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,rye726,4.53,Nice golden brown color with a tan head. Good bubbling and lace left on the glass.  Lots of nice aromas in this IPA. Citrus and floral hops with a complex blend of fruits. Deep with malts sweet alcohol tones.  A base of creamy malts topped by a well rounded hop profile. An earthy fruitiness challenged by a buttery bitterness.  Thick and silky with a crispy carbonation. A classic example of the style. A great Olde English style IPA. Well done once again stone.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ricchezza,4.58,"Very cloudy. Pours a thick head. Retains very well. Very hoppy aroma, as to be expected. The taste also has a lot of the hop bitterness I was expecting. Hop characteristics reminiscent of celery and difinately citrus.  All around this is a great beer that any hop-head would surely love and appreciate.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,iconoklaztor,4.05,"This brew pours a massive, white head that never wants to leave! The Ruination brew creates a head that adheres to the glass and remains till the very last drop. The appearance is probably the worst thing about the beer. It doesn't stand out to me in any way. The smell, however, is fantastic. It's as you would expect...HOPPY! The taste is an assault on the taste buds and as the bottle states kicks the ass of other tastes in the mouth.  Overall, this beer is truly an assault on the taste buds. Full of flavor and complexity. This beer is, for a lack of words, kick ass!  Cheers",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,bassmantin,4.59,"Pours a fairly transparent orage with a large clingy white head.  Smells of sweet bitterness. This is a great beer. The taste is excellent, very well-balance despite the intense hoppiness. Great example of an IPA. Excellent aftertaste.  I highly recommend this beer. One of the best IPAs out there.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Proteus93,4.2,"A: An excellent pour, with a rich foamy, high-retention head. Gorgeous, bubbly amber.  S: A bit of a hop medley in the aroma... scents or herbs, grapefruit & orangepeel citrus, and pine along with a touch of a floral sweetness behind it all.  T/M/D: Oily hops, and very little on the front of the tongue... it's not until this has settled in that the assault starts. Again, a bit of a medley, with citrus peel and pine blending in there. It all goes down quite smooth in the finish. All around, though, I find that I may prefer Bell's Hopslam on the flavour front in the style. I would still certainly go for another of these, though.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Contra,4.32,"Another fantastic beer from Stone, and one of their most well known. Bitter beyond belief, which will probably either turn you off or get your mouth watering. There is a peppery-spice to this beer as well. Many of the typical fruity notes are present, although perhaps to a lesser extent than some of the other Double IPAs. Aroma is fantastic, a sweet mix of aromatic hops and malt. Appearance is nothing out of the ordinary, but it's what you would except from an I.P.A.  Overall, a great take on what has become a huge style - the American Double I.P.A.. My favorite out of all the Double I.P.A.s is Weyerbacher's Double Simcoe, but Ruination is excellent as well. Might come down to whether you prefer a thick, silky body (Double Simcoe), or a lighter, smoother body (Ruination). Calling this a lighter body might be a bit misleading, of course.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,boogles,4.97,"I have not tried this in a while, and had a cold last time I tried it (so I couldn't smell it). This beer has me in mind. It's everything I like about beer.  I won't bother talking about the color, lacing, or anything else. This, like all Stone brews, is about perfection. Complex, but simple, and amazingly balanced. Unlike the Stone giants, this one is just right, the baby bear of IPAs. The hops are strong, but without the untasteable blast of bitterness that overpowers all else. And the nose--the nose is out of this world. It's citrus without the sickly sweetness, pine without the sap. It ends up being very floral and fruit punch, papaya, pineapple, passionfruit, blackcurrant.  My new favorite, I think. Time for a serious favorite-off between Ruination, Founder's Red, Hop Rod Rye, and Hop Slam. If I live through that, maybe I'll invite the RIS crowd. But in terms of where my present taste resides, this is it. Stone rules!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Raymond69,4.25,"Pours a slightly cloudy blond. Decent head , some lacing.  Smell is hoppy , citrusy and floral.  The hops in this beer seem to overwhelm any maltiness or sweetness.

This beer a sipper that I''ll enjoy one at a time.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ojclark,4.42,"Floral, slightly citric hop aroma that lasted for a couple of minutes after pouring. Deep golden color with a creamy head that remained for a while after pouring and never completely dissipated. Lots of lace on the sides of the glass. Serious hop flavor and bitterness. As the beer warmed up above 50 degrees, detected some alcohol bite that became a little harsh around 52 degrees. Beer was much better balanced when a little cooler (~48 deg). Detected subtle crystal malt flavor and aroma as well. Very carbonated which caused it to clear the palate very quickly, making way for a nicely bitter and hoppy aftertase. Overall, an excellent beer: big, hoppy, complex and even though hops dominated, pretty well balanced for a double IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,chinabeergeek,4.35,"12oz single bottle  what a difference a few months makes! now that i'm used to hoppy brews, this thing has now grown on me.  color is clear, but lighter amber than last time i remember. lots of fluffy head that fades to a thin layer and a fluffy ring, leaving similarly textured lacing.  yes, a piney floral aroma, but for the second time ever, i am getting tropical fruit notes similar to passion fruit. the only other brew to have done that for me is port brewing's hop-15. whiff of malt .  as for flavor, i think i can now truly appreciate the beer, seeing as i'm now able to also see through the powerful hop kick and extract the toasty malt out on my palate. that said, the showcase is the hops - piney, with tropical fruit notes and an earthy, herbal character that seems to smooth things out despite the powerful bitterness.  still a bit thinner than i'd like, but overall smooth, with resinous feel that coats the tongue, and a carbonation that keeps things fresh.  again, wow - what a difference a few months makes! now worth every penny, imno (in my newfound opinion)  drinkability is pretty high for me now, but last year this thing nearly knocked me out with its hop punch. novices beware!  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  OLD REVIEW 8/16/07: a-4.0 s-3.5 t-3.5 m-3.5 d-3.5  22oz bottle poured into pub glass  nice amber color. my head retention wasn't all that great, but better than average.  aroma is very piney and floral, as i expected.  as for taste, i suppose i'm just not attenuated to being a true ""hophead"" - at least not just yet. the hops just stood out way too much for me compared to the malt and other flavors.  nevertheless, i think i can appreciate what this beer is trying to do, and can certainly see why hop lovers rave about it. anyway, even if i did have a better affinity to it, i think it would probably just be too expensive to be a regular of mine.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Gehrig,4.53,"I'm very thankful that I finally tried Ruination IPA, a wonderful and potent beer that pleases all senses. It starts by tantilizing the eye, layout out three full fingers of durable white froth, all nestled above a surprisingly clear orange-amber body--incredible. The nose is excellent, heavily hopped but somewhat offset by fruit and malt creeping in for attention.  It's a magnificent beer on the taste buds, with hops unsurprisingly prevailing but not without orange peel and lemon protruding. I'm definitely impressed. A little more fruit to balance out the hops would be ideal, but it's neither overly hopped nor without fruit. To a degree, it's splitting hairs, for this is a gem. The texture is heavily hopped without becoming gritty, and is actually quite smooth. Highly drinkable, this is one DIPA not to pass up. It's truly excellent, big and brawny without being overbearing, certainly one of the best I've tried in some time.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,elmore,4.22,"Poured from a 1pint 6oz bottle into a tulip glass. Bottle claims 7.7 ABV and 100 IBU. A brisk pour gave it a tight, white, 2 finger head with decent retention. Some lace left on the side of the glass. Pale golden color - lighter than most IPA's. A bit hazy as this is an unfiltered ale.  Floral hops dominate the nose. Malts not very apparent.  The taste is mostly hops. The hops are citrusy up front and develop into a piney taste in the mid palate and finishes with a dry sharply bitter aftertaste. The bitterness lingers for awhile. There is some biscuity malt, but to me the taste is nearly all hops. Alochol is not apparent in the taste or feel.  Clean, light and refreshing. Somewhat thin and watery. Carbonation is moderate. Very drinkable for the alcohol content.  A good, and unique IPA. I really like the wide variety of IPA's stone produces. I recently had the Stones 11th aniversery ale, which was an IPA with more of a dark, carmel-like malt. I think this is nearly the polar opposite as the malts are very light, which allows the hops to dominate.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Flowers, perfume, pine, earthy, grassy citric woody flavors with a dry finish.  m: Medium body, smooth feel, good bitterness, carbonation is just right.  d: The label doesn't lie, this beer will ruin your palate and you will thank stone for it.

147,4083,VitBAficionado,4.72,"Glowing brass-orange color, with s rather small but thick looking almond colored head. Moderate lacing and little carbonation. Not surprisingly the nose is dominated by a beautiful array of hops of all kinds... floral, fresh cut grass, pine resin. Some lemon and grapefruit citrus manages to sneak in there as well however. Taste is like a full scale blitzkrieg... hops just immediately attack the palate with various varieties managing to make their presence felt this providing some variability even if my palate sucks to much to figure out what exactly. Amazingly though some resin/earth malt manages to come on slowly and while maybe not balancing the beer, it at least provides some refuge. To say the finish is bitter doesn't do it justice. Really nice medium-to-full body on this thing too. For the first time I actually get what all the fuss is about these big hop-heavy beers... alive, sexy and slightly abusive but in a naughty I like it kind of way. OK I'm gonna go be alone with the rest of the this now.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Pours a clear golden orange color with three fingers of frothy white head that slowly dissipates leaving lots of sticky lacing - can see each sip like reading rings on a tree stump. Intense fruity aroma with hints of grapefruit and pine trees - hops dominate this beer. Very dry and again the fruity hops are dominant with just a subtle malt character subsumed beneath it all. While intense, I appreciate the seeming restraint from an intense brewery like Stone - they don't overdo it here. This beer has a medium-heavy mouth feel, definitely a sipping beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,FtownThrowDown,4.23,"Pours a golden copper in color with a huge frothy head. The lacing that was left on the glass wouldn't even rinse off. Smell is hoppy, of course. There are plenty of varying hops in the taste. I would prefer more of the citrusy, juicy hops, but this beer gets it's name because of the bittering, tastebud crushing hop variety. This is a good all around beer. Mouthfeel is good and not tiring.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BMan1113VR,4.77,"Wow. Aroma is beautiful. Obviously expected this to be heavy on the hops, and it is with beautiful flower and perfume aromas. Malts come in the form of a bit of hay and nuts, but it is light. There is also honey and a bit of oak. It pours with virtually no head and has a slightly hazy body clarity. The color is a rich, peachy orange. Flavor is amazing, and your first sip really is the best, you can never get the same jubilation from drinking more (trust me, I tried). The flavor starts lightly sweet and then goes into a heavy bitterness. Mouth feel is oily. This brew has an intense, complex character, that in reality stays awhile, but I want it to last longer, to have that taste with me forever!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,atrus138,4.3,"Enjoyed a 22 oz bomber of this in my tulip glass. Bright and clear amber color with an extremely creamy white head. Head retention is decent and there's a whole lot of lacing. The smell is a wonderful cornucopia of scents. Lots of pine here, but also grass and citrus. Deliciously pungent. The taste is hugely complex. There is a solid malt undertone, but is totally overshadowed by the hops. This beer is HUGE. A bit sweet at first. Quite a bit of delicious fruity notes followed by a heavy dose of pine. Very bitter end. Finishes a bit dry. Solid medium body, with just the right amount of carbonation.  This is one over the top beer. A bit much for a night cap, as I tried to do, but definitely one I'll have again and again, I'm sure. I had this on tap once, and it was amazing. The fresher, the better with this one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Sponan,4.39,"Poured into a standard pint glass.  A-More of a gold than most others of the style. Good head and lacing.  S-Hops and grapefruit. Nothing overpowering.  T-Initial hit of hop bitterness followed by some citrus. Clean and refreshing.  M-Like the mouthfeel, but it is just a little thin to me..  D-This is one tasty beer going down. Could definitely drink more than one considering the low abv for the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,beerthulhu,3.8,"A: Poured a clear, light orange with a thin, creamy bubbly off white head that left a slight sticky lacing behind. Visible carbonation was very light almost non detectable.  S: On the nose was a ton of fresh citrus and grapefruit aroma and little else.  T: The initial flavor was hoppy and citric with fresh grapefruit. There was a lingering citrussy sweetness on a moderate fade that ended smoothly. One regard is it lacks depth flavor wise, but is a big overly done ipa that does what it was intended to do, assault you taste buds with a slap in the face amount of citrusy hops.  M: The mouthful was oily, slick with nil carbonation and some grassy hopping and dried citrus upon warming.  S: A very citrusy lemonade style ipa that was enjoyable but lacked complexity.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,IgotsHops,4.89,"This blew my mind. After tasting about 5 IPA's during the superbowl, this was by far the best out of the bunch.  Appearance: Huge 3 finger head that stayed on the beer for the whole drink. Good golden color with cloudy complexion.  Smell: Sweet flowers, citrus fruit, tropical starfruit, light honey tones, sweet pine. Incredible whiffs every time.  Taste: I made some inappropriate noises when I took almost every sip. I loved the sweet, sugary malt in this one. Caramel and toasted sugars in the malt sweetness, then the hops hit you. Floral, sweet, pine, citrus, sweet tropical fruit, all mixes perfectly with a surprising malt base.  Mouthfeel: Sugary and coats the tongue, but the flavors don't stop, and man I didn't want them to. The creaminess from the head helped each sip.  A-maze-ing.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Stoneman78,4.13,"OLD bottle of Rui which I believe may have been bottled ~2004 (San Marcos bottle), poured into an OG tulip glass, drinking to celebrate the Giants Super Bowl victory  Appearance is crystal clear light orange hue, head is frothy spotty white foam that sustains about half its mass, big thick lacing on the glass  Smell is sugary sweet malts (oranges, pine) and a mix of bready and caramel malts, slight grapefruit and brown sugar  Taste is surprisingly mild hop presence, more sweet than bitter, and a decent bread/caramel malt body, finishes with very slight bitterness and a little bit of alcohol warming  Mouthfeel is light-to-medium bodied, watery thin texture with a touch of oiliness, moderate carbonation withstands the test of time  Drinkability is high because the alcohol is barely perceptible and the hops are sweet-over-bitter, the malts are surprisingly present for a DIPA, Stone RUI is always a great choice and its been a treat to sample this aged version, the hops have held up well over time much like is seen in some of the older Stone Anniversary beers, I'm always coming back for more of this!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,gkatsoris,4.92,"A: Honey colored drink, w/ a nice thick head that stayed just long enough.  S: The most delicious enticing hop aroma ever. It was mesmerizing!! Floral hops.  T: Hops, hops and more hops. Just bitter enough (not like Arrogant Bastard bitter). Sweet floral hops.  M: Great carbonation. Really coats the tongue well.

147,4083,JayQue,4.47,"This is a great IPA. Poured into a pint glass. Nice white head amber fairly clear color and good lacing. Head holds up fairly good. Great aroma. Citrus and hops, nice and bitter. Taste is the same, smooth (probably some buried malt) citrus and pine and bitterness.  This is about as good as my favorite Celebration Ale with a little less richness and spiciness. Mouthfeel is rich enough, incredibly smooth and drinkable. At 7.70 abv, this is about as drinkable as a Double IPA gets. Really enjoyed this one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,DIM,4.07,"a: This one is a clear golden color, it lacks the amber highlights of most DIPAs. It pours with a medium sized white fizzy head that lasts.  s: Grapefruit and pineapple hops practicaly leap out of the bottle. Some pine and perhaps a hint of brown sugar as well.  t: Wow is this dry! The citric hops absolutley dominate here with just a whisper of sweetness for a malt backbone. While I often find DIPAs to be too sweet, I wouldn't have minded more malts from this one.  m: The carbonation is a bit too fizzy.  d: This is a very good example of a style I'm getting tired of.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

M: Medium body, tasty, well carbonated  O: Very good",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,JamesS,3.95,"Pours an nice dark amber color with very nice head and good lacing. Great hoppy scent, almost over whelming in it's flora. Excellent taste, very hoppy. It has a dry hopped taste as well, and finishes with a nice bitter aftertaste. Goes down fine, but a little dry at the end. A very good IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,MMAJYK,4.23,"A- Bright and dingy yellow light brown hues with bright white 1 finger head into my oversized wine glass. Lacing is very nice, but not too sticky.  S- Sour like a soured grapefruit with some pineapple thrown in. Little bit of a funky hop smell too and light brown sugar scents.  T- Grapefruit and dry up front with a sugary sweetness in the middle from the malt backing. Finish is very bitter on the back of the tongue Nice and complex.  M- Very sticky and oily with high carbonation sting.  D- I can easily consume this whole bomber with no problems!  Overall- I love IPA's of all varieties. IPA, 2IPA, love them all, so maybe I am partial. This is just a great beer.  I am drinking this one in memory of my buddy Rick; I just found out he died yesterday. He and I drank A LOT of beer together and he taught me to make moonshine like the best of 'em. This one is for him. RIP dude.

Awesome lacing remained on the height of the glass.  S- All hops. Smells strongly of grapefruit with hints of pine.  T- Full of hops. If there's any malt there, my taste buds haven't found it. One of the most bitter beers I've had. A bit of a lingering after taste  M- Medium bodied. Smoothe and oily.  D- Very bitter.

Will it ever die? Nice lacing though, very pertty.  S - Pineapple, citrus, strawberry, and grass. This is hop over-kill. Good thing I am a hop head.  T - Not bitter as I expected, but has a light maltiness to the beer, with bits of pine and citrus. Smells blended together and ""ruined"" the hoppy taste of this beer.  M - Light carbonation, no bitterness, and no alcohol feel.  D - I expected more pronounced flavors in the taste, but the aroma spoils me.

147,4083,wagenvolks,4.67,"Ahh ruination...one of my favorite breweries takes on my favorite style of beer. 12 oz. bottle into a tulip.  Pours a hazy, bright orange body, fervently carbonated to fuel an inch-thick, almond head. Great retention and decent lacing (I don't think the head ever disappeared). The aroma knocks me back with tart, spicy, sweet, piney, floral, resinous (and the list goes on...) HOPS. Fruity notes of banana, pineapple, and pear chime in alongside a sweet, sugary malt backbone. I'm intoxicated, and I haven't even taken the first sip.  The taste delivers on the bottle's promise: ""A liquid poem to the glory of the hop."" Fresh, resinous, sticky alpha acids immediately coat the palate. Juicy, fruity, malty notes round out the complex brigade of flavors. Ruination definately blasts the mouth with a ton of hops; I've had more initially punishing IIPAs before, but this brings the goods for a loooong time after you finish the beer. Drinkability is top notch, it's complex, tasty, and a hop-lover's delight.

Poured a light straw with a big head that mellowed down and stayed as a film all the way down leaving a little lacing. This is the first time I've had it in bottle even though I've had it on tap a couple of times. Everything seems milder. Aroma is of pine needles, mild grapefruit and surprisingly a real mild sweetness at the end of the nose. Taste is full frontal hops. Like sticking my tongue in a handful of pine needles but finishing with a balance of malt that I had not tasted before. Mouthfeel is medium with light carbonation. Stone makes great beer.

147,4083,dsa7783,3.62,"Another full-flavored, ultra-rich beer from Stone... their Ruination IPA is perhaps the ultimate example of an extreme Imperial IPA... appearance is copper/golden and the aroma is literally bursting with strong hops... upon opening the bottle, you are greeted with an extreme aroma of rich hoppy flavor... taste complements the aroma, with hop richness and bitterness pulling through... very bitter aftertaste with strong astringent taste... decent mouthfeel but average drinkability due to the extreme hop sensation and hefty 7.7% ABV... really good, full-flavored stuff, but really powerful to the point of almost being overhwelming... a potent beer with full-flavor chracteristic typical of Stone...

147,4083,Phocion,4.53,"These last couple weeks I have had an insatiable craving for hops that nothing has seemed to satisfy. I even had a 120 Minute IPA last night which didn't do the trick. So now I'm going all out and hitting this 'liquid poem to the glorious hop.' Also keep in mind this bottle is probably about a year old.  Pours a beautiful clear amber with a constant flow of fine bubbles racing up to meet the massive stubborn white head that almost looks like a snow-covered mountain range and leaves a thick, rocky lacing as it finally falls down my glass. Absolutely beautiful.  The aroma is, duh, hops. Pine needles and grapefruit lead the way, followed by grassy and floral hops, orange, lemon, and a thick caramel malty layer that in any other beer would take over by itself, but in this baby is simply no match for the sheer hoppiness.  The bitterness isn't as strong as I remember. Maybe it mellowed with age or my tolerance has gone up since my last Ruination. Either way, it is surprisingly well-balanced... well, for double IPA standards anyway. My palette is overcome with a full spectrum of every sort of hoppy flavor imaginable, but with just enough of a roasted and caramel maltiness to compensate. Very dry finish.  Dry but well-carbonated and full-bodied mouthfeel, and ridiculously tasty. This one should be avoided by anyone afraid of a little bit of hops; it should also be avoided by anyone not afraid because it is ridiculously easy to drink for such an ""extreme"" beer... Very solid and in my experience the best of its style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,bobsy,4.72,"Bomber from Coit Liquors in San Francisco. Pours a cloudy golden orange with a whiter-than-white head, which leaves generous lacing to the last drop. Lovely fresh hop aroma, with notes of citrus. The flavour is packed with hops, and grapefruit and pine elements. The bitterness is actually very manageable and bracing. The finish is smooth and dry, with a huge dose of bitterness that lingers longingly in the mouth.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,illidurit,4.13,Light orangey gold color with an extremely sticky head. Lacing is monstrous.  Smells like a fistful of pine needles shoved into the nostrils.  Taste consists of a massive dose of grapefruit rind and pine trampling an undercurrent of caramel maltiness.  Pretty smooth but quite sticky. Heavy in body and not particularly drinkable from the hop explosion.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,watchnerd,4.74,"What more can one say about this (in)famous brew that hasn't already been said?  Now that I've lived with it for a while, I can honestly say it's bit of a novelty beer. It's amazing at what it does, namely, assault your nose and mouth with one of the most intense beer tasting experiences around. What it doesn't do well: it doesn't go well with food (too dominant), and it's too big and kick ass to be a good session beer. I can't imagine drinking three or more pints of this without having my tongue and nose go numb and possibly inducing some kind of permanent sensory deprivation. For serial drinking or drinking with food, the other Stone offerings are actually better, more balanced choices. But once in a while, you just need to be tied up, spanked, and forcefed until you cry out with the safe word. For that, break out the Ruination and start begging.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,oakbluff,4.67,"12 ounce bottle courtesy of IrishKyle- thanks bro! Pours a neon cloudy kumquat, with minimal head.Nose- sweet candied tropical fruit. Taste- hop blast to the tongue. Pine, grapefruit rinds and mango. Doughy malts keep the hops in check and a creaminess to the mouthfeel. Hops are very drying in the finish and makes the palate crave more. Truly a classic west coast hop bomb. Carbonation is medium and drinkability is high. Great stuff",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,OtisinAZ,4.42,"WOW!! A great beer that poored a nice lite amber color with a decent sized head. Lacing formed along the top of the glass,did not follow to the bottom.

147,4083,dac,4.75,"Cask Ale available a couple places in SoCal. Copper color with a fine thick off-white head from the hand pump draw.  Big hop aroma of pine, citrus and cat piss that knocks your socks off!  The hops attacks the senses from all directions, aroma, flavor and intense bitterness.  Ample malt supports the onslought of hops and perpetuates the sensations long after swallowing. The hand pump lends a creaminess to the mouthfeel and the hop resins give a prickleing sensation on the gums and roof of the mouth.  After the initial hops shock is gone this beer actually has a lot going on. Complex malt and ester flavors of caramel, plum and raisin are discernable and the warmth of an ample alcohol content becomes apparent.  This beer is quite drinkable for a ""sipping beer"". Finishing a pint of it makes you long for the next one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S: Citrus and piney hoppiness with a caramel malt backbone underneath. A little hard to pick any thing that stands out, but balance is very well done. Good retention, minimal lace.  T: Very clean taste of grapefruit and some lemon zest, a sweeter portion of citrus fruit as well. Bitterness on back end is not explosive but very balanced in its intensity. Even a slightly herbal character. Pretty good.  M/D: Mouthfeel is very nice. Carbonation is noticable but the body is medium-light and feels good on the tongue, with not hints of alcohol. Drinkability is perfect, very refreshing beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Hojaminbag,4.5,"Stone Ruination has a golden-yellow body with a good amount of active carbonation bubbles. The head is about 2 fingers tall and is a light tan color; it is thick and cream, showing great retention as it clings to glass. Great look for a IIPA.  Ruination has a powerful hop aroma, you can practically feel the bitterness in your nose. Grapefruit and pine make appearances also.  Hops, Very strong hops, and more hops is a good way to describe Ruination. They all come in one giant blast of hop flavor too. A good amount of grapefruit and pine mix with massive amounts of tongue-attacking bitterness and hints of lemon. Just a bit of pale, sweet malt come through in the end, but the bitterness strangles it even as it pops up; it barely makes an impression. Ruination is aptly named, because after drinking one of these you really want taste anything for the rest of the night.  Ruination feels oily while in the mouth, with above average carbonation that is a little bit surprising, but fitting. The body still manages to feel smooth and creamy.  Stone Ruination is a must-try for any hopheads out there, it is a perfect example of a hopped-up west coast IIPA. Besides that, it also hides the alcohol content extremely well, and every bottle has a bottling date stamped on it so you know that it's fresh.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,AaronRed,4.79,"Pours a wonderful clear straw color- foaming a bit. Aromas burst out of the glass, floral and citrus all around.

Just a great flavorful beer, and seemed very fresh.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,josiahschlender,4.82,"I'm not going to deny that I love hops and double IPAs. Ruination IPA is one of the best I've had, I'll try not to gush too much.  The color is pretty light for this type of beer. It's a clear, attractive golden orange with a good lasting creamy head. Poured from a badass gargoyle-stamped bottle.  This is one of those beers that you can smell across the room. It explodes with fresh, oily hops. Lots of bright citrus (grapefruit the strongest) and sharp pine scents. Just a little toasted malt, but not much can cut through the hop assault. Even as the head goes down, Ruination continues to waft pleasantly around.  Fortunately, the taste is more rounded. More hearty, light malts are noticeable to compliment the citrus. Drinking this beer reminds me of eating a perfectly sweet and tangy grapefruit with a golden piece of toast. Bitterness is strong, but the sweetness of the malts and citrus tang prevent it from being a pucker bitter beer. If you're eating anything, this beer will obliterate whatever you tasted last. The flavors are complex and keep going and going.  Mouthfeel is creamy, slick and substantial. It rounds out the hefty flavors, I'm glad it's not too thin.  The hops will bring me back to this beer again. Stone has done an incredible job with making this beer completely over the top and yet incredibly good. At $5+ a 22oz bomber and being such a tastebud scorcher, it's anything but a session beer, but it's not enough to drop down the drinkability in my opinion.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Drinkability is good,,but i think one or 2 would be sufficient.

147,4083,Hatch,4.5,"Poured from a 12oz bottle. I love the bottles Stone Brewery uses; very unique. Has a ""best before"" date printed at the bottom of the bottle.  Pours a dark straw color, amber, with hints of orange coming through. Forms a nice white head about a finger deep that fades into some very nice lacing that sticks around throughout the entire experience. A very nice looking beer.  Smells of hops, hops, and more hops!! Smells of fruity pine, with some slight alcohol coming through; a sweet hoppy smell.  Taste as good as it smells. You get the bite of the malt at first then the bitterness of the hops comes in, leaving a very bitter, piny aftertaste. The alcohol warms on the way down, but is well hidden. A very good balance of malt and hops. Although the label on the beer makes it out to be a little more intimidating than it actually is, it remains a very good representation of a double IPA.  Mouthfeel is very good; not really thick, but definitely not thin; almost oily. Nice amount of carbonation to give it a mild crisp feel.  This is a very drinkable beer, even for 7.7% ABV, which is well hidden throughout the entire experience. Hopheads will love this beer, but so will anyone else who enjoys a good IPA. More bitter than your average IPA, but hey, that's what they were trying to do.  Notes: Definitely one of the better double IPAs out there and it gets props for being on of the easier to find ones.

Herbal/floral almost a minty-like intensity.  M - Full body, slick and soft carbonation.  D - Pretty tasty and I do like this.

147,4083,abcsofbeer,4.12,Poured from a 22oz bomber with a slightly cloudy and light amber color. There is a good amount of carbonation and rising bubbles. The beer is topped by a 11/2 finger head that is off-white in color and provides a good deal of sticky lacing.  The aroma is comprised of a large amount of flowery pine scents. The hop smell is quite abundant and is more than adequate for the style. The taste is a fabulous blend of hoppy but smooth and a good amount of tasty malts. The hoppiness gets more apparent and plentiful as it warms and you fall to the bottom of the glass.  The mouthfeel is held together by the spicy and bold hop flavor and body. There is a surprising amount of smoothness to this IPA too. Very nice and tasty.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,WoodHammer,4.37,"Appearance: Beautiful straw color. Decent head with a good pour, but retention is somewhat lacking; of course, typical for style and low protein content.  Smell: Hop aroma with a hint of sweetness. Personally my favorite part of this beer.  Taste: Boom - brilliantly bitter with long lingering hop effect.  Mouthfeel: Good - astringent as expected. Not thin like a lighter pale ale, but full  Drinkability: This is NOT a marathon beer and after one or two your taste buds will be shot. Oh well, you can't have it all.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Flavor carries heavy citric tones with more bitterness throughout. I am drinking this one right after the Stone IPA and I find this one to be more robust and thorough. The IPA is a bit tamer and this one is a bit...""harsher"", shall we say.

Taste is a blast of grapefruit and earthy hops, with subtle carbonation, delicious tingly bitterness, and toasty malt that keeps things from being one-sided. Mouthfeel is really perfect for having so little malt flavor; it's thick enough to keep the hops from abusing your tongue. Similar to Three Floyds Alpha King, with broader, more complex bitterness, and a touch less malt.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Mouthfeel is smooth & it is drinkable for a big DIPA. I am spoiled that I can buy this whenever I want. Probably the definition of the style.  Cheers.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,EPICAC,4.13,"On tap at Bukowski's in Boston.  Appearance: Pours a nice copper with a light haziness to it. Topped by a creamy beige head that fades slowly to a film, leaving sheets of lace.  Smell: The hops really dominate the aroma. There's a fainty sugary maltiness that's eveident, but herbal, resiny and citric hops are at center stage here. There's also a hint of grassiness.  Taste: Toasty maltiness followed by some caramel sweetness are evident briefly. Resiny and citric hops soon take over making for a very bitter finish with a bit of alcoholic spice.  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied. Moderate carbonation. A bit of oiliness.  Drinkability: Pretty strong and hoppy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,NCBeernut,4.32,"I found this bottle at New Beer while in NYC. They don't have this back home, so I had to grab a bomber.  Nice hazy golden orange, two finger head that fades to a thin layer that leaves some good lacing.  Smell and taste almost identical. Fresh pineapple, even more prevalent in the nose than taste. Floral citrusy hops are all over the place. Definite honey presence makes itself known, and is more obvious in the taste than the smell. This sweetness tries to help balance but ultimately fails. A bit of orange in the aftertaste.  Very pleasant mouthfeel at the beginning, then sticky, hop oils cling to your mouth everywhere. It seriously is almost like chewing a raw hop flower (yes, I have done this before).  This beer defines a hop bomb. It really could use a little more malt to help balance. The hop shortage is probably due to Stone Ruination. If you don't love hops, then don't even touch it. As for me, I won't have any trouble finishing this bomber.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,JohnGalt1,3.95,"22oz from the Coop for about $4 (I think.. could be more could be less) ... shared with Brenda.. mine from a shaker pint.  nice big head atop an only slightly hazy yellow brew... lite lacing suprisingly.  smell is citrus floral and pine hops... no malts to speak of.  big bitterness and lite/medium body.. could use a touch more viscosity.. hop flavor is pretty comples... floral melts into citrus rinds... in to the pine... only enough malt flavor to be noticeable... IMHO, it could use more malt flavors and body.  I know everyone loves this one, but I would not put Ruination in my top 10 DIPA's... too one dimensional.. and yes I know that's what the Stone boys were inetending... but I would appreciate a touch more malts.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Mebuzzard,4.63,"So, this is my second review of this beer almost a year after the first. I must say this is a great brew. Glossy mahagony body with orange and slight brown tints. It glows. Very nice, smooth, conformed white head. Sticky. Laced the glass well. Aroma is crisp and citrusy. The alcohol peaks through a bit, but remains hidden. The hops really load the nose. Taste is very up-front. A slight hint of orang peel, grapefruit, flower, and green stems is slammed out of the way by the bite of the hops. Tingy. Almost like a spice bite, but more crisp. Nice flavor hides the alcohol. I bought a bomber, so this is gonna be a battle of my taste buds with the hops. A bit hard to drink this big bottle.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,DIPAbrewer,3.93,"Stone just recently began distributing here in MD so I finally got a chance to sample this extreme ale. I poured it from a 12 oz bottle into a wine glass and was struck by how light it was. Many big hoppy beers like this look a little more amber, orange, or ruby this one is a full gold.  The Aroma was grapefruit and pine backed by sweet malt. I wasn't knocked out by the aroma, but it was there and fairly complex.  The flavor is this ale's best attribute. It is sharply bitter but somewhat balanced by rich sweet malt flavor. When I say balanced you must consider the source. I am a serious hophead and haven't found a beer yet that was too hoppy.  The mouthfeel and drinkability were both pretty good as well, I could drink two but probably wouldn't. This is a good beer to end the night with, unless you've got some very hoppy Imperial Stouts lined up.  If you're a hophead you need this beer if not, why are you reading this?",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,sever,3.8,"Wow, this is an intense beer.  This beer is all about hops. And dryness. It pours a thin head, and the aroma is super strong pine-sol grapefruit. Immediately the beer sucks all the moisture out of your tounge and replaces it with a spicy hop symphony! The aroma and taste are overwhelming! This beer will cut through your palate and replace it with damn hoppy beer in no time flat. I If you think there's no such thing as too much hops, try this beer. You'll discover just how much of a hophead you really are.t is ludicrously enjoyable. However, it is exceptionally dry and strong, and you won't always be in the mood for it. It is an IPA, but one made with no regard to anything but itself. This is everything but a neutral beer. You will either find it disgusting or worship it. When you are in the mood, this beer is will hold its own as one of the most lovely aggressively hopped beers out there. As insanely hoppy as it is I find it pleasuring and satisfying. Brutal!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,caminiti,4.42,"Very drinakable brew for the high IBU and IPA. Poured from a 22 oz. bomber from Olivers, the source of most of my beers, on a lousy, cold, snowy, icy night, this was meant to bring me in from shoveling and cheer me up, and it did. Appearance is orange and a bit hazy, smell is exactly what you would expect from the advertising, hops, hops, more hops a little sweetness/fruit. The beer goes down well, maybe too easily, for the 7.7%. A great beer and worth it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,lightindarkness,4.54,"In my search to drink the best IPAs I can put my lips to, this seemed an obvious try. I picked up this 12oz bottle the other day and saved it for a special occasion - a random Thursday night.  It poured a slightly hazy golden-orange color. There was a decent foamy head that sat down to some patchy creamy bubbles as I let it warm up a bit in the glass. There was a pretty good coating of patchy lace around the glass as I emptied it.  This beer has a very attractive aroma, with plentiful hops and some fruity sweetness. The piney bitterness is really concealed well in the richness of the scent, masked with floral tones and soft fruit.  A nice full taste with each sip, filled with plenty (maybe plenty is an understatement) of hops and fruit, some rounded sweetness of flowers. Regardless of the of the up-front taste, the complexity and flavor are shattered at the finish of this beer with an overwhelming dry, hoppy backlash of bitterness, leaving a chewy toasty, hoppy taste. This dies down with some time to a bready residual flavor. Hoppy. Hoppy. Hoppy.  The mouthfeel Is relatively calm for the 100 IBU, 7.7% alcohol content makeup of this beer. Finishes with a smoldering feel that I keep trying to quench with more sips.  I find this beer surprisingly drinkable, despite its intense characteristics. As artfully crafted IPAs go, this beer is not as intimidating as its label suggests, as long as you like hops.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Tilley4,4.85,"I'm not worthy of this beer.  I had delayed trying this beer because after reading some of the reviews, I was of the opinion that it was just an over the top beer that was trying to be too extreme. I was on a beer run a couple hours away from the house and saw this 12 oz bottle on the shelf and thought, ""What the heck!"" Best decision I've made beer-wise ever.  I can't imagine a beer being much better than this. Beautiful glowing honey color that smelled wonderfully hoppy but not overly so.  I was expecting this beer to be really bitter and extreme, but it's so drinkable, it's dangerous. It is a hoppy beer but I actually found myself wishing it was a bit more so. I was expecting something that would make me put it down and say, ""What have I gotten myself into?"" That being said, this may very well be the best beer that I've ever had in my life. It was a bit bitter on the finish but not overly so and all the hype that it has was worth it. It is that damn good. I will no longer pass this up when I see it. I will have this in my beer fridge at ALL times from this moment on. I'm headed up in a few weeks to grab some Dreadnaught and I'm curious to see how it stacks up.  Again, excellent beer! Highly, highly recommended!!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,altgeeky1,4.68,"Pours light caramel, with a very healthy head. Head takes a while to settle down, to a lace around the edges and across the top.  Smells like an extreme IPA. You can smell this from the nose, or just by inhaling you can 'feel' the hops and alcohol in your throat. Can't say more -- you know what you're in for next!!  Tastes sweet malt, with hops moving to the front quickly. After a swallow, a slight alcohol burn moves in. The hops? The hops are beautiful and stay with you for minutes.  Mouthfeel is pretty good.. more malt body than you expect. The beer just kind of 'rolls' in your mouth from the hops and the malt. The carbonation is very comfortable.  This beer goes down very well. You can sip it, or drink it more like a session beer. IPA's are not for everyone, and this one especially is quite heavy on the hops. In terms of taste, the alcohol is surprisingly not overpowering.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,smurphy77,4.97,"This beer might be a best-in-class beer it's so good. It's really an exceptional IPA.  The beer poured a golden color with a medium-sized head that stuck around for awhile before dissipating. The aromas were succulent fresh hops and perhaps a hint of apples. Lovely, bright hop aromas were really perfectly balanced and not at all overpowering, portending the taste to come.  The taste of this beer was textbook IPA. You taste the smell, you taste the bitterness, you taste the freshness. The vortex of hoppiness swirls over the tongue in such a clean, crisp, refreshing way that could just never get old.  Lucky enough to find a sixer of this at bevmo in san jose for 6.99. What a deal. Too bad I'm only here for a week.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mj71,4.69,"A: Poured a two-fingered very white head that dissipated semi-quickly. Deep golden color with a hint of red and cloudiness.  S: This may be the best smelling brew I've ever experienced. Now I get what the hop-heads crave. Very fresh, very pungent hop scent.  T: Solid malt balance completely quashes the hop bite until well into the sip. Slight fruity characteristic detected, but I'm a little congested, so I may be missing some of the more subtle flavors.  M: Thick, creamy mouth-feel. Extremely smooth.  D: Certainly a beer to be savored. High ABV and lingering hoppy taste encourage a slow pace.  I tend to shy away from most Hop Monsters like this one because they're just bitter, bitter, bitter. I decided to give this a shot because of Todd Alström's review. What a great decision. Just wish it wasn't $14 a six-pack in my neck of the woods.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Lupe,4.49,"Golden orange in color with a foamy off white head of a cappuccino, that leaves some lace and has some staying power.  Big citrusy and piney hop aroma - perfume like. A bit of spice as well, and a touch of toasted malt and fruitiness makes for a very aromatic beer.  Hop flavors are definitely the main attraction. First soft and floral before getting more aggressive and citrusy. Finally shows all it's muscle with a heavy dose of resiny piney goodness. This is one hoppy beer, but does not fry the palate as I had expected. A nice amount of toasted grain and sweet malt flavors are melded well with the hops. Finishes dry and puckering. Great complex flavors.  Medium in body with a silky smooth mouthfeel and slightly creamy. Good drinkability for the style, but I can't see have more than two of these before needing a break. Alcohol stays well hidden.  I don't know if it was from all of the hops in this, but I was so relaxed after finishing a bottle. Great beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BeerImmediately,4.59,"A: UUUUge 5 finger 'ed on this puppy... lightly clouded, deep golden color.  S: smell is incredible - ripe pineapple wafted out of the bottle and continued in the glass. Fresh, fresh hops.  T: reminded me of orange juice - both taste and mouthfeel. Sweet, candy-like taste that transformed to grapefruit as it warmed.  M: I was expecting a much sharper mouthfeel, but this was smooth and almost rich.  D: Boy, I enjoyed this one. Get yourself some!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,kwakwhore,4.4,"12 oz. bottle which came via trade. Big ups to jcdiflorio for the hookup. Beautiful large white head on top of a copper/gold somewhat hazy pour. Lacing down the glass. Aromas are redolent of pine, and citrus hoppyness but a bit of sweet malt manages to sneak through. Hop perfume might be an appropriate description. As far as the flavors are concerned hops are definitely the main course, but this beer is not the total shred job that my palate had expected. Biscuit malt and sweet malt flavors are melded with the hops to make a complex and interesting flavor combination. The mouthfeel is silky and has a prickly carbonation which lingers on the back of the tongue and on the palate. This beer is a pleasure to drink. I could easily have had another and will definitely be on the lookout for more.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,timtim,4.15,"clearish orangey gold with an off white head that settled pretty quickly but left really nice lace. hops in the nose are georgeous. pine and citrus (grapefruit). only wish was that it had a little more of a solid malt backbone to carry the hops... i know it's a dipa, but my favorites still have that faint biscuity or sweet malty character for the hops to ride on. taste is delicious nonetheless. medium body with a nice, soft silkiness. a bit of a bitter finish, but really, really pleasant. pour me another please.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Murchmac,4.58,"Easily in my top two of all time favorite beers.  Pours like a perfect double IPA, cloudy orange in the middle with radiant burst of sunlight on the outside.  Smells of sweet sticky malts, lemon, the hop smell is almost transcended to just a citrus smell.  POW!!! The first taste hits you with everything it has. Stingy pine taste, some alcohol, great malt balance. Hops Hops and more Hops. Sweetness, creaminess, and alcohol round it out.  This mouthfeel gives you the resiny stickiness that coats your entire mouth, tongue, and throat like a good DIPA should.  I could drink this beer forever.

147,4083,orangedive,4.39,"A - Orangish Gold. 1.5 inch head. 10% opaque.  S - Smells like a giant hop. Hints of grapefruit. Lots of citrus. Mostly just hops.  T - Hoppy-hoppy. Bitter but still slightly sweet. A little bit of alcohol in the aftertaste. Really nice. Possibly a slight note of banana. This beer is an aggressive IPA but has a very friendly taste. Highly recommended.  M - Smooth. Not as powerful as I expected based on their own description. Medium bodied. A little creamy.  D - Great. For as strong and bitter as it is, this beer is remarkablely easy to drink. Drinking a bomber...could easily have another.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,tfuchs,4.25,"Ah, with only 991 reviews, I'm sure you really need my opinion to make sense of this one. Whatever, it's my first review and this is a great beer to start with.  12oz bottle I picked up at Lost Dog (great place) in Falls Church. Poured into a heavy 14oz. glass mug that I was lucky enough to inherit from my girlfriend's grandfather. No date on the bottle. :(  Appearance: was pale amber, like illuminated pine wood all laquered up. It held a firm, thin head. Thick to move when swirled.  Big Nose: this is one of those times when it just smells like HOPS. But yeah, orange citrus up front with a load of butter to follow it up. It's a big beer, so there's a lot of caramel and sugar hiding down there too.  Taste Taste: HOPS, butter and citrus just like the nose. Honey and alcohol in the aftertaste. I love hops. This isn't (supposed to be) a balanced beer. Please don't buy it expecting that. It's reminiscent of DFH's 90 min, but there's less depth to the malty undertones in this one. If you are a hophead and you don't love this, you are weird. If you're not a hophead, you're welcome to try, but just understand what it is.  The feeling in my mouth when I drink it: is nice. Again, my preferences is for big beers, and this is one of 'em. So with 7.7% abv and enough hops to eat a goat it's not surprising that this beer is thick. I can feel the hop juice tingling the back of my tongue. And, I did let this warm from the fridge for a few minutes, gave it a few rubs and junk, but it was a bit too cold. It loosened up nicely after I let it warm and breathe as I drank't.  Drinkability: is very high, but I am insane. Besides, the 1,000,000,000 lupilin count makes me sleepy. Not really. Anyway, I nurse these bad boys 'cause of the price, not the taste. If these guys were any cheaper ($15 / 6er) I'd have one every day.  All-in-All, this is a big beer. A big, hoppy, nuts, novel, American beer. I love it. If you don't like HOPS or having fun, stay away from this one. Because these guys don't deserve to be trashed or (and I can't believe how many people actually do this) poured out.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,pershan,4.35,"Tried this at home in a 12 oz bottle.  A: Straw-colored with a creamy white head.  S: Pine-dominated hop aroma.  T: Smooth hop flavor followed by a stronger pine-dominated hop bitterness. The bitterness stays with you long after you swallow.  M: Consistent hop bitterness along the top, sides, and back of the tongue - a hop-head's fantasy.  D: This is what all other IPAs should try to emulate : a clean, smooth flavor profile with a strong, consistent hop presence all the way to the bottom of the glass - excellent beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

This baby was great from the get go from sight, smell and swill ! Really well balanced for the style, creamy but not thick, piney/ citrusy with a cat urine quality that one would think would be a bitter bomb but just sits well and long enough to please not overpower. I really enjoyed this and definitely a returnable DIPA.

147,4083,Traquairlover,4.02,"22-oz. bottle poured into two pint glasses.  A = Dark honey colored, misty translucence. Huge head which left good but not incredible lacing.  S = Sweet, floral notes. I had expected a more bitter hops smell but although the hops are unmistakable, there is a sweet, honey smell in there.  T = Wow, the immediate taste has some of the sweetness I detected in the smell, but that is quickly replaced with a lot of bitters which lasts well into a long finish. There are also nice hints of pine and citrus flavors. I feel like I just sucked on a lemon that had bee soaked in a nice English pale ale. Not at all unpleasant, but quite bitter in the aftertaste.  M = Nice full mouthfeel, good carbonation with small bubbles lends to a fullness as you swish it around your mouth.  D = I liked this beer but I would give it only slightly above average in drinkability. It is very bitter without having the full hops flavors I would expect. As a result, I would probably pick another DIPA if that were what I particularly wanted and I think it might grow old quickly unless paired with a nice salty food that would help counter the extreme bitterness.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mattster,3.51,"Poured from 22oz bottle into a snifter glass. Very nice color - a darker gold as expected. Good light head with nice bubbles. Good clarity - very translucent.  Taste buds are innundated with hoppy goodness, but nothing bad... Actually quite good. Slight hints of citrus, bits of lemon zest, and slight spicy hues.  Mouthfeel is coating, but not overwelming. I'd love to have a good steak with this... I know I say that a lot, but this is a Definite food beer. Stone's Imperial IPA is a great beer. A new one for my favorites.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Aggressive, sharp, tongue-curling bitterness on the first sip. After a couple more, the hops are much more balanced with one another. Piney. Citrus. Delicious. No detectable malt characters here, but I'm not complaining.  Carbonation is just right. Nice and effervescent. Hops dance around on my palette.

A - Vibrant golden swirl with a 1/2 inch of froth head that hung out for a bit. Almost glows as it goes down, and leaves a bit of lacing as well. To describe it in one word - Impressive.  S - A girl at my table said it smelled like an old gym locker. She was crazy, this is a big floral hop smell with sweet orange citrus notes.  T - Amazing. It's a hop bomb of course. High bitterness with a mellow burn to the tongue. Sweet perfume like flower profile blends it together and balances this beer out almost perfectly. It even finishes a bit sweet and it's pretty hard to taste the alcohol.  M - Perfect feel to this medium bodied brew. Excellent carbonation level with a smooth smooth finish. Can't ask for anything else.  D - Pretty good, I could do a few before having to stop. They say it's a double but by how well rounded it is, you could never tell.

T- This is where this beer really shines. I was surprised by the first sip. I expected a bitter beer and wasn't sure what kind of flavor it would have. It is a complex taste that stimulates the entire palate. While it is a bitter beer, the bitterness is realitively mild, the hops taste is perfect and there is a slight hint of citrus. An excellent beer for anyone who likes their beer slightly bitter.  M- Excellent mouthfeel. Starts off smooth and develops well leaving a nice little bite at the end.  D- Decent drinkablility, higher than average alcohol content and the residual bitterness takes it down a little but it is definately a good beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,MobBarley,4.8,"I finally stumbled across a source for this legendary brew in our area and am pleased that it lives up to the hype. It's mellow golden color lulls the victim into thoughtful repose, its nose a stark and mysterious, sharp one. The taste is as one would expect...a razor thin foundation of malt only serving as a launching point for the hoppy pyrotechnics. The flavor is complex and satisfying, but the medicinal quality of the hop oils in this one make the mouthfeel my favorite aspect. This heavy dose of lupulin also leads to the one less than awesome facet of this beer experience. The drinkability suffers, in my case, because great care is required to avoid the spins and drowsiness and thus it is, as we say, a ""sipper"". But...I've got time. Top notch beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S: The high ABV is apparent just from the smell. Citrousy and tangy.  T: Bitter but not overly so. Not much malt sweetness evident. The alcohol is noticeable.  M: Lighter than I would have imagined, but makes sense without the syrupy sweetness a lot of beers use to balance the hops. Carbonation was a little on the light side, which was a good thing.  D: High ABV keeps it to a single serving per session, but slowly sipping on one of these will certainly make for a good night.  I'll keep this beer in mind if I ever see it on tap somewhere, but I personally prefer the hops I love to be better balanced with malt.

S: It had a very distinct and earthy and spicy hop aroma that was tempered by an under current of sweet malts.  T: There was an initial semi sweet profile on the front end of the sip followed immediately by a bold but not obnoxious bitter profile that lasted until I swallowed. I enjoyed the tangy citrusy flavors (lemon and yellow grapefruit) and spicy peppers. The taste of this brew follows the nose providing a nice rounded experience.  M: It had a classic IPA hop bitterness that permeated my mouth with each sip. This medium bodied brew did not have a hop profile that lingered leaving an aggresively bitter or sour aftertaste. I was pleased at how clean and refreshed my mouth was after each sip.  D: A bit to bitter for my taste but for an IPA this is undoubtedly a brew that I could enjoy over and over during a long session. I would prefer letting it breath and drinking it very cold.  Comment: I am not a hop head yet I enjoyed this brew. I was especially surprised to read on the bottle that it was rated by the brewer at 100 IBU (normally about 40 IBU tops my taste tolerance). The excellent balance and ABV of 7.7% made this among the finest IPAs I have experienced recently. I might not seek it out but I definitely will never turn it away.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,sleazo,4.5,"I lived in San Diego for 2.5 years and I finally review this in NY? Oh well.  A-Beautiful burnt amber haze. A fluffy two fingered head sits nicely atop the brew with Peter North like staying power. Lacing is impressive to say the least. Rings cling to the sides of my stange.  S_A real nice caramel sweetness offsets the brash piney and grapefruity abrasive hop scent. Vague hints of alcohol are the only thing keepig this from a 5.  T-The initial hint of sweetness is combatted by a brash in your face pine/grapefruit scented hop taste. There is a balance of taste here that is excellent. The aftertaste leaves a resinous hop bitterness that one would want in their 2xIPA. The grapefruit zest is evident clearly throughout. the alcohol does peek through a bit when you belch.  M-Medium bodied but with that good resinous hop feel to the aftertaste  D-This definitely leans to the hop side of the fence but there is a good balance from the malt. This is a good hop bomb, and a bomb I wish was dropped in NYC more often. I think this is also a beer that can usse a bit of time to get some of the harshness out. Newer bottles tend to be a bit harsh.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Tolann,4.09,"High expectations for this beer, and I'd have to say it's pretty good. Maybe not quite up to all the hype, but still very enjoyable. I'd order it again. This review was enjoyed in a typical pint glass.  A - golden reddish. a lil cloudy. few bubbles. Nice head that hangs around. some lacing S - floral hops, slightly sweet. T - orange citrus, hoppy and sweet. not too harsh M - well-rounded, and smooth. bitter on the back of your tongue. Medium body; not too heavy, but not lively either. D - quite nice. For some reason its giving me a wheat beer feel. It must be the orange I'm picking up. The hops are real nice.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BeerSox,4.77,"12oz bottle into nonic.  One doesn't need to be beer savvy to know that this one is going to be an aggressiver beer. Just looking at the label gives enough clues to figure it out. The gargoyle from your nightmares made it onto the bottle of your beer, and now you're going to drink it.  The beer itself is honey-amber in color with a light haze. A one finger khaki head slowly settles to a thin rim, leaving a solid coating along the glass. The lacing sticks pretty well to the glass. It's a characteristic of hoppy beers, they just create great lacing.  The aroma explodes with cascade hop aroma that mimics concentrated grapefruit juice. There is a bit of spice in there as well giving it a little zip. Not much of the malt makes it through, and the alcohol aromas don't fare too either.  This is the first IPA this strong I have had in a long time, and the bitterness took me by surprise. Very sharp hop flavor (again, grapefruit) pretty much summarizes the beginning. As the hops fade some of the malt slowly emerges, giving a very sweet grain flavor. Mixed in there is a little bit of citrusy zest. Lots of body (full bodied) with the right amount of carbonation, keeping it from being flat without the fizz. The grain fades quicker than the hops, which linger for a while after each sip.  I would say this one lived up to the hype. It's not for everybody, considering how bitter it is, but if that's what you're looking for, this is a great one to try. It's bitter but still allows for complexity. Careful with the amount of alcohol though, it can sneak up on you. Recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,CarolinaCardinals,4.35,"Review 10-20-07 Picked up a bomber from Sprouts back in May. It has been awhile since i sipped on one and reviewed this.  A - Beer poured an amber orange with a nice tall white head that is sustaining nicely. 4.5 S - The nose is quite pleasant, nothing but floral hops. 4.5 T - Taste is quite the same, a hop bomb thru and thru, citrus notes and pine resin overwhelming the palate. 4.5 M - Mouthfeel is medium to heavy bodied, well carbonated, and it glides nicely across the palate. 4.5. O - Drinkability is perfect. The abv is not overwhelming like some of the malt bombs that are out there. It is a near perfect example of the double ipa style. 5.0.  Re-Review 1-22-12. Purchased 11-23-11 from Total Wine for $3.49. Best by 12.28.11. Been in the beer fridge since the purchase. A - Beer poured orange with a nice white head that dissapated quickly. 4.0. S - Nose is a truckload of citrus hops. 4.0 T - Hops are definitely forward, citrus and pine dominate. Malt is definitely there but the hops win in the end. 4.5.

MF- coarse and violent, in a good way. not soft and luxuriant like her little sister, this bitch says ""like it or die"". and she's right. puckering and mealy, a little powdery, with a subdued creaminess.

147,4083,mnstorm99,4.2,"22oz. bomber thanks to younger35 Apperance is a nice golden orange color with a nice head that lacks a little bit of lacing for the style. Aroma is of orange citrus from the hops with a nice malty backbone. Taste is much of the same except now along with the nice orange flavors the hops (magnum) give it a nice spicy tinge to it. I could definatly have a few of these, if Stone ever came to Minny, this one could be a mainstay in the fridge. This (as far as I know) is the first beer I have tried with Magnum hops and it took a few sips to warm up, but when those flavors came through, wow they were good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,buffettfan,4.8,"Poued from 22oz bottle into a glass. First apperance is great! A dark golden amber, with a thick off white head, that seemed to last for ever. Aroma was a spicey hop, slight citrus. Taste was amazing. Lots of hops! I loved it. I had wished I bought me! A very easy drinking IPA. Finished very smooth. THis is amoung my new favorites!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The smell is surprisingly earthy to musty with a hint of soap. The taste is moderately bitter with good hop balance and a medium to long-lived bitter aftertaste. THe mouthfeel is medium bodied with a creamy texture, moderate carbonation and a slightly astringent finish. I was a little surprised by this one. I had high expectations, considering I loved their 10-year, and I really like their IPA. The smell is a little too earthy.

147,4083,Homerbag,4.3,"Poured into an ovesize wine glass, golden with finger thick head. Smells of an IPA, nice floaral, grapefruitlike hops fill the nose. Solid drinking DIPA. It does not have the hop attack that a Midwestern DIPA has, but it hits the back of the tounge with a pleasant grapefruity citruis hop character that is about as good as I've had. Feels good on the palate, everything is proper and it compliments my Asian food that I had on the second filling of the glass. A very good brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,RunawayJim,4.38,"Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a snifter. Beer pours a nice slightly cloudy amber color with about a 2 finger head. Smells of piney, citrusy hops, but it's not overwhelming. Some slight malt scents noticed as well.  Flavor is fantastic. This is a nice smooth very drinkable Double IPA. The taste is mostly of those piney citrus hops, but it's well balanced with the malt sweetness, caramel malts perhaps? The beer is moderately carbonated and doesn't feel heavy like some bigger beers do.  All in all, this is an absolutely wonderful double IPA. It is perhaps the most drinkable double IPA I have had and is now on my favorites list.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,bunnyhustle,3.88,"Poured from bomber into pint glass. Probably could have done with a better glass but that was all that was available. Vibrant golden color, clear, with ""average"" head and good retention. Very impressive lace left behind as the glass goes down. Smell is a bit week in my opinoin. Of course it is of hops but I think that theres almost too much going on here and it really distracts from anything particular. Taste is good. Not as bitter as I expected but strong hops tastes, some malt but mainly the hops. Somewhat bitter aftertaste with a touch of grapefruit, leaves a dry feeling. Good carbonation leaves it light and crisp and pretty drinkable beer. Has a nice kick too it, although while drinking I really didnt notice the alcohol after the bomber you're left with that warm feeling.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,pwoods,4.85,"22oz. Bomber from Party Source poured into a snifter. No dating.  A: Pours a nice hazy apricot that I love so much. 1 1/2 finger froathy head hangs out in the snifter for a bit before dieing down. Only slight patchy lacing.  S: Right when you pop the cap you know you're in for a treat. Big piney hops. Just a little bit of citrus alongside a touch of malt sweetness. Malts only adding sweetness. After a couple sips and further warming, I get some Phenols in the background reminding me to sip.  T/M: Pow, right in the kissuh(lol). I wanted hops and I got 'em. Very bitter with twang of grapefruit. Malts slide in to balance things perfectly. Nice subtle sweetness. Body is closer to a single IPA which I think is perfect for this beer. First sip lets you know this'll be dry and it doesn't come up short.  D: I could drink this brew day and night.

Lots of citrus hops.  MF: Masks the alcohol quite well. Very light and crisp, and a nice grapefruit aftertaste.  O: I do love Stone. The caption on the bottle cracks me up.

I can tell this will be one hell of a hoppy beer! Taste is malty at first and then very citrusy and floral in the middle, towards the back of the throat.This beer feels pretty well-balanced when compared to a few other Imperial IPAs I have had.  There's just enough hoppiness but not enough to overwhelm the palate. The grapefruit/citrus flavor is what I look for in an IIPA and this is no exception.

147,4083,cswhitehorse,4.25,The ruination ipa pours a cloudy orange hued goodness. Cool bottle with a few paragraphs spouting their pride but no freshness date. The smell is very hoppy and aromatic. The taste is strongly bittered which was good. A tad on the alocholic flavor and it was toasty and creamy. In the mouth it danced happy and left a sweet date like flavor.

S-I equate this aroma to sticking my face in a bag of fresh hop pellets. Very piney and resinous. Awesome aroma, but a little different than I have had before. Not picking up a ton of citrus.  T&M-Very crisp and dry from start to finish. Hops are strong throughout and give off a sticky, harsh (but nice harsh) flavor that is complimented wonderfully against the malt bill. Nice biscuit maltiness.  D-I have had some wonderful IIPAs in the past. This is good, but not great in my opinion. It is aggressive, and loaded with flavor.

147,4083,sessycuban,4.7,"I've been drinking Ruination for several years now, but I haven't bothered to review it. Now is as good a time as ever.  A  The beer pours a rich orange. The beer is highly carbonated, but not so much so that you get excessive head. The lacing is wonderful and the beer retains well. This one is an absolute joy to look at even if you have no intention of drinking it.  S  The beer has an intense citric note. This is the foremost aroma. Im also getting pine and floral notes. Again, fun to smell even if you have no intention of drinking the beer.  T  Hops. Ive had my fair share of DIPAs and they all claim to be the hoppiest beer but Ive yet to find a beer as hoppy as Ruination. Although a hopbomb, it is still easy to identify the malt in the brew. In one word, fantastic.  M  The beer is medium bodied. The high level of carbonation is a plus, as I find many DIPAs to taste a bit flat. This is perfect.  D  This is by far the most aggressive beer Ive ever had and likely will ever have. This is both good and bad. In some ways, the beer is extremely drinkable. If youre going to enjoy a DIPA, why not start here? On the other hand, as I said, this is a very aggressive beer, making other Stone offerings look tame in comparison. This, coming from a brewery that has never been reticent to challenge their consumers.  For those who havent experienced, it is well time you should.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Throwrug,4.52,"After reading the bottle, I expected to be knocked out of my chair with bittnerness -- this was not quite the case, but it does have a nice bitter aftertaste.

Very well done!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mrasskicktastic,4.27,"A - A clear copper to amber brew with a huge, unyielding head. Minutes later, it still maintains it's presence. Lacing is scattered in large clumps.  S - Not too surprisingly, it smells like hops. A potent hop aroma of roses and pine makes it's present known with a bit of honey and biscuits underneath.  T - Everything I have ever heard about this beer relates to its alledged delightfully caustic bitterness. Seriously, I have been expecing a brew that would put devil dancer to shame and make me redefine bitterness based on the arrival of the first beer which truly goes to eleven. The reality does not compare to the hype. Maybe, I was misinformed? Of course, it is bitter, but I don't think its bitterness really stands out among other DIPAs. I suppose if there is anything to make you think it was more bitter, it would be the mild foretaste - which is a mild floral flavor with a very lightly sweet malt. I can taste a hint of vanilla too. The resiny bitterness itself is accompanied by a malty flavor with a faint hint of that vanilla still lingering. I am sorry, this is not the delightful bitter juice rumor had promised me - it is just a delicious well rounded IPA.  M - Thin, smooth, refreshing.  D - A nice brew that I will likely have again. I was really looking forward to a bitter beast tonight, I was let down on that end, but I found something nice nonetheless.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The color seems to hint of something special to me--dark yellow with almost a pinkish glow. The smell is hoppy and citrusy.  I'm coming back and editing this one a couple years later, after experiencing a few dozen other IPAs. The taste on this one isn't quite as earth shatteringly good as I remember. The citrus flavor is moderate, but not strong, and the aspirin bitterness on the finish is a bit much. I know, it's all about the bitterness on the label, but this is a bit out of balance for me.

147,4083,errantnight,4.62,"Pours a rich golden hue with a three fingers of rich, creamy head. Decent lacing. Just gorgeous.  The aroma is really where this beer shines, at least when it's fresh. Fresh tropical fruit, pollinating flowers, tangerine and orange... phenomenal.  Taste is malty sweet with a remarkably clean finish. Hop flavors abound, the fruits at the forefront.  Creamy and smooth... just makes you want to reach for it.  I've been drinking this beer for years... and early on it was too bitter, and then for a while it seemed too sweet... and now it seems great. Happily available in 12oz. bottles, it's a regular in my fridge. Not quite as strong and over-the-top as something like Hopsickle, but it's almost unfair to compare it. Although it is rightfully categorized as a double, it bares more similarities to some of the big West Coast IPAs (think Alesmith IPA)... similar to the superb Stone IPA with even more hop presence and enough sweetness to achieve the perfect balance.  For a beer that for a couple years would have come up short for me in comparison to some of the other Stone brews, this is now one of my favorites... coincidence that that happened after I moved to the West Coast and am perhaps imbibing a fresher product?

But alas, Oregon has provided me this delicious elixir at the convenience of my local tavern.  Before reviewing, Ruination is in my top 5 IPA's, and as such, well, it may get somewhat of a biased treatment. Trying to remain as objective as possible, so here it goes...  Pours a illuminating orange copper with good head rentention and sticky (permanant!) lacing. Aroma is of, well, hops! Lots of em. Deep pine and floral citrus. Perfume and a bit of an alcohol kick.  THe hops assail and don't stop. The bitterness comes in after a moment, but isnt in the initial second. At the same time, floral and earthy tones drop in attempting to control the hops, and isntead just compliment and add to the party. Finish is still sharp, but as it fades away, the mouth waters asking for more. Tuely a good IPA.  An end note: this one will dominate your palatte. Your food won't taste the same...Forget about trying to taste any other beers after this one!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,John_M,4.27,"Had this on tap at Max's the other night. Very glad to see this fine brewery finally available in Maryland.  The beer pours a beautiful light orange color with very good head retention and lacing. On the nose this beer is DIPA perfection. One gets an incredible aroma of light pine, sweet orange citrus (almost Tang or orange cool-aide like), and noticeable bitterness. Just unbelievable. On the palate the beer is very good, but doesn't blow my socks off. It's another very good DIPA, with lots of orange citrus and hoppy bitterness. The beer is fairly light on the palate, though you know the alcohol is there. Still, it's not obtrusive, and the beer is not heavy on the finish. Very nice beer from Stone Brewing.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Sveiks,4.23,"The regular Stone IPA might be my favorite beer. It's uniquely strong, flavorful, empowering, goes great with ""man food"", and you drink it in a proper pint glass, not the brandy snifters that are out of control in the beer world these days.  I really like the Ruination IPA, but my problem with it is that for the significant increase in price, it isn't too discernably different than the regular Stone IPA. It tastes great, but I was expecting something more varied than what I got. I'd definitely buy this again, but it would probably be in a situation where I was really craving Stone IPA, but only the Ruination was available...or if I could find some at a more reasonable price ($17.99 for a six-pack at whole foods).  One more note -- the color of the beer is really cool...when in the fridge the light shining through the haziness of the beer and the dark glass foreshadows what's to come once you poor it. Hazy, cloudy, dirty golden...on sight alone you know the taste will be sharp.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

An earthy hoppiness is the brightest smell, with a some floral hints as well.  Huge hops right away, with a slight sweetness that helps to balance. Though this is not a balanced beer and I like it that way. A tounge ripping hoppy bitterness in the aftertaste, perfect way to end a beer.  Very creamy mouthfeel.  I will be buying this beer again. A great tasting beer, not the most drinkable, but I will have no problem finishing this bomber.

147,4083,snpub540,3.8,"By far this is one of my favorite DIPAs out there.  As I poured into into my Ruination pint glass I noticed the golden orange glow that comes forth from this bomber. It was topped of by a 1/4 inch white head. The foam left some very nice thin webs of lacing on the glass.  The smell was all hops, just as it should have been. There were floral notes, as well as citrus notes, and brought all together with some grassy and woody scented hops.  Taste... The bottle puts it as best as it possibly can be described. ""A liquid poem to the glory of the hop."" Love those creative minds over there at Stone. Yes, this is a very bitter beer and just how I like it. Don't get me wrong but there is some malt presence in the very beginning, but it is quickly washed away by grapefruit and pine flavored hops. The finish is dry with a light alcohol finish.  A staple in my fridge, I love this beer. Drinkability is a little on the low side, because it is pretty aggressive. I would recommend this beer for any one who is a hophead like myself, definately not the beer to convert a BMC kind of crowd.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,maddogruss,3.9,"I reviewed this beer about a year ago. But my palate has become much more learned in styles since then that this beer tasted completely different the second time around.

T: When I first had it, seemed like a hop bomb. After having many IPAs, DIPAs, Imperials, and so on, I was able to note that, while this beer was hoppy, there were nice, subtle malts that made it smooth drinking and kind of a sweet aftertaste. Definitely seemed like a while new beer.  M: A nice, full-bodied mouthfeel.  D: While the malts were more evident this time around, there was still a decent amount of hops in it. I woke up the next day with my stomach churning. The fact that there is a high IBU balance here as well as a decent ABV, you cannot pound these back. However, you might be able to hang out and sip a few, but that's about it. Eventually, the high IBU will catch up to you and you will regret it afterwards.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Grundle20,4.62,"Appearance: The beers kind of glows tangerine in the light, it's a very brightly colored beer. There's a respectable white head to top it off and despite some weak retention, plenty of wispy lacing coats the glass and skates the surface of the beer.  Smell: Hey guess what, this beer smells like hops! All jokes aside this smell is perfection. The perfect balance of good citric hop aroma and caramel malt sweetness with just a touch of piney resin in the back. Delicious.  Taste and Mouthfeel: Again the balance is great but it's a little heavy on hop bitterness. The beer greets me with a good sweet orange character up front which grows in dry stinging bitterness exponentially as the flavor of mild caramel malts unfolds. The finish is that of citrus rind and it hangs on in to the aftertaste carrying with it just a hint of sweetness.  Drinkability: The beer is good and it hides its ABV well which is really its only detractor from being a perfect drinking beer. Great taste but it will creep up on you.  Bottom Line: One of the few hype worthy beers in my opinion. I feel it was a very wise decision of Stone to put this in to 6 packs since it just seems like a shame having so many of the great beers of the world tied up in bottles that leave you weighing how bombed you want to get before diving in.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,doppelmeup,4.43,"I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. I was expecting a beer so over-hopped that it would be nearly undrinkable. However, this was not the case.  Poured like liquid sunshine into a pint glass, with a half inch head of sticky lace that hung around all the way down.  Wonderful fruity hoppiness, with a slighlty sweet aspect as well.  Taste is bitter, fruity hops, but it does a slight sweetness that lends some balance. Make no mistake, it is very hoppy, but not too the point you couldn't drink it.  Leave a clean, crisp mouthfeel with some lingering stickiness from the hops.  Overall, this is a very easy drinking IPA, although the ABV could easily sneak up on you.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S:The malt up front is actually more prevalent that I expected, but its quickly subsumed under the hops; citrus, grass, some boozey spice. T: A nice sweet/bitter balance up front, giving way to a very cirtus/grassy hop character. M: Pretty average, less thick that I had anticipated. D: I think this one falls somewhere in between an IPA and a DIPA. Its definitely aggressive, but just not as aggressive as a single IPA. Its a good choice for those times when you want something with a bit more character than your standard IPA but you just dont feel like taking on an 11% monster. A great brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,domtronzero,4.32,"Wow! I never thought this beer could be so HUGE! This is probably one of the most complex DIPAs I've ever had. This is my wife's favorite beer.  Pours a crystal clear, bright orange/amber with a one-finger tightly packed white head. Lacing left all over the tulip glass (my wife prefers it out of a pint glass, but she's a novice - haha). Aroma is heavily that of citrusy/piney herbal hop aromas with a slight floral note powering through. Taste is overwhelmingly bitter hops, grapefruit and resinous pine notes, with a strong hoppy spice. Although it is strongly hopped, it is balanced well with toasted malt flavors and a slight caramel flavor. Definite alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is rather thick and slick, but the carbonation makes it tingly and easy drinking. Only the alcohol strength keeps me from quaffing this beer throughout the night, as I usually end up passed-out after three 22 oz. bottles, which is a good thing because otherwise it ends up being an expensive night of drinking.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,RedChrome,4.32,An bright clear golden colored beer. Thick white head was an inch high and shrunk slowly. Slow rising carbonation was a decent quantity. Thick sheet of lacing around the glass.  Very crisp light citric scent to the hops aroma. The scent rises to the nose even when the glass is away from you. Very minor alcohol note. Buttery caramel malt scent is also well hidden.  Bitter citrus mainly tangerine. Gritty hops leaf flavors show an immense amount of fragility. Flavors shift and go from slight sweet to mainly bitter before ending up nicely balanced.  A bit of a watery feeling when compared to the lacing stickiness. Carbonation bursts in shifts on the tongue.  A very good beer overall. Pair this with a cheddar burger. A nice job from the folks at Stone for a balanced beer in an all too often overpowering style.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ncvbc,4.47,"A fluffy white head when poured with some sticky lacing. Steady and solid carbonation throughout and a honey golden color.  Big juicy citrus hops and a slightly sweet malt backbone. I got a huge whiff of hops when I opened the bottle. Tempting scent to say the least.  Taste is at first of citrus hops. Mainly grapefruit and orange, sugared with malt sweetness. Caramel malts followed by a piney hop bite to finish. This is your basic taste for the style except all aspects of it are near perfection...  A sticky and resinous mouthfeel that can be numbing at times. Somewhat bitter and tingles the tongue.  Superb drinkability. A well-built double with hops dominating for sure but balanced wonderfully by malts. This beer does a good job of having a low ABV for its style while packing the same punch as those with more potent content. I can't get enough.

Incredible flavor, with real clean pour and nice thin head. Beautiful Beer!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,bboven,4.59,"Deep golden color with great lacing and a head that stays until the end.  Smells of lots of fruity hops and a little bit of warm alcohol ester.  Very hoppy, but sweet and just overpowering enough. The malt is certainly there, but it's the hops' show.  Very filling mouthfeel, great carbonation.  Goes down ridiculously smooth and quickly if you're a hophead. It's just too damn tasty to sip slowly even though it should be because of the relatively high ABV.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,younger35,4.6,"Drank from a pint glass. As usual a pretty cool bottle with a nice little story about the beer on back. A liquid poem to the glory of the hop!  Appearance- Pours a nice golden orange with a rather large fluffy head that seems to never actually recede. Leaves an awesome thick lacing down the side of the glass as the huge cap slowly reaches the bottom of my cup. Smell- Lots of resiny, piney hops that almost seem to jump out of the glass. Very citrusy and vibrant also with hints of lemon, orange and basically any other aromatic citrus. Subtle sweet malt lingers in the background trying to add balance but is just overpowered by the hops. Taste- Lots of orange, grapefruit, lemon zestyness that just seem to explode in the mouth. So vibrant and bitter yet still maintains a very nice balance as some sweet malt makes its way in. Finishes oh so bitter but not over the top. Just enough to tickle the side of my tongue and let me know the hops are still there. Insanely balanced for 100+ IBUs. Mouthfeel- Very thick and almost syrupy. Surprising syrupy and thick for only 7.7 ABV. Light, small carbonation. Drinkability- Ok I havent been the biggest Stone supporter in the past. I always thought they made pretty tasty beers, but not really great beers. The more Ive been drinking them lately, the more Im starting to change my mind. This beer gets better and better every time I drink it. Highly recommended. Probably the most balanced big IPA Ive had. Great job Stone!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,tpd975,4.5,"Man was it good to be in Indiana where I could get my hands on an unlimited amount of Stone brews. This is one of my favorites so I decided to finally give it a review.  A: Pours a golden orange color with a thunderous white foamy head. The bubbles continually rise to the top like a filter in a fish tank. As the contents disappear beautiful lacing is left behind. Lovely Brew!  S: Ahhh what an aroma. I feel like I am in a Pine forest. There is a huge aroma of pine sap as it oozes from the tree. But Wait! This pine forest must be in Florida. There is a wonderful orange peel aroma as well, aaahhh fresh squeezed Florida sweet orange juice. Masterpiece!  T: This is where this one knocks your socks off. POW! Holy Mackerel Batman this is one awesome brew. Huge hop aromas right from the get go. Pine sap, and citrus assault your senses. Hops baby, this one shows off the IBU's. Man oh Man I haven't even mentioned the malty sweetness. One of the best beers in America bar none!  M: Full bodied yet syrupy. It actually has a slightly heavy quality to it. Flows like a thin buttery sweet maple syrup. God I love this brew!  D: F@*k Yeah! Bomber after bomber baby until I pass out or puke, who knows what will come first.  Overall: I love Stone. They are aggressive brewers who make some of the best brews around. No doubt this is one of their best. I cut my craft brew teeth on Arrogant Bastard which will always have a place in my heart, but pound for pound this is the best of the bunch when it comes to the Stone's Hoppy Brews!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,marksto,4.29,"Pours medium golden in color with hints of orange, and a thin head that falls fairly quickly. Aroma is all hops - resinous, citrusy, and melon; very nice. Flavor is again dominated by hops, very juicy and fruity, with hints of apricot. Bitterness is present but well balanced with hop flavor and malt sweetness.  A very good IPA from a brewery noted for the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BattleRoadBrewer,4.22,"Served at fridge temp from a silkscreened amber 12 oz into Boston Lager glass.  Pours vivid orange-amber, with a fluffy tan head leaving plenty of lacing.  Nose is huge with resiny, pungent hops. A sliver of maltiness sneaks out as it warms.  Flavor is dominated by the hops. Unbalanced in favor of the hops, great for a hop head who finds barleywines too big. Mega bitterness just as the name implies. Very nice.  Mouthfeel and drinkability are great. This is a strong bitter beer that rewards the palate.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Poser,4.4,"My first Ruination -- great beer! Pours a slightly orangy red color with thick top and some of the best lacing I've ever seen. Aroma is spicy citrus with some strong hops. Taste and mouthfeel is exceptional and complex. There is definitely some citrus tones but also some very sweet malts. The hoppy bitterness, however, will soon dominate the palate. I recommend not drinking anything after this brew as your tastebuds will be fried. Medium-bodied but the texture dominates going down.  I will be stocking up on this exception brew next time I'm out of state.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S: A sharp and resinous grapefruit hop aroma. Sweet caramel malt aroma add balance. Alcohol aroma also adds character - of booze.  T: Very puckering hop flavor dominates. Hop character is intensely grapefruit. Some other fruity notes (melon) are also noticeable. Malt flavor provides background support. No alcohol flavor. Malt flavor is sweet - almost sugary.  MF: Light for a double IPA. Well carbonated adds to a filling mouthfeel. Alcohol is well masked - no warming.  D/notes: A double IPA that sets itself apart from its higher level competition due to light mouthfeel, sugary sweet malt, and relatively clean and non-dry finish.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Tangerine hops come in the middle supported by a caramel sweetness from the malt. Third to come is a perfumy hop flavor. Big bitter finish that lingers quite a long time.  M-medium body, even carbonation. Hop oils are prevalent and coat the mouth.  D-This is quite drinkable.

Will have to drink another pint to be sure...  M. Excellent. Dry, smooth, and finishes bittersweet. Not harsh at all, which is appreciated.  D: Good for the style. Not unlike Stone IPA on juice.

This time I am not sure I taste that but I do taste a very perfume, floral, and extremely bitter taste. The smell reminds me of Stone IPA, no surprise there. The bitter aftertaste is strong with this one but in a good way. Appearance is yellow with a perfect white head filling the top two inches of the mug. There is a little astringency in the mouthfeel. This beer was nice to revisit. This really is ruinous to the palate, thanks Stone!  Update 3/15/14  Nice grapefruit aroma and flavor. Nice IPA, just wish it had some pine or dank.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,MiguelMandingo,4.5,"I had been waiting to try this one for a long time. It was worth the wait. Big thanks to ""Once Upon a Vine"" in Richmond, VA for supplying me with some bottles.  Poured part of a Bomber into a tulip glass.  Appearance - it has a 2 finger frothy head, and is a golden transparent caramel color. Left tons of lacing.  Smell - It smells of hops, and a lot of it. Notes of citrus grapefruit, and pine. It has an underlying caramel malt smell as well. Very balanced.  Taste - It tastes just like it smells. Tons of hops in front with a nice caramel malt background. It is far more balanced than Stone's original IPA. Alcohol is almost completely absent from the flavor.  Mouthfeel - Near perfect level of carbonation. Goes down crisp and smooth.  Drinkability - Incredible. It would be very easy to drink many more of these if I had access to them.  I don't know what else to say. This is one of the best DIPAs I have ever had. It is a shame that these aren't sold in Texas. It was worth the wait, and it was worth the search.

147,4083,ommegangpbr,4.49,"Ruination in 6 packs of 12 ounce bottles... what a fine idea. Seems pricey at around the $15 range for a 6 pack, but considering that it costs $4-6 per bomber, the price is reasonable. I'm sure the cost of the hops that go into this guy is considerable. This review would be for one of them bottles. Loooks... like a beer. Not as deep in color as I recall; resembles sparkling cider. Offwhite head that intends to stay for quite some time leaving rings of lace as it reluctantly recedes. The scent is killer. Nearly knocks you off your feet then pummels you into the ground. Sharp, spicy and floral with a suggestion of malts underneath. Flavors are pretty in your face with them there hops. The malts are almost like a slender young woman trying not to be dragged down the street by her 150 pound rottweiler. Layers of hop flavor doing different kinds of magic. Mouthfeel manages to stay restrained. Bitterness is there but it's not ugly. Layers of texture are interesting and enjoyable. While I'm not about to guzzle gallons of this stuff I always mean to seek it out again and again. A 12 ounce serving can be plenty but that doesn't mean you don't want to consume more.

Just enough to let me know that I'm in for a full bodied heartfelt beer! The nose made the smile on my face even bigger. Very nice citricy hop aroma. I may have even picked up on a bit of carmely maltness as well. The taste was great. Full bodied. Great balance between the bitterness and sweetness... which is normally where i find fault in IPA's.

147,4083,onthefarside,4.87,"Holy crap where do I start with this beer. Picked it up at Oliver's Beverage, the best place to buy beer in upstate NY. I took it out of the fridge for about 15-20 minutes for it to warm up and then poured it into a pint glass. I saw a delightful amber/apricot colour with a respectable head for an IPA, let alone a DIPA, which at only 7.4 i find hard to really consider a double. However it left good lacing on my glass and smelled absolutely delicious. When Stone says ruination they mean it. It totally dominates every sense. the smell is of a beautiful hop medley and makes my mouth water. Taste wise, at first the bitter of hops attacks the tounge, followed by a bit of a sweet malty taste, then more hops and long after it is swallowed you can feel the hops lingering. mouthfeel is perfect, although i love it, i find dogfish head 90 minute to be rather thick where this is perfect, not too watery. swishing around on the tounge is pleasurable. Finally drinkability, despite being 7.7% abv, you cannot taste the alcohol AT ALL, wether this is due to the hops or a tasty malt, I do not know, but if you drink a bomber of this you probably will feel it. Be careful with this one!  Overall this is a great beer, a little pricey but that's what BA high reviews do.

Having just poured it, I was required to answer the doorbell, then returned to find a whisp of thin, white cloud suspended in the middle of the glass with a few bubbles like tiny eyes peaking up at me. At arms length, this was a hazy, blurry amber/gold with a hint of apricot in appearance. Upon closer examination, however, there was a healthy, energetic multitude of tiny bubbles rapidly moving upwards - more than in some sparkling wines I've known!  Ahhh, an aroma of hops abounds with a full hoppy taste, I feel like I'm swishing a mouthful of fire. The finish is long and drawn out, a pronounced bitterness that envelopes to the top of the throat and doesn't want to quit. Tell me, why isn't every IPA made like this? I forgot, I live in Ontario! With a quarter glass left after some 30 minutes, a second pour from what remains in the one pint, six fluid ounce bottle produces a generous, cream-coloured frothy head with plenty of carbonation continuing.  It's at this point that I stop to admire the bottle and read the wordy label. I find Stone Breweries true to their word: this is one hoppy IPA as the assault continues to delight and satisfy.

Hops and sweet malt are surprisingly balanced for a DIPA, with a good amount of grapefruit tossed in as well. Body is medium to full, with good carbonation. This one is fairly surprising for a DIPA. I'd almost expect it to be a second IPA, because, while not particularly hoppier than the Stone IPA, it has a quite different flavor (lacking in some of the sourness?). Because of this, I think it'd be a perfect beer to introduce people to DIPAs. It also makes it much more drinkable than a lot of DIPAs.

I didn't have the glass within 6 inches of my nose and I caught the citrus-y, flowery smell.  T: Good god... This must be what heaven is like. If I die tomorrow I'm glad I tried this beer.

147,4083,warmstorage,4.02,"22 ounce bottle, $3.99 (on sale) at Brown Jug Warehouse in Anchorage, AK.  Visual: pours a deep gold, lots of visible carbonation present. Light, white head moderately dense. Minimal lacing.  Aroma: Perfume-y and piney hops, slightly sweet hops, minimal malt.  Taste: perfume and pine and resin and slightly spicy hops, hints of orange/tangerine. Nice hop bodied.  Mouth: slightly slick and moderately full, little of the heat one might expect from a 7.7% ABV beer.  I like Ruination: a lot. So don't get me wrong when I say that I think it's a seriously overhyped beer, and that it's silly to consider it an excelletn example of DIPA as a style. It's an OUTSTANDING West Coast style American IPA. As a DIPA, it would be a little lacking in hop blast and alcohol presence. It's way to easy to drink, and lacking hops, and power, and sheer strength, for me to put it into the same category as Pliny (especially Younger but also Elder), Exponential Hoppiness, Great Divide Hercules, Bristol DIPA, Moylander, or even Stone 10th, which I consider benchmarks of the style.  I actually slightly prefer the pronounced hops in Stone IPA, but Ruination is a really nice diversion now and then.  As an aside on pricing, cult following, and perceived scarcity/value: the same Brown Jug that is charging $3.99 a bomber for this on sale is charging the indefensible price of $15.99 for a six pack of 12 ounce bottles. (Yet only $9.99 for a sixer of Stone IPA.) Do I really think they are paying 60% more for Ruination than IPA? Not for a second. They just know they can get a shitload for Ruination, so they do.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,TheBierBand,4.23,"Poured from the 22 oz. bomber into an oversized wine glass to form a nice 1/2"" head of a dense beige foam. The beer is honey colored and a touch cloudy. The lacing is nice and clumpy.  The scent is subdued citrusy hops.  OK.... after all the hype.... and the intimidation of reading the bottle....here goes.... the taste... NICE!.... I'm still here.... and very much alive.... as are my tastebuds.... This is a fine example of an American DIPA!... Great hops.... more citrusy than piney.... but I can taste BOTH. But that's not the end of it.... there is also a nice malt balance in the background. Hey, wait a minute.... there's also a hint of earthy woodsy flavor.  The mouthfeel is just a tiny bit too fizzy for my taste. IMO could be slightly less on the carbonation.... not much.... perhaps 10% less.... then it'd be perfect...(IMO). Perhaps even a harder pour would take care of that. (and, as I poured the remainder of the bomber in my 12 oz. oversized wine glass... I tested this theory by pouring from a steeper angle.... this dissipated the carbonation into more head.... and essentially fixed the carbonation issue for me). Still, this ale provides a nice mouth coating and aftertaste.  Drinkability.... Still quite good.... This is a very good example of the style (ADIPA). You're not going to chug back 3 or 4 of these bombers in an afternoon.... but 2 wouldn't be out of the question.... to satisfy your inner Hop Head. The Bier Band highly recommends Stone Ruination IPA for the serious hop enthusiast. BMC Lovers... stay away!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,bigman147,4.44,"Appearance: Pale straw color, slightly hazy in the glass with an even white head that gives way to some sticky resiny lacing on the glass.  Aroma: Fresh cut hops, very piney/grapefruity resiny hops. Lots of hops. A hint of alcohol on the nose and a slight malt sweetness. Very juicy aroma.  Taste: Mouth watering juicy hops. Well balanced combination of alcohol, malts and hop bitterness. A bready yeasty character that hides behind the citrusy sweet finish. Bitterness is strong but not as strong or unbalanced as most IIPA.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation is medium. Body is somewhat full with a good amount of malt sweetness. Slightly drying with the hop flavor.  Drinkability: This is a very tasty and flavorful beer. A perfect everyday drinking Double IPA. The alcohol is probably one of the big detractor for drinking alot of this.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,kcillini77,4.74,"As good as expected. Brought this back with me from a trip to CA and saved it for a lazy Sunday evening.

Heaven in a bottle (or, actually, a Duvel glass).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,WillieMoe,4.58,"This is a hophead's dream. It pours a beautiful amber color and gives off a subtle hop smell. This is a delicious IPA, maybe the best I've ever had. It has a great balance about it's flavor. Not too bitter, and doesn't have a strong aftertaste. This is very drinkable, and recommended for any hophead out there.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Risser09,4.85,"12 Oz Bottle Poured Into A Wine Glass  Appearance: Golden orange with a cakey white head. The head flows up to and inch and is slowly dissapating. The beer itself is a bit cloudy and has bubbles fleeting to the top of the beer.  Smell: Hop flowers, grapefruit (and plenty of it). Alcohol, seashells, and roses.  Taste: Wow. A pleasant mix of pine and grapefruit, with maybe a little more grapefruit. I like the balance of the two together. Other tastes include strawberry and some honeysuckle. I am giving this beer a 5 for taste because of the complexity and balance. It's not completely mindblowing, but the flavor is full and strong, is nicely floral and hasn't weakened throughout the beer. Well Done.  Mouthfeel: Another 5. Very creamy upfront and all the way to the end. A bittering finish in the throat is all you ask for when it comes to the strong hop flavor. The subtle carbonation lets me focus on the sweet smell and flavor. Alcohol is present but not overwhelming.  Drinkability: Awesome. Probably one of my favorite DIPAs at this point. Low on the ABV and high in flavor, aroma, and mouthfeel. I could and would drink plenty of these in one night. To me this is up there with Double Simcoe, with better taste but not better aroma. One of the top 3 DIPAs I have ever had. Bravo.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,TexIndy,3.98,"Poured from a 650ml bottle with no dating info into my trusty pint glass. It was opaque orangish color kinda like a dark butterscotch. It had a smaller head that I expected but still decent. Good lacing. The aroma was of course insane hops - more citrusy than floral. Was a combination of smells but one of them I definitely didn't like so hurt the score a bit. The taste had the same problem. Starts off really good but has this weird aftertaste. Not sure but what it is but don't like it. Fortunately, it's not dominant enough to ruin the whole experience. Mouthfeel is good with nice hop attack. Overall, it's a good beer but that weird smell/taste keeps it out of the top ADIPA's for me. Need to try again to make sure a good sample but the review is for this bottle.

147,4083,CWiggins,4.17,"This is the first offering by Stone to pass my lips, because we can't get their products in North Carolina. I picked this upalong with Vertical Epic (7/7/7) and Old Guardianat Grape & Gourmet in Virginia Beach during a recent visit. Based on previously read reviews on this site and others, it seemed I couldn't pass any of their brews up if I encountered them!  I eagerly anticipated the taste of this ale while pouring it into a Dogfish Head ergonomic pint glass. It certainly looks like an IPA: the hazy orange color and the nearly white head attest to that. Speaking of the head, it seemed as though it was never going to subside. The aroma is a bit fruity, with apricots dominating, while the unmistakeable fragrance of piney hops wafts upward to the nose. It has a very clean, almost sterile scent overall. Now, the flavor: floral and hops with hints of grapefruit, especially while cold. As it warms, the beer develops less citrus fruit and more floral overtones. The finish is truly hoppy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,coalcracker,4.47,"Appearance: Pours a pale golden color with just a bit of head. Smell: I swear I smelled the hops just a moment after opening the bottle. Spicy, acidic to a small degree. Taste: A hop attack- but so smooth and balanced. Has that initial bite- though not enough to leave you wincing. The spicy and citrusy taste lingers on the palate for a while. Well done! Mouthfeel: Smooth but heavy on the tongue. Not a great deal of that hoppy oil texture. Drinkability: Deceiving ABV. Delicious- yet personally I usually hold myself to no more than 2 IPAs in one session. It would NOT be difficult to order a second Ruination.  Overall: Rates with HopDevil and DFH 90 as my favorite IPAs. Awesome...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,umustdrink,4.03,"Thanks to MiScusi for an excellent trade.  A - Hazy opaque orange color. Rocky white head fades to a film, with thick patches in the center and around the edges. Lots of lacing here.  S - Smell is extremely hoppy; fruity, intense, felt in the sinuses. Faint malty balance, but mostly the smell is intense hops.  T/M - The taste starts out thin and slightly bitter with a hoppy carbonation bite. Then grapefruit-like hops, not nearly as extreme as the smell would suggest. Just a little alcohol is detectable. Finish is a bit thin, bittery and hoppy, as expected.  D - Overall, this is a typical run-of-the-mill Double IPA, nothing exceptionally special about it.

Aroma is of rich hops with a definite fruitiness.  Flavor is very full and complex. The hops are intense to be sure, but in no way harsh, and meld excellently with subtle accents of fruit, freshly cut wood, and wisps of alcohol. Very smooth malts.

147,4083,khiasmus,4.82,"A- Clear orange with two fingers of head that lingers as a film for the entire experience. Leaves minimal lacing. Looking at this beer makes you anxious to taste it.  S- Smelling this beer makes you desperate to taste it. One of the best smelling beers I've ever had. Rich, thick, sweet caramel maltiness, with hints of biscuits, sugar cookies, and cane sugar in there. The hops balance perfectly, with resiny, acidic notes. Wow.  T- There's the caramel I just smelled... mmm. Caramel, maple, honey, sweet bread. Then the piney, citric hops come in to balance and eventually override. Finish is very hoppy, but the sweetness lingers as well. Wonderful. Wish i hadn't split the bomber with kkipple.  M- Smooth, thick, chewy, full-bodied. Medium carbonation, and a quite astringent finish.  D- It's wonderful. There are very, very few IPA's that can do this to me... I was sitting here grinning from ear to ear and just savoring.

147,4083,YonderWanderer,4.8,"Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a pint glass.  One of the finest IPAs I've had, and by far one of my favorite beers. The regular Stone IPA is quite tasty, but this kicks it up an even further notch. It manages to be strong and ridiculously hoppy without introducing too much sweetness as some other stronger IPAs tend to do.  The aroma is citrusy, with a strong hop character. Very pleasing to the nose. Pours a dark golden color with a decent head of foam.  The taste and mouthfeel is where this beer really shines though. The taste is pure hops, with enough malt flavor to give the necessary balance to it, and to help subdue any over-the-top alcohol flavor that might come through. But still, the key here is the hops. The flavor is bitter, with citrus overtones. Mouthfeel is good, not too watery, nice and crisp all the way through.  Drinkability for me on this one is very high. I find them to be excellent either chilled out of the fridge or at room temperature. Either way is good, and brings out different characteristics of the beer. Since a full bomber can't fit in a pint glass, I frequently find myself starting with it chilled, and by the time I get pouring the second half, it's warmed up.  I can't say enough about the Ruination and Stone in general - this is a highly recommended beer. Since I got into their beers, I've been highly impressed by everything. Now if only they were easier to get on the east coast!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Looks golden/copper in colour. Average sized white head. Head retention is not so great, but it leaves some lace.  Taste is piney, and spicy. There is some of the citrusy grapefruit flavours there that I had smelled, but they are taking back-seat to the pine, floral, and spicy hops. There is a touch of sweetness that reminds me of watermelon flavoured candy.  Mouthfeel is between medium & light bodied, but closer to medium. It's kind of spritzy & fizzy.

147,4083,btcook007,4.05,"I tasted this IPA alongside 4 others. I scored it 3rd out of 5 as follows: Bear Republic Racer 5 IPA (1); Port Brewing Wipeout IPA (2); Stone (3, but a virtual tie with Port Wipeout); Sam Smith's IPA (4) Ska Decadent Imperial IPA (5).  Why would Stone Ruination only place 3rd???!!!  Mainly due to a weird flavor in the midtaste.  No other review has identified anything about this, so let me say that it could easily be just me, or the bottle I had. But there was something kind of weird or funky in the midtaste that I just kept on hitting. Maybe it was an apricot flavor that I just wasn't ready for.  I think it may have been an attempt by the brewer to ""balance"" the huge (and wonderful) hoppiness with a like degree of maltiness in the midtaste that did not turn out right for my palate.  A: This had the biggest head of all the 5 beers. Beautiful. Also it had the lightest color of the 5.  S: HUGE SMELL! Very hoppy with pine plus tangerine and clementine oranges  T: Wonderful piney, citrus hops but the mid-flavor of apricots that just didn't work for me  M: Very nice  D: Maybe more of a ""taster's"" beer than a daily drinker?",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

T: Very good, grapefruit and pine upfront, balanced by delicious bready malt and alcohol, yum's the word.  M: Outstanding, deliciously creamy, thick, rich for an IPA.  D: Great, you wouldn't know it's a big beer. I remember first having this after buying a bottle at the Lee Vining Mobil on the U.S. 395 and CA - 120 crossing, attracted to the label, thinking it was some kind of local speciality, at this point knowing almost nothing about beer. It blew me away with an enormous, full bitterness, the likes of which I had never tasted. Now that I am more adept at tasting and drinking IPAs, and 2IPAs, I get a lot more nuance and character that wasn't there before.

147,4083,Monkeyknife,4.45,"Poured from the bottle a deep clear gold with a frothy head. Generous lacing abounds.  The aroma is hops and more hops. Grapefruit and pine dominate yet there is the sweet malty presence that balances it.  The hops literally step up and smack you in the face. Deliciously bitter and sharp to the tongue. It let's you know that you're alive.  Medium bodied and lightly carbonated.  I'm a freak for the hoppy brews, so of course I love this one.

Tastes like you would expect, nicely bittered, but not too much, it remains a very drinkable, suprisingly balenced brew.

The guy who recommended is a coworker and he told me to smell before drinking as this will get rid of the bitterness typically associated with IPAs. He told me I would smell flowers and feel like I was standing on top of a mountain, and I gotta say he's right. This beer smells of a wide open meadow with wild flowers, and the taste is just as you would expect. This is a good beer that will get me to try more IPAs.

147,4083,Glazed144,4.18,"HOPS! Ive never got such a huge whiff of hops as when I opened the bottle, it shot out into my nose. Pouring the beer the aroma was pure hops, might as well have thrown the flowers into a glass. The color was very nice, and a very nice head that it kept somewhat. Crazy lacing going on. The first taste threw me for a loop, damn that was a lot of hops. It definitely had that ruinous affect on my palate. I adjusted to the hoppiness at it became remarkably smooth from there, albeit still a blinding level of hops. Really smooth beer too, no alcohol burn, not too much carbonation, very smooth. I wasnt able to appreciate the malty undertones much though... Im guessing in large part simply due to my inexperience. The only thing preventing me from giving a better rating is that I cant see much more to this beer than crazy amounts of hops (which is not a bad thing by any means, but I want to save my top ratings for a more complex brew).

S- Some sweet malt. A massive dose vegetable-like hops. Some pine. Hints of fruit like apricot. Complex for sure.  T- Very sweet malt up front and then a nice bitter kick in the teeth. There is a definite apricot and pine combo going on in this. Not as thin and one dimensional as lead to believe. Still, this would freak out any person who winces at your run of the mill pale ale. Complex, I'm diggin' this.  M- Seems to have more body to it than Stone's regular IPA. The carbonation is not as crazy in the mouth as the head size would lead you to believe. It is a tad dry and cloying though, but I wouldn't think of going to a beer called ""Ruination"" for a thirst quencher.  D- Pretty damn drinkable for what it is.

147,4083,MiScusi,4.43,"When I first had Ruination from a 22oz bottle I wasn't too thrilled with it compared to most others that try it. Perhaps the bottle was a bit old and the hops had faded or something, but the version on tap was one of the best DIPA's I have had. I finally tasted what everyone had been talking about when they said it has huge hop flavor and aroma, because my bottle didn't feel like that. The thing I also liked most about Ruination was the incredible mouthfeel. It's just *slightly* more viscous than a good IPA, but it's not syrupy and cloyingly sweet like a lot of other DIPA's. I would seek it out on tap rather than the bottle in the future. ___ 01-27-2007 overall: 3.7 appearance: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | mouthfeel: 4.5 | drinkability: 3.5  This 22oz bottle was purchased ~2.5-3 months ago, but has been kept in good condition and I think it's relatively fresh.  A- Appearance is very hazy golden, a glowing golden-orange. The head was thin, but made of fine super-white bubbles, that left pretty good lacing.  S- Very syrupy sweet hops. Lots of super sweetness coming out from the malt too. Not a whole lot of floral aromatic character that I usually get from Stone.  T- Lots going on in the taste. It's a war between the thick malt and the hops. There is definitely a lingering bitterness, although less so than the arrogant bastard. Where you get the hops mostly in this beer is not during the sip, but 5-10 seconds after.  M- Pretty good mouthfeel, what is expected for a DIPA. Light syrupy thick and smooth on the tongue.  A nice DIPA, but I think I enjoyed Elder more. Personally, I would like to see this one tilted just a tad more towards the hops (ironic to say that about Stone huh?... But then again, this bottle was purchased 3 months ago so I don't know if that had a major effect). I would still have this again.

147,4083,BDTyre,4,"I won't say I'm disappointed, but I certainly expected something a bit more...powerful.  This is very enjoyable, but perhaps a little weak to be a DIPA compared to some more recent releases.  Medium amber colour with a foamy white head. Rich malty smell with a fresh, citrusy hop zest.  Zesty, hoppy taste. Grassy, citrus notes. Malty backgrounds, but fairly generic in the malt department.  Overall a good beer, but by today's standards this is a fairly generic, underpowered DIPA. Its ""lightness"" compared to other DIPAs makes this considerably more drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Smell is a fairly aggressive pine & grapefruit that cranks up the anticipation.  Medium bodied, the mouth feel is adequately carbonated with a slighty less than balanced malt character. Not as full and complex as i had anticipated.  The flavor is quite like the nose; a bitter hoppiness of pine. Less of a sweet malt then was in the nose. Lingering bitterness in the finish.  Drinkability - A good drinker, but not measuring up to the hype. This is my third attempt. Tried two other 22oz servings and my perception hasn't changed much.

M- Medium carbonation. I want to call it an oily mouthfeel. It was smooth, but very present.  D- It was very drinkable for the high IBUs. Normally it takes a higher ABV to mask the hops, but Ruination seemed to balance the hop bite with malts. A pleasant surprise.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,dbalsock,3.8,"App: What a lovely golden color this has, with orange hues and a great white head. The carbonation is great and the head neatly laces the sides of the glass, despite disappearing fairly quickly.  Smell: The malt base mixes with alcohol to underscore a sharp hoppiness... not so citrusy, but more piney and fresh smelling. Very nice aroma, like a fine fragrance. It also smells a little bit like the stone brewery itself... incredibly fresh.  Taste: The hops are very powerful in this beer, and lack a balance with the malt base. It definitely hits the spot, you know... the one in the mouth that only wants to suck on fresh juicy hops... yeah, the hop spot... it's quite piney, and lacks the citrus action of a lot of west coast hop bombs, but presents a the more floral and earthy side of hops.  Mouthfeel: Very bitter... more bitter than I was expecting, and I was expecting extremely bitter. It makes you pucker up and dries out your tongue. Definitely a beer to end a session rather than to begin one.  Drinkability: Because of the abrasive nature of this brew, it is not very drinkable and does not lend itself to excessive consumption.

147,4083,Damian,4.21,"Drank from a 12 fl. oz. bottle purchased at Julio's Liquors, Westboro, MA  Poured a hazy, golden amber with a no head but a touch of white froth.  The aroma was intensely rich and hoppy, yet well balanced. Citrusy, cascade hops dominated but were well matched by the sweet, toffee-like maltiness. As the beer warmed, some flowery hop aromas came out, along with ripe tropical fruits.  The taste was initially balanced on the front end but showed its hop prowess on the finish. A mix of hops and semi-sweet malty creaminess came through up front. Citrus was noticeable mid-palate. Piny, resiny, grapefruit-like hops appeared on the back end and they crescendoed into the huge, lingering, alcohol-rich, slightly dry and bitter finish. As intense as the finish was, it did not overwhelm. A slight alcohol warming was noticeable in the throat.  The mouthfeel was creamy and fluffy with an underlying graininess.  For a 100+ IBU double IPA, I found this beer to be much more balanced and drinkable than I anticipated. My only problem with it was that the alcohol seemed rather hot (and it became even stronger as the beer warmed) for only 7.7% ABV.  Overall, this was a tasty brew that would pair well with grilled meats and veggies.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Atlas1,3.75,"I know, I know... I'm not worthy, and all that other Stone stuff. So let's get down to business, shall we.  Pours a good looking golden amber color with a big sparkly two-finger head that settles down a bit in time but leaves some sticky-looking lace in its wake. Smells hoppy, with a very floral piney/grapefruit aroma. More pine than citrusy here, but a very pleasant scent for sure. Hmmm... a big hoppy taste, but not quite what I was expecting. I mean, yes it's big and yes it's bursting with all sorts of hop goodness, but it doesn't really seem all that complex to me. The hops are almost overdone a bit, and what little malt character is present doesn't seem to balance things out very well at all. Sure, it's a tasty brew, if you like hops, but it doesn't add much to the whole double IPA movement sweeping the American landscape beyond being big and hoppy. Sturdy, almost creamy (but dry) mouthfeel. A drinkable beer, but again, only if you like lots and lots of hops. Otherwise, I honestly believer there are better, more evenly balanced double IPAs out there worth visiting. I'd take an Oaked Arrogant Bastard over the Ruination any day.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BelgianAleSlut,4.32,"Bought on recommendation from the local beer store kid expert. Says he's never had a bad experience with Stone. I had never tried their beer (maybe due to the logo?) so I started here.  Poured into pint glass. Nice carb activity and small cloud on top. Color is lighter than I expected, and is slightly darker than a golden lager.  Smells hoppy, tastes hoppy. Good tart bitterness with enough sweetness to balance. Alcohol presence @ 7.7% can be felt early and is appreciated.  Had 3 in a row to start which gave me sort of a sour stomach, so I drank the remaining beers separately by themselves.  Recommended for being a distinct IPA and based on taste.  $15.99 for a 6'er is a little more than I am willing to pay, even though my brain knows 6 at the brewpub is more like $30.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Pashtet,4.44,"This beer is so good it inspired my first review.  Appearance - Pours into an oversize wine glass a slightly cloudy deep, peachy yellow color with a luscious frothy 2"" head. Laces all the way down.  Smell - Ahhh, that perfumy, heady smell nearly knocks me over as I lift the glass to whiff it! Amazingly herbal fragrance with hints of citrus excites my senses in expectation of a flavorful brew. There are other wonderfully complex scents in the mix that are indescribable due to my lack of experience reviewing.  Taste - A smooth, creamy, well-rounded beginning that finishes with a sharp, lingering kick of hops on the tongue. I smack my lips afterward, savoring the strong flaver that remains until my next taste.  Mouthfeel - As I quaff deeply, my mouth is filled with lushness. Nothing watery here.  Drinkability - While it is wonderfully delicious brew, I wouldn't want to drink more than the couple of glasses I got from this bomber in one session.  General comments - I couldn't help taking this into my mouth in large gulps. I just wanted to fill my palate with this amazing brew to savor every bit of it fully. It is truly amazing! I highly recommend it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,eberkman,4.39,"Poured into a snifter, presenting a somewhat cloudy deep peach color with a thin white head that vanished quickly to a sheen, leaving some moderate lacing behind. I thought I'd see more head. The smell was a highly aromatic combination of piney and floral notes with sharp, grapefruity hoppiness. The taste was a bold complex panoply of malty sweetness and citric acidity with a strong, dry, extraordinarily bitter, hoppy finish. Extraordinary balance. The mouthfeel, however, was a glaring weakness and keeps this selection out of my pantheon. Very flat -- I didn't expect a lot of carbonation with a DIPA, but certainly more than I got. Kind of the consistency of a thick apple juice. Perhaps a bad bottle? I'm going to have to assume so (one of the downsides of Julio's in Westboro, Mass. -- despite their famous selection, I've had an awful lot of bad bottles there -- but I guess BeerFly is the place for that). Anyway, despite the lack of physical zest -- and again, I don't want too much in a DIPA -- it's drinkable and refreshing. The dry, hoppy, bitter finish leaves me puckering for more.  I wish I had another handy. And I wish I didn't have to get up at 5 AM tomorrow or I'd go and get myself another one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BrewMonkey,3.57,"Pours with 1/4 inch light head, light retention, clear orange/tan.  Aroma of heavy citrus, floral, honey, grapefruit hop notes.  Flavor of citrus and floral notes, mild malt backbone, fairly bitter but compliments flavor. Not as aggressive as the label suggests.  Overall fairly drinkable, not as pallate ruining as Stone purports. Decent pale ale, nothing spectacular.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Gmann,4.32,"Poured out of a bomber. The brew poured a clear golden-orange color with a nice fluffy cream colored head which dissipated into a small cap. Not as much lacing as I would expect. The smell is of citrus/grapefruit, grapefruit rind, and caramel malt. The grapefruit hop flavor blasts your palate. a bit of pine and resin. The bitter blast is followed by a semi-offsetting caramel sweetness. Definitely not as sweet as other ADIPAs, which is good in my book. I find that overly sweet IPAs bring the drinkability down. This brew has a nice balance. The feel is moderately bodied and has a creamy feel. It is bitter but doesn't blast your taste buds. This is probably the best IPA that I have tried. I wouldn't want to drink a lot of these in a session but a 22oz bomber goes down nice and easy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,OSUbrewman,4.83,"Tried this one on tap at Mad Mex in Columbus, Ohio.  Appearance: A cloudy dark orange with a fluffy white head that left some very nice lacing.  Smell: Hops were quite lemony but not overpowering. Not quite indicative of the hop assault that you experience in the taste. Subtle and pleasant.  Taste: Oh Boy. Comes on just gradual enough to pull the many complex flavors. Hops were juicy and citrusy, with nice floral notes. For as hoppy as this beer is though, I also thought that it was pretty well balanced with decent malt presence for the style. Long hoppy finish lets you appreciate this one long after your last sip. (By the way, as other reviewers note this one does mellow out as it warms, letting you get past the initial hop puch about half way through.)  Mouthfeel- Very smooth, with good carbonation.  At 7.7% this is still quite drinkable. One hell of a hoppy brew, but an outstanding taste that dwarfs other IPAs. All others pale in comparison.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,albern,3.92,"This is a hoppy beer that does mellow a bit as it warms. It pours a nice orange with some head and not much lacing. The smell is very nice, hops, sweet malts, citrus, grass. The taste is a bit too hoppy for me right out of the refrigerator, but as the beer warms its true character emerges. There is a very nice sweetness that complements the hoppy bitterness. It is medium to full bodied and the sweetness works with the consistency of the beer and reminds me of some of the weaker barley wines I've tried; we are not talking syrupy barley wine here, but there is some hints at it. The hoppy esters remain on the tongue and the after taste is not nearly as bitter as one would expect with this hoppy brew. This has been a nice change of pace for me, since I've been reviewing really bland Saranac summer ales the past few days. L'Chaim",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ElGordo,4.47,"Poured from the 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Bright orange body topped by a couple of fingers of thick, sticky white head that takes its sweet time in melting away, leaving some nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of assertive, piney, bitter hops, which pretty much overpower any other nuance that may be presence. A little bit of sweet malt comes through, along with some grapefruit notes and a whiff of alcohol. Palate is actually somewhat balanced up front, with a light malty sweetness counteracting the hop assault. Never fear, though - the serious bitterness soon takes over, coating the entire mouth in lupulin-laced delight. A mild citrus flavor comes through on the finish. Body is sticky, but not too thick - just about right for an imperial IPA. Highly drinkable for such a strong, bitter beer. Well done.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,FenwaySquid,4.7,"Presentation: 22 oz bomber, no dating of any kind, poured into a Duvel tulip glass.  Appearance: Pours a crystal clear pale copper color. The head formed thick but faded quickly into a layer on top that retained nicely.  Aroma: Lots and lots of hops, mainly floral, very inviting.  Taste: Faint malt character at the beginning, but then the hops take over. Again mainly floral and citrus, not as bitter as one would imagine but the flavor really packs a punch. The finish is all hops, slightly bitter, and hangs around for a while. My taste buds are tingling right now.  Mouthfeel: Medium body, very smooth. The carbonation balanced out nicely as well, enough to let you know it's there but not so much that it interferes.  Overall: This beer is a hop-head's dream come true. Leave it for the end of the night, though, as the name ""ruination"" fits quite well.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jp62099,4.65,"Big thanks to my little bro ""The Major"" for hooking me up with a boat load of Stone stuff, still have the DB and the Russian IMP to try yet, oh boy! Well, I may be a newly converted hop-head. The bottle said if you are new to big hops maybe don't start here, well I am, and I did, and I don't regret it in the slightest. Amber in color bubbly head with great lacing. Smell is floral, citric, hops. Taste is great, not over-powering in the bitterness dept. and has a nice malt character. This is a standout beer and if anything may just ""Ruin"" me for other IPAs.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,kajerm,3.7,"Pours cloudy amber with a thinnish resinous head, a giant clump of soap bubbles, and lacing out the ass. Very nice but standard DIPA appearance.  Aroma is all hops, grapefruit with a little grassiness. There's a little hint of tropical aroma-- mandarin orange and mango.  Opens up with fruity, hop-derived sweetness that fades into heavy bitterness. Biterness lasts for ages. Hops pretty much run the whole flavor profile, but flavor-hopping is a decent match for bittering. Mouthfeel is creamy and oily, with very light carbonation.  Drinkable for a double IPA, and ridiculously drinkable for a Stone beer.  This is way, WAY better than the Stone IPA.  NOTE: After warming up to a little under room temp, the bitterness really starts to take over. I think having this beer fridged actually made it more complex because it kept the bittering balanced-- a lot of the nice stuff I tasted before is getting harder to pick out. I hate to do it, but I have to dock this beer for taste and drinkability. For the love of God, Stone, PUT YOUR HOPS IN LATER.  (But this is still better than the IPA, and for that matter all of the other Stone beers I've tasted other than the imperial stout.)",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,atigerlife,4.08,"Poured from a bomber into a Stone glass.  Pours a cloudy orange/gold with a 2 finger slightly off-white head that is a little chunky. Head dissipates rather quickly. Lots of carbonation seen rising. A nice beer to look at.  Aroma is hops, citrus and a sort of honey sweetness.  Taste is of hops, sweet malts, citrus, piney. Actually, I was expecting to be blown away by overpowering hops, and this is not the case [I'm not a hophead, so this is good]. I found this quite nicely balanced.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, cleansing, dry and quite smooth.  Overall, I liked this even more than I was expecting. Very drinkable. Very refreshing.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jaxon53,4.3,"Served slightly chilled in a pint glass from a twenty two ounce bottle. Poured a clear golden copper like color. About three quarters of an inch of thick bubbly off-white head formed. Smelled hoppy, piney, malty and bready. Taste was equally as pleasing. Nice smooth piney hops with short citrus tones. Nice malty character that balanced it out well . Somewhat yeasty and earthy. Had a bitter hoppy bite in the finish. Alcohol was very mild in the mouth. Medium amount of carbonation. Mouthfeel was full bodied, somewhat thick, and actually quite refreshing. Drinkability was good. A very solid brew from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ekempey,4.32,"A nice white head tops this giant of an IPA off, with a nice lacing as the beer quickly vanished from my glass. The beer has a nice looking amber glow to it, and has a smell filled of hops and maybe some grapefruit? The front end of the taste is nothing but hops (maybe some caramel with it) as it rolls down your tongue, as the back end finishes with oranges and spices. Very drinkable, hard to put down, this beer feels great in my mouth, with little notice to the fact of the higher alcohol content. A good beer that I might be picking up more often.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,cbrakel,4.2,"Having recently tried a wide variety of IPA's, I decided to give this bad boy (7.70% abv) a try. Pour was good, nice foamy head, amber color, slightly fruity smell. I agree with several other reviewers that it has a slight grapefruit-like taste. The flavor is hoppy and complex, but not too strong on impact, and no lingering aftertaste. It is a very smooth IPA, in fact, and less bitter than some. I enjoyed this beer a lot. Would buy again!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,DoubleJ,4.33,"It's time to show my manhood by finally giving this brew a test drive. On to the beer:  Light orange in color with some blonde hues and a creamy head that leaves lacing all over the glass as it's sipped. Hops are certainly present in the smell, with a metallic twist and a hint of melon. The flavor - hop attack! As intense as the taste is, there's something about it that makes me want to take another gulp. The bitterness lasts long on the palate, interrupted by the occasional tropical Gummi-Saver flavor to keep me going. I didn't get much of a malty backbone, but lots of pine and citurs. Be sure to train your palate before jumping into this one. (updated 8-29-08)",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mobud,4.42,"Poured into nonic pint from bomber.  A- Burn straw color with a light small white head that lasted thru sample. Good carbonation.  S- A great hoppy grapefruit smell that was very inviting to a hophead.  T- Both pine and grapefruit with a resiny aftertaste.  M- Thick and full; exactly what you would expect from a Stone beer.  D- A great beer IMHO. The alcohol is there (7.7), but it is well hidden under the hops. This is another fine Stone product that I will have to try ontap soon.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,plaid75,4.32,"Poured a deep amber hue with a one finger foamy white head. There was good retention and lacing.  The smell was upfront sticky oily citrus and peppery hop.  The taste was also upfront heavy hops. Piney, citrus, peppery - you name it. Mild alcohol warmth.  The mouthfeel was full and a bit chewy even.  Overall a superior DIPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,greenbeaner,4.38,"Poured into a Watou chalice, the head is light and one finger thin but nicely frothy and creates adequate lacing. Deep orange in color but not quite amber. Just how an IPA should look.  Wonderful aroma, smooth floral notes up front with thin pine hop finish.  Taste...oh wonderful taste. The hops definitely stand out as the should, but you can really taste the hop flavor without receiving too much bitter punch though it definitely packs one. Very nice balance, smooth flower and citrus with a tight hop finish. Hints of orange and grapefruit.  Medium body, smooth and creamy but not thick at all. Very crisp and refreshing dry finish.  This is such a great, mouthwatering IPA. The ABV is reasonable as well which makes this a very sessionable beer. I could drink this all day long. Great hop flavor but not overkill. Doesn't numb your tastebuds. Definitely give it a shot it's a fantastic brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Pooba001,4.57,"I just realized I'd never reviewed a Stone beer on BA, despite Stone being one of the great little breweries (little back in the days when I had my first Smoked Porter at least) that got me into craft beer, so I decided to break out with a Ruination tonight.  Beer pours a great pale ale color, a nice golden shade. A beer with this much hop could easily also get a good dose of darker malt and grain to even it out, but Ruination doesn't, and stays a great pale shade. The smell is great, I can detect hop aromas as soon as the bottle is opened, still a couple feet from my nose. Big citrus and pine aromas dominate. Heavenly.  Sure its got some pucker-inducing bitter, but really its the great hop flavor that dominates over the bitterness and the slight toasty malt notes. Big citrus, herbal, and floral tastes overwhelm all else. A liquid poem to the glory of the hop indeed.  Mouthfeel is good, have to watch for astringency on a beer like this, but it avoids that well. Drinkability is great for a stronger, hoppy beer. I've gotten on a little run of pints of Ruination before and it doesn't get much better than this.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,boelker62,4.47,"A - Poured carefully into a room temperature, 10 oz. fluted glass, the white head is small, but fluffy, and diminishes quickly with little lacing. The color is a murky deep orange, not quite amber. The cloudiness is intriguing in an IPA.  S - even the scent on this brew is muti-tiered, with a heavy hops prescense, but a deep tone of grapefruit and walnut cask aging.  T - it starts sweet on the front of the tongue, and converts the entire landscape to bitterness. The long, long finish is slightly acidic, but by no means in a bad way.  M - a light, dry body with a soft carbonation. It has some great drinkability level, but you have o be a hop head first, as the label states.  D - oh, boy, I can't really expand too much on that. Yes, you can drink of this. This brew takes alot of levels of flavor, and amplifies them beyonf nuances, and ,makes them major playres.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,gunnerman,4.23,"Pours into a pint glass, pours an amazing peach color with a fluffy head that leaves some thick and heavy lace. Intense smell of some serious hops very citrusy and weedy. Taste is also very bitter no alcohol detected adn simply well balanced for a serious tasting ipa, little bubbles of carbonation dance upward in the glass. The beer is very smooth and goes down all to well, I could drink this all day , ""liquid sex."" I can taste sweet nector followed by intense bitterness; awesome crafted and a damn fine ipa.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,TheSarge,4.02,"I was very surprised when I poured this IPA. The head that was produced was a bit thinner than I expected. It was only about a finger thick, with the whole 22oz bomber poured out in to a liter stein glass. The head sticks pretty good to the end though, and is nearly pure white. The body of this brew is mildly cloudy and orangish in color, with a light amount of CO2 action.  This gives off grassy and piney aromas right off the bat. Very hop dominant in the nose at the initial crack before the pour. There is also a strong pronounced lemon fragrance here too.  I taste the very dominate hops characters of spicy pine and lemon.  This is actually quite nice. It doesn't feel as dry as most double IPAs and finishes warmly from the moderate amount of alcohol.  Overall a great IPA and I'd gladly have seconds.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,kosmoraios,4.72,"Pours a crystal-clear copper color with a nice 2-finger beige head.  Aroma is immediately (and I mean when you open the bottle) of super piney hops. If you spend some time analyzing the hop aroma, I believe you can detect several different types interlaced. Perhaps it's my imagination. Usually there's a bit of grapefruit or citrus in the aroma of an IPA, but this one was pure, piney, beautiful hops.  Taste is of. Um. Hops. Lots of delicious hops. Piney at first, more citrus comes out as the glass warms. Much fun was had attempting to guess the types of hops I was tasting. I don't know about what these other reviewers were saying about malt. Is there malt in here? Hello? Malt? Are you there? No answer.  Mouthfeel is peppery, spicy, with a slightly oily ending. The hops excite the tongue like they should in a good IPA.  Drinkability? Well. You know. You can't have more than one of these. Unless.. well.. we won't talk about that.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,theopholis,4.35,"Appearance- Pours a very clear amber/orange, with continueing efervecance and a an off-white head that is bigger than the whole outdoors. Attempts to stick to the sides of the glass, but the head is so heavy that it leaves very little lacing.  Aroma- Incredibly fresh hops with undertones of pine, and a very nice malt sweetness. Also a tad of citrusy hops as it warms.  Taste- WOW! Huge hop flavors dominate everything. You can sense a subtle underlying malt and malt sweetness character, but hops almost overpower the maltiness of it. You also get hints of an earthiness that is incredibly enticing. If you are a hophead, you will love this.  Mouthfeel- Fairly thick without being heavy. Just the perfect amount of carbonation to make it dance over your toungue without deadening your tastebuds.  Drinkability- Not great. As a hop-head, Ilove it, but a full bottle will give me heartburn. One is the perfect amount tho!!!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,goochpunch,3.77,"Pours out a copper-toned marmalade with no bubbles in the body and a decent sized head that fizzles to next to nothing. I've had DIPAs with higher abvs that have better heads than this. Smell has a general sweet to it, with tons of citrus and earth from the hops. Has a medicinal alcohol smell, which is disappointing considering the relatively low abv on this one. This one tastes rather sweet and a little tart. Some toastiness is welcome. Loads of hop flavor. Tons of grapefruit and tangerine. Doesn't get really bitter, but there is a pleasant lingering bitter after each sip. This can't be 100+ IBUs. Has a slight medicinal quality which makes it not totally work for me. Mouthfeel is excellent, and what I typically look for in a DIPA. Moderate to full body with a buzzing carbonation. I like this as it isn't really over-the-top. Tasty beer, but the medicinal quality starts to work on me after a while.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BBM,4.17,"Beer poured a somewhat clear golden color into a pint glass with not too much of a white head to speak of. The aroma was excellent-- citrus, pine, earth, and a certain sweetness added for good measure.  This is a tasty DIPA, but it is a bit similar to others I've had. There's a big, pounding influence from the pine and citrus hops, that is counteracted by a cloying sweetness. Earthy and biscuity, this beer wraps your tastebuds into submission, but that certainly isn't a bad thing. Mouthfeel is oily, but crisp and full bodied. This is a drinkable beer, even at the high ABV. Overall it's an excellent, if a bit too standard, DIPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BMoney575,3.85,"Sampled on 5-7-07  Pours a semi-cloudy orange, with little bubbles that stick to the sides of the glass. And half-inch, craggy white head lasts forever.  Smell is huge piney hops, and a good deal of sweetness. Lesser citrusy hops come through later.  Taste is intense! Huge hop flavors dominate everything. You can sense a subtle underlying malt character, but then you are attacked by a mouth-drying dose of hop bitterness. No noticeable alcohol leaves the flavors sweet and fruity.  Mouthfeel is good, thick without being heavy, and the lesser carbonation keeps the hops from becoming too spicy.  Drinkability suffers from the bitterness. Ruination is exactly the word for the huge flavors and bitterness.  Overall, one of the most bitter beers I've ever had! A little one-dimensional for my tastes but still good. Highly recommended for the hop lover.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,tgbljb,3.65,"Served as a hazy amber-orange colored beer with modest off-white head. Smell is loaded with hops with only a touch of malt to be found.

I had a small glass, and that was enough for me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Duster72,3.72,"Fresh 12 oz bottle. Pours a slightly hazy copper color with a bit over 1 finger head with moderate retention. Aroma is very nice with exceptional citrus aromas followed by sweet vanilla and some floral notes. Taste is a well balanced blend of hops with flavors of pine and citrus strongly present. Lots of hop oils and a little resin. Too out of balance with the crazy bitterness for my taste although I understand what they were going for here. It is a well made and well balanced beer, but I have had many DIPAs that are much much better.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Appearance is a copper orange, with a slight haze, not crystal clear, head was nice and frothy and left decent lacing.  Aromas were a bit of citrus but focused on the spicy/pepper notes and lots of pine.  The flavors followed that of the aroma, a bit of citrus/floral notes but heavy on the piny spicy flavors. And bitter...damn bitter. The finish was sweet and actually had a a smidge of balace considering the over the top hoppiness.  Mouthfeel was smooth, a bit sticky, and overall very nice. Drinks smooth and pretty easy for a beer of this magnitude.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,dreadnatty08,4.58,"Pours a slightly hazy copper, light caramel color. Lots of foamy, soapy, meringue like head forms, gorgeous. Very sprucy hop aroma with some citrus notes; nearly no malt aroma appears. Flavor is simply intense. This one has got to have sat on tons of hops post fermentation, probably chinook and centennial. The bitterness is not balanced at all, but who cares, I've yet to taste a beer this hopped. It's simply hop candy, so good. The finish is slightly sweet, but nothing compared to other IPAs or DIPAs.

147,4083,Onibubba,4.77,"I've put off trying this beer for some time now. Shame on me. Aggressive pour yields a persistant 2"" off white head on a deep rich golden body. Looks very nice, and has great retention. Smell is resiny, piney, with some citrus notes. Very pleasant. Someone please bottle this scent into an air freshener. Taste is also something special. A nice numbing bitterness balanced by just a touch of sweetness - but not too much. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both outstanding. Refreshing and quenching, I could down this like a Guinness. Very smooth. Alcohol is very well hidden.  All in all, an outstanding example of the style, if not my new favorite IPA/DIPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,bosco7,4.62,"Light copper with a two finger head that lasts.  Smells amazing. Apricot, grapefruit, orange, strawberry, and rose aromas. Extremely pungent.  Pine needles, grapefruit rind, some caramel in the finish along side an uppercut of bitterness. Very resiny yet floral flavors. Aggressive in every sense of the word. I love it.  Aggressive yet highly drinkable. A good thing that Stone started packaging this in six packs (though I haven't seen one yet). Body is light-medium with a slight prickle on the tongue from the carbonation. I absolutely love this beer, very similar to the regular IPA, yet not. Maximum IBUs and highly resinous flavors seperate the two IPAs. A must purchase for West Coast IPA enthusiasts.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BeerTruth,4.39,"12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass.  Haven't had this since I started reviewing beers, figured I would pick up one of the new 12 oz. singles and give it a review. I think this actually might have been the first Stone beer I had when I started drinking craft beer.  Pours a beautiful clear copper hue with an nice off-white head that sticks quite well to the glass throughout tasting. Smell is a sweet sweet citrus hop that tingles the nose with delight. I could smell this beer all day. You would think with a DIPA the hops would dominate the flavor, but Stone does such a great job of balancing the malt and hop in this brew. Starts with a bready-malt flavor that gives way to a powerful citrus hop blast. A good floral note lingers in the aftertaste as well. Mouthfeel is a bit oily in the mouth. For a DIPA, this one isn't dry/bitter hardly at all which I really enjoy about this beer. So drinkable, maybe too drinkable...wait a minute, what the hell am I saying. Stone contiues to amaze.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,malty,4.75,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a standard pint glass. Gorgeous golden orange color with just a smidgen of chill haze; very clear none the less. A 1"" cream colored loose head forms and stays as the visible moderate carbonation rises. Bountiful globs of lace all the way down the glass.  The smell of this beer is rather exceptional. The sweet edges caress of the glorious hop ensemble that utterly fills the nostrils. Vanilla and almond nougat weave in-and-out of the citrus juicy hop experience.  The flavors are perfectly balanced...perfectly. The sweet malt foundation serves as a springboard to the luscious and multi-dimensional fresh hop flavors. There's a gracefulness to this double IPA whereas the dry and (again) juicy hops form harmonious a union with the slightly powdered sugary malt underbelly creating an utterly quaffable and flavorful concoction.  Mouthfeel is terrific. Medium bodied with a perfect level of light carbonation with a lingering dry and bitter finish.  Drinkability is fantastic. The easiest drinking double IPA I've ever had the pleasure to try.  This ale is superb. My favorite hoppy beer so far in 2007. There's nothing in-your-face about this beer, although the label illustrates something a bit different. I found this ale to be posses a rather quiet strength that satisfies on all fronts. It even produces rather flavorful hop burps. Excellent!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,SaltyLime,2.82,"Appearance - Nice clear amber color with a little foamy head.  Smell - Great smells of citrus and hops. Flowery.  Taste - Orange, lemon zest. Sharp and bitter.

147,4083,Daehpoh,4.32,"Served in a pint glass from the tap. Clear golden amber in color. Lighter hue than some other DIPAs and without the typical haze. Excellent lacing. Smell was pine and citrus hop aromas with some candied sweetness. The draft version has more fresh hop and pine aroma than I remember the bottle having. The taste is big on hops, certainly one of the most bitter DIPAs out there. The hop flavors were young and bursting with grapefruit and even some pineapple flavors. Caramel malt flavors also present, but certainly take a back seat to the hops. I find this beer quite drinkable even though it definitely assaults the taste buds. After a few, it would be difficult to distinguish tastes very accurately. The alcohol isn't too high and is not noticable at all in the taste. Overall, I recommend this primarily for proponents of very hoppy, bitter brews. I certainly plan on enjoying more Ruination in the future.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,nwshull,4.37,"I am drinking this beer right now, and its my first review so bear with me.  Its poured into a pint glass.  Appearance: This is your typical IPA color somewhere on the gold side between gold and brown. Its not very clear. The head settles fairly nicely at about 1 inch and then goes away.  Smell: Delicious! Grapefruity I'd say.  Taste: Good if you like a bitter beer, I do. I generally drink dogfishhead IPA, the taste here would be right between 60 and 90 minute. Its strong but not overly strong. Its got a grapefruit and hop taste, its very refreshing. The alcohol is pretty well masked for an upper 7 percent ABV compared to other IPAs I've had like White Hawk.  Mouthfeel: Its got a good balance between bubble size and frequency, ideal for my palate. It goes down well for its alcohol content.  Drinkability: As mentioned before the alcohol content makes it hard to drink more than 1 possibly on a weekend 2 bottles of this (they the larger bottles). However its a true pleasure to drink. I'm very happy with my purchase here, definitely recommended for hop-heads, but if you like a more moderate level of hops in this beer its not for you.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jbsteiny,4.37,"I remember drinking this out of the bottle for the first time and thinking it was a straight up 5 all around. Now after I've become very familiar with the Stone way of life, I have a bit more perspective (and appreciation) for the beer that brought me around to the gargoyle -- is the ""ruination"" that you'll be ruined from appreciating other types of beer? Those bastards.  It pours a slightly hazy orange-amber, with a slightly honey-colored head, tight bubbles, but not much retention. Smells like straight up pineapple juice. Yum-o. The website says that it's Magnum and Centennial hops -- ah, Magnum. The taste is remarkably smooth for a 100+ IBU selection -- the bitterness comes and goes, or maybe it's always there, but masked during the middle of the flavor arc by the tropical fruits and the smooth malts. Steady carbonation adds to the smooth mouthfeel. If it weren't so strong (and you can feel the heat as you sip it), I'd hook this up all night. As it is, I think two is my limit.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Redwood21,4.12,"This beer poured a hazey golden color with a nice white head that lasted a good while. the aroma is all hops, relatively strong and very pleasant just the same. the taste is bitter hops, but not as strong as i feel this beer claims. its supposed to wreck your palate and maybe it does a little bit, but for me this was a pleasant double ipa, but nothing over the top. its a little dry on the mouth just because of the hopness, but its good just the same. worth a try, but not the hype. i will enjoy another. 4-23-07  *5-1-2007 Note Edit from here on: I still do not feel this beer destroys your palate, but i figured i'd try it again since my area just got 6 packs. I am becoming very fond of the taste. it is by no means a palate killer, which i guess i view as a good thing. the head retention is also good, more than the first beer.

147,4083,geexploitation,4.35,"Pours a light amber, clear of yeast, with a fluffy head that fades to a collar but leaves a ton of lacing. Aromas of zesty, piney hops, passionfruit and a surprising, very welcome malt note: rich caramel malts with some spiciness on top, with just enough sweet smells to balance out the hops somewhat. On the palate, really smooth malts (some of the best I've had for this style of beer) of soft caramel make the first appearance, but after that it's all hops, with the malt serving only as a (very solid) base on which to build a huge, magnificent hop house. The bitterness is fantastic -- big and citrusy (lots of grapefruit, a bit of tropical fruits) and just a bit harsh, with a tobacco finish. Mouthfeel is extraordinary for the style -- huge hoppy, resiny feeling made more than tolerable by a huge malt component and good carbonation. If only more DIPAs were like this -- all the elements play well together, nothing is out of whack.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I expected this to be a bit darker like many other DIPA's.  S: The aroma off this beer hits you in the face hard with a fresh grapefruit. There are other citrus fruits in there that assault you as well.  T: The flavor is actually a bit much for me. There was a decent grapefruit flavor initially, but it is quickly overcome with some deeper grassy hop flavors. The beer still has good balance though.  M: It had a medium body, which seemed to suit it nicely. The carbonation produced a bit of a pucker feeling.  D: Personally, the hop flavor was a bit much for me. I did like the initial flavor, but the aftertaste didn't sit right with me. It's still a decent beer though.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,SaCkErZ9,4.29,"""Stone Ruination IPA. So called because of the immediate ruinous effect on your palate. The moment after the first swallow, all other food and drink items suddenly become substantially more bland than they were just seconds before. By the time you develop a taste for this beer, you may find that you are permanently ruined from being able to enjoy lesser brews. Good. We freely admit to doing this. On purpose even! People are sometimes crazy enough to thank us for this assault. To which we reply ""Youre Welcome"".  ""Out of the smoldering ashes of the Stone Anniversary IPAs, the Ruiniation IPA is born. Rising like the phoenix comes this over-hopped jewel, bringing with it not the acrid sting of smoldering embers, but the abundantly pungent aroma of hops. Bountiful hops. Glorious hops. If you are not already a confirmed hop head; if you have not already converted your palate to the glory of the righteous joy that miraculous little green flower brings to the senses, then this is NOT the place to start, for it will bring you nothing but shock. All its richly layered subtleties will be for naught. Intense hop character will only be perceived as binding and blinding bitterness. Does the experienced hop lover perceive this in a different way? Well, yes and no. The matriculated imbiber is not numb to the rambunctious rush of bitterness---indeed that is a major element of the allure---however they are also able to look beyond to the well spoken yet understated malt presence. The aromatic alcohol tones. The swirling meld of naturally occuring complex flavor compounds courtesy of our little friends known as ""brewers yeast cells."" God bless the yeast, the malt and the HOPS!""   Poured from 22oz bottle into an imperial pint glass. Orange yellow colored hue with a nice tight bubbly foamy white head on nice retention. Aroma is strictly hops and citrusy at that. Very enticing. Grapefruit, citrus, grass, about all of the aromas in hop available are represented here. Very balanced beer. Absolutely delicious. Not too much of a ""Ruinator"" but delicious nevertheless. A little out of balance and out of whack as things dont seem to meld very well, but a very nice beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Neehan,4.1,"Pours a pure, light gold with good effervesence and a sizable, diligent head. Light hitting the glass shines in many directions. Ahh, the smell of hops invades the nose with a bittersweet complexity that makes the mouth water. The smell fades to a honey-like scent after a few sips. The taste is no secret, a bombartment of hops that come at you from all directions, but pleasantly. Strongly bitter finish and aftertaste. Biting in the mouth so you remember it sip after wonderful sip.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,dickieb,4.22,"I work in mass now, so my beer selction just grew. Poors a cloudy copper, with an avergae head, that quicky disapates. Smells of all kinds of hops, and a tad sweet. Piny hops, and lots of them also some citrusy hops in the taste, which has a bit of maltyness lingering. Feals like a Dipa should in your mouth, and still maintains a deacent drinkability. Quite a solid beer, kinda in a league of its own with the IBU's, but im not complaining",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,styxnpicks,4.12,"A: poured a nice golden copper with off white head  S: WOW, this one smelled so fresh from the bottle, just like fresh hops and that fresh woodsy outdoor smell  T: once past the bitter initial of the hops this one had a nice malt and long finish  M: Medium body, a little lighter than I expected but still the almost perfect amount of carbonation to dry it out  D: Sadly this one was so bitterly over hopped it resulted in a drain pour for me :(  notes: this is a very hopped up IPA style beer, its correct for the style of a bitter DIPA its very over hopped to the point of being almost undrinkable, still with drinkability being its only downfall its worth sampling with others so it doesn't go to waste, if only it didn't have such a high IBU rating.... of course if it didn't it wouldn't be as fun nor adequate for the style",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The only knock, drinkability, however that could be a knock on any DIPA, due to high alcohol content, but I wasn't complaining! This beer could certainly get you in trouble with its smooth yet hoppy flavor. This is up there with/perhaps better than the best DIPA's I've had, including DFH 90 and Victory Hop Wallop.

Obviously lots of sweet hop aroma with it coming across in the form of citrus and pine.  T: Pine and woody flavors with light citrus also in the mix. Definitely leans heavily to the side of hops in the hop/malt balance equation. The hops are nicely balanced between sweet and bitter. An extremely long lasting bitter hop aftertaste, it does as advertised and ""ruins"" the palate for quite some time.  M: A nice mouthfeel, it overwhelms the palate with hops.  D: Although it is rather smooth for being 100+ BTU's I don't think this is a beer that I would be having more than one per sitting. The hop-bomb is nice but can get overwhelming after a while. All in all a very good DIPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The hops are sweet, not bitter. The malt is biscuity but very subtle. The hops are so fragrant; strong, but not overpowering.  Wonderful hop flavor. They are piney and sweet, with a slightly bitter ending. It's a serious hop presence, with only mild dry malt. but the hops are so delicious and perfect. Amazing balance.  Thick and creamy, nice and well-bodied. Substantial. I can drink it all night long. Remarkably drinkable for such a hoppy IPA.

147,4083,ScottAW,4.77,"As a bartender who gets to try LOTS of samples, you better impress me if you want to find a place in my home fridge. Thanks Stone, you've done it again. I'll admit going into this that im a bit Stone-biased being a huge fan of the Arrogant Bastard, but here goes.  Read The bottle first, Stone always has something witty to say...  Poured from a bomber into a standard pint glass, pours light, i expected something a bit darker. Not much head, but the lacing hangs around from start to finish.  Take a big whiff, you know something strong is happening here, plenty of hops about to attack.  First sip is a good smack in the mouth, very nice. This beer really wakes up the back of the tongue, makes your mouth water a bit. Hey, they warned you it was going to be pungent (if you took the time to read).  Mouthfeel is actually lighter than expected for such a strong flavor/higher abv, works for me just, makes it easier for a session.  Overall, a fantastic beer, plenty of flavor, but easy to drink with a strong front, and a nice light aftertaste.

147,4083,0tt0,3.97,"22-oz. bottle, screen printed-- no freshness date indicated (and none needed, given the hops).  Pours a hazy orange/peach color that is remniscient of a Belgian tripel. Not much in the way of head, though it looks quite tasty.  Nose of pine, grapefruit, and a bit of lime. My god, its a hoppy beer. I'm appetized. A tiny bit of a cracker or biscuit malt peeks through as well.  Hop punch up front itsn't as bitter as advertised. Resinous and oil at first, with the grapefruit taking the lead. Middle features a quick caramel flash followed by a dry as the desert, bitter, pungent finish. Intense, but satisfying. Aftertaste lingers and teases the tongue for a full minute or so.  Mouthfeel is nice medium body with a dancing carbonation fizz.  A terrific IPA that is surprisingly balanced. The malt is actually there, and the hoppy onslaught is apparent at the close.

Almost instantly upon pouring, the aroma of pineapples was detected. Sweet pineapple and a bit of sticky pine resin in the aroma. Taste is as expected. Massive pine and citrus hop flavors. Long, intense bitterness in the aftertaste. My mouth is watering after every sip. Hops overwhelm what malt may have been there to bring this up to 7.7%abv. Body on the light-medium side.

Lot's of sticky lacing cascades down the glass like a waterfall. Hops fill the olfactory senses with just a touch of alcohol. True to the style this beer is all about the hops. Citrus, orange, tangerine, pineapple, and grapefruit rind. What stands this beer a part from the pack this the intricut mix of the malts, hops and alcohol that gives it the perfect flavor for DIPAs. Mouthfeel is sticky and wrecks havoc on the tastebuds as others due of the style. But Ruination is also silky, creamy, and smooth. Kudos to Stone brewing for setting the standard for DIPAs. An excellent beer.

147,4083,vwcraig,3.95,"Poured a rich golden color into an AleSmith pint glass. Firm and thick, one-finger white head with very little carbonation bubbles. Very clear. Smell is of a light citrus and toasted malts. Taste is more of the same with toasty taste followed by a light fruity taste. Piney hop taste comes out in background. Long, drying bitterness. Medium bodied, but somehow mouth-filling. Also is sticky with low carbonation felt. Drinkability is decent but not the hop-bomb I was expecting with the Ruination tag. Could have a couple of these in a sitting.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,barefootbrewer,4.34,"This beer poured a hazy golden color with a beautiful thick head. The aroma is of hops  delightful and fresh. The flavor of this beer is dominated by hops, but there is enough malt to balance it nicely. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and perhaps a bit creamy. As for drinkability.this beer is delicious. I find that it is smoother than I had anticipated. I will definitely look for this again!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,JoeyBeerBelly,4.82,"22 oz bomber  Ok, this is everything a double IPA should be. I gave it a few 5's because IMO it's one of the best I've had to date.  Poured in to my Stone Brewing pint glass, I pour slow to avoid much of a head but I did get a 1/2 inch layer of white foam which left very nice lacing behind.  It smells extremely hoppy, nice northwestern pine hop scent!  I LOVE the taste of this beer, I gave the regular Stone IPA a few 5's for the style and this is almost perfect for it's style as well.  The hops come through 10 fold and I find the bitter sweetness of hop making me want more and more.  Drinkable?... Hell Yeah!... I could drink quite a few of these until the sedative effects of the hop kicked in and put me to sleep...  sweet (hoppy) dreams!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,saintwarrick,4.47,"Where to begin. Finally able to get my hands on a few bottles over here on the right coast. Pours a golden amber with a great head that stays with you the whole way down, with a nice lace that stays on the glass. The smell and the perfume of the hops forcefully opens up your nostrils when you smell and open up to drink it. You can almost smell the grapefruit rinds, the citrusy smell is so prevalent. Pouring a bottle of this, you might be able to smell it in the next room. Hoppy-plus taste that isn't too dry, actually tastes a little more alcoholic than it is. Hard to differentiate this from the 9% Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA. It has a solid malt balance, but the hops rule this brew. So aromatic, but I find this a little more drinkable than the DFH 90. A great brew for any hophead.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,rocketmotor,2.86,"Poured from bottle, active pour yields good head, nicely colored off-white with a golden tint. Leaves nice lacing on glass. The color is yellow orangish, looks too close to a macro lager for my taste.  Smell is really lacking for me. It just smells like an English ale of weak IPA. Good hop flavor with a nice, mild malt backing. There is a little bit of sweetness too. The hops are the predominant flavor with a very long finish, great hop flavor but not bitter, very smooth. The hop flavor stays in your mouth after swallowing but it is very nice, no need to have a drink of water like some other IIPAs require. While good tasting, it does not seem like an Imperial IPA to me, too mild. Good mouthfeel, provides a nice coating with requisite weight.  Drinkability is high, I could easily enjoy more than one.  This beer did not live up to reputation nor the name. Maybe the weak aroma indicates an old sample, no dating on bottle. I would like to try a known fresh sample, but this beer, while good as an IPA did not meet up to my standards for an IIPA nor did it meet up to it's namesake.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Fresh citrusy hops are on the forefront. I'd call this a clean, hoppy double IPA. Not much malt to get in the way - not quite Hop Wallop in lack of malt, but still very much emphasizing the hops. And what tasty hops those are. Nice.  M: Nice carbonation level to tickle the throat, but a relatively clean finish (with hops lingering of course!) that makes this oh so drinkable.  D: One extremely drinkable double IPA.  Highly recommended. Classic West Coast Double IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,skillerified,4.05,"Pours with about a half finger, off white head and good, immensely sticky lacing. About the color of apple juice, golden hued red and orange. Light and fine carbonation bubbles are clearly visible, yet the brew is still a touch hazy.  Spice and fruit first hit the nose on a deep sniff. Fresh grassy scents follow. Banana is the most noticable scent in the fruit family. The spice is of two types, one fairly common but hard to place, maybe alcohol blended with something else, the other is completely foreign to me and astringent, yet somehow quite enticing. A little mint also makes itself known over time. After a little warmth and aggitation the floral notes begin to make their way to the top. For a while there it was getting more complex by the minute, but it seems to stop with the floral scents. Not bad by any means though.  Taste seems a little less complex than I'd hoped for. There is a surprising little sweet kick at the front end, a little caramel and a little bready, just before the citric hop wallop drops on you. Pine comes in on the finish with a fairly strong alcohol aftertaste. I'm actually kind of surprised at how little there is to taste here. You get a lot of citrus flavors, some pine and alcohol and that little malty kick at the beginning, but little else. Taste wise, this is kind of average. Not untasty, but not a world beater either.  Surprising balance to be found here. The hop bitterness, as advertised, is impressive, but the sweet malty backbone is certainly no push over. The carbonation is stong, but not overly aggressive for the style. Well done on the mouthfeel.  Not the best Double IPA I've had, but pretty well balanced. A must for hopheads, all others could probably pass it without missing much.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,udubdawg,4.61,"22 oz silkscreened bomber...all to myself.  Beer pours a light orange color with nice clarity and a big off-white head that quickly subsides to a more stubborn thin cap. Phenomenal lacing.  Nose is hops of all sorts of varieties. Wonderful, and difficult to stop sniffing this! Overall fruity sweetness, a hint (HA!) of grapefruit, other citrus, grassy, pine, and floral - it's all there. All together this makes my mouth water. Alcohol presence is light. I could make an air freshener for my car of this.  A healthy malt backbone is noticeable with this beer, but to call it balanced would be ridiculous. Full of unbalanced resiny fresh hoppy deliciousness - everything noted in the aroma is there, along with some caramel amd biscuit malt notes hiding behind the hops that clobber the palate. Creamy smooth medium bodied beer - feels wonderful across the tongue, with a big bitter drying finish. Appropriate carbonation is somewhat expressive as it hits, but not lasting or getting in the way of the flavors. Not feeling the alcohol in the mouth but it warms the stomach by mid bottle.  Despite the 100+ IBUs this is never difficult to drink - in fact it is quite the opposite. A favorite of mine out of the big IPAs - many double IPAs have a huge malt backbone to balance out the hops and corresponding alcohol levels at 9% or above - this doesn't try to be something it isn't. I'm not going to knock it, but the label isn't lying - it really DOES have a ""ruinous"" effect on the palate, so drinking a bunch of this with numbed taste buds seems pointless. If you like untamed fresh hop flavors, this is for you. If not, don't bother. Nice that I didn't have to share this one, but it was my last bomber.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Almost can smell the sap dripping out of the bottle. Also, present are some pineapple and other tropical fruits. There also seems to be some caramel malts with bready yeast.  taste: The piney hops shine through with the fruits and spice. The flavors meld as the beer warms and balances very nicely. The caramel malt provides a strong backbone for the rest of the flavors to rest.  mouthfeel: Medium body with lively carbonation. The finish is dry and the hops linger.  drinkability: I could drink these one after the other.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,prototypic,4.37,"Appearance: Pours a bit of a hazy, golden color. Nice two finger head that left heavy lacing down the mug.  Smell: Strong, piney hop smell. For any admitted hop head, this is going to smell fantastic. There are some citrus undertones (perhaps some mango and nectarine). To my surprise, Im picking up a faint malty smell. Hops are the dominating feature here.  Taste: It tastes sweet initially. I'm actually picking up a malty taste early on. Shortly after though, hops take over and simply dominate. This has a strong bitter kick to it. Tastes like a great IPA on steroids. There is a citrusy flavor to it (perhaps nectarine or peach). This is truly superb.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This definitely has a strong, bitter taste to it. I wouldnt characterize it as a session brew, but I really enjoy drinking it. More than one bomber would be a push though. It does go down surprisingly easy considering its over 7%. Overall, its one of the top DIPAs Ive tried and probably my favorite out of Stones usual arsenal. Its fantastic and highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Gatch,4.3,"The ""Best by:"" date was 2/28, so I missed that by 9 days, but I assume that wouldn't make a major difference.  A - A deep golden color w/ a thin, creamy white head. S - Hops, citrus, hops, fresh pine, and hops. T - Very hoppy and an explosion of citrus. Mostly grapefruit and lemon, but also some papaya. Only a slight alcohol presence, but very welcomed to accompany the hops. It seems to be more ""fresh"" tasting, rather than ""bitter."" M - The hops and alcohol engorge the mouth to create an amazing mouthfeel that finishes creamy and strong. D - An extremely drinkable Double IPA. Stone sure knows how to make a beer. Ruination is definitely not an introductory beer. In no way is it overbearing where you can't drink it, but you have to be ready for the hops.

147,4083,dblinkhorn,4.1,"Poured from a 22oz bottle into my Stone IPA glass.  Appearance - Pours with a three-finger creamy off-white head. It has good retention and eventually stops at a thin cap of creamy foam. The beer is perfectly clear and a golden/straw in color. There is decent, patchy lacing left as it goes down.  Smell - Sweet and tropical fruity aromas from the Amarillo hops. Also some piney/citrusy hops smells as well. A nice mixture of two of the main and distinct hop flavor types. Rich sugary bready aroma from the malt ties it all together nicely. There is also the scent of some burnt brown sugar also. Moderate alcohol on the nose.  Taste - Juicy and fruity hops again up front. The bitter, citrusy, piney hops compliment the former immediately after the initial flavor. Sweet cooked malt comes in the middle with more tropical fruitiness mixed in. The aftertaste becomes quite bitter, but not as in-your-face as expected. The pine/hop resin also lends to a separate bitterness flavor. Also there is moderate earthiness. The alcohol presence is average throughout.  Mouthfeel - Quite smooth and somewhat wet. Has a nice foamy carbonation effect as it enters your mouth. The overall carbonation has some bite and high activity as the start but almost immediately becomes clam and smooth. This beer has a medium body.  Drinkability - Lots of bitterness and fruity hops so be prepared. The alcohol isn't so bad as I thought, though. Strong flavors overall, though.  A hop head's delight.

I am drinking from a pint glass poured from a 22 oz. bomber.  Appearance: Pours a nice orange-copper color with nice 1 1/2 finger thick white head. Decent retention, nice lacing.  Smell: It does not take a genius to realize from the smell what lies in store. Very hoppy nose! I smell fruits, citrus, and floral. Maybe a hint of sweet black cherry. No doubt from the aroma that there is alcohol in this brew!  Taste: When it hits pallet there is quite the malty body. However, just as it enters your gullet the hops blast onto the scene. Along with the alcohol. Not too much, but a nice warming sensation. Aftertaste is quite complex with nice bitterness, but not overly bitter. Floral notes really come through here. Definitely leaves you ready for the next heavenly sip.  Mouthfeel: I must admit that it is a slight bit thin for my liking. The flavors more than compensate for this, but it feels like the consistency of apple juice in the mouth.  Drinkablity: I could drink this beer for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! Then maybe a couple for a nightcap. Love this beer!!

Aroma is huge with waves of stewed grapefruit boiled down with Pinus Strobus leaving my nose hairs curled a bit with nasal passages wide open waiting for more.  Tastes of overripe grapefruit with a hint of floral essence. This rools into fields of hos, follwed by hills of hops. Carbonation is just enough to ripple across the tongue. The hills are alive with the taste of hops. Finishes bitter and dry, twisting the tongue, with hairs standing on end.  I have had this a million times but it never gets old, I guess that is why sometimes I don't review a beer the first time I drink it - to make sure it is not an anomoly.

Smell at first was not so great, with what seemed like dishwater. As it warmed a bit though (not significantly) there were plenty of hops, some tangerine, and a bit of funk as well (oxidation?). Taste was perfectly crisp, with the hops hitting you up front, followed by some grapefruit and other citrus fruits. The lingering taste on this beer is ever so bitter, and damn pleasing. Mouthfeel was surprisingly light, however the hop profile is really in your face. Alcohol is not apparent really, though it does not need to be in that the flavors are all pretty extreme. This is one of my all time favorites for this style in that it is not too sweet like so many other double ipas i try. This one is bitter, crisp and delicious. Thank God it is readily available in this area. Cheers",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jmalex,4.11,"It's been a busy couple weeks lately, so tonight I took the time to sit down with something from the ""special box"". Ruination was the choice tonight, simply because I can't believe I haven't tried it yet.  APPEARANCE: Pours a clear golden color that has obvious ruby red tones to it. Excellent color. A rocky, one finger head drops stubbornly to diffuse white cap. It leaves large curtains of lace all about the glass.  SMELL: The sweet, resinous hops are relentless! Citrus is the most dominating aroma with some floral coming through. As hoppy as the aroma is, some sweet malts can be sensed trying to shine through, though they're quickly stifled. But back to the hops - their aromas are very intense and flavorful. But strangely the amount and magnitude are not there. A scaled back smell of very strong aromas... if that makes any sense.  TASTE: The tasted started out very similar to the smell. The hops hit immediately with a punch, but settled in with a pleasant citrusy sweetness. A pungent bitterness follows, almost to remind that, yes, this is a big IPA. But there's yet another twist in this already complex beer. The bitterness changes to an overwhelmingly grassy, plant-like taste which made me say 'Whoa' aloud. And then expecting this to last to the finish, I found that all the flavors were whisked away in an impressively clean finish for such a big beer. This is one of the most complex IPAs I've ever had. What a ride!  MOUTHFEEL: Mouthfeel is malty and leaves a slick film in your mouth after it's finished. Carbonation is good.  DRINKABILITY: For such a big beer, this is very easy drinking. The flavors are intense and well-defined without getting in each other's way and being too much. Well done.  What better way to forget about a hectic week than going on a new adventure. This beer surely qualifies. Once again, I have to give credit to Stone for crafting such a wonderful beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Alkey,4,22oz. bottle poured a cloudy golden color with a large white head that leaves a few specks of lace around the glass. Smells of citrusy hops maybe some grapefruit and pineapple. Taste of slightly sweet malt up front with a bit of a dry hop bitterness towards the end. The feel is somewhat light and has a bit of a stickiness to it. This brew is pretty easy to drink but I'm not a big fan of the flavors of yeast and malt they chose for this IPA and I'm sure that because of those flavors and the lack of a big hop presence that this bottle may have a little age on it.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,cameraman,4.5,"A dark amber color that fades to alighter shade towareds the bottom of the glass. A quater inch thick forms, that slowly laces down the glass. A fragrant floral scent is dominant at first sniff, then earthy and citrusy aromas gradually become more apparent. At first taste the malt is very definitive, and then it is overwhelmed by immense hop flavor and bitterness. Those flavors attack the palate and linger there for some time. A thin feel at the start, but it gradually becomes more hefty as it reaches the back of the throat. This beer is a hopheads delight, strong aroma and flavor make this a must try beer, for anyone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jjmunro,4.09,"A fantastic offering poured from a 22 oz. bottle  A: A hazy golden orange pour with a thick, airy head that turns into a nice lace.  S: Obvious citrus and piny scents from the abundance of glorious florally hops. Picked up some pleasant pineapple aromas as well.  T: The malt does a surprisingly solid job of balancing the 100+ IBU's. The hop bitterness packs a very pleasing punch. Hopheads like myself are quite happy with the complex hop profile.  M: Surprisingly smooth, leaves a bitter, lingering aftertaste, yet a fantastic one at that.  D: Can't wait to drink this one again. A utopian hoppy, offering that stands out from other IPA's.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,muffguy4beer,4.3,"Poured from 22 oz bottle into imperial pint glass.  Appearance: Nice head that is airy and settles within a minute or two but leaves nice lacing as I drink. Orange in color, a little hazy but a very welcoming sight.  Smell: Big citrus smells somewhat piney. There is some more going on in the nose of this big brew but I can't really discern them due to my apparent unworthiness.  Taste: Grapefruity citrus balanced out though with some nice malt. Somewhat floral and then BOOM the bitterness punches the back of the tongue like nick borsetti dropping pat kelly in the st. john's prep cafeteria so many years ago. This beer is way more balanced than I thought it was going to be. The malt definitely stands up to the unimaginable amount of hops that are in this beer.  Mouthfeel: Nicely carbonated, smooth and creamy.  Drinkability: Welcome to hop country. This beer is lights out in terms of being able to drink anything else after but definitely one of my favorite beers. One in a sitting though, usually at the end of the session. Nicely balanced, comparatively speaking.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Enola,4,"This beer looks is a hazey orange and there is little head. The smell is hoppy and a bit of the alcohol shows as well. The taste is bitter and the alcohol deffinatly shows here. The mouthfeel is sticky and the bitterness last a long time. Drinkable, but be aware that this beer will warm your innards in a hurry.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Jwaks,4.12,"Serving 22oz bottle  Ample carbonation races upwards through a honey colored body toward a once pillowy white head. Abundant sticky lacing is left about the glass as an impressive head recedes to a cap of course froth.  Hop oil aromas pop upfront masking ample sweet pale malt; lots of bright, pungeant citrus, ripe honeydew, and hints of pine shine through a moderately aromatic nose.  Massively bitter hops hit hard on the entry followed closely by refreshing lemon, mild melon and a bit of sweet pale malts on the finish. Hop bitters grip well on the finish for well over thirty seconds creating a zesty aftertaste with a dab of citrus peel.  Somehow stone manages to make this hoppy brew very approachable and devilishly smooth. This coats the mouth with aplomb leaving no part of your palate untouched by hoppy goodness. Aggressive hops upfront can come off as a bit harsh, pale malts and fruit work toward balancing this massively hoppy brew.  Moderately strong in alcohol and big on hops, this is one of the more drinkable DIPAs out there. Drink this one with care, it will totally domainte your senses.  Once again Stone provides us a tour de force in brewing with hops!  Cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,quikfish13,4.3,"Ruination gives off a gold with a light amber colored body and a very light and frothy head. Very good amount of carbonation with a smell very strong in hops. Not so much a citrus scent but verry sweet and hoppy none the less.  Tastes not so much in bitterness until the very end. Hints of citrus are stronger here than in the aroma wich does seem a little strange to me. Leaves a frothy feel in the mouth and a bitter feeling on the back of the tounge once swallowed. Lite in body and easy to go down, highly drinkable, highly recomended. All hail the hops.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ruinationation,4.68,"Pourd a light copper color with golden hues, large white frothy head that fades into a chunky headburg that floats in the middle. A very good looking beer.  Hop punch to the nose that makes you tear up with a smile! Citrus and pine follow, very earthy overall.  Hops and grapefruit bitterness with a good amount of malt, not alot of malt but just enough.  Would of liked this to be a little thicker but thats like saying I wish Jessica Alba was a little taller, it really doesn't matter in this case.  One of my favorites for awhile now and will continue to be. If you plan on drinking different beer that session save this SOB for last.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S - Full of sweet citrus aromas - grapefruit, orange, and lemon.  T - Bitter taste up front consisting of woody and earthy flavors. Biscuity malt finishes things up.  M - Medium body, surprisingly smooth mouthfeel.  D - Good for the ABV, I hardly noticed the alcohol at all.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,crwills,3.85,"First of two bombers purchased at Premier Gourmet in Buffalo.  Poured a very clear, uniform amber into a pint glass with a small bubbly head.  Aroma is tangering and sour citrus, pine (but no soap), with a little bit of hidden sugary malt.  Flavour is numbingly dry pink grapefruit rind, blood orange, an oatmeal malty backbone, some peppery spice, and a little bit of scotch as it warms. Good mouthfeel, but nothing special.  Fun beer to drink, but don't plan on more beers after it if you want to taste them!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,RidiculedDisplay,4,"Poured into an oversized wine glass.  Appearance: Pours with a one-finger head that dissipates after a few minutes into a quarter-finger or so. The lacing is somewhat minimal, but present, and presents arm-like formations. Body is a copper amber blood orange color that is pretty. A good look.  Smell: Sweet floral and grapefruit, orange, lemon aromas. Pine and grass on the back-end. An overall sweetness to the aroma. Compared to other DIPA's, this has a more subdued strength, but it *just* croshes that ""Double"" threshold. A good and unoffensive introduction to the style.  Taste: Grapefruit, floral, with some orange and lemon zest and a more noticeable pine presence. A serious IBU-packed bitterness on the tongue. The alcohol is barely noticeable, although this is a very low ABV DIPA.  Mouthfeel: Slightly oily with good carbonation. Juicy.  Drinkability: An intensely drinkable DIPA. Not at all overpowering, in alcohol or hops. As I said previously, would be an excellent introductory beer for the style, perhaps for those you know who are enjoying the ""Single"" AIPA variety but have yet to take the ""Imperial/Double"" etc. leap.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,velo343,3.8,"Appearance - Pours a dark orange with a touch of red. A large, fluffy white head, lots of retention and lacing.  Smell - Lots of pine, like a fresh cut christmas tree. And citrus--grapefruit, orange, some lemon. A bit of grassy hops notes, and caramel underneath all of the hops. A very slight hint of butter.  Taste - Very piney and lemony. A good bit of bitterness completes the hop profile. The hops really dominate here, although there is some malt with a general toasted flavor that meshes with the bitterness. Slight breadiness, like a honey wheat. The beer is fairly thick, but not at all syrupy. Finishes very dry.  Drinkability - While an good overall beer from Stone, I think I expected more balance of hops and malt. I really enjoyed the hop profile, but didn't feel there was the malt to back it up. Even with those criticisms, I did enjoy it, just can't rate it too highly.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,trevorwideman,4.45,"Thanks to fisherman34 for sharing this bottle with me and rudge75. Bomber poured into a pint glass.  Pours a light unfiltered copper colour, medium carbonation, and a generous head. Good head retention that leaves a nice lacing all the way down the glass. Aroma is very heady. Sweet, flowery, earthy, and a little spicy. There's a butterscotch malt character in there as well. Simply delicious aroma that leaves me wanting to smell for a while before I sip.  On first sip you definitely get the ""hop bomb"" character, grapefruit citrus predominates the hop profile, but there's a lovely grassy and earthy quality as well. Liquorice/anise flavour comes out of the mix, and a Hefty malt backbone that's toasted and biscuity with a little bit of sweet caramel, but not too sweet by any means. Mouthfeel is just mildly carbonated, medium bodied and dry. Slides down like water and I wanted more as soon as I finished my glass. Dangerously hidden alcohol makes this one a lot of fun. This is a great IPA and one I'm pleased to have finally tried. Cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,JohnnyM2002,4.08,"Sampled from a 22 oz bomber, poured into a chalice at 45 degrees.  A - Poured a lovely cloudy-yellow with a medium off-white head that left some pretty sticky lacing. Good carbonation as well.  S - Very hoppy aroma, on a grassy backbone. A little sweetness detected.  T - Not quite 'ripping-taste-buds' hoppy, but still loads of hops packed into this DIPA. Malty accompaniment to the grassy, juicy hops.  M - Medium body with a very good finish....crisp and bitter, but with a lingering alcohol presence that blends very well with the hops.  D - First time sampling from a bottle, having consumed from tap several times...not as good from the bottle, but still a very solid DIPA. Of course, I recommend everyone to drink this...not the best I've ever had, but a great performer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,DrMalt,4.29,From a 650 ml bottle.  Poured a golden yellow with a white thick head. Good lacing & head retention.  Lots of hop aroma with hints of grapefruit & pine.  Taste was definitely hops bitterness upfront but some warming finish from the alcohol. Some earthy flavours coupled with citrus flavours. Less maltiness than other DIPA I have tried.  Mouthfeel came from the gravity (7.7% ABV) and the bitterness on the tongue.  Drinkability was amazingly easy given the higher alcohol. This DIPA was my favourite of our tasting which also included 5 other IPA's.  A very worthwhile IPA.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,joedon,4.2,"This is a big IPA! Served from a bomber printed with the Stone label. Lots of white foam over a yellow-gold beer. Good sticky lace. Big citrusy hop aroma typical of this style. Taste is big too. Starts with a good malt backing and a well balanced hop bitterness. A lot of IBUs but not overwhelming. Medium-bodied mouthfeel is about right for this style. Very drinkable, especially with a deep-dish pizza. Hard to find in the Midwest but worth bringing home.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Normski,4.72,"Amazing. Think Stone's regular IPA, but make the hops more pronounced and incredibly fresh. Obviously lots of hopping at the end. Not overly bitter - the bitterness level stays at the regular IPA level. But, the wonderful taste of hops just dances on your tongue. You can't help to take another swig. Then another. I'm okay with admitting I drank almost a whole growler of this myself. That hop flavor also stays with you long after you swallow. That flavor, plus just the right carbonation level and and ever-persistent head make for an unbeatable combination.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,deathonthemounta,4.2,"22 oz. bomb-diggety into a 22 oz. Weizen glass.  A -- Liquid gold, w/ a slightly orange black hills tint. Very appealing, albeit lighter than I prefer. Sweet little light ivory colored head: a finger or so. Nice lacing, it stays around and keeps you company like an old dog named Jake. Holy Toledo, is that a hop mermaid in there!?  S -- erm...I didn't spend a lot of time smelling, I remember floral hops, but didn't take notes on the sniff.  T -- Nice bitter tongue bite, not too acrid. Initial alcoholic flavor, a piney floral hop bounce swells about midway through. the dominant flavor was some sort of vaguely fruity melon citrus. The citrus was more lightly stated than you usually get in an IPA. Flavors are subtle and you have to concentrate to perceive the understated malt character dominated by the large breasted Hop Maiden, but there is much there to find if you concentrate. Mildly toasty and sweet, reminiscent of a freshly baked sugar cookie. Maybe a little flash of vanilla, and a bit of peppery spice towards the end with even a touch of banana mixed in there. This is only after it warms of course, and then you get a slight warm boozy taste that helps bring it all together.  M -- Better than I thought it would have. It has a nice mouthfeel, but not overly so. It was especially noticeable if you let it sit on your tongue in the back of your throat.  My other top pick of High IBU IPAs, Wildcat IPA, isn't as complex and has more acrid bitterness, but it is a sweet song of the hop flower none the less.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,demcorhip,4.12,"Thanks to raider for bringing this treat back from cali and sharing it on our IPA session night a couple of months back. Was good stuff.  Appearance Amber hued ale poured with an offwhite head. Lightly carbonated, once the head settled down it left fine yet intricate lacings inside the pint glass.  Aroma Floral, earthy, and big bitter hops with the aroma of grapefruit and pine overtop of biscuity malts with just a hint of caramel sweetness.  Taste This is a very good, classic example of the american DIPA. Dry biscuity malts with just a hint of caramel sweetness, but the emphasis is on the bitter yet fruity hops that blast the palate with citrus, tropical fruit, and some pine.  Mouthfeel Good malt backbone in this medium bodied brew, but balancde definately tilted to the hops with their awesome, lingering, resinous bitterness.  Drinkability Definately drinkable/sessionable brew for the hop heads out there. Highly recommended for someone looking for a tasty hop treat. Definately not recommended for someone who doesnt like a lingering, resinous, hop blast. Will gladly drink again, hurry up and get distributed in northwest wisconsin!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

A: Color is of sourwood honey with thick ample foamy head that dissolves into lingering lace. S: Very bitter and hoppy with a strong ginlike juniper berry aroma. T: Grassy and herbal with hops punch throughout. The IBUs tick off with each sip. M: Nice viscosity and palate immersion. medium bodied with nice enduring feel. D: Excellent flavor but a big beer that is best sampled in moderation. Nice option for pairing a bottle with dinner.

Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a copper-orangish color with a nice two finger sudsy head. The smell is a hop lover's dream. A range of hop smells from sweet and citrusy to floral and piney. Truly a treat for the nose. Taste is surprisingly sweet, nicely balanced with the intense hops. The alcohol does come through slightly in the aftertaste and has a very dry finish. This is a full bodied beer with little carbonation. This is a drinkable beer, but I think the dry alcohol finish is not overly desirable. Not a bad beer otherwise though, worth trying if you love hops.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

No freshness dating.  app: pours a hazy golden orange tinged body below a thick egg shell white head. with consideration of the amount of hops in this brew this is the expected look.  smell: Surprisingly subdued, so I suspect this bottle has suffered the rigors of time and travel, I got some earthy minty hops in the nose, some tropical fruits and caramel sweetness (oxidized?), some doughy fresh bake bread. Not entirely off putting, but certainly not anticipated.  taste: plenty of pleasant welcome bitterness that meshes with a nice sweet bready malt character, some tinges of alcohol, plenty of earthy spice hop still detectable in the finish. Again not off putting, but not near expectation. I think this beer probably ages interestingly, and I will need to compare with as fresh a glass as possible.  mouthfeel: nice medium body with good carbonation, finish is dry but slightly sweet, even at what I am assuming to be an aged bottle there is a really pleasant and robust bitterness in this brew.  drinkability: at what I perceive to be an aged stage for this beer it still has a lot of nice characteristics, I am sure at a fresher stage it really hits the mark of an American DIPA,",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,zuggy9,4.5,"A thing of beauty and it'll ruin you for most, this is the IPA of champions. It pours a nice copper amber, with a good head. The aroma is pour hop heaven (or hell). It's not over the top, just right for a seasoned hop head. The taste is intense, and very bitter, like a mugging, but by a bunch of sexy ladies. There is some malt, but it's just a pale glimmer to the heap of hoppiness. It has an excellent mouthfeel, not heavily carbonated, but just right.

It poured about two fingers of head, that was nice and white and fluffy. It had medium retention. The color of the body was a nice amber that was cloudy toward the top. The smell was a citrus hop. The taste had a nice spicy bite to it. The mouthfeel was very smooth, yet not thick. A wonderful brew. Don't drink and review.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,pkaeding,3.97,"It pours from the bottle with a lot of white head, which subsides pretty quickly. The beer itself is very clear, light-amber in color.  I took my first smell, and the citrus-grapefruit I had prepared myself for hit first. My mouth began to water.  However, I took another sniff, and I detected some definite phenol band-aid aromas. For this reason, I marked the aroma score down considerably. Unfortunately, I could not ignore it for my subsequent sips. Of course, the hop aromas are more powerful, but the phenol is right behind them.  Band-aids aside, the flavor is very good. This is a medium-bodied beer, with a lot of bitterness (the label says 100+ IBUs). The bitter finish lingers for about 30 seconds; it is delicious.  I don't know if I just got a bad bottle from a bad batch, or what. Generally, phenols come from a bacterial infection due to poor sanitation. Given other reviews, I would definitely try this again, and hopefully it will be better.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Smell is that of yummy citrusy hops...a lot of grapefruit, lemon peel, orange, and pine. Taste is only slightly malty at first, the a rush of hop flavor and then a smack of bitterness. I don't think I would drink this beer that often. Don't get me wrong, its very good for what it is...but I'd rather stick to barleywines.

Smells floral and citrusy - actually, that really understating it. This smells delicious. Tastes like grapefruit upfront with a hoppy kick in the middle and a malty finish. This is very complex all the way around, but oh so tasty. Nothing wrong with the flavor - it is very bitter, though (which is a good thing!). There is a little too much carbonation here - it's a minor complaint, but nonetheless - it negatively effects the mouthfeel. This is a very drinkable DIPA, if you don't mind the bitterness. Highest Recommendation.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The relatively thick syrupy body leads me to believe this is a few months old, but it's strength has held it up just fine, as it has plenty of carbonation to cut through. Hoppy and resiny, but not very bitter. Fruity, simply bursting with fresh cut red mangoes; they're all over the nose and taste. Fruity hop aftertaste you can smell for minutes. Perfect sized ale body. Very good double IPA. Cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,GbVDave,4.47,"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a 20oz imperial pint.  A: Pours a clear amber-orange color. One finger head that dissolves to a faint skim that leaves plenty of sticky lace on the glass.  S: Smells like when you cut your own Scotch Pine christmas tree and pine sap oozes out of the tree trunk. I also catch the slightly sweet aroma of ripe Bartlett pears.  T: Wonderfully pungent flavors of pine and citrus. The warmer it gets, the more a balancing malt aspect takes hold. The malt adds a fantastic bready quality.  M: Bitter and puckery yet tempered by the considerable malt balance, this sucker is very balanced. Smooth and spicy, rounded and prickly.  D: At 7.7% abv the alcohol content seems pretty low for a DIPA. This translates to an easy drinkability that means you can just sit back, relax, and let the complexities of the beer wash through your mouth. The alcohol flavors are inobtrusive and do not detract from anything going on here. Excellent.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

T: At first taste citrus and pine hops tickle the tongue. Malts balance this beer perfectly. A very earthy or tree bark like finish with an alcohol bite.  M: Very smooth for the style. Well carbinated and slightly drying.  D: I'm a Ruination fan for life. A very clean, refreshing beer and wickedly drinkable. The 7.70 ABV is noticeable but not cloying in any fashion.

147,4083,PhiloPsych,4.65,"This is a beautiful, perfectly crafted beer. The color is clear orange copper. The head is thick and bubbly and lasts to the bottom of the glass leaving white lacing all the way down. The aroma is wonderful, hoppy and sweet. This is exactly how beer should smell! The mouthfeel isn't the least bit watery or thin. I can't say the taste is complex, but it is perfectly balanced and absolutely flawless. Other beers--even high quality beers--with about the same alcohol content are more noticeably alcoholic, the alcohol here is tucked away nicely and only shows up as a lingering euphoria after the beer is gone. Stone crafts their beers perfectly and this is a great example of their work.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,lordofthewiens,4.23,"A 22oz bottle . This beer was an orange color with a medium head. Hops in the nose, all flowery and woodsy. A hoppy taste, but not as aggressive as I expected. The label said &gt;100 IBUs, but I thought it was a pretty smooth ride. Substantial, but not overbearing mouthfeel. A nice beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jeffjfindley,4.35,"Oh golly, another great offering from Stone. At this point I don't think that Steve Wagner is capable of producing a single drop of beer that is less than stellar. This isn't my favorite, but it's damn good.  By Stone standards, there is nothing truly extraordinary about this beer. It's just damn good. The pour is a cloudy orange with a two finger head, which lacks in retention. The smell is of pine and citrus, and the taste follows suit, achieving an admirable balance. Despite the 100+ IBU's, I don't find this to be overly bitter. This is not to say that she doesn't pack a mean tingle, it's just that the caramel malt presence softens it perfectly. The mouthfeel is alive, and wonderful.  On the label it says that Ruination ""rose from the ashes of the Stone Anniversary beers"" and that isn't hard to believe. It's not as complex, but it has the same sort of character, just toned down a bit. This results in a superbly drinkable offering from one of the best damn breweries to ever grace the planet.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Frozensoul327,3.87,"A: Bright orange pumpkin color with a lively head of white foam. Lots of lace. Medium level of carbonation. Nearly crystal clear, like a sunny day at the beach.  S: Light sweet citrus notes of grapefruit and sour orange. Raw hops, a mild earthy fruit rind character. Nice.  T: Not over-the-top, as I was expecting, but good nonetheless. Sweet hops and light seaweed, with a mildy tart note of citrus fruit. Blends well, resulting in a pleasured palate.  M: Mild carbonation soothes the tongue, and the brew rolls down quite easy. Some oily character from the hops. Kind of sticky mouthfeel after the beer is gone.  D: For what the beer lacks in taste, it makes up for in drinkability. The 7.70 % ABV is non exsistant, and I want more right now. Interesting take on the DIPA style. Recommended drinking.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,daliandragon,4.27,"Pours a cloudy light amber with decent thickness and retention in the head and plenty of lacing. The nose is piney and hoppy but not offensively so, as prophecied on the back label. Body is cloudy with sediment.  Very bitter and satisfying but keeps up a constant steady assault instead of that initial, face puckering explosion you get with some DIPAs. Piney with some late citrus and hints of alcohol. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and complements the hops as opposed to covering them. Smooth, wet, finish.  A very tasty and well made DIPA. Absolutely worthy of the Stone moniker of excellence. Very glad I finally got to try it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mhaugan,4.13,"The first thing I have noticed about all of the Stone beers I have tried is that it starts with a huge head and wonderful lacing. They have this down pat. The fragrance is very piney. The flavor is more complex, with hops and pine backing. This beer screams of summer to me, and is pretty much my drink of choice around the grill. The flavor opens up as it warms and with summer grilling in Phoenix this is a big plus. The only downside to this beer is that it does ruin you taste buds. Another reason I like this when I am grilling something with big flavor that can punch through.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Mdog,4,"Appearance: Deep gold, a little hazy, with a big head and plenty of lacing.  Smell: Mostly piney.  Taste: Piney, bitter hoppiness. Got a little citrus hoppiness partway through the bomber.  Mouthfeel: Long lasting bitterness.  Drinkability: Not a really high ABV but you will feel it.  Ordered some Ruination online to fill my refrigerator with DIPAs. This is a solid DIPA and one of the early leaders in the style. It's tasty and good for your hop jones. I must be getting more numb to hops, 100+ IBUs and I say ""it's hoppy, but not really super bitter!""",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mikesgroove,4.42,"Pours a deep cloudy orange with a small creamy head that quickly faded but left a bit of lace. Smell was hoppy heaven! Pine and strong citrus overtones are really all you can smell. The taste was right behind, just up in your face hops! Truly a DIPA if I have ever had one. Not as strong on the alcohol as some others which made this much more drinkable, which could be a problem with the high ABV. Could drink this everyday, truly a great beer and another treasure from Stone!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jmc44,3.97,"Pours a hazy orange color; off-white thick head that dissipates to a fine layer and leaves a nice lacing on the glass.  Aroma is strong of citrusy hops; lemon and grapefruit like. Hidden behind the hop punch is hint of malty sweetness.  Taste is similar to smell, pronounced on the hops, not at all balanced with the malts (as to be expected).  The beer is a bit oily in feel, not quite thick. I found it fairly easy to finish the 22.  While I found this to be a very good, quality beer, I was also disappointed. After reading the rear label, boasting about how this brew will essentially kill your tastebuds due to its obscene hoppiness, I actually found the hop characteristics to be a bit weak. Not the ""ruination"" and obliteration of taste that I had expected.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Backer2004,4.55,"Another beer sitting in the cellar that finally came out a few nights ago. Everyone at the Carolina Brewmasters flocked to this beer when I opened it up. I'm very glad I shared because although it's truly excellent in so many ways, it's difficult to finish or even get halfway through. Probably one of the hoppiest beers I can recall but just a fantastic style from a fanatastic brewery. Definitely need to pick some more up.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,MuenchenerKindl,4.63,"Poured from a big bomber to a pint glass. The liquid was oh so thick with malt that carbonation looked to be in slow motion. The head was 2 fingers thick off white and left nice lace.  The smell was very good big piney hops, and lots of big sweet malt to boot.  The taste followed well, Big hopy bitter but well balanced my a huge sweet malt. Wow this is the stuff.  The mouthfeel it great big and thick full body and great carbonation.  The drinkability is also very good, I could go on drinking. No need to stop. Prosit Mk",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,MVassar,4.8,"Simply an amazing beer. Get your hands on this one.  Gorgeous red/orange raw honey color. Surprisingly clear. Ample foamy head which looks like whipped French vanilla ice cream. Beautiful lacing.  Plenty of hops, pine, and citrus in the nose. Really jumps out at you.  Not a heavy beer, but loaded with flavor. Medium body, but oh what a body. Nothing cloying about this one, (unlike the Vertical Epic,) which is impressive, considering the amount of depth. Wonderful malty sweetness balanced with a sturdy backbone of bitter hops. Tastes of burnt sugar, citrus, (grapefruit peel?), and a huge amount of spicy hops.  Very smooth. Feels great in the mouth, with lively carbonation, and a rich, oily texture.  Drinkability? Well, this one could certainly be the ruin of me. One of the most pleasurable beer drinking experiences I've ever had.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,sstackho,4.46,"22oz bottle. Pours a light golden straw, with little carbonation and no head. Beautiful aroma of floral hops. First taste is a bit of a surprise, in that I am not being bowled over by sweetness and hops - but I love it! My only other Stone experience was the Stone 10th Anniversary - and that one did bowl me over with hops. This one is very hoppy - don't get me wrong - but it's much better balanced than I was expecting. It goes down the throat perfectly and leaves a wonderful hoppy aftertaste that keeps on giving. Some of the extreme American beers have been too sweet for my untested Canadian palate, but this one is really very, very nice.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,tcfishler,3.85,"Medium orange-amber with a short-lived white head.  Aromas are grassy-hoppy.  Mouthfeel is not very chewy but is incredibly oily. Hops are grassy/herbaceous in character, and they strike me as more drying than bitter. This beer really dries out the palate. Subtle sweetness pokes its head through the hops just before the finish, which is dry but not unpleasantly bitter. Alcohol is apparent only in a good way; it sweetens the beer and gives it excellent body, without creating any unpleasant heat or sharpness.  A big herbal mouthful of hops, but not as complex or bitter as advertised.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jwc215,4.37,"Pours hazy orange with a thick head that leaves some lacing. The head remains at a thin, consistent layer.  The smell is an onslaught of fresh citrus. Lemon, orange, grapefruit, and some earthy dough all coime out.  The taste is of chewy, bitter hops. There is a nice complexity of a variety of citrus and floral hops - orange, lemon, grapefruit all intertwine. An earthy, bready flavor is mixed in to give it more than complexity. A dose of malt keeps it all together. There is an on-again, off-again alcohol kick to give it some spice. Sure, it's not ""well-balanced"", but that's the point, isn't it? The hop character keeps this one going....The finish is not quite as bitter as I was expecting, but the flavor lingers...  The feel is full (just a tad more fuller and this treat would be absolutely perfect), rich and creamy. Silky smooth...  This one rings in at 100+ IBU's. Want a hoppy beer? Well, here you go...But, it does have enough malt and yeast that the hops aren't all over the place. A wonderfully hoppy treat! As nice as it is, though, it is a bit ""over-the-top"" and serves as an occassional hop-treat! I definately recommend trying - esp. if you're a ""hop-head""!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,NEhophead,4.47,"1pt 6 fl oz brown bottle; Served in an oversized wine glass.  Glowingly hazy peach in color with golden highlights. Pillowy, creamy white head that fades to a whispy sheet after a moment. Spotted lacing with pretty good stick.  Bright, juicy hop oils practically jumping out of the glass. A bouquet of pine, pineapple, pear, and apricot that mix well with a soothing, warm alcohol presence. The creamy malt character is delicate, but quite noticeable, offering hints of vanilla and honey.  Lively, intense hop presence right off the bat: moderate citrus flavors with a bright, gritty pine. The yeast is felt with a slight mustiness that follows the intense hops. The honey-flavored, balanced malt mingles with a mellow alcohol character giving a braggot-esque taste. A dark, bold bitterness is followed by an aftertaste of aged fruit, oak, and pine.  Medium in body; light flavor profile, but a complex texture to match the intensity of each flavor component. Smooth, gritty; wonderfully balanced considering this 100 IBU hop monstrosity.  Stone certainly doesn't disappoint here. Very complex in flavor, holding nothing back. A must try for hopheads, but not for the uninitiated.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mmcave,4.5,"Poured into wine glass, despite the vessel the head is a foamy white color, with nice lacing. The body is a thick purpley maple syrup color, almost mahogany. Smells of subtle floral scents from the hop's contribution. The malt seems to take a wonderfully supportive role, balancing the lush hop presence. Some grape fruit, pine, citrus even toasty notes. The taste is much the same, with notes of toasted barely, subtle sweet malt, tons of refreshing hops. It's a dry, floral start, matched with mild sweet malt, the finish is the best very refreshing, second only to wonderful burps. This definitely lets the hop take over, in my favorite double IPAs there is a bit more sweet malt, but this is still a kick ass brew. Undoubtedly drinkable and worth a try.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,bigone4,4.2,Pours a bright hazy orange similar to a darker straw color. Massive frothy off-white head that dissipates rather quickly. Leaves great lacing present down the whole glass. No freshness mark found on the bottle. Great definition and explanation for the making of this beer on the back of the screen printed 22oz bottle. Always prove to make me smile. Great appearance gives way to a very impressive bouquet of hop florals and citrus tones. There is a slight sharpness in the nostrils with a mild hint of a caramel like malt flavor but mostly oily hop tones. Very floral and you know it has a fierce hop presence.  Taste was rather piney and sharp mix of different hop flavors. Massive flow of hop flavor but equally buttery and citrusy at the same time. Nice mix of hop flavors overwhelmed my palate. I knew what I was getting into but not for the faint hop experience. This beer brings the hop bite. Nice flow of hop tones from start to finish. Very floral and citrusy at first and then trails off to a nice dry hop finish. Mild hint of malt somewhere lost in the back ground. This beer has a tasty and refreshing hop flavor that is surprisingly tolerable. 100+ IBU count is very much there and blends very well throughout the beer. It is has an enjoyable hop taste that really does take over the pallet. If you were eating any dinner it may not taste the same after this beer. You may want to savor this selection alone. It is very well constructed and enjoyable not an overpowering smash in the mouth hop flavor. It is a controlled anarchy of hop fusion. Great brew with a good drinkability. This one is certainly worth a try any day of the week.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,scruffwhor,4.32,"Great honey/ambrosia color. Great, bright white head that slowly dissipates to bright layer of foam. The foam is kept intact by the plume of great bubbles rising to the top of the brew. And sheer magic makes that heavenly foam stick to the sides of my glass. Great malty, hop juicey aroma meld together in my nostril cavity. Mkaes me think of mommas biscuits melded with fresh wild flowers and citrus zest. The a great medium hop allure makes a malty melange of strong bitter and bready malt.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,largadeer,4.28,"22 oz bottle poured into a Stone IPA glass.  Appearance: Honey-colored with a fluffy white head that leaves behind a ton of sticky lace.  Smell: Spicy, resiny hops and little else. The fresh pine aroma is absolutely huge.  Taste: The taste closely follows the nose with a massive resiny hop flavor attacking the palate from the get-go. It sits on your tounge with a piney, oily, intensely hoppy taste, but the finish is smooth and even somewhat malty. Unexpectedly smooth, and even pretty mellow. Very enjoyable.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, crisp, and very smooth.  Drinkability: One of the most drinkable double IPAs out there. Too strong to session, but not so strong that you couldn't easily enjoy a pint or two.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,SilentSabre,4.2,"Poured a medium orange honey colour with a great looking thick snow white head. Great head retention as it hung around for several minutes. Sticky, glue-like lacing on the edges of my glass. Looks good. Smell is about what I expected with the West Coast style citrusy hops. What I didn't expect, however, was a touch of malty sweetness in the nose. Smell seems very well balanced. I wish there was a 4.75, because I would certainly use it for taste on this one. The citrusy hops are, of course, present in the taste, but there is a very evident spicy / peppery ""kick"" that I have never before noticed in any beer. The hops hit your taste buds first, with a well balanced hop/malt middle, and then a quick pepper-like sensation. Nice. Very nice. Mouthfeel is quite nice, but I can see where this beer might be too assertive for some people. I actually liked this more than I thought I would. Thanks to Ding for bringing this to me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,umfskibum,4.68,"A: Thick and foamy head. Orange-tinged gold body. Decent, attractive carbonation and good lacing.  S: Flowery hops and various citrus, particularly orange and grapefruit. Very sweet.  T: A lot of people have waxed poetic about this beer, but I don't think I can do it justice. Suffice to say the taste is simply astounding. Hops, sweet malts, and alcohol are all present in the flavor, but the hops truly dominate.  M: Creamy, almost buttery texture. Smooth from the rim of the glass right down to your stomach.  D: Definately a one-off beer, the hops are just as pronounced as Stone brags. But it is without a doubt a beer I will return to again and again.  Notes: I won't lie, I was skeptical of this beer living up to the expectations set by many beer lovers and BAs. Once again, BeerAdvocate has proven to be a source to be trusted. This beer astounded me with its balanced, nuanced flavor. Definately a benchmark for the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,RedHaze,4.42,"Pours a very attractive orange tinged copper with a one finger head that slowly fades to a thin cap. The lacing that's behind is much thicker than I expected.  Smell; lots of piney, resiny hops. There's a pretty good amount of citrus flavors, as well as some grassy and floral aromas. Some sweet malts come through in the background.  Taste; the malts have a much more significant presence in the taste than they did in the smell, but by no means are they the dominant flavor. They do however provide just enough sweetness to balance out the hops a little. The hops are the big players here with pine resin, citrus herbal flavors. In the finish there's a little bit of herbal quality. Very nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice smooth natural carbonation, an the drinkability is out of this world. I could drink this stuff all night long. This is the best double IPA I've had in a while.  I picked this bottle up, as well as a couple others, on my recent trip to Michigan. Can't wait till my next trip so that I can pick up some more of this, and Arrogant Bastard.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The nose is all about a huge wave of hops, strong alcohol aroma, and a big grapefruit aroma, although not as much as some other IPAs... Tastes of full force hops, grapefruit, citrus peel. Fairly bitter, but definitely drinkable. A tad too much alcohol for me. Perfect amount of creamyness, sweetness, and carbonation. For a huge beer, this is drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,cheers2beers,4.07,"Appearance: This beer poured a bright orange hue with a relatively small white head. A few columns of beading can be found as well as a minimumal amount of laceing.  Smell: The aromas are surprisingly sweet, sharp and yet balanced. Non-offensive and very pleasing piney resinous wafts make their way into my nose.  Taste: The flavors consist of a light piney hops, sour orange peels, a pleasant sweet maltiness. Maybe its me,but this does not taste like 100+ IBUs as posted on their bottle. A slight breadiness is detected towards the finish, followed by a light alcohol fume. Not as heavily hopped as I had anticipated, but still a quaffable delight.  Mouthfeel: This is very thin and light for a DIPA. Sticky from the hop oils, and slightly fizzy on the tongue. Medium amount of carbonation.  Drinkability: This beer is a truely nice brew, but it was too hyped up, and did not meet the expectations that I had dreamed of. Dont get me wrong this is very quaffable, just not life changing.

Notable I did not really enjoy this brewery's regular IPA.  despite this very nice nose, I am underwhelmed by the taste. something rather bitter and a bit skunky rises to meet me, the citrus-like hop profile from the nose, while still notable in smell, is not the dominant aspect of this beer. After similar notes in the normal stone IPA I wonder if they are using a hop which is prone to tasting like this. given the IBU profile of this beer maybe all of this is normal, or my palate is more sensitive than most, though I enjoy many double IPA's normally.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jasonjlewis,3.98,"apperance: pale yellow golden color. thcik head that stays for a long long time.  Smell: citrus hops, like all IPAs. Not as strong as I want for adouble IPA.  Taste: A nice smack in the ass, not a total kick to the ass. Very very hoppy. Bitterness level is very very high. Very mild malt flavor on the top of the tongue. Very assertive hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel: crisp but thin.  Drinkability: Could use a little more malt flavor as one area of the tongue is going crazy and the other ones aren't involved as much. But double IPAs are supposed to be like that. I personally love it as other ipa lovers seem to. Only drink this beer if you are a hopy lover. I wish this was sold in texas, because if it was I would have it in my fridge at all times.  My taste buds were numb for a long time after this beer. I could taste NOTHING after this beer was done.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,SwillBilly,4.65,"22 oz classic Stone bottle with gargoyle on front and Ruination story on back.  Appearance: Pours light amber in color and crystal clear. Tiny bubbles of carbonation stream to the surface. A fluffy 2 finger head tops Ruination then ever so slowly fades leaving sheets of sticky lacing lining the tulip.  Smell: Wow, big, citrusy, grapefruity hops explode out of the glass with just a hint of fruitiness thrown in for good measure. Has an underlying sweetness that tries to breakthrough the hop aroma.  Taste: Big, juicy hops dominate the beginning with grapefruit rind, orange peel and pine. The middle is more of those fantastic hops but the malt tries to break through with just a touch of a candy like sweetness. A fruitiness is also present with shades of ripe apricots trying to balance out the hops but its a losing battle as the hops come out on top in the finish. Citrusy hop bitterness linger on the tongue well after the swallow leaving the mouth dry and begging for more. Alcohol is well hidden in the flavor profile but its warming effects are felt on the face. Fantastic.  Mouthfeel: Medium mouthfeel with a crisp and dry finish. Borderlines on being slick and creamy at the same time. Carbonation is spot on.  Drinkability/Notes: It about time I got around to reviewing Ruination. I've had this beer more times than I can count and it never ceases to amaze. A hop heads delight. Big time citrusy hops dominate but the malts do make an effort to bust through just enough to make things interesting with a fruity/candy like sweetness in the middle. Definitely one of my favorite DIPA's, not as sweet as most with a rather dry finish which I really like. If it wasn't for the 7.7% abv I could put these back all night. Just an outstanding beer in my opinion regardless of style. If you haven't had the pleasure to try Ruination, seek out and enjoy. Another fantastic beer from the folks at Stone.

147,4083,joe1510,4,"22oz. Bomber  I've been anxious to try this. I can't get it here in IL so I picked some up in Indiana a couple weeks ago.  Poured into a snifter. When I cracked the lid on this it smelled just like I'd broken open a handful of hops. Poured a bright orange that almost glowed when held to the light. A generous white bubbly head sits up top and doesn't look to be going anywhere anytime soon. Small clumps of lacing as I drink.  The smell is really appetizing. I actually pick up more malt than I thought I was going to. There is a caramel like sweetness in the distance but hop oils take front stage. A strong but not overwhelming pine freshness.There is also unsweetened grapefruit that makes my mouth water.  This one will briefly give you bitter beer face from the 100+ IBU's that Ruination boasts. When the beer first hits the palate the caramel maltiness comes through just to establish itself. By mid-palate you find yourself chewing a mouthful of pine needles with a couple squeezes of grapefruit juiced dribbled along the top. Hop oils coat the entire mouth. The bitterness hits at the swallow and lingers till the next drink.  Mouthfeel is slightly syrupy. On the heavier side of medium bodied. Thick and coating. I love the mouth numbing effect from the huge amount of hops.  The drinkability suffers a little bit from the syrupy mouthfeel and the mouth numbing. It would be easier to drink more but I'd almost hate to because I wouldn't be able to get the full flavor out of it.  Overall Ruination is one impressive IIPA from Stone. On the back of the bottle it states ""so called because of the immediate ruinous effect on your palate"". They weren't kidding either. Give this a try if you see it. It's an enjoyable expierence.  Slainte!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,CortexBomb,4,"I am thrilled that this stuff is finally available in Michigan...  Pour, beauitful, great looking. Perfect golden/orange colouration (no cloudiness) with a nice, 2 inch thick white head on top of my imperial pint. The smell of hops is noticeable a full foot back from the beer, and the floral goodness is even better when you get up close to it.  Hops, as expected, take over early with pine and floral notes constantly trading spots. Grapefruit shows up in the middle and the whole affair is nicely accentuated by a creamy fullness. The variety and power of the different hop flavours is great here, it's not as overpowering as some of the big IPA or IIPA's, but the full range is there and in force. Great bitter on the finish, and then a strong lingering aspect. Good stuff!  The mouth on this, bitters exactly where you'd expect them, and then some. The creamy, full aspect of the mouth on this bumps this beer to good. Drinkability, also rock solid, no problem drinking this one.  The bottom line: if you like IPA's, Ruination is a fine thing to have in your pint glass. A strong, varied hop presence, and an overall solid beer all the way through.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,tempest,4.33,"For some stupid reason, I came into this beer determined to find faults, thinking it was some how over-rated. I was dead wrong.  Ruination has an orange body with a fluffy head of fine bubbles. Youre met with a powerful, pungent aroma of sweet fruits and earthy, floral hops. Tastes of caramel and toasted malt overrun by bitter mixed citrus juice and lemon peel with tangerine and pine flavor fading out before the long-lingering herbal bitterness kicks in. Feels rich and smooth for such bitterness, invites another sip. A bit tart too.  Upon emptying the bottle, I wish I had another. This would also be an amazing beer to pair with sharp, bold, and spicey foods. God damn its good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Aroma, pour and mouthfeel are all similar to the IPA, and at first the taste was indiscernable from it. That qiuickly changed as the hops took over my tongue and would not let go. Was very impressed as the hops seemed to grow in strength even after swallowing. Paired perfectly with the tailgating fare available.

147,4083,xav33,4.28,"Stone Ruination IPA 22oz bomber Recent bottling, palate ruined 10/06 Medium pour in a tulip glass  Poured clear amber with a big whiteish frothy mostly lasting head with good lacing.  Smelt strongly of pine, moderate fruity oranges and slight dewey yeast.  Taste was upfront strong bitter, light sweet grapefruity character followed by a harsh bitter hop bite with a light clover honey sweetness and light doughiness on a finish that clings on the palate forever, with the bitterness morphing into a hodgepodge of hop flavors, such as flowery, perfumey, lemoney, grassy, piney. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, watery, soft caressing carbonation, with strong astringency and light cozy alcoholic warmth.  Overall, this is the most delicate and flawless presentation of hops in a double IPA I've had so far. The bite is there, but softened and enlivened by the lightness on the palate and light sweet malt backbone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Osiris9588,4.7,"22oz bomber graced by a Stone gargoyle and acerbic Stone saracasm, bravado, and hyperbole. Poured into a Delirium Tremens flared snifter, the color is pale honey with bronze and gold undertones. The white three-finger head is creamy and firms up nicely, demonstrating solid retention and copious strands of sticky lacing. A vortex of bubbles races up through the center.  The nose is spicy, fragrant, and floral, lots of hops and a bit of malt. The flavor offers some slightly sweet caramel malt, a slight accent of lemon zest, a whisper of berries in the background, some candied sugar, and a cataclysm of robust hops. The alcohol is masterfully blended into the complex mix.  The mouth is bold and complex, beginning light, sweet, and gently malty on the front, ending in a dry and bitter hoppiness on the back palate, yet a bright lemony/sugary note dances on the lips before finally decaying-- great carbonation and liveliness. The hops are intense, but is still exceptionally well balanced with the wide array of flavors and textures.  I can drink this all night. It truly is ""a liquid poem to the glory of the hop!""",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,nortmand,4.7,"Pours light amber with a full, stiff white head that leaves nice lace.  Initial hop aroma is citrus, a bit of durian then leads it into a resiny pine hoppiness. Hops. Hops.  Spicy sweetness up front quickly turns into oily resinous flavors. Leaves a huge lingering bitterness on the back of the tongue for a long time.  Medium bodied and surprisingl;y smooth and drinkable. No detectable alcohol, just hop juice deliciousness.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,DaPeculierDane,4.47,"I was worried that I had left this in my cellar too long but damn it still delivers even after 6 months. The pine resin is so damn aromatic and delicious. Butter toast and caramel follow. Rich and creamy, very bitter. Grapefruit enters too. Light on the carbonation, thick bodied. Brilliant orange color. Super drinkable. Super rich. This is just a fantastic brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ByTor2112,4.25,"Poured a nice darker golden color. An off white head forms then gets very thin. A few spots of lace linger. My sinuses are stopped up-dammit! I do get a very pungent hop aroma, a grassy herbal hop aroma is there. First sip is nothing but hops, an astringent bitterness. Not as brutal as I expected, it is still rather cold though. This IPA definitely has a hop profile to the max. Hard to get any of the malt to come through. I've had IPA's that are all hops with thin malt backbones, this IS NOT the case, just having a hard time getting through to it. A vigorous froth sweetens it up. Ah, there it is, the malt is revealed. I also get citrus hop characteristics coming through now also. As I sip and drink, I ask myself where's the punch I keep hearing about. Then, I start to get this feeling in my mouth. The feeling like I've been chewing on high Alpha Acid hop pellets! This is only my second Stone brew and I was expecting some kind of unruly hop knock-out. The after-bitterness is very distinct. As this IPA warms, the hop-numb becomes a little more pronounced. The huge amount of hops are almost layered, they do not jump right out in one big hop-smack. I am impressed with Stone and will continue to drink their brews. Cheers",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,PorterLambic,4.39,"Pours a nice amber/dark golden color. Fluffy, orange-tinted light tan head 2"" deep. Head drops slowly and evenly but leaves no lace. Smell is amazing! Hops, citrus, floral, green grapes, malt, alcohol, a resin note reminescient of evergreens, a wonderful and completely unexpected sour/sweet blend that is very lambic-like, a note of dryness and smokiness as well. Amazing complexity and balance. Taste has good balance and great complexity with hops, floral, alcohol and resin, with hints of citrus, smoke and malt. The 7.7% ABV is very noticeable in the aftertaste but less so in the actual tasting. Medium body but leaning towards full. The hop/floral aftertaste lingers forever. Lightly effervescent. Though I am in no way a hop-head, I loved this brew! It is great, period.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,rarevos,4.52,"Poured from bomber into pint glass.  A: Pours a hazy orange-amber with no real head--just a bit of wispy lacing at first that becomes a few bubbles around the perimeter of the glass.  S: Citrus (grapefruit, lemon zest) up front with a bit of pineyness. Can make out a good bit of sweet malt as well. This smells rich, powerful, and appetizing.  T: Holy Jeebus. I really wasn't prepared for the first swallow, and it totally overwhelmed me. This is NOT just a hop bomb. There's a great malt backbone with some sweet and smoky caramel mixed with something like peach nectar. Some great hoppiness after that that features some citrus zest and some grapefruit juice. Finish is long, bitter, and piney, though there's a floral quality mixed in with the pineyness. The peach nectar quality also shows up for the encore.  M: A bit slick at first, finishes dry.  D: Oh, man. This is good stuff, and I think this is the first 5 I've ever given for drinkability. The best thing about this beer (to a non-hophead, at least) is that it's VERY well-balanced. There are many flavors and aromas being highlighted here, so it doesn't just taste like someone dropped an entire hop farm into a kettle. Yes, there's a pretty powerful bitterness, but there are citrus, woody, and floral aromas/flavors all playing nice with one another to round it out. Delicious. Applause, accolades, etc.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BlackJeremiah,4.2,"Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a Stone 10th pint glass.  A: Golden in color, 1.5"" head. Thick, foamy, with lacing all around the glass. Looks delectable.  S: Lots of pine, citrus, hop oils, with a slight creamy smell indicating some malt presence. Alcohol scent lurks in the background.  T: Hops assert strongly, oily pine, lemon and orange. Balanced with a muted, but creamy, malt presence. Alcohol flavors weave in and out of this, playfully.  M: Oily, slick and full-bodied. A great feel and presence. Forceful, but not necessarily ruinous.  D: Despite the boasting, this beer is truly well-crafted, and more balanced than its name would lead one to believe.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,lpayette,4.13,"22 oz painted bomber. Claims to have 100+ IBUs.  Appearance- Nearly crystal clear gold color. Fairly big white head with some brussels lace going on.  Smell- At the pop of the cap a huge wave of hops hit me. There's also a strong alcohol aroma. The hops give off a bit of a grapefruit aroma, although not as much as some other IPAs... not sure what variety of hop produces this aroma, but whatever variety it is- it's in this beer.  Taste- The first thing that hits me is a bit of a creamyness- odd. Next come the hops in full force- fairly bitter, yes, but definitely bareable. A bit of citrusy grapefruit is found in the taste as well- I like that, but there is a tad too much alcohol in the taste for me.  Mouthfeel- Perfect amount of creamyness, sweetness, and carbonation. Outstanding  Drinkability- For a huge beer, this is pretty darn drinkable. Maybe a bit of aging to diminish the harshness of the alcohol would make it even better.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,eballard,3.98,This beer pours a heavy amber color with a thick off white foamy head. The lace the head leaves behind covers the whole glass as you drink the beer and acts more like a dollop of whipped cream on the top of the beer then a normal beer head. The beer h a strong sweet aroma that reminds me of over ripe fruit. The taste hits you like a ton of bricks or more like a ton of bricks made out of hops. The hops and the spice covers your whole mouth with a IPA style tingle. The blend is great with only a hint of the normal bitterness. In all the beer is a sweet blend of hops and malt with a strong spice. The beer has a surprisingly crisp refreshing feel and is far smother then other strong IPAs that Ive had. This beer actually finishes very clean and refreshing as far as strong tasting beers go. Youre left with a clean feeling but youll be tasting hops for the rest of the day.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Dewey0603,4.03,"Pours a clear amber/copper color with a giant white foamy frothy head. A very nice looking beer. The smell is a pungent citrus hop aroma. Grapefruit and tangerine are the aromas most dominate. The taste is very bitter,this is crazy hoppy. Citrus flavors are in this beer,but the hop bitterness really dominates. The m/f is medium with the flavors mixing OK. A very good beer that I waited a long time to try. Just remember,it's REAL hoppy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Beerzebub,4.47,"Translucent orange. The off-white head almost disappears, but leaves beautiful lacing like sea foam on a beach.  A complex aroma. Good hop aroma, but not overpowering. Floral and citrus hops, fruit like blackberries, delicious malty sweetness like sugary pie crust, hint of bubblegum. It comes together into a whole greater than the sum of its parts, pure goodness.  Taste has a backbone of hop bitterness. Grapefruit, pine/rosemary, and floral hop flavors. The bitterness is very well balanced with a rich caramel maltiness, with only a bare hint of sweetness. Really, rather dry. Fairly long, hoppy finish, with a clean, minty hint of alcohol.  Rich, oily mouthfeel. Soft, fine carbonation. Eminently drinkable.  This is great stuff. The rare hopbomb that doesn't sacrifice one inch of balance or complexity.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,beveritt,4,"Poured this from a 22oz brown bomber into a standard pint glass. No dates of any kind on the bottle.  Appearance: Light brown in color, with a 2 inch, almost pure white head. The head falls, leaving some lacing and a very thin layer of foam on the beer. The beer itself is orange and fairly hazy.  Smell: Hops, hops, and more hops. Strong floral and citrus smell, specifically orange.  Taste: This beer has layers of hop flavors. I don't know what they used or when they threw it in the boil, but I can easily identify at least 3 different hop flavors. One is citrus, one floral, and then a finishing bitter bite. Just discernible is the underlying malt flavor.  Mouthfeel: Average level of carbonation. Body is very good.  Drinkability: Well, you have to drink at least a bomber of this stuff, but two may be pushing it. A nice beer, but the somewhat high alcohol level may detract from having a couple.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,HogieWan,4.43,"Brown, silk-screened bomber poured into a large snifter.  Beautifully bright copper with a short frothy white head that settles quickly into a ring around the glass, leaving wonderful lacing down to the bottom.  Nose is not as strong as I expected, but it is big enough (expectations killed me here). Lots of things going on - spicy, floral, piney, citrus, woody, tobacco, honey and a touch of tea.  Taste is extremely balanced for 100+ IBUs. How the malt takes over, I don't know, but the malt and hops go back and forth from the time it touches your tongue til two breaths after swallowing. Taste is similar to the aroma and the mouthfeel is medium, soft, and dry at the end.  Drinkibility is scary on this. I could drink a few of these as long as I am able to hold the glass! I definately won't try any other brews after this monster.  Overall, a very wonderful beer. As I am not a hophead, I wasn't expecting to like this. I was almost using it to warm up to my second encounter with an AB I'll be sampling in a few days (I got both of them in a trade).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mikepthe11,4,"After my 1st trip to Ca. this summer, i was a Stone convert, having tasted and enjoyed their regular IPA at several eateries during my vacation...so my expectations were high for this...i was not dissapointed...  ...it poured well into a tall glass from the 22oz bottle...i recommend that you take the time to read the bottle and enjoy the labeling and it's odd, rough texture...once poured, the color is a medium hued golden yellow w/ an ample head...a citral hoppiness fills your nose as you breathe this one in deep...the tatse begins simple enough in your mouth but it's the aftertaste that makes this one worth the effort - not so much bold but still, to the point...the citrus mixes with the hops and thus begins a delicate balance and battle of tatses for your mouth to enjoy as you reach for another sip...at 7.7%, it's certainly more managable than most of your other Double IPAs and it doesn't weigh heavy in your stomach after the bottle is empty either...it breaks the custom of some of the more ""thicker"" tasting Double IPAs...in fact, i find it strange that it's called a DIPA... i feel like it's a 'tweener - somewhere between an IPA and a DIPA...an alltogether fine crafted beer that i'll continue to enjoy...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

A - dark orange / light copper colored, pretty much transparent. two-fingered head that faded pretty quickly but left medium sized bubbles and a nice lace.  S - This smells great. strong, citrusy hops aroma with a twinge of dark caramel and, perhaps, an apple-like alcohol odor  T - To be honest, I was slightly disappointed with the taste of this beer. Subtle and sweet with a good malt core, but the pungency of the citrus hops doesn't come through like in the smell. i guess i wanted a burst of flavor and it came on at a very slow pace. until the finish that is, which is all yummy hops bitterness. i want more of that.  M - pretty well carbonated, medium-bodied. somewhat syrupy at the end, but in a good way. the alcohol really does warm up the back of your throat.

Slowly pours a ghostly goldish copper, sticky looking whitish head. Olfactory confirmation of hop presence. Citrusy, flowery.  Surprisingly smooth, given how the text on the back label talks up how much my tastebuds are going to be razed. And I must have a high IBU tolerance, because I figured 100+ would kick my tongue's ass. Over time, perfume vapors form in my mouth from all the hop action. Breadiness lingers.  If you like hops, you'll like this.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Fugazme,4.54,Light copper in coler... large head after a slow pour. Large and small bubbles that stay and stay.  Aroma is top notch. A superb amount of flowery scents and a perfect balance of maltiness in the nose. Sweet and citrussy. Some great caramel-like aromas abound. Even a touch of chocolate. Wonderful.  Mouthfeel is smooth and slightly dry.  Taste is balanced nicely. Aggresive hops offset with a moderate malt follow-through that takes a sweet slide on the tongue... followed with a more aggresive hop swallow. Very good and easy to drink.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,HoustonTX,4.2,"First off, thanks Ken for giving me the opportunity to try this one. Been yearning for one for quite some time.  Pours a golden orange. Small white head, with small lacing trails lining the glass. Smell has a nice citrus hop quality about it. Mellow, yet grabbing. Taste is a blast of twangy citrus hops. All of this sits on a nicely balanced malt earthy backbone. The hops are not so much bitter, as they are numbing on the palate. Ruination leaves a slight tingle on the tongue, it's quite pleasent. Drinkability is good.  Overall, Ruination has a nice assertive hop profile. Along with a nice malt base. Another solid offering from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The smell is interesting, not what I expected, the hops are there but what is overwelming smells almost like tylenol.  The taste is off the chain, its like the perfict citrus and floral flavored hops, offset with malt and alcohal yet predominantly hoppy.  the beer is so drinkable its crazey I want 3 cases of this stuff. a champion among beer!  revisit... 12/2/09  A: this beer pours a semi opaque golden color. A vigorous pour yields a white head which dissipates fast. Large white bubbles form and leave quite a bit of lacing on their way down.  S: wow this smells sooo good and it has been a while since I have had it. I get a very pungent grapefruit quality. It has a resinous earthy cannabis/humulone quality. Smells amazing actually!  T: This is maybe not the freshest bottle but it's still extremely good. There is a nice pine forest floor quality as well as a sappy resinous feel. I get citrus zest namely grapefruit (probably because its so pungent in the bouquet). Not overbearing but certainly a hophead's delight! Still a great beer and a force to reckon with!  M: Medium body and very strong on the tongue. Somewhat prickly but in the end it has a tacky quality that sticks to the mouth leaving a long finish.  D: for me its very drinkable... the flavor is strong and so higher alcohol is not as noticed. You will need to be a fan of dry finishing bitter beer, but I'm delighted by the lack of caramel sweetness that is so often associated with double IPA's. Still an awesome beer to be",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Smell: syrupy sweet malts and alcohol with powdered aspirin  Taste: again syrupy sweet and tangy hops. Gets a bit better and more complex as it warms, but the weird powdered aspirin bitter taste is still there.  Mouth feel: watery and lacking in carbonation  Drinkability: One is enough... this is a beer everyone should sample once, it is a benchmark for double IPAs and challenged people's expectations, but I feel it has been far surpassed.

147,4083,sopor,3.98,"Brilliantly clear perfectly amber pale ale with a dimpled, uneven, thick bog of off-white foam. Classic pale ale look, unclusing just a few medium paced bubbles. A film lasts, and leaves splotchy lace.  Resinous grapefruit kick to the nose, with hints of a sweet caress of malt afterwards.  Greasy, resinous, sinisterly bitter hops coat the tongue, abrassively washing away all hints of a malt backbone, and leaving only a greasy aftertaste on the back of the tongue, leaving an actually cleaner aftertaste than is expected. After a few drinks, the malts open a bit more... perhaps b/c it's killed all of my bitter-sensing tastebuds, but more likely just due to some warming. Malt is just slightly toasty and dry.  Surprisingly, classic pale ale body and CO2. I expected a heavy body, delciate CO2 like some IIPAs, but this is light and active.

Big hoppy aroma with just a hint of alcohol and an exaggerated malt sweetness.  Flavor is just awesome. Assertive bitterness stabs the tongue. Plenty of green hop burps, lasting dry citrus pith aftertaste. A faint malt sweetness keeps things well-balanced and together.  Reasonable medium body, mild carbonation stays out of the way.

Very nice.  Tastes about the same as it smells with a perfect carbonation, very smooth mouthfeel, and a lingering bitter finish. A true assault on the palate.

A thick off-white head lingered through the entire drink, and left excellent lacing all around the glass. A strong, highly hopped aroma of grapefruit and oranges led the way. Flavor at first was more of bitter hoppiness, combined with the citrus fruit. As the glass warmed, a slight malty sweetness crept into the flavor. Further on, the 7.7% alcohol made itself known in both aroma and the finish, which was a perfect balance of the bitter the sweet.

Smells are fantastic - blooming hops all over the place. Pine. Hints of butterscotch underneath. Very complex character in the aroma, and it continues well into the taste. Crazy hops here that bounce all over. Very floral. The dominating taste is obviously the hops, but there are so many layers to them that I can't describe it as single note. Very nice finish and aftertaste. The hops continue to change and bloom even then. Creamy mouthfeel that complements the hoppy character very well.

Intense bitterness, but surprisingly well balanced. There is a good carmely malt backbone with a bit of sweetness backing up the hops.

A beautiful, clear amber body, but with very little head (maybe too much hop oil to support a head?). Smell is piney and hoppy, but not as hoppy as I expected. The taste is great. A normal american IPA hop zing up front, some malt in the middle, but then a huge bitter bite at the end of the swallow. It's bitter, but still balanced. What a nice beer!

Disapates at a steady rate leaving quite a bit of lacing. Light orange in color, lots of carbonation visible.  S: Smells very similar to their other IPA, very, very hoppy with some citrus notes. Maybe a little maltier than the other.  T: Well as the bottle suggests, this thing is a hop bomb, but it has quite a bit of sweet malt to balance it all out. Both bitter and sweet play along side each other until the finish when the hops pull ahead and completly take over leaving a very, very bitter aftertaste that lingers for a very long long time. Basically picture the Stone IPA with a lot more malt and twice as much hops. Maybe a little overbored.  M: Incredibly smooth. For as big and bad as it is, it goes down very easy. The high alcohol content isn't even the slightest bit noticable.

A nice sized white head sits on a light copper colored beer and slowly fades back. Smell is sweet orange liquer, vitamin c smarties at first, further in I think I can smell some pine hop aromas as well but this may be my from the overload on my palette. Taste is at first sip simply a strong bitterness, dry and grassy in its finish. As the beer warms and I adjust the sweet citrus is evident in the background as well as a piney, peppery, alcoholy kick before a big dry finish.

Smells strongly of pine and lemongrass. Slight grassy smell with a spiciness that I can't identify. Strong hoppy smell.  Tastes as smells. Sweet maltiness initially with a strong spicy hoppy finish.  Full bodied, nice full mouthfeel. Slight oiliness that adds to the drinkability. The alcohol is noticeably present without being too much. The alcohol is well balanced in the taste and mouthfeel with the hops. I would not want to drink anything else after this since it is very strong on the taste buds (in a good way) and I don't think you could really ""taste"" anything else afterwards.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The 7.9% alcohol did not give the beer a very strong alcohol taste or smell, but after drinking one you can def. feel it  A very drinkable beer...wouldnt recommend drinking anything after it because you probably wont even be able to taste any flavor in the next beer",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,beerphan,4.02,"22 oz bomber -&gt; goblet no freshness date  Pours a bright copper mostly clear orange with a very very slight haze which seems to fade, carbonation appears medium with a few bubbles darting north. An impressive 2 inch almost creamsickle colored head. Juicy fluffy lacing.  Nose is a hop blast, piney and fruity hops scents combine for a 'this gotta be a hop monster' scent.  Flavor mimics the nose with a minimal malty blender which gives way to a dry intense long lasting afterburn. At 7.7 i can not pick up even a hint of alcohol.  The mouthfeel is medium and smooth. The overall bitter aftertaste kinda lowers the drinkability in my opinion. A quality brew that does what they say it does.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Higravity,2.61,"This is the 3rd or 4th time I have tried this beer but this is the first time I got the whole thing to myself ;-) thanks Indybeer. I poured it into my Sam Smith Imp pint glass and sat back waiting for the head to settle. It was a nice orange tinted golden beer with a healthy head. The first snif went up my nose, but the after that it was fine. Grassy tannin bitterness (yuck) with a sweet malt and citrus blend. This had way more grass bitter than I remember and it really turned me off. I set it down as I played some ran around killing Zombies in the mall and as it warmed the grassyness mellowed out but never went away. I had a 60 minute after this to wash away the taste and the 60 rocked.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,bwyker,4.22,"We just got Stone back in the area. Refreshed my memory with a pint poured from a bomber:  Pours a clear, golden orange with a thick (3/4) head that reduces to a thin ring with modest lacing pretty quickly. Light carbonation, not a whole lot going on in the glass. Grassy hop smell with a hint of citrus. The aroma and the taste seem to be a little off. Expected (from both the aroma and the description) more hop bitterness, but it was pretty tame. However, there is an earthy-hop (Chinook?) taste up-front and a lasting bitterness in the aftertaste. In between is a little washed out. Mouthfeel is smooth. Not much alcohol (for a DIPA) and plenty of hop character, so its very drinkable. However, in the age of triple IPAs and (soon to be) quadruple IPAs, it might be a little dated -- especially for Stone. I wouldnt be surprised to see a more extreme adaptation in the near future.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Metalmonk,4.53,"That big, fluffy, creamy head really wins me over, as it stays put for a good while. The sunburst orange/golden color is just what the style should look like, and the bubble activity is varied and active.  The aroma treads a fine line between malty sweetness and hop-heaven, achieving a balance between both. Ultimately the fresh pine aroma wins out, but basically the smells wafting off of this brew indicate balanced flavor.  And sure enough, you can't ask for much better in terms of malt/hops balance. Sure, the hops are huge, and fresh, and seductive, and high-quality, and ultra-refreshing...(ahem)...but this isn't a novelty beer. It's a drinkable-as-hell double IPA thanks to the balance from the creamy, caramel-like malts.  The mouthfeel is creamy and zingy, just a smidgen on the thin side but certainly carries this big bad beer through.  Can anyone say a discouraging word about Stone? I sure can't. This is another Stone brew that has the power to (almost) make you forget about all your other favorite breweries. Cheers, tilt glass, liquid nirvana.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Estarrio,4.82,"Stone Ruination IPA has been my favorite IPA since I first tasted it and this bottle further proves to me that Ruination is the defining American Double IPA.  This gem poured a pale, translucent orange with a big, long-lasting, frothy white head.  The aroma is IPA bliss: Citrus, pine, floral bouquets, and lots of hops. Each sniff brings a joyful new palate to the nose, as the aroma is every bit as complex as the flavor.  The flavor is intense, complex and lives up to the name ""Ruination"", as it will surely ruin your palate. It's not as simple as making a poignant, hopped, strong and bitter ale as many craft brews endeavor. Stone finds the perfect balance and complexity of flavors. It is sweet, but not syrupy or cloying. Each taste gives a different nuance of citrus, pine, bitter hops at a near perfect balance. The aftertaste is both bitter and sweet. The bitter finish leaves an extremely subtle dryness that begs for another sip. There exists not even the slightest hint of alcohol taste throughout the depth of hop and fruit flavors.  While each sip brings visions of pine groves and bountiful bouquets of hops, this magnificent brew is surprisingly drinkable. It maintains a relatively light body with a nice amount of carbonation throughout.  This is my favorite IPA. If well chilled, let it warm a bit to unlock the complexities of the of aroma and flavors. Kudos Stone, you have my respect and gratitude!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,peabody,4.32,Poured into my Stella Artois gold-rimmed tulip glass it gave up a rich thick foamy head that left light lacing down from the rim. The color is Cloudy tea colored and slightly orange with lots of tiny bubbles continuing to come up from the bottom.The smell is a wonderful fruity hoppy aroma with bit of alcohol in the mix. The taste is kinda dirty at first but soon yeilds hops and an ainse flavor hidden in the lemony alcohol. Mouthfeel is clean with lots of carbonation to sizzle the tounge. Great flavor and the hops aren't overwhelming. Stone brewery is doing great things.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,flexabull,4.08,"A very bright orange colored beer. Has a tight small but bright white head. Has a slight hop aroma, not quite as much as I tend to like... also has a warm alcohol smell.  This has a really good full mouthfeel. It also shows the alcohol when you taste it. The hops to me are slightly understated, at least compared to what I expected. But it does have a little fruity and pine hop taste, just not overly bitter in my opinion.  A very good, well made beer... I had expected a little more hop bite, but this is more of a refined Double IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,burnstar,4.58,My big bottle of ruination pours a beautiful murky orangish gold with a thick firm head that leaves excellent lacing the whole way down my goblet. The aroma is powerful citrusy piney hops. Theres also some sweetness in the nose. Very enticing. The initial taste is filled with fantastic citrusy hops with some underlying malt evening things out just a bit. Finish is bitter and crips. The mouthfeel is full and creamy. Definitely very delicous and drinkable. Fantastic stuff.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,JMD71,4.2,"Appearance: Pours a cloudy orangey gold. Little head when poured. Low carbonation.  Aroma: Deep, rich, hoppy aroma with notes of citrus & pine. Slightly caramel notes emerge with further deep breaths.  Taste: Rich, malty flavor with wonderful hop depth. Very flavorful. Initial finish seems bitter, but the bitterness fades to a crisp finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodies. Slightly cloying initially but as stated above, it fades to a crisp, clean finish leaving the mouth fairly fresh.  Drinkability: Medium drinkability due to its richness & higher ABV. Very smooth & easy to drink but want to drink it slow to enjoy the fullness of its flavor profile.  Comments: I liked this offering from Stone, I thought it was well balanced with plenty of malt flavor offset by the pungent hops. Not overly bitter & was clean in the end.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,dwarvenspirits,3.85,"Had it poured into a standard pint glass. Nice golden straw color. The beer looked a little hazy. I didn't detect a huge hop aroma. There was a hop aroma but it didn't smack you in the face. Definite citrus aroma and flavor in this beer. A bitter beer, hitting at 100 IBU's it's going to be bitter. But I think that's all this beer is: bitter. There was not a strong hop flavor, it had citrus characteristics and left you with a dry palate when you were done. Mouth feel was good, nice carbonation, body wasn't too heavy, well-balanced for the body. This is a good IPA but it does lack balance. I didn't detect any maltiness or anything to offset the hop bitterness. When you drink this it's like drinking a dry, bitter, citrus drink. If that's what you enjoy then this is perfect.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Georgiabeer,3.52,"I don't rave about this beer the way everyone else does. Yes, this beer is loaded with hops, and I love hops- but- its a pretty one dimensional beer. Give me a Dreadnaught any day of the week over this beer.  Poured a sligtly hazy golden amber. Off white pancake head that quickly fizzled.  Nice citrusy piney smell of- hops. Maybe a little of sweetness on the finish- butter cookies?  The taste is all big hops- spicy, earthy, piney, grapefruit peel.A wintergreen finish. A long lasting bitterness. All in all, pretty raw and unbalanced. I am a hophead, but I like some balance in my beers. Either from a malt backbone or some fruity esters to play with the hops. This is a little harsh. I like the long bitter finish, I just wish it were less one dimensional up front.  Good body for this beer, maybe a little overcarbonated, but fine. Dry finish.  Just okay drinkability for this beer. Yeah, its big and hoppy, but its also unbalanced and a rather simplistic interpretation of a DIPA. I'll have one, and I'll enjoy it, but no real intrigue to draw me back.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Ieatlambfries,4.2,"Poured from a 22oz bomber into my Hop Devil pint glass.  Bright yellow orange. Light tan head about 2 fingers thick. The head didn't stick around too long nor did it leave much lacing.  A lot of hop resin in the nose. Also hints of spices, citrus, and orange blossom.  Upfront flavors of grapefruit rind and pine resin. Spices and blossom honey finishing with warming alcohol when you exhale.  Mouthfeel is a thick. Yet for such over the top flavors quite drinkable. I didn't have a hard time polishing off the bomber in one sitting.  Very impressive Double IPA. I love that it's not super sweet like a lot of the other doubles out there. It really shows off the hops. I've been a pretty happy person since Stone got to New Jersey. If you like hops, check it out.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,TrickKnee,4.22,"MMMM MMMM good, as the bottle states, once you drink this beer, all other beers will taste horrible, and i think they are right.

147,4083,danielocean03,4.42,"Poured a coppery-hued orange color with a one-finger whitish head that slowly fell away to medium sticky lacing. Aroma is richly characterized by citrus and floral hops, sweet caramelly malts are still easily identifiable. Taste is less hoppy that I expected at first, but they begin to go to work on your palate, spreading a wonderful bitter op character all around. Malts back up the practically overwhelming hop profile very nicely, balances out well. Mouthfeel is smooth and slick, lighter end of the medium bodied scale, lower level of carbonation fits this IPA very well. Drinkability high, alcohol not easily detected, smooth and viscous on the tongue. May very well be my newest fix on a hop binge,extremely enjoyable beer. Will purchase again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,NolateM,5,"Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a stemmed pilsner glass. It's orangish-gold and completely free of haziness, and it has a thick, wonderful white head, with very nice lacing quality.  Aroma is powerfully delicious. Citrusy, piney, hoppy... just what I expected, but amped up.  Upon first sip, I think ""wow, this has the incredibly smooth qualities of the regular Stone IPA."" Then I wait a few seconds. Suddenly, I taste a waterfall of hops and citrus and pine and bitterness cascading through my mouth. It gets stronger and stronger as the seconds go by. Yet, the bitterness is pleasant and not overbearing. I had a HopDevil before I drank this, which was actually more bitter than this beer. Still, some might find this Ruination IPA experience difficult to handle... I find it to be one of the greatest IPA experiences of my entire life. No, make that THE greatest.  The mouthfeel is weird, but AWESOME. I give it a five because I can actually feel the hop presence getting stronger and stronger AFTER I sip it. There's not really much malt presence that I detected, but who cares... it's a freakin IPA.  Shockingly drinkable for its alcoholic strength and hop potency. I never thought I'd give a beer straight 5s, but this is a perfect IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BabaJohn,4.35,"Man, I thought it couldnt get much better than Stones stock IPA. Now Im forced to rate something better than the Trois Pistoles. Yikes.   A beautiful, hazy, dark golden / orange color filled my glass, which is something like an oblong snifter. After pouring vigorously a nice, white, sticky head formed just a bit more than one inch tall. It just wouldnt go a way and interesting bubbles and pockets formed, reminding me of the moons surface. Furthermore the brew smelled delicious. Im at a loss for words but I will say that it seemed to indicate the perfection of the IPA genre: sweet but mostly hoppy. Immediately the grainy, bread-like aspect (which is actually fairly minimal) of the beer was tasted but this was followed shortly by the INTENSE hops. After that some sweetness came about followed by some warm alcohol in the aftertaste. Of course the hops lingered throughout. I cant really complain about the feel of this beer, as it is just thick enough and with minimal but still present carbonation and bite. Also, the head has continued to cling to the side of the glass and is slowly dripping or oozing down like fake blood in a B horror flick. Damn this beer is good. Highly recommended.   One final note: as I finish the Ruination, my tongue actually becomes numb from the hops. Wow.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,neenerzig,4.28,"WOW! There is for sure some hoppy bitterness going on with this brew. Pours a clear, medium golden amber color with a frothy looking, initially gigantic head that shrinks in size, retaining itself at about 1/4 inch rather quickly. Nice coating of lacing on the glass as the beer is sipped. I really can't decide which is better, this beer or the regular IPA from Stone. Both are fantastic! Aromas of hops are most dominant with some malt, sweetness, and maybe a hint of certain fruits such as some citrus, perhaps grapefruit, or even a touch of lemon. Taste is pretty much the same as the smell. It is dominated by hops galore! Also present are the aforementioned malts and hints of fruit. Nicely balanced though. The hops certainly make their presence known and come across as somewhat aggressive, but they are not overpowering either. It has a sort of dry and bitter aftertaste, not that this should come as any surprise. This beer has a very nice crisp yet also smooth, frothy and creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation is light to moderate. I am quite pleased how highly drinkable I found this beer to be in spite of its hop bitterness.  Eric",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,idResponse,4.61,"A pretty golden amber that makes all those miller and budweiser beer commercials look like urine. Produced a very wonderful froth and head that tasted and smelled wonderful (i really can't help myself, i've always loved froth since i was a kid drinking root beer). This thing tastes like you're drinking a nice cold hop tea. I don't see a whole lot of post carbonation init but the frothy lace is sticking all over. This tastes better and better with each sip, but as with most IPA's I feel sorry for the next beer. Truly lives up to it's namesake. This beer feels great in the mouth but I doubt the next beer can live up to this, unless it's another Ruination! Definately one of the top IPA's ever.  I've noticed myself coming back to this beer over and over and over. I pay 4-5$ a bottle for the bombers here yet I will splurge every time I am out and pick one of these up. I simply must drink them if possible. Excellent.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Highly recommended, but try it in the bottle first.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,DrJay,4.7,"I didn't even get to try this on tap on my trip to San Diego last year, but I managed to hit The Drafting Room while this was available. What a catch! My pint looked great - clear, golden orange with a short white head of fine bubbles, thick solid lacing throughout. Big hoppiness in the aroma, plenty of grapefruit, a bit powdery. Strong bitterness with lots of orange and grapefruit. Also, a solid malt base that gives the balance necessary for a hop-bomb. Citrus is just in-your-face from the beginning until the last bits of the aftertaste - the hops just linger and linger and linger. There's also just a hint of warmth towards the end as well. Very nice. Silky texture with fine carbonation and a medium/light body. Dryness creeps in as well. This is a hop showcase. It's balanced enough to keep things together, but still an aggressive beer. It seemed just a little more mellow on tap than in bottles, but that's really a minor difference.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,unclederby,4.05,"on tap at mad mex.  12 oz. glass pour with no head at all (i would attribute this to a inept pour from the bartender or a less than beerclean glass, i think), and no lacing at all. color is a light golden with orange tint.  bouquet is surprisingly sweet/malty with little detectable hop noticeable. light notes of grapefruit, orange and apricot present.  taste is sweet and biscuity up front but soon gives way to a hoppy middle and finish, which is slightly tart and marked by notes of grapefruit and pine.  mouthfeel is medium/thin with a touch of graininess and sparse carbonation. nothing coming close to syrupy and full, as expected.  easy enough to put down.  all told, i'm not sure this pour was a fair representation of this beer on tap (maybe it had just been tapped, maybe it was nearing the end). that being said, i would have expected more ""meat"" from this DIPA (as experienced with the bottled version) than i got but it was still a nice beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Obviously this beer has a very strong hop smell, with citrus and pine. It tastes like hops too. A strong hop taste but not overpowering, with a bitter aftertaste at the end which stays around for a while. Not well balanced at all, but this beer is for the hopheads out there. It has a nice medium mouthfeel, slightly slick. Even with all the hoppiness, the beer does go down smooth. I'm not a hophead, but for the style this is a pretty good beer.

Pine and a lemony citrus followed by a nice biscuity malt aroma. The taste is all that I hoped it would be.

Golden orange color with only a little fog (murkiness) for the most part was very clear. Also was medium amount of carbonation. Smell- Hoppy! (which kind of hops I dont know) strong hops with a light scent of alcohol with no smell of malt from what I could smell. Taste- Bitter aftertaste from all the hops. While drinking it was very hoppy which was sweet at first with also some bitterness. Thick lacing all the way till last sip. Maybe a bit fruity? I couldnt taste the alcohol in it.

Some belgian lace displayed on the glass.  This beer has a strong lemony scent. A bit of a grassy scent too. Suprisingly, there's even a little malt detectable in the background. The taste is over-the-top hop bitterness. Bitter aftertaste too. Nice dry finish. The alcohol is well-disguised - the bitterness makes it barely noticeable.  It has a medium-to-full mouthfeel. The higher-alcohol content does not have a strong presence in the mouthfeel. A very drinkable Double-IPA if you're a fan.

Into a pint glass, pours a pretty nice orangish copper with a good finger of head and lacing was fine. Aroma was 'ooh big surprise' enormous hops, but also very nice orange rind, pine, grapefruit, and somewhere a pretty elusive but distinct caramel malt.  Taste is just a wollopping load of hops, unregretful, uncomprimising, just in your face and proud of it. After ArrBastard, this is taking a little longer, and delightfully so, as I pay more attention to waht happens after the sip. Or mouthful swishing around, for that matter. Its funny though, cause it really does just take hold of the palatte and force everything to the side. It commands your full attention, a frontal hop assault that end bitter and wanting, and I need it even more. And its just a little dangerous like that, both in that I can't taste anything else besides this beer, and that I want several more than I know I can't handle.  All in all, too much for more than a couple in one sitting, or even just one, but damned if i'm not going to gave more shipped to me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,GratefulBeerGuy,4.32,"Gotta love the description on the back of the bottle! Good thing it can back that stuff up!  Golden blond/ thick creamy head. good carbonation. looks pretty inviting.  Huge citrus and pine-tree aroma's from loads of hops, slight grains and wheat with a whiff of smooth malt.  This is a very bold IPA with a monster hop attack, but the complexity and balance is still very good, The hop flavors range from bold citric fruits like pineapple and orange peel to semi-bitter, earthiness and very herbal finsih. The malt is subtle but very smooth and effective right at the end for maximum impact. I've seen other folks that are not used to this kind of bold flavor just cringe and crinkle up their face because they just can't understand how someone could enjoy such an attack of flavor...it's funny the things you get used to in life.

147,4083,hgrong,3.82,"22 oz. Bottle ordered from Liquid Solutions.  Pours crystal clear with the color of Budweiser. Nice rocky head that sticks around for a few minutes. Eventually falls to a ring surrounding the brew. The nose is dominated by pine and resin. There is a faint hint of tangerine or grapefruit along with a few pale malts. The hops are overpowering, but eventually give way to grain alcohol. The palate is two dimensional: bitter and alcoholic. On first sip I get astringent bitterness which lasts and lasts and is eventually followed by alcohol. There is a distinct lack malts in the palate to me. I love the way this beer feels in the mouth. It is highly carbonated, rough and aggressive; which is fitting for this brew. The drinkability is hampered in my mind by the alcohol however.  Note: IPA is by far my favorite style, and I have heard many a rave reviews of this beer. That being said, I have to admit that I was slightly disappointed. This is a outstanding beer, but it is not one of my favorite IPA's, even within the ""extreme IPA"" category. For that style I would much prefer a Surly Furious, which I find to be a much more complex beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The beer poured a yellowish-orange color and fairly clear. The head did not last long but did leave some lacing on the snifter I was drinking out of.

147,4083,tr0n2ooo,4.34,"I have to say that I am a little biased, because this is my favorite beer. I just started my ""beer journey"" six months ago, and I have a long way to go. But IPAs are my favorite, and Stone's Ruination is the king.  Appearance: Orange-yellow, fairly clear. Medium head, minimal lacing. No warning of the massive smell and taste of this beer.  Smell: Strong citrus, piney, and some honey. It sends a shiver down my spine.  Taste: Bowls you over with hops, but is mellowed by some maltiness. Not very well balanced, but that's the way I like it.  This is my first review, hope you find it helpful.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Illinick,3.75,"A: Pale golden amber in color with a slightly off white head that retains nicely. Really good lacing throughout. S: Complex. Some tropical fruit-pineapple, lots of floral hops, some citrus rind smells, and some definate piney and woody smells. A sweet malt smell seems to run the gamut. My girlfriend said it smelled almost like perfume and I concor. T: Again with the complexity. Surprisingly the sweet malt flavors seem to dominate. Sweet bread and roasted sweet nut flavors. Woody and piney flavors also. Some tropical cooked fruit flavors-cooked pineapple and also some cooked fruit rind. Hops peek through now and again, but are not bitter and usually make a presence felt in some citrus flavors. The alcohol really makes itself felt throughout and seems to be the driving force here. MF: Chewy at times and finishes with alcohol warmth. Overall: A unique brew with some unexpected flavors. The drinkability may be low for some because of the alcohol presence. But a strong, out of the box DIPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Franchise,4.15,"Pours a beautiful cloudy orange with a off-white head that is frothy and thick. The nose is pine, citrus, oaky, and brisk. The taste is a sharp bitter bite that starts your taste buds on crazy trip. It moves to a suttle and I mean suttle balance of malty honey vanilla sweetness but not much. This is a hop bomb and it will satisfy any hop cravings you desire. I love this DIPA, IMO it should be slightly more balanced but still fantstic.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mcallister,4,"Pumpkin orange with a silky white froth driven head. Very good retention with sticky thick lacing.  Very sweet pine aromas. Some bubble gum in the deep being of this concoction. Slight citrusy background, a lemon edge, with other citrus fruit components. Of course there is a malt and hop aroma that collides in harmony.  I hate to use the same word twice in one review but the malt and thick piney malt live in perfect harmony with each other. Pine is completely dominate in this one. The one thing that hurts it's rating is a somewhat thin mouthfeel. Still a long 30-40 second finish. A lemony refreshing kick round this out. No alcohol present to inhibit any sour edges.  Cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

A: The beer is a bright gold with a thick, foamy, white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.  S: Strong aroma of hops with some citrus and malt and a slight hint of alcohol.  T: Nice intense burst of hops hits you right away and dominates the whole time you drink it. There's a little bit of a citrus malt background to it, but this beer is ALL HOPS.  M: Very crisp, very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation clean finish.  D: It's very tasty and there's no trace of the alcohol, definitely one I had hang with for the whole night.  This is yet another flat out EXCELLENT beer from Stone. I'm always amazed how they can consistently leave their signature in the flavor of a beer, while still representing the style magnificently, no matter what style it may be. Within the style, Dreadnaught is that only one I've had that's better and it's not by much. Since this beer is more accessible and cheaper than Dreadnaught, from now on when I want a DIPA, this is the one I'll choose.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The pour is clear copper with a 1/2"" white head that sinks down into a thin island covering the most of the beer and a thicker ring. The smell and taste is hoppy. Piney hops upfront, followed by grapefruity hops. Crystal malts mainly stay out of the way. The mouthfeel is thinner than I would have preferred. This is a big, bitter beer, but the whole ruining your palate image is a little disingenuous next to Hopsickle and the Plineys.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jdmorgan,4.1,"I had this beer in a 22 oz. glass and it poured a dark gold with a medium head. The nose instantly reminded me of the pure hops which I use often when brewing at home and had all of the piney, fruity, and... er... hoppy aromas that go along with it. The taste was impressive to me in that, although the bitterness was strong and a strong hop flavor was found, this beer was not as overwhelming as I thought it would be. I expected a ridiculously bitter beer (similar to some bad batches of beer), but instead was greeted with a good malt flavor, biting hop flavor, and a high bitterness which actually blended quite well and wasn't too bad. The carbonation was medium and the mouthfeel was good with a hoppy bite to it. The drinkability was good, but in my opinion was not superb do to the fact that I believe the high hop taste would become overwhelming over time without a switch to a milder beer. Overall, I rate this beer as good and certainly worth a try. It has a very high hop characteristic and a high bitterness that makes for a good IPA. However, I believe the beer is worth more for it's novelty factor and thus is not a beer that I would drink consistently.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The smell is a citrusy hop..a mix of lemon and grapefruit.  The taste has a huge hop flavour initially that is quite bitter but as I swish the brew in my mouth, there *is* a definite malt presence there that softens the hop attack a bit but yeah, make no mistake aboot it...this brew is a hop bomb first and foremost and that's a good thing. ;^) That's why I keep picking up this beer when I make my(in) frequent jaunts to Colorado.  Bottom line: A great DIPA that, imho, deserves the reputation that it has acquired. I Highly Recommend it!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,tboom29,4.17,"This poured a nice orange/gold color. A decent head was present, but not an overly thick head, and didn't last real long. The nose was hoppy and citrusy, fairly sweet too. With the first taste, the hops are present. Notes of citrus and spice also lingers, and definitely improve as it warms. This is a very hoppy beer, especially as it warms. The hops definitely linger, as do a slightly oily mouthfeel which is not terribly unpleasant. The maltiness of the beer really mellow the beer, and don't let it become over the top with hoppiness. The mouthfeel is pleasant throughout, but there is a slight alcholol burn that goes along with it. This beer is quite drinkable, but is 7.7% per the label and may even be a bit higher. I can see this paired nicely with some thai or other semi-spicy foods, but not too spicy as I think you definitely want to let your tastebuds stick around for this brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,trep,4.55,"Hazy orange amber body is adorned by a head of EPIC proportions. Creamy and white, looks like marshmallow fluff and leaves a ton of lacing as it slowly fades into nothingness.  Sweet piney hop aroma with a little grapefruit. Its so rich, you could probably cut the scent with a dull spork..that's how thick this is. Gets a 4.5 only because Goose Island IIPA smells better :o  Refreshing coolness at it hits your tongue, then immediately turns to fierce bitterness. The bitter stings your tongue and definitely lives up to its reputation. Destroys your pallet after a few swigs. Won't be able to appreciate the Founder's Red's Rye later on :(. A sweet piney/grapefruit bitterness that lingers on. Smashing rendition of a IIPA.  Excellent body that is medium-full. Not chewy, but a bit oily.  Oh, the drinkability. I always have a hard time rating drinkabilty for a huge beer like this. The bitterness of it basically keeps you from enjoying anything else for the rest of the night and one of these is nearly a vegetarian meal in itself. For what it is, its very drinkable but I couldn't see myself drinking more than one of these in a night.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Taste is so fanatstic you almost never want to drink another IPA. Citrusy,piney hop bitterness. There is a nice mix of the citrusy hops and the slightly sweet malt to make this seem like a very well balanced beer, even though it's just a big, ferocious hop monster.  Mouthfeel is nice medium to light/med. with good carbonation.  The only drawback to the drinkability is that it tastes so good you want to drink more but the abv will get you.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jerrymiller,4.42,"It is actually not far from the truth that if you drink Ruination IPA, you are ""ruined"" for other beer. (Too bad it just comes off as more elitist Stone marketing piffle.)  Appearance: Bright, clear orange with a thick, long-lasting head. The lace lasts a very long time.  Smell: It has to be all the hops that make is smell so floral. There are also notes of citrus and alcohol - pretty complex.  Taste: It isnt a secret that this is a very hoppy, bitter beer. If you love hops, this beer is exceptional not because it has the most (it has a lot) but because it does the most with them. Hard to quantify in words, but this is a pretty massive drink.  Mouthfeel: A medium bodied, evenly carbonated IPA.  Drinkability: Delicious and hoppy. A nice session brew if it werent for the ABV.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I detect some piney scents. Also, grassy hops are present. I slight citrus aroma is also present.  This beer tastes great. I taste pine up front. Behind that, I get a strong grassy hop flavor. The alcohol is only slightly detectable in the flavor. This beer is very well balanced. A cirtus grapefruit flavor is also detectable.  This full bodied beer is surprisingly smooth. It leaves a piney aftertaste. It is carbonated well.  This beer might not be the best session beer because it is a little high in alcohol. Also, the flavor might become a little overbearing after some time. Ultimately, this is a great beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,instrumentality,3.55,"Let me start off by saying that Stone Brewing Company has quickly become one of my favorite breweries. Up until now, they have yet to fail to impress me with any of their offerings.  The Ruination IPA is an exception, and a highly disappointing one at that, given that I love IPA's and especially the regular Stone IPA.  The beverage poured a transparent, light, golden-carmelly sort of color, with carbonation bubbling continuously to the surface. It carried a thick, foamy, off-white head that settled to about 1/2"" with lace clinging to the sides of the glass.  The odor was, as expected, a strong smell of piney hops.  My first impression upon tasting this beverage was positive. It had a similar piney, hoppy flavor to the standard Stone IPA, but there was something extra in there, a slight creaminess with a hint of caramel that I never would have expected from this style.  But then, back came the hops, burrowing their way into my tongue and the roof of my mouth, where they refused to settle down. As much as I love a good hoppy beer, I'm not big on the bitter, skunky residue left behind by this one. I find Stone IPA to be a much cleaner, crisper beer that's actually refreshing despite the bitterness, and one where you actually have to take another sip to replenish the bitterness. This one just pummels the palate mercilessly.  As I continued to drink, I also found that I wasn't quite so appreciative of that creaminess and caramel flavor, as it seemed to clash with the caked-in bitterness that had taken control of the inside of my mouth.  Overall, this wasn't a bad beer--I was able to finish the bottle, and I've recently begun to allow myself to dump beers down the sink when they really aren't doing it for me. It was just a bit too much of an assault on my taste buds. Maybe this is what I should expect from a double IPA--I believe this is my first. Again, Stone IPA is my favorite IPA and probably in my top 5 beers periods, but perhaps this is my limit in the hops department. I think I've also found that I don't want anyone messing with my hops by throwing in creamy caramel-ness (as with the Ruination) or pear-ness (as with the Avery Maharaja).  I'll give it another try and update my review if I find that it grows on me; I owe Stone that much.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ultralarry2006,4.47,"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle. Left a one finger head with some retention and some lacing here and there. Color was a yellowy-almost-orange amber.  Smell - Piney, piney, piney. Some bread, caramel.  Taste - bitter pine, bitter pine again, resin, and some bready, caramelly malt quietly balancing pine. Piney, resiny, finish and aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - full, smooth, low carbonation, a little chewy, some hop oil slickness, pleasantly bitter with some pleasant drying.  Drinkability - goes down easy, tastes good and with low abv for a DIPA, I could go for another 22 oz. bomber in any given session.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,petemorris,4.5,"While I cut my craft-beer teeth two decades ago on Sierra Nevada's hoppy pale ale, I can't really call myself a hophead by today's rather ambitious standards. Thus, with a bias toward ""balanced"" beers rather than more extreme offerings, and with a lukewarm response to Stone's Arrogant Bastard (which I find way too harshly bitter), I wasn't very optimistic about Stone's facefull-of-hops iconic DIPA. But man is this one outstanding beer! The hop aroma upon opening and pouring is indeed in your face. It's an aroma I enjoy while brewing beer, but much like black pepper and vanilla when cooking, I'd rather it be tempered and blended with other ingredients when actually drinking beer. In other words, not unpleasant, just out of place. But that's the last of my complaints. The bitterness is definitely pronounced, but the beer remains surprisingly drinkable. There are some really good sweet, biscuity malt undertones to this beer, as well as an appropriate amount of alcoholic warmth. Moreover, the longer one lingers over this beer, the more those malt aromas and flavors come through, making for an amazingly balanced beer (for something that claims &gt;100 IBUs) and a relatively drinkable one, too, at least for a beer of its strength. I'm still not much of a fan of Stone's imagery (gargoyles, dare-you-to-drink-me marketing type/hype), but a great beer will always rise above its packaging.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Light tan head that dissipates quickly to a thick float with mostly tiny bubbles with small ones clustering, ok lace. Low carbonation. Very interesting and tempting scent. Citrus, grass and orange flower. Hops are clearly in the forefront and lend a mild spiced and citric character to the smell. Strong powerful hops up front which seem to quickly progress into the lingering aftertaste of mellow yet spiked hop oils. Faint vanilla, almond skin and marzipan. Full body and slick. Good coating. Interesting brew. Fully hopped and delicious.  -Oelergud",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Smell- I expected nothing but hop bitterness but there was a huge amout of malt sweetness. Lots of citrus, floral, woody hops with the malt sweetness to back it up.  Taste- Huge, huge, huge. Malt sweetness begins, the hops battle through nicely. Citrus, perfumey floral, slightly grassy hops, and surprisingly, tons of malt to balance it all out.  Mouthfeel- Crisp, clean, and devastating on the tongue. This one assaults you from the start and doesn't let up for a minute. Rolls down and leaves you wanting more.  Drinkability- Love it. Don't plan on drinking anything else after this one, but you won't want to. I could drink a few of these with no problem. Not nearly as bitter as the &gt;100 IBU would imply due to the massive malts. One of the best.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Some caramel underpinings alos present. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied yet absolutely palate coating in its intensity. Combines grapefruit with hop oil and spicy resins. Hop lovers experiment for sure. Drinkability is very high, although unless you have some spciy fodd to accompany it, you can write our taste buds off for the rest of the evening/day whatever.

147,4083,normZurawski,3.38,"After all this time, Stone finally comes to New Jersey. All the hype, all the waiting, for...this? There is one word to describe this beer - bitter, bitter, bitter. The front of this is tasty, an almost smooth combination of flavors that instantly hit your tongue. But the follow though is such a broadside of bitterness that anything good gets wiped out almost instantly. There seems to be a trick in drinking this. Wash it out on the side of your tongue quickly then swallow. That way, not so much of the bitterness lingers in the mouth. But then, you're pounding the beer, not allowing the taste to linger in your mouth. For me, that's not the desired intent. That's generally how you drink straight vodka.  I don't know what it is about these Stone beers. But when I finally get my hands on some of their top offerings, they never fail to disappoint. Maybe expectations are a bit high. But really, no matter I expect such a strong bitterness is going to hinder anything I drink. Maybe I'm an East Coast hack, unable to appreciate the West Coast brilliance.

Pours cloudy orange/amber with a fluffy off-white head with good retention. Quick, thin lacing. Robust hops and citrus aroma. Rich, smooth body with an achingly good hops flavor, full of citrus and floral notes. Some malt and caramel flavor in the background as well. The cask-conditioning does wonders for this beer's drinkability, and it is frighteningly easy to drink to begin with. The finish is smooth with a lingering hops taste that begs you to keep drinking.

147,4083,beerphilosopher,4.57,"Ahhh yes, my first experience with the infamous ""Ruination."" Ominous-looking bomber bottle, 22oz'er. I dig the rough textured label. Intentional? Anyway, pours a crystal clear tangerine orange color, with a white, rocky head. Thin lacing, and good retention. Nose ... I could smell this one immediately when the bottle was rendered capless! Citrus, pine, and sweet malt-like overload! I could tell this one was gonna be something special. Palate didn't disappoint ... hardcore hop bitterness, overwhelmingly citrus fruit-laden complexity. Curiously, there is a decided sweet malt subtlety underneath all the hop heaviness as well. This one hits you hard, knocks you down, then picks you back up again. Incredibly complex ...not just a ""let's see how much hop punch we can get in here"" kind of brew. Finished very clean, with a lot of residual fruity notes, along with a pleasant hop aftertaste. I'd say this is medium-bodied, and only lightly carbonated. This is really a masterful double IPA in my estimation ... I'm fascinated with the sheer hop power this beer has, while managing to maintain a subtle malt character at the same time. The combination is very ""juice-like"" to me ... moreso as it warms a bit. An incredible brew. If you're into hops, get it NOW. If you're not, it may just be complex enough for you to appreciate none the less ... my wife, for example, doesn't care for hoppy beers typically ... she liked this one, believe it or not. Superb!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Aroma was a kick in the face of piney hops, mild fruits, not much malt. Hops and more hops, mild alcohol. A bitter, piney hoppiness immediately gets you here, then blends into a sour sweetness, maybe citrus and other fruits? Once agian not much maltiness. Alcohol is noticable. Very good feel; bitter and sour, yes, but balanced well with mild sweet fruits and carbonation. I had a bomber of this guy and what it says on the back was true; you're taste buds are destroyed after a few glasses let alone the whole thing. Plus the 7.7% AABV doesn't help matters. It's a phenomenal beer to drink, but in moderation. Hats off once again to one of my favorite breweries.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The smell a strong hoppy aroma with a slight floral background. Taste was all hops, but balanced nicely with the malt. Very smoothe for such a hoppy beer.

A thick foamy head forms that is moderately resilient. The head dissipates to islands of foam on the surface of the beer. Moderate lacing also forms on the sides of the glass.  The smell is quite strong and hoppy, as expected. There are fruity esters along with traces of evergreen, pine, and a hint of a spice like garlic.  The taste is also extremely hoppy as expected. There is also a sour and bitter citrus flavor, grapefruit and a hint of sweet malty, grain, flavor underlying the tremendous hop presence. There is a mildly bitter and warm aftertaste that is fairly shortl-ived. The flavors are reasonably well balanced for the style.  Mouth feel is crisp, refreshing and clean. The beer is fairly heavily carbonated.  This is a very drinkable beer, especially for the summer season, but it would be good year round. A very pungent and flavorful beer. I think Stone Ruination it is a good representative of the style, and would certainly have it again. Very nice!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Two-fingers of white, somewhat fluffy, head formed and carbonation streamed up the sides of the glass.  The nose is heavily hops with a piney floral background aroma. Some flowery esters and a soft fruit scent. Behind all that, a subtle malt presence.  The innitial taste greats the palate with hop bitterness and alcohol. ABV is readily apparent even at cooler temperatures. Soft citrus flavors are present but not over-power. This is not a grapefruit bomb. A sharp and crisp finish with a piney bite that suprisingly reveals an almost sweet maltiness. Just hints of malt float throughout the beer.  Medium body with a crisp finish and high carbonation.  This beer is indeed drinkable and enjoyable. ABV is potent throughout and one bomber of this makes you feel the ruinous affect it can have. Well balanced throughout given that despite how hoppy it is, tiny pockets of sweetness and malt protrude. Truly and enjoyable beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Looks impressive...it has to have a ton of hops infused to have that lovely cloudy color.  Flavor: What an awesome balance of hop resins, bitterness, orange peel, lemon zest, grapefruit rind, a touch fruity and a little sweetness to help temper this hop maelstrom. Just heavenly.

It reminds me of a hop cacaphony. Pine, grapefruit, orange, and friends all screaming ""notice me!"" A nice crisp looking half inch head adorns a scarlet/orange body. The taste is dominated by pine and caramel that duke it out in the main event and grapefruit, bitterness, and orange fight it out to see who'll place third. I like the balance.

Smell: I was knocked off my feet so quickly I am having a hard time writing the review. I must say this aroma left me salivating from the get-go. Strong aromas of toasted malts dark sugars and of course bold citrus (slightly pine) hops. This is an extremely aromatic beer. mmm.  Taste: Rich and perfectly balance bold bitter DIPA that has a bit of sweetness as well. It is just so easy to accept I would have expected something much more harsh from all that I have heard about this beer. It has a sweet toasted malty character as well and the bold woody floral (not quite piney) citrus hop character. There is a mild earthy attribute. The aftertaste leaves me tingling but salivating for more. It is big! But, it is still easy to take it! The only thing I can say is - exceptional!  Mouthfeel: This is a medium body beer with a *very* strong backbone. With 7.70 % ABV the alcohol is so well masked is remarkably smooth despite the tingle it leaves on the tongue.  Drinkability: DANGEROUS! This beer is so tasty and drinks so easily I don't even know what to compare it to. It is truly in a league of it's own. That said, one bomber is certainly plenty.

Sits in the glass a god-looking honey-orange, just a bit hazy, with an active off white head that settles down at a somewhat quick rate.  Aroma is good, but there's nothing outstanding here. Oranges, peaches, lots of pineapple- but still a little nutty, with a nice icing of floral hops.  Spicy right up front, woodier than expected, with a thick alcohol kick. Round and fruity at the end, but with a high hop bitterness that stays strong until the end.  Liquid is hearty, but not thick- with a strong tight carbonation. The carbonation is a but much for me, but not so much it gets unpleasant.  I'll have to let it warm up on me.

Pours a clear orange-copper. Decent off-white head, if a little short-lived. Strong, strong aromas of bigs hops, alcohol-soaked raisins and dark fruit. A touch of licorice. No surprise here, but the hops are huge on the palate as well. First the flavor, then a robust bitterness, then more flavor hops plus the flavor and sensation of alcohol. Lest Ruination be accused of one-dimentionality, there's even some firm malt in the finish, and this increases in prominence with each sip, coupling deftly with the alcohol. Bitterness lingers into the finish, but almost unobtrusively so. There's no cloying at all. I daresay the promised ""ruinous effect"" upon my palate has gone unfulfilled, but only because I dig on the hops so much!  In some respects, it may be unfair to categorize this beer as a Double IPA, pitting it against such behemoths as Dogfish 90. Indeed, at 7.7% ABV it's near the lower end of the style guidelines. Ruination is really what I'd like to be drinking every time I drink a regular IPA: alcohol on the high end, hops gone amuck, eminent drinkability.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,cooncat,4.7,"Serving was from a 22 oz. bottle.  WOW!  On the pour, you get a beautiful golden colored ale, with a nice, thick head. The head dimishes soon, but there remains a fine ring all the way to the bottom. Lacing is quite evident all the way down to the last drop. The nose is wonderful and fantastic, full of hop aromas to sate the most voracious hop head. The first sip will knock your socks off with a hop bitterness that astounds. Mouthfeel is, to my taste, ""just right"" for an IPA; not too heavy, but definitely not thin. Initially, its almost 'chewy', but then you get rather used to it by the end, and it seems just very smooth. The alcohol content is significant, so this is an ale to respect .. a couple of glasses will make a fine session.  I thought I'd had some of the best IPAs from Victory Brewing: Hop Devil and Hop Wallop. However, truth be told, I would have to rate this IPA slightly higher than either of those. If you are into IPAs and/or are a 'hop head', this is a MUST beer for you.  Cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,IntriqKen,4.4,"Damn...this is nasty stuff. Pours a golden amber with a nice thick 2 finger head that melts ever so slowly to a very thick lacing. Beautiful! Aroma is immediately...HOPS...lots of hops, citrusy hops and little else. Taste surprises you with sweet malts, orange and lemon and grapefuit hops, toasted malts. The hops try to overpower, but it can't be done. Malts mellow everything out to an incredibly balanced taste. Mouthfeel is initially smooth and buttery that changes quickly to a drying citrus from the hops and slight alcohol warming as it goes down. This is one very nice beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Phyl21ca,4.15,Bottle (Courtesy of Hogtownharry): Poured a bright copper color beer with a nice foamy bright white head with great lacing and retention. Beautiful floral aroma with solid sweet malt as a backbone. Taste is also dominated by the floral texture of the hops with a great nice bitter finish. Great balance between bitter and floral malt and great presence of malt. Body is above average and alcohol is well hidden. I was really impress since I am not the greatest fan of IIPA.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Hautacam,4.05,"22oz bottle with a nasty looking gargoyle. ""A liquid poem to the glory of the Hop "". Light orange with a foamy head that drops very quickly to a film. Strong hop-perfume..intense...like snorting hop pellets. Fresh pineapple...very floral. There is a sweet malt background to this, but it really is all about the hops...spruce, pine, grapefruit rind...very flavorful and bitter. Really good. Alcohol comes through as it warms up. I'll be tasting hops in my sleep ! Wow. Medium body..medium carbonation...slightly syrupy. A very good hop -bomb ! This is no haiku...it's an epic.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,AltBock,3.73,"22oz. bomber bottle with a cool silk screened picture of the Stone gargoyle kneeing down a giving a dead stare at anybody who walks by it or buys this beer. The back label was also silk screened and gave the definition of the word Ruination and tons and tons of information about the beer. No date on either the front or back, but does list that this beer is at over 100+ IBU.  Appearance: When poured into a Snifter, the beer was a golden/orange color with close to a 1 finger head of white foam. The head dissipated fast leaving very little lace and very little rings around the glass.  Smell: There wasn't much in the aroma department. What I got was plenty of strong piny hops with some citrus fruits, like the grapefruit in the background. I tried to get more of the aroma out, but the piny hops remained king in the aroma.  Taste: Just what I expected form this beer with an IBU 100+. A strong piny hoppy taste and then finishes with a spicy dry taste of citrus fruits. If there was any malt or anything else in the taste, the strong hops taste took it over. Basically this taste was a hop bomb!  Mouthfeel: It was very slick. I couldn't taste the alcohol or even feel it for that matter, but the aftertaste was dry and very bitter.  Drinkability: Not something you would want to drink on a regular basis, unless you love hop bombs! A nice offering from Stone Brewing Co.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,briman,4.32,"Served from bottle into standard pint glass.  Pours a hazy amber, lots of gold tones. Slightly more than a half-inch fluffy white head retains well, leaving a nice amount of lacing.  Aroma is hoppy, pine, citrus (oranges, tangerines).  Taste is strong hops. Touch of malt sweetness right in the beginning, but not much, as the hops really dominate this one. Hoppy citrus notes tend toward bitter grapefruit rind starting in the middle and following through until the end. Finishes dry, with a nice lingering hop bitterness, and a bit of an alcohol bite.  Medium body & carbonation. Seems pretty well balanced, though the malt is definately behind the scenes. Compared to some other double IPA's I've tried, this one is more in line with what I expect from this style. High ABV, so can't imagine much more than one at a time, but I certainly plan on having more of these in the future.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,AaronHomoya,4.72,"22 oz bomber bottled poured into a tall hefeweizen-style glass.  The first thing I noticed was the incredible aroma! Powerful hoppy, citrus aroma made even more amazing to me by the fact that this was my first IPA.  Color was a nice golden amber and the head was nice with good retention.  This beer has a pretty bitter flavor with lots of hops and a nice clean finish that is not harsh but leaves you wanting more. No real notice of the alcohol. Mouthfeel was medium to light and nice and smooth.  This is still my favorite IPA and I could drink it all day. Highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,InsolublePancake,4.75,"Saw this for the first time at a Newport News Total Wine and had to give it a try.  A- Nice golden color with a good head and lots of lacing. Was also a little cloudy; hop particles?  S- Floral and citrusy hops. There was also a little bit of sourness, kind of like orange juice. Hints of yeast were also detectable.  T- Wow, this is nice. Starts off with a little malt sweetness that is quickly overtaken by the hops. Hops have a very interesting character, kind of spicy and herbal with a taste almost like a peppercorn. Finishes quite bitter, although not as bitter as I was expecting.  M- Medium bodied and slick, not a ton of carbonation as the appearance might suggest. Goes down very smoothly.  D- Off the charts. I could drink these until I passed out.  This was an incredible beer. I was fully prepared to dislike it because of its reputation of being incredibly bitter, but instead I was blown away. Quite different from other DIPA's I have tried (such as the 90 Minute I had earlier) in that it is not very sweet and citrusy, but it is delicious. Highly, highly recommended.  EDIT: In the time since this review, I've had a couple of samples of this beer that did not live up to my original review. They weren't terrible, but they weren't nearly as good as I remembered this beer being. I'm almost certain that I can attribute this quality to freshness. I'm not going to edit my scores because when this beer is fresh, it is incredible and worthy of the score I gave it. However, it must be drunk FRESH. Since the bottle doesn't have a freshness date (that I can see), it may be difficult to tell how fresh it is. You should probably inquire about how long it has been in the store before buying it. Otherwise, you may be disappointed.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,evanackerman,3.61,"this beer pours a deep orange haze with a billowing head.  aroma is dominated by hops with an alcohol character as well.  taste is very hoppy and there is a deep nutty malt flavor to balance.  mouthfeel is a bit thinner than other 2IPAs that i like better but it is still very good.  drinkability is not bad for a beer this big.  overall, a very good beer but it did not quite live up to the hype for me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,bignick,3.38,"22 oz bottle purchased at Bauer Wine and Spirits in Boston. Poured into an Ommegang glass.  Pours an orangey pale color with an invitingly frothy head. This beer also has an inviting, fruity scent, with easily enough hop oil to foreshadow the hop attack that is about come. The taste is all hops, but it is without the usual sweetness that accompanies big American DIPAs. I find Ruination to be too dry to really enjoy; it is just too rough.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Drew966,4.2,"Stone Ruination IPA poured a cloudy orange from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. Very hoppy, citrusy aroma. Taste is very hoppy, as expected. Quite good, citrusy flavors, not quite a grapefruit flavor, but almost. Definitely an intense beer, not for those who don't like hops. Recommended, worth seeking out.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,artusory,4.57,"Pours amber with a big white head, that fades to nice cover.Nice lacing. The aroma is lots of pine and grapefruit, some caramel notes. Flavor is grapefruit and caramel malt, with a good bit of resinous pine. Texture is very smooth, easy drinking. Terrific!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,bgraney,4.25,"Honey colored with a short head that quickly disolved. Definitely looks like something you want to drink. I was expecting the aroma to be dominated by the hops but was surprised as it seemed that particular scent was subdued. Nice fruity/cinnamon background. Again, the taste was less hoppy than I was expecting but the balance was outstanding. Very smooth and delicious. Lingered nicely as the taste permeated the entire mouth/nose area. Went down very easy as all of the flavors blended well. After the initial pour/look/sniff/taste I was going to turn on Sunday Night Baseball but decided to just sit with the beer and enjoy it in silence.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Shovelbum,4.4,"Pours a thick creamy white head over a slightly hazy deep golden copper-tinted body. Chunky bands of lace and a head that won't quit. Aromas of floral and citrus hops greet the nose before Ive even lifted my glass. Traces of sweet malt are detectable in the nose as well, but barely in all those hops. As suspected the hops dominate the flavor as well. Floral and citric hops pack a wallop of bitterness and flavor. The malt still represents, providing a note of sweet smooth sanity in this show of hops. Moderate to full mouthfeel with low carbonation. A lingering citric bitterness.  Definitely a tour de force of hops. The substantial malt also helps balance things out making this quite a drinkable DIPA. Having said that, I find that cellaring this brew makes it much more suitable to my tastes. I find it really brings much more balance, while still leaving a bounty of hop flavor. It also leads to a less acidic, and how shall I say, less 'ruinous version of the brews. I know, Im a wuss. To those of you who down this stuff fresh by case when its fresh: I salute you. I'll stick to my cellared versions.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,cubedbee,4.47,"22 oz bomber poured into an imperial pint glass, nice golden amber color with a finger of off-white head, decent retention, some scattered lacing on the glass. Nose is all hops, strong, resinous, piney and floral hops, very nice, makes you want to dive right in. Taste is exactly what you expect, huge juicy hops, grapefruit and citrus upfront, lingering pine and bitterness on the finish. Despite the massive amount of hops, a nice caramel malt tries to balance as well as it can. Medium/full bodied, moderate carbonation, and a very crisp finish. This is a very good DIPA, perfect for any hophead, ashame it doesn't come in 12 oz bottles.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,TurdFurgison,4.47,"Saved this for after the first lawn mow of the year. I guess I'll celebrate anything..  Poured from 22oz bottle into a pint glass. I wish this beer came in 12oz bottles like the Stone IPA does, but I haven't seen them. The appearance was very pilsner-like, clear golden yellow with white frothy head. I've seen more dark orange and reddish colors from other double IPA's, so this was surprisingly light.  Smells hoppy, but not one-dimensionally. There's some sweetness in the smell too. The taste is also more complex than I expected, not just hoppy and bitter. I could taste the malt in the background. The after-taste is pretty bitter, but not too bad.  Not something to get everyday due to the cost, but nice once in a while. Might be interesting to compare side-by-side with Stone IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,joeskirkie,4.15,"This big beautiful bastard had to go in my snifter.  A perfect orange amber, nice off white head. Smells like pine needles and lime, so strong and nice.  Take a moment to read the bottle if you haven't yet. Then taste...hops, glorious hops. But first a smooth maltiness. It's chased away by a ransacking wave of bitterness. Take your time though. Once you get over the initial shock of hops the flavours balance and grow stronger.  It's so crisp and just a lovely drinking experience.

Good smell, but could have been more floral or fruity  Taste: a light malty start...bready and crisp. an excellent hop finish that is really hoppy without being overly bitter. I was expecting more a ""full"" flavor with this....its still good though  Mouthfeel: crisp, refreshing.  Drinkability: for an american double IPA....freaking drinkable as hell. this one could creep up on you if you drank a few.  overall, a great beer",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Smell: Hops Hops and maybe a bit of caramel if you really concentrate.  Taste: Ok so this beer is a hob bomb 100+ IBUs. Despite this the maltliness and higher alcolhol make it quite palatable.

147,4083,CAMRAhardliner,4.92,"I have been waiting to try this beer for years, and finally its in my hands. mmm hops. I think its a fitting beer for my 400th review.  It pours a glowing orange with a modest ivory the leaves fat lace trails behind. The aroma consists of a wallop of resiny hop oils, some grass and and some emasculated malt breadyness. The hops rule in the taste as well, pungent American hops with scads of grapefruit essence smack my mouth from the get go. Piney coniferous flavors also abound. The malt profile is very understated at first but develop as the beer warms. A pleasant cookie dough character hides amongst the hop garden. The mouthfeel is medium and lightly carbonated, with mouthcoating hop oils. The finish is very bitter and overpowering... bliss.  This is the hoppiest beer Ive yet had and I love it. At times I thought my enamel was being replaced with lupulin. A work of art.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

A solid effort.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

A resinous piney smell hits first with bits of orange peel and a hint of biscuity malts, very nice. The taste actually made my mouth pucker, very bitter, it has a piney earthy bitterness with not much malt in the background. The active carbonation contributed to the bitter bite. I drank this a little bit above cellar temp; I think that accounted for the bite. I've had this before a little cooler and I remember more malt.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Mark,4.2,"This beer is quite different from it's bottled version. Amber gold color is topped by a foamy white head, lacing was prevalent from mid glass on down.

It pours a slightly hazy copper orange color with a nice head that disappears too quickly for my liking. The aroma is fantastic. Hops, hops and more hops with a slight alcoholic smell mixed in. It has a perfumy smell. Me likey. The taste has a bitterness to it but also has a nice malty underpining. The hops definitely win out though as they should.

147,4083,Ego,4.27,"now that stone is readily available in jersey I thought I would review this old favorite...  eyes... jeez, I can smell it from here.. I'll get to that though... golden with a reddish tinge, very sticky head that stays calm (about 1/4 finger high), clean and clear looking with distinct columns of bubbles rumbling up from the bottom of the chalice. nice looking but not overwhelming.  nose... amarillo anyone ? pinecone citrus bomb, pure and simple. This may be the closest to a real pine smell I have ever passed unde this nose. This screams evergreen. Not much else but man is that a nice scent for hop freaks. I can't score this too high because it so one dimensional but damn that one dimension is outstanding.  taste etc... medium mouthfeel enhanced by perfect carbonation.. I mean really, wtf? the carbonation is sickly good, it is just short of ""prickly"" but carries the brew to perfection. This has some excellent toe curling bitterness to it. but yet the bitterness doensn't linger as long as some IPAs.... making you want that next sip.... which of course is the damn danger in this. You don't sense the strength of this one until it sits in your gut for a few minutes and rots out your pancreas... for as bitter as this is.. and strong as this is.. damn this is drinkable... save for a slight ash aftertaste under the bitter this may be damn near perfect  verdict? not the best looking not the best smelling but this bitch goes down on you... and you love it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The head sticks around as the bubbles swirl and stream up from the bottom of the glass. Nice sticky lacing leaves a story of every sip.  The first sniff is of powerful piney, fresh sappy resinous hops that just about peel your socks off, seriously. Once you get past the hop blast, notes of lemon peel and orange peel come into play, sweet yet tart.  First quaff, an enormous hop-bomb explodes in your mouth and then gently fades into a citrus aftermath, with some sweetness turning bitter in the end. Insanely tasty stuff to any hop-head on earth, IMO this is the best tasting Ruination that Stone has ever brewed and I've tasted plenty of them. The alcohol is invisable but don't let that fool you...it's strong stuff.  In the mouth, this stuff grows...plenty of body with a bubbley smooth feel as it quenches your hop thirst.

I'm hoping that I didn't wait too long  Poured too aggressively from a bomber into the Stone Ruination mug from the company. A very big, frothy head that is taking its sweet time to come down. A hazy golden-amber body  A definite hop aroma, but doesn't pack too much of a punch. Could this be a result of it being around too long? I was expecting a bit more.  The same goes for the taste. The body seems to be a bit watered down, but still has a lot of flavor. Hops dominate leaving a lingering grapefruit bitterness on the tongue.  I could definitely drink this on a regular basis if it was available in my hometown. Even with the bottle being around for awhile in my possession (and who knows how long before that), it is an outstanding beer.

I don't know about that, but it is a tart like pungent hoppy nose. t: Lemony fresh with a strong bitter punch to keep you honest. m: medium bodied but a creaminess to it. d: very intense and high alcohol makes this a sipper to be sure.  This is a enjoyable beer. 750 ml bottle was getting a bit warm so I put it in the freezer for a bit. Naturely I fogot about it as I sipped away at the glass I poured. Needless to say my next glass was ice cold. Usually I don't like ice cold beer, but this is pretty good.

147,4083,beermanbrian,4.44,"Golden/orange color with thin white head. Wisp of lacing remain on the glass as you consume this one. Smell is huge citrus hops. It smacks you in the face and just overwhelms the senses. Taste is bitter, but more of a piney, resinous bitterness than the smell. The bitterness is so extreame that it gives the beer almost a burnt taste. Very full and chewy mouthfeel. I believe this is the first DIPA that has lived up to my expectations for hoppiness. Others have seemed to be too sweet but that is not a problem with this one. Don't get me wrong, there is a malt backbone to this that eventually works it's way into your perception but the highlight of this baby is the hops. A beer for the true hop head only.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,copasetic,4.22,"Pours a deep gold with a minimal head and thin lacing after just a bit. The smell: Boom! Hops. Sweet and pungent all at the same time. Every sip of this is milder than I think it ought to be. At 100+ IBUs (as per the label), this is clearly a hoppy beer, but the bitterness does not overwhelm. Rather, the most prominent flavors are the sweet citrusy hop notes. Medium bodied, but with a tangy aftertaste, this one is great, but strong. The 22oz bottle is definitely enough for a sitting.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,maddamish,4.65,Hop bomb in my mouth. My fiance walked in the house and even though I was sitting across the room she could smell this bad boy. There is a strong orange/hop armoa (Yes aroma) that proceeds from this brew crafted by devils. (Ok I am done with the drama).  Gold in color and not only did it retain it's head but when it did lace it was present throughout.  A great beer for those hop heads out there.

147,4083,Graebner,4.62,"Pours a very pretty cognac/apple juice orange-brown. develops a fair amount of head even if you pour to avoid it. Looks very good, but not terribly extreme.  Smells of hops, obviously, but expecially of rosewater, lots of pine needles, smoke, citrus rind and occasionally some alcohol. Smells much different than most IPA's, let's you know that you're not in for the regular ride.  Taste also of rosewater, the sour of pine needles and the bitterness of pine pitch, citrus rind. Also some gum sweetness. Reminiscent of sucking on a pine sap, rose hip, grapefruit juice and grapefruit rind shake. Mmmm. Also feels like eating pine pitch...coats the inside of your mouth and leaves the bitterness in the back of your throat. A *slight* maltiness as you swallow.  Mouthfeel is pretty much perfect. Starts out light and gets a little heavier over the back of the tongue. Not too heavy. The carbonation is perfectly balanced. Be warned, it pretty much destroys your sense of taste for quite some time. Not cloying, just absolutely sends your tastebuds into shock.  You could probably drink this all night long, but you wouldn't be able to taste anything past the first one. I don't recommend it, though, since the ABV will get you sideways really fast. Apart from that, though, drinkability is A+.  Finally, it's obvious that the folks at Stone put a lot of effort and careful work into this beer. It really comes through, and it's kind of touching. You can taste it in the beer...this one was *created*, not just brewed.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Freshie,4.69,"Poured a rather normal golden honey hue, that was very clear. A nice frothy off-color white head that contained a few large bubbles.  The aroma was o so hoppy, with citrus higlights, and a very crisp nature to it. Tantalized my nostrils.  As the label suggests, my first tatse hit my mouth like a ton of hop bricks. After the intial hop whallop, the taste gave way to some nice roasted malts, then citrus/woody/floral/grassy type tastes fluttered around my tongue.  The mouthfeel is great, it is a very diverse brew, with many different levels. The alcohol is very present, yet smooth and satisfying, not burning at all. It is a pleasure to have the taste linger long after you swallow.  I am a fan of Stone, and I can't believe it took me this long to get around to this brew. But it was worth the wait. Even though it is non sequitor, the labels on the bottles are always a humorous read. It says alot about a brewery who puts in alot of work in every brew, from the actual brewing process right down to the label.  Cheers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,macster,4.12,"22 oz. bomber at 55 degrees. Pours a slightly hazy sunset orange with a frothy and lasting white head. Just a huge hop nose emminates from the snifter. Orange, grapefruit, crushed pine needles, its all right up front, but not much in the way of any malt aromas to be found. A nice round mouthfeel with the subdued carbonation level keeping it silky smooth. Massive hop flavor profile; like biting into a whole grapefruit encrusted in honey and pine needles. Some faint crystal malt sweetness attempts to balance out the big muscle hops. Finishes with a big, bold and crisp bitterness; nice and long. The 7.7% interplays nicely being present just enough to accentuate all the luscious flavors of this classic American IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,tattooedtolley,4.82,"22oz bomber  Appearance: Dark golden in color with an off white head that is shortly lived leaving tons of lacing.  Smell: Tons of citrus and piney hops. Definitely smells of Stone's IPA. Got to love this smell.  Taste: Tons of big hop taste. I would like to say I could taste something more than the hops kicking the crap out of my taste buds but honestly I can't. I chose this to be my only beer last night and I am glad I did, I doubt I would be able to taste anything after drinking this. All that may sound negative but the taste was really fantastic, if you don't love hops please don't waste this beer.  Mouthfeel: Close to medium body, not a heavy beer but good body for a huge IPA.  Drinkability: While one did me in, it was a monday evening and had it been a weekend I could have handled a few over the course of a day.  Overall I must admit I am a huge Stone fan, they have never disappointed me and this one was another great offering from them. If you dig the hops and like their regular IPA you will certainly like this.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,RoBotGod,4.46,"This is one of those beers that I picked up knowing it was going to be good. It came through with flying colors. There is a great copper tone they got out of the malt. The hops were huge on it. It leaves behind a thick shag carpeting of lime green hops on your tongue. For how loud the hops our the finish of the beer is smooth. It leaves a thick malt taste instead of the citrus burn that you get from some strong IPAs. After taking a second glance, the beer taste darker then copper tones lead you to believe. This is the professional of IPAs.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,phisig137,4.31,"Pours a pale straw color with a 2 finger head that disappates quickly. Minimal lacing. Suprizingly looks to be a ""fizzy yellow beer"" as Stone so eloquently put it.  Aroma is filled with hops, hops HOPS! Citrus hops in particular dominate the nose, with grassy hops bringing up the rear.  Flavor is again dominated by hops. Pine hops show up here, and blend well with the citrus and grassy hops. A simple backbone of honey like sweetness hold it all together. For being as extreme as this beer tastes, everything is surprizingly balanced. End palate is a solid bitter punch that is well expected after the initial hop-onslaught.  Mouthfeel is solid, but drinkability gets docked a point or two. The bittering hops take a toll towards the end of the bottle.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,wingnutter,4.34,"Thanks SethB2 for the bomber  Pours a CRYSTAL clear, deep golden/amber color. Poured into a DFH pint glass...Thick eggshell colored head that converts to a fine film on top. Minimal lacing.  I could smell it the second I popped the top. A nice combo of hops, floral notes, citrus, pine, and a noticable sweetness that I cant exactly place...grapefruit maybe...Excellent aroma! Very strong.  Taste: Like getting hit by a speeding hop train. A ton of hops with a nice sweet/sourness that I havent tasted in a IIPA before...Stone never disappoints in the hop department. Very tasty brew...I wish the ABV was a tad higher but this is definately one of the better IIPAs Ive had. Surprisingly light mouthfeel for the style - doesnt feel thick as alot of my favorite IIPAs, but the taste is huge and it goes down really easy. Warming up a bit more sweetness comes through with some tropical-like citrus thing happening...Maybe pineapple!??!!?!? Dry, bitter hop finish, which is how I like em. A great quencher. This badboy begs to be slugged, not sipped.  Drinkability is very high due to the subdued ABV. I could knock back a few of these before I knew it. Stone has done it again - Im a fan of everything hoppy of theirs that I have tried. This is no exception. I only hope that one day soon Stone makes it down to Florida.  This beer is pretty arrogant in its own right. Thumbs UP!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,wedge,4.4,"Clean brassy gold with a thin persistent white head that loosly clings to the glass. Sparce, tiny carbonation. Citrus hop perfume aroma - light, sweet fruits and some very slight toasted malt with just a hint of spicy alcohol. Huge oily hop flower flavor. Sweet citrus pulp over faint malts. Bitter waves of hops...its all about the hops. Full, rich flavor that doesn't stop. Long lasting crushing bitterness - warming, full, and slick yet ultimately dry. Insane and intense yet intriguing.  An absolute assault on the senses. The bottle is practically exploding with hops. Ruinous? I can't feel my tongue. Make this one the last beer of the day.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,tastybeer,4.52,"Appearance is golden amber with a dense white head. Clear but thick. Nice white surface throughout the duration. Aroma of liquid hops, thick sap, fresh pine, and fresh crushed tropical flowers. Juicy sugared grapefruits. Alcohol and candy smells parallel each other. Taste is loaded with hop oils. Candied hops followed by... every other kind of hops with a prolonged bitter dry and sticky finish. Mouthwatatering sour before the bitter dryness. Mouthfeel is thick and sticky. Just the right amount of carbobonation. Every sip needs the right amount of time to reach the finish which slows down the drinking time but doesn't take away form drinkability.  I need to recuperate before I have another beer. Awesome.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ChillMike,4.82,"Wow I can't even begin to explain how much I love this beer...but I'll try  Served in my Stone Ruination Pilsner glass  A: It pours a beautiful golden red color that has a nice almost white head that leaves very nice lacing. Very pretty beer.  S: Wow before you even taste this you know you're in for a ride the hopps hit your nose like a Mac Truck it also has a nice pine smell to it as well.  T: The important part right? Wow If you dont' like a really hoppy beer don't even bother with this. This is a hop-head's dream, it flows over the tounge with a surge of bitterness, but still ends up really tasty. Wow I can't get over this.  M: I don't hold much weight in this category as long as I can drink it and the taste is good this doesn't matter much. Anyways Not too watery and not too sludgy a nice balance between the two.  D: Seeing as I've only found it in bombers it's a toss up. I do have a huge tolerance for alcohol, but even so one of these gets me warm and two I'm definitely feeling it. Even so it's a very easy drink in my opinion because I really like the taste of it. You just have to be careful on how much you drink.   So in conclusion everyone say it with me now, ""I AM VERY BITTER AND I LIKE IT!""",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Blakaeris,4.5,Pours hazy dark gold with a creamy head.  Smell is strong hops with strong citrus and fruit notes.  Taste is very grassy citrus hop backed up with a pleasant tangerine flavor. Sweet carmel malts have enough presense to give this brew a nice balance. Finish is quite dry and lingering.  Mouthfeel is medium full and chewy.  Overall this is a great brew. It has complexity and balance that allows it to go beyond being simply a hop monster.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,bashiba,4.08,"Poured a cloudy orange with a thick creamy head that left great lacing.  Smell is full of strong hop odors with a strong citrusy grapefruit being the most dominant.  Taste is full of strong bitter citrus hops upfront with grapefruit and lemon flavors then mellows into a nice semisweet fruity citrus flavor. The Malt is almost undetectable, very very hop dominated.  Mouthfeel has a nice medium thickness with a good bit of hop oil with a solid dry finish.  A very drinkable Double IPA if you want it totally hop dominated, which sometimes is exactly what I want.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,gdogalishus,3.84,"I'm torn on how to rate this beer for drinkability. First, let me start with the fact that it poured from the bottle into a pint glass with a dark orange brown color with a head that was tinted a white green. The aroma is hops, hops, more hops and then add hops on top of that. The flavor dried my mouth from front to back and sent a bitterness overload to the brain. Holly hop monster batman. I tried to eat food after drinking this beer, but my cheesburger tasted like hops with a meat texture. 20 minutes later and my throat is still dry. Ruination is a good name... it ruined my ability to taste anything after I drank this beer. If you are a hop head, try this... it's a hop monster. If you are not, don't come within 10 feet of this beer. Woof.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ridedammit,4.5,"One of my favorite beers in this category. Before moving up north I had never heard of Stone, I was pleasantly surprised. Even though this is in the Double IPA category, its not done to be the hoppiest, driest, most extreme beer out there. It is entirely drinkable with a nice alcohol mouthfeel. Many beers in this category can go way overboard with hops and/or alcohol, just for the extreme effect, but unless you are into pain, you can maybe get through one. The Ruination can be enjoyed all evening, then you pass out.  Great beer, especially on tap.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,GimmeAles,4.58,"One of my favorites Ive never reviewed (not that it needs another rave!). Pours from the Bomber a pure golden hue, 1-2 finger, semi-rocky head. Lively carbonation keeps a 1cm sheet of meringue sticking all the way down the glass. Classy! Youre greeted with a wall of sour\tart citrus aromas, some evergreen spice and faint yeasty earthiness behind.  Taste is all hops upfront  a tingling barrage of grapefruit and lemons, a winsome malty middle and dry, sour and clean pineapple finish. As it warms, pineapple becomes dominant to me and the malts become sweeter. Through some delicious pain comes the best this beer has to offer: with palette fairly ruined, the complexity of the hops and the deeper, vanilla-sweetness of the malts is revealed. A beer of beautiful 'stages'. The complexity is really enjoyable.  Body is awesome  Mouthfeel is silky and smooth and alcohol presence is detected by an ever-so-slight warming of the throat. The carbonation settles down a bit and helps lighten this hop juice. Dangerous drinkability.  If only I lived in So Cal, I would love to try this on cask at a Stone event. I would also definitely keep a keg close at hand.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,spk154,4.25,"By far the best of the Stone Brewery offerings, which tend to be too ""big"" for my tastes.  The aroma was harsh at first; the hops were extremely apparent with just an undercurrent of evergreen. The first sip was even harsher. However, once your tastebuds have a chance to adjust to the bitterness, the complexity of the beer really comes through. After that, the beer becomes increasingly drinkable. Not a beer to be taken lightly, which is, im my opinion, a hallmark of the entire Stone line-up.  I really enjoyed this brew, despite its ""in your face"" hoppiness, but would not recommend to anyone whose face contorts at the mention of the words ""hops"".",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,bkett01,3.96,"Poured from a 22oz bottle into my pint glass with nearly no head at all. Intrigued by this I took a whiff and WOW.... west coast hop factor, gotta love it. A great fresh piney smell rises out from the pint.  As for taste, I agree with other BA's when they say that this should be the only beer you review for an evening. The hop punch truly ""ruins"" your palate's ablilty to taste any lessor flavors, in a good way. Heavy citric flavors are evident over a mild, yet detectable malt. Stone truly lives up to their well hyped name with this one, it won't let you down.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,SethB2,4.4,"Poured out of a bomber into a pint glass. Has a nice one finger head that disipates, leaving a ton of lacing on the glass. Smell of HOPS and a lot of them. Grapefruit notes dominate. Taste much like the smell. Not a lot of malt balance, but in the case of this beer, it isn't a bad thing. Mouthfeel if medium and oily. Very nice. Drinkability suffers slightly, as many DIPAs do. I just can't drink more than one or two at a sitting. Overall, very good brew.

Cellared for 6 months, we're ready for a tasting.  Appearance- Very nice medium amber/gold color, clear, with a three-finger bone white head. After swirling, it is a glowing apricot orange. Mostly uniformly scaled bubbles pop their way down the glass, leaving sticky lacing. Gobs of patchy residue are left behind.  Smell- Aromas of grapefruit and pine needles jump ebulliently out of the glass, almost too intense for the boundaries of my glass.  Taste- A nice blend of the citrusy, piney hops with a terrific malty backbone that balances quite well. Not even close to the hop monster I was expecting... this drinks pretty easily, and I'm pleasantly surprised with the balance.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Easy and rolling in the mouth. Not the ""beast"" I expected... it's a pretty damn easy drinkin' IPA if you ask me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,BRLockwood,4.45,"A: A light clear golden color with a decent head that seems to last a long while. A decent but not overly carbonated beer. With the decent head retention and good carbonation I would call it very inviting.  S: The smell is definitely of hops! I would call in piney and resiny.  T: Tasty, and hoppy just the way I like it. The was definitely brewed for the hops and they did a good job!  M: Tastes good on the palate, it is light but strong on the hops, not watery but smooth with a good aftertaste. If I had to say something negative I would say it had just a touch too much carbonation.  D: Easy to consume and you can't really tell it has the 7.7% abv.

147,4083,jamesdergen,4.12,"Appearance: Pours a clear honey color with some ruby hints. Head is small but manages to stick around for awhile.  Smell: Very potent herbal hop aroma  Taste: Just like the bottle says, ""A liquid poem to the glory of the hop!"" Very herbal, piney hop flavor with a nutty malt background that does not really balance the brew. Not as aggressive as I thought it would be, but pleasantly hoppy without being overbearing.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth and nicely carbonated. Light-to-medium body. Overall very pleasant.  Drinkability: Surprisingly good. I was expecting a more challenging, aggressive beer but this one is really smooth and drinkable. The alcohol is well-hidden and the hops are not overdone.  I like this beer, but am not impressed enough to go out of my way to buy it again.

147,4083,orfeu,4.7,"Hazy golden peach juice with a not-quite-white 1"" sticky froth. Ridiculous citrus aroma: grapefruit, mandarin, tangerine, lime. There's a certain doughy sweetness present in the scent, too. Grapefruit rind dominates the first sip. Bitter indeed, but certainly not out of line. More floral citrus nuances emerge as the beer warms. And a definite malt sweetness is apparent as well. Medium body, juicy mouthfeel. Maybe I like the hops a little too much, but my tongue isn't numb at all from this. While Ruination is a hop showcase, I wouldn't claim that it is at all out of balance. In fact, it's quite measured, all things considered. If it wasn't, it wouldn't be so damn easy to drink. Kick-ass bottle art, to boot.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Boto,4.42,"22oz. bomber: This one pours a slightly hazy, slightly orangish darker golden color. There was a fair sized white head that drops off somewhat quickly. The aroma is definitely hoppy. It is a good mix, with notes of pine, grapefruit, orange. The taste is quite good. The hopiness is right upfront and strong, but not as overpowering as I thought this one might be. Medium malt body behind the hops, but you cant taste it at all. There are a few that are better, but you can get this one most anywhere.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BeerRun13,4.39,This awesome DIPA pours golden to orange with a small white head that lasts. Good lace is left on the sides of the glass. Ruination has a wonderfully hoppy/floral/perfumy aroma. The flavor is strong and hoppy with mellow malty notes behind and follwed with a bitterness that rests in the back of the mouth. This very hoppy brew bubbles throughout the mouth... you could almost feel the hops... and again the bitterness is left. This is the beer that really got me into hop bitterness and flavor.

The taste is strong and hoppy also. Dank hops, the malt is lightly sweet but overpowered by hop flavor. The finish is quite bitter, but you don't realize how bitter until later on when it is still lingering on the tongue. Very bubbly, smooth and rich, it is medium thick and has a nice crispness to it. I felt is was pretty drinkable, especially for hopheads. I would have expected a little more balance but I don't think Stone was really going for that anyway.

147,4083,JoeyHotrod,4.9,"What a tremendous beer! This is not for the faint of heart and non hop heads, need not apply.  Golden cloudy appearance with a nice thick foamy head that lingers and lingers, leaving a nice lacing that lasts throughout the glass.  The smell... man where to begin. Hugely citrus first and foremost. One would only have to smell this, to know that they are in for a hop infused implosion. In addition to the afermentioned cirtus, there is everything from pine, to floral notes. Truly a smorgasbord of aroma.  Taste... HOPS! Huge huge hops. Make no bones about it they are there and in full force. If ones really really tries, they might pick up the slightest hint of malt and a ever so slight alchohol taste.... but this is hopped up to the degree, that nothing's breaking through those hops.  I told myself not to ever give anything straight fives, but this sure came close to accomplishing the impossible. If you love hops, you owe it to yourself to try this beer at least once.  Kudos to Greg Koch and everyone at Stone for this one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,badturtle,4.82,"I think I have a favorite beer now. I smelled the bottle after opening and was amazed. It was a complex scent for an IPA. It poured a wonderful dark golden color with a light, quickly fading head. Make sure you drink while there is still some head. The additional flavors you'll get from smelling the head as you drink are amazing. Besides the hops, I noticed citrus flavors. It reminded me of an orange bubble gum I had as a kid. Neither the beer nor the gum tasted much like oranges, but there was a hint of it. The only thing holding back the drinkability is the alcohol content. If this beer was around 5-6%, I could drink it all night. At 7.7%, one is probably enough.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Taste is hops of course, but also a good blst of citrus, hops are not overwhelming, but they are the main flavor. There has to be a decent amount of malt, but it is definitely in the backseat.

T: Tastes of citrus comes first then a nice bitterness that starts at the back of your tongue and moves towards the front of your mouth.  M & D: Mouthfeel is smooth and refreshing.

The smell is tough to describe, no real over the top hops, best I can describe the smell is musty. Taste is great, hops and fruit are very detectable and goes down real smooth. I could probably drink 2 bombers of this one but I would hope to do so at home or with a DD as its got quite an undetectable alcohol kick to it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The aroma is powerful - it jumps right out at you, a nice blend of soft citrusy hops, some woodiness and slight mustiness, and heavy malt, with a touch of esters. The flavor is powerful too; the hop bitterness and flavor coat your tongue and compliment the maltiness perfectly, and you also get hints of cherry, caramel, and alcohols. Very drinkable.

Smells of hops (obviously) and pine forest with a trace of citrus. As the beer warms the citrus is more defined, grapefruit. I did note a citric acid feel on the tongue. Bitter hop finish, but not wholly unpleasant.  Overall, this is a well crafted IPA.

147,4083,SupaCelt,4.3,"This beer is golden orange in Appearance. It forms a resilient and creamy beige coloured head and produces sheets of sticky lace. There are plentiful amounts of carbonation. The second pour is mostly the same except with a larger but less dense head.  The Nose has a vague caramel malt base with an aromatic bouquet of grassy, herbal, and pine resinous hop character. Maybe a bit of grapefruit, but very grassy and fresh overall. Concentrated green hoppiness. Not alot of fruitiness. Hop driven.  The Taste is sweet and juicy with a dry and bitter finish. Not a fruity sweetness, but a sugary sweetness. There is just enough malt to properly carry a double credential without falling into the trap of sickening sweetness. Hops are bitter and drying to the palate with earthy and green notes of grass and sap. The hop aspects are definitely the most pronounced feature of this beer. They linger on and occupy most of the flavour time.  Mouthfeel is medium. The beer is carbonated well and of an appropriate thickness.  Drinkability is good for the style. Respect is due and caution should be exercised. This beer is certainly good but I think I expected more after the standard IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The beauty of this flavor is how the these two are seamlessly blended into one another. It's just fantastic.  The mouth feel is very smooth with a light carbonation that effervesces on the tongue.  Highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Tupperwolf,4.5,"Pours the color of peaches and copper from a 22oz'er with no date. Creamy yellow-white head a finger thick that slowly fades to a bubbly, full coating and leaves behind a full wall of sticky, permanent lace.  So much hop in the smell! Such a nice thing to stick my nose into. Big grapefruit scents with just a touch of, to my surprise, espresso in the background; Plums, lime, lots more grapefruit tartness.  Taste - What a kick! So much tart on the beginning with a sleek bitter middle and lots and lots of orange peel finish. Blackcurrants on the aftertaste. Lots of hops, DUH. I like this so much more than Stone's own (totally non-IPA) Levitation Ale, which I found to be way too bitter. The malt and hop profile in this beer is awesome. It's not overwhelming at all but you know you're drinking a hop-oriented brew. Very flavorful!  Mouthfeel is good, a little swishy with lots of tight carbonation. A nice buttery-citrus peel clinging aftertaste. Some alcohol noted, good balancing act.  For an IPA - sorry, 'double IPA' - this is totally drinkable. Alcohol and bitterness become more noticeable as it warms. One more please!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,deuschbag,4.72,"wow. it's been quite some time since i've had this. man has my palate changed(for the better). this beer pours a very nice deep golden/light copper color with a nice white head that lasts quite a while. the smell is such a lovely scent of sweet hops. damn this smells wonderfull. when the first time i had this beer, i thought it was good, but really bitter. but now..wow. i've developed the taste of the lovely hops. boy they are all over the place on this one. a slight bitterness at first but not that much. the rest is just beautiful sweetness hops. damn, i really did not expect to like this beer that much, but wow.i have been ""permanently ruined"" by this beer. absolutly wonderful.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Derek,4.43,"A: Golden-bronze, quite clear. Fluffy off-white head, great retention, nice lace. Exceptional. What more could you want?  S: Fresh hops, citrous and pine, but it also has an earthy aroma, that's a lot more British-like than its 'little' IPA brother (not nearly as citrousy). Maybe some Goldings in this one?  T: Predominantly hop flavour, citrous, pine and earth. It's a little over-the-top, but it's quite pleasant (not harsh). It's balanced with a chewy, bready malt flavour. The bitterness is assertive, but its quite smooth, and very appealing.  M: Moderate to full body is slightly oily and acidic. The carbonation is moderately high (it keeps making head!).  D: It's good, but the abundance of hop flavour and assertive bitterness limits consumption.  World-class brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,masikon,4,"I went into this brew questioning whether my palate would be able to handle it. Up until now I've been a malt man, prefering the earthy malts to the spicy piny hops...but i think my palate has finally matured. This was fantastic, pouring a transparent amber hue with a healthy white head on top. Smells of pure hoppy pine and spice, although a very moderate malty backgroud is persent. Tasted how it smells, like having a handful of hop buds in your mouth, oily and Uber-flavorful, but always balanced out by the perfect amount of malt which adds a biscuit like background. Like the bread in a hop sandwhich I guess. Really top notch, If I drink this in another six months I wouldn't be surprised if I gave it a 5.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,clabaugh,4.75,"Appearance: Pours a hazy honey-orange with a creamy, almost fluffy, eggshell head. The lacing is lovely, coating the glass with an admirable persistence.  Smell: Loads and loads of oily hops invigorate the nostrils. This one really opens the sinuses. Some malty sweetness accompanies the hops to produce a pleasant dichotomy.  Taste: Sharp, biting hoppiness asserts itself at once. Nicely balanced with the malts, which embody a flavor of cake. Hints of citrus rind accentuate the hoppy, sweet backbone of this beer. A lot of complex flavor (even some honeysuckle?) characterizes this beer. Quite delicious in any case.  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied for a double IPA. Ruination offers a great consistency and tongue sensations. Not too much carbonation, but a warming alcohol presence. It just lingers on the palate in very impressive way.  Drinkability: Highly drinkable. Delightful to taste, not overly bitter, and tolerable alcohol content. Thanks be to the beer gods that this one comes in a bomber! Sheer bliss.  Notes: Ruination, jubilation, is there a difference? Superb presentation (bad ass looking gargoyle on the bottle), top-notch flavor, and just about all I want in a beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,becktone,4.18,"This beer pours a great golden color. The head is very large and in charge. About a one inch head to begin with that slowly becomes smaller. Still a large head though, the foam is creamy and white in color. Large amounts of lacing. Very good head retention. The beer is crystal clear and looks very alive due to carbonation.  Very strong aroma on this brew. The moment I cracked the top on this bottle, nay, 'ere I even had the cap off I was entrigued by the wonderful aroma of this beer. Its aroma reminds me of flowers and I can detect no malt aroma in this beer, well nothing strong enough to smell anyway.  The taste of this IPA is very good. I really do appreciate the complex flavor of this beer. This beer is all about the hops. My palate is not as educated and experienced as many people's may be but, I have to say that I really only taste the hops in this beer. I don't taste any malt influence though. The taste is exceptional and is full of complex hop flavor. Just as with the aroma it has a flowery like flavor, typical of an IPA, tastes like the regular Stone IPA to me. Still I think I appreciate this one a bit more, it has a better overall appearance, smell and taste.  The mouthfeel of this beer is just as good as the rest of this beer. In my opinion it is lighter on the palate, the feel of it is quite like water, light. The carbonation which appeared to be over the top from the look of the beer after the pour is complementary to the style. There is not too much, rather there is just enough to make you notice that you are drinking a carbonated beverage. I would definitely buy this beer again, however I probably will buy the regualar Stone IPA because for the amount of money this bomber costs I think that I would be better off in the long run with buying a sixer of the regular IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,edmundfitzoil,4.47,"Stone Ruination IPA in a brown, 22 oz. ""bomber bottle"" boasting ""A liquid poem to the glory of the hop!"" The bottle had no best by or bottled on date. I poured mine into a snifter.  The beer poured a beautiful orange amber color with a short quarter in or so of white head. The beer's carbonation appeared to be moderate. The nose was of incredible hoppiness. It beckons me on and taunts me. The flavor was of a great surprise, while expecting a completely overpowering hop bomb, the malt character of this beer greatly balances it. The beer finished with wonderful hop dryness. Upon putting the beer on the palate the carbonation proves to be less than at first glance. A clear, crispness to this beer leaves a hoppiness lingering on the tongue and beckoning me on. For the 7.7% ABV, this beer is insanely drinkable. This could be trouble.  With great expectations I came to this beer, and with even greater respect I have finished this bottle. Big props to Stone, for they have truly proved what the hype is all about with this beer.  Note: Even the hoppy burps taste good with this.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,fisherman34,4.47,"Light orange/amber in colour with medium carbonation. Huge citrusy hop aroma, with some interesting green (almost minty) notes in the background. Bracing, but not at all harsh, bitterness. Loads of complex citrus flavor notes: lemon, manderin orange and grapefruit. Minor notes of pine and black pepper. The malt component of the flavor profile is surprisingly clean. Somewhat light bodied for an IIPA, but in a really nice way that makes the beer even more drinkable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The nose is intense and amazingly hoppy- fresh-cut whole hops, with that american citrus and pine aroma. There is a just a hint of sweet caramel malt flavor to properly balance the taste, but mostly just alpha hop oil obliteration. The carbonation is tiny and scarce, but the body is light; and that keeps the mouthfeel smooth enough to retain a good drinkability. The aftertaste turns grassy while the orange peel and pine cone flavors all meld together to form a dry and bitter finish, full of complex flavor but never overwhelming.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,hero27,4.49,"22oz bomber.  I still have vivid memories of the first time I tried this extreme brew. It was about two years previous (sometime in 2003), and I bought a bottle off Liquidsolutions because I thought..hell, the bartender told me Sierra Nevada Pale ale was ""hoppy"" and I liked that..let's give this a try. The night I tasted Ruination for the first time, ""hoppy"" turned out to be the understatement of the century. I think I woke up three weeks later and burped up a little hops..and I distinctly remember not tasting the burger I had for dinner that night. Two years later, I've returned to try this again, and finally figured I'd better rate it.  A double IPA by all respects, this beer has a very fresh hop aroma, with floral and citrus hops mixing to create a hop lover's fantasy..pure, unrelenting hoppiness. Tastes are obvious in-your-face floral hops, but with a very surprising malt support as well...well in the background, but it's there. Piney hops continue to harass the tastebuds with every sip, as you begin to understand the lyrical rant on the back of the bottle.  Overall, this is just a downright incredible assault on the tastebuds, and every so-called hophead needs to have this near (or at) the top of their list if they haven't tried it yet. Amazing hop aroma, incredible hop flavor, and another blatently kick ass offering from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The head was an off white nearing on two inches. Sadly the head was not to last. The head came down like a collapsed soufle eventually settling into a thin white foam. No lacing was left behind on the glass.  Smell: Smells floral, woody pine, swiming on a citrus fruity base.  Taste: Leads with floral woodyness going into some malty sweetness. This immediately snaps back into bitter hoppy spiceyness.  Mouthfeel: This beer is meduim plus bodied. There is a slightly buttery feel to the mouth. This has totally wrecked my taste buds for the night.  Drinkability: This is a very drinkable IPA.

The smell of hops pervades the room. Mmmmm, hops. The taste, however, is something of a letdown. Yummy, hoppy, yes. But amazing? I mean, sure, my mouth is all cottony and the hops are present, but what sets this beer apart from the pack? It lacks the balance of Dreadnaught, the subtle beauty of Dogfished 90mins, and the raw, unbalanced hop appeal of Hoppin' Ottin. It exists somewhere in the middle neather regions and I ask why? This is the Point lager of IPAs: Sure, it is head-and-shoulders above the rest, but for as much, perhaps a buck more, perhaps a few bucks less, I can get better.

Poured from a 22oz bomber into a 0.5l stein appears a light copper with good clarity for an unfiltered brew. ¾ inch white head that leaves good lacing. Bouquet is very floral but not excessively so. When discussing the taste it is logical to start with the hops, which are indeed powerful; yes, dominating too but not overpowering. There are good caramel-like malt qualities too. As the beer rises in temperature (my serving was perhaps a bit cold to start), the malt flavors become more pronounced, and the alcohol begins to warm the palate, giving an almost medicinal quality to an exceedingly dry IPA. The mouthful is very round, almost creamy, finishing very dry and quenching.

147,4083,Jarod,4.5,"1 pint and 6 oz bomber bottle, brown with no bottled on date, just remarks on the IBU This beer was aged at least 1 1/2 years. This beer poured a golden yellow color that was clear at first pour then became progressively cloudy with each pour, which is to be expected, and was well carbonated. The foam that was produced was almost white with shades of an off white/cream color. It was thick and creamy in nature and sticky, it did not last very long which surprised me, and would like to have had it last deeper into the glass. Some lace was noticeable, but nothing really outstanding. The aromas that came from the glass were outstanding and very complex, tons of hop aromas, pine trees, citrusy notes (grapefruits), roasted malts, fruit, and hints of alcohol. The flavors were even better. The first flavors that hit your tongue are a creamy thick malt flavor, kind of toasted, then warming notes of alcohol are felt, fruits (pineapples, pears and grapefruits), then the hops - oh the hops - oh the flavors - herbs, citrus, flowers, fresh grass, pine trees, - oh the medly of flavors. All the flavors seem to blend together like 2 dancers. This beer finishes bready yeast and warming alcohol. Aftertaste was a melody of malts, hops, and bread, but warm from the smooth alcohol. The body was medium. Over all, a really really good beer, a must staple in the fridge. Stone knows how to brew a beer. Seems aging this beer mellowed it just slightly, one of the best out there. Nice and smooth.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,swid,4.18,"Beer #5 (of 13) from my beer purchase in Indiana.  Stone Ruination IPA pours a copper-gold color into my class. Atop the ever-so-slightly-hazy liquid sits a 1"", off-white head, which slowly collapses. Low carbonation, high lacing. It's a thing of beauty. The aroma is of hops, pure and simple; it's like having a fresh hop leaf in your glass. (There is a sweet malt/alcohol presence, too, it's just that the hops are so overwhelmingly dominant).  The taste is just what the aroma promises - bold, brash, and hoppy. The hoppiness has a strong citrus element to it. There's just enough sweetness available from the malt and the alcohol to provide a shred of balance. The mouthfull is slightly wet, moderately full, and somewhat acidic and sour. Finishes crisp, quite bitter, and with a lingering citric aftertaste.  This beer is about as all-out as it gets. It's big, it's hoppy, it's flavorful. I now understand why this beer is so well-loved on BA - it's hophead nirvana. Definitely worth checking out.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,EStreet20,4.62,"22 ounce bomber bottle which reminds me how this beer will ruin my ability to drink lesser beers. Poured into a DFH oversized wine glass.  A - Pours a bright golden color with a nice thick foamy two finger white head sitting atop it. Some light gets through. Nice lacing from the head after each sip. A great looking IPA.  S - You can smell the hops as you pour. A mix of piny and floral hops. Now for the initial whiff, stick your face in a pine tree while squeezing lemons and oranges. It really has an overpowering pine/citrus smell that is purely relentless. Everything a hophead wants to smell while looking into a beer glass.  T - This beer is a pure hop monster. From the initial sip the hops hit hard, then a tiny, tiny, tiny bit of maltiness tries to creep through. It is here that the hops (very citric with a nice touch of pine and the littles bit of floral hop flavor at the end of the whole rush) bitch slap the malt back a few feet. The aftertaste is a bitterness that is simply brilliant. Definitely a great taste experience.  M - Very nice, not huge on carbonation but just enough to keep the huge hops from being sticky and nasty (sorry no other word I could think of) in your mouth. Very good.  D - I think this might be my first 5 for drinkabilty. Mainly because this beer has its own taste that makes you want more. Plus, it tastes great which makes you want more. Last, I think the extreme bitterness eradicates any true ""aftertaste"" that this beer has. Thus, it makes you want to go for another sip to experience the hop punch again. Extremely well done.  Notes: This is my favorite IPA and one of my top three beers now. However I should note that if a non hophead were to review this every score except appearance would probably be reversed. This is a beer for hopheads only!!! I could see my friends who drink crap beer simply spitting this out, and even craft beer drinkers who prefer a lot of malty goodness finding this beer over the top with the bitterness. Oh well, glad I'm a member of the middle ground, who can enjoy malt monsters and complete hop bombs. I'll drink this one any day of the week.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,rhoadsrage,4.3,"(Served in an imperial pint glass)  A- This beer pours a crisp clear light coppery body with a rock yellowish-white head that last for awhile. A nice gentle carbonation of tiny bubbles rises to the surface.  S- During the pour, the smell of green floral hops fills the air. The faint smell of pineapple, and a hint of green grass give the hops good depth. The smell of pale malt give a nice balance to the hops.  T- The burst of green hops with citrus and a hint of pineapple are very powerful. The finish is a nice hop bitterness with a slight alcohol taste to really accentuate the hop bitterness. The hops almost have a sour spicy note to them in the finish.  M- The mouthfeel is medium-full but there is no real alcohol warmth.  D- This beer is bold if nothing else. It has a nice big flavors and some faint complexity to the hops.

Huge odor... mounds of citrus and orange peel, with a healthy dose of a hops... wonderful.  Not as big of a flavour as I expected from this one... but the flavour that is there is breathtaking. Loads of citrus, and a grassy flavour derived from the hops. Also, unlike many DIPA's I've tasted, this one is beautifully balanced, with enough of a malt backbone so that the hops don't entirely overwhelm your palate.  Active on the tongue, but with enough weight to it that it doesn't seem too ""crisp"". Just about what I was looking for here.  Very drinkable for a DIPA... surprisingly gentle on the palate.... all in all a wonderful brew that I wish I had easier access to.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Oxymoron,4.67,"The smell is sweet with malt and noteable hop presence. A good sweet caramel malt flavor that is firsted noticed. But it makes way for a citrus hop backbone with almost a musty characteristic to it. One thing to notice is take a whiff of the beer before you try it, as once you taste it then you won't smell anything afterwards.  The taste is a kick to the taste buds. Hop-tastic for sure. The bitter hops are the first think to kick up. A strong precence with some mellow earthy tones mixed with razor citrus zing. The bittering flavor lasts throughout the tasting and competes with other tastes till the end. A caramel malt base is the next taste but is really overwhelmed by the hops. It brings a good base to the beer and as your mouth adjust to the hops it balances everything well. Last is the citrus floral taste that has a bigger piney flavor. When the floral and bitter hops mix at the end, it leaves a tart almost grapefruit flavor to the aftertaste. A great fully hopped beer.  The beer is not overly oily as some big hop beers can be, but there are hints of the hop taste in the aftertaste. A good tangy and somewhat tart flavor that can almost be described as chalky. But still good.  An exceptional hop-tastic beer. For a double I would have liked more malt but for a beer it is a not-to-miss experience.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Ahhdball,3.2,"Good copper color, with a full white head topping the pour. Oily residue indicated a nice hop presence and it wasn't joking. Smelled huge hops with a slight bitter fruit but that's it. Man is this sucker bitter. I love hops but this isn't anything like I expected. Hops, and grapefruit and even then the bitterness of the hops was too powerfull. Not even close to balanced. Mouthfeel was slick and chewy but the stinging hops almost kept me from finishing it. I'd love to give this another shot sometime just becuase I love Stone beers but I may be hard pressed to do so. I hope this was a bad batchor something.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,auntfloyd,4.13,"Served from a cold 22oz bomber into an official Stone Ruination IPA 17oz mug. Ruination IPA pours a hazy light orange color with a thick head, which leaves quite a lacing on the glass. The smell announces what you should already know if you'd read the (rather long) text on the silk-screened bottle: this is a hop lovers beer, (I'd append ""plain and simple,"" were it not the case that Ruination, like all Stone brews, is hardly ""plain"" or ""simple""). The nose is pure hops, with traces of citrus, very much an IPA. The preliminaries out of the way, let's move on to the most important part.  Stone is known for creating big ales, full of flavor and character (some would say overwhelmingly so, but I digress), and Ruination IPA is no exception. The initial flavor is full-on hops, which mellows into strong, somewheat sweet maltiness. The flavor is bitter, but well-balanced. If you don't like bitter beers, particularily IPAs, this might not be the beer for you, although it's definitely something everyone should experience.  The place where Ruination IPA lets you down is in the feel; it has a slightly oily consistency which makes drinking it not as easy as other beers (though perhaps not moreso than other beers of its class). Definitely not an every day beer.  Ruination IPA is, like all Stone beers, anything but routine. If you, like me, are a fan of IPAs (probably my favorite style beer), then you simply must try this ale if you get the chance. If IPAs, especially double IPAs like Ruination, aren't your thing, you probably won't like it, simply because it's sort of the ""Spinal Tap"" amp of IPAs -- it takes everything about them and cranks it to an 11. Also, it's very likely to overwhelm you're non-craft beer drinking friends. Stone also brews another IPA, the Stone IPA, which I think is actually the better of the two,",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,nephlim,4.64,"Wow! I was a bit frightened by the whole ""ruination"" tag. I think the only IPA I had before this was Ipswitch. Fear not.  This is a hoppy bear, no doubt. However, it is not as bitter as one might think. I got tons of hopps in the nose and the taste, but there was lots of fuit; blueberry to be exact, with other citrus notes. Bitter, but no worse than a strong Italian coffee. Nice head, nice lacing. It's smell is intoxicating.  A friend of mine that drinks pabst blue ribbon split the bottle with me and loved it.

I think it was even a little tart at one point. This is sold in a 22 oz. bomber bottle, and I think you need that much beer to appreciate all the different flavors it offers. The citrus flavors go way beyond just being lemony--they impart a set tastes so complex that they are hard to catalog. The smell is terrific too. It's floral and grainy, really pleasant.  The hops taste remains throughout. It's dry and grassy, but the hops also work with the malts to impart so many other flavors that the beer never becomes overly bitter, even after a full 22 ounces. I say that it is never overly bitter, true, but it toes the line at times, limiting how quickly you'll want to swig this awesome brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Hagbard,4.4,"Poured from a 22 oz bomber, Ruination sits in my Stone IPA glass a nice clear golden color. A thick and rocky white head forms, filling the empty space of the glass. It's a very pretty presentation. As the head dissipates a great deal of lacing is left on the sides of the glass. The aroma is the first of the many intense sensory experiences this beer delivers. A huge grapefruit and citrus fruit aroma greets your nose with a very intense bitterness lying in the background. There is also a very apparent strong malt backbone that holds the whole beer up. The taste hits you like a freight train. Grapefruit and other citrusy fruits lead the charge followed by an intense bitterness. Underlying all this is a wonderfully nuanced malt base that is the equal of the intense hops. As intense as the hops and resulting bitterness are, it never seems harsh or abrasive. It just has the devestating, enamel-dissolving, tongue smacking, eye watering, tooth itching, tastebud killing, skin quivering hoppiness that hopheads adore and crave. For a beer this powerful, it is awfully drinkable. 22 ozs down the shoot before I know it, but the 7.7% catches up to me fast!

It is exactly what it sets out to be. ""A liquid poem to the glory of the hop"". Lots of citrus and piney flavors, but not simply a grapefuit blast like some other West Coast IPAs I have had. Yep, if you love hops, this beer rocks!  Mouthfeel is tart, tangy, not overly thin, even somewhat syrupy. None of the ""tooth enamel-stripping"" qualities as seen on other IPAs and DIPAs that are out there.  Drinkability is exceptional.

After a ten minute wait (no exaggeration!), I was able to pour the last 1/3 of the bottle into the glass. This foam is just insanely dense. It doesn't fade away quite so much as collapse in the center, with the sides holding it up. Just sheets of pure styrofoam almost. And lacing? You can't see through the sides of the glass as the beer level drops. Nothing else compares.  Smells *very* intensely of pine, just overwhelmingly so. Think ""pine-sol."" I could actually taste hops when I smelled this beer. This fully prepares me to just not like this beer. And now I see the ""100+ IBU"" stamped on the back of the bottle.  And, what do you know, it's pretty damn good. Has a dry crispness to it just after the malts that almost reminds me of a tripel. And then the hops step in, and it's just pure pine trees and grapefruits. There's no way you can taste anything other than hops when you're drinking this, I don't care what food you pair it with. This is hop juice, pure and simple. Yeah, there's a bit of malt up front, some nice light, airy sweetness. But the hops beat it to the ground, and send it home without any lunch money. Just gorgeous.  This feels pretty thin on the lips, and thickens only marginally as it works its way back. Carbonation is evident throughout.  If you're a masochist, or a hophead (is there a difference?), this is your brew. Just a super-bitter aftertaste, you'll need something either sweet or pretty neutral to eat with this, or you'll have a hard time finishing it. But oh those hops keep calling you, and you drink more when you know you shouldn't.  This was just too much hop juice for my gut. I was pretty sure if I finished the last few swallows I'd be sick.  ...but I was sorely tempted.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,SteveO1231,4.42,"Awesome! Bar far the hoppiest beer I've ever had. Bright golden yellow color white a thick foamy white head. Nice lacing I could smell the hops before I even stuck my face in the pint glass. Strong hoppy scent, almost like Simple Green it's so powerful. The first sip was like a pop in the mouth, so bitter. The finish was actually a little smoother and sweet. Very nice Double IPA. I don't think I could pound a bunch of these but I could do a couple pints. It's true, it really does ruin your palate, so don't plan on tasting any other beers afterwords.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,gotbeer,4.5,"This is one hoppy monster of a beer.  The appearance is a cloudy amber with a good head that laces the glass heavily.  The smell is herbal, flowery, and citric.  The taste hits you with hops and lots of citrus flavors. Not too bitter, but definitely hoppy. There is some toasted malt flavors in the middle to balance things out before the hops obiterate your tastebuds. The mouthfeel is smooth as can be, and very drinkable. This beer hides it's ABV well.  Overall, a very, very impressive Double IPA. An absolute must try.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ReebShorts,4.48,"Gorgeous thick tan head, covering a light brown, cloudy beverage, with noticeable but not overwhelming carbonation making it's way to the surface.  Aroma is hops, floral spice, citrus fruit (maybe orange, grapefruit, tangerine..), and I detect some underlying toasted malt.  Tasty, I expected no less based off the appearance and aroma. Hops are definately at the forefront of this one, but it is kept under control by the other ingredients. I've tasted ""hoppier"" doubles, than this, but this one is top notch as it manages to find good balance in a category that is inherently un-balanced. Still not for the faint of hops though.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mentor,4.02,"Bottle obtained from Total Beverage (Colorado) a couple days ago. Pours a lushious clumpy light tan two finger head over a nearly clear rust (lightly browned) liquid. The smell during the pour in really enticing. Wet sweet with piney floral hops and mango. Some kind of frutiy ester mixes with the hop sting to make a really delicous aroma. To the nose, the fruity esters predominate over the hops, which are pithy piney. Peaches, oranges, honey malt. Tastes...hoppy bitter initially seems high, but then the thickness of the beer steps in and the bitter gets long in the tangle. Grapefruit pith is so strong it almost stings. It leaves the mouth with an chalky aspirin-like dryness. Behind the hops is the malt sweet. Noticable mostly, but poking it's head up for a view on occassion. Fruity esters are difficult to find. Peaches may be there, lost behind the hop bites. Thick chewy syrupy body with moderate carbonation. The aftertaste is flat out grassy hop bitter, accompanied by a touch of heartburn. Fairly enjoyable, but I don't need any more. The malt is so far below the hops that this beer is way out of balance. That's kinda to style, but not particularly drinkable. Vastly over-rating, IMO.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,qwert59,4.23,"Stone Ruination IPA pours a pleasing golden-amber color, with very light carbonation. Not a whole ot of head, and the head that is there settles very quickly, but it did leave nice lacing on the glass.  Not surpisingly, I smelled hops. And then more hops. The hops are very piney, with a nice touch of citrus.  The taste is massive. The taste is bitter, hops, very piney, but good. It reminds me of getting a back rub that's too hard; it doesn't make sense why, but it still feels really good.  This beer didn't let me forget I'd tasted it. It leaves a very strong after taste, and a slight film on the tounge, which kinds of dried my mouth out, but then I immediately wanted more. It has a thicker mouthfeel than most IPAs. Ruination IPA is also very drinkable for a beer of this magnitude, even though it's dried my mouth out.  One of the nice things about this beer is that it could stand up to spicy food. I think this beer would be great with anything hot, because I don't think there's any food hot enough to overpower this beer. I like a lot of hot food, so sometimes it's hard to have a beer with dinner, cause not every beer can stand up to a meal that makes you tear up, but Ruination can.  Overall, I think this one of my favorites. I've had it before, twice in the bottle and once on draft. Every other time I'd tried it, it blew me away, and it didn't disappoint tonight.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Shaw,4.8,"I brought some more Ruination back to Florida from my trip to San Diego. Tonight I wanted to celebrate, seeing how I just finished a big project at work. Let's see how the beer compares to the bottles I had last year ...  It pours a beautiful amber color, very clear, with small bubbles and a lovely foamy head. Very nice.  The smells is great. It's hoppy: floral and citrus notes abound. This smell reminds me of California and all their great hoppy brews.  What a taste! Wonderful hop bitterness is of course the main flavor. And what a flavor it is. But there are some nice sweet notes from the malt. The aftertaste is a teeth-cracking bitterness. It's fantastic.  The body is very good. The higher ABV no doubt assists with this beer's smooth, glass-like mouthfeel. It glides over my tongue.  To show how good this beer is, consider that it's very, very drinkable despite the massive 100+ IBUs.  Hell yes! This is the best Stone beer I've had, and they make some damn good beers. For those of us in the East, seek out this beer. You won't be disappointed.  Note: I see I've given it a bit higher score than before and that pushed this beer to my No. 2 spot at the moment. Either my tastes have changed or I got a fresher bottle this time, although I would imagine this beer could age well.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,EPseja,4.36,"Yeah! My 100th beer review... and a friggin' crazy killer beer to celebrate with...  Kickin' gargoyle, gold and green texture-screened in negative onto on a 22oz. bottle. Nice presentation! Very cool bottle. Served into a Duvel tulip (my favorite tasting glass) at just above fridge temperature.  A - Pours a very faintly hazy, thick golden-orange color with a sticky, tacky head. Barely any movement inside the glass. Head drops to a thin mat after a few minutes. Lacing is spotty at best.  S - WHAM the scent hits like a delicious Mack truck loaded down with hops. Sweet citrus; grapefruit dominant. Definitely pineapple. Dried kiwi fruit. Lemonhead candy... or is it the crystal sugar bottom of a Marino's Lemon Italian Ice? Oily pine-sap in lesser amounts. Light malts. Bold as hell. Constantly improving as the temperature rises. Wonderful.  T - The first thing that you get is like poor Ralphie's punishment for cursing -- perfumed soap in the mouth. Instantly bitter -- even at the tip of the tongue where the bitter taste buds do not reside...  The taste sweetens up considerably in the middle where the hidden malts play out like a well-meaning but unskilled understudy next to the superstar hops. This malty middle-point is Ruination's Eye of the Storm.  Once the beer makes its way to the back of the mouth, the brief moment of gustatory solace is quicky shattered as Ruination proceeds to execute an astringent ninja ass-kicking on your bitter taste buds. Even as you are swallowing, the bitter hops stick their hooks into every untainted crevice of your throat, leaving a hot, dry, perfumey legacy that works longer than any mouthwash could ever hope to.  After the Ruination's passing, you're left with a warm belly, a numbness on the tip of your tongue, a throatful of insane hop bitterness and a hyperventilation-style headrush from your body thinking you've tried to breathe the ethanol laced air of some alien planet.  M - Due to the anisthetic qualities of this beer, it's hard to judge the mouthfeel. It's definitely viscous and slippery in the mouth. At first it seemed a little bit too carbonated, but as I drank further, it seemed to mellow a touch. It does effervesce a bit too much in the mouth, and the swallow isn't exactly a water slide. I guess that's the price you pay when inventing a beer for the sole purpose of going over the top, and in turn ""ruining"" people's taste buds.  D - The only reason I gave the drinkability better than a 3.5 is because of the sensory rush and sense of urgency you get when drinking it. Ruination is genuinely delicious, but the IBUs are so cranked up that it ultimately becomes a test of fortitude -- almost a dare -- for you to continue on to the next sip. However, the raw bitterness left in your throat is so strong that much like an addict, you *need* to take that next sip to quell the demons that are despoiling your palette.  EPILOGUE: All I can do is shake my head in disbelief. This is one crazy ass beer. The smell is euphoric and sublime. The taste is demonic and deep as the Laurentian Abyss. Unfortunately, the bitterness is so over the top that it creates mouthfeel and drinkability detriments that would otherwise be near perfect.  I retired for the evening about 20 minutes after completing the 22 oz. bottle, and sitting in bed, I noticed that the feeling I had was strangely reminiscent of the Codeine buzz I got from the medication I took last time I was ill. This beer is no joke.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ski271,4.42,"Appearance: From a 22oz. bottle. Poured a very slightly hazy light amber with a small, slightly off-white, foamy head that slowly diminished to a film. Decent lacing.  Smell: Pine with some citrus backing up this hop-attack. Marvelously hoppy with a pleasant light caramel maltiness backing it up.  Taste: More hop-attack. Pine and citrus. Grapefruit, orange, a little pear. Hmm. Im getting a lot more hop bitterness than hop flavor here, and the malt is very faint. Long-lasting resiny finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium-full body, oily texture, low carbonation.  Drinkability: This is a great example of where balance is intentionally thrown off, yet done in a tasteful way. So many subtle flavors underneath the insanely hoppy dominance. Definitely not one for the macro-drinking pansy. This one is for the adventurous and the hop-head that is searching for that hops Vahalla.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,phishgator,4.37,"The up front hop bitterness is something to be hold. I poured this into a snifter. There was not as big a head as say their IPA, but the aroma was floral hop oils. The taste was a big smack in the face of bitterness followed by a smooth malt backbone and finished with a tingling hop presence. This a must try for any true hop head.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,SkeeterHawk,3.85,"Appearance: Poured a clear reddish yellow color with a quarter inch of tanish head made up of small bubbles. There was some pretty decent lacing after consuming the beer.  Aroma: Oily, citrusy hop aroma. There may be a tad of malt there, but it is nothing compared to the hop presence. I can pick out Oranges, Lemons, and Grapefruits specifically.  Taste: Boat loads of citrus! It is rich and oily, while being bittering. I compare it to drinking orange juice, because the entire profile is lodged on the hop side of the balance.  Opinion: Well, I am not a huge fan of hoppy beers, and this beer in particular I would be inclined to say that it was too one dimensional. Not that they didn't put enough dimensions of hops in there, but there is barely any malt to balance it all out. It is pretty good, but I personally prefer some others more...like their regular IPA for example.

Lots of piney hop taste here as well, plus some grapefruit. Mouthfeel is creamy with just a bit of oiliness from all the hops.  Overall Impression: Hop juice! Fantastic beer if you are a hop-head.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Brian700,4.03,This beer poured a clear orangish tea color with a nice white head that sat nice and tall. It looked great in my tasting glass. There was a good amount of lacing going on.  Its big head gave off quite the aroma. Very floral and citrusy. The hop presence slaps you right in the face.  The taste follows the nose. There is a major hop presence but is not overwhelming. I think this beer does a great job of getting all of that hop flavor to come through without being pungeant. There is also some nice maltiness in the middle.  The mouthfeel is good. I would say this is a medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,medic25,4.67,"Unfortunately this is one I have to pick up out of state, since Connecticut doesn't get Stone's beers. Pours an orange-amber color, with a nice white head. Odor is incredibly hoppy, with quite a bite. The taste is like no other beer I've tried. Ass-kicking amount of hops, without being too bitter and too hoppy. Hints of grapefruit/citrus, maybe some pine. The alcohol is very well hidden, and this beer drinks very easily for such a super-hopped flavor.

Taste is much more bitter than sweet, alchohol is present with a complex and very dry aftertaste. Pow.  This is a strong brew, read the lable carefully.

147,4083,quasimoto,4.1,"This poured an orangeish yellow, with a giant off-white head. It is big and frothyand laced beautifully down the glass. It has a strong aroma of well balanced spicy and floral hops. The taste of overpowering hops turns to sweet malts and some grains. This ends up with a strong but not harsh bitterness at the end. The mouthfeel is slick and full, but with all of the carbination in the beer the bubbles arent harsh on the palette. This beer is definitley high on the drinkability scale. It's delicious, strong, and an all around great I.P.A.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Bold and hopy upfront with grapefruit and pine in the finish. This one is highly carbonated, a bit oily and medium bodied.

147,4083,MrBen,3.53,"I've had IPAs before, but nothing like this. This brew is a one-way ticket to Hopsville. It rents the top level of the Hop Hotel, never checks out, and generally mistreats the housekeeping staff. You've just tuned in to the 24-hour Hop TV Network, broadcasting nothing but HOPS.  If carrot juice were transparent, it would be called Stone Ruination. Great color. Head was big and rocky, it held on to the bottom, and the lacing was quite decent.  Aroma was taken over by pink grapefruit zest, and the smell of bitterness and acidity rang out as well. As far as taste, well, extreme on the citrus. There were some malty notes in there, as well as some accompanying sweetness (thank goodness), but I swore I could see big, hoppy, bootprints on the drowning malt's shoulders.  Stone Ruination is quality beer. It's more than a few steps over the line as far as acidity and bitterness go, but these characteristics don't totally detract from the refreshing nature of the brew. IPA is a style I don't visit often. There are too many others I prefer, plus it's only fair to let you guys have your share.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

This is a very drinkable ale, I will definitely be buying more.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,lostbearbrew,4,"I have now had many Double IPA's and have to say my first impressions of Ruination have changed. While still thinking this is a nice beer, it is not the archtypal beer of its style, not even close, imho.  Appearance: Nice light orange color with a white head - very light lacing down the glass.  How's it smell? Very piney up front, with some other hops, more earthy, perhaps underlying. A small hint of malt or caramel, but not noticeable at first.  Very much of a hops assault on your tastebuds, but in a good way. Smiles! Lacks the balance of some of the other top rated IPA's, but find this still be quite drinkable, but not as much as I did originally.  Not sure why, but this beer often seems to be slightly overcarbonated to me. Actually, almost each time I've had it now - 12 22 oz worth.  I found this to be an enjoyable, strong, agressively hoppy beer which lives up to its claim of ruining your palate for a little while. However, it does not find the balance many other DIPA's seem to have cradled themselves into, and is no longer one of my personal top 10.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Quaffer,4.02,"22 oz. bottle. Not available here in Wichita. Thanks, Bruiser81!  Appearance: This beer was lightly hazy with a bright, golden-orange appearance. The off-white head rose up to a perfect two fingers and settled down very slowly, leaving a lot of itself behind stuck to the side of the glass. Tons of lacing.  Smell: A nice and juicy, citrus hops aroma was the most obvious smell on the nose. Orange and grapefruit mingled well with sweet and roasted malts. A little bit of bread and vanilla lurked about as well. Pretty straightforward, but very nice and exactly what I would expect from this style.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and smooth. It was buttery, but still had a firmness to it.  Taste: The hops jumped right out and dominated the flavor of this beer from start to finish. They had both a citrus and an herbal quality to them, with the herbal portion becoming the strongent on the finish and in the aftertaste. Sweet malts existed underneath, but they did little more than attempt to balance out this brew. The light alcohol flavor and the herbalness of the hops gave the aftertaste a medicinal quality.  I would have to say that it is not exactly what I would call balanced. But I'm a hop head , so screw it . . . it's great.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,froggyfrog,4.15,"Purchased in 22 oz. screen-printed bottle. Served in standard pint glass.  Ruination arrives in the glass a transparent if somewhat murky light copper in color, like liquid pennies. Sitting on top is a big fluffy white head with tons of chunky lacing sticking to the glass. Carbonation level is just right, bringing the bubbles just where and when they are needed.  The nose is all citrus and evergreen. Scents of orange, lemon and pine tree sap abound.  Smooth and snappy on the tongue, Ruination carries its 100+ IBUs right to the back the mouth where all of that hop resin sits quite nicely.  The taste brings a mild dry pear texture at first with something I cant quite place in the middle, almost an earthy maple-vanilla quality. Its the malt. Thats what it is. Its sweet. Perfectly smooth-sweet barley malt in the middle with a flagrant grapefruit assault in the finish.  Talk about balance. This is a super hoppy beer but it is not harsh in the least. This beer is an exciting seesaw ride with malted grain on one side and crazy hops on the other. It is safe to believe the hype on this beer.

147,4083,cooter,3.95,"1pint, 6fl oz. bottle served in Duvel glass and a pint glass (for different perspectives). WONDROUS lacing in the Duvel. Flabbergasting. I read the boastful essay on the bottle before reviewing.  Smells clean, hoppy, grapefruity, sticky, and piney. Ridiculously obscure fruity esthers abound--pear? Raspberry? Can't tell, it's just an undercurrent for now. But it's a smooth pre-tasting smell.  BIIITTTERRRR jesus christ it's bitter. Smooth in front and a crisp yet grainy (somehow in a good way) aftertaste, but bitter bitter bitter. Tastes like sour grapefruit, half-rotten grapefruit, grapefruit rinds. The juice from a sack of pine needles, mashed. Head is now dissipated from 1.5 inches to a thick film in each glass, with large bubbles in large groups. I swear i just coughed because it was so bitter. (drinkability score follows style standards, i guess)  A long drink gives me strange other flavors, like apple? Orange? Every drink kicks me in the balls. Twice. I will now describe this beer drunkenly in one word: EXHILIRATING. It's like skydiving in hops.  Every couple swallows, now, I get really farkin drunk, but also I get an amazing hint--no, jawbreaking slap--of an out-of-place but excellent taste. I think one was just milky, or ultra-strawberry, or something. It's good, anyhow.  This certainly is hop-to-the-Nth-degree. I like it because it seems to be the top of its class without losing its class, if you follow. But it's...not a chore, but a task to finish. It requires effort to drink, but you're rewarded with simply astounding hops and flavor.

The aroma is flowery, grassy hops with some citrus, pepper, banana, cloves and a little toasted malt.  The flavor is citrus and pepper followed quickly by a big floral hop bitterness that lingers long and strong in the sticky aftertaste. It's medium bodied and kind of light on the carbonation.  A good DIPA, but pretty one-dimensional. It has some of the most extreme hop bitterness I've had in a beer. It tames some as it warms.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,pjwilson,2.56,"not really feeling this one. this beer is so out of balance it's rediculous. Every sip is painful with bitterness. I would consider myself a hophead but this just doesn't seem to work to me. This is liquid hop juice. If that's your thing, cool; i'd perfer to drink beer. I'm kind of suprised this is avaliable year round when double bastard and the stout come out in limited qualities, both miles beter than this. Appearance: looks like thier regular ipa. can't really knock that smell: it's unique, i'll give you that. strange mix of rubbing alcohol and weird hoppiness. different but not all that pleasant. taste: bitter. very bitter, can't real enjoy the hops. It's not about IBU's people, it's about high IBU's with balance. i like me some hop flavor with the bitterness, the regular Stone Ipa is very good in this resepct. no tasty hop flavor here. This beer is only 7.7 which is the lowest ""double"" i've seen. Needs more malts. There is a slight sweetness in the backround, but it doesn't mesh at all with the hops. for this many hops this beer ""should"" be 10 percent. mouthfeel: too damn thin. drinkability: it takes one bad beer for me to drain pour. I'll finish this but never again will i get this.  Notes: I'm going against the grain on this one since the score is 91 as of this writing but i have to ask, what are people smoking? this tastes like crap( it's hurts you stomach too) I'm not impressed and this is the worst stone offering ever. I'm sure everyone will want to try it once. Spend you r time and money trying to get some Pliny the Elder if you want to taste a hophead beer done right.

147,4083,mushroomcloud,4.22,"Ruination is a deep copper hue. The liquid is bright annd clear. A 1"" off-white head tops this beer off. The head fell to 1/4"" and had good retention. Good lacing.  Tangy hops. Citrus, pine (Pine-Sol cleaner? But in a good way.) The citrus smell is like a tangerine or an orange peel. There is a candied sweet smell in there also.  Spruce, grapefruit, sour orange. Alcohol. This beer has a good deal of bitterness but it is not over the top. I expected it to be screaming. There is definite malt presence underneath the big hops. The bitterness is reminiscent of biting an orange peel. Very unexpectedly balanced DIPA.  Ruination has good carbonation. The beer coats the mouth with a full body that is rich and far from thin or watery. A nice bitter bite that vanishes all of a sudden and then reappears out of nowhere for another round.  The drinkability on this Stone DIPA is high, it is about as drinkable as Stone IPA. The beer was so remarkably drinkable and balanced that I am wondering if it already had some age on it when I bought it. This is the first bomber of Ruination I have had so I am not sure what to compare it to.

Smell does have a fair amount of hop aroma in it, but it seems like there could be even moreso. This does have a nice sweet presence that is missing from way too many big beers these days, which helps to accompany the larger hop profile. This did fulfill my hop fix, but it could've been more over the top, which I almost expect from the style. Or have I become tollerant of high hopiness?

Cloudy amber in color with a creamy head which was moderately strong but gave in eventually.  The aroma was hoppy and light, sweet, with some orange notes.  The flavor was very hoppy, in an earthy/herbal way, tasty and tangy. It has a creamy mouthfeel. The bitterness shows up later, and grows - at first I would have guessed this beer was not bitter at all, but by the time I finished it, I was really getting into most of the ""200"" IBUs (though, I'm not sure the last 100 really made it onto my palette). The finish was floral and bitter, a bit smoky.  Overall, this was a good, creamy, colorful beer. ""Luscious,"" said Grover - and I agree.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Crushing, oily hop juice with some carbonic bite in the middle. Long bitter finish with a medium to full mouthfeel. Unfortunately, for me, unless you are just a serious hop-maniac, a pint is more than enough for this brew. Maybe it is the ad copy on the bottle, but I can't really taste anything else but hops, even now. I guess it's unfair to say this beer has a ""finish"" at all. Maybe after a garlic clove and some Scope.

147,4083,Sephiroth,4.37,"I remember how I puckered the first time I sampled this. Now, I kneel at the altar of the hop. Poured into a tulip, the beer is a clear, light golden color. There is an inch of head.  The nose is floral, and infused with a dry, citrus aroma. The taste is, ""a liquid poem to the glory of the hop, "" as the bottle says. There is just enough malt to prevent this from being unbalanced in a bad way. As it is, this is unbalanced in a good way. The hops are a rainbow of citrus flavors, and they do run the entire gamut. Bitter oranges and lemons, grapefruits, and then, a slight pineyness at the end. The mouthfeel is light for the style, but it does coat one's throat. I must give this a lower drinkability than I would normally give the style because of the extreme hops. Do not drink this if are prone to heartburn, or face the consequences. I am not afraid.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Shultzerdugen,4,"22 oz. brown bottle.  White head on a clear amber fluid.  Alcohol right up front in the nose, underscored by piney hops and a sweet toffee like malt tinge.  Medium body with ample carbonation for the ABV. Alcohol is a bit out of proportion--even compared to the massive hops. Great herbal/citrus hop with matching burps. Booze is spicy and burning in the finish.  I hate to say it, but the booze was really out of control for me in this beer. Still pretty good, but the least best I've had from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,palliko,4.2,"Appearance is hazy amber with some white foam, but little lacing. Aroma is (as a Stone beer should) mostly hops. Grapefruity, leafy, aromatic, floral hops. Initial taste is sweet malt, surprisingly, but the hops are there! Sourdough bread, toasty crackers, and creamy smooth. The taste mellows in the mouth down to some nice fruity flavors, drying nicely to a smoth finish with some yeast bread. This is a good IPA  and lots of alcohol!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BEERchitect,4.5,"Browsing the beer aisle today and it dawned on me that I hadn't had this beer in a while. Good choice Kevin, good choice!  The beer opens with a coppery-orangy tint, obvious haze from dry hopping and froathy head formation. The head laced well but I expected more. Lots of lacing left behind.  Sharp, spicy, citrusy, piney, and acidic hop aromas assault the olfactories and promise a hop-forward beer. Only a timid caramel malt character wants to compete. No esters, no phenolics- a pretty clean aroma.  Hop flavor makes the hop aroma look pansical. Juicy hop flavors of grapefruit, orange zest, grapefruit, piney-grassy, grapefruit, and lemon-grass, and, ...oh yea, grapefruit! The clean malt character that I found in the nose falls by the waistside in flavor- this one is all about the hops.  As expected, a clean hop bitterness dominates with a malt roundess that offers little sweetness on the palate and even less balance. Cracker-like in the body, then caramelized malts don't stand a chance. A piney, grapefruit aftertaste persists as the beer dries out wonderfully in the end.  Has a truer American IPA ever been brewed?",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,LPorter33,4.4,"Purchased 22oz bomber from Martignetti's  Appearance = Semi-transparent golden honey colored hue. Very nice lacing and adequate head retention.  Smell = Raw oily hoppiness with the typical powerful citrus blast coming through. Smells like a very well crafted double IPA.  Taste = Excellent. Wonderful balance. The hops are there and fierce but the sweetness comes in perfectly to tone it down a bit so it doesn't overwhelm the palate. A very spicy, peppery taste is mixed in which adds additional kick. Great aftertaste that leave the mouth craving the next sip.  Overall = Right up there with Dogfish Head 90 and Hercules as my favorite Double IPAs. Highly recommended to fans of this style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Aroma - highly aromatic with orange and pineapple, good persistence as well.  Taste - sweet citrusy flavor atop a decent malt and light alcohol base. Strong bitterness ensues, like concentrated grapefruit rind oil. The swallow is a clarifying of the hop profile on the palate. Very bitter as alcohol warms the finish, truly a hop head's dream come true.  Mouthfeel - thick, average carbonation, resinous and coating.  Drinkability - a great balance of big beer alcohol, hops, and malt that make this beer this good this long after purchase.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ILiveOffHops,4.35,"One of Stone's best as far as I'm concerned.  The Ruination is a golden orange with thick and chunky head that sticks to the glass. A nice amount of CO2 bubbling up from the bottom. It smells of potent hops, citrus, and sweet smelling flowers. Tastes just beautiful...intense hops!!! Almost like chewing on a fresh hop (which if you've never done I recommend trying) Slick, sweet citrus...orange peel maybe. I think the mouthfeel is perfect...not as dry as some double IPAs. I give this a thumbs up for drinkability. Not weak, which keeps it from getting a rating of 5 on drinkability. But other than that it is just great to drink. Cheers to Stone for a great double IPA!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,kaszeta,4.49,"Sampled at the 2005 American Beer Fest in Boston.  I love IPAs and Double IPAs, but, like the late 90s chardonnay craze in which virtually every winery started over-oaking their wines, so many breweries have gotten carried away with the whole IPA thing: let's just dump a shitload of hops in our ale and make an IPA... And double IPAs are usually even worse...  But Stone has done a good job with this one. The beer has a nice dark red body with a thin lacy head. The aroma is what wins me over on this one---it's not just a menthol-ish overhopped aroma, it's a nice well-rounded floral hops aroma, with some light orange/citrus notes. It just smells crisp. Taste matches the smell very nicely: sharp bite of hops on the front, some nice mellow malt rounded out with a citrus tang, leaving a more mellow hops note on the finish. Mouthfeel is very pleasant, this just dances around on the tongue with a bit of zing.  I wouldn't get carried away with this, it's definitely not a session beer, but it's a very well done IPA, and one of my favorites. Stone comes through again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,HopHeadKen,4.7,The sweet barley is only a vehicle to deliver addictive quantities of hops. So you had better be a hop lover when you try this beer.  Pours orange copper clear with creamy ivory head.  I am suprized that I can even detect the sweetness of the malt over the obvious bushel of hops per bottle.  Nice mouthfeel. I had hop flavor hanging on 30 minute later.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Buildscharacter,4.07,"What can you say about Stone that's not already been said?  This DIPA is a great example of the breed. It opens up with a beautiful floral hop aroma that is sweet and begs you to take a sip. It's in typical Stone fashion to really overload..well put quite a bit of hops in there. I wouldn't say that it's overdone, especially for an DIPA.  The brew is smooth going down and leaves a warm feeling in the gullet. There is a sort of vegetative flavor in there. Reminds me of Gin? Don't know why, but it does. I suppose there's some sort of fruit flavor in there that's I'm missing.  Either way, this bottle if quite a good one. I'm a big fan of the regular IPA but I would have to say that I prefer this excellent brew from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Dithyramb,4.5,"Bottle purchased from Midtown in Nashville and enjoyed as a night cap last night. Poured super clear golden orange. Big, frothy, tight bubbled head with excellent retention and textbook perfect lacing. Smell of citrus laden hoppiness with orange peel and grapefruit rind. Biting, shockingly bitter hop residue assaults your tongue. Man, this one is bitter. Chewy mouthfeel that was light medium. I didn't really detect the alcohol previously mentioned. Finished juicy on the mouth but slightly astringent if you wait too long to have another. Surprisingly drinkable. Where did the bottle go?",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,DogFood11,4.55,Stone beers are starting to dominate the space in my beer fridge. This one did not dissapoint and will have to be added to the stable  The smell is ultra hoppy and the taste does not dissapoint. For some there may be too much of an alcohol finish but for me the slight twinge of some alcohol was a nice fit. This seems like it would be a nice nightcapper type of beer.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Viggo,4.59,"Pours a clear golden amber, nice tight head forms. Smell is unmistakenly hops, as soon as the bottle is cracked pine fills the room, very spicy and my nose is ruined now. Taste: I don't know, my taste buds won't function after the first drink of insane hoppiness, seriously. Slight alcohol burn/warming, but pleasant. My taste buds feel numb, insanely hoppy with a very thick and chewy backbone, this is one kickass beer, I could drink this all day every day. Thanks for the import DrJay.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,scooter231,4.38,"I was pretty shocked by this one. With a name like Ruination IPA (and coming from Stone, at that) I was expecting a love it or hate it kind of thing, except if you loved it, it'd be more like... tolerating it. And yet, I loved it.  It's a gorgeous red-golden color, with not much head that disappates pretty quickly- but very appealing looking. The smell? Hoppy hoppy hoppy, so hoppy, with some citrus notes. Taste is exactly how it smells- hoppy, with citrus and lemon flavors, a bit of an earthy taste. Mouthfeel plays on the tongue- bubbly, tart feeling, tasty.  I can see the hoppyness getting to you after a while, but this was a pretty darn drinkable beer- besides being tasty, I couldn't sense any alcohol in it at all- a great find.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,MaltyGoodness,3.43,"Beautiful 22oz. bottle. These guys know how to make a bottle!  Pours a clear yellow/orange, with a creamy white head. Beautiful lacing on the glass.  Smells like hops, and plenty of em. I could sit and smell this sucker all night.  Tastes like hops, and plenty of em. Bottle says 100+ IBU and it's no lie. Hops up front, in the middle, and kicks you in the ass on the way out. Could use a hint of malt somewhere in the mix, a litte too unbalanced for my liking.  Body is good, about perfect for the style.  I can drink one of these from time to time.

It's totally rewarding.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Obviously grapefruit, pine, balsamic. The taste: slightly bitter ;-) A lot of hop; 100 IBU, well it could be. A good malty background, to support all. Maybe the hops is too aggressive? I don't know, but the taste seems more balanced than the smell. Obviously, on the bitter side. After all, good, toady. Medium body. Bitter in the aftertaste. Yes, but after that?

147,4083,jakester,4.45,"This was a 22oz bomber bought at Union Jack's on the Manatawny. Bottle is beautiful, embossed, stunning. No date, however. It pours a clear deep, golden color with a slightly off-white, creamy head, @1/2 inch. Slight carbonation is evident. Head stays @1/8 inch throughout. Not much lacing on the glass.  The aroma is grassy/fruity hops up front. Maybe pineapple.Slight bready malt way in the back. Alcohol is present as the beer warms.  This beer tastes like it smells. Grassy citrusy. Not overly bitter. In fact, this is very well balanced for a DIPA. Malt sweetness is present, but not overdone. Alcohol warmth finishes the flavor.  Wonderful hop oils coat the tongue and mouth, even after swallowing. Soft carbonation almost reminds you of cask ale. Sweetness and bitterness seem perfectly balanced. A long, lingering hop and heat finish.  The guy that designed this beer had drinkability in mind. This is so well done, it's hard to criticize anything.

147,4083,blitz134,4.52,"Immediately upon cracking the top hoppy aroma fills the air around me. This could get interesting...  Appearance: Transparent light caramel color with a one finger white head that reduced to a somewhat lumpy layer with scattered large bubbles.  Smell: Dominating citrus hops...orange and grapefruit mostly. A good floral hit as well. Sweet overall though, I even detect some cotton candy in there.  Taste: Taste is somewhat different that the aroma. This is a pretty bitter brew that offers itself with biting pine and straw flavored hops. Not really much citrus in the taste as would have been expected with the aroma on this. Bitterness hits fairly hard. This is just a very agreeable taste. There really isn't any portion of it that one could complain about. The hoppy burps that follow are pretty tasty as well, containing mostly pine resin flavors (haha...beer review...not a burp review...back to business...)  Mouthfeel: A good solid feel on this one, relatively full bodied with a slight bit of oilyness. This one coats well and lingers for a good while.  Drinkability: The flavor profile and relatively light ABV percentage for the style factor well here and make this extremely drinkable. The mouthfeel and very inviting aroma make you want to keep coming back for this. Could be one of the most drinkable DIPAs I've run across and I feel really garners a '5' in this category.  Amazing beer...'nough said...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,garymuchow,4.29,"Thanks to both WVbeergeek and Gueuzedude for samples of this fine elixar.  Aroma is wonderfully full of hops with grassiness and a slightly sweet malt backing. There is a creamy quality to the aroma that isn't quite diacytel but there nonetheless and it is pleasing. Gold yellow and clear. Head leaves early, but starts heavy and full. Looks lighter than it is. Flavor has great balance between the hops intensity and the malty fullness. Constant movement of flavors. I like the softness of the malt and the grassy intensity of the hops with the strong enough bitterness. Thick and almost chewy. Not quite syrupy. Nice fluffiness and softness from the carbonation. Well done. Highly drinkable, although too much hops tends to make me not feel too well in the long run ( a weird hang-over kind of thing), so that takes away some in that it limits the amount of the hop monsters I can drink in one sitting.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Litterbean,3.75,"Pours a golden orange, with a thin head that leaves a bit of lace. Slightly hazy but bright and vibrant.  Smells primarily of hops. Hints of mint leaves, orange, and assorted other fruits and spices. A sort of sweet and spicy smell is also in there.  I expected this to taste a bit more hoppy. It's very sweet, and I feel that Stone's regular IPA is more palatable. Still, it's a good taste. Some sweet candy like flavors with a real biting chewy hoppiness. The mouthfeel is smooth, but the hoppiness is a bit oily and chewy. Still, refreshing as hell on a hot night.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Transparent golden beer with a few streams of tiny bubbles rising from around the bottom edge. Sugary tea and chewy grapefruit sit on a solid malt base. Alcohol and a fairly strong bitterness kick in towards the end. Bitterness lingers for days, but isn't overwhelming. Body isn't too heavy, just a pinch chewy. A solid IIPA that's makes a good representative for the style.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

This beauty is strikingly crystal clear, with a warm ruby-amber hue underneath a tight 1/2"" head of winter white foam.  The nose is wonderful - rich, citrused, hops, creamy.  Initial taste is (surprise) hops, sharp at that. There's a mild malted quality that blends with the hops, then surrenders to a different hop experience on the throat. There is a brassiness to this that is not pleasing, nor is the bitter aftertaste.  I have limited experience with double IPA's, and found this one very harsh. Stoudt's double is, IMHO, much better.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,klewis,3.39,"Serving: 22 oz. bottle  Appearance: Dark golden, huge fluffy head, lots of lacing. Nice.  Smell: Strong alcohol that almost stings the nose, lots of hops, and maybe a touch of citrus  Taste: Hops, hops, hops, hops, and hops. The intensity is mild at first and increases long after you've swallowed. Definitely ""over-hopped"" as advertised on the bottle.  Mouthfeel: Tingly and medium-bodied, a quality I like with the style, but perhaps a bit too carbonated.  Drinkability: The extreme bitterness and high ABV would make it difficult for me to drink more than one.  Perhaps I should have heeded the warning on the label and should not have attempted this beer yet, as I can't consider myself a ""confirmed hop head"". Granted, this is definitely a respectable brew, as expected, but in my short time as a serious BA, there have been other IPA's that I would rather drink before purchasing this one again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,TongoRad,4.29,"Pours a beautiful, though very slightly hazy, saturated amber with a solid two finger head.  Aroma is powerful, though not overbearing. Piney/resiny hops are dominant, yet there is also a good helping of pineapple, tropical fruit and caramel. A good dose of alcohol lies underneath it all.  Flavor and mouthfeel are rich and luscious. There is also a serious amount of bitterness cutting through it all. The same resiny/fruity caramel characteristics follow through on the palate. Bitterness and alcohol linger, and those hops won't let go.  By the end of a bomber this beer can get to be a bit much, but it is obviously well made.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Tasted of full on hops, to the point of them being over bearing. Leaves your mouth numb after a while. If you're looking for a well balanced IPA this is not it. Very bitter and dry finish with alcohol overtones. Smallest amount of malt in the background  Mouthfeel was good with carbonation maybe slightly high, but OK all in all.  Drinkibility was was not great due to the hop overkill that renders your tastebuds useless.  Overall this is a beer made to be extreme and nothing else. It succedes in that sense, but it is devoid of any type of balance to it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,weeare138,3.2,"This one has been aging in the cellar since '03... Appears a nice transparent orange with a 1 finger foamy white head. Smell is of a citrusy, resinous hop with a bit of a biscuit, or oyster cracker smell backing it up. Oh boy...I can smell the alcohol on this one too. Taste is overkill of bitter hops. Lots of floral, citrus hops and wood undertones with the bitterness killing every last tastebud. Don't know if it's me or what but this is like drinking malt licquor. So far, not so good. Mouthfeel is ok but again, there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of balance to all the bitterness that's going on. The alcohol is listed at 7.7%. Seems much more apparent and higher. Drinkability was very dissapointing considering the amount of time that I was hyped up while cellar aging. Don't know if I let this go too long but I love well balanced IPA's and IIPA's. To me, this was hardly drinkable. It was like trying to drink a cognac that wasn't smooth, or balanced. Maybe I'll give one another try but I'll be cautious. I've loved several other IIPA's, including ones with IBU's over 90. Maybe next time.  It's ok, dog.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The head is fiesty and rises fast, yellowish/orange-tinged head, dense and full-figured, long-lasting retention; leaves a nice sheet of lace on the glass. Smell: Grapefruit, lemons; grapefruit, grapefruit! And a subtle undertone of caramel. Taste: Sharp, very sharp blast of hop bitterness like a citrus-razor across the tip of my palate; the middle tugs out some malt background, subtle, like a pinch of cotton candy, but damn those hops zip back into the foreground with the quickness; this brew is like a hop headlock. Aftertaste: An incredibly long echo of hop zip and sting. Mouthfeel: Slick, fairly well carbonated. This is a beer brewed for hopheads. A beast.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

There is also a nice malt profile in the nose, more than I would say is characteristic of other DIPAs, and also an estery, yeasty sweetness. Initially tastes of primarily grapefuit hops, with more of a piney note in the finish, and a very evident, almost biscuity malt presence that balances the hops very nicely. As in the aroma, there is also a yeasty element in the flavor that hits just before the lingering bitter and slightly alcoholic finsh. Coats the mouth nicely, little carbonation.

THe head sticks to the glass well leaving leveled lacing.  Smell: Caramel and earthy hop flavor. Very sweet nose.  Taste: Caramel, citrus, earthy hop bitterness and a sweetness that makes it somewhat reminiscent of an American Barley Wine. Dry, toasty with a nice malty ending. In the middle there is a surge of alcohol flavor that I did not particularly enjoy. There's an overall earthiness to this beer with dry leaves, pine, and bark.  Mouthfeel: Sticky sweet, smooth and sandy in nature.  Drinkability: The bold hoppines makes it a bit uncomfortable but it is still a well balanced and well hopped beer. The light fruitiness and caramel character make it enjoyable, but it's not great in my book.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,FLAbeergutinMASS,4.54,"I truly believe that regional beer (freshness first and foremost) hold the best qualities of the beer; not having to deal with a cross-country journey, questions as to the variations in stored temperatures, the price, any number of factors that we've all encountered. So I am always a bit skeptical when buying a west coast beer.  A decent looking IPA, as I am drinking it I cannot get away from Stone being the Sam Adams of the other side of the country. Relatively uninspired, nice, but nothing great, weak head retention.  By far the best aspect of this beer is its smell. Screaming citrus (peach and lemon), just smells really nice. Nice job of meshing the alcohol with many estery qualities.  I am not a big hops guy but this is good. I knew what I was getting myself into and I must say they've done an excellent job. Again, the brewery has done a great job meshing the characteristics of the beer.  Beer presents itself as a relatively light IPA, almost an APA, minus the hops.

Oranges, lemons, Somehow there's a good amount of malt aroma that makes its way out of the glass as well.  Taste/mouthfeel: This one is up there on the bitterness charts. This and the Smuttynose IPA are the most bitter I've tasted. Luckily there's a lot else that's able to go on inside the mouth. The hop bombs really go off in the flavoring too, wow. The beer really coats the mouth, sweet and slick.  Drinkability: For such and intense beer, the drinkability is reasonble.

Maybe i'm just lushing over sprintime here, but, this beer is going all over the place. oh yeah, and there are hops in there, too. In fact, I think that's the predominant flavour in this beer, the hops.  Mouthfeel, good, yup. all very medium-thick and satisfying, while still being drinkable. Very drinkable indeed.

147,4083,RedwoodGeorge,3.5,"The beer pours a bright straw yellow with a surprisingly thin head which quickly dies to a white ring around the top of the brew. Moderate amounts of lacing is left on the glass as you progress through the drink.  The smell has slight sweet notes of caramel with pronounced piney and floral hop notes. Taste follows suit with a minimal malt presence and a very floral, lavender like hop bite. The malt is quite thin with only hints of bread or grain while the hops has a somewhat bitter, acrid aftertaste. There's no hint of alcohol sweetness or burn to detract from the taste.  Carbonation is wonderful - whatever's missing from the head is present in the body of the brew as very fine, sharp bubbles that do a good job of clearing the palate after each sip.  Frankly, I'm not that excited by Stone's choices of hops for their IPAs. Maybe I'm biased toward the Pacific Northwest ""Four C's"" hops styles and expect more of that sort of taste from a California IPA - that's not to be found here. Stone's hops are more floral, acidic and bitter without much of the richness you'd normally find in a West Coast brew.

Sweet estery hops aroma in the nose.  The taste is like marmelade on toast (candyish orange and toasty malt). Heavy bodied, lots of carbonation, but an ale this heavy needs it. Almost puckering at the finish. This is one beefy IPA! I guess that's only reinforced by the fact that I've got a nice big bomber of it. This is fairly drinkable of you're feeling like a tough guy.

As you open the bomber style bottle a blast of hop aroma fills the air with a floral preview. You pour this amber orange good looking brew with its slight haze and off white head. Lace is fair while spotted, but sticks. Retention and carbonation hold up well. The aroma blends a bunch of treats such as citric fruits, evergreen pine and hops. The taste starts out as a sweet malt, curves to tropical fruits, citric and orange peel. Then a wooded evergreen pine and grass. Then a faint alcohol feel is noticed and a slight oil coats the mouth. The mouthfeel carries from the taste as a hop dryness settles on the mouth and lingers awhile. I mean it lingers on a long while as your taste buds are in tune with this IPA long after you drink it down. I did it like this, as a project beer. For as you take a drink, it stays with you for so long, you can really get some things done inbetween sips. A truely delicious workhorse of a beer!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Vol. Note on the front of the bottleA liquid poem to the glory of the hop!  Appearance  golden orange body with no visible carbonation after the attractive rush of carbonation at pour; 2.5 finger, creamy white head to start and it runs with good retention, lace is less than other Stones but it holds its own  Smell  Bob Beamon-level hop in the nose; some malts; faint alcohol; considering the hopcentric aim, this is a bullseye  Taste  pine, grapefruit rind hop; bit of spice; hop has Tyson-like toughness to close; some pleasant and smoother malts enter midway for a temporary balance and they run for a second into the aftertaste and disappear; the hops are a brute  Mouthfeel  great feel from start to close; hop sting and gentle carbonation are great plusses; closer to full from start to finish (but Id tab it moderate body) and drier at the close than most IPAs; clean palate at close  Drinkability  massive hops in the transition phase add intrigue for the hophead but could cause some to hesitate  You better hit Ruination back or you are down in the first round.

147,4083,Hefe,4.44,"Poured from a 22oz. brown bomber. 3/25/05 - A Liquid poem to the glory of the Hop.  Pours lightly hazy orange/gold with a thick off-white head that last and lasts. The aromas are pungent; citrus, pine, apricot, grass, toast. Surprisingly big malt right away, with the hop character of the beer asserting itself but not overwhelming. Comlpex profile of flavors, peaches/apricots, candied citrus, yeast, mango, piney-floral hops, bread. A Creamy and slightly oily mouthfeel helps this beer go down smooth despite the ABV and the big hop punch.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,baiser,4.32,"Pours a hazy, golden orange body with a fluffy white head and good lacing. Quite pale, with a bit of cloudiness, like peache juice. Intense aroma of citrus, hops and a tremendous earthiness. More intense than their IPA, but still extremely drinkable. After taste is bitter, with a dry, puckering bite. One of the best west coast IPAs I""ve had the pleasure of tasting. A bit over the top, since I'd prefer their IPA, but this Ruination is extremely tastey.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,oxmasterscream,4,"Nice hazy, golden-orange in color. Thin but creamy looking head. Huge aromas of pine sap couple with some background citrus happenings. After a while, the malt gave off aromas of orange blossom honey and apricot. Taste was a nice balance of sweet honey combined with a bitter, piney presence that leads into the expected mouth crushing bitterness of a Stone brew. Allowing it to warm a bit brings out its best. Mouth was thick and full, a little silky and very tingly on the tongue. Good stuff, 'specially for the hop head.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,donnebaby,3.63,"Way high up sticky and thin filmy head. Body is a shining, clear amber golden bronze color.  Nose is bitter and grassy, a potent hop cocktail. Sweet apples.  Taste is light tropical fruits, mango. Hops lightly scorch the tongue and throat. Smooth and fruity, but I was put away by the massive booze feel and overall dryness. Drinkability is quite bad. Hop vines grew out of my throat and strangled me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

A moderate roasted nutty caramel malt aroma with lots of hops, herbal pine and lime hops, also has hints of toffee and licorice.  The taste is a sweet and bitter roasted nutty caramel malt; huge herbal pine and grapefruit lime hops; and honey, vanilla, and licorice in the background.  A medium to full body, dry almost syrupy texture, soft carbonation, and a smooth finish.  A very smooth hoppy beer in the session mold with 7.7 ... bow down.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,dgallina,4.05,"Pours a clear orange-amber with a generous off-white head that leaves a medium-sized blanket of foam and light lace. Smells of resin-like piney hops with a citrus edge. Flavor is aggressively hoppy; mostly piney hop and citrus tastes. Nice long-lasting bitter and dry finish. Creamy and smooth in the mouth, with subdued, but long-lasting carbonation. Easy-drinking and flavorful, but a bit less balanced and interesting that the regular Stone IPA in my opinion.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mynie,4.5,"Smells like hops. Harsh, complex and floral, with just a hint of malt coming in. Very, very nice.  Very hoppy, of course. The hops are strong and bitter and floral and they hit you hard, but they are backed up a sensational dark malt that comes in quickly to put out the fire. Wonderful, really, and it leaves a taste of toffee in your mouth that dissolves into bitterness&#8212;the most complicated aftertaste ever.  Wonderful beer, really. Not much more I can say.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,hobbes2112,4.15,"22 oz bomber.  My last beer from my trip to the Buffalo area. This one pours a golden orange with a three finger thick, small bubble head. Short retention with lots of lacing. Smell is huge hops, grapefruit and pine don't even begin to describe the full hop presence. Taste is very surprising, from the aroma I assumed this would just be a hop bomb. At the start though there is a definate malt layer. Soon after though the hops show up, and in force! What a punch too, the middle to end to finish are all hop dominated.  I am glad I took heed of the bottle's warning and saved this one for last. This does indeed ruin the palate. It is worth it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,palma,4.08,"Yeah! 22 oz bomber. Clear orange body with a smooth off white head. Aroma is very fruity, mostly citrus. Big fruit flavor up front. Then all hell breaks loose with the piney hops attacking your palate. You can find a sweet citrus, and dare I say it, even a malty backbone hiding among the hops. A tart and bitter citrus aftertaste, like lemon or orange peel. Flavor is very similar to Stone's regular IPA - maybe slightly more bitter but definitely with more alcohol in the taste. This beer is not for the newbee or the faint of heart. When they say 100 IBU's, they mean it. This beer will bitch slap you if you're a pussy!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jed,4.03,"Presentation: Brown, 22 oz bomber with the Stone gargoyle and ""A liquid poem to the glory of the hops!"" on the front. As expected, a hilarious blurb bragging about this beer's ""ruinous effect on your palate"" on the back of the bottle. No freshness date, but the bottle had been sitting in my fridge for about six months. Poured into an imperial pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a hazy, honey orange color with a huge, two finger head. Excellent head retention. As head dissipates, it leaves behind a thick layer of lacing that uniformly coats the sides of the glass.  Smell: Sweet, sticky hop aromas dominate the smell. Citrus helps hide the hints of raw alcohol esters  this beer clearly packs a punch.  Taste: A hint of sweetness and then an overwhelming wave of spicy hops. Because this beer has been aged a bit, not instant ruination, but waves of dry bitterness. This is proudly a one note beer, just hops, hops, hops with the slighest hint of sweet fruits. Finish is dry, with lingering citrus bitterness.  Mouthfeel: For such a feared beer, this is surprisingly smooth and not too acidic. Carbonation is restrained.  Drinkability: Again, I realize I'm not getting the full effect of a fresh beer, but if you like hops, this seems pretty drinkable. The 7.7% alcohol and the high hop content would make for a miserable hangover, so this is strictly a one bottle beer.  Not quite the fearsome, palette-destroying beer I'd anticipated. I'd like to get my hands on a fresher bottle, but as it stands, a delicious double IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Gagnonsux,4.37,"I picked this up in Memphis, TN while on vacation, I wish it were available in Houston. The color is golden copper with a tall, sticky head which leaves nice lacings around the inside of my pint glass. Aroma is strongly and solely of citrusy hops, of course this was expected. Taste is a full-on barrage of citrusy west coast hops. There is plenty of bitterness and flavor to go around. Drinkability is a little bit low for such an enjoyable brew due to the over-the-top hoppiness. This is the kind of beer that wrecks your palate for the evening too. This is my second beer from Stone, after their Arrogant Bastard, and all I can say is that they are fastly becoming one of my favorite breweries.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,trumick,4.37,"Pours a clear orange color with a nice half inch head and lots of lacing all around.  Scent is of sweet, biscuity malts, huge piney hops dominate however.  Taste is very nice. Starts out almost sugary sweet with a gigantic hop smack in the face immediately following, piney with a huge dry citrus finish. The grapefruit stays there for an eternity. This has an outstanding hop flavor like no other IPA I have had before. It is bound to offend those not accustomed to big hop flavor.  Mouthfeel is very smooth and even refreshing. Perfect carbination for this beer. It has a medium body (leaning towards full bodied).  Drinkability is on the higher end of the scale. I got this one from my brother in Boise; I wish I had another. Hop burps, yes, this is a very drinkable beer..  This is my first Stone product. If this is any indication of the ability of that brewery, I need to acquire more of these Stone beers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,beersarang,4.55,"I used to HATE bitter beer. IPAs always scared the crap out of me, but decided to give this one a try.  Pours a golden copper which is quite beautiful in the light with an off-white head that is 2 fingers thick and recedes into a thin collar that stays throughout the drinking. Lace is adequate than dissapates into nothing.  Nose is mild with grassy hoppy aromas. Not too strong, but wait till the tasting hits! The smell is deceptive...  At first the malty bready flavor comes in, complex malts with mild toasty flavor. Delicious. Then comes the hop bitterness which is not quite as strong as the bottle claims. Don't get me wrong though, this is an IPA. The hops are there. They are powerful, complex, viciously wonderful. It does kind of have a ruinous effect on the palate. Very well done and revolutionary, and quite balanced. The alcohol flavor comes in and the end, and warms on the way down. One bomber and I can't type accurately right now. ^_^  Goes down much smoother than it should, carbonation is moderate and body is perfectly balanced. PERFECTLY Balanced. Easy drinking and good. I finished the bomber and wanted more.  Stone, you are a group of amazing people. When I have my own brewery in the future, I can only hope to uphold the uncompromising standards that you have.

Flavor: Grab your lapels, slap you in the face and repeat after me: Bitter and tasty. Yup, this is hops. Flowery, grass, and pine forest. To be honest, it wasn't as sharp and harsh as I expected from anticipation, but i don't hold it against the beer.

147,4083,mmmbeer,4.75,"I'm a big fan of Stone's IPA and my favorite style is double IPA so I couldn't wait to try this. 22 oz. bottle with no freshness date and a very cool green and metallic gold silk-screened label. Over 100 IBUs - I can't wait. Pours into my Chimay chalice an amber/orange with a creamy 2 finger head that reduces to a nice thin blanket. Looks like an IPA or a darker pale ale. Lots of hops in the nose (grapefruit, perfume, flowers, pine) along with some biscuity scents. First sip lets you know that you've found a hophead's paradise. Mouthfeel is thick but velvety smooth and it coats the mouth well. Huge flavor - lots of chewy malts contribute biscuit and nut tones, but the powerful hops (mostly citric and pine) bombard the palate and overtake the malts, leaving a bitterness that lingers pleasantly on the tongue for several minutes. The beer has a warming alcohol feeling and alcohol scents/flavors that come through as it warms. I think I'm in love. The only thing that lowers the drinkability for this beer is the availability and price.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Oranges and caramel as well....I have really been looking forward to this. This is what IIPA's are all about...unfortunately, it is what others must be compared to. A ton of hops, but not overly sweet...malty and bitter, but a very drinkable beer. Hint of alcohol in the aftertaste, but the bitter hops are what stay w/ me. The folks at Stone Brewing are tops at what they do...I am one who greatly appreciates it. Thanks!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,santoslhalper,3.49,"Appearence: Pours a nice clear gold with a thin massive tan head. The head is frothy and has great retention.  Smell: Mostly hops, some of which are a pleasent, floral smell... and the others smell like a doctor's office.  Taste and Mouthfeel: The taste is the usual ""in your face"" taste Stone has. The hops are agressive as hell, but the malts are simply not present. There is no balance. This is not a bad tasting beer, just a little off. The mouthfeel is slick and velvety.  Drinkability and Overall: A very good and drinkable IPA. I've noticed as my palate ""matures"", I've been not enjoying the huge, hoppy IPA's as much as I used to. Probably just going through a phase. If you're a hop head, this is your beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The nose is full, lots of citrus and piney hops but with a huge caramal, thick malt backbone that really hits hard. The flavor is damn nice. Sweet and hoppy. Finely balanced sweet and bitter. Stone always makes me a happy boy. I have to say, I found them well before my time here on BA, and I have always respected the beer they make. The feel is thick and wonderful. This beer is much better than I remember it from last time I had it. This beer is well worth trying. So good. So good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BeerFink,4.67,"Pours marginally darker than Stone's regular IPA. That is to say a mostly clear, slightly cloudy orange/amber color. A sticky off-white head tops this one off. Just like the regular IPA, the head retention is remarkable, and the ale gives off sticky lacing. This is one wonderfully aromatic IPA. Pungent hops reek of citrous, pine, and herbs. Sweet esters compliement the bitter notes, while a little alcohol taunts. True to its name, the 100+ IBUs have probably ruined my taste buds (temporarily). Taste is deceptively floral at the beginning. However, that is quickly followed by axe-in-the-face hops. Very sharp grapefruit, orange peels, and pine riverdance on your tongue. Fortunately, Stone is not known for one-sided beers. The hops are balanced by generous amounts of malt and alcohol. Smooth malt, some toastiness, sweet caramel, and some spice break up the 100+ IBUs. Bold mouthfeel lets you know who is boss. Finish is spicy citrous, helped along with warming alcohol, pretty dry. A great double IPA, with some spice and noticable alcohol.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,neonbrown82,4.52,"Thanks to my roommate for picking this up in Arizona over winter break. It was quite a pleasant surprise. This was a very clean looking beer with a clear golden color and a nice slightly off-white head. Head retention was minimal though the brew seemed to be pretty well carbonated. The smell was probably the most spectacular thing about this brew. I can't quit smelling it as I type. The scent is dominated by oranges and roasted hops. The taste is surprisingly well balanced considering that this beer boasts 100+ IBU's on the label. The bitterness is masked by a hint of orange and malts in the initial taste, and the aftertaste lets the hop resins stick to your mouth leaving you craving more long after the glass is empty. This is a fine I2PA and would make an excellent choice for any hop head. I don't quite think the Ruination has ruined the experience of other beers for me though, but Stone's arrogance is forgivable as long as they continue to craft such excellent brews.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,connecticutpoet,4.45,"This one was excellent. A nice, deep yellow brew, with a 2 finger head and lots of lacing, as soon as I began to pour it I knew I was in for a treat.  The aroma of pine and grapefruit came wafting from the glass, inviting me to taste the wonders promised.  The taste... tremendous blasts of bitter pine and grapefruit hops, with a full underlying maltiness providing a base. But the hops were king.  I am VERY glad I finally found this one... and it lived up to the reviews.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,GCBrewingCo,4.5,"The beer poured crystal clear medium amber golden with an off-white head that lasted to lace the glass from rim to bottom.  The aroma was malty with light caramel and a fruitiness of citrusy hops mixed with a complexity of maltiness. Deep frutiness and maltiness mixed in harmony.  The flavor was malty with a creaminess and a citrus maltiness that blends will with the fruitiness of the flavor. The flavor also contained a nice bready flavor that mixed well in the malt and in the hop bittering and flavor.  The finish was just dry with a nice hop and malt impression that both last long and pleasant into the afteraste.The body was medium full and excellent. Alcohol warming was definitely present in the warmth after consumption.  22 ounce bottle.

SRIPA isn't so imbalanced that malt was undetectable; i definitely got some sweetness coming through, but it's still hop through and through. the whole gamut of hot aromas and flavors. i think cascade is what primarly came to my nose. taste has a piney start with citrus in the middle and a whopping bitter finish  give me another; it's worth the hype. belee' dat",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The scent is hops, hops, hops, some citrus tones from the hops. The taste is massively bitter, the first few swigs could ALMOST be described as too much, but i loved them. You got your floral tones, bitter tones, citrus, all great hop tastes. Slight alcohol spice, and slight sweet malt. Fucking awsome, a hop lovers dream.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jahred,2.93,"Ruination pours a light orange with a bubbly white head. Some lacing remains on the glass as I drink, and lots of tiny bubbles shoot up from the bottom of my glass as soon as I pour. The scent gives some sweet malt and piney resin notes, but only very faintly.  The taste is sweet, citrus flavors up front, mixed with grainy malt notes. This leads to astringent, harsh bitterness that lingers on my palage. As the beer warms, the bitterness remains, but the rest of the flavors seem to disappear.  The carbonation is nice, but it's the only nice thing about the mouthfeel - otherwise the beer seems a bit thin. I'd expect even more resin notes from such a hoppy beer. As for the taste, I'm very disappointed. It's overly hoppy, but little hop flavor seems to come through - only a harsh, unbalanced bitterness. I was hoping for, and expecting, more, from Stone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Hits with a clean tight carbonation and good medium body. Detected the caramel sweetness of the malts first, then quickly the citrus bitterness to balance it. Goes down clean and smooth, the hops emerge in a grapefruit and piney blast, quickly lingering in a well-measured amount.  Very smooth for the generous amounts of bitterness. Not the bitterest, but just right for a hop-head session. I have to thank my girlfriend for giving me this opportunity.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Very nice, long lasting foamy white head.  Very nice, citrus (lemons, oranges, grapefruit) some piney notes. If there's one thing Stone Brewing has over everybody else, they make the most fragrant beer.  This has to be the easiest drinking Double IPA ever. I'm going to go out on a limb and say they use something like Magnam of Horizon for bittering because there is zero harshness. Very well done. I just looked in a copy BYO. They say Magnum.  This may be one of the fuller bodied IIPAs on the market. I have had some where the brewer tries to get the alcohol up there, but it comes at the expense of the over all brew.

June 1, 2004 his beer, holy crap, the most bitter beer I have ever had. Definitely an IPA because the alcohol is 7.7%. When you open the bottle you smell the hops. Citrus aromas, piney, sticky hop resins, and floral. The color is a beautiful orange brown and a white head on top. First taste is the maltiness and the flavor from all those hops, then about 1/10 of a second later, the bitterness hits hard. I thought it was too bitter. I took me about 30 minutes to finish a 22oz. My burps smelled good though. It was an interesting beer, not sure if I think it should be at #19, but way too bitter for me.

Pours a clear basic gold under a three finger whipped cream-like head that lasts forever but leaves just a little lace. It features a big pine nose with hints of sweet fruit. With fairly flat carbonation, the liquid sits a bit thick in the mouth. Taste? Yup, there are hops here. Slightly flowery, but mostly pine, there is bitterness from the start, gloriously smooth yet pronounced. Pine sap and espresso combine with a luscious sweet malt to inspire a delicious finish, then the hops come back to leave a dry bite that throws the salivary glands into overdrive long, long after the liquid disappears.

Citrus notes of orange, lemon and grapefruit dance with pine notes and earthy notes. A nice sweet caramel malt background does what it can to hold things together. Lingering bitterness makes the mouth pucker...I don't get it as much going down...but damn does it linger. Yum, yum, yum....did I mention it's yummy?

Yes, the nose is pure hops and yes the first taste is big, bad and bitter but there is a backbone that makes this among the best Imperial IPAs in the world.

This bottle has been cellared for at least 6 months and may have mellowed a bit. The mouthfeel is pretty good, a bit thin for my taste in something this bitter.

Very bitter as well. It takes a little while for the sip to finally complete itself. First, there's the assault of hops on the tongue, then a brief flash of beery flavors, then followed up by a bitter dry finish all over the mouth and throat. After adjusting to the bitterness I can pick up on some other flavors, which is good. I thought this beer might just be hops hops hops, which is ok, but possibly boring. However about halfway down the glass the other flavors start to come out. A bit of alcoholic sweetness, mmmm. Probably a good idea to let this beer warm up for about 10 mins, to let the other flavors come out, otherwise it's all hops. All in all a great beer, it has multiple personalities. Go ruin yourself people.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jvajda,4.89,"Apearance: Golden-copper tone and small, frothy head. Very nice lacing as well. Smell: I smelled the sour hops as soon as I broke it open. Really enticing. Taste: Very palpable hop bitterness. Grapefriut sourness and citiric tones. Its bitterness is not ""dark"" like an English IPA, it refreshing and sour like a classic American IPA. Saltiness increases as it warms. Stone has brewed a winner. Mouthfeel: Lightness in the mouth balances perfectly with hops. Good carbonation. Drinkability: I don't care about its ABV, I can't put it down!  Notes: Is it just me, or is there something similar in the flavor of all of Stone's brews, no matter what the style? It's hard to put my finger on it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Skidz,4.12,"Bottle obtained in collaboration with my bro. Part 1 of the 4 part Stone tasting.  Pours out straight gold and sits golden amber in the glass with a small fluffy thite head that fades to the sides, leaving a nice layer of skim.  Smells very malty with a big blend of hops. Light spiciness with citrus flavors: orange and grapefruit.  Taste is very hoppy up front, makes no attempt to fool you. Crazy amounts of bitterness, big and flowery. Hops rule this beer. Once your mouth adjusts to the punishment, its actually enjoyable. Nutty flavors emerge: hazelnuts and walnuts, them the malts pick up a bit of strength and bring forth some fruity flavors of crabapple and tart pears; mainly unripened fruits. Bitter finish, duh.  Nice and smooth in the mouth with great carbonation. Ungodly levels of bitterness.  To punish oneself with pleasureful hops and intense bitterness is the act of drinking this beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,soper2000,4.22,Why oh why did I have to split this bomber? Chalk it up to advocacy I guess. Pours an electric orange with a rather large white head. Nose was wonderfully hoppy but nothing like Dreadnaught which was my measuring stick for this brew (unfair I know). Large grapefruit hops fade slightly into some spicy notes and a decent amount of malt was present as well. This was definetely not a one dimensional beer in my opinion. Drinkability was fairly high for a double. Great value with it's relatively low price (compared to other double IPA's). Stone has done it again. And I shall be revisiting.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,allengarvin,4.15,"Appearance: Clear golden color, small head of foam.  Aroma: Hops. LOTS of hops. It smells like a bag of hop pellets, so intense that I can't detect anything other than hops.  Flavor/Body: Not as bitter as I expected. Earthy, spicy hop flavor with plenty of bitterness, but not overwhelming. Good balance. If you concentrate on the malt, there's some sweetness underneath the bitterness, but the finish is still fairly dry for such a strong beer. Body and carbonation is medium.  There are plenty of really big IPA's around today, but this one is a superior example, highly hoppy but not tongue-numbingly hoppy. I can't think of any others offhand that have such an explosive, overwhelming hop aroma, though.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,bigchris1313,4.7,"Appearance: Unlike its little brother, this brew pours much closer to orange than a dark gold. A head approximately 3/4-7/8"" forms, but that of course depends on how one pours. It's beautiful.  Smell: Hops hops and hops. Also some spices like the IPA, but even more hops.  Taste: Hopheads rejoice, for this beer brings tidings of great hoppiness. This would rate as the hoppiest beer I've had to date, though I have not sampled the 60, 90, or whatever minute IPAs. I love hops and thus, I love this beer. It scores a 5.  Mouthfeel: Like a good IPA, the brew is thicker than lesser beers, yet thinner compared to a porter or stout. When cool, the beer rolls through my mouth like a slow creek, for lack of a better simile.  Drinkabiliity: This is the only field where Stone's regular IPA surpassed the ruination. I could drink this beer nearly all day, but not quite all day. As wonderful as it is, it's just a hair too powerful to drink indefinitely, as it were.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,FINA,3.24,"Golden color with decent lacing. Mouthfeel is a bit thin. Strong hop bitterness. Piney - resiny hop flavor. Malt was very much in the background.  Two friends and myself did a blind tasting of 4 Imperial Pale Ales, and this one surprisingly scored the lowest on all our scorecards.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,merlin48,4.65,"I picked up three bombers of this at a Tennessee, liquor store earlier in the week, to cellar until winter. When I realized I hadn't sampled or reviewed it before, I couldn't resist the temptation. Damned gargoyles! Served into an imperial pint glass, this Stone pours a regal, golden orange/amber body that is clear, and topped off by a tightknit, two finger, ivory colored head that retains for nearly 45 minutes, finally yielding some magnificent, lacing patterns all over the glass. Very attractive appearance. Hop aromas fill the room, as soon as the first pour hits the glass. Grapefruit, mandarin orange, lemonrind, and spruce, jump out of the glass(and bottle) and fill my den with fragrance. Sweet, honeysuckle adds a floral hops note, as well. Mouthfeel is exceptional. In spite of 100+ IBUs, there is only a minor, hops bite. This is supremely smooth in the mouth, and the carbonation is soft and restrained here. This is a full bodied ale, though, and is somewhat chewy(and yummy). The taste is complex..extraordinarily complex. I spent over an hour enjoying the many nuances and flavors that come forth at different temperatures. First, and foremost, this is, indeed, a hopmonster. Very resinous, at times, but very flavorful most of the way through. Grapefruit, bitter orange, lemon zest, spruce, and pine are the dominant flavors, but this is a well balanced ale with just enough of a sweet malt presence to rein in the massive hoppiness. The 7.7% alcohol is cleverly hidden away somewhere in all the complexities of flavor, and is not even noticed. This one is seductive enough to justify an hour, or so, of your time with. Stone is certainly one of North America's finest breweries, and this IPA is a testament to their skill and art. Double IPAs are not my favorite style, but this one is so supremely crafted that I have spent most of the evening with it. Extremely high drinkability! Ruination is a very seductive mistress, and I look forward to raiding my cellar to enjoy her company again, after the leaves fall and autumn becomes a distant memory.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Beersignal,2.85,"This beer pours a charming and crystal clear golden amber colour and adorns itself with a beach sand coloured cap of foam of average retention.  As would be expected the nose is rich with citrusy hops and freshly cut grass. More subdued aromas of fruits and malt follow but are dominated by the freshness of the hops.  Firm and rounded with a hearty texture this beer opens up with some promise. Malt with some hints of ripe fruits show up early in the taste but are almost instantly overpowered by the hop character. A biting and long bitterness settles on the back of the tongue and loiters for what seems an eternity. Too much unfortunately. The finish is piney, resiny and too bitter for this reviewer. I thought I was a hop head until I had this beer.  This is the second brew I have had from Stone. I do admire the effort put into their product, and the marketing of it. They are certainly skilled craftspeople, however, their style of brewing doesn't suit my tastebuds. I tasted this beer with a great deal of open-mindedness and plenty of positive comments from all... but I couldn't get into it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,meathookjones,4.03,"Review came from a 22oz bottle with the usual stone look to it. This poured out a murky golden color with a tall beige head. The head lasts a good bit and decent sized chunks of lace were left about the glass, as it was consumed. Very hoppy nose here with citric grapefruit and floral notes galore. Not much else came through just hops, hops and more hops. The flavor was damn hoppy as well, bitter citric hops mainly dominated with a bit of earthy notes as well. This really grabs you tongue and doesnt let go very much the palette destroyer that ends in a long lasting dry bitter hoppy finish. Hmm this is pretty light on the tongue for a Double IPA, with a less than medium body to it. Drinkability is hurt a little by the lighter body but it is still good. I would definitely have this again, as the flavor definitely packs the hops you are looking for in this type of brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ramrod666,4.67,"purchased in a 22oz bomber at d's six pack n' dogs in steel city. this beer is truely an attack on the pallet. pours a orange -yellow witha lacy head that sticks to sides of the glass like cobwebs. smell is overwhelmingly hoppy, mostly floral and citrus. taste is off the charts. awesome hop coplexity. so hoppy it amost burns...in a good way. mouthfeel is rather oily, and alcohol definately makes its presence known. drinkability is good but, will probobly shock you tastebuds to where anything less bold will seem bland. a hophead's dream.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Stingray5,4.52,"22oz pours a brilliant, crystal clear yellow/orange with a towering white, large-bubbled head. Heavenly sweet and spicy aroma that tickles the tongue before a sip is had. All signs are pointing to hop assault. Thick creamy mouthful leads to pine and spice hops with a big malt backing. I can literally lick hop oil from my lips after each sip. Finish leaves me with serious, resinous hop burps that few have equaled. I think the hops are actually burning the upper back of my throat. Take your time with this one.  Stone has ruined me with a huge, bold hop presence that gets just the right amount of support to prevent it from being a raw hop-mess and instead be an extreme beer with incredible balance.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,IronDjinn,4.65,"From a brown 22 oz. bottle picked up in Vegas, silk-screened label and the usual great original blurb on the back of the bottle. Enchanting light copper hue, like the sun just popping over the horizon first thing in the morning on a clear day. Decent white head with good retention, it leaves a fair amount of lacing. For a beer with this amount of IBU's the aroma is deceivingly light and floral, with hints of citrus and spice. The flavour also starts mild for the slightest moment, and then the hops sucker-punch you in all their glory, so fresh and vibrant that you are nearly picking leaves out of your teeth after swallowing. Intense at first, but then mellowing out towards the finish in layers of different characteristics, concluded with another kick on the finish. A lot of art, science and religion went into perfecting this symphony of hops, and a whole lotta love as well, to rip off Robert Plant. The more I drink it, the more I crave, this confirms that I have truly crossed over to the dark side...er, I mean have become an official hophead. As it warms the malt starts to make an appearance at first sip, a rich biscuity malt that blends seamlessly in with the dominating hops, and then appears once again on the aftertaste in a citrusy tango. Stone has done an exceptional job on this IPA, it is not merely a one-dimensional free-for-all of excessive hops, they've managed to blend a complex and layered beer for those in the know. A rites of passage for hopheads. Full and rich mouthfeel, not oily or sticky for a moment, true alchemy. The next time I am in the U.S. I shall be loading my suitcase with this stuff. It's like falling in love all over again, I haven't felt this euphoric since I managed to see the Pixies live on their reunion tour this year.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Rastacouere,2.97,"Clear straw coloured, white 1cm head is actually larger than on the regular IPA, but is fully diminishing. Aroma surprises for its not nearly as intense as its made out to be. Straight hops hit the nostrils, earth like, citrus like and mostly fuelic. In mouth, flavors are intense, but hard to put words on. Its very perfumey, somehow leathery, acid, fuelic. Generous alcohol vapours come through. Fine body helps the drinkability a lot with its adequate medium carbonation, but if not thin, its definitely not full. Miles away from a yulesmith or dreadnaughts flexibility. Mostly pure hoppiness and I found nothing to mention about the malt although theres a considerable bill felt.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,NearerMyBeerToMe,4.72,"Pours with an inch-thick, lumpy, cumulus head that actually rolls, putty-like, across the top of the beer when the glass is tilted. Insane head leaves chaotic tapestries of lace. Barest level of carbonation. Beer is like a kaleidoscope of polished brass, pure gold highlights, auburn depths, vermilion sunburst. Ephemerally smooth nosefeel of spring pollen... no wait, mandarin oranges and cheap tequila... no, actually it's golden raisins, stale biscuits, and mint jelly... Note-taking becoming difficult. Sensory overload. Flavors of nectarines and hop vapor. Super-bitter candied orange rinds, grapefruit flesh disintegrating cane sugar. Pink lemonade pine cones soaking in coconut milk. High, warming grapefruit and pine bitterness, wowwww... Marmalade nebula turpentine butter. Marijuana marshmallow! Minutes after swallowing, still probing for flavors. Astonishing balance hits all four corners of the mouth and all points in between. A cool rush on inhaling... Cotton candy mouthfeel...in a double IPA? Are you fucking kidding me?! Seriously, I can't put down my glass. Uh... I just... can't write any more.  Totally irresistible.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,JMH_,4.32,"pours a nice crisp orange amber colour with a frothy sticky head. the body is nice and carbonated too. smell is a hop delight, intermingled with pineapple and a bubble gum juiciness. nice. the flavour is equally inviting though leans more toward hop power than sweetness. it starts our failry mild and a touch bitter before moving into earthy hop flavouring which is very strong and then moving into a bit of sweetness before finishin up with earth and hop again. alcohol is noticeable, though not offensive, here and there as well. this one leaves a nice warm, tingly feeling in your mouth and your belly. it's a tasty treat, to say the least.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,stevef,4.15,"Pours a small ivory colored head that quickly fades. It is a dark gold in color with a very light haze. Very intense aroma of hops but also a lot of malty, sweet smells too. Body is creamy, with a slight oily feeling and is very lightly carbonated. The hops are the first thing the taste buds notice but then there is a surprising sweet malt presence that slowly fades and leaves a powerful hop bitterness that lasts and lasts. There is a brief instant in that hop / sweet malt / hop taste that reminds me of grapefruit with sugar sprinkled on it. From what I had read about this brew, I was expecting to be blown away by the hops so I was very surprised by the malt presence and sweetness. An excellent beer that I really enjoy. My favorite Stone brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,oggg,3.75,"22oz bomber into pint glasses  This beer comes as a pale yellow orange, brilliantly clear liquid. Despite our best attempts, the head was limp and could not be induced to rise, despite our just having rinsed the pint glasses.  Mild hop aroma and some sweet malt. Less than impressive.  A shot of grapefruit is strong. It comes with a monster bitterness that surges every time the malt backbone tries to surface. Alcohol is subtle. Finish is dry. Lingering bitterness. I would say the imbalance towards hops is probably still in the acceptable range for a double, though my preference is for a larger malt presence.  I would actually say this is a medium bodied beer. I had this after the Red Rocket Ale, which was actually fuller.  Overall, I want to try this on tap -- I have a feeling it could have a better showing in all categories.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Padron4KM,4.5,"Pours a beautiful amber color. I half expected a bug to be frozen in the middle. Head was tall and thick, but disapated quickly. Chunky lacing. Aroma was floral and citrus and pine. every swirl of the glass brought out something different. Some honey tried to peek out, but got beaten back by the hops. Flavor was piney and citrusy (ruby red grapefruit), but with a sweet quality in there to balance it out. Lush mouthfeel. Looonnnggg finish. left my lips and tounge tingling and wanting more....",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,rousee,4.42,"I had tried this once before but never gave it its due until I compared it with other IPAs. Pours beautiful peach apricot honey orange-gold.  Head fades quickly- but very nice lace for a bottled beer. Nose has the malty-nutty aroma but ""you no can taste "" this part. One of the better IPAs that I have ever tried. Strong hops / a little malt with a bitter berry taste on the back. Not too different from the big orange IPA all over Boston but I am sure this one is my preference- it is no contest.  Mouthfeel: very nice and thirst-quenching. Smooth and spicy/fruity-very good. Drinkabilty--you gotta drink the 24 oz. in 1 sitting --not too hard to accomplish.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mntlover,4.35,Pours a lightly hazy golden with amber hints with a fluffy white head that leaves a web of lacing down my glass. Aroma is all about hops citrus on top of pine maybe a pinch of floral thrown in for good luck on top of what smells like light malt but isn't. Taste starts out sweet malt and its not light its on the good side of medium and loaded with hops nice sweet floral and citrus flavors mingle in your mouth then it finishes with a good bitter bite on your tounge. Leaving a nice oily pine coating that has the tastebuds senselessly begging for more. Mouthfeel is nice and bigger then it looks on the heavier side of medium allowing the hops room to play. Drinkability is great a tasty Double IPA for sure.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,AlexJ,4.74,"OK I've been trying to age this beer but keep drinking it instead. Looking at a bottle of this beer (or any Stone for that matter) actually makes me salivate the way really, really good food does when you are very hungry. The bottle burps hops the second you open it. It's a bit thick feeling at first with a thin white head. It has a piney, resinous hop bite that is wonderful. Try one with spicy Mexican or Thai food, Mmmm.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Big balance that kicks but each way. Hops & malts with bubblegum & lolipop esters. Aftertaste like lingering bubblegum.  Huge rough sizzle feel. Good mouth sizzle. A bit tacky and syrupy.  Difficult to declare a drinkaility on tap: Good, if careful.  Last swigs: Rugged mixed fruit cup and sandpaper on mr tongue. Hops & malt sizzle.  Beer is good. Happy West Coast beering.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,coasterfreak75,4.04,"The pour was a light golden yellow with a one to two finger head that quickly dissapated and left a thin white lace on top of the beer.  The smell was heavy in hop spice with just a hint of fruit in the back of the nose.  The drink started with a kick of hops, imagine that, not just a plain kick but more like kick your teeth out. The middle was just a slight hint of fruit followed by more hops. The finish was get this, hops. Damn if this isn't a hop head's wet dream I don't know what is. The hops in the finish linger but not too long, it's just right.  Like I said before this is a hop head's wet dream. Don't try this beer if you don't like hops, you won't like it. I love hops and I found this beer to be damn near perfect.

Strong hop bitterness, but still flavorful, which is not an easy thing to accomplish. Minor malt in the middle, but all bitter hop in the finish.

147,4083,Goldorak,3.54,"Sampled 11aug2004, purchased ~3 weeks ago at whole foods market in Vienna, VA.  Translucid orange. I wasn't expecting that at all. Most big IPAs are cloudier than this. Nice chunky head though.  The smell is totally citrus, floral, honey, and something else I couldn't pinpoint until later.  Tasted and felt like lemonade, it dried out the back of my tongue, and the upper part of my throat. Special. Has a slight malty start, then over the top hops and bitterness that overpowers all. Ruination, indeed.  The combination taste/smell reminded me of physalis (cape gooseberries, or ""cerises de terre"" as we call them in Qc), with the tartness mixed with faint fruityness. Interesting.  Overall, I must admit I was a bit dissapointed. Extreme beers of this type are quite uncommon in my area, and are often highly regarded on this site, so maybe my expectations were too high. Next time I'll try to take it at face value, as the palate destroying, saliva-evaporating monster that it is, and not build it in my head before even opening the bottle. I definately enjoyed their classic IPA much more.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,joecast,4.92,"ive been saving this for my one-hundreth review for about six weeks now and have finally got there. its been a long wait though. one of the best looking bottle designs ive seen around.  open the bottle and the aroma leaps out to greet your sense of smell. the hops over-power the nose with splendid fresh picked spicy bitter hoppiness. not so much citrusy as other ipa's from the area, but peppery. i could swear there were whole flowers in there.  pours with a large firm packed dirty white head. only light carbonation. slightly hazy gold in color. leaves behind a sticky lacing from the head traces all the way down the glass as you enjoy every bit.  the taste?? well, a fierce fiery bitterness approaches the tongue first and commences to stomp all over it, thrashing about inside your mouth like a not-so-well behaved rock star in a hotel room. but wait, thats not all. just as it makes itself comfortable, a flood of malty sweetness (just a step below a tidal wave) follows behind to wash it all down. yumm. mouthfull after mouthfull, the same play is re-enacted to a standing ovation from a full house of satisfied taste buds. even as this warms, the bitterness stay just as sharp and only a slight mellowing of the malt, and only barely a hint of alcohol on the tongue or nose.  immerse yourself in this and lose all sense of time. the rest of the world just seems to be put on hold as all your senses (well, most of them) are completely captivated by this fantastic work of art.  while i would love to give this all 5's, i just cant bring myself to do it. the color seems a bit wrong to me, maybe too light?? and the mouthfeel. for a beer this big, i just thought there should have been a bit more substance to it. am i being crazy? yeah, probably. but even with those minor points, this is one awsome beer. id love to try it on tap some day.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The aroma is all hops...resiny, flowery, pepper and pine. The smell is so intense and powerful that I think I could smell it from across the room. Of course, the hop aroma is so strong that you can't smell anything else in the beer. The taste is surprisingly sweet. There's a malty, but also a tany and fruity flavor. The beer gives the impression of freshness and liveliness. It's really something. Finish is bitter, but has enough balance to take the edge off and leave a very drinkable beer. It's exciting, over-packed with character, and a pleasure to drink. The bottle claims are on-target: don't drink a quite, subtle beer after this one.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,niknar,4.62,"Pours out a nice golden / orangish color with a smallish white head. Leaves some nice lacing down the side of the glass. Smells strongly of hops and herbs, with a slight undertone of caramel. Boom! Delicious flavor assaults the back sides of your tongue with bitterness. Tastes slightly of malt, but the main flavor is a delicate balance of what must be many, many varieties of hops. It creates a nice balance overall, but is clearly very well hopped. Finishes very dry with a slight aftertaste that I cannot place. The belch seems to ring of mint or some other herb. Mouthfeel is slightly thicker than I expect for the style, but it is not surprising considering the extensive hugeness of this offering. Overall, this is one of the best beers I've ever tasted.

On the back end of the beer is a mid hop bitterness, and just a little alcohol (not too much). This has a medium body, and a good drinkability.

The citrus aroma rose well above the frothy head of my candle-lit 10 oz pour. The amber brown color indicated the presence of some malt. While I felt that malt presence in the beers full body, I couldn't quite taste it. Perhaps, my tongue was too far gone or the hops too strong.

Orange and caramel join in later. The initial taste of bold bitter herby hop and a bit of spearmint remains strong to the finish. Caramel malt and toffee arrive at mid-taste. Musty wool and mint emerge as flavor begins to fade. A moderately thick body is well carbonated. The balance is heavily dominated by hops. A great beer to be savored.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

There are tones of sour apples as well--a good sour apple taste. Very good and very hoppy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

As the bottle promises, the aroma is all about the hops. Bitter, pungent, fresh hops. Yum.  Taste certainly delivers, in spades! A sharp, acrid, bitter ale, dry on the tongue. Scours every other taste off the palate, no matter what you may have been eating/drinking. Boys and girls, this is not a toy. This is a hop lover's ale - all others need not apply.  I'd offer a mouthfeel but there is none. Liquid hops. finishes fairly clean, but those hops aren't going anywhere.  Stupid me, thinking Stone couldn't hop a beer up any more than they did for their IPA. Personally, this is fun for a lark, but not something I'd put in my regular rotation. Still, Stone continues to impress. They know what they're doing - here's hoping they KEEP doing it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Hibernator,4.38,"I had this out of a 22 oz brown bottle served in a pint glass. The bottle reads "" A liquid poem to the glory of the hop !""...and Stone is not kidding.  The appearance was a somewhat cloudy orange. Significant head on this brew with awesome lacing on the sides of the pint glass.  This beer provides an intense smell of hops and some wiffs of toasted malt.  This Stone Ruination IPA is all about the hop character and then some. I'm tasting herbs, subtle sweet flavors, hops and a tasty smooth finish. Another potent beer from Stone at 7.7% ABV. As with the Stone Arrogant Bastard, this beer raises the bar for American IPA's.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mschofield,4.05,"Pours a cloudy well carbonated orange-amber, topped with a two finger rocky white head. Leaves wide puffy bands of lacing. Citrus and floral aroma, leather, oranges, a bit of honey, leafy and a smack of pine needles. Citrus taste, orange and grapefruit, some malty sweetness shows through all the hop. Oak and pine, very bitter. Medium bodied, but oilyness makes it feel fuller. I still like the regular stone IPA better.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,kmcnair,4.5,"Picked up a growler of this a few days ago... mmm, fresh.  Makes a fluffy white head, with a nice pale golden body, nice lacing on the glass. Nice floral aromatics, piney hops, sweet malts, very balanced nose. Starts out bitter as f*ck, then enter sweetness and piney flavor, its yummy. Bitter dry finish, alcohol is there but not overdone. Medium body coats the mouth nicely and leaves a light sticky reside on the throat. This one is spot on, the ABV is just right in that you could enjoy a few of these and not completely leave yourself face down, dick in the dirt. Praise Stone.  Amen.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,wyllder,3.86,"Ok,  Maybe it's just me and Imperial IPA's, but I've yet to meet one I've liked more than my favorite standard IPA's, and this one's no exception.  Pours a cloudy orange-amber with little-to-no head and some sticky lacing that chases the beer as it recedes.  The nose is grapefruit with an intriguing undercurrent of musky apple. The musky apple comes out stronger when agitated. Very interesting aroma.  First hit on the palate, like most I-IPAs, is all hops. Immediate impression is of a general lack of balance. If there's malt in these waters, it doesn't have a prayer of showing itself until the 4th or 5th sip. Once the hops settle down a bit (they never settle all the way down) it actually reminded me a bit of Hopdevil, which remains my personal favorite. Too bad, though, it's only a fleeting memory because Ruination never lets up enough on the Hops to make it terribly drinkable.  Aftertaste is at once bitter hops and, interestingly again, musky apple. Not bad at all.  By no means a bad beer. And, if you're a big fan of I-IPA's, you'll probably love it.  Wyll-",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BittRnessabounds,3.97,"from notes fall of 03 I just had to know what 100+ IBUs is like. I tend to like hops so i didn't think the bitterness would be an issue, and it wasn't. This poured a lot lighter than i expected, almost the color of a belgian pale ale, but with a very nice head. The smell was pure hops. I love that smell. I swear it clears the sinuses like spicy food. The taste does not mess around. It is hops, hops and more hops. I would not say this is the most balanced beer every, but i don't think that is what they were going for. Good mouthfeel from the sharp bitterness and good carb. I thought this was fairly drinkable. All in all very good. I enjoyed it, but i wouldn't say it ruined me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,waughbrew,4.33,"This beer reminded me a lot of hopped honey. They color was kinda honeyish with a good light creamy head. Good retention. Smelled wonderfully like sweet fresh American hops. A balance of a few fruits - oranges and grapefruits with a little peach. Flavor was sweet and full-bodied, very honeyish, with a lot of the same hop flavors. In addition, there seemed to be some crushed Smarties(those little compressed sugar candies) in there. The flavor was very nice, but only developed half-way. After the initial flavor it started to change and then it was like somebody hit pause and everything stayed the same. The flavor that stayed in my mouth was almost as strong as when the beer was there. There is something to be said about a finish so strong, but I would more flavor evolution would have made it more complex. Hoppy stone beers always leave me with a feeling that sugar-coated hops are stuck to my teeth. Strange. And the bodies of their beers are neat and distinct, but almost fake in a way, like a plastic thickness. Overall very impressive and idiosyncratic.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,MrNuggets,3.12,"Been working on this bottle for almost 45 minutes. About four ounces left in the goblet. Drinking this beer has been a very interesting experience. Excitement filled me as the beautiful orange liquid filled my glass. Reaked of hops and nothing else, pleasant. Once in the mouth the hops became biting. Gripping my mouth and throat all the way. I've always thought hops were my friend. Never would imagine there ever being too much of them. A glimpse of pure bliss that is swiftly destroyed by the crushing force of bitterness drawn out into eternal cottonmouth.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,99bottles,4.52,"This is hop-tea. This is serious. This is enough to make the Arrogant Bastard run home crying to his mother. It was served to me in a pint glass and was a lighter shade of orange-amber with an inch of fuzzy off white head. I didn't need to put my nose near it to smell the hops. This thing OOZES hops. The smell is overpowering; sharp citric flavors, grapefruit and mango, pine and spruce, and uh, hops. The taste numbs your gums. This is insanely hoppy, not necessarily bitter, although its listed as 100+ IBU. Dry finish of lightly toasted malts. Not too heavy on the tongue, and you can't tell the ABV on account of the fact that you can't discern anything except hops. After about half the pint, I found myself happily gluggin away because I was too numb to let the hops bother me. This is an experience for sure, and it is really only for the most extreme of hopheads. If I could find this in a bottle, I would lay it down for 10 years and see what sort of phoenix would rise from the hop-ashes. It's a big boy.  Update: 1.5 years in the cellar has made this incredible. Finally, the hops have blossomed into an expansive bouquet and the malt pairs well. This is so good, they should release this like Port wine, just so you don't get a fresh one and burn your tongue off. Scores adjusted to reflect the excellence that is cellaring this beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,egajdzis,4.42,"Well a fruitfly poured out of mine. It was still alive and was walking on top of the head, so I know it wasn't bottled originally. It was a reddish golden color with a small head. Citrusy hop aroma, and the taste was dominated by hops. A big beer from Stone!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BadBadger,4.23,Serving 22 OZ bottle. This is a mighty fine hopped up ale. Pours a nice rich amber color. A nice descent head forms and stays. The smell is a mixture of fruit and hops. The taste is very good: nice and hoppy. If you enjoy Stone IPA then this is a beer to search out and enjoy.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,beertaster13,4.82,"There is a god and he goes by the name of Ruination IPA. This is an incredible beer all down the board. It pours a sunset looking orange with sappy colors. The head is a slight mocha/white head that is incredible to look at. The smell is a strong citrus smell and the hops will blow your nose off. The malt is there and it adds a nice sweet fruity nose to the aroma. The taste is a hop overload, the bitterness will strike at first but then the sweet almost molasses and fruit will take over and balance out this beer. You can taste a tad bit of alcohol and grain but it is hardly noticeable with the amount of hops in this IPA. Feels medium bodied and smooth and creamy in the mouth, I would drink this any chance I got, this could be the best beer I've ever put to my mouth, yeah it is that good. Stone has just went from a great brewing company to an immortal brewing company in my eyes with this beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mattp,4.79,"Pours a clear amber with a small white head but leaves a fine white lace in the glass. The smell of the hops is immediately noticeable with a citrus alomst pine aroma.  The initial taste is decidedly hops, hop, hops! Then some more hops. A little malt balance then becomes apparent along with the alcohol. This should be on the hopheads top ten list of regular beers to keep on hand.  One of the good ones.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,twilight,5,"Alrightie kiddies, this is it. This is the end of all things beer. I'm so close to giving this beer a five but the lack of a proper head- Then again, it does leave the most delicate lacing on my tulip glass and the bubbles along the side are like soap, and the clearness of the light orangish copper brew are begging me to. It just leaps at you, kind of mysteriously. But must resist because I thought I'd never five a beer. Must resist. Must resist.  There is this wonderfully hoppy aroma, like opening a bag of hops and just inhaling. But it's not harsh like someother hoppy beers, just pleasant and slightly malty with maybe, just maybe the alcohol hinting through. Or is it just the alpha acids reciting their poetry?  The taste. The taste is Mon Dieu. It's like an unholy overtaking of the tongue, assauting it with the hop until beaten into submission and left with the most deliciously bitter tongue known to man. Yeah, the malt is in there somewhere, you can taste it, but the real star is the hop. It's piney, oh is it piney, with a fleeting taste of perhaps oak, not a huge amount of citrus, but this is after all a west coast IPA.  Smooth mouthfeel. I love how Stone has this carbonation that just feels like it's almost not there. It's so non-intrusive. Drinkability. Screw the ABV. I would drink this all night with no regrets. As for the tongue replacement surgery, we'll deal with that later...  The first time I had this last December, I knew after the first sip that I was destined to be a hophead. My brother-in-law and I looked at each other and yelled ""Awww, yeaaah!"" And it's been too long since I've had this. Here's to Stone and here's to the glory of the Hop. This is truly a miraculous beer. Even my burps taste good!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,budsboy,4.82,"Ah, Ruination. From the name to the artwork, the sight of this bottle warms my heart. This is a beer that I can't believe I haven't reviewed yet. It's also the beer that but Stone on a pedestal in my world.  Pours a crystal clear deep orange with a rocky white head.  Smell is wonderful. If fills the nostrils and the Pavlovian response kicks in. Citrus, pine and a hint of carmel malt worm into the nose and bore into the depths of the mind. Gimme, gimme, gimme.  Taste is exceptional. Citrus and pine hops fight for your attention and pine almost always comes out on top. Nearly puckering in hoppiness, this beer doesn't lose sight of malt. These hops stick around long after the malt is gone. I mean the *stick* around, like duct tape. Every bit of the 7.7 ABV is utilized here, warming as it goes.  It's perky in the mouth, nicely carbonated and light -- not fairy light but ""walk towards the light"" light.  Drinkable? Pshhhaaa. You kiddin' me? This is nectar. This is expansive. THIS is a damn fine contribution to humanity.  Expand your world. Before you die, you must have this beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,shirfan,4.32,"Finally, Premier Gourmet is carrying Stone brews.  This one let out a strongly sweet aroma as soon as the cap was bent; notes of honey and floral hops. Taking a deep breath above the glass results in an almost medicinal, solvent smell.  Pours out a rich amber, with decent lacing from a thin head.  Taste: A hop monster indeed, but one of stealth and precision. I was expecting a huge pine and citrus bludgeon; instead this stays lightly sweet and flowery with a stilletto of bitterness that is felt rather than tasted. Floral hops prevail (an understatement), followed by just a hint of citrus and honey-like malt. Only well into the aftertaste does this dry a bit; but it has none of the sticky mouthfeel typical of IPAs. Seemingly minutes after the hops stop tingling, alcohol fleets in the shadows.  Opens the sinuses, attacks the upper cheeks with that ""zing"" sensation; I feel myself getting warm but continue to sip, a willing victim. Macro drinkers would assume they had swallowed a weapon of mass destruction...only the most devoted hop heads need apply here.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Sammy,4.07,"A double IPA experience. Great floral pine citrus smell. Nice dark orange color. Cellared for a couple of months, and found balanced in bitterness and only a bit hoppy.

147,4083,hustlemuscle,4.17,"Golden and well headed. Thick lacing with what looks like orange pulp.  Nice citrusy stench.  How many kinds of hops are there? Does this beer have them all? Starts citrus, ends piney. Good begining, middle and end. Just can't describe it.  Good n' tart. Starts with smooth citrus and rolls in with the pine blast. Ends with a cheeck pucker hopheads dream of.  Suprisingly easy to drink for such a big beer. The good ol' hoppy cheek pucker, but not nearly as over the top as the taste.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,longpondbeerman,4.42,"The ruination is a wonderful brew; it pours a light amber with a reasonably thick off-white head. The lacing is slick and spotty. There's lots of citrusy hops and cedar sweetness with a touch of honey malts, quite similar to its younger sibling, the regular Stone IPA. The mouthfeel is medium thin, and the taste is deliciously intricate: hoppy, a bit of syrup undertow, and with good tight bitternesss at the finish. Not as potent as the Dreadnaught or the I2PA, but you still get a clear sense of high alcohol in the taste.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,GreatPondBrewer,3.92,"Light amber bordering on yellow with a delicate white head. Some lace. Smell was very good with bitter notes and a syrupy estery undertow. Taste was much more subdued than I was expecting from Stone. In fact I think this beer was less abrasive to the pallette than the regular Stone IPA. Up front was that syrupy Double IPA sweetness, which morphed into a more piney bitter taste, but towards teh finsh and aftertaste was a serious toasty flavor more akin to a british beer or a softer New England IPA. This holds its own and is a good beer, but I will stick to the IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,PartyHatjo,3.52,"sampled this in a bomber complements of nvsblman...on to the review.  Appearance: Pours pale orange/yellow amber with an airy white head that laces very well.  Aroma: Hops, hops and more hops. I detect a bit of honey in the nose, but mostly a piney hop aroma. Alcohol present as well in the background.  Taste: Again hops on the tongue. More citrus apparent in the flavor than in the aroma. Tastes almost like a traditional sunday morning breakfast I had as a kid: grapefruit with a bit of honey on top to sweeten it up a bit. Not enough of a malt backbone, though, the thin body takes the tast down a bit.  Mouthfeel: Body is a bit light for the amount of alcohol and hops present.  Drinkability: Definitely feel the alcohol hit you, due to the lighter body. I don't recommend drinking this on an empty stomach (bad idea). But, I would get it again if I saw it on the shelf (and I prefer it to the other Stone brew I've had so far: Arrogant Bastard).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,WesWes,4.57,The beer pours a nice golden color with a thick creamy white head; beautiful. The aroma is great! It has a nice mild malt scent with an intense floral hop arrangement. The aroma hits you as soon as you pop the top. The taste is great as well. It has a rich pale malt core with some light crystal malts. The hop flavor is very nice. It is extremely bitter and piney. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a great drinking beer. It is quite complex and full of flavor. It goes down easy and finishes very bitter; a fine sessions beer.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I am a hop head, but I'm amazed to say that I've found a beer that IMHO is TOO hoppy...Its out of balance, but obvioulsy balance was not the goal here. Tasty, high quality stuff w/o a doubt, but this ones not for me. I'd rather drink and savor one of Stones other creations  Re-review 11-06, PLEASE, what was I thinking?

More SD style DIPAs for me, please!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Southernbrew,4.65,"Recently sampled the Stone IPA and now it's time to face the legendary Ruination. Here goes.  Pours orange-amber with a 1 inch bubbly head.  Knock out piney hops aroma. God it's hard to hold back. Focus. Focus. Some grapefruit in there as well. No real alcohol noticable.  Oh man, full body, very little carbonation. Very smooth, especially for an IPA. Ravaging hoppiness. Almost oppressive piney flavors with a delicious bitterness pushing its way through as well. Light grapefruit flavors compete for space, but pine dominates. Alcohol is well hidden, better than most IIPA's. I am breathing hops, absolutely nuts. Finally winds down and finishes with a dry bitterness.  The bottle doesn't lie, my palate is gone. No more good beer for me tonight. This is bar none the greatest IPA I've ever had. Fantastic!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,soilguy,4.18,"I can sum this up with words from the bottle - 100+ IBU's! An explosion of bitterness assaults your tongue at the first sip. Surprisingly, this beer had only a slight hop aroma - alchohol dominated the aroma more than the hops. Malt and sweetness are almost imperceptable under the onslaught of hop bitterness. I even had trouble distinguishing hop flavor - it was all bitterness. Nevertheless, I would put this beer up in the upper tier of the imperial IPA's, just a notch below the 90 minute IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,RocketWidget,4.52,"Man, Stone sure knows how to kick my butt with beer! Pours a very gold color with a good head. Smell is of hops and crispness, almost like a pilsner. Taste is absolutely excellent, exactly how a IPA is supposed to taste. Outstanding hops dominate here, with a crisp bitterness and a bold, bitter flavor that the meek cower before. Slight sweetness of the malt bows before the hops of this powerful IPA. Highly recommended!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,rdrummer,4.35,"Another joy of a beer from Stone. The bomber is interesting in itself but not as hilarious as the Arrogant Bastard. The beer pours a rather palish golden color that is clear with a foamy white head. There is a good amount of lacing down the glass.  The smell is all hops to me with that citrusy undertone and a big alcohol aroma as well. There is also a good deal of maltiness but it is subservient to the hops.  This is a hops lovers' delight. It is a big beer with the typical bitterness and citrusy flavor underneath. There is also something floral about the beer, but I'm not sure where that comes from. This is bitter enough that you begin to get that puckering feeling at the end.  It is medium bodied in the mouth with a crisp and clean feel as well, very drinkable although it could dry you out from the bitterness.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,RedDiamond,3.47,"Ruination is very pale for an IPA, and very clear. The smell is a virtual hop garden. It is not just abundantly hoppy, but possesses a crisp arboreal clarity that lights up the olfactory senses. The head is tall and off-white and settles fairly soon. The carbonation is gentle.  But dammit, theres just too much hops in here. Ruination has exceeded any reasonable capacity to produce an appreciation of hops by bombarding the imbiber with an obscene hop overkill. We are denied any sense of subtlety or balance. The sublime nuances of the sacred herb are obscured in their own saturation with a resulting hop profile thats obese and unwieldy. It delivers an aftertaste that is more of an after-sting and fails to satisfy the palate.  Ruination supplants grace with gross. It is testimony to the notion that too much of a good thing is not a good thing at all. In my view, it is better to honor limits with style and achieve greatness with balance -- a refined palate will seek subtlety over saturation any day.  Ruinations mouthfeel holds together surprisingly well for a brew thats over-hopped. But it gets a little gritty in the end. One almost senses they named this beer with the foreknowledge that an ideology of extremes is imprudent yet destined to achieve mass appeal. They really are arrogant bastards down there. Almost as much as I am.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,TinusTime,4.15,"Pours a vibrant golden orange with a offwhite fluffy head.. The head didnt retain that well, but that could be due to ABV or the amount of hops something. The smell is a hopheads dream.. piney woodsy, citrus, floral. You name it its in there. Taste is nice and not as bitter as one would exepect. Starts off citrusy then the malt balances it a bit and finishes with the piney floral hops.. This is one hoppy hoppy brew.. Never overwhelming, just a punch of hop love. As the label says dont bother with anything you want to taste after drinking this as your taste buds have been scrubbed into nubs.. Have one of these then have a couple of those Macros that got left behind in your fridge and you wont be able to tell. Hop burps are off the chart on this one.

147,4083,taez555,4.74,"This beer poured an orange/tan body with a creamy white head.  The nose was HOPS. I mean pure HOPS. Sweet, malty, soft black pepper, sweet pepper, hot peppers, citrus peel, fresh grapefruit, sugar. Very clean and crisp, but just dominated by this almost ambrosial hops smell. Really quite amazing.  The taste was a pure hop attack. Medium to full bodied. It starts soft then is followed by a bigger pepper/citrus attack. Clean and very smooth sugary sweet malt from start to finish. Surprisingly, the bitterness sits perfectly in the mix. Its bitter, but compliments the malt just right. Its the hop flavor that attacks you here.  What a great beer. Your senses really do go numb while drinking this baby. One of the best double IPAs out there. I could drink this beer all day long.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,RockyTopHeel,4.53,"22 oz. bomber  I'll say this much: this is one of the coolest looking beers I've ever seen. I've described other brews as glowing, but none came close to the searing, molten lava radiance of this bright yellow-orange creation. A relatively aggressive pour resulted in little more than a wispy white lace atop my Ruination, which I split with my roommate after he finished taking part of the CPA exam.  The smell is beautiful as well, with tart citrus sweetness, floral hops, and a twinge of alcohol in the nose. Mmmm...intense, but not nearly as brutal as you might expect (side note: I haven't been able to taste much else in the couple hours between writing this review and posting it, but my tastebuds were rocked to sleep, not pummelled). Deep layers of hopped complexity and citrus (more grapefruit than orange) flavors, with a touch of sweetness, refreshing bitterness, and crisp finish. Very drinkable as well.  I'm a big fan, though honestly, I give slight preference to Stone IPA over the Ruination--of course, I also consider Stone IPA one of the best beers I've ever had. Go figure.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jonnylieberman,3.23,"Poured from a 22 ounce bomber into my snifter. Copper, orange/brown hues. Lack of red indicates lack of cyrstal malts. Off white head with larger than normal bubbles. Nice lacing.  Smells like Cascade hops. Some grapefruit and tangerine is present. A tiny bit of malt gets through -- some raisin also.  Tastes like raw hops. Intense bouquet up front that quickly turns bitter and then a very bitter aftertaste. A little bit of sweetness saves Ruination from being an undrinkable novelty beer. Very sharp, almost harsh feeling from the CO2 which is somehow OK.  Almost no mouthfeel whatsoever. Except that your gums are burning.  This beer needs more body to be truly drinkable. Too damn thin. The aftertaste is nice and long, but the medicine like bitterness just doesn't make it enjoyable enough. It is drinkable only because it is so alcoholic.  Notes: Um, come on Stone, you can do better than this. I mean yeah, you now hold the title for world's hoppiest beer. So what? Almost nauseating to get through an entire 22oz. First four ounces are fine.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,bditty187,4,"Clear coppery honey-peachy in hue with a noticeable ruby glow, the slightly off-white head reached a sticky finger in height. This is an attractive looking beer. The head retention was decent; it faded to a soapy jumble after some time. The subsequent lacing was sporadic and unorganized. The aromas of the bouquet unleash a wrath of citrusy-piney-flowery hops, caramel sweetness underneath. The potency is solid; I found the smells to be inviting but not earth shattering. The palate is tasty; the huge angry hoppiness is so impressively mouth-filling. Before I can even swallow if feels like I have a bushel of freshly picked hops resting squarely on my tongue. The bitterness is formidable but the flavors are very delicious, hugely piney with citrus notes working in conjunction, flowery underneath. The heat of the alcohol is obvious and it imparts some flavor. The harshness is moderate. Pleasant rawness. Maybe this is an inherent flaw of the IIPA but where is the malt delicacies? I wasnt that impressed with the Stone IPA either; this is a bigger beer and, yes, a better beer. I cant refute how yummy the hops are, I just want more malt or even a better blend of hops. 3Fs Dreadnaught manages to be a better-crafted hop monster. I do love IIPAs but I find them hard to review but very fun and enjoyable to drink. Drinking these beers are like going to the driving range a ripping your Big Bertha driver 300 yards over and over again. Yeah its fun but it isnt golf! I want to drive, chip, and putt. In other words, the complexities are lacking, it is just hops. The mouthfeel is medium/medium full with prickly carbonation. This is a very drinkable and lovely beer but I am enjoying it for its brashness. Yes, I would drink this again. I purchased a 22-ounce bottle in Loveland.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Zorro,4.32,Pours a hazy red gold ale.  Smell is malt and fruit and some hops. Big Floral Hop aroma smells good.  Taste is malt and then butterscotch and then a wall of hop bitterness.

Flavor is HOPS!!!, Syrupy, canned peaches and pears and apricots. oh yeah and Alcohol, like solvent alcohol, harsh.  MF is pretty good, maybe slightly heavy but it's suitable.  Overall, I'm enjoying this because it's big on hops and alcohol, but it's not as complex as other I2PA's. It's heavy on hops and alcohol and therefore far and away better than the vast majority of brew and actually I don't feel this is Stone's best job of masking high alcohol levels at all.

And while Ruination IPA does immediately evoke tears from my eyes, the beer progresses so resolutely in flavor that, by the time my brain processes the veritable toxicity of this drink, it has already moved past its bittering and into creamy malts and sticky, floral, nectarous hops. The aggressive bittering is up front and on the finish, but the mid-palette is a proud display of America's finest hops.  Hints of phenols and alcohol give the brew a wonderful spiciness to complement the resinous hops. Ruination IPA is so complex (or big, at least) that you could probably taste anything you wanted to in this beer from yeasty floral esters to hop-driven grapefruit and mangoes to antifreeze and jet fuel. Unfortunately, it focuses on the latter.  Unlike any other Stone brew, Ruination lacks subtlety and balance.  Though beautiful at cellar temp, the delicacies of this beer are lost to alcohol and resin once it warms.  Incidentally, this beer made my toes numb.  Relax, relax. ng",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,sprackops,4.17,"Appearance: 22oz bottle with a thin layer of sediment on the bottom. Poured into a 19oz nonick pint glass, leaving most of the sediment in the bottle. The beer comes out a beautiful shade of orange, with steady carbonation feeding an impressive head. Surprisingly clear in the glass.  Smell: The first impression I get is the scent of sweet pineapple that one can smell half a room away. Greater detail reveals interesting pine and strawberry notes, with just a hint of alcohol. The alluring perfumey smell is certainly a high point.  Taste: On the first sip the tongue is coated in a light bitterness, drying things out considerably. Further exploration reveals the massively complex hop character: grapefruit, mint, flowers, pine. Simply amazing what the hops are doing in this brew. The malt finds its niche in the flavor profile, however, imparting a slight sweetness and bready character, just barely fighting through the hop onslaught. There's a notable presence of yeast throughout this unfiltered IPA as well, adding additional flavors of which a particular earthy note is worth mention. Dry and citric in the aftertaste. While a bit overwhelming, it tastes wonderful.  Mouthfeel: Slightly creamy with moderate carbonation. Hop oils abound. Leaves a bit of a sticky feel behind. Absolutely nothing wrong here, though I couldn't say it's exceptional.  Drinkability: Due to the highly complex and hoppy nature of this beer, I couldn't have more than one or two in a sitting, personally. On the other hand, the ABV is pretty well under control for a double IPA, so I couldn't say I'd expect it to put anyone out for the night. Certainly not a session beer, though.  My only complaint is that it does seem to have a temporary ruinous effect on the palate, making it difficult to pair with food. Overall a very rewarding experience. Once again, Stone has clearly come through for us American hopheads.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,edchicma,4.28,"Exceptional head and lacing...smell was a bit resinous yet, slightly fruity. Taste was over the top...bitter, bitterer and bitterest...leaving a fantastic aftertatste...a hophead's delight. Mouthfeel as expected was a bit dry, the way a fine brew like this should be. Not too bad on the drinkability scale, although more than one 22 oz bottle might be a bit much. A must try for hop lovers.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,xgrigorix,4.58,"Twenty two ounce brown silk screened bottle, no dates.  Bright orangey golden colour. Topped by a dense, creamy looking white head. Excellent head retention, & tons of sticky lace left clinging to the glass.  Hop aromas that will clear out your sinuses. Bright, brash, & orangey, with hints of tangerine. Some nice malt lurks in the background - way in the background.  Orange, pine, tangerine, like some sort of demented marmalade. Just enough sweet caramel hangs around to give it a backbone, keep those hops from burning a whole in the tongue. Smooth, creamy, medium bodied. Those hops keep me coming back for more!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,watermelonman,4.12,"There's obviously a lot of hop action in this bottle.  This sits with that nice orange and copper color that good IPA's have, maybe just a touch darker than normal. The smell is of hops and not much else. Considering the bitterness and hop content, the taste is actually pretty well-balanced.  Where the regular Stone IPA was outstanding, this beer is merely great. It's just a touch over the top, but still very well done.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Foxman,4.67,"It pours a quite clear orangey copper, looking crisp and rich. One finger of white head swells, then ebbs fairly quickly to a sparse pool of froth. Sticky, thin lacing remains behind, plastered to the inside of the glass.  Far and away, hops own the aroma, with first dibs going to the thick column of juicy citrus, and a close second going to a dense pillar of spicy flowers. Meanwhile, a creamy malt sweetness lurks seductively, giving just enough evidence of itself to promise more in the flavor.  The first wave of flavor is from the sassy citrus hops bearing floral notes and grapefruit essence. Flowing in next is an increasingly assertive almost sugary toasted malt sweetness. Dry hops bitterness slides along the sides of the tongue as a brief caramel/vanilla duet plays across the palate. The finish is a slow fade of each element, with the hops bitterness lingering longest. While certainly complex, the flavor is a smoother balance than the aroma might lead you to expect.  Medium bodied, the oily hops chracter veritably lubricates the palate, sending flavor far and wide. Hops glow tangibly on the tongue at the finish.  There's a lot here to balance, but it manages impressively and brings an ocean's worth of complex yet smooth, creamy flavor to the table. The strident hops profile gives an enticingly raw edge to the overall perception. The ABV is moderate and is in no way limiting. I'd greedily drink as many of these as I could get my hands on. The blurb on the back of the bottle says this beer will ruin your palate, but in no way does it do that. Rather, it woke my palate, and opened its eyes to how good some beers can be. If every beer I have for the rest of my life is half as good as this, I'll die a happy man.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,krberg,4.24,"Bronze with a nice white head. Fairly low on CO2.  Smells like I expected their IPA to. Huge hop aromas. Actually reminds me of Smuttynose's IPA aroma (freshly opened bag of hops). More citrusy though. Lovin' it.  100+ IBUs my pasty white ass! Where's the bitterness? All malt and flavor hops... Damn bottle misled me again. The malt reminds me of the crust of real bread. I suspect my sample is about a year old, but still the hops taste very fresh.  Feels nice and medium full. It works very well with the hoppy taste. Smooth as hell.  I'm beginning to think that provided a beer is halfway decent I could drink a lot of them. What does that say about me? 7.7 doesn't even phase me here.  I think that Stone may be to me (and a lot of BAs) what Guinness is to the Irish wannabes: infallible. Like Stone but never had Ruination? Buy it. Don't like Stone? Leave it at the store and GFYS! (1st word: Go, last word: YourSelf. Get the picture?)",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BuckeyeNation,4.7,"Rich orange-amber and lighter than expected. The cream colored head is tinted with a hint of lemon yellow and looks like a thick dollop of whipped cream sitting atop the beer. Glass decoration is very nice. There's a copious amount of sticky lace in sheets and rings.  The nose is a wonderous thing to behold, with loads and loads of pungent, floral, fruity, piney hops. The flavor is wall-to-wall hops, but it isn't as abrasive as expected. A tidal wave of hop flavor hits the taste buds instantly and maintains its intensity through the long, bright, hoppy finish. Flavors include grapefruit, lemon, orange and pine in one glorious, sticky, sweet rush.  There's an undercurrent of malt, but it remains in the background where it belongs. Stone Ruination is definitely bitter, but this brewery has a way of making beer with a massive amount of IBUs seem almost sweet and buttery. Which brings me to...  ... the mouthfeel, which is all kinds of wonderful. It's full and rich and silky smooth and heavily creamy and perfect. The alcohol is expertly masked, with no hint on the palate, though it does result in a pleasant warming sensation as the beer is swallowed.  I have to hand it to the boys at Stone once again, this is truly a wonderful beer. Both IPA and Ruination are great, but I'll have to give the nod to the little brother. This DIPA is still a treat and will be a 'go to brew' whenever huge amount of hops are required. Which is most of the time.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,pmowen,4.6,"Appearance: A cloudy golden color with an impressive head for an IPA. Dense curtains of lacing coat the inside of the glass.  Smell: Very aromatic. Floral notes with a light sweetness to the nose.  Taste: Very hoppy yet some how balanced, or, at least, as balanced as a Imperial IPA should be. In other words, grain bill backs up the copious hopping and while there is a very strong hop taste it never approaches astringency.  Mouthfeel: Slightly syrupy, oily and at the end, dry. Very nice.  Drinkablity: I could drink it all night although at almost 8% I'd be paying for it in the morning.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Edwin,3.46,"Appearance - Pours a nice hazy orange/amber color. Creamy head on top, disappears and leaves some lacing. Nice looking brew.  Smell - I have no idea what I am smelling in here. Some sort of corny/grassy odor laced with a big hop presence. Rather confusing scent, similar to the Arrogant Bastard.  Taste - This may be an acquired taste, so I will keep trying this solely based on the hype. I thought this tasted like wet grass. The hops are in there, but are hidden inside this strage complexity of varying tastes...not all of them good.  Mouthfeel - Smooth and unassuming going down. A mellow feel.  Drinkability - If this is your type of flavor, go for it. It is easy to drink if you can get past the smells and flavors.  Overall - I was a tad let down, but I am sure I'll come around eventually. Maybe Stone should think more about brewing than the literature on their bottles (which is a beer bottle equivalent of War and Peace).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,stewart124,4.89,Golden Yellow color with little white head that leaves fast. Strong aromatic smell of floral and citrus/spicy notes. The taste is nothing short of delicious with a very tangy/bitter flavor. Very bold malts that just please the tastebuds and then a extreme bitter flavor that overpowers everything else and whacks the tastebuds senseless. This beer just shocks your mouth. There are slight pine and citrus tastes. This beer finishes dry with earthy tones and again a slight citrus taste. This is really a quality brew and I think I could drink this all the time. Another great one by Stone.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,sideshowrob,4.97,"This is what a massive IPA should be. This beer is delicious... Heed the bottle's warning label though, this is a beer for the dedicated hop-head only.  Appearance is very, very good - an almost glowing light amber color. Full of promise. The aroma is out of this world. Like Hop perfume! Taste is almost indescribably goood. Unlike other big-hop beers, there is no competition among the hops for taste or character. The hops in this brew are all singing the same, wonderful song. Very well done indeed. Mouthfeel is refreshing, smooth and zesty. As you may have guessed, I had no problems drinking this beer down either. I could easily have several over some pool or darts. (If only distro was a bit better for Stone in my neck of the woods.) A truely exceptional brew!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,rajendra82,5,"This beer is the stuff of dreams for any dedicated hop head, such as myself. What a glorious experience indeed. The body is liquid gold, with an inch and a half thick head that crowns atop it. The carbonation in the underlying liquid is picture perfect, and the thick body slows the ascent of the tiny bubbles down noticeably. The head recedes down to a quarter inch in height, but never completely fades. Lacing is excellent as the beer goes into me.  The aroma is like being airdropped into a pine forest. The cascade hops assault the palette with their pine resin like quality from the first sip. The flavors of grapefruit, butterscotch, peach, pear, and sour apple are also evident as let the beer lap my tounge.  On most other IPAs the hop burps are the last thing to enjoy after the beer, but here, they come after just a few sips. The malt backbone is quite solid indeed, but is only there to hold up the hops. The alcohol is in there somewhere, but under the blanket of hops you never taste it, until your head starts spinning. The mouthfeal is creamy, and the drinkability is so good, it is scary.  For me this is the pinnacle of the art of brewing. A beer this good does not come around often. Every beer lover should try this at least once. If you are not a hop head before, this beer may well convert you into one. Thank God, Liquid Solutions ships to Georgia. This beer will be on my shopping list during the next beer run to Chattanooga. And when that dreaded ABV cap is lifted, it will be hard to pick up anything else when I see Ruination on the shelves.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,FormatKid,4.89,"Purchased a 22oz bomber from Bacchus in Chattanooga. I could barely wait to get this thing home and chilled so I could try it. Also had to try to not be intimidated as this is the first Imperial IPA I've tried.  As soon as I begin the pour I'm immediately greeted by a luscious floral, citrusy hops aroma. Enough to make my mouth water. If this is a sign of whats to come then I know I'm in for a treat.  The appearance is golden-yellow in color, with minimal head or lacing to speak of. Carbonation is slight and small. On closer inspection of the scent, I am barely able to detect any malt smell at all. Just that beautiful mixed citrus blossom hop aroma.  On the first sip those hops just dance around my tongue, from the front to the back working their magic.I can feel the warmth of alcohol ever so slightly at the back of my throat. The pine bitterness is much more noticable in the taste than the smell of this delicious brew. Every sip I can feel the flavor working its magic on the different sensory areas of my tongue, registering sharply on the sides. Mouthfeel is perfect for the style, clinging ever so slightly inside my mouth; just long enough to bite in and gyrate and then go down smoothly.  What can I say? This beer is definately one of the best I've tasted so far! The sensation is hard to describe but every mouthful has a diversity that just gels together so well which makes this brew a joy to partake of.  I'll have to quote the bottle on this one: ""A liquid poem to the glory of the hop!""",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,crackerpooch,3.95,"Presenation- 22 once brown bottle with Stone's usual snobby coments on the back  Appearance- Pours a white two finger head that laces slightly and sticks around throughout the drink. The beer is a very light orangish-amber with a slight haze.  Smell- Hops, all hops.  Taste- Starts with a slight malt sweetness. Ends very dry with a big bitter hop bite that lingers in the back of the throat and almost forces you to take another drink. As the beer warms, the hop character becomes too much. Mouthfeel is light to moderate and very good.  I would have been more impressed with this beer if it hadn't psyched me out with the cocky back label. The label entices but also takes some of the mystique away form the brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Morris729,4.92,"Pours golden orange in color with a tremendous frothy white head that coats the walls of the glass with spider webs of sticky lace as it ever so slowly dissipates. Nose is very floral and pungent hops with notes of pine, cedar, and a bit of fresh citrusquite sniffable. Even from the first sip, the bitter hops are an assault upon all your taste budsacidic grapefruit rind blended with pine oils followed by raw hop leaves and slick hop resins that coat the entire inside of your mouth and throat and do not go away until you take another drink. Once the initial bite of the hops subsides a bit, some notes of juicy citrus fruit and sweet malt are also noticeable. An absolutely exceptional IPA. The warning on the bottle that your palate will be completely ruined after you drink is quite true; so since I am currently unable to taste anything else, what am I to do? (Except to have another Ruination, of course.) Purchased from Liquid Solutions.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,sulldaddy,4.29,"I pour a chilled sample into my glass. This bottle talks a lot about hoppiness and anot being for ""non-hopheads"". Guess I'll try it anyway. The brew pours orange and slightly hazy, no real head develops just a thin layer of off white bubbles around the edge of my glass. Aroma is all hops, which isnot surprising. I get citrus notes mixed with a floral character and even some earthy scents to. Very diverse hop presence. First sip reveals a prickly carbonation and medium bodied brew. Flavor is similar to aroma with hop dominance, some sour notes make me pucker a little and the finish is very dry and piney, makes me want to take another sip. This is a well made IPA, but I personally wish I could detect some malt character.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,HardTarget,4.4,"Aroma: while the hops waft gently in waves of bitter glory, a solidly sweet malt base backs them. The Cascade hops come through, but there are obviously more varieties as well. It has a slight perfume quality and a touch of spice, vanilla maybe? Appearance: The slightest haze in this thick looking peach colored beer. The center of my tumbler is slightly darker, more amber, than the yellowier edges. A thick ocean froth head of white creamy bubbles crowns this beauty and streamers of lace reach back toward the lip and paint the lower part of my glass. Kept it&#8217;s head about it throughout the beer. Flavor: Very citric with classic Cascade grapefruit notes, but also some orange and again with the spices, a hint of clove? While this is supposed to be a hop monster, I found it fairly well balanced. Hops definitely show off, and there is no real sign of sweetness, it just doesn&#8217;t crush my palate as much as I expected. Mouthfeel: Triggers an initial chew, but slides right down with a hop oil reminder of its presence. It has a medium-thick body and a slight numbing quality. Overall Impression: A great beer, no doubts, but as for crushing my palate, this just fell a bit short. In fact, it helped me enjoy a side of Gouda and Sharp Cheddar. I&#8217;m thinking I might have gotten an aged bottle, but I&#8217;m not sure (no date on bottle). By the way, many thanks go out to weefishheads for helping me acquire this bottle. This is a complex and well-made beer, but I find the Stone IPA to be a bit more hop-intense. Again, could just be my bottle. Regardless, strongly recommended, with or without aging.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,PSUDREW,3.84,"Pours a nice amber color Has a thick creamy head, not to much lace.  Like some others, I found that the Bitterness is severly cut by the malt. I had 2 bottles this evening, and honestly, the hop profile, while great, was not the punch in the face that I expected. This is not to say that the beer isn't great ( it is), it is just not as hoppy as I expected from hearing from other about it. This is not to say the hop presence isn't felt, or isn't appreciated, but, like I said, it wasn't the punch in the face I expected. The flavor is not unlike the 60 or 90 min IPA, i has the rich, citrusy hop flavor, wiht a nice balance from the malt profile they got going on here.  The mouhtfeel is nice, meduim in texture, not light enough to pound back relentelessly, but not thick enought to only stomache one.  This is a well put together beer, and merits much more consumption. Indeeed",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,silenius,4.49,"Those of us in Chicago aren't lucky enough to have this beer available in the city.  It pours an orangish cloudy amber color with a generous head. Half a glass of head is easily accomplished. Lacing down the ""top end"" of the glass.  The smell is piney hop scent. B-I-G. Just the smell gets my mouth watering.  The taste is a bit one dimensional, but what a great dimension to behold! HOP HEAVEN.  Mouthfeel is smooth and slick. Full and robust.  I could and will have more than one at a setting. The hops are not so overpowering that you can't have another, no matter what the marketing hype says. Enjoy!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,WetCoaster,4.57,"Appearance: A somewhat chill-hazed deep golden/pale orange body with an initially massive off-white head. It settles down quickly into a more manageable rocky, chunky quarter-inch that lasts throughout the pint.  Smell: Perfect. Starts off with a monstrous spicy hop scent. There&#8217;s also a moderate scent of pine oil, with a crisp citrus aroma throughout. Somewhat unusual for the style is the trademark buttery scent of diacetyl, which gives it an almost California Zin property. If there&#8217;s a better nose on an IPA out there, I haven&#8217;t run across it.  Taste/Mouthfeel: I actually noticed the mouthfeel first, a buttery soft, pillowy marvel no doubt assisted by the hop oil and big (7.7%) ABV. Given everything up to this point, I expected this to be the IPA to end all IPAs, but the taste, while fantastic, isn&#8217;t the stuff of legend. You get huge hops, again the buttery diacetyl. But I think they might have chosen a malt with a bit more character; it&#8217;s there, it&#8217;s sweet, but that&#8217;s about that. The finish is surprisingly clean, especially given the 100 IBUs, and the alcohol, while obvious and a bit hot, is blended well with the flavors. So, so close, but not quite that eye-popping, life-changing flavor you dream of.  Drinkability: It depends upon what you mean. Would I drink another? In a heartbeat. Could I drink another? God no. After a hard day on the bike and 22 ounces of this, I almost fell on my face when I stood up. Terrific flavor, but way too big to session.  This is certainly one of the America&#8217;s premiere IPAs, simply outstanding. However, it&#8217;s not quite perfect. A bit more malt character/balance, and this bad boy will be unstoppable. Highly recommended.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BeerResearcher,4.59,"This potent, multi-directional brew pours a hazy honey amber color with a thin off-white head and some patchy lace. The big aroma is undeniably floral and piney hops. A light sweet malty smell emerges as does a bit of chopped fruit and alcohol fuminess. There is a solid sweet malty foundation here, with caramel and buttery dough to notice, but this brew is all about HOPS! White Grapefruit (fresh from the tree), lemon zest, strong pine, oranges and a bit of peppery spice, along with a pungent cannabis bud-like bite awakens and lights up the olfactory senses like no other IPA.

The fruity bitterness of the hops overpower anything else in the beer. That's not a bad thing. Big bold bitter hops. So strong they almost burn. Damn tasty though.

Very fragrant and citrusy, bit of herbal earthiness as well. Taste is awesome. I think I let this one sit just long enough. The hops are not harsh at all, very smooth bitterness, and very complementary of the malts. Pale malt and honey notes, hints of caramel, it is all surrounded and supported by subdued piney-citrusy hops about as perfectly as one could hope. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth, and the beer is very refreshing, and my only complaint is that it could stand to be a bit better carbonated. It's far from flat, but just under what I would subjectively consider perfect. This is definitely on the ""Buy Again"" list.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

But the taste brings about much more complexity and shear brillance. Many different hops. The hops start out floral then become bitter then almost a crispy, citric hoppiness finishes. Malt is weak but is definitely needed. The malts seem earthy and provide some sort of base. The alcohol is not noticeable at all, I don't know how considering its strength.

A substantial sticky white head formed, with excellent lacing left behind.  The smell....Wow! It was loaded with an up-front fresh complex of hop notes. The most prominent was of raw unadulterated hop resin (amazing), with strong strawberry and other fruit esters, and citrus-rinds. This is masterful!  The taste was equally well done. The hoppy bitterness danced on the palate, melded with the aromas perfectly, and sent me into hop nirvana. Malt characteristics were just right..subtle. Extremely powerful but never harsh, the beer has a deft touch.  The mouthfeel was full, smooth and satisfying...and complimented the above aromas and flavor. The drinkablity was very good considering the power contained within this high IBU brew. Overall...a simply fantastic high IBU complex IPA that is a must try for any hop lover.

147,4083,nomad,3.82,"In my tulip glass this beer glows with a slightly hazed orange color. On top is a tough and thick foam head, spreading decently thin and spotty lace and stain.  Smells of sweet malt, tickling pine, spicy spruce, big scents of melon rind, and that signature peppery Stone hop presence. A straightforward display to my nose. Taste is spicy with alcohol-burning honey tones and a highly spruce/pine dryness. A definitively textured hop profile, the bitterness is a pure high-alpha sort, chalky dry but juicy at the same time because of the latent acidity. Malt comes through with warmth - its not pale, not caramel, but tasty and interesting. Thinnish mouthfeel.  Very drinkable on purely interesting craftmanship, but still one of the best tasting enormously hoppy and bitter beers I've found.

Aroma: Big, bad, gorgeous hoppiness, fruit aplenty, some grapefruit, yeah, but peach, orange, tangerine, non-stop, glorious hops...so sweet, so utterly pleasant, abundantly delightful. Bright, luscious, lively...all bow in honor of the almightiness of humulus lupus! Shall we sip? Do we dare? Full force of hops on the palate, a devastating wave of hops across the palate up, over, around, about, and above the senses! Dominant to say the least, absolutely overpowering and spreading nothing but delight to those of us hopheads who revel in the luxury of an immersion of such bitter, tasty delights! Each time you put down the glass, and finish your gulp, the flavor subsides on the palate, resides fully in the senses, and you eye that glass and are eager for more. You don't need it, for the flavor has never left your senses, but it tempts, it teases....like the label says, it ruins you for anything of weaker flavor, and why would you ever want that, anyway? Fantastically delicious, this super-hopped ale, one I'd return to as often as I could, when fortune provides. This is the IPA that should be the emblem, the acme, the standard any IPA should strive for!

But I do enjoy it from time to time, because Stone brews excellent quality beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,rkhaze,4.6,"Poured a light orange/honey color. Nice thick foamy off white head that left great sticky lace. Nice big fresh hops upfront in the nose. Citrusy and piney. Sweet malty aromas help to even it out. Big malt flavor. Lightly sweet and fruity with those citrusy, resinous hops riding shotgun. Spicy, slightly floral hop bitterness that really lingered on the tastebuds. Thick, full, round and creamy mouthfeel. Great drinkability for this hop monster. Another quality Stone brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,filabrazilia,4.42,"Pours a clear pale gold with a nice head of white. The lacing drapes the glass in sheets.  Aroma - Floral hops dominate the nose. The sweet malts and hops invite you to drink. I really enjoyed the aroma of this beer.  Taste - Abundant hop flavors assault the senses but are muted by the subtle presence of malt. Its hoppy, but not too hoppy.  Mouthfeel - The tongue is enveloped in hoppy comfort. Delightful hops bite the tongue from beginning to end. I would have liked it to be a bit fuller.  Drinkability - Thoroughly drinkable. An absolute delight to drink.  This is a good beer and I can understand why it is in the top 50.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Boilermaker88,4.42,"Okay, Ill admit it: Ive been intimidated by this beer for quite a while. Its reputation as a monstrously hopped über-IPA has kept me from trying it until now. Released from its 22oz bomber, Ruination had a clear burnished copper color, slow-moving carbonation, and a bubbly jaundiced head that deposited sticky gobs of lace on the glass walls. The aromas of grapefruit rind and pine sap were by far the dominate fragrance. However, a noticeable sweet malt scent was there to keep things from going completely off the rails. The taste was initially of caramel malt before it was trampled by a tidal wave of hops. A juicy, resinous grapefruit rind flavor coated the tongue, morphing into a more pronounced pine taste that left my tongue with a vaguely numb feeling. A light alcohol bite hit the back of the throat, leaving a soft warmth in the chest. Ruination had a full, creamy, and ends up dry. I havent had an IPA yet that left my tongue wondering what the hell happened the way Ruination did. It is quite easy to drink although after one Ruination, you wont be able to taste any other beer. After that, I was done for the night as my palate went into meltdown. The resulting hops burps almost killed my dog, who got too close once. Ruination is one of the biggest, baddest, hugely hopped IPAs around. If you want to challenge your tongue, go no farther than Ruination.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,AtLagerHeads,4.05,"A very solid IPA that is of the American over-hopped persuasion. The beautiful clear amber body has more than a little red hue to it. The small (one finger) ivory head is nicely packed, but dwindles to a film rather quickly. The lacing is spotty but seems to follow down the glass.  A nice malt nose with some caramel-like hints is in the fore while citrus hops lurk in the background. The taste is grapefruit with some nice malt back, rather the reverse of the nose. Quite puckering and bitter, the hops really let you know of their dominance. This lingers long on the back of the tongue, almost to a fault. This beer impresses me as needing to be accompanied by a fine dish of food, probably a fish or pasta dish would be perfect. The flavor by itself is too much for the palate by itself, thus the ""ruination"" factor.  The feel is great with a nice creamy body that finishes with a crisp departure. Drinkable in some quantity when mated up to a good main course.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,CBFanWish,3.47,"A light, almost straw colored IPA by Stone with little head. The smell wss very fruity, almost citrusy. The taste was very fruity, yet semi bitter. It had a very hoppy taste as well. This was not as good as Arrogant Bastard. I found it to be somewhat unballanced. Too hoppy for my taste. I'm a big fan of IPA's, but this one doesn't do it for me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BitteBier,4.37,"Hazy peach color with an average amount of off-white head that laces quite nicely. I expected the nose to be a full-on dose of hops alone, but the malts were surprisingly evident as well. Sweet, flowery hoppiness abounds with a hint of what I liken most to molasses-like malts. It took me a few minutes to adjust to the taste, but I grew to really like this one a lot. Hops ebb and flow throughout as they dance quite gracefully with the base malts. An anise-like spice flavor amidst the citrus and floral tastes. The mouthfeel was quite remarkable--neither clingy nor astringent. This beer is not a mere novelty, as I feared it could be; it's a keeper.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,GreenWBush,4.49,"Ruination IPA - a beer so feared by all of my friends that they won't even taste it. The smell is enough for them.  When you crack the Ruination IPA, you are actually startled by the hops. You assume something must have gone horribly wrong. Something has gone horribly right.  The beer pours out a decent gold-velvet with a nice bleached head. There is lacing, albeit a slight one, that appears after the fluffy head quicky dies away.  For most palates, this beer is devastatingly hoppy and bitter. To be quite honest, I think the Ruination is not all that bitter. It does have a very nice hoppy character, but its 100+ IBU are not what you would expect. Seems to me that SN Celebration is much more harsh in terms of bitterness.  This beer is sweetly malted and has a lovely mouthfeel. It goes down quite well with seafood, one of my favorite pairings. The sad part about this beer is when I first tried it, I thought it was the best hoppy beer there was. I still love it, but it just doesn't even seem that hoppy anymore. Maybe its time at the liquor store (could be as long as 6 months) has really mellowed out the hops and created a more well-balanced beer.  Altogether wonderful, but not one of the hoppiest beers around. This beer could win an award for the hops-belch alone.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Gavage,4.45,"Pours a lovely deep dark gold color with a thick creamy white head. The aroma is incredible - hops, hops, and more hops. A bit of tartness was also detected by the nose, but maybe my nose went haywire from the hops.  The flavor followed what was sensed by the nose. Huge hops flavor that did not offend as the malt level were just right to balance the hop overload. Some sweetness and fruitiness were also detected. Slight crispness on the tongue.The bitterness lasts long (I mean long) on the tongue after swallowing. This is a slow sippin' IPA and the alcohol is barely noticable. I could have had another bottle after this was emptied, so drinkability is very good.  Not to drink with any food, as I had a shrimp cocktail as my glass was almost done and it was tasteless. My tongue was still in shock. Great beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Stubbie1,4.92,"This is one wonderful brew!  It pours a deep golden color, the color of apple juice. On top is a thick white head. The head stays for quite some time and gives away to a thick and sticky lace that lasts to the bottom of my glass.  The aroma reminds me of walking through a pine forest after a strong summers thunderstorm. The smell of fresh pinesap that is running down the side of a tree that just lost some of its branches. Sticky, sweet, and a bit bitter aroma of pine is present through out this brew. There is a slight hint of citrus present, but the pine overrules.  The flavor starts of with a mild hint of malt, but after that, it is hops, nothing more nothing less. You cant even get a hint of the 7.7% that is in this IPA. The feeling is smooth and creamy in the mouth and there is always some movement in my glass. (carbonation) There is a mild but pleasant bitter after taste on the back of your pallet.  Overall: This IPA kicks ass. There is enough going on in this brew to enjoy repeatedly. NO WAY could I get burnt out on drinking this brew. It is easy going down the gullet and enjoyable to sit and sip, or just flat out enjoy. Thank you to all at Stone! You people ROCK!  And thank you Eyechartbrew for bring this from West coast to East coast.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,smitty1080,4.45,"Poured out a cloudy orange with a fluffy white head. I got citrus and pine from the aroma. I detect a bit of hops in this one, yeah right. Once the initial attack of the first sip was over I really got into this beer. As it warmed, in the hour and a half I milked it, I started to understand the enjoyment people get form heavily hopped beers. One hell of a beer.  P.S. I thought hop burps were just a joke. Wrong.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,NickLovesBeer,4.32,"Stone pours a rich golden color with a large white head that reduces after a minute or so. The smell is sweet hops that just seem to jump out at you. The first sip is an attack on your tongue, hops explode in your mouth and seem to numb out all other taste. Despite the initial reaction Ruination is not over powering. It is balanced with a nice amount of malt and even minutes after you can still feel the alcohol esters evaporating off your tongue. Truly delicious.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Ianhockey91,4.45,"Pours out a nice hazy orangish color wiht a fading head that leaves a lot of sticky lace. Hops hops and more hops on the nose, i love the smell of this beer, very spicy. The taste has much more malt then i expected wich is great because it really holds up well to the blast of hops. This is a top notch offering with a nice mouthfeel, wuite chewy and smooth. I could drink it all day.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Ellbert,4.23,Appearance was great. It was a nice rusty orange color with i nice offwhite head that faded to a beautiful lace that crawled up the glass.  Smell: A mild sweet malt flavor with spicy hints of different hops. A small floral smell and a little bit of alcohol.  Taste: Much more malty than I expected. A lot of sweet malt at the begining with plenty of spicy hop flavors and alcohol that come slow and explode at the end. Leaves a bitter and sweet flavor.  Mouthfeel: A nice consitency with plenty of carbonation. Leaves mouth a little dry.  Overall a good beer. Drinkable and delicious.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,skar,4.28,"On tap at Blind Tiger, NYC 10/8/03 Night of the Imperials Part 2  Appearance/Head: A surprisingly light orange color. Slightly cloudy.  Aroma: Massive resin and hops. It reminds me of a brew kettle after you throw in a large dose of hops. There is an interesting complexity to the aroma of this beer, but the strength of the hops makes it difficult to discern specific smells.  Flavor: It starts with moderate malty character, that quickly makes way for an extreme hop flavor that has a long finish. The beer is slightly sweet with a big, full body. The massive hop attack gives it a concentrated character that makes it seem like the beer is higher than 7.7 abv. It really takes over the tongue.  Bottom line: Another interesting, powerful brew from Stone. A real treat. Despite the intense flavors, the beer retains its drinkability. I would love to get a chance to have this again.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,winomark,4.57,"Appearance: Pours a deep gold with a beautiful off-white head.  Aroma: Hop citrus and spiciness can be smelt from across the room! Sweet malt and alcohol give depth.  Taste: Massive hop bitterness, yet good malt balance. The finish is all hops.  Mouthfeel: Dry, crisp and hoppy mouthfeel. Good malt and alcohol lend some balance, but hops dominate. A hop lover's dream!  Drinkability: One of my top 5 beers ever. Tons of hops, but still balanced. Stone = Good.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ColForbin,4.74,"This beer pours a dark golden color with a 1cm head into a pint glass with some beer to spare in the 22oz painted bottle. Without even really trying, all I smell is hops. Citrusy, piney resinous hops. In fact, if I take too deep of a breath, I can feel an itch on my soft pallet the aroma is so strong. The taste is more of the same - hops, hops and more hops. You can feel the hop oils trickling down your throat - don't believe anyone who says this beer is balanced. It has enough malt to have a good, heavy mouthfeel (and high ABV), but I'll be damned if I can taste any of it. Probably the hoppiest beer I've ever had or will have.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,wgunders,4.35,"Poored from the bottle with a nice golden amber color and a nice off white head that stays for the duration. Wonderful floral, cirtus, and a pine smells accompany this beer. I expected this beer to have more of a bitter taste, instead it is very smooth with a just little bit of a bite to it. The bitterness becomes more apparent upon warming, but is still very smooth. Ruination IPA is quickly becoming one of my favorites.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Admiraldinty,4.08,"Pours a golden amber with a cappuccino-like white head that leaves a beautiful white lace down the side of the glass. Aroma is fairly medicinal, and obviously quite hoppy. Also, there is some citrus going on. There's also some pine and a touch of malt. Taste is absolutely hoppy. Starts out floral. The name of the beer is ""Ruination"" because it ruins your tastebuds after the first few sips. This is dead on. Eventually this goes to malt, and finally it ends earthy. Medium-bodied. Fairly creamy mouthfeel - not at all what I was expecting. This is a tasty beer, but doesn't seem much different that Stone IPA. For a hoppy beer I prefer Hop Devil.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,byrd,4.4,"Ruination pours beautifully golden orange with an off white (slightly orange) frothy head that has nice staying power. Theres a slight haze. The lace is sticky and holds onto the sides of the glass. The nose is citric (orange and grapefruit) and a little sweet. The body is slick and somewhat thick. Theres a smooth, sweet start that has a little caramel malt up front. Not for too long though... The hop bite quickly kicks in and continues for the rest of the ride. The citric notes from the nose are very evident in the palate. Theres a juiciness to this brew and a long bitter aftertaste in the back of the mouth. Although there are tons of hops here, they never seen to be over the top like other highly hoped brews Ive had. The malt base, that is most noticeable in the start, remains in the background the entire time and balances the beer quite nicely giving it a very smooth character. The alcohol never seems to be noticeable, yet it can be felt by the end of the bottle. As the beer warms, the malt undertones become more prevalent, but the hops never subside.  I really enjoyed this brew. I was continually impressed at how smooth this brew was despite all the hops. I was incredibly drinkable, and while I probably couldnt drink too many of these (simply because I wouldnt be able to walk to the fridge after more then a couple) it sure would be enjoyable to try my best.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,rabidawg,4.82,"Appearance: Golden-copper with a soft, creamy white head with large bubbles stuck in it at random. Sticky, grabbing lacing. Minimal, but adequate, carbonation.  Smell: Like every IPA you've ever had, all rolled into one. WIth some fresh whole leaf hops thrown into the mix. Loads of spicy citrus, with lemon zest, definite juicy orange, a pine needle blast, and a softer backbone of rich malt.  Taste: I don't mean to sound cocky, but I expected more bitterness. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty to go around, but I just expected more. So much more balanced than I expected, with so much fresh citrus flavor I feel like I've just bitten into a slightly under-ripe orange, peel and all. I've never had a beer this juicy. It reminds me of a much more intense SN Celebration. A slight earthy, funky flavor jumps into the mix for a second, only to be beaten down by more orange-citrus flavor. I can feel my mouth watering as I drink this. Excellent, excellent beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Eyedrinkale,4.72,"Greg, If you're reading this, PUT THIS ON NITRO & DISTRUBUTE IT EVERYWHERE. This is gonna be bigger than Arrogant Bastard.  This ale is just awesome.

147,4083,tavernjef,4.75,"Loved everything about this bad boy! Wow, what a fantastic looking glass full of necture if I ever saw one! Super clouded and deeply paled yellow with a golden orangey brown tone, head is small, compactedly thick and frothy, lace starts in huge thin sheets eventually breaking into spots and a thin haze on top always present.  Smell is a wonderfully complex hop nose, sweet soft pine, honey, flowers, light sour citrusy fruits of mango and lime, backing of caramel malt is nice along with a touch of alcoholic warmth. The pine is so intreging, lots of needles of nearly every kind, cedar, spruce, and Norway/Red. Yummy, super awesome nose!  Taste is lovely with a terrific hop bitterness lending solid pine fragments of needles, resin, and sap; fresh, a bit of dried sense and herbal calming, not over the top all that much but the presense is strong and balanced quite nicely with a caramel/toffeeish candied malts. Hops are so smooth on the palette in this its amazing. Quite a nice surprise.  Feel is very smooth and warm, medium to nearly a full peak at the midaway point, some creamyness and the hops linger with easy pine and slight spiced factions with some caramel chewyness. One easy drinkin' IPA, goes down smooth with solid hop character with a considerable malt backing. 7.7 ABV? Really? Wow, that doesn't show in any of the taste, sure, a bit in the aroma, but does begin to take over alot in the noggin once you've got through some of the bomber. And out of the etched labeling that Stone Brewing has on its bottles, this one is the coolest. Something about the color choice and the pose of the Gargoyle strikes me.  Yum! Thanks to Gusler for the bottle - I need more!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,sponberg,4.42,"Now how the hell am I supposed to follow THAT up?  Pours deep gold with little head and a resinous, syrupy citric-pine hoppiness that slugs you in the nose.  Yes, there is a degree of maltiness, slightly caramel-toffeeish with some toastiness, but then the hops take over. And they just do NOT stop. It just keeps getting hoppier and more bitter. When you think the citrus rind and pinesap attack is about to end, more arrives. It's like someone has their foot on the hop accelerator so hard that the pedal bracket bends. yet, for all that, it's a friendly IPA - very accessible if you like it's style of hoppiness, because the octane balances the hops.  If beer were Nascar, this would be the Jimmy Spencer of big-ass IPAs. Mr. Excitement, baby.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,cokes,4.57,"Toasty, clear golden bodied. Leaning towards amber once all is said and done. Limited tan foam atop. Pine nose. All piney all the time. Strong and inviting with just smidgens of toasty, buttery caramel bread below. If hops are what you are after, than this is what you seek. I'll do away the malt promptly in this review, with just a biscuity, buttery, caramel apple heft. Yeah, it sure is worthwhile on its own. But this is for the hopheads. And it delivers in spades. Crashes into the throat like a drunken, joint-toting Santa into a Christmas tree. Sappy branches, cashed bowls and resin-drenched ornaments scattered everywhere. Piney. Let me make that clear: PINE!!! Are you listening? This is fucking PINEY!! Conifers, but in liquid form. If I wanted to offer a objective critique, this may be overly one-note in its hopping. But it offers enough so as not to make a difference. Malt heft is understated, but everpresent. Above medium heft,with limited carbonation, but so long as you crave the cones, this is scary drinkable.  Hopheads, repeat after me: ""Say hello to my little friend."" The cult status is utmostly deserved here.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,beerguy101,4.36,"Medium gold color, medium head. Aroma is grapefruity, citrusy and a whole lot of hoppyness. WOW. This is the ultimate BIG BOLD IPA. Complex flavors. The big fruit maltyness is balanced by the incredible hoppyness. A beer of extraordinary contrasts. Smooth taste is balanced by a big sharp hop bite. The taste is malty and fruity and sweet and bitter and sharp while at the same time its not. Definitely worthy of the hype. Amazingly well made beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is smooth and dry. Aftertaste is bitter. Etched/painted beer bottle.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

147,4083,Gueuzedude,4.22,"An orangey gold color, quite a bit of haze is present in this beer. Pours with a decently thick cream colored head. Smells of hay, a field of grass with some sort of spicy blooming flowers, slightly lemony. There is a solid mouth feel presence, it coats the front of the mouth. Of course it is quite bitter, but in no way is it out of balance, quite remarkable for that in fact. The hop flavor is crawling out of this beer all over the place. The bitterness stays with you after one swallows. A complex floral, orangey (though only slightly), apricot (but just a hint) mix of flavors. It is like sucking the nectar from an aromatic-fruity, but not particularly sweet, flower on some unspecified aromatic herb (of course this would be a hop). Effectively saturates one's taste buds as the bottle has promised. I am still struck by the fact that, though this is utterly bitter and hoppy, it is not perceived to be too over the top. There is a solid malt backbone that, though effectively hidden by the hop attack, is what makes this beer possible, it is what brings this beer to the next level.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Sweet aroma of hops and honey and butterscotch candy. Mouthfeel is smooth. Flavor is big juicy hop bitters right upfront. Grapefruit rind and piney notes, just a bit of sweetness from the malt riding beneath, as well as some honey and butterscotch, but it barely peeks out.

147,4083,beergeek279,4.82,"Served in the 22 oz bomber. The color was golden, with an excellent white head. The smell was a great hop. The taste was simply fantastic...at over 100 IBUs, hop bitterness was certainly not lacking, but remarkably was well-balanced so that it wasn't just hop juice. Mouthfeel was quite smooth. Drinkability-wise, could have these all night!  Wow! If there was an Imperial IPA category on BA, then the Ruination would certainly be at the top of the field! There's plenty of delicious hop bitterness to be had, but unlike most high IBUs, this is beer, and not simply hops for hops sake! A fantastic beer, and certainly one I will have again!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Winter,4.48,"Pours amber in color with an off-white creamy head. Thick soapy lacing clings to the side of the glass. Hoppy aroma consists of citrus, pine and a hint of biscuit. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Thick juicy hop flavors burst onto the palate. Primary flavors of grapefruit and pine dominate the front initially. Then the bitterness rushes forward. Some malt flavor emerges from the back, but not enough to steal the show from the hops, which is what this beer is all about. The finish is bitter and a little on the dry side, but not so bitter that it makes you want to keep sipping to quench it. A salty, citrusy flavor lingers in the finish.  Ruination is a big I.P.A. Fans of the style will adore this beer. The 7.7% abv is handled and delivered nicely. You really don't notice it in the taste, but eventually it sneaks up on you. A little one dimensional? I don't think so, Ruination fails to disappoint.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ManekiNeko,3.67,"Poured cold in to a pub glass.  Appearance: Hazy light orange with a cream colored head. Head composed of frothy bubbles, rose to about 3/4"" before settling. Left a pleasant bit of lacing down as glass as the beer was consumed.  Aroma: The smell of piney hops is über pungent with a twinge of citrus and floral undertones.  Taste: Hop! Hop! Hop! This stuff has more hops than a coney of rabbits. Veiled flavor of pale malt. Hoppy aftertaste that lingers like your weird uncle at a family gathering, which is good if you like that uncle.  Mouthfeel: Very bracing. The high IBU's make so that you're still tasting this an hour later.  Drinkability: This all hinges on whether or not you are a hophead. If you are, this is right up your alley. If not, I'd recommend you find a friend (hopefully a fellow BA) with an adventuresome palate. Certainly worth the experience.

147,4083,RoyalT,5,"Appearance  The Ruination pours a gorgeous orange color with a terrific head that laced the heck out of my Ruination (what else?) glass on a modest pour. This one is thick through and through. I could stare at this all night if I didnt want to drink it so bad.  Smell  This one has a big, complex hop profile. I can pick up everything from nice floral notes to big citrus to very smooth pine resin. Theres also a good malty sweetness that gives this Double IPA an incredibly full bouquet. Its balanced but assertive in its style. The aroma announces the above-standard qualities of this ale.  Taste  This is very distinctive. Its big and complex with a huge hop flavor that screams, quality ingredients, mixed reasonably with some very attractive malts and a good caramel sweetness for balance. It is perfectly executed for the style and demands attention by the thoughtful beer drinker.  This is like a full course meal with different flavors all around but that satisfies in the end. The hops are very floral and mixed with a pinch of table sugar and a six-inch grapefruit wedge. You can learn a lot from this beer.  Mouthfeel  Theres just enough carbonation to make this one entertaining. It is full in the mouth and incredibly smooth. Its thick and chewy just like an American Double IPA should be.  Drinkability  My body loves this as it does oxygen. This brew is awesome. You dont want to drink it with any food because its so filling and so flavorful.  Update  This is a staple in my house, so I thought that Id re-review it with a batch from 2004. Is it still a perfect 5? Even after a bottle or two a week of this stuff its still perfect and I still havent found a better IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

This is a good representation of the IPA class and if you're a hop head, this one is for you.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,freed,4.12,"Deep straw coloring, nice white head. Bold aroma of fresh cut greens, somewhat sour. Taste is suggestively malty, but main thrust is hops. Fresh hop, well, taste isn't the word. Assertion. Deep bitterness too, just in case you forgot. Last taste leaves you wanting something to quell the tart.  Managed to have some of this on tap at OBF. It was still impressively hoppy, and the aroma was very grassy, but it was probably better in the bottle.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,hopjack13,4.82,"the aroma comes thorough before you even get to see the apperance, HOPS!! BIG TIME! lots of them . not a real thick white head , but substancial. oh and the smell of those wonderful hops! the first taste is an onrush of fresh floral hops, all the way through. then it finishes with overtones of carmel malts. nicely balanced considering the magnitude of the hops. very good mouthfeel, carbonation is there but not too much to where you have to fight with it. a very wonderful , beautiful beer. truely ""a liquid poem to the glory of the hop""",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ADR,4.37,"Clear deep orange-gold appearance, skimish 1/8 of an inch head. Dripping ring laces. A steeped hop aroma, pithy and almost lurking in its promise to showcase IBUs. Medium carbonation to the tongue. Yes, lots of hoppiness, well done and becoming apparent early -- nice and juicy in character. The malt balances adequately but not with more than a slight honeyish backbone. Hops rule here, but are fresh and vibrant. A more natural presence than a simmering Dogfish 90 Minute IPA. A definite take on an American IPA...  Source: Liquid Solutions",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,frank4sail,4.41,"Fresh hop flowers in the nose as well as the smell of citrus candy sweetness(malty). Lots of little bubbles and carbonation in the hazy orange nectar. A thick creamy, fluffy, white head stays stiff and persistant in the glass. Initial intense sweetish orange flavor followed quickly by sharp bitter chewy orange skin/rind taste. It is unyielding in its citrus bitterness thereafter. A slightly sweet tip of the tongue is left in the finish as well as dry bitterness on the back of the tongue. Medium mouthfeel with some smooth silkyness on the palate. Lovingly brutal to the tongue. Very good ... and not for the timid. I am cellaring a few to see how it mellows.... yea right.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,alexgash,4.6,"After trying a small sample at AOBF, I finally cracked open the this 22oz. monster that I smuggled into Utah. Poured a bubbly copper with a big spritzy white head. Smell was nice and hoppy, but not overly so--it smelled like a good regular IPA does--only with a little more alcohol fumes present. Taste? WOW. Just as I remembered. Initially slight malts fighting hopelessly against an increasing hoppiness. As it goes down, the bitterness reaches maximum threshold levels and stays around whether you like it or not. Even though the bitter hops are unbelievably over-the-top, this brew is balanced enough to easily let me finish all 22 hop-bursting ounces. Mouthfeel is great--just right. I don't think I would drink this regularly, but it's amazing enough to keep me coming back (when I can get it).",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Rumrunner,4.06,"22oz. bottle. HOPPPPPY HEAVEN. Did they put malt in this IPA?  The pour produced very little foam. Not much of a head. The color is a transparent gold but not light. I thought of a gold bar when I was looking through the glass.  The ale is hop powerful at the start. The flavors are a nice blend of earthy grapefruit with a toasty quality. I can't describe a flavor for the toast quality. Oh yea, did I mention the hops? The flavors finish with a cream accent and the ale mellows a bit. The high ABV is well hidden in the flavors.  The carbonation is slight. Less than other IPA's I have tried. The IPA has an acidic quality to the mouthfeel.  Over all a great IPA. I will definately purchase more of these. I also think Stone Brewery is coming in to it's own. Their getting more creative, taking chances and their consistency is excellent now. Not the way it was in the past.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,TheDM,3.2,This brew poured a small head of fine to large sized white bubbles and amber orange transparent body. It has a strong hoppy aroma and a strong hoppy flavor to boot. It has an initial hop flavor and a strong hop finish. You can summarize the brew in 1 word! HOPPY. A true hopheads delight.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,RenoZymurgist,3.57,Frothy white head which disipates quickly. Nice strong hop aroma which is full of grapefruit and a nice floral accent. Amber in color with a hint of redness but lighter than other super strong IPAs i have had. Low carbonation but not so low as an English Ale. The low carbonation allowed a hoppier accent to come through without bitterness. The flavor comes on strong and is balanced very well with a clean but notably hoppy finish. Fusel alcohols are present and warms the palate and throat. Excellent IPA that follows in the tradition of big west coast beers,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,JohnnyDuvel,4.07,"Wow, do these guys have more beers than any other brewery in the world? Anyways, I found this IPA to be similar to several of the other American IPA's I've had (particularly the Rogue). Fruity, hoppy, hoppy, and hoppy. I liked the ABV, which is well hidden and provides a nice buzz (literally!). A wonderful smell, a nice fruity taste. Mouthfeel is dry and bitter, and this is certainly a hop-heads' dream. I am not, however, a hophead. I enjoy this kind of beer on occasion, and it is as good as most (I like the Two-Hearted and the Alesmith more), but if you're into this style, seek it out. It will definitely deliver.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Mitchster,3.68,"Slightly hazy orange with caramel accents forms a nice 2-finger head of light beige atop small to medium-sized bubbles. The head is meringue in consistency with very good retention and lacing. Carbonation is mild to moderate. Aroma is very floral, fresh green hops with a complex, pleasant, and fresh aromatic quality to them. There is a brief glimpse of some toasty caramunich notes if you close your eyes and concentrate really hard. Everything else that may be there is completely overpowered by the hops. Mouthfeel is smooth with a wet finish and moderate acidity. Taste begins suprisingly with smooth malts, then acrid, pungent floral flavor hops..a wave of peppery drying alcohol assaults the mouth, followed by a toasty, then raisiny malt note appears towards the end. The finish is of potent, unbalanced herbal bitterness. Again, this is another intense brew from Stone, but completely out of balance which severely inhibits drinkability. This is a decent brew, but in my opinion, it is way overrated. A ton of hops does not a good beer make.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BeerManDan,4.35,"When poured, it produced an yellow/orange hue with a little foam and nice lace. The smell of malt's compined with the hops gave a very pleasant aroma. The taste was like I was drinking a mild Barley Wine Beer. The sweet/bitterness was well balance while drinking in the mouth and palate. The bitterness is not overpowering, just nice a suttle. Rated right up there with Stone's great beers!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,elmocoso,4.29,A nice tarnished gold with a slight haze. A slight blanket of hate and a nice collar with pretty decent lacing.  The nose is a candied hop smell. Malty sweetness and a fruitiness.  The first drink is an eye opener. Sweet and floral than the full bitterness makes itself known to the whole mouth - sweet pucker of love. I got a good whiff alcohol shoved into my nose when i swallowed. it felt good and warming.  this is a very full bodied beer.  keep drinking it to stay ahead of the hops!,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,DrewBeechum,4.52,Judged at the 2003 Lucky Baldwin's IPA Festival (Blind Tasting) (Reviewed as a Double IPA)  Beer pours with a deep rocky head with a deep orange agate color and a brilliant clarity (Shocking in a beer this incredibly hoppy)  Aroma is a mixture of alcohol and American hops like Tomahawk and the big C's  Initial flavor is a big brazen hop zing that eventually allows a long caramel malt to temper the finish.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,quidquam,4.88,"Awesome. This is my favorite bottled beer. I've bought a few 1L 16oz bottles, and enjoyed them all. From dark green bottle with the very nice design, to the smooth thick IPA mouth feel it provides, I love it all. If I had to make a complaint (and I do), it would be that the aroma doesn't quite stand out enough. I have had other IPAs on tap that had a thicker hopp smell.  The bottle says, ""A liquid poem to the glory of the hopp"" and it's no exaggeration. This beer is one of the hoppiest IPAs I've ever had, but it's very good stuff. I buy some nearly every time I buy beer now. I'm in southern california, so I might have to figure out an excuse to travel down to San Marcos!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Bierguy5,4.22,"This beer poured a nice copper color, with a large white head. The smell is simple, HOPS! Very flowery, hoppy smell. The taste is a great flowery/citrusy hop flavor with just a touch of malt to bring you back to reality. The lace left in the glass is wonderful, although I tried to get every drop that I could. This beer packs a punch, not as much as DFH 90 or Dreadnaught. I enjoy that the alcohol presence is not as severe as the two I just mentioned. Don't mistake however, 1 bomber of Ruination is enough for a work night. This is yet another great beer by Stone, which is easily available, and average in price. This is an excellent IPA that I will revisit often. Thank you Stone!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,francisweizen,4.65,"Another excellent IPA from Stone Brewing. This beer poured a nice peach-y colour with a creamy, white head. The aromas are of fresh hops, nice malts, and citrus fruits. The taste? more of the same. A hoppy delight with enough citrus to give the grape-fruit lover his or her daily allowance. The mouthfeel of this beer is never too thick and the drinkaility is excellent!  Another winner from Stone! Cheers to EyeChartBrew! -F",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Naerhu,4.07,Beautiful orange and yellow semi-opaque body. White head with amazing lacing. A whole bouquet of fresh cut wild flowers on a medium soft malted barley aroma. Shocking bitterness. A tornado of hops screams across my palate. Is this beer or hop juice. Amazing. Medium body. The bitterness is exiciting but it is also vicious. This beer is more of an art piece than a daily pleasure.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,SheepNutz,4.37,"I felt the ruination in a 22oz. bomber poured into a pint glass. It pours a deep amber/copper color that is slightly cloudy. There is 1.5 fingers of foam that die down fairly quickly. There is a little lace left on the glass. The smell seems to be a little citrus and a lot of hops. I've never smelled anything like this. The taste packs one hell of a hops punch! The amount of hops overwhelmes two-hearted by far. You do get a bit of a piney-fruit mix in with the hops. The mouthfeel is excellent. Drinkability is fairly good. To sum it up, this is my king of hops, at least until I try my dogfish 60 and 90 minute IPAs in the fridge.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,marburg,4.02,"A bit more clear than I expected, this brew poured an almost-amber orange-ish color with a small off-white head that dissipated fairly quickly. Fortunately, the aroma was quite powerful anyhow.  And that's really the highlight of this brew for me. The stupendous hop aroma is absolutely overwhelming. Aromas of citrus fruit, pine needles, pineapple, and spring flowers don't tickle the olefactory senses -- they give your nose a shiatsu massage.  The taste seemed, to me, a bit more one-dimensional -- overwhelmingly bitter. A slight fruit taste that was quickly enveloped by a strong hop bitterness that permeated every nook and cranny of the back of my mouth. I'm left with a very cottony feel in my mouth -- doughy, dry, and lingering. It's not entirely pleasant, actually. But it's interesting.  This beer is definitely potent. I was a little scared, honestly, by the threats of utter palate annhilation. I was pleasantly surprised to find that, while this beer really nails your tongue to the wall, it isn't so overwhelmingly hoppy that it's exclusively for the biggest of hop-heads. Quite good and limited in its drinkability only by it's high alcohol content and intense mouthfeel.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,powoo19,3.08,"The beer poured a nice dark caramel color witha nice head. The smell was a strong hop/fruit and other smells I couldnt put my finger on..It is a very busy beer.

147,4083,jcalabre,4.62,"Originally tasted 19 June 2002. The beer gods smiled down and said, ""Let there be HOPS"". WOW. This is a hop lover's delight. This beer, in my humble opinion, defines the ""Imperial India Pale Ale"" style, the new & fashionable, super hopped IPA style we've been seeing a lot more of. I prefer to call it, ""Über IPA""",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Jon,4.82,"What do you know? Stone captures my taste buds once again. This big IPA pours a deep copper color with a sizeable off-white head that lasts and lasts. Nose is big on citrusy hops. Notes of grapefruit, citrus rind, and pine proliferate. Taste, as expected, is big on the hops, although I would not say this IPA had a ""ruinous"" effect on my palate. At over 100 IBUs, this was just right for my tastes! Mouthfeel was appropriately carbonated, and for an IPA of its size, it drinks very easily. An excellent IPA worth all the acclaim.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,ecoboy,4.59,"My girlfriend's father, who is a brewer, took one sip and expressed in wonderment, ""how do they get all those flavors in there?"" Exactly.  The hops may hit you with the strength of chinese mustard or wasabi, but it's the fruit, caramel and malt notes beyond the brilliant grassy and flowery bitterness that make this beer worth staring at. Off-white head with great lacing above a remarkably cloudy apricot color that is unique in my experience with IPA's.  Substantial alcohol warmth; really surprising how the malt characteristics do not ever give up the fight. Enjoyed with some Manchego and some Scottish whiskey cheddar. Really top notch: not sold in Northern New England, this is the ""good stuff"" to be cellared and only brought out for special occassions for me.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,cretemixer,4.23,"Reddish amber in color with a voluminous frothy off-white head. It slowly fades, leaving a thick clingy lace. Pine forest hoppy aroma with a ever so slight bready undertone. Sharp hop taste. Pleasantly bitter ( but I love da hops, what can I say ) An alcohol warmth and a slight maltiness meld with the floral hoppiness to hint that there may be some sense of balance here, but it just isn't going to happen. Finishes with a saltly note. A definite hop monster. Resinous mouthfeel, full body, and light carbonation. I like this beer, but it's not love. Just too one sided for me, but of course it claims to be just that. ""A liquid poem to the glory of the hop"" is what it says on the bottle. That it is.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,dwarbi,4.53,"Pours with almost no head, but had excellent lacing. The color is just about orange. There's a reddish tint, too. Smells and tastes stongly of hops (of course). Superb taste. Almost perfect. Very close to being exactly what I think an IPA should be. It's very crisp and had a clean finish. One of the most pleasant on the palate and drinkable beers that I have reviewed.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,BierReise,4,Nice clear amber body with a big foamy head. Nice thick retention all the way down the glass. Aroma is big and citrusy with a biscuity yeast and malt quality. Medium bodied and a bit chewy. has a stinging numbing bitterness from huge amount of hops. Slightly sweet but oh so bitter. Really nice big IPA.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,irishmoss,4.85,"The first thing that struck me when I poured this amber-bronze, IPA was the remarkable clarity, not a trace of cloudiness. A nice full head left scattered rings of lace as I enjoyed the brew. I must say that this was very well carbonated, constant tiny bubbles throughout entire glass of beer. Enough about the appearance, because I quickly forgot about it as soon as I caught a whiff of the aroma. It was a combination of citrus and clove, and it was wonderful. I found myself sniffing all the way down to the last drop and then took a couple more from an empty glass. Bitter is a word that I would never use to describe the taste. It was well hopped, but by no means over hopped. Along the burst of hops, it also tasted like it smelled, citrus & clove was an undertone to the flavor. A couple of swallows had a slight alcohol flavor, but that had no effect on my overall enjoyment. Besides, who the hell doesn't enjoy the flavor of alcohol.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,RBorsato,3.78,"Hazy golden bronze with a full light beige/tan head. More balanced aroma than the standard Stone IPA but mostly plain old bitterness. Big malty flavor with a huge hop bitterness to balance; Sierra Nevada Bigfoot-ish (an American Barleywine). Full bodied and creamy but quite possibly too big ... if that's possible.  Much prefer Stone's Standard IPA over this one for an IPA - I'd buy this one only when I'm in the mood for a Barleywine.  Label states ""100+ IBU's""  (22 oz. bottle / $5.49)",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Dmann,4.87,"Can Stone do no wrong?! If you are a hop-head then this beer will knock your socks off! If you are not used to hops, you better get used to them before trying this great brew. It poured a nice copper color with a good sized frothy head that left a nice spider web like lace all around the glass. Right off the bat the smell is of hops, with a hint of pine and citrus. The taste is a rush of hops right off the bat, followed by some citrus flavors, then some alchohol flavors sneak into the nice crisp finish. Personally, I do not find these types of beers ""bitter"" in the traditonal sense of the word, I find them very flavorfull. And this brew is no exception. It kind of reminds me of the Old Guardian Barleywine more than it reminds me of the regular IPA, since the regular IPA seems more harsh than this one. All in all, this is a perfect tribute to the all powerful hop!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,IrishRedRock,4.09,"I was happy to finally get my hands on a 22 oz'er of this one. The bottle is really cool and the rather long essay on the back is another quality piece of work from Stone.  The hops are glorified in every way in this beer. The aroma is dominated by a pungent hop oil, with a bit of pine as well. The taste, as expected, is quite hoppy as well, but not as over the top as I expected it to be. It certainly is not overpowering. Mouthfeel is somewhat oily...it starts off with bubbly citrus flavors, followed by the dominating presence of hops. I for some reason don't think this is the best IPA I have had, but it's damn good, and a great one for hopheads.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,TXHops,4.15,"Talk about a tempting concept! An IPA so hoppy it ruins your palate! This one ranked higher on the intrigue meter than Brutal Bitter  Ruination is a pale, slightly hazy orangey yellow color in the glass, with a just-creamier-than-white head of thick foam. The head lasts long and laces well. A big, juicy aroma of sticky, resiny hops assaults my nostrils, setting the stage for more to come. Unlike Levitation, or most of the highly-hopped Rogue products, or SNCA and Bigfoot, the hoppiness in Ruination isnt harsh and confrontational. Instead, its juicy, sticky and it actually manifests itself in the flavor, more than in the aftertaste. The sweetness of the pale malt mixes sublimely with resiny hop oils creating a sticky sweet hop bath for the mouth. Ruination also has that much-coveted (by me) hop jelly character that I found and loved in DFH 90 Minute IPA, though the 90 Minute captured the essence of hops slightly more than Ruination does. After the addictive, gummy, citric character of the hops recedes and the sweetness of the malt has moved into linger phase, there is a shot of pretty intense bitterness in the tail. Its interesting reallythe beer opens up with a very quick volley of bitterness before it settles into the extraordinary, almost chewy hoppiness that makes the beer so desirous. Then the same bitterness re-emerges briefly at the end, reminding me of the glorious complexity of the hop cone. Like some of the super-strong beers, Ruination actually works better as a sipping beer. Drinking it too quickly really masked the subtlety of the hops and resulted in a more one-dimensional bitterness. However, when taken in smaller, less frequent drinks, the excellence of this beer really shows through.  At the and of the glass, a bit of alcoholic warmth was starting to exert itself somewhat, mixing with the leafiness to create a bit of barleywine character. Interestingly, this beer wasnt too terribly bitter, just hoppy. I found Levitation to be more bitter in the end, though Ruination to be WAY more hoppy.  Great beer and one thats quickly addicted me. Too bad Id have to go back to Tucson for more",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,jeffboo,4.42,"Bam Pow Bash!!! That was my introduction to this outstanding brew. Am I a Batman punching bag in this episode? Anyhow, when you have a need for hops, this one certainly takes care of the fix. A brilliant, slightly cloudy orange color with a puffy white head. AROMA, yes, just like it should be- huge citrus, flowers, grapefruit rind, oranges, probably lemons and limes if I wasn't diving in so fast. This beer has a nice solid body holding in a creamy,milky nectar thats very smooth. The finish is bitter but smooth, maybe a little woody from all the hops. It only lacks a little malt complexity in the flavor, the malt seems a bit basic but does hold up well to the hop explosion. A great hop directed brew.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Dantes,3.97,"Presentation: ~10oz. from draught in a tulip glass at The Blind Tiger&#8217;s Stone 12 event. Served a bit cold. Cost: $5.  Appearance: A beer that shows very nicely in the glass, and probably even lovelier in a Shaker glass. An orange-gold body, capped with a medium-thick ½&#8221; of foam, which resolved gradually to an opaque film. Not appreciably different than the Pale Ale or IPA.  Smell: A strong scent of herb-and-grapefruit, with a stronger touch of the grassiness that made itself known in the cask IPA tasted before this.  Taste: Grabbed a foothold on my tongue like a Marine Force Recon team and percolated up through my sinuses. I could detect some malty-grain flavor elements and some peppery spice, but mostly this delivered hops, hops, and more hops. As it warmed, the beer assumed a somewhat medicinal characteristic, largely composed of a mentholated pine flavor I often begin to feel in these super-hoppy beers. Even a glass of club soda to cool my palate didn&#8217;t help much. The resinous, citrusy hops flavor provides a long-lasting but rather simplistic finish.  Mouthfeel: Nicely carbonated, providing a soothing counterbalance to the over-the-top flavors. Fuller-bodied than the pale ale and IPA, perhaps due to the increased ABV.  Drinkability: Not something I&#8217;m going to opt for frequently when I should now be able to get the IPA on a regular basis. Too strong for a session beer, but not complex or interesting enough to linger over.  This sample followed the somewhat weak Pale Ale and the stupendous casked IPA, which perhaps prejudiced my opinions of this. In the pantheon of deservedly praised Stone offerings, this one lacks the elegance and complexity of most of the others. Possibly because it crossed the threshold of my hops tolerance, I have been overly critical. In any event, I&#8217;ll lean toward the IPA in the future.  Bottom Line: For those of you looking for a Tactical Hop Weapon, this one&#8217;s for you. As Goldilocks said, &#8220;This one is toooo &#8216;hard&#8217;.&#8221;",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,avylover,4.82,"tried other Stone IPAs (or any Stone ale for that matter) so this beer is held to a high standard...and delivers once again. Looks very inviting, hazy golden with a frothy white head and rising bubbles in the bottom of my glass. Smell is sweet & malty, with citrous hops singing my nose hairs. The taste EXPLODES with citrousy hops, all the while hanging on to a strong malt backbone and an inviting alcohol warmth. Lemon jumps out at me, then the sweetness of the malt comes in to fill things out. Nice lingering taste of citrous. I could drink a ton of this..the consequences are worth it! Can these guys make anything other than great beer? Cheers Stone!!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Darkale,4.5,"Another fabulous beer from our benefactors from Stone.  Color is a hazy light orange, with an off-white, thick, small-bubbled head. The head is long-lived, and the lacing is amazing; that lace just does not want to let go.  Aroma is very strongly floral.  The first taste is of malt beneath the stupendous hops. It's a lot of bright, buzzy, cheery sweetness beneath the spicy hops, like a line of cellos with jazzy clarinets on top.  OK, that last image was a bit strained, but I love this beer and you know how guys are when they are in love.  Chewy and creamy, smooth and inviting.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,PhantomVodoo,4.4,"Clear golden in color with an off-white head. Aroma of citrusy hops.  Awesome flavor. Huge hop profile that is very citrusy and a little spicy. Flavor is like an orange, except not nearly that sweet. Smooth malt backbone does it's best to let you know it's there despite the onslaught of hops. With my initial bottle of Ruination I knew I really liked the flavor, but I felt the hop bitterness was a bit much. However, on this sampling the beer went down cleanly and with such ease as I did not notice the beer being overly bitter at all. Future samplings are most certainly called for to solidify my position on this beer.  Good mouthfeel that has a touch of creaminess to it. Drinkability: I'm currently torn on this as noted above. Had to work my way through my first bottle, but a later sampling was gone in a flash with no bitter beer face at all. Overall, a very good IPA with an awesome flavor.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Shiredave,4.6,"My everlasting gratitude to Bill for this gifted bottle. As the label faithfully and accurately states: "" A liquid poem to the Glory of the Hop."" From collectable, screened bottle to tasty, tongue strangling bitter aftertaste hours after drinking, this IPA is a hop lovers Tour de Force - the coup de gras - the Holy Grail - the lead in the pencil - the Wind in the friggin Willows - I go overboard you say? I dont think so. I have almost finished this 22oz. bottle and I am still exploring new flavors exploding in my mouth. The medium + malty body makes its self known at @ 60 deg. F. - dont drink this one too cold please , you will miss so much! Oh yea,... crystal clear, gold amber color, slow trickles of carbonation, dripping strands of lace, inviting yet surprisingly subtle, floral and grassy hop aroma, smooth and oily mouth feel, flavors of warm biscuits, citrus and peppery hop, yadda, yadda, yadda....bottom line is find this beer and drink it! Buy alot of it because you will want more than you will ever have. This stuff is simply awsome. Somehow mantains balance despite outrageous hop rate and flavor. These guys are awfully cocky (and comical) about thier beer ( read a label) but now I know why! They have every reason to be proud. Postscript: After tasting this on draft at the Stone Launch (12, 12@12) at The Blind Tiger, I can honestly say it DOES get better than this! Amazing.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

You know that its going to be really hop (shoot someone warned me about the hoppiness) but man on man its like a party in my mouth and the hops are invited. I did one of those bitter, pucker up faces that I haven't done since the first time I tried beer. But this time it was good. It took a little getting used to but once your palate has become used to the taste its great. The maltiness is typical for an IPA, very light and crisp, but the hops are what really makes this beer.

Lots and lots of bubbles kept flowing upwards in the beer as the glass was emptied. The aroma is that of hops; flowery and sweet. Each sip begins sweet and malty. Hops soon take over and an a fruity (buttery?) flavor finishes off the sip. A sticky residue and alcoholic taste is left behind. Watch out for the alcohol. At 7% abv it sneaks up on you pretty quick!  This is a well balanced beer. The first few sips are all hops, but once your pallett adjusts all the other flavors come out. I was a little disappointed in how quickly the head disappeard and the lack of lace, but the aroma and flavor make up for any visual short comings.  As a hop and IPA lover I will be stocking my fridge with more Ruination!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,purplehops,4.32,Ruination pours a crystal clear orange-amber color with a big white head that clings to the sides of the glass. The aroma is a combination of sweet floral hops and citrus hops with a hint of candy like smells. Not unpleasant at all. The taste starts with strong malt sweetness that is quickly overcome by the bitterness of the hops. The finish is full of earthy hop flavors balanced with a combination of malt and fruity yeast flavors. The aftertaste is pure yummy cascades with subtle hints of citrus and spice notes and alcohol. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with no real carbonation tingle in your mouth. Overall a great west-coast IPA. Dry-hopped to the max but still some hints of malt and a nice fruity yeast to balance it all out. That is balanced for a hop lover.,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,brakspear,4.19,"One should know what they are getting into if they try this beer. If you are not a hophead, you probably will not be awestruck like some of the reviewers. ""A liquid poem to the glory of the hop"" just about says it all.  The beer pours a nice amber with a soft white head that disappeared rather quickly, probably because of all the hop oils present in this beer.  The aroma and taste both highlight the same thing: the pounds of hops that lace this most pungent IPA. Stone Brewing must keep the local hopyards in business just by brewing Ruination.  The citrus blast on the nose is quite impressive, along with the alcohol that is hidden just below the surface.  The taste, even with the 100 IBUs, is still balanced ""well"" (a relative term) by a sweet chewy malt body. Still your taste buds will certainly be scoured by the bitterness from the hops. Not a subtle beer, but subtlety was not what Stone has in mind.  This is not a session beer, but on an infrequent basis would add a jolt to your beer drinking sessions.  Thanks to EnTil for the sample!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,kunzbrew,4.6,"This is one I have been looking forward to. The big 22 oz. bomber bottle has my name written all over it. Pours a stunning semi-hazy light copper to straw color with a very thick 3 fingered head. The nicest sexiext lace I have ever seen on an IPA is left behind on the sides of the glass. I can smell the hops from about 2 feet away from the glass, this is an amazing smelling glass of beer. A strong smell of hops is pouring out of the glass at such a rapid rate, I can not wait to taste this momma. The hop flavor is outstanding and this is the best IPA I have every had. The hops are so strong the after taste is so nice WOW. This has to be one of my favorite brews from Stone they are simply amazing.  Cheers",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,kbub6f,4.35,"Bought online, ground shipping (unrefrigerated), 2-3 weeks in my fridge, served 45F, reviewed 45F-65F.  Big, creamy white, dense, foamy head reluctantly dissipates, clinging thickly to the glass. The color is deep gold with not even a hint of opacity.  The nose is hops (surprised?), slightly metallic (alcohol maybe?). It smells a little yeasty. Somewhat less aromatic than I was expecting.  Holy Mother of Hops! The front lets about a half a second of malt through before the hops absolutely kick your ass! Baby! The middle is sweet... the malt reasserts itself (especially as the beer warms up). And there's the alcohol. The finish is hugely bitter, as expected, and lasts forever. My tongue is curling up at the sides near the back.  Overall, this is one delicious beer. I expected the hops to overpower everything else. But at slightly warmer temperatures the malt is strong enough to poke through and the alcohol warms and makes the beer big enough to accommodate all those IBUs. This is an aggressive, deep, ""arrogant"" monstrosity of a California IPA.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,OldFrothingSlosh,4.7,"""A liquid poem to the glory of the hop!""  9 words that truly describe the elixir of life contained within this gargoyle-guarded amber bottle.  Appearance: 22oz. amber bottle with the beer brewer equivalent to the surgeon general's warning on cigarettes plainly telling you of the impending doom about to be unleashed upon your taste buds should ye be foolish enough to open it. But...deep in the darkest corners of your soul you wonder...""100+ IBU""...what does that taste like? And thus, with the ease of flicking a bottle cap, you have become addicted. Addicted to the insanity that is Stone's Ruination IPA.  Smell: You can almost see the vapor escape. It weaves a tantalizing dance of citrus, pine cone, and delicate sweetness that leaves you mesmerized.  Taste: Understandably, one might think that with an IBU of 100+ that this beer would allow you to collect the life insurance policy on your taste buds. Such is not the case. Indeed, following the first sip freshly poured from the cold bottle, I was concerned over the future functioning of my palate, given the stranglehold placed upon it by this wicked concoction. But, upon warming a bit, we see that this is one devilishly smooth gargoyle. The hops, while present in quanities to rival our national budget, are tempered by the malt character. Lke a knight battling a fierce dragon, the malt stands firm, refusing to yield to the evil serpentine abomination that is the hop. And this...this is such a wonderful thing to behold. The hops are so flavorful, not bitter as expected and that made this experience so much more enjoyable.  Mouthfeel: A prostitute for the palate. An incredible creamy smoothness that fondles your taste buds for what seems like an eternity.  Drinkability: Thank the makers that this is a 22oz. bottle. The alcohol is superbly woven into the fibers of this beer. I could drink this forever. Truly an incredible experience.

147,4083,bewareOFpenguin,3.9,"I am beginning to understand Stone, ""let's pack all our beers with a ton of hops."" No exception here. Poure a hazy color, not too light. It tasted, well, quite hoppy. Not overpowering like Stone's other offerings, but still quite hoppy. It was a good sipping, end of night beer, but I could not pop one after another of these.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Todd,4.41,"1 pint and 6 oz bomber bottle, brown with no bottled on info. 100+ IBU's ... insane.  Pours a magnificent looking beer, at first ... quite pale, touch of cloudiness (expected as this is unfiltered), and topped with a patchy, frothy, white foam head; retention could be better.  Aroma is even more magnificent, full of so much perfumey hop character that your mind drifts, dizzy, into another zone.  The taste ... this is one smooth bastard of a beer. Malt flavour is defining-ly bready / toasty up-front with a thick-ish, creamy mouthfeel. A hoppy beer indeed, but not ""bitter,"" as one might think. It's all about the malt and alcohol with this beer, the hops try to punch through but get smoothed into the overall flavour. That said, the hop character is extremely flavourful with woody / herbal / flowery notes and a citric edge that melds quite nicely with the prickly alcohol. Speaking of alcohol, it's persistent and very warming. Todd like.  Loads of fruity flavours, but mostly pineapple and other tropical fruits. Finish gets a bit dry, touch of yeast feel and flavour and woody hop residuals. Plenty of bready leftovers, too.  Although a bit same-y in comparison to some of the other hopped up Stone beers, there's no denying that this is one helluva kick-ass beer! Flavours are off the scale, drinkability frightening and the effort/passion put into this beer is a beautiful thing, and very apparent.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,aaronh,4.21,"Pours a hazy, deep orange/amber with a dense, creamy tan head that never seems to subside. The aroma is strong on hop florals and a bit of pine. The flavor is all hops up front, but then a nice surprising malt sweetness slides in behind all the hops and supports them nicely. Hop bitterness shows again on the finish to clean things up. Very solid mouthfeel is definitely a strong point of this beer. A very good IPA that has excellent hopping levels. Glad it comes in a 22 ounce bottle, because 12 ounces would not be enough of this great beer.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,johnrobe,4.37,"This brew made me murmur the Homer Simpson mantra...""Mmmmm.....beer."" Simply Delicious (yes, with a capital ""D""). This brew pours a hazy light orange amber with an off-white head that left rings of lace down the sides of the glass. Loads of piney and citric hops in the aroma. You don't even have to sniff, the hops invade the air and assert their presence. Grapefruit, pineapple and citrus all hit your palate in the first wave attack. Surprisingly, there's a healthy helping of bready and caramel malts that show up around mid-palate providing nice balance, but ultimately beaten into submission by a veritable horde of PNW hops. A huge IPA, malt lover's approach with extreme caution.  Don't drink straight from the fridge, let it warm up a bit or the hops will be overwhelming.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,49degrees,4.28,"OK, so we've all seen the stupid ad on television about ""bitter beers"" and what that Brand X says, ""bitter is bad."" Well, if bitter is bad, that Brand X better check out Stone Brewery of San Diego County with their red hot lineup of wicked (that's good) bitter beers. We've all heard of Arrogant Bastard and its cousin the Double Bastard, but don't let the Ruination IPA slip you by,  Damn - this one is bitter - but here, bitter is BETTER. Sold in a traditional the 22oz bottle (650ml for us Canadian folk) this whopper of an IPA is set at an unheard of 100+ IBUs -- as George Carlin would say, ""that'd knock a buzzard off a S****-wagon!!"" This really is a truly remarkable beer. Not only do they hit what may be the highest hop factor in an ale, they do so with such elegant ease, ensuring that the aroma, texture, and taste of this beer hits its mark each and every time.  Pours a rich golden hue with suitably large head -- something that never really sits less than 1/6"" high. Lacing is superb along the entire glass, so much so, that the lacing once there, won't budge until you have finished your beer and are ready to clean the glass.  An extremely bitter aroma, almost overwheling, but not quite. Incredible mossy tones with heavy accents of pine throughout, plus some accents of a fruity complexture. As for the taste, it closely mirrors what is found in the aroma -- heavy but well balanced hops with an incredibly long aftertaste -- something that has yet to be paralleled from any brewer on either side of the Atlantic.  I first poured this one, and started drinking it straight from the fridge. It was almost overwheling at that point, but as the beer heated up closer to room temperature, its incredibly robust characteristics really started to shine. With such striking characteristics, one is forewarned to keep Ruination IPA as your final drink of the night because it lives up to its billing -- ""by the time you develop a taste for this beer, you may find that you are permanently ruined from being able to enjoy lesser brews!""",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,goz,4.54,"Copper in color, small whiteish head, good lacing. After the pour, the aroma filled the room with hoppy goodness. Pine & citrus greet the nose, and entice you to tip the glass and take a swig. Once in the mouth, the hops dominate the palate, coating the tongue with a thick, resiny, oily goodness. Citrus, pine, and maybe some cedar planking in there. Hops overpower the malt, leaving it a little unbalanced, but that is what I have had a taste for lately, it seems. A very large IPA, to say the least.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,putnam,4.75,"Thanks again to John Neil for delivering the goods from downtown Ohio.  Anxiously anticipated. Would it be too extracted? Actually, the hops in this beer may be more finely integrated than in the regular Stone IPA. No brushed metal drop-off on the finish. Deep, dark majestic bronze color suggests the reason. There is plenty of malt in this baby. Not as ruinously bitter as Rogue's I2PA IMO, and better for it. Lots of cedar, cigarbox-like aromas and flavors. Weighty and long. This is more of a marinade for the skull than a beer...",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,WVbeergeek,4.7,"Wow!!! I have finally gotten ahold of the Ruination IPA, and I feel that there is so much anticipation behind the rating of this beer. First of all, I love this style and equally important it is brewed by Stone. IMO Stone brewing is revolutionary from the Bastard to the Smoked Porter. So, here it goes, the beer is poured into an official Stone Brewing Co. Pint glass leaving about two fingers of head. A deep copper goldish tint is the hue that this beer represents. As the gargoyle on the bottle stares at me, I attempt my first sip of this creation. WIth my first gulp, I took a deep breath to absorb all of the hop aroma that engulfed my senses. The hop aroma is a floral, citrusy, and earthy mixture of wonderful hops, with a sharp sweetness to the nose it bitters as it splashes down on my tongue with the welcoming bitterness (100 + IBU's) a trace of sweet maltiness tags along to balance out the beer to become a masterpiece. On the back of this bottle there is a warning of the what this beer can do to the palate. I agree that it is hilarious, and that I would not start out with this beer at tasting event. However, it is not to overwhelming for my tastes.... I love hops. If this beer and the Dogfish Head 90 min IPA were tried side by side a lot would be confused about which be was delivering which flavor. I think they are both sickeningly yet amazingly hoppy, yet I think I prefer the 90 min IPA. Definitely amazing a must try for all beer advocates.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,RonfromJersey,4.85,"Incredible looking bottle. A bright orange-yellow body, with just a hint of chill haze perhaps, topped by a frothy ""just-off-white"" head. The aroma is stunning. I popped the bottle and poured half. The citrus and pine coming from an arms length away is mind boggling. Inhale deeply and the cold you didn't know you had clears away. Taste: I'm sure there is malt in there somewhere, I just haven't stopped to look for it yet. Wait there it is. The sweet malt rolls in first, to set up a wall of sandbags before the hop explosion follows. Grapefruit, pine, even some lemon. This is not a ""chugger"", it is more of a hearty mouthfull, and then pause and reflect.  Many thanks to Gusler, my secret Santa, for the bottle. Many thanks to Greg, the Arrogrant Bastard, for making the stuff.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

""Oh that smell"" To quote Lynard, ""Tis hops"" that greets your nose, chased by a bit of malt and a lemon-lime crispness, quite a Hoot. A tad sweet at the start and the top middling in mouth feel with the finish survigrously hopped with a hard-hitting acidity and a devastatingly dry hop bitter aftertaste. Haven't tasted this much hops since I took a sip of ""Hop Oil"", which is also a Hoot if you have not seen or tried it.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Longstaff,4.97,"WOW. I don't think I can do this one justice or add to what has already been said, but this is one big, bad, malty, insanely hoppy, kick-ass beer that has everything I love in beer. When you pour this mother out, you can tell it is thick and malty and will have the mouthfeel of syrup. The grapefruity, floral, earthy, and herbal hop aromas can be smelled from across the room. After I poured my first pint, my roomate asked if I had been brewing earlier, and said he could smell the hops as soon as he walked in the room. The flavor of this beer is the closest I have come to heaven. The hop flavors are demanding of your attention by hitting you in the face as well as exhibiting some complex subleties. I detect some grapefruit flavors, pineapple, and pine needles in the hop profile. The bitterness is there but not as bad as you would think because the ultra sweet malt sure subdues it. The malt background is sweet like molasses with some buttery and butterscotch flavors that seem to melt in your mouth. All in all a greatly complex beer that is so drinkable for all of its bigness. All other beers taste like water in comparison.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,LarryV,4.75,"Pours a dense, cloudy reddish amber color with nice frothy head. The aroma is hoppy, floral - rather subtle considering the blast of hops one gets when tasting it. This is a big beer, wonderfully balanced. Despite the high hoppiness, the hops never seem overbearing and seem nicely balanced with the slightly fruity background. Dense, creamy mouthfeel is superb. I think it's very drinkable, but be wary of the alchohol content. Creeps up on you after a few.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,HossMcGraw,4.6,"Ridiculously over the top beers are kind of a pet peeve of mine, as they're usually not very good, but this one works. The head, carbonation, and mouthfeel of this beer are just exceptional. The taste is indescribeable. It's endlessly complex and delicious. I recall reading a reviewer comparing the taste of this to and english meadow. That's really what this reminds me of, although it's been a while since I've grazed at an English meadow. Go out and try this!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mickstepp,4.85,"Okay here's a test for a beer. Bit of a headcold. Olfactory nerves barely functional. Taste buds not doing much better. I should have waited for a more opportune time to crack open the Ruination but I simply could not resist. First of all, is there a brewery with better packaging and narrative on the bottle? I don't think so. The beer pours golden and slightly cloudy with a big thick head with major staying power. The head thickly laces the pint glass all the way down. Despite my headcold that lovely pungent hop aroma makes it through. And from the first taste I know I'm drinking something special. A little tart, a little sharp. The taste evolves and transitions as it works its way over the tonque and down the throat. Ripe melon to grapefruit. Beautiful citrus and herbal notes. Nicely dry and very, very hoppy but in my view not over-hopped. A true hophead, I have never tasted an overhopped beer. It's an abstract concept to me. As I finish my Ruination I can feel my sinuses clear a bit. My sense of taste and smell renewed. What a lovely curative is Ruination!",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Let's start with the nose...a strong citrus aroma is present with some subtle pine needle notes as well....the aroma is like an invitation to what sounds like a kick-ass party....and the flavor (the party itself) is everything the aroma (invitation) promised..

A thin sticky off-white head leaves some very nice lace patterns down the walls of my glass. The nose is a virtual hop garden. Floral, spicy, slightly piney, but mostly oily, pungent and resiny. Very nice. The first thing I notice up front on the buds is the bitterness. What a bite. I love it. After that, I notice other hop attributed characteristics: pungency, oilyness, citrus, pine, and to a slighter extent, orange rind. Malt profile really takes a background in this beer. Moreso than any of the other IPAs I've had from Stone. Seems to be around only for balance as I have a hard time picking up any distinctive malt tastes on my palate. This beer is truly all about the hops. Nice firm body of about medium-full. For a beer of this IBU caliber, the drinkability is good.  Let's face it. Stone is one of the best ""Big Beer"" producers around. And this beer does that reputation justice.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95

An extremely balanced IPA despite the fact that it rings in at 100 IBU's in the bitterness department. Full, rich and yes, you can taste malt here. No, the malt isn't a big player, but it rings the hops down to the point that they aren't as overwhelming as you are expecting.

Not to worry though...a quick swirl of the glass brings it back up, and it stays this time.  Smell: Wow...this beer has the most powerful hop aroma I've ever experienced. Amazing. I didn't smell for long...I HAD to taste this brew...  Taste: If you think the aroma is full of hops, you're in for quite a surprise! Full-bodied hop flavor...pine, floral, grapefruit, citrus, you name it, it's in there. The hop flavor is overwhelming if you're not used to such a powerful brew. My tastebuds are actually getting numb as I kill this bottle. There's a good malt background, but you really have to search for it. Drinking this beer after all the others I've tried is akin to going from black and white television to full digital color! It's so full of flavor and so aggressive and complex!  Mouthfeel: Impressive. Very impressive. Goes down with a medium mouthfeel, but again the hops take over and remind what kind of beer you're drinking.  Drinkability: Hmmm...this is probably the only area where this beer suffers. It's truly an amazing beer, easily one of the best I've encountered in my many years of 'better beer' drinking. However, I can't imagine putting away pint after pint of this brew...it's simply too powerful. I thought I had tried some hoppy beers, only to be sucker-punched by this outstanding example!  To sum up, this is one of the most incredible beers I've ever tasted. Given that it's my first brew from Stone Brewing, I can't wait to try more...I've got a couple more of their beers in my fridge and it's taking all of my self-control to stop myself from trying them right now!

147,4083,TheLongBeachBum,4.5,"Heard a lot about this, and found out that my local beer shop sold it. A huge 1pt 6 fl.oz brown bottle. The bottle is screen printed in gold and dark green which is different, and has a kind of potted history of the beer on the back of the Bottle. Poured with a huge head, which proceeded to slowly recede, leaving an explosion of lace on the side of the glass. A lovely pale golden color when held up to my PC monitor, but curiously it had an orange tinge when held up to a nearby lamp (its 7:45pm when I drink this). The nose is extremely floral and has a profusion of botanical elements. Reminded me of a cross between a freshly mown English Cricket Pitch and Kentish Hopfields during harvesting, with a smidgeon of the local Supermarket fresh fruit counter aromas thrown in for good measure. Gorgeous hop tastes that punch right at the back of the throat and proceed to shadow box your tonsils. Has some grapefruityness dangling in the middle. But this is not overpowering for me, I like beers with plenty of hops  and this certainly has them. It is a very well-balanced hopped beer. Long bitter finish that really teases me to grab the Glass for the next fix. One of the very best IPAs I have ever had. Only draw-back  its strong, and I could only drink say two or three of these. Drinkability for the style is very high though. Wow. AWESOME Beer with more Hops than a One-Legged Tap-Dancer  and a whole 22 fl.oz Bottle to myself. No more Beer Reviews for me tonight !!!!!.

Despite the typically humorous claims on the label, this IPA is much more than hops. Actually the aroma is very floral, and the taste is very well balanced, with lots of sweet malts to balance out what is clearly a well hopped beer. This beer is significantly more complex than I expected, and easier to drink. Very well made, enjoyable.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,NeroFiddled,4.5,"Hazy, golden-orange with a foamy ivory head that holds extremely well and leaves brilliant lace. The aroma is boldly full of citrusy, grassy and earthy hops including flavors of grapefruit and pineapple. The flavor is also boldy full of citrusy, grassy and earthy hops including flavors of orange, peach, and tangerine. But there is also some distinct, sweet caramel malt present beneath the hops. This beer is big! Truly an assault on the senses! INTENSE. RICH. FULL. Definitely a ""one beer"" beer - especially in the 22 ounce bottle! And yet it's balanced with enough sweet malt that you don't fall over with ""bitterface""! However, the alcohol might get you to fall over at a full 7.7% by volume. Astonishing! However, it should be noted - as it is on the back of the bottle - that this is for the ""matriculated imbiber"". Albsolutely worth searching out for the hop head.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,sinistersteve,4.57,"Finally, after waiting all through the summer for Ruination to make its way to Oregon, it has finally arrived and what a joyous occasion it is. An exqusite thick head that never would have violated the sides of my glass, no matter how far it would have rose above the rim and that laces the glass nicely. Piney hop aroma that embraces the nose almost affectionately. Although, the color has a decent copper ale'ish hue to it, I can still read what is on the other side of the glass. Then again, don't judge a beer by its color, this is one great tasting beer. Hoppy, citusy flavor in every mouthfull will keep even the most finiky hophead happy.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mophie,4.87,"Wow. This is one kick-ass IPA. Inviting, seductive copper/orange hue with a creamy off-white head. Exceptional aromas of pine, orange, grapefruit, grapes. Sweet floral fragrances. I expected to have my tongue numbed upon impact by the hop bitterness, but I found this brew, even upon the initial taste, to be extremely smooth and balanced. There are hops aplenty, but they are intricately layered upon a wonderful malt foundation. In fact, I am almost as impressed by the subtle sweetness as I am by the over-the-top pine and citrus hop flavors. Of course, the hops assert their presence in the finish, and in fact my tongue is becoming a bit numb as I work my way through the glass. What a terrific feeling. Add this beer to my top-ten list, thank you very much.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,John,4.92,"Copper/orange color. Monster head sticks around to decorate the sides of the glass. Huge citrus, pine cone, hop aroma. The citrus element is as much flavorful fruit as it is rind bitterness...precisely balanced in that respect. Grapefruit juice anyone? The hops are indeed huge but somehow remain smooth and flavorful. The malt is minimally detectable but manages, not necessarily to balance the brew, but to contribute to the superior drinkability. Wow! This is a killer, juicy IPA. Exceptional. Can't wait for distibution in NY. Greg?",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,hyuga,4.73,"Big sponge-like head that retains fairly well. Beautiful citrus/pine smell that absolutely screams hops. The color doesn't fall short of this impressive level of beauty either. Pale orange that brings the word ""nectar"" to mind. As suggested on the bottle, an army of hops invades your palate. The hops ride in on a a soft and smooth malt blanket, but the assault is not far behind. As is characteristic of these types of hops, very strong citrus/orange peel-like and floral taste. Very subtle maltiness. This is a huge beer. Obviously, if you're a fan of hops, you'll absolutely love this.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mzwolinski,4.8,"A beatiful golden color; highly carbonated with initially thick head which has good staying power and leaves a nice lace, proclaiming that your glass has held a *real* beer, damnit.  Hop oil dominate the boquet -- no surprise. Very fresh smelling, with hints of citrus. Malt is quite present as well -- overall the smell reminded me, in the strength and prsence of the basic elements of the beer, of the smell of wort boiling just after the malt and flavoring hops have been added.  This is a really well-done beer. The taste is complex and, despite the bottle's hyperbole, remarkably well-balanced. Malt hits first with a pleasant sweetness, followed by the hops -- but not all at once. They come in layers, with the citrusy, floral flavors leading the way, followed by a wonderful dry, sharp finish at the back of the mouth.  Ruination is a tasteful, drinkable, innovative beer, and yet another reason why Stone is rapidly establishing itself as the West Coast's premier brewery.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Jason,4.35,"Presentation: 22 oz brown bomber with no freshness date  not to worry because between the amount of hops and the higher level of alcohol this brew should have quite a long shelf life.  Appearance: The head looks like a foamy off white head of a cappuccino and not only stays think and cake like but leaves an awesome trail of lace down the glass. The pale sunset orange colour is vibrant and clear.  Smell: Perfumy sweet hop oils with big yet rounded citrusy smells, a bit piney and tobacco like sharpness within. Some alcoholic esters, soft toasted malt and fruitiness makes for a very diversely aromatic brew.  Taste: Sturdy medium body with a deeply smooth mouth feel from the even carbonation. After a second of limbo and a quick shot of malt the taste buds start to comprehend the amount of hops and all of their intricate flavours. At first there is an initial rush of floral, soft but every evident. Next is the onslaught of bitterness which comes in quick with a level pungency pushing out piney, citrus rind and leafy / woody flavours. The malt swings in with a mild toasted grain character and light fumes of the alcoholic esters come forth. Then the malt is pushed aside as the coarse side of the bitter hops drops tobacco and earthy flavours far into the finish. Finishes semi dry with a sizeable puckering effect.  Notes: This is one hell of a hoppy brew, not overkill like other massive IPAs but more over aroma, flavour and bitterness as a whole. BTW this beer is devastating to the palate so dont drink anything that you may want to taste after this beer as the taste buds will become numb in a way. A daring brew that gives you more than enough hops.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Bierman9,4.47,"This was quite the interesting bier! Enjoyed this while sitting out on the back deck enjoying the sunset on a warm summer day. Poured a luscious, medium-golden color, with a creamy, white head, and A-1 lacing. A myriad of aromas melded together. There was some malt lurking around as well as lots of hops. The hops were very much on the sharp, spicy side. I also found a strong yeasty aroma, like the smell of a yeast culture before you pitch a homebrew. Has real good body, and it passed smoothly over the tongue. As for flavors, again I found a slew of different, pleasurable things. Had a foundation of crackery, toasty malt upon which was laid some yeastiness and then the hops! Like in the aroma, the hops were quite spicy, though with some warming a hint of citrus showed up. I like it! A big-time thanks to Murph for the sample! Stone rocks!!  overall: 4.4 appearance: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | mouthfeel: 4.5 | drinkability: 4.5  296",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Brent,4.35,"Worth the price of the beer just to read the bottle, which exclaims that it is ""a liquid poem to the glory of the hops"" and 100+ IBUs. I half expected a mushroom cloud to form over the bottle when I popped the top. Aroma was peppery hops. I braced myself and took the first sip (gulp, actually). To my surprise, the hops were quite smooth and very well balanced with the malt - and the hops, although powerful, are not at all overwhelming. In comparison with Stone's IPA, the hops in Ruination are not as grapefruity, and tended to have more of a herbal character. A must-try for any hophead, but overall I prefer the IPA, which seemed more heavy-handed with the hops.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,Murph,4.85,Pours a bright golden with a huge pillowy/rocky white head that leaves a great lace all the way down the glass. Slight juicy fruit aromas with huge hop oil smells that singed my nose hairs. Intense hop bitterness that lasts from start to finish. As the brew begins to warm the malt character of the beer really shows up and balnces this brew very nicely. There are more juicy fruit flavors as well but they are subdued by the dominant hops. Very crisp and dry on the tongue as well as very refreshing and insanely drinkable for the amount of alcohol and bitterness in this brew. This is an absolutely amzing beer but can I really expect anything else from Stone?,Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,marc77,4.4,"Clear light copper in hue, topped by a fluffy, well - retained off - white head that leaves sparse lace. Grapefruit and pine ""4 C"" American hop nose & mild caramel malt sweetness in aroma. Although the bitterness is expectedly assertive, it is accompanied by a surprisingly rich, toasty, lightly buttery, malt backbone. The citrusy hop flavor comes as no surprise, but is very well integrated into the overall flavor profile. Smooth mouthfeel, with a full, dextrinous body. Finishes w/ a bittersweet balance of hop bitterness and residual malt sweetness. Ruination is an exceptional IPA that showcases American hops, but malt character is not at all lacking. Don't let the 100+ IBUs scare you.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,aracauna,4.06,"I have to admit I was afraid of this beer. The bitterness of beer always gave me problems, but I have managed to gradually build up a tolerance to hops and have even managed an appreciation for hoppy beers ala HopDevil. Still I was afraid of this beer because of all the talk of it being over 100 IBUs. Then I crack it open. Sure it's huge hops (black pepper, citrus peel and flowers) but not as much as I was expecting. I take a big swig and ... it goes down easily. It's kind of cool how the bitterness and most of the flavor is time delayed. The huge flavor doesn't hit until right about the time I swallow. You get a bit of malt at the beginning and some more in the end as the beer warms, but the hoppage overpowers it. I'm still burping the hops 4 hours later.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
147,4083,mickeymac,4.08,"It's a pretty amber with a healthy beige head that leaves traces all the way down the glass. The smell of hops is almost overwhelming but still very pleasant. I found it a bit too bitter to qualify as an exceptional beer. Citrus is present in the taste and it does leave a bit of residual sweetness but not as much malt flavor as I would have liked. It has a nice fairly chunky mouthfeel for an IPA, but the bitterness detracts a bit from the drinkability. The 5th Anniversary IPA is quite a bit better IMO.",Stone Brewing,"California, United States",Imperial IPA,95
