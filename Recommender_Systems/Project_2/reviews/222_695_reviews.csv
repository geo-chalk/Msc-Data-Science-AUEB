222,695,Hamme,5,"When the pints start to taste watery, a Duvel will never disappoint. It is middle of the road amongst the special beers, which i consider a good thing. The taste is spicy like chilly and very satisfactory. Even though expensive i can highly recommend Duvel.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,BigIronH,4,"Pours a cloudy straw gold. A huge white foam head emerges and stacks up almost like cappuccino foam. Lots of sticky lacing and streaming carb. Nose is lemon rind, baked white bread, some grassy notes and what seems to be a lingering bitterness. Taste starts out tart lemon with some herbal notes and transitions to a honey sweetness and finishes a baked bread/cracker. Feel is soft and nearly chewy with a good carb bite. Overall I’m very pleased with this.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,klarcbarr3,4.4,"A huge, 3 inch head poured over a clear but slightly hazy, beautiful gold beer, the head receded like a thundercloud slowly changes, with a chiffon central head remaining tall, above the outer ring to the glass. Lacing is abundant. The nose is sweet, herbal, lemon citrusy, with a freshness accenting the unique hops profile. Carbonation is ample, far more than I am used to, diametriclly opposed to the dark sweet pumpkins and barrel aged brews I prefer. I am trying Duvel because it is touted to be one of the best beers in the world, and I would like to the the very best examples of styles I am less familiar with. The taste is sweet, salty, yeasty, wheat-centric and moderately hoppy. I have given up on American lagers, pilsners, and other golden beers long ago. None of them ever tasted as good as this. I can see myself buying a four pack once in a while, especially in the heat of summer. I am enjoying the boozy feel of relaxation as this beer goes down... it's got more of a kick than I have ever experienced from a white-golden brew. I can see the attraction! Let's raise another Duvel Belgian Strong Blond!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,highdesertdrinker,4.25,"Pours a straw gold from those famous curved bottles with lots of head and good lacing . Be ready to pour when the top of these yeast monsters comes off. Smells musty, with maybe some clove, citrus, and banana. Tastes like banana, clove, yeast, must, some citrus hop and maybe a little grass. It’s balanced but a little hot and it is a Belgian Strong Ale. I like this beer but I probably like the Citra hop version a tad better and Westmalle Tripel is my jam but a solid brew and a classic for sure, cheers!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,rtrimble,4.94,"This may not be the world's best beer, but it's the best beer I know after a lifetime of drinking beer.  I've tasted better, tho not many. And those that did taste better have not consistently tasted better. They vary according to mood and context. They're just right one day, too strong the next. Then too mild, too bitter, or too sweet. Duvel, on the other hand, is always just right—like Goldilocks' favored porridge. Duvel is a five-star beer at the end of the trail, a French restaurant, or a summertime barbecue. It's part session IPA, part champagne.  How does it drink? With as much crispness as glacial water from the Fortress of Solitude. Not too sweet, with a bitter tang that marinates the tongue.  Nose is dried citrus and bread, faint banana and clove. Most Belgian strongs are strong on the banana and clove, smell like fruitcake, which makes them great for Christmas, but not for the trailhead.  Duvel pairs well with a cara cara orange or sourdough bread, whether toasted or grilled with herb havarti and lingonberry spread.  How to pour: Rinse a wide-mouthed glass and leave a teaspoon of water in the bottom. Tilt yer glass and let the Duvel fall into the center of that teaspoon-sized pool. This will cut the head down. You may not cut the head clean off (though you can with skill), but you'll cut it in half, which results in the optimal carbonation.  I've always been a friend of the Devil. I guess it's no surprise that Duvel is a friend to me, and has been (and hopefully will be) for many, many years. Cheers!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,alexaedita,4.18,"This is a very good brew. I had back in Rotterdam years ago on tap. WOW. Bottled version is not far from tap, of course missing some punch to it. If you can find it under 5$ a bottle, buy it. I tend to disagree that it is meant to be enjoyed chilled. I consume it at room temps, to get the best out of the flavors it so generously provides to my palate.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Andrew_craftbeer,4.44,"Probably the catchiest sophisticated beer. It's extremely accessible for its style and this is where you would probably want to start your journey in craft beers.  I think this is the best balanced ale I've ever encountered! Nothing in particular stands out, but it works too well... much too well.  From the beautiful subtle golden color, with foam levels that scream 'perfection' to the extremely catchy yet rich taste and overall pleasant feel (especially the high CO2 content), this is the definitive Pale Strong Ale!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

The tulip glass is top notch. This is a very good brew but the high carbonation brings it down a notch for me.

222,695,Luscious_Malfoy,4.31,"poured from a 330mL bottle into a karmeliet oversized tulip glass. pours a fairly clear straw gold but gathers in the glass a little foggier gold with an enormous soapy white foam head. as i pour the remainder and even as the beer is consumed, the foam looks like some kind of science experiment gone wrong. citrusy orange and lemon on the nose with a mustiness to it that i am intrigued by as much as i am digging it. taste follows with a bright citrusy start followed by a strong alcohol presence. as it warms there are faint notes of clove and belgian esters but overall it’s pretty easy drinking for 8.5%. that said, the belgian yeast flavors are what makes this a sipper for me, not the alcohol content. medium-full mouthfeel. not as bubbly as i would have guessed from the amount of head it threw but still very lively carbonation. a great drinking experience - a classic ale for a reason.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Massive craggy bright white head leaving layers of soapy lacing.  Nose is neutral, nothing good or bad.  Nice tasting beer. Warming, a little sweet. A light dry spice note. Easy drinking considering the abv.  Mouth full, finish a dry bitterness.  Overall, enjoyable drink. Not too heavy or overpowering.

222,695,Perioddicals,4.56,"L - Poured from a standard bottle into a large wine glass. Huge head on mild pour. Light golden clear color. Head slowly dissipates to thick suds with mild lacing, and then to a healthy film that stays through the beer.  S - Light fruit and sweet scents up front. Some apple and possible citrus. A pleasant sweet yeast scent appears part way through drinking. Some more earthy tones are noticed as well.  T - Taste follows scent with sweet fruits like apple, pear, and mild citrus., but adds some spice in there. Some muted floral notes appear as you drink. Not bitter though. More of a sweet yeast flavor as you drink. And then some more earthy flavors come out as well as it warms up. Agitation brings back the sweet fruit characteristics, but definite sweet yeast as the main flavor. Somewhat boozy toward the end.  F - What a smooth mouthfeel at first. A healthy amount of carbonation stays as you drink it. Top notch.  O - Overall, this was a fantastic and enjoyable beer. I had casually avoided Duvel assuming it was a generic European macrobrew. I was wrong and this beer is a treat. I will definitely add it to my regular rotation.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Never disappoints.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,AlexandraDen,4.17,"Pours a beautiful, clear pale golden-straw colour. Three finger thick white creamy head slowly compacts into a one finger, dense foam that lasts the rest of the beer.  Interesting and subtly complex aroma, slightly sour aromas of gentle funkiness. Earthy, more like damp leaves and wood than a horse barn kind of funk. Yeasty esters play around with a slight bitter, floral and grassy hop smell. Subtle banana and cloves, typical of most Belgians. I might have an older bottle, but I swear there is a vinous, grapey smell as well on a deep inhale. A tiny bit of bready, toasty malt, but I find it takes a backseat to the sour viney damp smells.  Taste is very subtly complex as well, very pale and gentle sourness on the tip. Earthy and moist like wheaty aromas. Some subtle yeast notes with the malt. There is a savouriness as well here. I’ll mention again I think my bottle is older, which has brought out some nifty aromas and I think tempered the flavours a bit and evened them out. Some bitter citrus peel is noticeable as well, and a pleasant bitterness on the finish that is semi-sweet, a bit viney, with a white grape like taste.  I didn’t notice the alcohol as much as others. This is a light-medium bodied beer with good, medium level carbonation. Nice bittersweet, grapey and bready finish that is mostly dry.  Pleasant, complex, and easy drinking. I’d love to try a bottle that is super fresh just to compare. I’ll leave the review like this for now and hopefully come back soon!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Really good-",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,TheMatts,4.18,"Smells like a citrus and bread, maybe even a small bit of grassiness that is also in the flavor. Lots of carbonation. Taste has some bitterness in it but not bad, some small fruit smell and flavors along with malt and barley and breads. The alcohol is noticeable but not too noticeable, to me this is the perfect higher ABV taste, with bold flavors but not a whiskey taste. As you continue drinking it gets more and more enjoyable. Great beer. Not a note-able aftertaste. The feel is semi-heavy.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,eluvah,4.35,"Smells sweet like honey as soon as I opened the bottle. A little banana as well. Tastes of banana and bubble gum. This beer is very carbonated and I feel it overpowered the taste. It is a good beer, glad I tried it but doubt I will ever buy it again due to price.

222,695,UnoBeero,4,"As a someone who was introduced to Belgian ales from Unibroue's interpretations, I was excited to find one of the staples in my local liquor store. I had a great experience with the Chimay range and was looking forward to this one.  Nose: Mild, semi sweet malt  In the Glass: Well foamed or formed head, rises quickly to show it's pale golden shine. Great looking beer.  Palate, Crisp, orange citrus, sharp bitterness that fades into a full body of well malted barley. Crisp and sharp but not bitter.  Finish: That sharp citrusy body fades into a mellow alcohol and malt flavour. Overall I can see why people covet this Ale. Unlike Chimay and Unibroue's offerings you do taste the High ABV with this one, hence the 4/5 rating. Not perfect but a fantastic ale.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Overall a nice tasting, fresh beer, but too pricey and overly carbonated. I bought about 100 of these little guys a few years ago when a supermarket chain made a print error in their catelogue and advertised them at less than half the normal price.

222,695,JohnniEMc,3.91,"Only 11.2 ounces fit into the short squat brown bottle. Even if you don't like it, the experience shouldn't be drawn out. Concern arises as a deliberate pour into a clear pint glass produces a puffy white, but disingenuous head. It recedes quickly and unevenly. It's not pretty and this character often forecasts a body that will be too light. The color is pretty nice. It's a light copper-amber with a density about halfway between opaque and translucent. A fair amount of lacing graces the glass where the head has mercifully subsided. Aroma?, at best a little Belgian yeast can be detected. Despite some warning signs, this tastes pretty good. It does indeed have sufficient body that's in great balance with the malt, hops, yeast and alcohol balance. With each sip, or gulp, you can get all four sensations, with the alcohol never taking precedence above the others, despite the relatively high ABV. Light but richly flavorful and for a Belgian Ale, not close to being overly yeasty, this is a delightful brew to consume.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

I drink it at a colder temperature rather than room temp or just slightly cooled because that dampens the spiciness and lets me enjoy it more. I like to drink most of my beers colder overall. If you think Duvel is too spicy or bitter then try drinking it at a cooler temperature. The beer reminds me of Leffe Blonde. Those pale, light, and crisp notes of clove, banana, pepper, spices, hops, tutti frutti bubble gum. Almost creamy with the mouth feel. I love the feel.

Tastes like bread and yeast with a lightly sweet fruit and peppery spice finish. There is almost no hop bitterness. The alcohol hides well.  Medium body and carbonation. Light crisp clean mouthfeel.

As it recedes, it retains a tall tower in the center with gobs of thick and sticky lacing down the side.  Aroma is spice, banana, lightly fruity.  The taste is yeasty and malty at the front, spice, banana with some stone fruitiness as well. A bitterness begins in the middle and carries through to the finish and aftertaste. The finish is a bit sticky, coating the mouth, while also ending with a nice dryness. No alcohol detected in the taste.  It has a moderate body, with a pleasant effervescence.  Given the ABV, this is a dangerously easy drinking beer. It requires self control to not just quaff it down.  Overall, an excellent, very enjoyable, beer.

I had this once before on tap and I was pretty impressed, so now it's time for a review  Pours a slightly cloudy yellow gold with 3 massive fingers of soapy white head, billowing out of my glass and never really disappearing, leaving tons of lacing in its path  The smell here is quintessential Belgian. Loaded with banana esters, pepper, baking spices, and citrusy hops. Not much malt present in the aroma, but what's there smells lightly sweet and doughy  The taste up front is a perfect balance of spice and citrus, very bright and lemony. The citrus fades a bit after the swallow, giving way to even more spice and bubblegum like esters with just a touch of grassy hops  This drinks wayyyy lighter than 8.5%. The body is medium light and the carbonation is intense and effervescent, making this straight up crushable for the abv. Finishes mostly dry but still coats the mouth to remind you there's some strength  This is amazing stuff right here, it's the standard for a reason.

Taste: Slightly fruity but not so much that it didn't taste like a beer with a classic Strong Ale character to the main flavour profile, this was followed by a noticeable bitter taste that was for me much nicer than most IPAs, and despite the high abv, I find this beer to not taste boozy.

With those disclaimers, I have had probably more than my fair share of beers across 42 countries over 55 years I offer the following review:  1. Duvel is the standard for Belgium triples from what I understand from the ""experts"" and I agree.  2. It's readily available to most folks in the USA usually at a store, occasionally on tap.  3. Ok, here's my shot at a taste review (at least it's honest and not condescending):  Medium body with great head (when poured properly). Slight hints of pears carry through the nose and mouth.  I've actually drank it enough to add that I enjoyed it more a little warmer than the typical ""coldest beer around "" temp. My fridge is day at 45 and that's about right.

That bitterness also seems to be revealing its alcohol. F: This beer has a lot of pleasant bubbles. It's extremely crisp. I'm drinking it on a hot summer day and its hitting the spot. O: This is a very drinkable and tasty beer and probably a dangerous one at that. Its strength is hidden somewhere in it and I could easily drink a bunch of them on accident.

222,695,just1cho,3.98,"*Poured into a Teku glass from a 330mL bottle*  This had a slightly hazy pale golden color to it with an impressive two finger thick white colored head. It had great retention to it, almost never dissipating. No complaints about the look of this beer!  This had a faint sweet malt character to it upfront, but this beer was primarily yeast forward in addition to a pronounced presence of phenol. Spicy and peppery in the front and middle aroma, there were a fair amount of banana esters with a bit of cinnamon in the middle and backend. Other than the yeast and a slight malt character, there weren't a lot of depth or complexity in the aroma.  The taste offered a bit of a balance from the relatively yeast forward aroma that I got. There was a sweet malt taste upfront which then evolved to the aforementioned yeast flavors described in the aroma. The beer then finished with a pronounced and long bitterness from the hops.  Full-bodied, a high carbonation, and a dry finish made this a very smooth and drinkable beer. Very quaff-able for the ABV that it has. Although the alcohol is noticeable, it was relatively mellow and not too strong. There was a long lingering bitterness in the aftertaste which is a negative more me personally, but this did not affect the overall drink-ability.  Overall, I thought this was a very drink-able and balanced tasting beer, although it was slightly more bitter than what I prefer in a beer. It's not one of my favorites, but I felt like this is a perfect representation of the style and I wouldn't mind buying/drinking this again.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

F: perfect carbonation and no alcoholic bite  Overall, this is simply one of the best beers in the world. Duvel was the first beer that made me aware of the potential of what a great beer could be. However, I took some time in reviewing Duvel and this is my fiftieth review here on B-A. Wanted No. 50 to be something distinguished and awesome. Duvel fits the bill.

222,695,MaltsOfGlory,3.91,"330ml bottle  Pours a pillowy, mildly soapy looking white head in a plastic cup (do watcha gotta do on a train). Retention is pretty good. Body is golden yellow, clarity is high. Lowish amount of bubbles coming up. Looks pretty nice.  Esters are mild at first, but quickly come out as the beer opens up. Clove, banana. Noble hop aroma is more present than I would expect in most belgian beers, though not off style here. Pretty well balanced, has dry notes, sugars come through as well though. Smells like a sessionable ale that still has a good amount of flavor.  Hits my tongue and oh boy is this mineral forward, like I'm drinking sparkling water. Again, not off style, but this is on the extremely high end of that spectrum. Esters very much play a supporting role. A touch of sweet grain after that initial dry mineral punch. Has a touch of bitterness in the finish. Less balanced than the aroma, certainly lands on the drier side for flavor. Not bad, but a little dry and sparkly for me, would prefer it more balanced.  Mouthfeel and flavor have a fair amount of overlap on this one. Other than the aforementioned bubbles, sugar content (or lack thereof), and bitterness - the body is good, it comes across lighter than it is because of the carbonation. It actually is a medium body on this guy. Mouthfeel on its own is not the issue, but when combined with the flavor it creates a little to be desired. Still, that being said I would grade both on parallel because there work cooperatively here.  Drinkability is quite high for the most part, though you might get full quick from all the carbonation.  Appearance turned out very nice. Lacing was a tad patchy, but overall pretty thick. A small head hung around the whole way down.  Overall a nice beer. Perhaps not my style, but I do feel like this is on the further side of that dry, carbonated spectrum.

It's not a terrible beer. It's just ... mediocre. Boring. One-dimensional. For a strong blonde, it tastes like a bit like a really souped-up industrial lager, with a slightly more interesting flavour profile. But only slightly. The explosive carbonation is the real problem.

Only took me the greater part of a decade . Here is a big cheers to the next 1,000! Enjoyed with proper Duvel glassware  A timeless classic. The consistent quality of this brew alone deserves to be lauded.  Depending on your experience/conditions the Duvel pours a semi-clear and effervescent straw gold body. Some cloudy yeast sediment can be experienced resulting in darker hues. Signature Duvel look in its excitable frothy head of snowy white peaks that really take on a life of their own. Some of the best lacing work you will experience in a brew here. The nose is yeasty spice bread, golden grains, tart green apple, and a light lemony citrus with mineral water. Very clean. The flavor of this is a golden malt delight; so well balanced and dangerously drinkable. Earthy yeast, grassy green hops, golden wheat/malt/grains, and some granny smith apple with mild alcohol spicing. Very dry and creamy in texture with a prickly high carbonation feel.  The devil comes in many forms….I definitely prefer the Duvel fresh as the hops have way more pop. Vibrant and crisp, but this does stand up well to cellaring. I have had a 4-5yr old bottle and with age this brew becomes more white wine and vinous like. The lively yeast and green hops have now mellowed giving stronger expressions of more golden stone fruit and white grape flavors, super creamy texture, and a touch of oxidation.

Unfortunately for me, I was the DD and only managed a sip from someone else's glass. I found a 4-pack at my local store when I got home. This is my new standard for a golden ale.  I do not have a Duvel glass, but picked the closest one to it I own, a brandy balloon style beer mug. It poured well and provided three fingers worth of head, a small amount of foam stuck around the entire 50 minutes I enjoyed it.

Nice nose to it as well, grassy with a good amount of slightly funky Belgian yeast aroma with faint hints of black pepper and apples.  Flavor forward tastes a bit too over sweet to me, with a very sweet, light bodied crystal malt base with some honeyed lightly fruity notes of: apples, lemon, pineapple and over ripe banana.  Finishes with faintly grassy hop hints that increase as it warms, some szechuan pepper / clove spicy Belgian yeast esters on the back-end as well as a strong boozy quality, that together prickle and numb the tongue.  Light bodied and highly effervescent while surprisingly boozy tasting, I thought it was alright but something just didn't work for me, perhaps it was a bit over sweet and lacking in body to balance the alcohol, or possibly the slight numbing sensation on my tongue that gave me an odd of a feeling on an allergic reaction, but either way it was a bit of a disappointment, having had others in this style that I liked a more.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Nose is of fresh Roses or Easter lily fresh flowers/ perfume predominately, and also prominent is hard tack biscuit. Some clove . The perfume smell is a bit much IMO. Taste is amazing, with a full mouth feel and and cloves with a penultimate little bitter dry hop finish that paired with the high alcohol stays on the taste buds in a great way. The thing I do not like is the aftertaste which gets somewhat thin and cloying thin like somebody dumped a shot of gin in the beer. Don't get me wrong, I'll take all I can get, but at the price here in Tx., USA, I won't be getting much, that is for certain, it's way outta my price range..just as well, I found myself wanting something more docile after I slowly imbibed in 1 bottle of Duvel, so I drank a Ice old Lone Star Light- hit the spot.

Score for me is 85 percentile- its obviously great, but i do not like cloves, and the , for your reviewer, almost cloying cheap warm Gin like finish on the palate just wasn't worth the price .",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,omahawk,3.98,"Pours slightly cloudy, mostly clear golden with large head and lots of carbonation bubbles. Smell is slightly stale character malt with background fruitiness. Taste is trademark tanginess that I associate with the Belgian Golden ales and full bready, earthy malts. Delightful effervescence from the high carbonation levels. This style is yeast-driven and I see why this is the brand that defines the style. The yeast flavor is almost biting at times. Obviously a pillar of the style, not my favorite.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,DrBeergood,4,"L: Pale straw gold. Lots of head. Lots of nucleation so that head's gonna stick around. Clear. The head is chunky due to it's bottle conditioned nature. You probably want to give it a gentle roll before you pour. Emphasis on gently. You want to mix the heavier components in without agitating the carbonation.  S: Mostly fermented grain. It's very Belgian. Belgian is synonymous with funky (at least it used to be, that's changing). There's probably some wheat in here too.  T: Flavor is okay. It's got a bit of the banana bread in there. It was fermented over wood. It is a bit funky. I don't think they used any spices, I'm pretty sure that's just the yeast.  F: Drinkable. Which is saying alot because it is a tripel. Not all tripels are drinkable. This is. It's smooth, with wheat's signature savory finish. It's not quite bitter enough to mellow out this exuberant brew, but at least it's not sweet.  O: It's okay. If you want to drink hard and look good doing it, it's for you.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,EF517,4.74,"Look : Rich golden , a little cloudy , sustainable head, looks amazing.  Smell : Slightly fruity with some spice intermingled, complex and appealing.  Taste : Semi-sweet but nicely so. It's dry and fruity, with a delicate aroma that comes through in the taste. It can be dangerous because its 8.5%, and goes down so easy. I first had it in Brussels and found it quite delicious.  Feel : A very pleasant amount of carbonation. For reference, I enjoy wheat beers for the reason of lower carbonation, and the lack of a carbonated backup. This ale comes across very similar. Its luxurious, almost like a champagne almost.  Overall : A great beer, and one that I reward myself with on special occasions. A 750 goes for about $10. And nothing beats drinking it from an ""official"" Duvel glass, because the glass has an old English ""D"" cut into the bottom of the bowl, and bubbles rise from the ""D"".

222,695,defunksta,4.55,"Appearance: Pours a clear golden color that is actively bubbling, giving the beer an alive appearance. A massive, pillowing head that lingers. I poured into a tulip glass and at first it looked like there was going to be no head to I untilted the glass a bit. Boy was that a mistake. The head was massive and pillowing! I had to wait minutes for it to fade to pour the rest of it. A newbie mistake for sure. Aroma: Heavy fruity esters. Lots of pear. Lots of phenols: Banana and clove. Bready and honey aroma. Taste: Sort of spicy and white pepper on the front. Tons of Belgian phenols of coriander, clove, some banana. Not juicyfruit, just yeast and spices. Definitely a pear and possible apricot & apple flavored sweetness that is not overbearing. Pale bread and honey malts. Finishes dry. Feel: Incredible. So full and creamy. Yet bubbly and alive. Finishes dryer than a tripel. Deceptively, making you want another sip. Similar to drinking a marshmallow.  Overall: One of the best beers in the world. So robust in all aspects, yet none is overpowering. From the appearance to the feel, this is the real deal. Drinks dryer than a tripel. Less fruity tart and funk than a saison, which accentuates the Belgian yeast allowing appreciation of the spices and phenols. So well rounded. I'd be interested in comparing this to DuPont's saison or Delerium Tremens. This one really demonstrates the phenols and spices.

The foam is like a kids bubblebath and it feels soooo good in the mouth. Even with no foam the mouthfeel is a good 4.25. The smell is that divine smell that only Belgian beers seem to have, that smell of honey, fruit and citrus, so bright and vibrant thanks to the fruit, but the honey grounds it and it becomes something I can sniff for minutes with a smile. The taste is very good. A nice malts and fruit up front with some honey, and then it finishes with bitter citrus/hops flavor. The latter is not to my taste, but it's very well done nonetheless.

Suffice it to say, the next day was one of the bleakest of my existence thence, but I still could never get the pleasure of the taste of this exotic one of a kind brew out of my mind.

222,695,Mellowship,4.46,"Having lived in Brussels for some time, this was my to-go beer for just about every circumstance. It is sold at Belgian supermarkets and groceries stores for about 1,20€ a 33 cl bottle. Lucky me! First of all, there are some slight batch differences in Duvel (pronounced Doo-ee-vell), with some bottles sporting a clear transparent liquid and others with a small deposit of yeast at the bottom. I advise to turn your bottle slowly to check if there is some sediment and if so, to try to blend it, for it will contribute to a much better aroma. The look is of more of a golden ale than a blonde one, with thick foam, almost like porter-thick, that grows fast upon pouring. The sediments, when present, gives a slight greyish translucent aspect. The smell of Duvel is one of the most identifiable beer smells. I could pick it up any time in a blind tasting. It has yeast all over, and a deep sniff will fill your nostrils with a very distinctive hop, giving away what is yet to come upon tasting it. And indeed, the yeast comes first but not with that typical flavour of bread. It is more of a combination of the yeast with malt, bringing up some faint spicy notes such as cumin, but mainly citrus notes such as a little bit of bergamot, coriander and lemon-grass, and then some heavier notes such as caramel, that combined with the high content of ethanol, gives its particular roundness. The hops then settle in. Not being a strongly hopped beer, the alcohol helps the hop flavours to reach all the corners of your mouth and to explode in contact with the air. Just remember of the high content of ethanol. It is a very addictive beer, but with one and a half bottle, you'll start to get tipsy! I think the Duvel brewers have made a very good job keeping a lot of presence and personality in an industrialised beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,hreb,3.72,"How have I not reviewed this before? This my standard every single time I'd visit the Kebab Factory 12+ years ago. This 33cl bottle dated 04-2020 I picked up at a supermarket here in Bonaire, Dutch Caribbean. Served in a tapered tumbler. Beer is extremely pale, even for a BPA, and could be mistaken for a Corona -- or as it's known around here, Amstel Bright (except it's in a glass). This one at least forms a nice white lacy head.  Aroma is floral from a combination of hops and yeast. Flavor is harsher/stronger than some Belgian pale ales, with a yeasty bitterness, aggressive carbonation over a creamy body, and orange pith. Good flavor, good style, and wide availability make this a winner, but in my opinion there are plenty in the same genre which are more remarkable: Delirium Tremens, La Chouffe, or my personal favorite, Southampton Grand Cru.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Smell of citrus/lemon, along with apple/pear. Some yeast funk. Taste is yeast esters, combined with cracker, lemon and apple/pear mid way, and sweet at the end. Refreshing, light mouth feel. Good carbonation level. Unlike most U.S. made beers; it shows its confident and well established brewing history with each sip.

222,695,cjgiant,4.31,"On a revisit, January 2023, I found I was not enjoying this as much as I previously rated it. As the standard bearer, the beer is likely not to blame, and I believe this is more to do with my preferences than poor quality. In fact, I am not getting huge difference than my original review other than it being drier and less forward with orchard fruit and more citrus rind.  Original review: Finally reviewing this one, bottle BB 12/2018: Pours a lovely golden with a light chill haze (and yellow with a murkier haze if proper decanting is not done). Of course, the cumulonimbus cloud of white head is a well-known property of this beer. This falls into rocky peaks in an interesting near-geologic study. Lacing isn't as heavy as expected, but is quite strong.  The nose is a nicely balanced combination of sweet-leaning orchard fruit and a grassy to very lightly piney hop note. There's not much more complexity than that, but that simple recipe is very enticing.  Taste starts with a light, white cracker malt note. Upon this is layered a thin spread of apple butter. This provides the base upon which a spritz of citrus is added (with a little more tang when the dregs are included). The carbonation isn't as powerful as expected, but is in multitude with each sip. This might aid the pepper notes that come on as we transition towards the back of the beer. The orchard fruit becomes citrus pith as the bitterness starts to gain, combined with the pepper, there's a combined zesty bitterness here.  No surprise, just a well put together pale ale that is medium dry in the end. No frills because none are needed - a moderately complex beer without any extremes.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Beautifully balanced aroma; light cracker-like malt element with a nice light spiciness and sweet grassy herbal tone.

Medium body; soft and delicate; light sweetness and generally lightly sweet mouthfeel overall.  Other than a significant drop in the 'Look' category for me, the beer pretty much measures up (score-wise) as it did for me five years ago.

Ideally to be drank in a tulip glass as all good Belgian ales should be, but I am not a connoisseur just a regular beer dude so an ordinary beer glass will just have to do. Sorry!  Got a massive head on pour, gee whiz a very big frothy head!  Good bit of carbonation, nice creamy white top, took a while to settle.  Colour was cloudy orange, doesn’t look great at all, looks shit in fact.  Head collapses and dies.  Some good lacing……..  On the nose has that usual Belgian ale smell, wheat, the yeast, the coriander, floral hops, fruits of lemon and banana. A very typical Belgian!  A very strong intense smell, really powerful stuff on the nose….which is too be welcomed as I usually smell fuck all from my beers, lol!  On the taste I found it very strong, with a sour taste, very bitter aftertaste and can definitely feel the beer. Yeast and firm hop bitterness. Very strong, got a powerful kick, alright.  Didn’t initially like it at all, but in the end I liked it, took a while for my taste buds to get to enjoy this beer. Found it a slow burner and not bad overall.  Wow, I was buzzing after the two. The 8.5% definitely kicks in.  Nice, I like it, strong to drink, but it does the business in the end. Have a few of these and you are off your head!!!

Medium light bodies with effervescent carbonation. Light creaminess beneath the aggressive carbonation followed by unmistakeable, pleasant, boozy warmth through the finish. Flavors of pilsner malt, sweet sugar, light under ripe banana, bready yeast and spicy pepper. Medium light bitterness through the middle tempers the sweetness fillowed by light floral hoppiness.

The aroma had a beautiful blend of sweet grass, Belgian yeasty/breadiness, light clove, floral hop bits, touch of herbal and some light Belgian candied fruits.

Very refreshing finish and a complex character for scent Taste: A combination of bitter hoppiness matched with a mild fruity and refreshing dry finish. An incredible hybrid between a Beligen pale ale and close to champagne like. One of my favorite combination of flavors. Feel: Crisp and carbonated but takes it time through your mouth.

A touch of the farm yard scent, as well. The beer is a very hazy golden apricot up to the light with a ton of tiny bubbles rising and a monster whipped egg white head that lasts and clings to the glass in like soap. In the flavor, white wine like, loads of green apple, a little funky, pears for days. The feel is medium body, dry, and an Alka-seltzer like carbonation effect. First time having this. Really an enjoyable experience for me.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,1ale_man,4.42,"This is one fine beer!! Poured from 12oz. bottle into a tulip glass. Color of gold and clear with very slight haze. Smells of grain and yeast. Reminds me of feed barrels in my grandfathers barn and bread. Taste is awesome! Can taste apples, grain, yeast and hay. Sorta funky in a very good way. As for feel++very carbonated/fizzy, but good. This is a great beer! I will buy again as a treat to my self. Wish it were less expensive at $15 for 4 pack. Great, great beer!!!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,redgorillabreath,4.27,"I'll avoid redundancy, considering the number of reviews already here.  To me, this is very, very refined for the style. Nothing is present that doesn't belong or required. The yeast certainly carries the day.  I prefer my beer/ale not too cold, and opened a 750ml bottle at 60F. It gushed. The other bottle which was refrigerated at ~42F did not. Not a complaint, just a commentary on the degree of carbonation. Cheers!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,Libeertarian,3.8,"From notes taken 12/16/16:  Have had this for about a year, from a four-pack. Unfortunately, I didn’t review my first one which I enjoyed back in January, and this is only my second. I am using a Duvel chalice/tulip I managed to pick up recently. Semi-clear, swirling with fine haze, metallic straw gold, capped in three inches of pure white seemingly weightless fluff that suggests effervescence. Moderately tart aromas, of vinegar and phenol, but also influenced by grain and booze. Main flavors are somewhat harsh grain and spiciness (from yeast or brewing spices or both?), strong Band-Aid, some lemony tartness. Balanced by fairly sweet malt and booze. Good but it is still a little too harsh for me, though appropriate for the style. I prefer darker and either more overt fruitiness or spiciness for my Belgians, not so much vinegar or medicinal phenol. Retro-olfaction is my second-favorite thing about this beer, just boozy and slightly spicy. My favorite part is the mouthfeel. Light to medium in body, thin for mere moments but level of fine effervescence passes it off as creamy, warming.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Lovely peppery, clove, and subtle sweet aromas carry over perfectly to compliment an earthy and grassy addition in the flavor. Silky smooth, and light enough feeling to make this well balanced beer go down exceptionally well. Overall, this is a world class Belgian golden ale.

222,695,Benjolovesbeer,4.21,"I give the look of this beer a 5 because after pouring it into a tulip my beer looked just like the picture on the back of the bottlecand therefore this is the look the brewers intended. Very foamy beer that sticks with it through the whole experience. A one of a kind for sure that has a liquor, mildly banana, mildly clove flavor with a tiny resemblance to chimay but I'd still prefer chimay. It's a bit like champagne and definitely had its wit appearance and flavor. And it is good for a hot summer day and very drinkable at 8.5abv. Very creamy and sweet with rum undertones. But must give credit where credit is due and that is this beer ages well.

222,695,Mindcrime1000,4.5,"Poured--from a 330 ml/11.2 oz short. Relatively newly born--August 2016, so only two months old.  Look--Classic unfiltered cloudy (just beyond hazy) and pale-gold. Big rocky head, more like a wit than a Belgian strong. The head has some serious staying power, and the lacing is creamy and fabulous throughout. This is just a stupdenous-looking beer.  Aroma--Perhaps a bit subdued in the aroma department compared to some of its fellows, but still very complex. Fruity aromas mixed with spice and just-there maltiness.  Taste--The first word that comes to mind, sip after sip, is balance. In every possible way. Malty sweet. And fruity sweet. Yet just-so on the bitterness. There is also an herbal or spice note that combines with a distinctively strong carbonation to provide a dry kick to finish. The alcohol is definitely there, but strictly as a pleasing and additional drying element--no bite or burn.  Feel--Difficult to separately quantify or qualify from the taste, because it is such a strong component of that aspect. Outstanding attenuation. Wonderful carbonation and warming booziness provides a fine drying finish to a complex flavor. ""Crisp"" doesn't do this justice.  Overall--Everything that makes me favor the Belgian/Flemish approach to brewing is here and then some.

Same with the taste, super amount of alcohol and phenolic yeast. Bitterness is higher than desired. So much of that phenolic spice rack going on. The citric acidity in the mouthfeel seems to bring out the alcohol and sting even more.

A slow pour yields a very clear light-gold or yellow color, and a voluptuous pure-white frothy head. Excellent head retention, and the lacing was amazing. A beautiful beer to look at. The 2nd pour was a little hazier, due to the remaining yeast in the bottle.  S: Very fruity with some yeast/bread notes.  T/F: Very complex flavoring, mostly following the smell. Lots of fruit, balanced with the yeast and bread. Has some spiciness at the end. Didn't really notice much of a hops presence, but that is probably because I'm used to a very upfront IPA hop flavor. Clean and dry finish.  O: Excellent beer. I've been mostly drinking American style beers, leaning toward the IPA side, and this was one of my first tries at Belgian beer.

I know that it may be hard to believe, but I actually can follow directions. It is simply that I just choose NOT to do so.

Color was a slightly hazy Straw-Yellow (SRM = > 2, < 4). Nose had a dry mustiness, like those old newspapers up in my grandmother's attic. I really do mean to bundle them up and put them out for recycling one of these days. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a pleasant effervescence on the tongue. The taste had a light tartness, like green apples. Boy, howdy, it is one dry beer! Phew! Just one sip later and I felt really parched. Man, I am all for dry beers, but this one is almost vinous, like a really dry white wine.

Perhaps some bananas or other tropical fruit are hiding in there and coming out for a peek also.

Smell has aromas of yeast, bread dough, wheat, slight hints of citrus zest and a slight peppery smell. Undertones of clove, spice, and coriander come through.  Taste is initially kind of yeasty and doughy - lots of wheat and bread notes come through, however this is quickly tinged by a nice citrus zest flavor eventually giving way to a slightly peppery and spiced yeast finish. Slight booze taste becomes apparent after sipping for a while, but even then it is sublet and quite nice.  Feel has a nice robust carbonation that somehow does not overpower the flavors.

As an amateur cook I can also find Herbes de Provence, particularly lavender. I can't think of any other beer that has such a delightful fragrance.  Taste is marvelous. This is so good on so many levels it's hard to find a place to start. Floral hoppiness is in perfect balance with the rest. Malt is rich without being heavy, sweet without being cloying, full while remaining clean and a perfect example of when just enough is enough. Malt, yeast and hops all work together in a harmonious complexity that is seamless from start to finish.  Texture is medium.  Overall this is a head and shoulders above the rest sort of beer. A blazing pathfinder that still out distances it's many imitators.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,edward_boumil,4.37,"L: Holds a head well. Intial pours quite robust though it settles, yet lingers. Straw colored, quite murky S: Wheat, dough, yeast, sweet kitchen spices. Some estery smells as well, typical clove T: Once again, dough and spices. Lots of pepper/phenol. Has some notes of clove, a nice rounding sweetness, and a crisp bitterness to balance it out. F: Smooth as hell, that full yet light mouthfeel, pillowy, super well rounded and balanced. Bitter yet not remotely astringent. Refreshing. Excellent. O: Rediculously solid. Not something that blew me away yet at the same time was impressed by. Does what it does well, but doesn't push the envelope.

T: Belgian yeast, spice, coriander, hint of citrus peel, finish is malty with more Belgian yeast characteristics lingering in the aftertaste, spice, banana, coriander, very smooth and drinkable.  M: Medium bodied with a creamy mouthfeel, tons of carbonation.

222,695,Rukeli76,4.54,"I don't have much to say other than this is really the Platonic ideal of the Belgian strong pale ale. The notable thing coming back to this after years of trying many other Belgian beers is how impeccably clean-tasting it is. There's almost none of that Belgian ""funk"" (which I sometimes love) and all of the complex flavours -- this time around I picked up a flowery scent, some black pepper, pears and green apples, and freshly baked white bread, in particular -- just seem so bright and un-muddied.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,Kubishark,3.66,"Pours an enormous and very fluffy head, probably the largest I've seen. Has a light golden color that is slightly murky. The aroma is very yeasty, and a bit spicy as well, with some hops thrown in also. The first sip tasted like champagne, likely exaggerated with the high carbonation. From there it started to taste more beer-like, yet very yeasty the entire time. Crisp and mellow, and nice for sipping slowly, yet not necessarily my style. As mentioned, a lot of carbonation, but with a pleasant feel in the mouth. Overall I respect this beer and its high quality. I think it's something that every beer lover should try. That being said, it was quite a pricey bottle and I'm not sure I would personally value it as high as I paid. A lover of Belgians would probably disagree with me.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Beginner2,4.45,"Moortgat is a master of marketing and Duvel is its cash cow. This combination contributed more to promoting the Belgian tradition in America than any other combo. As a Belgo-phile and quasi-evangelist, I admire Duvel-Moortgat... a lot.  Duvel is reviewed in ""Michael Jackson's Great Beers of Belgium"" in which he describes it for 5 pages and uses it to define his entire chapter called ""Wicked Ales."" Read the chapter (or at least those 5 pages) to know how we should be reviewing... or at least what we should be reading.  Then in his 2003 ""The Brewmasters' Table"", Garrett Oliver continues this tradition saying ""Ardently imitated, but never quite equalled, Duvel is the sole progenitor of the strong golden ales"". My experience is that he is quite correct in pairing Duvel with garlicky foods whereby the bubbles and hops clean the palate for the next bite. I am eager to try his suggestion of pairing with Indian and Thai spices.  Following the lead of two master reviewers and completing the highest accolades of any ale I know, Duvel is also listed in the global listing ""1001"" and certainly deserves to be there. Across the Channel, Duvel is reviewed at length in Roger Protz's ""300 Beers"", published by CAMRA. Roger provides good historical and technical background.  As for my review? Well, I stand on the shoulders of giants and 2,828 other reviews. The best compliment I can make is that even the one or two things that I could suggest that might improve Duvel probably should not be changed. Duvel sets such a high standard that to change Duvel will diminish the category. If any brewer matches this strong golden, I will be certain, as a Belgo-phile, that I have gone to Heaven. And if I end up going to Hell, it will not be because I loved this incorrectly named ale.  10/19/19 . To kill time pleasantly at the Sacramento airport, I was very fortunate to find a french-fry vendor with a good selection of Belgians. Stretching this copy of Duvel to fill 90 minutes helps me to appreciate it even more fully as it warms. No change in rating and minimal editing. (This rarely happens as I often make mistakes... or at least have moods.)  3/24/20 Had again. Made a few minor edits. No change in rating. An enduring ale. I'm counting my repetitions over at Untappd.  11/28/21 In the interim, I still have been counting -- and being amazed at Duvel's longevity -- over @ Untappd. But I return to note at the BA fount an important milestone: Duvel now has its tulip but inscribed on its back that this is its 150th year in business. I will try to add the photo @ Untappd.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,princessbay710,4.48,"Bright golden color with a thick frothy foam. This is probably the cleanest tasting beer I've ever had. Mild in all aspects, besides the fact that it contains a very, very well hidden 8.5%. Extremely drinkable, hints of a silky mouthfeel.

Golden hazy beautiful beer, big fluffy pillow of a head that sticks around for the entire duration of the beer. Some nice Belgian yeast on the smell, kind of like a La Fin du Monde, but much more pale. Taste is light, inoffensive, and bright. As others stated a little pepper like with the classic Belgian yeast. Carbonation is at a perfect level like champagne, not sure how it is so dialed in but the feel is incredible on this beer. A near perfect medium that succeeds in many different aspects and fails at none. Alcohol is devilishly hidden. Glad I was able to cop a few so cheap, these are expensive and I feel blessed.

It was a nice surprise. Again, a little peppery, which may be accentuated by the higher abv. A clean grainy flavor.   Feel - High volumes of co2 of course. Velvet, dry, cloudy mouthfeel.

It is a pale straw yellow, which begins clear and then the chill haze takes it. It has abundunt white head and foam, initially, but it quickly dissipates into thin and non-clingy leavings.  The aroma is all yeast up front. The flavor is full of banana-like esters, and clove notes; more yeast on the palate, but the 8.5% alcohol is well hidden. There is a short period of sweetness after sipping, but it becomes sour and then goes bitter after that.  Even still, it's a very drinkable beer.

222,695,Dravin,4.73,"Pour from a bottle into a Duvel Tulip.  Look -- A tight creamy white head with the endurance of John Henry given the ABV of this beer. Beautiful lacing and a clouded pale straw color to the beer itself.  Smell -- Fruity esters lend a banana and clove nose to the beer. No alcohol whatsoever in the nose.  Taste -- Banana and clove again, hints of bubblegum buried in there as well. Initial sweetness quickly gives way to a delightful bitterness that persists just long enough for you to take another sip. Alcohol is hidden.  Feel -- Creamy on the tongue due to the carbonation. The body is light, surprisingly so given the ABV.  Overall -- A beautiful beer. It looks good. It smells good. It tastes good. It feels good. It's the beer equivalent of sex in a glass. A wonderful brew.

222,695,Gote,4.82,"My brother in law slipped me a couple of these with the tulip glass and told me ""best beer I've ever had."" Now he knows his German and Belgian beers so I listened. The next thing I did was check out the reviews here. I get a little skeptical when something scores this well because my tastes tend to run a little differently than others. Porters and light stouts are my favorites. Anyway, I chilled them and got ready. I screwed up the pouring a little and wound up with way too much head so I had to wait a bit but it was worth it. I'll let the other guys give all the flowery evaluations of subtle notes and such and tell you that this is the ale that all other ale makers should shoot for. It's light, clean, and refreshing but somehow doesn't skimp on flavor. I don't mean that over-hopped crapped that's all the rage these days but real beer flavor. On my beer tasting list I've got a category for beers I would drink every day and this one made it.

I cannot stress how important it is to pour this beer correctly, or the suds will be quite overwhelming. Pours a light golden, with a very creamy, foamy, and thick head that does not go away. Ive seen some reviews of this beer in that it dissipates quickly and does not lace. This is because it was poured incorrectly. The lacing on this beer is extreme, almost can't see through the glass at times. The nose is very complex, a lot of deep fruit notes. First thought on the tongue, wow. So much going on here.

222,695,Back_in_the_Saddle,4.57,"This was poured into, none other, a Duvel tulip. Hey, go figure. The appearance was a hazy golden color with a finger's worth of foamy white head. While the head caves out a bit to allow a mushroom cap of a head, the dissipation picks up the pace in the wake and barely any lacing is seen. Its always a nice show to watch a Duvel head die off. The aroma takes some banana, apple, lemon and Belgian spices to tighten a grip over some Belgian sugars. To sweeten the pot, gentle sweet grassy and earthy hops slide in to balance an overall wonderful unprecedented complexity. The flavor yields a full sweetness coming from the fruity esters, and Belgian sugars colliding into the spices to build an eventful luscious aftertaste and finish. The mouthfeel is about medium bodied with a slightly sticky sort of feel. However, with that in mind, I do feel the alcohol a bit cherishing its return to my tongue. Overall, what gets me the most with this beer is that though the alcohol is noted in the feel, one can still drink this beer with its respected food.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Pours a slightly hazy, pale, golden-straw coloured body with masses of intense, fine, streaming carbonation. A huge, four-finger in height, foamy, pure white coloured head with fantastic retention, gradually sinks to a dense cap, leaving clumps of thick, sticky lacing on the glass.  On the nose, delicate, fruity esters of banana, apple, and pear as well as spicy notes of clove and pepper float above a trace of crisp, light malt. Taste follows the nose almost exactly, adding just a touch of lemon rind to the fruity and spicy flavour profile, while in the mid palate, crisp, pilsner-like malts are bolder than the aroma suggested. A gently spicy, grassy and earthy hop bitterness builds towards the finish, joined by a touch of alcohol that adds a little warmth to lingering spices. In the mouth a light body and masses of endless sparkling carbonation give a champagne-like-feel, that’s crisp, dry and refreshing from start to finish.  Overall this is a fantastic beer.

Herbal notes of grass and hay pair with lemon zest and yeast to round out the aroma.  Flavor is bursting with complex fruit flavors. Sweet lemon, banana, clove, apples, white grape juice, and too many more to try and separate individually.  The carbonation on this beer is a whirlwind of magnificence. This must be the highest level of carbonation I've ever felt in a beer. Truly refreshing. I can't think of another beer I've had that is quite like this one. And then add in the fact it's 8.5%?!!!?

This has a 3 to 4 finger thick head that is super puffy and cloud like, before eventually settling into a thick, very dense film over the beer! Lacing is simply perfect to be honest, with clumps of thick bubbles clinging to the side of my tulip glass. Carbonation looks to be fine and very lethargic in this relatively clear, super golden colored Belgian Ale!  S- There is a fruity nature about this in the aroma profile that lingers into the apple, pear and banana smells....on top of this, there is a very genuine yeasty biscuit smell that reminds me of fresh bread dough that hasn't been baked yet. Mild peppery spice notes round out the finish....a very well rounded aroma profile that goes between sweet and savory....quite nice and pleasantly unique for a golden Ale in my tastings to date!  T- The flavors are simply superb, following the aromas closely. The fruitiness of the brew really shines, and in particular the pear/apple flavors become much more prominent. The yeasty bread notes also shine through and follows through straight to the finish, which becomes just slightly dry and spiced.....clean on the palate.  M/O- Well I'd never know that this was 8.5% beer...simply delicious! The creamy nature of the carbonation and medium body make this almost dessert like and this needs nothing to accompany it. This sets the bar for golden ales in my opinion and is so highly drinkable....I'm afraid of how quickly this would catch up to one during a session.

The taste was mainly sweet, light biscuity to bready (semi-yeasty tones) slide through to balance and then has a little kick of the clove in the backseat. There's a sticky sweet aftertaste leading into a semi-dry sweet finish. The mouthfeel sat about a medium on the body with an okay sessionability about it.

Aromas of toasted grains, a spice blend of clove, all spice, grains of paradise, and nutmeg, a bready backbone, and some fruity notes, including banana, berries, and white grapes. There is also a subtle hops bitterness at the end, too. Tremendously balanced and layered aromas. Flavors are crisp and sweet forward, heavy on the fruit notes, with grape must, lemon, orange rind, and banana all making an appearance. The spice blend follows, with notes of clove, nutmeg, all spice, grains of paradise, cardamom, and pepper. All of this flavor convenes on a bready backbone. The body is full, but kept light by carbonation. The aftertaste is more bready, with the citrus fruits taking up most of the sweetness, and the spices still providing a healthy hand. The finish is smooth, effervesced, and slow, with a subtle fruit and spice linger. Great beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Also getting a grassy/earthy aroma.  Mouthfeel: Very crisp, fully carbonated, and dry finish (not too dry, just right).  Taste: Follows nose with the belgian yeast bringing that sour apple and white grape taste up front, followed by a slight citrusy/hoppy flavor. For this being a belgian pale ale, the hops are a lot more balanced with the rest of the beer than I was expecting. You could probably tell me I was drinking a tripel and my inexperienced palate wouldn't have argued.  Overall: This is far from my go-to style but I was pleasantly surprised.

Aroma: Estery fruity aroma on top, needs time to warm a bit. Grapes. Smells characteristically Belgian.

Lingering bitter/yeasty finish.  Mouthfeel: Light-to-mid-weight. Slick.  Overall: 8% is totally hidden. I can see why they named this after the devil.

Very yeast-forward; sour and tangy, with a hint of coriander-like spiciness. A good balance of sweet and bitter, although the bitter comes more from the yeast than the hops. Becomes noticeably more sharp and tangy when the yeast sediment is added. There's also a leafy and herbal hop character that reminds me of a pilsner. Finishes crisp and very dry.

I never gave it the chance because I thought it would be significantly less refreshing and never was too keen on the bottle shape. I could not be more incorrect.

The flavor is spicy with herbal/grassy bitterness, browning fruit, considerable alcohol, and some softening malty sweetness; the finish is dry and malty sweet. It is extremely carbonated with an intense bite; bubbly but crisp.  Crisp and frothy, spicy and bitter, and yet lightly sweet and fruity.

222,695,DaverCS,5,"330mL bottle poured into a Belgian glass.  Appears to be a light golden-straw color. Ample carbonation streaming from the glass with an equally generous amount of fluffy white head.  Aroma is crisp yeast. You can tell this beer will be dry and yeasty. Slight notes of grain. The yeast is obviously present and quite complex!  Taste is absolutely spectacular. This is my go to beer. In my opinion, I wouldn’t change anything about this beer. Immediately when the beer kisses your lips the carbonation grabs you and keeps you the entire sip. The beer is akin to a dry champagne with notes of yeast and light hopiness. Some nice notes of grains or wheat in the mid-palate. Really no malt to speak of. Very little hop bitterness, however, the bittering-hops that are present act to balance and add characteristic to the beer rather than being added in for the heck of it. This beer is incredibly smooth even at such a high ABV! It drinks like a 4% (be careful!). I LOVE Belgian beers, and I think this is the best example of a Belgian bottle conditioned beer. So crisp!  Overall, this is a perfect beer in my opinion. It pairs with any dish. Non-beer drinkers will love this beer as well as more veteran beer drinkers. If you are getting into beer, getting into Belgians, or just want to try an EXCELLENT beer look no further. This is why this beer receives a 100/100!!!  *** Add on 3/22/15*** I aged this beer for just over a year to see how it turned out. While very similar to the original, it has more yeastiness to the flavor and aroma. Almost a slight funk to it (not in a bad way). However, it doesn’t change enough to warrant the year of aging, but it was still fun to try!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Simply beautiful.  S- Soft spice, slight citrus (orange peel) character. Sweet malt backbone.  T- Extremely soft citrus and slightly spicy in nature. Yeasty notes in the background with a little hint of pilsner-like malt.  M- Aggressive carbonation. Definitely more carbonation than I was expecting but I suppose the notation of 'bottle conditioned' makes up for that. Smooth and creamy on the palate.  O- I can easily say that Duvel is one of the best beers that i've tried. It's not only a great looking beer, but it is a pleasure to the nose and palate. Two thumbs up.

A yeasty sweetness is paired with spices and pepper, creating a crisp, vivid mouthfeel with a refreshing and still peppery aftertaste. Complex and challenging, at first impression, the various flavors seem to collide, but they all end up in a very well composed beer with gentle sweetness and complex body.

S - First thing I pick up is fruits and spices - mainly banana and cloves. Definitely a bit of black pepper there as well. Further in the background are some flowery, almost perfume-like aromas. Distant grainy malt notes.  T - Drinking the beer the phenols are more up front then in the smell. The black pepper taste is more obvious, and also more pronounced because of the carbonation. It starts out with a fruity sweetness that lasts almost all the way through, but is cut off by a bone dry finish.  M - Light body, with very high carbonation that works to play up the more spicy tones of the beer.  O - Really tasty!

Wonderful nose of spicy Belgian yeast, banana, sweet fruit (pear with hints of orange) and subtle biscuit. Light medium body, yet nice and slick. Heavily carbonated with rich effervescent rushes throughout the profile. The flavor profile is of normal intensity, complex and balanced. The 8.5% alcohol is perfectly hidden. It begins with the fruit flavors, then flows into a light biscuit sweetness. In the middle, an effervescent light hop bitterness emerges coupled with a light note of pepper. The finish is rather clean, somewhat dry and a light bitterness lingers a bit over a blend of the previous flavors while notes of clove come to the forefront.

The first sip feels heavily carbonated and one might be tempted to wonder what all the fuss is about. However, this beer is meant to be sipped slowly. After a while, as the carbonation settles and the beer warms up the taste becomes more pronounced. As you get to the bottom of the snifter glass you feel a poignant sadness that it is all about to end. The taste is so unique; it feels like you are drinking a white wine at times. The alcoholic content is high, yet the flavor is so clean and the taste so pure, I didn't even feel a buzz.

Appearance: a 750 ml bottle brings sophistication in simple; the tulip was unable to effect the imp in the bottle, but it should be because the glass is not the brand, with laser engraved (my mother said a pebble in the background would make the effect); abundant, fleeting foam to keep enough; citrus color, translucent. Aroma: It is not unpleasant, but simple, refers to a citrus. Taste: balanced, it seemed like a champagne beer, at first I did not feel the alcohol, but it rises quickly to noggin (inset).

Extremely clear, very much like a golden pilsner.  S – Very spicy, some mild fruitiness, esters. A little bit of alcohol, a touch of something like raisins. Hay.  T – Tons of carbonation and maltiness, light toasty flavors. A bit of a dusty flavor, like an old but well-kept house. Some fruitiness from esters. Maybe a touch of lemon, and spicy, peppery notes. Some acidity in the balance.  M – Again, very highly carbonated. There’s acidity and bitterness very much up front but it is wiped out by the bubbles. Really very palate-cleansing. Dry finish, leaves you ready for the next sip.  O – Duvel’s reputation precedes it, so it’s hard to separate that out when evaluating. Luckily it lives up to the hype.

222,695,Retroman40,3.03,"For the price I paid and the number of outstanding ratings I was expecting a near life changing experience; what I got was a decent enough beer but nothing particularly stunning. Poured out a bright amber with a good thick pure white head that demonstrated excellent head retention. The smell was that of cloves with some earthiness. The taste was OK with hints of spiciness and fruitiness typical of a Belgian style, but there was very little to set it apart from any other beer of this style. The finish was actually quite plain. The mouth feel was decent enough but the carbonation level was a tad on the high side.  Overall I would much prefer a Chimay to this one especially since either one will set you back a few extra bucks. Decent enough but just not that special.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,constantine_272,3.95,"A: Poured an extremely bright golden color with a pure white head. Poured about a solid inch of foam into my old standby, the Deschutes Rastal snifter. Foam reseeded but still left a solid layer continually fed by a medium high carb. Ever so slight haze. Love the color--so vibrant and great silky texture. Only downside was the foam got a little bit sticky.  S: Big cloves, and sweet fungus and tropical fruit. Lots of mango and pineapple. Meaty mushrooms. Wet deep woods rich soil.  T: Huge floral cherry blossom and sweet light malt. Big tangy musty fruitiness comes in next. Notes of fresh bright peppercorns and a saltiness comes through. Bittering comes through with wet greens and dry golden straw which finishes nicely. Was overly musty at first, but the bottle was refrigerator temperature and needed 5 or 10 degrees more. A sweet strawberry note along with a sweet orange came in on the finish after the brew warmed a tad. Most unexpected. It also mellowed the funkiness and rounded out well.  M: Good consistency. There's enough body but still remains light and refreshing. Good clean light dry finish leaves a longer salty feeling that leaves you wanting more. This kind of detracts from the refreshing quality as it leaves a parched feeling. Weird.  O: Great beer. I think I ruined it to start with because it was too cold right out of the fridge. The musty flavor overpowered the beer at low temperature while the other flavors receded. Once it warmed up it rounded out beautifully.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Pours a bright golden honeyburst color with a tall fluffy white head that has very good retention and leaves a lot of lacing as it dissipates.  Smell is of Belgian yeast, sweet malt, and light and citrusy fruits.  Taste is of sweet malt and bitter hops up front, picking up the light fruits and citrus from there along with herbal spicyness and the 8.5% alcohol comes in to say hello. Finish is clean and dry. Mouthfeel is smooth, nicely carbonated, and almost creamy.  Overall, one of the best beers on the planet.

222,695,TheMcCollums,4.19,"As previously mentioned, the head on this beer is just beautiful, although for me it did not last as long as it seems to have for others. Pure white, fluffy, initially three fingers high but fading to one finger and then just a ring after a few minutes, although the carbonation was superb and lasted the entire time. The color of the beer is a rich golden orange in the glass. The nose on this beer is very nice and spicy, and hoppier than the flavor seems to be (until you get to the pleasant lingering tartness at the finish). This beer was challenging, in a good way, as it has so much going on. I found it much more enjoyable as it warmed a bit, since I think I served it a bit too cold initially. The flavor is yeasty and spicy, with some fruit but not too much sweetness, and a tangy bite in the finish. Would cheerfully have again...one of the best beers I have ever tried.

Mouthfeel: A fair amount of carbonation, if not an ideal amount; very fitting for a strong ale.  Overall: We all know that 'Duvel' is one of those classics that work whenever and wherever; cool summer nights or by the fireplace in the dead of winter - a true classic.

AROMA: brilliant pilsner introduction; fragrant floral, perfumed hops; some suggestions of pepper...desirable... PALATE: quick, aggressively smooth with a solid, lingering finish--a bit dry and mouth-watering... TASTE: honey and hops are warming--nectar of the gods! a bit sweet, like a Riesling--but oh so rewarding... OVERALLL: only three sips are needed to bring the tingle, not unlike your team drafting first overall for the third time in four years; as its name suggests, sadistically drinkable, tempting with crisp, clean flavor, then punishing with cruel, powerful alcoholic hammers...the steep price--literally and figuratively--is unfortunately warranted.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,BREWS4LA,4.68,"This is a classic that I revisit from time to time and I remind myself of what a true world class beer is especially in the style.  Poured in a proper Duvel glass, the head and carbonation are perfect. The lacing is about as good as it gets. The smell is just the right amount of citrus and earthy not to sweet. although a higher ABV you can't taste the alcohol so If you are having three or more don't drive right away!  This is the one that should always be in the fridge.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,FLima,3.93,"Finally decided to formally review this classic. Golden color with a thick head with decent retention and keeping a constant plate fed by its apparent carbonation and leaving lots of laces. Mild, but elegant citrusy aroma with orange-lemony tartness and hints of mint, honey, pineapple and banana. Good, but nothing compared to its Tripel hop version. Balanced and nice flavor with notes of lemon, herbal hops, mild spices, Cointreau liquor or champagne, green apples, candi sugar, Belgian yeast, banana, pineapples and pears. Dry aftertaste with a light herbal bitterness and a mild tart feeling. Light body with good carbonation. Alcohol of 8.5% abv is well hidden, even though it has a light body and a controlled sweetness. I guess this substantiates its name. Solid classic with flawless execution, it seems to be the base for so many others beers with similar style, but that may also plays against it, once it may become very much expected for high bars. That’s why the release of the Tripel hop version was essential to the brand. I may have given some extra points for its originality and tradition. Finally, I found this tastes better close to maturity date, when it is further down the road from a BSPA going towards a Tripel, with a lower sweetness and keeping a high drinkability relatively to its alcohol content.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Some breadiness and dough from the yeast. Masterful representation of the style.  T: Follows nose, and the rest of the quaff lends some sweetness (honey) lactic notes and a bit of sourness. Yields to a cinnamon/clove vibe. Very good.  M: Smooth, nothing offensive. Medium full, not cloyingly sweet not thick. Malts and yeast at ultimate finish are slightly hot. Very slight.

T - Immediately tart and refreshing, with a little citrusy tang. As the beer settles a bit a mild tropical fruit profile emerges with papaya, guava and pineapple making appearances. There's honey at the center and a little pepper on the finish. Very tasty and not even a hint of the relatively big ABV.  M - mouthfeel is not too dry, actually much wetter/sweeter than I was expecting and it sort of coats your palate for a long finish. Good, prickly Belgian style carbonation that mellows out nicely before it becomes abrasive.  Overall, there is a reason this beer is the gold standard for the style.

Lightly hazy straw/pear body with an immense merengue crown. Sticky 3-D lacing adheres to the sides perpetually, obscuring any legs.  Perfectly clean pils malt and gentle noble hops in the nose with very delicate yeast notes (a good balance between berry-like esters and hints of spice from the phenols).  Crisp winter fruit on the palate entry, followed by moderate bitterness wedded to a characterful light malt and alcohol bite. Well attenuated, dry (but not overly so) finish.  Medium-bodied, creamy, filling yet refreshing...""dangerously drinkable"" might apply here.  It seems there is little to say about an ale that is in many ways the faultless, platonic ideal of the style - although my personal tastes leave me wanting more complexity (and I prefer the tripel-hop by a substantial margin; or even some of the domestic takes on an ""Imperial Pilsner"" a style clearly influenced by Duvel).",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,SerialTicker,4.06,"This is it -- the legend. I haven't had this before despite seeing it numerous times. I was always a bit hesitant because of the $4.49 price for an 11.2oz bottle, but I bit the bullet, finally. Best before April 2015. Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint, since I don't have a Duvel tulip.  Appearance: Pale yellow with an insane amount of carbonation -- most carbonation I've ever seen in a beer. Really just looks like a champagne. Pouring slowly, I got an insane ain't-going-anywhere, fluffy white head. Plenty of lacing.  Smell: Pretty simple and light, but pleasing. The yeast (presumably) is giving off a banana sort of aroma, but it also smells of white grapes and just a little sort of spiciness.  Taste/feel: About identical to the smell. Light and refreshing banana and grape flavor, with only a slight spicy hop character with some malt. Surprisingly simple tasting, but done very, very well. The 8.5% alcohol is traceable only by a very slight warmth. Duvel has about a medium body with a pretty prickly carbonation, but not nearly as harsh as the look of the beer would suggest. Also, a dry, dry finish.  Pretty short review, but this beer doesn't need a long one. I know that Miller High Life is supposedly the ""Champagne of Beer"", but this beer should hold that title... since this beer's got a good flavor, and certainly has the look.  At $4.49 a bottle at my bottle shop, this is not something I'd revisit very often at all -- I was tip-toeing around it at the store, but finally took the plunge. Is it a good beer? Oh, without a doubt. Is it worth that price? Nope.

222,695,dougbassett,4.3,"One of the ""1001 Beers You Must Taste Before You Die"" -- #46 of the ones I've reviewed here.  Well, this one is a classic, probably the benchmark for the Belgian ""Golden Ale"" style. I think I read somewhere that a lot of the ones that came after -- Lucifer, Delirum Tremens, etc -- riffed off Duvel's name.  This is a favorite beer of mine, as well: I like Belgian Golden Ales and in this case do believe the hype, this is a standout. Although it doesn't taste a hell of a lot like other Belgian Goldens, like La Chouffre's offering, for instance. Duvel is much dryer, with a concentration of yeast and a bit of hops that linger satisfyingly at the finish. I finally, just now, realized what Belgian Goldens taste like -- or at least what Duvel tastes like. It tastes a lot like champagne, it even has a similar mouthfeel, with its pleasant lightness, it's effervescent, and it's long, tart, yeasty farewell on the palate. It doesn't smell like champagne, though, at least to my nose: it smells a little like Mead, with its honey notes sitting on top of a fair amount of yeast and alcohol.  I won't say its the best Golden out there, I haven't tried them all and if anything this is a bit atypical (dry) for the style.

ON the nose, I get lots of sweet malt and champagne-like yeast. It's very fruity, there's something peppery and some figs and dates.  Fruitiness continues on the tongue, with some raisins and figs and dark fruit flavor combined with a slight lemon zestiness. There's some sweet bread flavors to complement the fruit, although there's also a bittersweet aspect to the beer, something akin to the peel of a grapefruit.  Duvel's got a lively feel on the tongue, some effervescence and a bittersweet bite. All the while it drinks smoothly and has a lighter feel to it.  No need to state the obvious.

I figured I must be missing something if many beer experts including Michael Jackson consider this one of their favorite beers. I like many Belgian Ales and thought maybe my palette just wasn't developed enough to appreciate the subtle nuisances of this beer. Three years and over a thousand beers later I now appreciate a wide spectrum of styles and my palette has definitely advanced. Duvel however hasn't changed for me. I find that the high carbonation deters from my enjoyment, the high alcohol content which I usually find as a plus takes away from the taste. The appearance and mouthfeel are nothing special. Sometimes I feel that some beers get rated high because of the ""buzz"" over it. For example, I was at Russian River six weeks ago and had a Pliny the Elder. Good IPA not great.

Huge, luscious white head with a tornado of carbonation.  S: Sweet, crisp with some phenols. Comes together nicely.  T: Dry with a very clean, crisp finish. Slight sweetness from the abv and Belgian yeast give it the perfect amount of balance. Extremely refreshing despite abv.  M: Very effervescent, high carbonation. Makes the beer (too) easy to drink. Each sip only makes you thirstier for more.  O: This is a beer in a style all of its own and extremely unique. Extremely pale, very high carbonation, high abv, and the balance of the Duvel yeast make this beer in a league of its own. IT is also the experience of drinking it out of the proper Duvel glass that enhances it as well. We all know the best beer is more then just the beer, but the entire experience. Well done.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

T- Way overpowered by the carbonation. WAY too young to drink now.  M- Way too carbonated. Hints of yeast and mild malts are not even close to being combined yet.  O- Not bad but needs time for sure in the cellar. Will revise my rating in a couple of years.  Food Pairing  This very young effort pairs well with... Sushi.

222,695,DJLehnherr,4.49,"One of the Belgian abbey-style beers that we drink pretty often.  A golden hue, almost cloudy, with lots of foamy head. The scent is very yeasty, almost musty. The taste is much sweeter, even a little citrus-like. A lighter flavor than what you might expect, masking the 8.5% ABV.  A little hoppiness comes through on the tip of the tongue on aftertaste. Maybe even a bit of ""metallic-ness"" on the back of the tongue (like a wine aged in copper rather than oak).  Drinking the Duvel with home-made Belgian fries: perfect!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,ThePaintedGrey,4.35,"330ml bottle poured appropriately into a standard tulip.  A: A very pale golden hue with some haze provided by the yeast that pours out due to the brew's bottle conditioning. A frothy bleach white head forms as you delicately pour, and it leaves THICK patches of pure white silky lacing down the glass as it deflates to a perfectly creamy cap.  S: Clean, faint aromas reminiscent to an apple and pear orchard on a chilly day. Some alcohol spice seeps through, mixed with some fresh yeast.  T: A bit fruity at first, like the skin of a fresh-picked apple. The yeast floats through to add a bit of earthiness to it. A little bit of bitterness and alcohol spice in the finish does well to balance this one out. Complexity through simplicity. Duvel does a great job of not getting in its own way.  M: A perfect level of carbonation gives the brew a nice bite without getting in the way of the full, juicy body. I can't even begin to explain in full how this brew feels in the mouth... It's hard to wrap my head around how a brew can be as full-bodied as this, but still remain light and airy in the mouth. The 8.5% ABV obviously affects the feel, which can be off-putting for those used to lighter, more sessionable brews, but I find no negative connotations in the texture, regardless.  O: As I've been delving deeper into the world of beer, Belgian Strong Pales have been dropping farther and farther down on my list of preferred styles so, admittedly, I've been slacking on Duvel. As I sit here typing this conclusion, sipping the last few ounces, I'm metaphorically slapping myself in the face for putting this brew off for so long. You know you have something special on your hands when you're utterly dumbfounded by how good a brew is, regardless of the fact that it's a style you're not fond of. Duvel is the top of the line. It is the be-all-end-all Belgian strong pale ale. It is the gold standard in which every BSPA aspires to be. If you're looking for the definitive, look no further. Duvel is here to satisfy.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

S - Meditation. Lemon, champagne, with spices, pepper, fruit, apple, and sweet malt. It's like bubble-gum Marilyn Monroe at first, and evolves into elegant Gwenyth Paltrow. Needs a moment to let loose the sweet shoppe, and calm down into the more grassy, champagne like body it will become.  T - RISING on the tongue, with sweet malts, a little bitterness, spices. Pepper & champagne. So much going on. Such a clean long, long, cleansing finish, that makes you want another kiss, I mean sip.  M - pinpoint carbonation. Dry and crisp like champagne.

Looks amazingly refreshing. Bottle art is regal and appealing.  S: Some notes of grains like in a 'domestic beer'. Backed up by undertones of tropical fruit and spice, it turns out to be OK. Mild hop presence back there too.  T: Those same fruity notes and spice, coriander, a bit of yeastiness. Lemon rind. Grainy aftertaste. Reminds me of cheap champagne.

A steady stream of bubbles rise to the surface from the bottom of my tulip glass.  The aroma is fruity with notes of apple and pear. yeastty bread, light spice and grass are also present.  Each sip of this medium bodied beer is soft and pillowy with strong carbonation. The flavor is much like the aroma, fruity with bready malt. It begins with light fruit flavors of apple and pear. Quickly, spicy notes of white pepper or rye blend with some wheat. It finishes with some grassy bitterness and a little tartness. Once gone the apple and spice lingers on the palate.

Duvel is real juggernaut of Belgian pale ale....candi sugar and pilsner blend together boost up the alcohol % but thanks to two stage yeast additions, there comes across a clean very dry finish with glorious head retention.

222,695,PorterLambic,4.63,"Pours a hazy, straw yellow color. A voluminous white head develops from a not-so-aggressive pour. It dissipates at an expected pace, not too fast, not too slow. The result is a chunky, rocky remnant with a decent amount of lace. Smell is malty first with notes of light fruits, faint hops, a light sour/funk aspect, and yeast and straw notes. Good balance, well blended. Taste is exactly what the nose promises. Notes of malt, light fruits, yeast, straw, a light hops presence and just a whiff of sourness/funk. A fairly substantial alcohol bloom/warming is added to the rest. I like the balance a lot. Nearly full bodied with a lighter effervescence which comes across quite tart. Warming with a slight cleanliness to the finish. This brew is world class, not just in its style.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,boilermakerbrew,4.64,"A- Pours a bright, light golden in color with a giant head. Gentle pour still produced a head of at least 4 fingers. Retention and lacing are both amazing. Moderate level of haziness in the body, as to be expected with a bottle conditioned beer.  S- Light, a little esthery, and fruity. Small hints of apple and citrus with a bigger dose of pear-like scents intermingle for an enticing overall scent. Just a bit of yeasty scent towards the end.  T- Starts with light, grainy flavors consistent with a Czech pilsner. A little bit of fruitiness comes next with the apple and pear flavors being prominent again. In the middle of the drink, the beer turns toward a heavier, more yeast centered flavors. Biscuity malts and yeast mix in with some dull alcohol bitterness to finish out the drink.  M- Big carbonation and a nice, creamy feel are the headlines here. A rather light looking beer drinks more like an imperial as far as weight goes. Fairly smooth across the palate, but the alcohol in this one warms as it goes down and makes itself felt.  Overall, this is an awesome beer. I could drink this beer in a variety of beer settings; sessions, hot days, cold days, it's just a really versatile feel as far as flavors and feel goes.

222,695,Jugs_McGhee,4.04,"I've had this classic many a time before, but haven't yet reviewed it somehow (though I could swear I remember reviewing it in Holland). ""Best before: 09/2015."" 11.2 fl oz brown glass ""snub"" design glass with iconic label art and branded pry-off pressure cap acquired at a local Colorado beer store and served into a Duvel stem-tulip in me parents' gaff in high altitude Castle Rock, Colorado. Reviewed live. Expectations are high. Props to Duvel for the pouring instructions - ""Pour Unhurriedly."" 8.5% ABV confirmed per the label.  Served chilled. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.  A: No bubble show forms as it's poured.  Pours a four finger wide head of white colour. Disappointingly thin and airy. No real creaminess. Not as fluffy or soft as it should be. Head retention is good - about 5-6 minutes. No lacing clings to the sides of the glass as the head recedes.  Body colour is a translucent clear pale gold of above average vibrance. Has some yellow and copper hues. Very clean; no floating yeast particles/sediment is visible.  Overall, it's an appealing, classic appearance for a Belgian golden ale.  Sm: Starches, Belgian golden malts, clean crisp barley, floral hop character, and Belgian pale malts. Hints of vitamin-y biscuity yeast character. Sweetness seems perfect based on the aroma. Has a kiss of candi character and a faint trace of peppercorn. There's also a vague fruitiness - perhaps from the hops? As best I can tell, it's crisp ripe apple. The distinctly Belgian character of the yeast - the light fruitiness, the spiciness - is what really elevates the aroma for me.  No alcohol is detectable - a feat at 8.5%. If I smelled it blind, I'd guess it was maybe 5%. Wow.  It's an inviting, alive aroma of moderate strength.  T: Light starchiness is present, and doesn't work too well in this flavour profile. The bulk of the body is comprised of Belgian golden malts. Hop character is predominantly floral, with a kiss of fruitiness in there too - crisp apples and pears. The yeast is lightly biscuity and spicy, and definitely feels like a Belgian strain. Clean crisp barley lends it some added depth of flavour. Light clove and grassiness also make an appearance. Quite estery. Duration and intensity of flavour are average for the style.  What's amazing here is how well the beer hides its ABV; I'd never guess this was 8.5%. Dangerously downable stuff.  It's also very well balanced, and boasts some impressibe subtlety. Decent complexity. It could be more intricate and nuanced.  Mf: Could be softer. It's nicely smooth and dry, and is well-carbonated. Aptly medium-bodied, with perfect thickness given the flavour profile. Very good presence on the palate; it's almost fleetingly light - which greatly aids drinkability. Not as crisp or ripe as many beers in the style; it's a bit more subdued. Effervescent. The texture complements the taste well, but isn't quite ideal. There's room for improvement.  Not oily, gushed, harsh, hot, boozy, astringent, or rough.  Dr: Extremely drinkable - especially for the ABV. Every time I drink it, I'm shocked how quickly it disappears from my glass. Undoubtedly a classic beer in a demanding style, Duvel remains one of the beers you have to try if you're an enthusiast. It's one of the best in its class and is absolutely a style-defining beer, but I don't know that it's the best Belgian golden ale out there. Still, I could happily kill 12 of these in a night without getting tired of it and definitely plan on picking it up again in the future. I can see why it's in the top 100, but I don't know that it's amongst the best 100 beers I've had personally. What sets it apart for me isn't the taste necessarily, but more its incredibly light feel and dangerous drinkability. This is the definition of easy drinking.  Probably the best widely available beer in the world, period.  B+  *** 12/31/16:  I revisit this often, and I figured I'd add more impressions:  That's just it. ABV couldn't be better disguised, it's soft as fuck, the malt backbone is perfect, it's refreshing in spite of its ABV, the hop profile is terrific for the style...this is just great.  As drinkable as any beer could be at this ABV. What a treat.  A- / EXCELLENT",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,BeerDocT,3.79,"Received a liter bottle of Duvel for Christmas and could not believe I had yet to review this world-famous brew! Here goes... .  Poured into a chilled La Trappe goblet.  Appearance 4.5: Pours out a brilliant, light golden color. Nice 1"" head faded slowly into a 1/4"" that stuck around the entire session. Good lacing and lots and lots of little champagne-type bubbles all over the place. Just an amazing looking beer in the glass.  Smell 3.5: Very subdued nose. I detect yeast, some malt and a certain very slight hop scent. Kind of a letdown in this category.  Taste 3.75: Front is almost completely void of any taste. I do detect a slight hint of malt, but that's about it. Middle is where a pleasant and warming maltiness seeps in along with a nice feel of alcohol. Finish is slightly sweet and there is a nice taste of light Pilsner malt along with a very light hoppiness. Aftertaste was of medium length and featured more malt and a slight taste of yeast.  Mouthfeel 3.75: The mondo-carbonation made this beer very enjoyable. It certainly concealed many of the beer's defects.  Overall 4.0: Great beer, but I found it a bit off in several vital categories. Smell was far too subdued for the style and the taste was too bland and generic. I was hoping for something more ""Belgian""...i.e. a big hit of malt or hops or spicy yeast. Instead, I am left thinking that Duvel is the lager-drinker's Belgian ale. Not that this is bad. It's just that -to me-- Duvel is a bit ""dialed down"" for the international market. Again, just my opinion and this is not to say that I would not buy Duvel again, I would.

222,695,SmashPants,4.31,"Bottle: a stumpy brown 330mL bottle with aa typically Belgian label.  Appearance: poured into my St Feuillien abbey goblet. An extremely clear and crisp light yellow-amber, with sparse yet fine carbonation visible. An enormous pristine white head leaps up to an inch, and slowly recedes to a rocky finger with great, thick lacing. Looks exactly like a top-end Belgian Strong should.  Aroma: plenty of Belgian yeast aromas up front, with lemon citrus and biscuit malts.  Taste: again plenty of Belgian yeast across the flavour profile, with spices, citrus and some orchard fruits. A well-rounded, full flavoured Belgian ale.  Aftertaste: a slight warming alcohol sneaks in on the finish, with some lasting bitterness.  Mouth feel: moderate- to- heavy in body with a fairly minimal carbonation. Could possibly use a touch more carbonation as it starts to feel a touch flat after a while.  Overall: a fantastic example of a Belgian Strong Ale - there is a reason that Duvel is regarded as one of the best. The well-rounded profile makes the higher price of AU$130 a case of 24 x 330mL bottles (2013) worth it once every now and then (or perhaps a 4-pack for us peasants).",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,CalgaryFMC,4.03,"Had a bottle decanted into a genuine Duvel goblet at 1410 Bier Haus in Calgary. This classic world-renowned brew pours a lemon-drop bright yellow with the oft-cited bright white head that forms a nigh-impenetrable cap that bottlenecks right at the rim of the glass and protrudes a bit over said rim without spilling. A majestic sight. Exudes an aroma of fruity yeast and very clean pale malt, some green apple and Saaz hop perfume. Palate is quite crisp and dry but with some residual sugars and a lot of fruit: Apples, pears, and a little banana perhaps, white sugar, candied ginger, citrus pith and white pepper spice against a backdrop of floral perfumed lemon cake. A large bloom of alcohol along with noticeable Saaz hops. Finish is bitter with a little cork. Clean, without noticeably funky flavors. Hard to argue that this isn't the perfect example of the style ... It is the original after all and the intent to to yield something clean and crisp: Perhaps less complex in terms of yeast-derived spicy ester profile than some similar beers.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,fourstringer,4.43,"Poured from a cork & caged 750 mL bottle into a Duvel tulip. Gentle hand. I've had this many times, but never reviewed. Dated 06/07/15.  A: Hazy golden yellow with 3 fingers of rocky, white head. Great retention and leaves icebergs of residual foam floating around. Moderate lacing. Fine looking brew.  S: Tropical fruit and banana. The belgian yeast is there for sure, but a bit more integrated than typical. Orange. Lemon. Apple. Pear. Light spice. Really great.  T: Spicy yeast & fruit up front with a mild malty sweetness that gives way to a fine noble hop type bitterness. Fairly dry finish, although the fruitiness lingers and makes it seems a bit sweeter than it would otherwise. Alcohol is noticeable, but appropriate and actually adds to the whole experience.  M: High carbonation with a relatively light body. A bit prickly and a touch filling. Not quite my cup of tea.  O: So after you've had a beer a number of times, you start to take it for granted. Glad I took the time to review this one, pick it apart and remember how good it is. Well balanced with great scents and flavors. A bit fizzy for my preferences, but overall very solid. Consistent as well. Great stuff.  Prost!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

M- So light, it caught me off guard. Carbonation was alive and sharp. Dry finish with a slight peppery burn.

Top notch beer. Lacing is rediculis down the glass. Pilsner malt is very up front and well placed. Dry finish. I would describe this beer as a slightly sour super pilsner. I am impressed.

I always take a spoon (or a finger) and try some of the froth before drinking. The texture is buttery, slightly acidic and with just the right amount of carbonation for this style. While high in alcoholic content, the floral aromas and delicate flavors cloud the ABV.....so much that trouble can ensue if one is not careful. Slight notes of apple and stronger notes of orange emerge, especially if this classic is not served too cold.

It is a beer you want to take your time to enjoy as it boasts a 8.5 abv. As well it has a very fine fruity flavor to it, the amout of foam that comes with this drink is something I didn't care for, but the taste made up for it.

Almost like a toned down saison. Alcohol is hardly evident.  m: Light to moderate. Pretty good body for the light color.  o: About what one would expect of a good ""Belgian golden ale."" Quite drinkable with enough yeasty fruity zing to keep it interesting. I get the feeling I'm drinking it in the wrong season though, it would probably be a very fine summer refresher.

I have never given a rating of 5 on appearance...until now.  SMELL: very sweet, champagne, white grapes, pears, apples, banana, lemon. very complex.  TASTE: the taste follows the nose. it reminds me of sweet champagne. there is a lot going on here. The Belgians really like this beer and now I know why. the 8.5% alcohol is nearly imperceptible. bubbly and dry with white grapes, pears apples, banana and lemon. it's not overly hoppy but I don't care, everything is in balance and it works.  PALATE: light body, highly carbonated with dry finish.  OVERALL: I truly enjoyed this beer.

A - As expected well over an inch of pillow like head atop of a bright clear golden ale. Well done. S - Smell has a bit of a boozy bite but also balanced with a touch of white grape, fruity and dry yeasts, and a bit of hops. T - Sweet than bitter and finishes a bit dry but it drinks pretty good. Especially with food. Mild musty grapes meet some sweet malts and a bit of earthy dry hops. M - ABV is well hidden it drinks like 7% but this one is almost like a triple but well masked boozy aspect.

Very ""shapely"" on top, and left a bit of lacing on the glass.  S - Belgium malts up front, in a big way. Also detected booze early which suprised me, as at 8.5% ABV it's not THAT strong of a beer. Lot's of dark fruit noticeable, especially figs and grapes. Certainly smells like a Belgian ale.  T - All the aromas were noted in the taste, with the exception of the booze. Extremely smooth and the malts are absolutely killer. Dark fruits weren't quite as noticeable in the taste. Really not a ton going on, but the malt is excellent. An excellent representation of a Belgian ale.  F - Smooth and crisp, just a tad on the thick side. Certainly drinkable and easy on the stomach.  O - Took me a while to try this, not really sure why. I'm not the biggest fan of Belgian ales, but this along w/ a few of the Unibroue Belgians are outstanding representation of the styles. I really like the malt in this brew, and the dark fruit isn't as noticeable in this one, which is good. I think the dark fruit in some Belgians can make the beer wine-like, which I do not care for.

222,695,joe1510,4.44,"750ml $6.99 Sam's Downers Grove  Duvel. Pours a crystal clear straw golden. I can't remember seeing another Belgian beer as clear as this. An enormous fluffy airy white head forms and sticks like meringue. A glassful of swirling carbonation bubbles rise to keep the head going strong. Leaves the ""Belgian lacing"" after each and every sip.  Smell starts off heavy on the biscuity malts but they're quickly pushed aside by an abundance of fruitiness. Lemon zest, pear skin, and granny smith apple tartness. Solid clove yeastiness with a hint of alcohol toward the back. Complex deep aromas. The aromas continue to evolve as the beer warms.  So many different flavors are present in this beer and all of them dovetail together perfectly. Biscuity and doughy to get things going. Quickly overtaken by fruit, yeast, and mild hoppiness. Pear skins and apples, clove and a grassy hop finish. I can't even put into words the spectrum of flavors in this ale and it keeps growing as it warms.  When I first started drinking this I thought the mouthfeel should be just a little bit lighter but as I drink on it actually does seem to get a little lighter. Airy with solid carbonation that awakens the tongue for the complexities it's about to expierence.  It's another one of those dangerously drinkable brews. No alcohol in the flavor (except for a little spiciness), so this one could easily sneak up on you.  Duvel is a classic for a good reason. A hard brew to compete with and in a league of it's own.

Taste - A good balance of spice, light citrus and just a hint of delicious, delicious booze. There's probably more going on here, but this is a seriously well balanced beer. Nothing stands much more than anything else, but it still manages to be pretty intense. Lots of hop bitterness, lots of yeast, lots of alcohol.  Mouthfeel - Don't generally have much to say about mouthfeel. But this is something else. High carbonation makes for a crisp finish.

222,695,BethanyB,4.34,"Appearance: A beady, snow white head sinks quickly, but never completely dissipates. The color is a pale yellow. Clarity is somewhat hazy.  Smell: Apple and citrus esters are backed by wisps of clove-like phenols. A faint spicy hop aroma is present. As is true to style, malt aromas are restrained. Altogether, the aroma is surprisingly soft for a beer of this weight.  Taste: Fruity and spicy esters continue to dominate. Alcohol warmth is immediately apparent, as is mild hop bitterness, which is well-balanced by toasty malt. The bitterness and alcohol warmth are experienced through the finish, but neither are overpowering. The dense combination of flavors is both complex and round, creating an exemplary showcase of the many possible flavors produced by pale-colored beers.  Mouthfeel: Medium mouthfeel and high carbonation ensure the effervescent finish that is typical for this style. Also both present and typical is the slight dryness from hop bitterness and carbonation.  Overall: Although somewhat light on the nose and a bit ""iffy"" in terms of appearance, the taste serves as a paradigm for beers.

Taste: A huge lemon sour power bomb, with a scooping dose of yeast that might be overwhelming for some. I like it's unique sourness almost like a rye bread topped with the right sprinkle of ground black pepper.

T: Pretty stanky with a big hop bite (borders on a medicinal bitterness in the back of your throat). Musty dirt flavors with a bready backbone. The malt balances the bitterness so that neither is the most prevalent flavor. Fabulous!  M: Pretty light body. Great carbonation. Creamy but sparkling, lingering but clean. Exactly how it should be.  O: Excellent beer in every way. Likely worthy of a straight five rating across the board (I like to think there is a white whale out there somewhere, though).

Bottle conditioned and as this is the 3rd of the 3, all have been slightly different -this the most funky of the bunch. Pours dark gold, thick head fades fairly quickly. Aroma has a slightly stale moldy essence. There is a twang to it, like budweiser with corriander dryhopped. And that is exactly it -an upscale, and expensive bud that has gone bad.

Banana comes through with the yeast notes. The finish is aggressively bitter. The hops offer nothing in flavor but really hold this ale up for the finish.  M - HOT. Very carbonated. Slight 'slick' mouth feel.  O - I think my sample may have had a hard life in its journey between the brewer and my glass.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,ryan1788a5,4.32,"11.2oz bottle poured into a duvel tulip.  A: Brilliantly clear lemon yellow. Massive rocky white head retains very well at an impressive four fingers. Foamy clumps of lacing stubbornly grip the glass.  S: Pilsner malt lends soft bready and biscuit aromas and that bit of trademark sweetness. Yeast is distinctly Belgian. Chalky earth, very slightly clovey and medicinal, subtle white pepper. Hops lend grassy tones with a bitter herbal component. A perfect display of balance and what I will call 'simple complexity'.  T: Pilsner malt leads off with its distinctly sweetish breast and biscuit taste. A hefty dose of grassy and herbal European hops is a perfect foil to the malt base. Peppery and spicy yeast, lightly chalky too. High attenuation means this beer is very dry overall. Hop bitterness rules the back end and grabs the most attention on the finish, though some yeasty spice contributes too.  M: Light in body. Stiff bast of scrubbing carbonation. Creamy and airy. Very smooth.  O: This is one of the all time greats, a classic for the ages. An absolute must-try. There really isn't much to think about if you really dissect this beer, but its greatness is derived from its perfect balance and legendary drinkability.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,utopiajane,4.51,"Pours sparkling and with champagne effervescence and brilliant clarity. Light straw color, gold, with a terrific head of white foam that sat on top and fell slowly to patterned lacing. Picturesque. The nose is splendid. Fruity with apple and some yeasty spice. Pear, white grape, pepper and clove. Light pale malt underneath fresh grass and a touch of musty earth for depth. Taste is elegant and light. Fruit and spice perfectly matched with a light grain malt that tickled the palate with the sensation of bubbles as the flavors flourish. The body of the beer is soft and creamy, bright and animated. Grassy notes and earth add depth and it sports a touch of white grape to remind one of champagne not only in looks but in taste and in a sparkling dry finish.  Fruits engage the palate and the sour makes the mouth water. The light grain malt sways and bends across the tongue for a feeling that is light and refreshing. The champagne bubbles tickle you and the dry finish is complimentary. There is a touch more alcohol than you might at first realize and that is ticklish too and makes you smile as it warms you. The pear comes out more and the grainy malt starts fluffy but then deepens slightly to remind you of a still life painting with fruit and bread and cheese. This is a work of art. Radiant and pleasing to the senses. Captivating.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,Kuaff,4.38,"Poured from a 750 mL bottle into my snifter at cellar temperature.  Duvel has a head is like no other head I've ever seen. It's like the head has a mind of it's own (pun intended), as it forms a four-finger-plus mountain of firm, white foam which rises well over the rim of the glass, yet somehow doesn't overflow. Over the next 10 to 20 minutes, it proceeds to meld into a variety of strange shapes which vary each time I have this beer. Also, clumps of foam stick tenaciously to the top of my snifter long after the main mass has died down. The body is a bright golden straw color that is clear at first, but it gets hazy as one's refills reach deeper toward the bottom of the bottle, which is how your senses will start to feel at that point from the deceptively high alcohol content.  The smell is of sweet white bread, resiny green grapes, and tart granny smith apple. A nice combination.  Tastes yeasty! The fruity tartness from the smell is here too, reminding me a bit of white wine. But this is a beer. The hops make that clear. There are definitely a subtle hops taste and bitterness, though it's a different kind of hoppiness than what an IPA has. I believe these are what people call ""noble hops."" They are indeed refined, but I prefer to call them ""aristocratic hops."" No trace of alcohol, by the way.  The carbonation is high, but it's not as carbonated as the humongous head woulda made me think. It feels light, crisp, and sprightly.  Duvel may be standard-setting as a Belgian strong pale ale, but it's also unique. Easily my favorite European beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Yeast in the nose and some bread. Some faint hints of Brett.  Extremely crisp. Sharp bite on the tongue. No alcohol notes come through initially. More light bread and biscuity notes. Did I mention the carbonation yet? Well it just brings everything together. Amazing. Some slight sour notes but really the dry finish is where this hits home.

222,695,JerzDevl2000,4.15,"Picked up this beer at Top Hops, having never tried this before. Although it packed quite a punch, this was a great Belgian Strong Pale Ale once I was able to get past the sweetness in the taste and the booze that was the undercurrent beneath everything else. It was never overtly present and the beautiful appearance and complex light fruit flavors hid it well, leading to the ""Devil"" in this beer that eventually made its presence felt!  The pour to this was wonderful, as the golden hue, strong head, and sheets of lacing combined for a pleasing effect. I even swirled in the yeast on the bottom, as it slowly settled into the beer like the downdraft during a thunderstorm. The aroma could have been a bit stronger, as the alcohol and sugar combined for a acrid sharpness. They weren't as strong in the taste, as apple, pear, grass, straw, and clove could all be felt in sip after sip. Banana and bubblegum were in the back as this almost reminded me of a Witbier as the aftertaste set in. This was too strong and without the wheat but the appearance and notes of that style were enough to take this beyond a typical Belgian Strong Pale Ale.  That stylistic moniker was appropriate for this, as this was quite strong and took a while to fully enjoy and savor. Because the carbonation was so persistent and easily discerned, this felt like a champagne squared by the time I finished it off. Although this isn't a type of beer that I prefer, there's no doubt that this is the standard by with all other beers of this style are measured up against. Dancing with the Devil may not be for everyone but all beer lovers out to give this a try to see if they're up for handling it , since this is one brew that deserves a try by all.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,StoutHunter,4.28,"I picked up a bottle of Duvel a couple weeks ago for $4.29 at The Lager Mill. I have never had this beer before, I have always wanted to try it but the price put me off a little, but I decided it was time to try it, so lets see how it goes. Best before 02 2015. Poured from a stuby Belgian 11.2oz brown bottle into a Belgian tulip.  A- The label looks good, it's got a nice clean and classic look to it, I like it. It poured a slightly hazy pale straw yellow color that took on a bight golden yellow hue when held to the light with four fingers worth of rocky and fluffy white head that died down to a thin layer that stayed till the end and it left tons of lacing behind. This is a very good looking beer, it's pretty close to being perfect, I really like it.  S- The aroma starts off with a medium amount of sweetness followed by a nice citrus rind aroma with lemons seeming to stick out the most followed by lots of grassy, hay, earthy, and straw like aromas that are followed by a slight bit of biscuit malts. Up next I get some spicy yeast with cloves seeming to stick out the most followed by some lighter tart aromas towards the end. This beer had a pretty good aroma that I thought was very true to style, I enjoyed it.  T- The taste seems to be very similar to the aroma and it starts off with a medium amount of sweetness followed by a Some nice bready and slight biscuit like malts followed by some citrus rind with lemon still stickint out the most, it's similar to lemon grass and it's followed by some grassy, earthy, and straw like flavors with some banana flavors that are a little on the lighter side and are followed by some spicy yeast with cloves still sticking out the most. On the finish there's a lighter amount of bitterness with just a little bit of tartness to go with it, with an earthy, grassy, and citrus rind like aftertaste. This beer taste pretty good, it was very true to style and the flavors were very well balanced, I enjoyed it.  M- Smooth, crisp, refreshing, a little dry, medium bodied, with a higher amount of carbonation that was pretty prickly. The mouthfeel was pretty good, the higher prickly carbonation worked really nice with this beer.  Overall I thought this was a very nice beer and a very good example of the style, I've had more than of a few of this style and this beer seems to do the best job at showing what this style is really about and all the aspects of it seems to be balanced nicely. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, refreshing, not filling, and the flavors did a great job at holding my attention, it would be nice to drink a few of these during the summer, but the price prevents me from doing so. What I liked the most about this beer was how true to style and balanced it was and the appearance was also very good. What I liked the least about this beer was the price, it's a very high quality beer, but I still don't think it's worth the price, that's the only downfall with this beer. I would buy this beer again, but it wouldn't be often because of it's price, this would have to be a once in a while beer. I recommend this to anyone who likes Belgian Pale Ales, it's a very good and true example of the style. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, I had some higher expectations for this beer since it's highly regarded and it met my expectations nicely and I think this beer gets all the respect it deserves. It made for a good fist impression and I will be on the look out for some different Duvel beers, great job guys. So far there is no doubt that is my favorite Belgian Strong Pale Ale.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

It has to be one of the worst Belgians I’ve ever tasted. It struck me immediately as skunkorama–a la Beck’s.  It did taste quite a bit better when drunk later while eating--with some spicy shrimp and grits. They tended to mask the skunk.

222,695,estlinska,4.54,"Poured from a bottle to a large tulip glass at The Pantry on 4/16/13. The beer pours a glossy yellow-gold like very fine jewelry with an eruption of rocky white head. The head retains for most of the life of the glass of beer and leaves streaks of fine lacing all over the glass. The light penetration is pretty good, though there is a little haze from the pour. The nose on this beer is phenomenal and by far the highlight of the beer. There is hoards of bright fruit notes and esters that seem to jump out of the glass. At first you are hit with lots of ripe banana peel and candied sugar drops. There is a good spicy hop aroma that lingers along as well. As the beer warms a little and you give it a nice swirm, bright and fresh lemons come out as well. The malt is present too with a little soft bready smell as well. The 8.5% alcohol is nowhere on the nose. The taste is also quite good with fresh fruit, especially golden raisins, dates, and a touch of maybe some cherries as well. I tend to think of the cherry flavor in sour beers, but this is more of the sweet side of the cherry flavor. The hops are present, earthy and spicy, very much like a noble hopped beer. The mouthfeel was a little overly-dry, almost like something produced from a champagne yeast (though I have no clue if it is used in this brew), but otherwise has great body to it. The alcohol, at 8.5% is impressively well hidden. I never even got any sort of burn from it. Overall, this beer is fantastically well done.

Very well balanced and complex. Difficulty picking out individual flavors. Despite the high(ish) ABV, the alcohol flavor really fades into the background beautifully. Not at all unlike a tripel, but with the flavors more balanced, less pronounced. Bright and forward, but not particularly hoppy; certainly not bitter. Mildly spicy, and lovely malts.  M - Lovely. Swishes like a medium-bodied ale, but clings with a lovely finish in the mouth.  O - This is one of the better beers I have tried. More complex than my limited palate can truly appreciate.

I get some ripe bananas, come clove, and some mild earthiness in the middle. As the beer transitions to the finish, the sweet malt dominate.  M: Light bodied beer. Sweet and spice play off each other in great balance up front. The beer coats the palate, but slides off smoothly. It's a bit sticky in the back end but dries up once the beer is gone.

Flavor reveals a fairly sweet malt backbone, accented well by bananas, corn, and lightly toasted bread. Notes of caramel emerge. Peaches and tangerines underlie the profile, which finishes fairly dry, peppery, and a touch bitter. Yeastiness is evident throughout. Buttery notes provide an impression of richness.  Body is on the full side, rich, smooth and a little syrupy, but fairly high carbonation prevents it from being cloying. Alcohol warmth is substantial.

The beer is simultaneously filling and refreshing as it masks its alcohol content with ease. Flavors include pilsner malt, Belgian yeast and its byproducts, dried hay, and satisfying hop bitterness.  Pours a 2.5cm head of small, white bubbles, which gradually coalesce into larger bubbles, giving the appearance of a white sponge, as the head very slowly breaks down to a thick lacing atop the body of the beer. Lacing is very good, thick washes in a variety of patterns adorn the insides of the glass. The body itself is a transparent golden color, with light bringing out bright yellow hues. Carbonation is quite active and plentiful, rising from the bottom of the glass.  Aroma is crisp, fairly clean, and primarily light and sweet. The pieces are of pilsner malt, light lemon, pineapple, lightly flowery European hops, and Belgian yeast byproducts. Good, though I perhaps enjoyed De Proef's take on the style more, which included a bit of one or more Brettanomyces strains to increase fruit-like esters and add further complexity.  Note: I don't recommend adding the yeast, despite the desire to see what it's like. It simply seems to dilute the aromas/flavors.  Front of palate is of bright, somewhat sweet pilsner malts with a pleasant spiciness from hop usage. Mid-palate is where the full flavors appear, like a strong Belgian pilsner. I find sweet pilsner malt that's been bittered substantially by European hops, with additional characters of dried hay, slightly medicinal phenols, and granny smith apple. Back of palate finds sharp bitterness, slight ethanol, and sweetish malts. Aftertaste is of lingering pilsner malt with slight graininess, sharp bitterness, and Belgian yeast notes.  Beer is medium bodied with medium-high levels of carbonation. The resulting mouthfeel is slightly fizzy, but quickly becoming smooth and foamy. Closes quite dry, somewhat astringent, with little residual stickiness lingering across the palate.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,DenverLogan,3.95,"From a corked bottle into a mid-size Duvel tulip glass. Modest cork pop. Pours a clear light yellow with big initial head. Aroma of hay, powder sugar, candy sugar, light spice. Medium carbonation and mouthfeel. Flavors of rich malts, white and black pepper, funky fruit rind, light honey, spicy esters from the yeast., field straw hops. A big and bold beer that makes me think of a Stella Artois gone wild with mild steroids and minerals, a touch of spice and challenging yeast. I can't say how many decades I've been tasting this brew, but it's many. The brew has changed over the years, and a corked bottle can be quite different from draft or small bottles (or the huge bottles). Generally respectable and gotta love the new marketing effort with designer glasses.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Slyguy,4.97,"I honestly could not describe this ale in a way that is sufficient to acknoledge the exceptional taste of this beer.  This beer have a very rich and sharp taste that cannot be compared to anything else, it is the standard of the belgium ales and maintains the top place of most beer advocates.  The substantial head and odour immediately draw you in and the first taste, you will realize how much you have missed. I could not recommend a better brew than this impressive ale from this Belgium brewery.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Groomsy,4.41,"Bomber poured into a tulip glass.  This renowned ale pours a dark, clear golden color and is topped by a head of two fingers, consisting of bright white foam that leaves walls of lacing all over the glass. Carbonation jets from the bottom of the glass, and the beer stays lively through all the drinking. Excellent looking stuff.  Duvel's nose is somewhat faint, but what's there is excellent. Compared to the only other Belgian strong pale I've had (Delirium Tremens), I would say this lies more on the spicy/alcoholic end. There's some grainy/biscuity maltiness in there too, but predominantly, I get spices and some alcohol with some fruity esters (apple and clove?) in the background. Subtle, but incredibly enticing.  Oh sweet Moses, the taste on this bad boy. With a somewhat aggressive spicy/herbal note from the hops, this beer asserts itself on the palate at first, only to smooth out with bready malt and some slightly fruity yeast on the finish. Some characteristics of green apple and clove come to mind, specifically. Some alcohol bite comes in the finish, but it's well-disguised by the other taste characteristics. This is a very refreshing drink, surprisingly so for the ABV, but it is robust enough to be qualified as a sipper.  Duvel's mouthfeel is what makes is somewhat... dangerous. This does NOT drink like a beer at 8.5% ABV. Its crisp body and aggressive carbonation remind one more of a pilsner rather than a strong ale. The dry finish also has a tendency to make you want another drink, but be wary - drink this one slowly to savor it.  There's not much for me to say that hasn't been said. Duvel is a great beer and is worth checking out, even moreso since it's widely available. Best enjoyed with contemplating the deeper things of life, such as R.W. Emerson's essay, ""The American Scholar"" (my personal choice). Absolutely a great beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Wrigfen,4.91,"Poured great in a chilled glass, served cold. Hazy golden color with a rich thick foamy head. Dynamite tasting beer. I am not good with words, so I would just recommend you buy some and try it yourself. Small bottle gives it a neat look but cuts by of 12 ounces by .8 but gets away with it in my book by it's great taste and nice alchol content. If more affordable I would drink it more frequently. Hope you enjoy some.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,TheMultiYeast,4.05,"Cork pops off with ease, beer pours clear pale golden yellow with a glacier of white head and clumpy lacing.  Fruity yeast and apples dominate aroma. Juicy fruit, gummy candy, skunk, esters, banana, tinge of alcohol, leafy hops, cereal grain.  Lightly sweet grains again in check with dominant yeast. Overly ripened fruits, mealy pear, welcomed alcohol, quick hit of bitterness as yeast flavors fade. Smooth ester aftertaste.  Body could be the best part of this beer. Feel is nearly burning with carbonation. Substantial, just big enough, satisfying.  Any beer lover should try Duvel. Go on...",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,WaringYouOut,4.02,"A - The pour is a hazy medium yellow, big head, small lacing S - Strong yeast with sweet overtones T - First taste is incredibly full and sweet, reminiscent of bananas. Herbs include mostly clove with a bit of nutmeg and vanilla M - medium-light, a bit creamy towards the end, lots of lively carbonation O - On tap, the beer lives up to the hype. I find that in the bottle, the first impact is a bit too heavy; give the beer a bit of time to breathe before partaking. When possible, find on tap, the effect is much better. By far one of my top choices among the Belgian beers. I prefer on tap a bit on the chilled side. Once warmed, the sweet flavored really stand out to the point where it's almost overpowering - a bit strong for my taste.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,DWatson,2.86,"Appearance and aroma similar to what a lot of guys on here have already said, but I wasn't crazy about the taste.

222,695,TheSixthRing,4.17,"Appearance - Pours a hazy straw yellow color with a massive, pillowy 3 finger head. Good retention. A nice layer of bubbles remain on the surface, thickening around the edges. Lacing is spotty with good stick.  Smell - Sweet, sugary and fruity esters dominate the aroma. Green apple, subtle touches of unripened banana, slight spice.  Taste - Follows the aroma. Green apple sourness upfront, smooths out with estery sweetness by mid-taste, allowing a touch of clove spice to shine through. Mild grass bitterness hits near the finish, before a clean, crisp aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - Medium in body, with lively carbonation. Entirely smooth and inviting; almost creamy on the tongue. Crisp, clean, semi-dry finish.  Overall - Really beautifully crafted beer. Wonderful flavor, combined with a fantastically drinkable smoothness makes this a joy to drink. My only drawback? The price. At $3.50 for an 11.2 oz bottle, it's nothing I'll be buying with much frequency.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,FlatRabbitRed,4,"If you like Belgian beers this one holds up pretty good, had three different ones tonight, and this one fits the bill.  Belgian beers have this fruity Honey twang to them followed by a slight bittering after taste. They are definitely in a class by themselves! I drank this one ""Golden Ale""right after a Atomium ""Grand Cru"" ...and you know what, they were pretty much the same thing ...to me anyway. I noticed a difference in the triple and that was that it had three times the flavor!  The review before this one said it tasted like a Heineken ...

M - Medium bodied with medium carbonation.  O - I'm sorry, but this beer is so unbelievably overrated that it is ridiculous. IN MY OPINION, It tastes like a glorified Euro Pale Lager. I love how I'm seeing people review this beer noting it's flavors which compare quite well to adjuncts, Yet they are rating it so highly simply because they feel obligated and they are completely biased. i deliberated this beer with two friends, Both craft drinkers. One of them has been drinking craft only for over twenty years and they both completely agree that this beer does not live up to any of the hype.

222,695,lacqueredmouse,4.09,"This may be the most famous beer I've not gotten around to reviewing. I do remember probably trying it for the first time at a Belgian Beer tasting many years ago, when the concept of a beer over 5% ABV was unknown to me. Needless to say it was a messy night. This is a 330ml stubby Belgian bottle purchased from Dan Murphy's in Alexandria.  Pours a clear, effervescent golden colour, with a frothy, crackling head of white fed by that effusive and exuberant carbonation. Lace forms as patches of bubbles left behind. body is very light, certainly not 8.5%'s worth of residual sugar sitting around in this baby. Overall, it's refined and sophisticated.  Nose is spicy but crisp. Some phenolic characters come through, along with some apple skin, wine barrels, a little vanilla and some white pepper. Dusty, earthy tones are also noticeable. The vanilla becomes more prominent as it's warmed, and the phenols and detection of booze subsides. Nice stuff.  Taste is clean and bright, with a long palate that stays fluid and light throughout. Alcohol is well hidden, just a slight upturn of those phenolic characters on the finish. As it warms, sweeter notes come through as well. More of that vanilla aroma, along with some banana esters and a hint of marzipan. Very tasty, but always subdued and pulled along into that all-encompassing cleanness.  Feel is very light and smooth. It really shouldn't be any other way.  Yes, dangerously light and drinkable, and exceptionally refined. This is a very well made strong Belgian ale, and a worthy canonical example.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

A lot going on with this beer.  M - Light with TONS of carbonation. Very champagney and crisp.  This is about as perfect a Belgian golden ale as you're going to (easily) get.

Smell: yeasty, some bananas, bread, slight hint of fresh mowed grass, some herbs, and even some mint. Later on some hint of lemon. It's all quite fresh, but very complex.  Taste: starts with yeast, very light malts, toast. Then some citrus (lemon) with a nice bitter touch of hops, alsmost like lemonpeel. Aftertaste is slightly sour and fades into more bitterness. Slighty less complex than the nose, but wow I really like this a lot.  Mouth: quite dry and medium bodied. Perfect carbonation. This feels light for the ABV, but it really works very well. Love it.

Light bodied, highly carbonated, very light sweetness, dry.  I had never tried this beer before and although it's not my usual hop-bomb type of brew, I decided to delve in with a 4 pack anyway. The first bottle I thought was just OK...By the last of the 4 pack I begrudgingly came to this realization...this is one of th finest easy drinking, alcohol hiding, delicious beers I have ever had.

222,695,emyers,4.53,"11.2 oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass. Best before 05/2014.  Appearance: Crystal clear pale gold with a huge fluffy white head. The head drops to about a quarter inch within a minute and then holds. Leaves a nice lacing down the glass.  Smell: Bursting with fruity, estery aromas. Really accentuates the Belgian yeast well. There's a bit of tartness to the smell, almost a sour green-apple, along with some clove. The smell is very clean despite all of the esters.  Taste: Similar yeast-dominated flavor profile. Very fruity, with the same subtle tartness that I picked up in the aroma. A little bit of bready maly balances out the yeast, but it's barely apparent beneath all of the yeast character. Once again, I'm extremely impressed by how clean the flavor profile is - I often find Belgians come off a bit messy due to too much going on with the yeast, but this is perfectly crisp and clean.  Moughtfeel: Light, very dry, extraordinarily crisp. Very thirst-quenching and near-impossible to put down.  Overall: I'll admit the Belgian pale ales are not near the top of my list of favorite styles, but this is simply a flawless beer. Extremely flavorful, quite complex, yet very clean. Similar to champagne in many ways (although I'd take Duvel over most any champagne in a heartbeat).",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

T - A very clean, dry, peppery taste. Somewhat tart apple, very yeasty, and a slight hint of clove on the end. Possibly a little bit of sweet grape as well.  M - Moderate body with massive carbonation. The beer is super prickly in the mouth, and just assaults the tastebuds with its yeasty tartness.

222,695,Chrysostom,4.3,"A: Pale golden colour, with a slight bit of cloudiness. Poured from an 11.2 fl oz stubby bottle in to a Chimay chalice, because that's what I was using for my St Bernardus, and I forgot to switch to my Duvel tulip. It looks the same in both glasses. Large, two-finger head even in chalice (leaves 3-4 finger head in tulip), which recedes slowly, leaving heavy lacing and a mountain of thick-yet-light foam in the shape of a cone in the middle of the beer. In two words, the head is MASSIVE and ROCKY.  S: The chalice has adversely affected the smell on this, in the sense that it is lighter and not as pungent as it is when it is served in a Duvel tulip. It has an alcoholic Pilsener smell, with reminiscences of what you wish malt liquor tasted like, and a pronounced smell of both pepper(?) and Yoder's or Helluva Good ground horseradish with vinegar (i.e. the kind of condiment you buy prepared to slather on Kielbasa or other Polish sausage). Spicy hops (dry-hopping?) jump out of the glass. There are subdued undertones of Belgian yeast and biscuity bread  The carbonation veritably jumps out of the glass, so it also has a ""tingly"" smell. The 8.5% ABV is noticeable in the aroma, although it's mostly covered by the pepper and horseradish.  T: Spicy, alcoholic Pilsener with horseradish and white pepper with undertones of citrus. Right off the bat, you can taste (and feel) the hop bite - quite a change from my normal Dark Belgians and Trappists. It's a bit bitter and astringent, although not very hoppy: I think the bitterness comes from the alcohol. There is also a smell of funky Belgian yeast in there, although not as funky, nor within 100 miles as being as strong as that in a Belgian Strong Dark/Quadrupel Ale. The malt is subdued, the hops are present and accounted for, There's a bitter, puckering, incredibly clean (cleaning?) sensation as the beer exits the mouth. There's a sweet-and-sour aftertaste, much more pleasant than, but akin to, an American macro lager or Stella Artois after Emeril Lagasse ""kicked it up a notch"".  M: Carbonation, and carbonation. It adds to the bitterness and astringency. A dryness and carbonation which, combined, finish more like Champagne (especially Moet et Chandon White Star) than most beers, something I've found is common with quite a few Belgians.  D: Very high, considering the very light and airy taste for 8.1% ABV.  O: This beer is expansive in the mouth, and contracts on the finish. I don't know of a better way to put it, except for using spacial terms. If you've not had it, try it. A solid 4, maybe a bit higher. For the style, it's a 5.0, but I've never had any other Belgian Strong Pale Ales to compare it to, so I'm going off of my personal taste, which tends towards maltier and heavier beers, such as Trappists, Porters, and Stouts (""a meal in a glass""). For those who like lighter, hoppier, spicier, airier beers (as compared to the malty denseness of my favourites) this will be ranked more highly - but it's a delicious beer even for my unaccustomed taste buds. I generally buy a 4-pack of this whenever I head to the package store to replenish my supply of good beer every week or so. (Damn, I spend $150 on beer a week. Damn. I'll have to do something about that. Maybe Miller High Life? or cheap liquor?)  I'm judging much on personal taste, and not-so-much judging based on the style alone. There goes my BJCP certification.  Food pairings: Kielbasa jumps to mind as ideal - and food pairings rarely occur to me. I often have to use the internet to pair beers and meals. Secondarily, fare such as sauerkraut and bratwurst come to mind: German pub fare or Oktoberfest staples.  Cheers.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Hints of banana and cloves with just the faintest notes of earth and stone fruit rounding it out. Alcohol is hidden masterfully.  Flavor profile is quite carbonated, which is pleasant because it isn't a 'sharp' or off-putting carbonation. Buttery and oily mouthfeel that coats the palate and leads to a long, dry finish.

Appearance - Pours a light straw yellow color with an absolutely, ridiculously massive soapy white four finger head that never really fully dissipates, always leaving some sort of head on top of the beer. Clings to the side of the glass like glue. One of the best presentations I've ever seen out of any beer style.  Smell - The yeastiness and breads are certainly present, along with a lot of different lighter fruits such as apples, white grapes, etc. Kind of smells like white wine in a sense. Very good on the nose.  Taste - Tastes like God loves you. The fruity esters sweep the palate and are followed by the crackers and breads towards the middle of the drink. A touch of bitter hoppy, a bit of pepper, very well balanced.  Mouthfeel - Big carbonation, light body, so smooth and easy to drink. I smashed the whole bottle by myself in short order, and besides the good feelings I had, I easily could have drank a lot more. Finishes just a touch bitter and with a hint of alcohol warmth.

It also has this apple cider-type flavor amongst all the flavors. The bitterness is very mild.  M: Light bodied, and the carbonation draws out the flavors. The carbonation really makes this beer stand out.  O: This is a perfect beer. It's very tasty and refreshing. It's a really good Belgian Golden.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,JohnnyMc,4.94,"A classic example of the style!  Pours out a clear, bright yellow with about 3 fingers of a very fluffy, white head.  The aroma is packed with fruity esters. There are notes of bananas, apples, pears and white grapes, some lemon zest, orange peel, coriander, the typical Belgian yeast strain and some bready, yeasty notes.  The taste is very similar to the aroma. Up front there are a ton of the bananas, apples, pears and white grapes which is followed by lemon zest, some white pepper, orange peel as well as coriander. The Belgian yeast strain is very dominant and it finishes with a decent amount of bready/yeasty notes.  Finishes very dry, has a crisp and clean mouthfeel, a light-medium body and is carbonated like champagne. Not trace of alcohol anywhere in this beer. Very smooth and highly drinkable.  If you like Belgian Ales you HAVE to try this one. Amazing.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,KYGunner,4,"The single most carbonated ale I have ever seen the rush of bubbles created a telescopic off white head. The more the bubbles rushed to the surface the farther the head retreated from the top of the glass. The ale had a cloudy golden hue that was quite striking.  The scent is of yeast, cloves, honey and even a bit of lemon. Very complex.  A kind of mead like quality the taste is like a Bit O' Honey candy. There is an apple taste at the back and I'm impressed with the variance on the tongue. There's even a bit of citrus somewhere in there but it is lost quickly.  Despite the immense carbonation the feel is light and tangy. Very smooth it drinks easy and well.  These are not my favorite flavors, especially in beer, but I understand the high numbers this ale receives as it is very intricate in its tones.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

The nose is sharp with Belgian yeast, sour citrus, dry grass, coriander.  This one starts out really spritzy and a bit harsh. A massive amount of carbonation on the palate. Thankfully, though, this smooths out as I sip. Gets much more mellow and cleans itself up. A bit dry on the finish.  Wonderful balance on this one. Completely understand now why this one is rated so highly. Spice, tart yeast, lemon zest, dry crackers. Just a touch of alcohol rounds this one out. Man this is incredibly balanced! Nothing really overpowers here, but every flavor plays their part and adds to the whole. A spectacular beer.  This is a style I don't drink very often as I haven't had many that I really crave, but this one jumped to the top of this list.

A constant flow of carbonation bubbles feed a head that persists forever and making pouring 12 oz into a pint glass impossible in one attempt. The aroma on this is quite unique. Apple cider and pears along with a bready yeasty aroma are quite inviting. Bits of pepper and spice round out the nose quite well. The flavor is crisp and just a hint of sugary sweet with a heavy does of apple and light fruits. Light hints of pepper and other yeast derived flavors balance this quite nicely.

222,695,JMScowcroft,4.63,"First off I love the categorization for this beer, listed as a Belgian Strong Pale Ale, I would call it a ""Belgian Strong Golden Pale Ale"", there's nothing quite like it. Snagged one of these in a corked 1pt 9.4oz bottle, which is usually a sign of great things to come. In this case it definitely was.  Look - Impressive bottle and artwork, not much more to say here. Pours light and slightly hazy with an aggressively bubbly head. Golden with a slight touch of amber.  Smell - Resembles a high-end pilsner here, a little bitter smelling. Made my mouth water.  Taste - Crisp, citrus (lemon? apple?) with just the right amount of hop overtones. Almost spicy and zesty, incredible!  Mouthfeel - This brew is so refreshing and thirst-quenching. It made a cold January evening feel like mid-summer. Could drink for a while but it is strong so take it easy!  Overall - This is a terrific brew, met all of my expectations and shattered them. Disclaimer, I am a huge fan of golden-style ales in general so this taste may not line up with yours, but for me this is one of the best of this style I have ever had.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Tomhet,4.55,"Pours a slightly clear yellow, rife with rising carbonation bubbles rising at high speed. A one-finger eggshell-white head sits atop the body and slowly dissipates, leaving cascading lacing. Aroma is out of this world. You're first hit with some crisp, citrusy hops ala lemon zest, some pines, and a faint trace of spiciness. Some bready malt backbone to the scent can be detected, but it's not exactly at the forefront.  Taste is simultaneously refreshing and complex. Straight up on the tongue is a crisp citrusy lemon note; incredibly balanced with some yeast notes. Plunge a little deeper and there's a delicious green apple note that is more than welcomed. Other citrusy notes combine perfectly with the yeast and create a miasma of flavor. Mouthfeel is slick, wet, and infinitely refreshing all the way through the finish. This reputation is well-deserved.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,bkrebs,4.5,"750mL bottle for a New Year's toast.  Pours a clear, light golden color with a full bright white cap of foam that persists. Plenty of lace on the glass throughout the tasting.  The aroma is dominated by black peppery phenols with a low underlying pear fruitiness and a slight grainy pils malt aroma.  The flavor is mostly peppery phenols with a touch of that pear fruitiness. Some noble type spicy hop flavor comes through later with a hint of grainy pils malt. The bitterness is rather firm and enhanced by the almost complete lack of sugar sweetness. The aftertaste is lingering phenols and light noble hop flavor. I don't get any sense that this beer is 8.5% alcohol.  A rather firm bitterness and high carbonation level enhances the bone dry mouthfeel.  In many ways, this beer exemplifies the basic qualities of the best belgian beers. It's dry, with pleasant phenols and fruitiness, and it's shockingly easy to drink considering the relatively high alcohol content.  Truly a classic and highly recommended.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,JamesMN,3.88,"Appearance: Translucent golden hue with a strong stream of effervescence rising from the bottom. Huge four finger white foamy head. Leaving great lacing.  Aroma: Bready grain and yeast. Some apple and fruit juice notes. A 'dry' aroma.  Taste: I'd attribute most of the flavor here to the yeast. Fruit notes of pear and apple paired with spices. The malt bill seems almost simplistic as to let the yeast's flavors shine through. A little bit of biscuit malt flavor. There's some bitterness in there but not really noticeable. Finishes dry. Wouldn't guess it's as high as 8.5% ABV, although there is a nice warmth in the back of the throat after a while. Nice aftertaste of apple cider.  Mouthfeel: Medium body but feels lighter due to the high carbonation. Almost below average drinkability because of the drying effect on the palate.  Final Thoughts: I'm not blown away but it is definitely a great example of the style with no off-flavors. Would I drink it again? Sure.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Thick and creamy like meringue, it holds it's form to the last drop with about as much lacing as I've ever seen. Excellent presentation from start to finish. A solid 5.  S - Aroma can best be described as a subtle blend of grapefruit, lemon grass, and malt. With the high alcohol content I expected something very different....something overpowering. The smell of alcohol is masked very well and the overall bouquet comes across as very layered and refreshing. Very fine!  T - Again, refreshing and complex. Slight citrus notes, toasted grains, and then a subtle warmth to the finish. Hops are not overwhelming but are very well balanced with the rest of the brew. Again, the high alcohol content is masked well but is present none the less....this is not a bad thing.  M - Smooth bodied and lightly carbonated like an ale even though it looks a lot like a pilsner. Goes down easy.  O - As they say....""the Devil is in the details"" and this one is finely detailed! About as complex a brew as I've ever had. All aspects are in tune and finely crafted. I really enjoyed this beer but found the price hard to swallow at $12.99 for a bomber.

222,695,tectactoe,4.3,"Pours a pale, golden-straw color with a humongous, pillowy white head that lasts for an incredible amount of time and leaves decent lacing. This is truly a great looking beer, and you'll be getting a foam-mustache when you take a sip for almost the entirety of the brew.  The aroma is strong fruity esters, banana, pears, apple skins - crisp and refreshing tone. Light clove spice and bubblegum is present, thanks to the Belgian yeast strain, although it isn't overdone or overpowering. Some light hops on the nose, grassy, dry, musky. I love the clashing between mildly tart and a bit spicy; it works well together and is executed nicely here.  The taste is certainly no slouch - Duvel often gets pegged as one of the quintessential BSPAs, and it's hard to disagree with that upon tasting it. A combination of pears, apple skins, bananas, cloves, gum, yeast, breadiness, and light hops all hit your taste buds at once, in seemingly perfect harmony. The initial sweetness from the malts is never too high, but always inviting as it slowly turns into a light hop bitterness by the end of the sip.  Crisp and light on the mouth feel, high carbonation almost causes the beer to evaporate in your mouth while just the flavors remain intact. Alcohol does nothing more than provide a slight warming background, and even then, it's only really noticeable as the beer warms up - very impressive despite being 8.5% ABV.  Duvel is a great example of the style, and it's certainly the beer you want to start off with when introducing someone new to BSPAs. All around, it contains the flavors you expect from a Belgian ale, but handles them in a nearly perfect way. Don't pass this one up, you'll be sorry you did.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Bottle best by date reads 1/2015.  A: Upon first crack of the cap, a nice fizzy hiss lets out with obvious CO2 giving off. Poured into a Dollar Store wine glass (closest thing that came to a Duvel glass) and was amazed by the seemingly champagne-like appearance. Lots of carbonation with a nice 3/4 inch white fluffy head that never seems to leave. The foam from the rim seems to never want to leave the glass. Beer was clear until I decided to dump the last dregs of the bottle into my glass just to make sure I got to drink every last drop.  S: Lemon, coriander, orange. Lots of fruity & citrus esters. Smells like a thirst quencher or a new flavor that Gatorade should come up with (consider that: Duvel flavored Gatorade!).  T: Again with the lemon, orange, and coriander. Lots of upfront hop bitterness and a sharp bite from the high amount of carbonation - makes the tip of the tongue tingle. Seems like the ""true"" champagne of beers! Wheat and clean pilsner flavors also come through. I also get some fresh soft white doughy bread.  M: Seems light in feel with high carbonation & ample bitterness to balance the Belgian yeast character.  O: No way does this beer even seem like 8.5% ABV.

Hard to tell if its a hop thing, but likely a yeast thing. Subtle pepper, clove, maltiness. Alcohol is present, but unobtrusive. Incredible to have such a smooth drinking beer that comes in at 8.5% abv.  If it wasn't so expensive, I'd drink it all the time. It's the kind of beer that has you plowed drunk before you even realize what happened. Super drinkable.

222,695,BradtheGreat7,4.23,"A brew I've had many times over. This specific review was taken from notes mid summer-2012.  330ml brown Belgian style stubby bottle poured into a duvel tulip glass. Duvel has an elegant and classy white base label with Brilliant gold and devil red writing.  A - Semi cloudy straw color. Almost a glowing light golden color that sits beneath a frothy snow white head that's quite impressive. Slowly dissolves into a fluffy ring of lace.  S - fruity esters and hop spiciness That's all very citrus like. Remarkable Belgian yeast aroma.  T - Fruity notes of orange, apricots, and a good dose of lighter fruit esters. This belgian yeast strains are top notch in Duvel's flavor. Bready yeast pairs well with hints of biscuit malt. Hop notes are earthy in character providing a decent amount of spice in front of a dry finish.  M - fairly light medium body which is surprising reading the abv. It's a fairly easy drinking brew and very enjoyable. It's a bit of a hard mouthfeel at first given the alcohol spice, but settles quickly after for an enjoyable Belgian ale. Complex in the mouth.  O - Duvel is a pure Belgian classic. It's worth seeking out many times over. It's an incredibly well crafted ale from one of the most technological breweries on the planet. Read up on the methods and complexity it takes to brew this ale and you'll want to show your appreciation with buying a bottle.

A nice coudiness after the pour, man does this look good.  Smell. The smell has some fruit and yeast with a touch of spice in the back ground.  Taste. It has a crisp slightly spiscy tast with some alcohol present on the finish. It is very balanced and easy to drink.  Mouthfeel. It has a light body with decent carbonation.

222,695,mick303,4.23,"Poured from 330 ml bottle, colour is a light pale gold, with a large fluffy head that shows excellent retention and lacing. Active carbonation.  Smell is of crisp malt, a solid tart yeasty component, lot of dry mineral and musty esters. Some black pepper. Very fresh and interesting.  Taste has a solid fruity malt base with so definite citrus rind, Apples, grapefruit, underripe stone-fruit. Bitterness is moderate. Some dry yeast in the back with a nice complexity of grassy, mineral notes. Lovely with a dry, refreshing complexity. Finish is crisp, dry, lingeringly malty.  Mouthfeel has a lot of carbonation, bubbly and a very crisp refreshing body to it. Highly drinkable.  Really nice stuff, highly refreshing. Drinks insanely well for the ABV, and carries a nice complexity and flavour profile. Highly crisp and big on flavour, mostly dry malt and tart fruit.

222,695,KKB,4.68,"A – Just gorgeous. As good looking a beer as I have ever seen. A lovely gold/champagne color with a tall crisply white head, excellent retention, great lacing, incredible carbonation. Perfect.  S – A beautiful tart smell that combines apples and pears, a slight and musky hoppiness and an abundance of a yeasty smell as well. Just wonderful.  T – Oooohhh my good gosh. Glory be to Betsy. That is just so good. It’s perfect. It’s exactly what I had hoped for. Compulsively drinkable, tons of flavor, it’s like a dream on your taste buds. Sweet and tart pears, a lovely citrus lemon flavor and an intoxicating spicy/peppery/clovey yeast. Ahhh, so good. There is certainly some alcohol in the flavor but it is ingrained so well that it only contributes to the flavor and without it this beer would be lessened in its glory. So good.  M – The mouthfeel is beyond perfect. It’s a dream, a cloud, the carbonation makes it so light and airy and yet it lingers on the tongue. Highly carbonated, astonishingly drinkable.  O – This is one of my favorite beers of all time. It’s just so so drinkable, I don’t even want to put it down. It only gets better as it warms. It’s a mistake to drink this too cold too.

Straw yellow pour, clear and pale, a finger or two of foamy white head that recedes to a thin layer of bubbles; decent lacing. Pale malts in the nose, fruit esters, yeast, leafy hops. Similar taste, brready malts, Belgian yeast, apples, pears, light citrus twinge, grassy, leafy, bitter and can lean towards metallic. Medium body, medium carbonation, somewhat drying, and a boozy kick.

It has everything a true beer lover is looking for when you are rating it, however as a beer drinker, I can not say I am thrilled for one reason and one reason only: the aftertaste gave me the impression of synthetics; I immediately thought of perfume, which was odd. It tastes like a cross between a pilsner and a belgium witbier.  However, as far as presentation, absolutely crystal clear and beautiful head that would make anyone cry. It had a crisp and clean initial taste and is truly beautiful, which is why it still rated a 4.5 in my book.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Mavigo,4.85,"Wowzers. Indulged this beer in a goblet.  A: Pours a cloudy golden honey color, with a very bubbly quarter inch white head that lasts a few minutes before dissipating leaving foamy, airy remnants on the edges of the glass, never really seen a head like this, reminds me of bath bubble soap. It's contrasted with lower amounts of lacing, though there is quite some patchwork. Very pretty for having such a light color.  S: Smells delicate, honey, can pick up on its sweetness, very grainy, strong wheat smell, like bread, smells yeasty too, tinge of hops, herbs, spices.  T: Very sweet, very balanced, its really carbonated too, but its so sweet, has a good citrus flavor, for having a higher ABV, can barely taste it, its amazing. Picking up malt flavors, little bit of hops, interesting yeast flavor and texture, kind of reminds me of pizza dough. Got a twang from the spices, herbs and hops as well.  M: Super carbonated, but its amazing, its so well balanced, the flavors totally block out the over carbonation and booze too, I would not know this was 8.5% if it wasn't specified on the bottle. Has almost no aftertaste too. Props for the equilibrium of carbonation, alcohol and flavor. Carbonation usually bothers me, but there's no way I could disagree with this beer.  O: The best beer I've ever had hands down, an amazing mixture of complexity and sweetness contrasted against super carbonation leaves with a super crisp and fulfilling feel. If there's a beer you should try, it would be this one, It's extraordinary, it's the best beer I've ever had.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,RoZnstyle,2.95,Was waiting a long time to try this beer and all I'm left with I'm dissapoinent.  Appearance - pale yellow somewhat cloudy with a lot of head  Smell - bread and yeast dominate the smell.  Taste - it starts out more like a sparking wine then finishes more like a triple.  Mouthfeel - high carbonation. Too much for a beer like this in my opinion. Not as 'chewy' as I expected.  Overall - for the cost I have had many Ales that would blow the doors off Duvel. For 15.00/4 pack I'm expecting much more.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Crisp and refreshing pils bill with notes of crackers, french bread, mildly tart and citrusy hops balance, lots more Belgian yeast notes here again including black licorice.

222,695,Goblinmunkey7,4.13,"Appearance: Lively carbonation on a very slightly hazed bright-straw/light-gold colored beer. Head is massive, bubbly, creamy, bright-white, and has great retention. Big fluffy cap and collar. Nice notches of lacing.  Smell: Belgian yeast up front. Minor spiciness coupled with grass, some touches of earthy and hay, and a bright pale malt sweetness. Some hints of banana and alcohol as well. Some apple flesh and pear. Very bright and clean. Some nice floral elements as well.  Taste: Big powdery yeast drops some minor spiciness. Nice layer or ripe banana, Belgian spice, and grass/earth. Minor floral hopping. Malts are pale, slightly sweet, and dry. Very clean. Nice herbal component as well. Alcohol starts on the hidden side, but as the beer warms, it jumps out and becomes distracting. Apples and pears. Lots of flavor that blends well. Some phenols as it warms.  Mouthfeel: Medium-light body with a lively carbonation. Slightly dry. Bubbly and clean.  Overall: Classic.  Despite my general dislike of Belgian yeast, this is a good beer. A true benchmark for the style, and the bar it sets is extremely high. Incredibly drinkable with enough flavor to be memorable.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

The head produced was beautiful; 2-fingers, stark white foamy looking like meringue and held extremely well – the best appearance of a beer I have seen.  The nose is of light fruit, and light spicy hops. The flavor is richer and fuller than the nose, starting out with a light sweetness then mid-way becoming dry with light spicy hops that finishes with a light lingering bitterness. The body is light/medium with fine and effervescent carbonation that is smooth in the mouth.

Mostly Belgian yeast, but there's so much more: apples, pears, bananas, citrus, clove, sweetness, sourness, hops. It's all there.  T- Everything mentioned in the smell applies to the taste. There's just little nip from the alcohol at the end, but I find that to be a positive thing.  M- The body is pretty light, but tons of carbonation fill your mouth with lively bubbles.

Spiced estery flavors with a golden malt flavor and yeasty top notes on the tongue. Medium bitterness that carries a slight bite.  The light body is a bit drying with a smooth tongue-feel but the high carbonation tends to lift those flavors off the tongue.  Overall golden pale ale that is trying to be somewhat complex but still maintains the style in a straight forward manner.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,claspada,3.61,"Pours a hazy straw color with a foamy whipped egg white head that persists well and thoroughly laces the chalice  Aromas begin with lemon and yeasty funk that dominate but there is a subtle candy sugar/honey sweetness that emerges as it warms.  The tastes begin with the same yeast driven tangy lemon and sourish apple flavors which is then greeted by a sweet element likely from some candy sugar additions. Crackery pilsner makes emerge more as it warms with some light grassy Saaz hops that are a nice complement.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium-high carbonation. Finish is mainly light and effervescent with warming alcohol emerging more as it warms.  Overall while this is a classic example of the style, it is also a forgettable one. A bit too yeasty and one-dimentional that really doesn't invite you to consume more. The hop and alcohol add a slightly biting finish.

222,695,Darkmagus82,3.68,"Poured from bottle into tulip glass  Appearance – Pours a lighter golden color with a huge thick white head and a light haze. The head has a great level of retention, but it eventually fades to leaves some very nice lacing.  Smell - The aroma is heaviest of a pepper, yeast, and banana smells. Mixed with these aromas are notes of a citrus and biscuit smell as well as some aromas of an herbal and grassy nature.  Taste – The taste begins with a combination of a biscuit and sour but lightly sweet citrus taste. As the taste advances the sour and slightly drier flavors up front are met with notes of yeast. Accompanied by the yeast are flavors of banana and a light peppery taste. Toward the end of the taste some other spice flavors as well as a lightly herbal hop flavor comes to the tongue to leave a rather dry but smooth flavor on the tongue.  Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the lighter side for an ABV of 8.5 % with a carbonation level that is on the higher side. The lighter body and carbonation are rather fitting for the more sour flavors of the brew, with the lighter body only accentuating the very drinkable nature of the brew.  Overall - A very delicious and drier but quite flavorful Belgian. Renowned for a reason.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,RussBecker1,3.52,"Poured from a bottle to a pint glass.  A-Just as advertised. A Belgian golden ale with a lot of carbonation and a thick white head. The body is not much to behold however as it pours a clear fizzy yellow. Not that I was expecting a deep complex look, but the golden ale is what it is and nothing more.  S-Belgian yeasts are very apparent which are inherently complex. A touch of sweetness, mainly a light honey, cuts between the harsher animalistic undertones. Aside from the yeast, the malts are very apparent, but they are neither overpowering nor all that complimentary.  M-Much creamier than I would have thought. Creates a nice coating that makes the beer feel much denser and more complex than perhaps it really is.  T-Classically Belgian with malts and yeast cascading over one another. They blend nicely, but the flavors rush off the palate too quickly for my taste as the aftertaste is rather bland and mysteriously non existent.  O- Admittedly, Duvel was good but it did not sit as well with my palate than clearly it has with the majority of other drinkers. It was fine, but perhaps a good number of the complexities were lost on my palate leaving me disappointed overall.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Dennoman,3.66,"2012 bottle straight from the brewery. Had a couple of these at a good friend's party yesterday.  A: Your penultimate sexy Belgian blonde. Poured aggressively with a huge white head, this beer just looks a million dollars with its golden color and condensation on the glass when served ice cold, as it should be.  S: Typical ""beery"" smells, with a good hop character and supporting malts.  T: Hops and malts, very straight forward. This is great for when you just feel like a beer without citrus, coffee, white oak, chillies or any of those fiddlesticks.  M: Huge fizzy, stingy carbonation. Clearly not to anyone's taste. 10% of the time spent drinking this beer actually involves drinking, the other 90% is belching and apologizing for said gastrical eruptions.  O: It beer. It good. Probably my oldest love and the first beer I actually remember liking. I don't always drink fancy barrel-aged stuff, and when I don't, just give me a few of these and I'm a very happy camper.

Gorgeous presentation, truly a clear golden beer, living up to their claim of looking like a rich pilsner.  Smell: green apples and pepper yeast.  Taste: crisp big smack of zesty citrus at the start--this beer hits you big--with a thick, bitter honey in the middle, and then a lingering sour tangerine rind at the end. Lots of layers, yet still clean and crisp. Only hint of its actual 8.5 ABV is in the ""tangerine honey"" middle.  Mouthfeel: literally like champagne. I'm honestly a little thrown off here...this beer really feels like high quality champagne...the assault of tiny bubbles on the tongue and mouth are strong...they really sizzle on the tongue. Mouthfeel is a much bigger part of this beer than most others...the best word I can come up with is ""zesty"".  Overall: This is a wonderful enigma of a beer...bold, crisp, and refreshing at the front end, yet layered in complexity with plenty of alcohol for anyone.

A bit of spice is also present.  T - Initial tartness has elements of spice and lemon. The belgian yeast gives this a tangy taste. The finish seemed to be sweeter and tasted like sugary fruit.  M - Very easy drinker and perfect to sit back and enjoy. Feels light for the style and ABV. Slight carbonation, but overall a very smooth belgian ale.  O - An iconic belgian pale.

Huge, fluffy, meringue like with superb retention and excellent lacing.  S- Not as fruity as I remeber but still spicy with some hop notes and then that distincttive Belgian yeast fruitiness.  T- Dry and clean with some spice and fruit. The Pilsener malt really shines and gives way to a dry, crisp finish.  M- So smooth for a beer with this much carbonation.

A - Very cloudy, to the point that I could probably see someone else on the other side of a pint of Guinness than on the other side of a pint of this. Almost looks like a wheat beer. Majestic head - like cumulonimbus storm clouds.  S - Sour, malty, fruity.  T - Delicious - a tangy sort of malt flavor with a nice surprise finish of bitterness (not a hoppy IPA bitterness but a German pilsner style bitterness - actually good in other words)  M - Perfect. Not too carbonated.  Overall - Really really satisfying - this is what beer is meant to taste like. Blows most out of the water.

222,695,LambicPentameter,4.77,"Poured ""unhurriedly"" from a 750 mL bottle with the classic champagne cork etched with hop leaves. Poured into 15 oz tulip glass. Bottle stamped with 'enjoy by' date of 8/1/2015.  Appearance - A vibrant straw-colored hue with plenty of transparency to allow the light to pass through, creating shadows and bringing the yellow to life. Signature carbonation bubbles drift to the top from the etching on the bottom of the glass. Head is frothy and rich and clings to the side of the glass as it slowly dissipates and is the first clue that, while this beer may have a similar color to your classic American pilsner, that is where the similarity ends.  Smell - Hints of freshly cut hay and an almost imperceptible hint of barnyard funk, like you'd expect from a Saison. The barnyard aromas give way to fruity esters and hints of flower petals. Promise of freshly-baked bread.  Taste - Here is where this beer shines. The nose is crisp and has a pleasant bite of alcohol, but rounds out into a bready, yeasty finish, again hinting at barnyard funk. Again, notes of light fruits with subtle tartness, but not full-on citrus.  Mouthfeel - The floral and bready undertones linger well after the beer has been swallow. Just enough of a lining on the mouth to entice that next sip or full-on swig.  Overall one of my favorite beers; I've been known to down entire 750 mL bottles of the stuff before I even realize it's gone. Clean enough to be accessible to even those who don't necessarily prefer the Belgian style of brewing, but also so quintessentially ""Belgian"". You can taste the flavors from the unique yeast strain that make Duvel it's own beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,ThisWangsChung,4.45,"Taking a break from Augustfest for now. 11.2 oz bottle poured into a Duvel tulip, because the beer police would take me away otherwise.  A: Pours a golden color with moderate clarity. This has some of the most intense looking carbonation I've ever seen in a beer, as scores of bubbles rise up to the top. The head is a one finger white color with fantastic retention and texturing.  S: Aside from the light, pilsner-y malts, there's a pleasant layer of noble hops, and of course, the typical fruity Belgian yeast. Quite enjoyable to smell.  T: Fruity esters to start, before smoothing out into crackery, bready malts in the midtaste. The finish is lightly hoppy and yeasty, even a bit biscuity. Not quite as complex as I hoped, simply because it seems to eschew a little (but not all) complexity for increased drinkability, but it's still an enjoyable drink that doesn't come across as being anywhere near 8.5%.  M: No surprises here - this has very strong carbonation, almost too strong. Carbonation issues aside, this has a great feel, with a good blend between alcohol concealment/integration and crisp lightness.  O: I've mentioned before I'm not the biggest Belgian ale fan, simply because I find them too bloaty and overcarbonated; this does a decent job of not falling into those pratfalls. A very sophisticated yet easy to drink beer that every BA needs to have at least once in their lifetime. Having said that, it wasn't quite the masterpiece I expected it to be.  EDIT: After letting my third bottle decant before serving, I can now say it is as good as I initially expected, and as such, will bump up scores accordingly. It features this amazing citrusy note (both in the aroma and flavor) that's damn near orgasmic, and it feels even lighter and more refreshing on the palate.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,edeee,4.59,"I just had a Duvel last night for the second time while at Euclid Hall, an atypical bar & kitchen in Denver. It is the best tasting beer that I've ever had, light, with tons of flavor. I like my beer high in alcohol, not to dark in color, not to bitter in taste, and not to heavy (as far as filling you up goes). This beer hit the mark for me on every level, with a super powerful intricate taste and sweet notes from beginning to end, absolutely amazing. Being a 'non-beer drinker for a while', mainly because I hate the taste of 'schwag' (bud light, pbr, coors light, etc..) beer so much, and that's all that my friends ever offer me. You can call me a beer drinker now, after having a good beer for the first time in a long time. Anyways, I decided to go online and see where I can buy this brand and I came across this website. I enjoyed this Duvel so much that I decided to join the website and write a review before going out to buy the beer.

This beer pours a hazy straw with generous amounts of fluffy and foamy white head. The head drops about 1/4 finger per minute and leaves behind nice lacing.  S. The smell is clean with a strong citrus, apple, and earth aromas. Very intriguing and not a typical beer aroma; very lagery.  T. The flavor hits the tongue and then dances around from the top, to the side, to the roof of the mouth, and then finally to the rear. A very sharp flavor of apple, citrus and pepper? and maybe some pineapple. Very unique.  M. This is a light bodied beer with quite the punch. Light and smooth on the tongue with little sticking around for the afterparty. Only a slight burn from the alcohol in the end.  This isn't my style of beer but it is definitely one of those that hits you and its the only beer that will suffice.

Bread and some citrus, plus nectarine and banana. Similar to the nose, but more yeast and spice.  M - Light and as-crisp-as-can-be. Sharp and stings the tongue a little in just the right way.

T: This brew tastes of well cooked bread, with a sweet almost fruity taste. This taste is controlled with slight hints of a spicy earthy taste. M: A strange mouth-feel that is nothing but delightful. The carbonation level is somewhat high but the slightly thick mouth feel really brings this beer into perfect equilibrium. O: This is one of my favorite beers, if it is not my favorite it is definitely one of my favorite imports.

It really wants to stick to the side of the glass. Smells like fruit- banana, spice, sweetness and light booze. Really balanced taste- sweetness and alcohol, spice and light and dark fruit. Some significant caramelly taste. Exquisitely carbonated, very active but the actual feel of the beer is somewhat syrupy. This was freezer cold to start with and warmed up quickly due to it being in the 90s but curiously I only noticed the syrupiness after it warmed a bit.

222,695,Philousa,4.75,"Pours a clear, pale gold with a big, billowy white head. The foam settles over time and creates irregular patterns on the glass. Aroma is sweet with Belgian pale malt, honey, and a hint of pepper and coriander or other light spices. The pale malt is really the showcase here, as it becomes more prominent as it warms. A big bouquet of bready malt and spicy yeast bursts from the suds. Flavors start sweet and go tart, flirting with metallic, coppery, before going bitter. The bitterness is a mix of malt and hops, as I get the pungent Belgian malt and the flowery, somewhat musky hops. I'm guessing of the noble variety. It starts very dry when sweet, but balances out towards the finish, although it is towards the dry end of the spectrum. The feel is very balanced as well. At times I thought it was watery, but then thought it was heavier on the tongue. I guess waffling between the two suggests this is about as balanced as you can get.  What can I say? This is Duvel, the epitome of Belgian pale beers. It's complex, it's thirst quenching, it's spicy and exotic. I could drink this all day, whether it's summer or winter. It's a great beer I will be going back to for years to come.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,dbell23,5,Poured Into a tulip glass from the stubby 11.2 oz bottle. Freshness date of 11 2014. Let it sit for a minute or so (that's self control) and the head that was at the top of the glass grew to about an inch above it. Looks like a golden lager with a meringue on top. To say there is lacing is an understatement. It seems to coat the glass as you drink it.  Smell is fruity sweet tart with yeast. All Belgium beer.  The tast is sublime. Perfect malt hop balance. Very complex.  Mouthfeel is perfect as well. Crisp with a smooth finish.  Overall this is by far one of the best beers on the planet.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Adundant lacing as the head recedes. The aroma of Belgian yeast, alcohol, and a touch of ripe fruit. Opens with yeast, grassy hops, and a pleasant accent of alcohol, a touch of juicy ripe fruit midpalate, and a crisp, clean finish. Adundant effervescent carbonation, however still smooth with just the right touch of creaminess. This brew is the standard for Belgian strong pale ales.

222,695,thecheapies,4.28,"Best before 09/2014. Poured into a St. Bernardus goblet.  Mammoth fluffy white head with a crystalline bubbling effect at the surface wearing on a hazy honeyed gold color. Slabs of lace coating and layering about the walls of the glass. Epic-looking beer.  Big bursting yeast note filling up the nose with tart lemon, apple, chewy crumb bread, wet hay, and white grape juice. Faint, but stern, hop element with a spicy tone. Coupling that with a subtle booze note makes for a wonderfully potent aroma.  Bready and spicy with dusty pepper and light coriander notes. Smarting smack from the alcohol denotes clout. Fermented lemon rind and floral notes grace the palate amidst other fruity esters. Banana/clove, pineapple, quinine, and pear also make appearances.  Full and starch-thick for the style. Medium-to-high carbonation with a satisfying feel. Booze is a cross to bear.  Exceptional beer. Astounding complexity and a big drink in itself. Most people would say something like ""I don't get back to this one often enough."" I would agree with that.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Auraan,4.68,"Poured a gorgeous cloudy yellow with a three finger fluffy white head that kept expanding for minutes after the pour. Truly a gorgeous beer. Scents of barnyard funk, sour notes, lemon zest, cirtus, and very slight bit of banana. A complex nose, predicting the flavor to come, and being quite appealing on it's own. Taste is complex, with flavors of pilnser malt, citrus, fruitiness, graininess, moderate hop bitterness, spiciness and a bit of malt sweetness. The finish is dry as is the aftertaste. There is also a flavor in the after taste that reminds me of burnt marshmallows. There is a lot going on in the flavor, it's quite complex and combines in an excellent way. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A good, easy to drink and refreshing mouthfeel, hiding the ABV quite well. Overall this is an excellent beer. It has a complex nose and flavor, it looks fantastic, it has a wonderful, fluffy head and an excellent mouthfeel. I enjoy it now far more than I did a year ago when I first tried it. Duvel is truly a world class beer and well worth drinking.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Jeffo,3.58,"I can't believe how many times I've had this beer but still haven't reviewed it. Plenty of people have done it before me I guess, so there's nothing lost in my procrastinating.  From a bottle into a La Chouffe glass Best before November 2014  APPEARANCE: Pours a huge, four finger, loose looking, fluffy, bright white head with good retention. Slightly hazy, straw yellow in color with medium levels of carbonation. Head fades to a foam cap and leaves some chunky lacing down the sides of the glass. A good wisp remains and leaves some nice lacing the whole way. Head is a little thin for me, but this is good looking and fits the style.  SMELL: Pale malts and green fruits, like apples and pears. Nice, spicy yeast notes and a light touch of floral hops. A nice aroma, but not quite as forthcoming as I remembered.  TASTE: Pale malts and lots of green apples and pears. Nice floral hop bitterness at the swallow with a big, bold aftertaste of spicy yeast, clove and pepper, and a good floral bitterness. A touch of alcohol as well. Very flavorful especially after the swallow.  PALATE: Thinner body and high levels of carbonation. Bubbly and light on the palate, goes down quite airy and finishes slightly dry on the palate. I understand this is the style, but this is too thin, bubbly and airy for my palate. Others in the style have agreed with me more.  OVERALL: This is a well made, interesting and flavorful beer that I've had often. While the palate makes this tough for me to drink in mass quantities, the flavor is enojoyable enough for me to re-visit it from time to time.

Clear golden beer, intense carbonation flowing up from the bottom. Honestly I'd say the retention is a little too much, die down so I can drink you!  S: I just get straw and a bit of yeast. No off-smells but nothing special.  T: Very delicate and homogeneous, hard for me to pick out any individual flavors. A bit of apricot at the end of a sip as it dries. Clean aftertaste, nothing lingers.  M: Very carbonated, champagne-like. A bit much for my taste, but I guess correct for the style.  Overall: A good beer and a nice rite of passage I feel like I needed.

Tastes of belgian yeast, fruit, banana, grasses, spice. It's quite crisp and refreshing. Hardly any hint of alcohol.  Highly carbonated, smooth, refreshing and crisp. Easy to drink.  For a beer with a high ABV, this is very mellow and easy to drink. The price is the only thing holding me back from giving a higher overall score. I really enjoyed this beers taste.

222,695,jtingue,4.53,"Best before 08 2014. Poured into Duvel tulip glass.  Appearance. Crystal clear golden straw in color. Huge amounts of effervescent bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass. Pours with 4 fingers of dense head which dissipates to make a more rocky head with lots of lacing.  Smell. Very clean and very fruity at the same time. Very refined peach and banana fruit aromas are joined by subtle spices, almonds.  Taste. Starts out with some of the nuttiness and spice found in the nose. This melds into a more clove and subtle fruit character. It then becomes decidedly more floral, accompanied by a warming alcohol presence. A more pronounced peach, and tropical fruitiness returns. A burst of sweetness leads into a dry and nutty and spicy finish.  Mouthfeel. Absolutely decadent with a very tight carbonation and creamy body. Really delivers the refined flavors to the palate.  My brain has been trained to see a clear golden beer and not expect fullness of flavor and body, but this one breaks both of those assumptions.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

There is lots of carbonation, and a huge white head.  S: Belgian yeast, a little sweet/fruity, Pilsner malts.  T: Sour and a little acetic at first but fades into nice crisp, light, fruity yeast flavor with the pilsner malts. It is a bit minerally. Better as warms, less off flavors, but mineral flavor increases.  M: Light as expected. Not much aftertaste at all, and finishes pretty dry. Only a bit of alcohol presence.  O: Man, this just didn't do it for me. The malt aroma just reminds me of cheap beer and I just couldn't get over it. It did get a little better as it warmed up some (or as I got used to it) but didn't meet my expectations.

222,695,jerryusc,4.41,"Appearance - Clear, golden color with a white bubbly head, just like you might expect a classic beer photo to appear.  Smell - Lemony sweet smell that includes a hint of fresh cut wheat. A tinge of alcohol lingers in the aroma. A classic sweet and sour food combination comes to mind. Curious smell that brings you back out of interest, but not one that I would seek out.  Taste - Refreshing and bold, this beer has hints of banana that balance the more citrusy flavors. Not to degrade this one, but it tastes like you wish many of the American pilsners would, even if a different style.  Mouthfeel - This one is surprisingly thick, given the clarity in appearance. It is similar in MF to a Trappist Dark Ale. The full body seems to match the banana hints in the taste. Great balance of carbonation helps make the thick MF.  Overall - exceptional. This was my first Belgian Strong Pale Ale. I was skeptical at first b/c I have high regard for Belgian Strong Darks.

222,695,hagbergl,4.39,"About time I've reviewed this classic and classy Belgian ale. I had it on draft at the University of Chicago Pub in a Tripel Karmeliet tulip glass.  Appearance (4.25/5): Duvel has that class golden ale look–beautiful clear golden/pale yellow body with a massive three-finger head of pillowy white. Looks luxuriant.  Smell (4/5): Hoppy, very clean, crisp and beautiful light candy-like pale maltiness. Yeasty, though not strongly so. A subtle grassy/herbal noble hop presence is noticeable, though it is pretty subtle and combines well with the yeast and malt characters.  Taste (4.5/5): Clean hoppiness from the grassy, herbal, and lightly citric hops and lightly musty yeast dominate the flavor. This is certainly not a sweet Belgian pale ale. Very well balanced, Duvel is only modestly hop-forward. Its flavor is extremely refreshing and you don't notice any of the alcohol in the flavor, which is impressive considering this an 8.5% ABV beer. This is a sure sign of masterful brewing.  Mouthfeel (4.75/5): A nearly champagne-like medium-high carbonation gives this brew a really nice pop on the tongue. This beer is medium-light bodied, so the relatively high carbonation really adds a nice dimension to the beer. The mouthfeel on this beer is impeccably pulled off. The combination of hoppy-yeasty flavors with the champagne-like carbonation mesh really nicely.  Overall (4.5/5): Duvel is considered a classic for a reason. It has a wonderfully balanced sweet-bitter flavor profile that is boosted by the excellent mouthfeel and never reveals the high alcohol content. Here is a Belgian beer that is more accessible than most, but its accessibility does not make it any less of a class act. Excellent.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,MaximalC,4.31,"Pours a hazy straw color with a mountainous, craggy white head. The aroma smells mildly of apple, pear, and trace amounts of hops. The massive head tempers only slightly as you drink, maintaining itself like a champ. The first thing I notice upon tasting is the intense carbonation, whose prickliness near singes the tongue (though not in a bad way). The flavor is sweet and juicy up front, similar to the aroma, while some bitterness presents on the back end. There is an almost honey-like sweetness that melds with the apple and pear notes. A strong sense of apple peel becomes increasingly evident as it warms, and a slight spiciness begins to manifest in the finish. Hops are tastefully integrated, just enough to lend some balance and complexity. As the session continues, alcohol becomes more present in the aroma, though not so much on the palate, which is impressive for the ABV. Swaths of lacing cling to the glass as the beer recedes. This is a crisp and refreshing brew indeed, and not short on flavor. Hard to find fault here in any regard, and pretty much the grandest head you'll find in a beer. A real winner.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Some peppery clove smells come through with some subtle fruit notes.. The taste is dominated by the yeast no one unique flavor come out of the yeast, but some spice and malt in there as well. This is a medium bodied beer, which adds to the beer, nice blend of all elements. This is the best aspect, every flavor seems to be in just the right proportion to every other flavor.

It’s kind of a bitter pepper taste. Also, a hint of cider.  Mouthfeel – Medium body, good carbonation, and smooth. .  Drinkability – This is a highly drinkable beer.

A lot of visible carbonation rising quickly to the surface. Head slowly becomes rockier and sinks over the course of 5 minutes. Leaves a lot of lacing on the sides of the glass.  S: First I get some light belgian yeast, and a mild malt aroma. Has some light fruit qualities as well banana, grape, peach. Alcohol is slightly noticeable.  T: Similar to the smell, has some belgian yeast but then some crisp hops make an appearance. There are certainly some smooth pale malts in there evening it out. Alcohol is more in the front than back. Ends with a nice belgiany banana.  M: Pretty high in carbonation, crisp, light bodied and pretty refreshing. Quite drinkable for 8.5%  Overall always a great beer to have. Hard to turn on down. Tasty, strong and easy to enjoy a few in a row.

Full of spicy peppery Belgian yeast. Banana and pear come to mind. Floral notes as well. Now this is how a Belgian Pale should smell.  I can see why Michael Jackson and this site rated this so highly. Everything is so balanced, yet every flavor is pronounced. The yeast feels spicy and floral. The main fruit flavors are pear and banana. It feels like like theres some biscuit malt in there somewhere as well.  So drinkable for 8.5%. full-bodied, and decently carbonated.

When poured, the bubbles just keep rising in a very elegant and champagne-like style. And the head that appears is simply striking and it doesn't go away. It's like a beautiful cloud of goodness atop a glass of heaven.  The smell is complex and pleasant. There are certainly some lemony scents, but along with the citrus tones are spices (I don't know, maybe ginger or coriander??) and just a little bit of alcohol along with some sweet contrasts to the citrus bite. It's wonderful.  The taste is a continuation of the aroma. Bubbly, spicy, tiny amounts of the hops, it's a beer you could almost chew. The heavy carbonation acts as a way to diffuse the enjoyment all around the mouth. There is a little hint of alcohol, just in case you've forgotten it's 8.5% ABV. The alcohol content (for me, at least) makes this a beer to truly enjoy, but in proper quantities. Session this beer and pay the price! But the taste makes me want to session.  Overall this is truly a world-class brew, and I consider it lucky that my local drive through in a town of 17,000 people carries it! My wife (who's become a bit of an enthusiast quickly!) proclaims it to be the best beer she's ever tasted, and I tend to agree.

At the precise location where the etched 'D' is located at the bottom of the glass, insane amounts of carbonation geyser straight up.  S-Wonderfully aromatic from the moment I uncapped the bottle.

M- Strong carbonation and light body make this one refreshing and highly drinkable beers. Again, without any trace of alcohol, The Devil just may make a visit after a couple...tread lightly.  O- The ratings for this beer do not lie. This is simply a world-class offering that everyone needs to try.

222,695,Zachtheporter,3.88,"Poured from a 350ml bottle into a duvel glass.  A- A rich golden straw color with a fat fizzy white bubbly head. Clearly it is well carbonated. Large streaks of bubbles rapidly bubbling forth from the bottom up to the top of the glass, yet despite being able to view them the beer is rather murky.  S- Strong Belgian yeast sent coupled with bubblegum, bananas, pears. Has an estery skunkiness to it that is very reminiscent of many American adjunct and light lagers. Slight slight hop bitterness .  T- starts of sweet with a sour slightly bitter finish. fruity with hints of banana and pears coupled with very slight candy notes. Ends with a sourness akin to slightly sour apples, some spice notes, and a faint hint of lemon zest. Leaves a nice bubbelgym sweetness on the back of the tounge  M- Light to medium body feel and heavily carbonated.  O- Very decent, like I expected. While it IS good, there isn't really much I would say that is memorable about this beer. It is a very delicious straight forward Belgian ale. Because of the price I probably wont buy this again, but other than that this is an overall good beer. Very classic.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,jrenihan,4.35,"BB Oct 2013  Pours a clear yellowish-gold with a huge, fluffy white head. Recedes slowly and leaves lots of sticky lacing.  Smell is lovely. Yeast, light fruit such as green apple, spice and candied fruit. Smell hits you as soon as it starts pouring.  Taste is also great. The green apple flavour is strong but nicely coupled with a dry spiciness and yeast flavour that provides a great balance. A bit of a hop flavour, but mild.  Highly carbonated, full bodied. Alcohol is noticeable but not greatly.  Overall, a true classic. Not sure why it took me so long to review this one, but I am a big fan.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,acevenom,4.88,"Poured into a chalice. Pours hazy yellow with an abundant white head that dissipates slowly. Plenty of bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass. The head retains fairly well, leaving less than a finger of head atop the beer and plenty of lacing on the glass. There's a strong aroma of fruity yeast, spices, and light malts. The flavor is very bold, but it does follow the smell. The yeast and malt flavors come together very well with the spiciness and the hops. There is some apple flavor as well. It's a very pleasing flavor and the sweet and bitter flavors balance extremely well. The alcohol is covered very well by all the flavors. The body is light and the carbonation is abundant. The finish is crisp and dry. This is very easy to drink for a beer that is 8.5% ABV. Overall, this is an excellent beer that every one exploring beer should consume at least once.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

It really doesn't have a strong smell but it sure does have a strong taste but still light for its category.  m. It's easily drinkable beer. It was like 10 minute still the foam of the beer wasn't going away. I guess this beer supposed to do that. (correct me if I am wrong).  o. I would recommend this beer if you don't like strong beer. Very crisp taste. Just careful dont drink too many.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

It's really bright, I haven't poured in the yeast yet, but the carbonation is coming up from the bottom of the glass very quickly. Looks nice.  It smells awesome. Right after opening the bottle, I could smell it. Lots of fruity yeast, some light malts perhaps, and maybe a touch of alcohol but that is probably just the strong sweet presence of the yeast.  The taste is far different than the smell. You first get some of the yeast, perhaps a nice slight bitterness from the hops and alcohol, and a nice tart sparkling wine-like tartness on the way down. I'm tasting some really nice bready notes coming back after the finish.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

The beer has a three finger tall fizzy white head that reduces by condensing down to a thin layer with larger pillowy patches and a thicker ringer at the edges of the glass. Significant lacing is observed.  S: This beer does not have one of the strongest smells but it is definitely not weak either... I get some notes of yeast, spices, and some light fruit (possibly pear). Also, there are both floral and citrus hops present as well.  T: The flavor is far more intense than the smell but follows in the same vein. There is quite a bit of light fruit flavor including apple and pear as well as the banana + clove. There is a light hop bitterness in the finish but it is not overwhelming.  M: Light bodied with significant amounts of carbonation. Crisp and dry.  O: A very enjoyable and easy to drink beer. A little strong to be sessionable but definitely a beer that you want to have many times.

In this tulip, a constant heavy plume of carbonation can be seen in the center of the glass. The lacing is best in class.  S: Smell is grassy and spicy with hints of juicy apple, hay, and sugar.  T: Holy. Cow. The taste is more akin to a fine champagne rather than a beer. A touch of Belgian yeast combines with the spicy Saaz hops. This is supported by a sweet, juicy green apple undertone and cracker malts. Ends spicy and dry.  M: Mouthfeel is legendary. This is a medium bodied and velvety smooth beer. The massive amount of bubbles massage on the way down. There is a burning feeling from the alcohol a bit after I swallowed, though. This was mostly felt in the center of my esophagus.

222,695,Aethien,4.88,"Poured into my Duvel tulip, the beer is a pale golden colour with a formidable white head that fills up the tulip and doesn't go away. It is, in my opinion, what a beer should look like. It has a sweet spicy smell with yeast, pepper, lemon and fresh green apple. There's a perfect balance of bitter and sweet. Green apples and lemon in the front followed by yeast, cloves and spiciness and a warming alcohol near the end. Crispy, light and smooth almost champagne like feel with a beautiful slightly dry and grainy finish that makes you want to drink more.  This beer is complex, heavy on the alcohol, always refreshing, very drinkable (Way too drinkable for the ABV) and it really never ever bores. In my opinion this is one of the best beers on earth. One of the first beers I discovered as I began to appreciate beer and over 2 years and many, many glasses of Duvel later it is still one of the greatest beers I've ever had.

Taste is very full and flavorful until it warms, when it becomes acrid, acidic, and somewhat unpleasant.

Look: Poured from the bottled (+ sediment). The beer had a hazy bright golden color with a high level of carbonation bubbles reacting to the laser etching on the bottom of the signature Duvel glass. Head was a clump of white foam, almost like a scoop of ice cream.  Smell: The aroma was of a medicinal banana. Also some sweet Belgian candy sugar notes were present. Some grassy hops were detected as well.  Taste: First was an herbal banana - like a banana that wasn’t quite ripe. Then was a quick alcohol bite with a clean Belgian yeast note that diminished just before a tasteless finish.  I'm afraid this beer may have been hyped up a bit. Granted I'm a little biased - being American and all, but this one has certainly been influenced by some European marketing tactics. Let's face it - most American pale ales would blow this one away. For example - Oskar Blues Dales Pale Ale, or even anything from SN... and this one is even considered a 'strong'.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

The first whiff I get reminds me of a light Chardonnay. Then I pick up some cloves and perhaps a whisp of pepper.  A- Light golden, straw colored with a large white head and belgian lacing on the glass.  F- Clove are present along with some background peppery spice. I get a touch of hot alcohol at the finish.  M- Light with a intense prickly sensation on the tongue from the high carbonation. Cleansing the palate rapidly is another feature of the high carbonation.  O- Extremely drinkable and subtly complex.

Well, I don’t plan on doing it justice now either, this beer is a must try. You’ll just have to experience this sacred nectar for yourself.  Poured from 330ml bottle to snifter: The beer pours a perfect gold with a swelling, soft white head that fills the snifter, and then recedes gradually to a healthy dollop. Constant, needlepoint beading that doesn’t let up. The beer smells just wonderfully bright and clean, fresh. All kinds of inviting esters and clove. Some light pepper and fruit, crisp sweet grain. The taste is equally impressive. Just the right touch of spice to complement everything found in the nose. The Belgian yeast really comes to the forefront - the pinnacle of the beer I think.

Smell: Tons of citrus fruits, pineapple, orange, lemon, bit of grassiness, and a great bready yeast note, with a slight kiss of clean alcohol.  Taste: Nice bitter spice from the hops, good amount of citrus notes in the taste. Has a very dry, almost Champange taste to it on the finish.  Mouthfeel: A nice crisp medium body that encourages you to take another sip time and again.  Overall: Simply a world class brew.

Pouring the yeast turns the color into a cloudy yellow. The snow-white head is very generous, fluffy, with a excellent retention. Good lacing on the glass.  S - Very complex smell! Malt is dominant but I pick out a lot of aromas besides: candy sugar, yeast, spices, pepper, apricots, apple, dry fruits. The whole blend is extremely inviting!  T - I'm slightly disappointed by the taste. It's not as complex as the smell, though it's much better than the average. It reveals malt, plums, spices throughout, but the most remarkable thing is this distinctive taste which appears in the middle, something close to caramelized apple (I'm not quite sure...).  M - Medium to full bodied, this beer is very crispy on the palate and the high carbonation is slightly over-powering in my opinion. Sugar is well balanced by the hop. Good warming touch and very dry mouthfeel at the end.  O - A classic Belgian Pale Ale, very easy to drink and full of complexity.

Anyhow, poured the trademark big head which was soapy and fizzly. Honey colored body with some yeast present as I did decide to pour the settlement in. I feel as the beer is not complete without it! Smells of strong character malts followed by a wave of corn, banana, biscuit and sweet cane sugar. Tastes of banana, yeast, a biscuit with a slight hop finish.

S - Spicy and wonderful fruity yeast esters are exceedingly complex. Lemony hops. Touch of soft alcohol. Delicate toasty malt otherwise no other malt smells coming through. A little bit of tartness. No Brett characteristics.  T - Green apple skin, candy sugar doesn't leave a syrupy sweet cloying flavor. Alcohol shines through, could mellow with some aging.  M - Light to medium bodied. Moderate to high carbonation makes for a crisp finish. Dry finish with alcohol warming but not as much as the 8.5% would believe you to think.  O - My Second Belgian Strong Pale Ale.

222,695,Converge,4.41,"330ml bottle poured into a 16oz tulip.  A - Pours with a mountain of snow-white head, clearing the top of the glass by a full inch easily. Hazy golden color. This beer looks absolutely perfect. Incredible head retention that leaves behind a web of sticky, bubbly lacing.  S - Sweet malt and fruitiness backed by some nice grassy hops. Apple and pear notes make of much of the fruit aspect, but a light citrusy zest comes through as well. A touch of spice and some barley are also detectable. I don't get a lot of yeastiness here though, kind of odd.  T - Tons going on here. Lots of fruity flavors, with tart apples, light banana notes, white grapes, and a touch of pear coming through. Yeast is much more apparent here, really bready and distinctly Belgian. Finish is a barrage of tart apples, floral and grassy hops, bready yeast and strong spices. While the spices do have a citrusy coriander like character, there's a powerful peppery quality that gives the finish a really unique feel. While this beer is very true to what Belgian ales are, it has a different feel than any I've come across. Aftertaste is light bitterness, yeast, peppery spice, light but earthy malt, and a faint touch of alcohol warmth. Fairly complex, but at the same time balanced really well.  M - Light-to-medium bodied. Carbonation is quite high, but feels nice and bubbly, and not fizzy. Finishes spicy and dry. Just a touch syrupy from the alcohol. While the carbonation is nice, as I can feel the bubbles lightly prickle my tongue even after the beer is gone, the feel overall wasn't as smooth as I had hoped. For a brew that I've heard considered the 'champagne of beers', this area was a slight let down.  D - Overall, an excellent beer. It's easy to see why this one is an absolute classic and a must-try for any beer-lover. While the flavor profile is fairly big and complex, it's also balanced and extremely easy to drink, and the drinkability on this one is through the roof.

Large bubbles. Excellent retention. Lacing as good as I’ve seen on any beer. Body is crisp, golden and crystal clear. The champagne of beers? :)  S: Very forward Belgian yeast and light fruit. Banana, pear, apple and orange peel. You get a sense that there may be some sweetness here. Also some grassy hops and breadiness.  T: Starts slightly sweet and crisp but then becomes nicely bitter and dries out fairly quickly. There is some spice from the yeast and hops. Some banana. Some woody characteristics mid-palate right as the dryness sets in. Strong alcoholic and warming finish. You really get shot of pure alcohol flavor if you aerate this in your mouth a bit.  M: Light to medium body. High carbonation. The light body, crisp flavor profile and heavy carb make this very drinkable despite the very present warming alcohol.

Opening the bottle was a surprise -- it was like popping a champagne cork.  Appearance (3.5).

222,695,Hoppsbabo,5,"This is a composite review using my original review as a backbone. I drink this every week and I've had it in every form in all sorts of weird places around the world.  S: Sweet, hard to pin down. Vinous. Banana. Peppery cloves.  A: Poured into a medium red wine glass. The glorious head, I can only compare to the toxic foam on the River Ganges. It's so pretty. The body is a beautiful opaque golden colour with lots of active strings of bubbles and it looks like champagne.  T: Fairly tart bitterness. Dry and champagne like. Lots of white bread, green grapes, black pepper and vinous yeast. As it warms it gets very earthy. The unique black pepper/clove-like flavour reminds me of burning dust, like when you put on the fire for the first time after summer. Lemon and citrus in the aftertastes, but sometimes apples. Light on the tongue but not so carbonated as to dissipate.  A: Imparts a sharp bitterness on the back of the tongue. Once that's settled I get a nice soft bread flavour and lots of apple.  O: This is a true premium beer, in a totally different league from anything I've reviewed from Belgium. In my book it's a candidate for the best beer in the world. The nose on it is so good that I once spent ten minutes just whiffing it from a deep wine glass.  EDIT: The 750ml corked version is fresher and more alive. The foam is chewier and the lemons and apples seem to have been replaced with pungent fresh cut grass and earth. If this beer was hard to find I bet it would be more sort after than Westy Xll.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,NardiByNature,4.26,"A: Truly golden in color, mostly clear, hyperactive streams of carbonation. A paper-white head builds and settles into a pretty thick covering.. You can actually see the bubbles rising up and add themselves to the head.  S: Bananas off the bat; honey, cut grass. Apple juice when it's warmer.  T: Hops come through nicely to compliment the banana/biscuity softness.  M: Damn--a fizzy shock completely wakes up your mouth. Dry and bubbly finish, a little bitter from the hops.  Overall: Tantalizing.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,CowsCanBark,4.56,"Poured from 11.2 oz. bottle into Samuel Adams pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a lightly hazy golden color with a thick two-finger head that is fluffy as clouds and stays just about forever. A nice amount of lacing left on the glass as well.  Smell: Slightly earthy, tart, fruity, boozy  Taste: This is what I love about Belgian Strongs: this beer is bold. There is a a zesty fruitiness to it, like plums, a nice taste of sweet hops, and a hint of sweet maltyness. It is also tart all the way throughout, with a spicy alcohol burn on the nose, but the alcohol taste is not that prominent.  Mouthfeel: The body is moderate to light, which is surprisingly light for this type of beer. There is also a high amount of carbonation, also not common in this beer style. This allows the beer to be insanely drinkable, pretty much a session beer, but with those great Belgian fruit tastes and a nice buzz.  Overall: One of my favorite Belgian Pales so far. So damn flavorful and complex, yet so easy to drink and enjoy. You MUST try it.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,shigg85,4.88,"Duvel is my go-to beer whenever I can find it in a store. A reasonable price for an amazing brew. As I cruise up and down the aisles, i'm always telling myself, ""I can always get Duvel..."" I'm a sucker for Belgian strong pale ales, and this is the one that turned me onto them. The head on this beer is thick enough to support a dime. Sometimes, I get a bit of a sour scent that comes off of it, but other than that, this beer is damn near flawless. Amazing floral mix in the taste that incorporates lots of hops with a mix of fruit such as citrusy gold. Pour this into a tulip glass if you have one, but even a pilsner will do... anything that will lead the head expand and release all of its magic.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,fmccormi,4.33,"Straight pour from 330ml / 11.2oz bottle to a classic Duvel tulip. I thought about pouring it into something else just out of spite, but I figured the head on this bastard should be a bit colossal for something any more narrow-mouthed . . . freshness date of May, 2014 printed on the bottom left corner of the back label (“Best before: 05 2014 L2611 2115”)  Appearance (4.5): 24ct golden color, moderately hazy, rising quickly to four or five fingers of bone-white head, mix of fine and fat bubbles, until the head collapses to a chunky cookie on top a still-pretty-fat-head, with dry, sticky lacing all over the sides. Nice, steady stream of fine bubbles streaming to the top from the little “D” etching. Impressive, without a doubt.  Smell (4.0): Nothing but biscuity bread aromas, white pepper and floral hops, and a bit of spice. Some light coriander, maybe. Very clean, classic aroma.  Taste (4.5): Definition of dry. Nice peppery body and a very long finish, moving from bitter-herbal to a light floral note. This beer is peppery all over the place but not overbearing in any way. Some light lemon and pear juice mixed in with that lightly sweet biscuit character. Understated, well-put together, subtle and well-crafted. Not as fruity, rich and tart as my favorites, maybe, but this is still great.  Mouthfeel (4.0): Surprisingly light mouthfeel, way below medium-bodied with a nice mix of fluffy and prickly carbonation—not as aggressive as I remember, but it’s still quite nice.  Overall (4.5): Duvel is a beautiful beer. It never gets old, is about the most approachable thing out there but is still so well done that anybody can appreciate it. I might prefer the style to be funky with more fruity esters and a wheat edge in there, but Duvel really is a benchmark in BSPAs.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,JohnBeerRun,2.9,I bought this beer liking the way it looked on the shelf. It pours into a glass very nicely with a good bit of head. The aroma is a fruity taste with a kind of bitter finish.

222,695,Drinkerofales,4.38,"Pours clear at first, some yeast at the end. Colors is light gold, almost yellow. A huge frothy head almost overcame my tulip, and left behind fluffy lacing. There was still plenty of froth in the bottom of the glass after I finished.  Smell is Belgian yeast, fruity, clean and fresh with a hint of spice and zest.  Taste is wow, lightly peppery. Citrusy and yeasty, all flavors balanced and hitting the right notes.  Feels nicely carbonated, zesty, lemony tangy. An almost light body hides the 8.5% extremely well, as this is fun and easy to drink.  What a classic taste, and a classic beer. A must have. Though I have had it before, it's the first time in years, and I appreciate it more now then I did then.  DOA",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Flatlands,4.38,I bought this beer because is was a 4 pack that was packaged with a tulip Duvel glass for a great price. This is a Belgium with more hops bite but still has some great fruit flavors. It also has a huge white head that retains all the way to the bottom of the glass. The fruit is more on the apple side and less orange then other Belgians Ales I have had.  It hides the 8.5 AVB well and to me is actually a beer I would enjoy on a Summer day. This is one to keep stocked.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Tastes mimic the nose with a spicy finish and green apple fade.  Mouthfeel is light, alcohol is well masked, and bubbles are champagne-like.  I typically don't dig much on many Belgians and yeasty beers piss me off.

I cleaned the glass and poured from one of the bottles (the freshness date was indiscernible to due lack of ink and rubbing) to the Duvel tulip. The beer pours a huge 3 finger white head with excellent retention and lacing. The head slowly fades. Beer is a perfectly clear and bright straw color. Excellent appearance. The aroma is that of a crisp fruity character: pear, mild banana, apple. Hints of spicy hops. Very nice. The flavor is even more impressive with such complex character and ultimate balance. Again light fruity character as found in the nose with pairs perfectly with a tart bready flavor. Mild bitterness works very well with the citrus tart. Full bodied and crisp and clean. Overall, a supreme beer, instantly one of my favorites. Highly recommended.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

M: Medium bodied with high carbonation and a dry finish.  O: Overall this a great beer. I'd recommend to any fan of Belgian styles and new craft beer drinkers.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,leaddog,4.38,"Appearance - Pours a very pale golden yellow (like a ginger ale) with a dense, creamy head (white in colour), leaving a nice lacing on the glass. Has nice clarity with bubbles present.  Smell - Citrus fruits (predominantly lemon and lime), tropical fruits (passionfruit, mango), very slight hint of vanilla.  Taste - Bready, biscuity flavour from the malts. Slight hint of fruitiness (as from the aromas). Very light bitterness in the aftertaste. Alcohol is moderately detected.  Mouthfeel - Very sharp tingle from the carbonation. Medium bodied with a light fluffiness to it.  Overall - A good representation of the Belgian Strong Pale Ale style.

222,695,Acho,4.63,"Awesome head, immaculate white and pale yellow cloudy colour, with a torrent of bubbles that helps mantain the huge head for what feels like ages. Yeasty aromas, very Belgian. A well worked taste, not very light and the alcohol is there but you nearly do not feel it, which leaves a memorable mouthfeel, you have to try it.  An awesome beer for 1,89 € here, quite worth it.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,climax,4.13,"The gentlest of pours undoubtedly yields a still impressive white fizzy head. It fades lazily leaving a crater in the center. The color is a brilliant gold, even in low light; cloudy but not completely so. Lace is pretty much a solid sheet of tiny white bubbles, a promising beginning.  Tart and sweet aromas fume from this one, with no alcohol tones whatsoever. Banana and yeast are the most discernible flavors, while modest mandarin orange and clove aromas come and go. A sweet white wine character comes to mind as well.  Alcohol is evident in the flavor, but more as a phantom warmth as opposed to twang; the way it should be. It starts with a full dose of yeast and begins to take on a pleasant sour tone before the finish. The aftertaste is soft and clean, with no real dryness.  It's heavier than it looks, yet so easy to drink. The carbonation is sharp enough that you've gotta sip it though. Solid beer, as it's sterling reputation suggests.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,cooler4life,4.58,"A: Poured a fluffy two finger pure white head. Pillows of foam are bountiful. In my Duvel tulip, I can see 15-20 streams of carbonation billowing to the top. Color of the beer is a bright straw yellow. Little to no cloudiness, just clear perfection. The lacing seems to last forever. World Class.  S: Fruit galore. Apple peel, pears, bananas. Whifts of spicy hops, bubblegum, breadcrumbs assault the senses.  T: So many flavors but in all the complexity, balance. Light fruit, minerals, sourdough bread. Finishes tart with some barnyard funk. Buttery sweet, its hard to even compete.  M: The tartness from the citrus tones invigorates your palate with an almost acrid jolt. Full bodied, I'm trying to understand how such a 'Lager-esque' type beer can provide such depth and fullness. Leaves your palate crisp and clean.  O: This beer is juicy. Like biting into a malt, hop stuffed granny smith apple, flavor abounds.

A white lacing stays throughout they drink.  I get a spicy pepper nose with that citrus Belgium undertone and a black dark fruit whiff.  This brew has a bright, spicy, citrus, pepper, beginning that leads way to a crisp yeasty middle and fresh tangy fruit. I get a pepper and Belgium yeast aftertaste with a nice blend of subtly malts.  What a wonderfully balanced brew in the traditional Belgium style that has a nice warming of alcohol that doesn't overpower. Good malt and hops blended together in this beer give way to a nice creamy beer that you wont forget.  Cheers!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Decent fruitiness like banana and pear. A touch of pepper?  T: Against, quite yeasty. Typical bananas and cloves with a strong breadiness. Earthy/herbal hoppiness. Some spice character, maybe black pepper?  M: Highly carbonated, medium bodied, smooth and quite drying.  O: Certainly one of the best and easiest to procure BSPAs. Personally I like the Ommegang offerings (Gnomegang, BPA) and Russian River's Damnation just a little better.

Poured the 33cL bottle into an original Duvel tulip glass. The color is pale golden, clear with a little yeasty haze. I love the way the head looks, fluffy, foamy and stable.  When I opened the bottle I immediately noticed a grainy, fruity smell. In the glass it took a while for the foam to dissappear and let the full scent come through. It smelled fruity, with fresh apples, herbal hops and grainy with an obvious yeast character.  The taste was very dry, maybe even a little bit sour, but fruity, lots of grains and light herbal. Well balanced ale.  It is a medium bodied ale with a lot of carbonation that fits the style (Duvel invented). It's dry and the alcohol is only slightly noticeable.  Overall it is a great beer.

Finishes strong with a twinge of hops biting at the sides of your tongue.  M: Effervescent. Very bubbly and sharp, but medium bodied.  O: Not every bottle is consistent in my experience.

The head is pure and white as wind driven snow and certainly rivals the best I've ever seen for longevity and pure volume clinging to the glass.  Gentle grainy pale malt, alcohol perfume, slightly funky and minty yeast, and faint herbal hop.  Yeast and herbal hop pick up, I find things rather minty and sweeter than the nose betrayed, honeyed pale malt. A bitterness struggles to be crisp, but it's too sweet in my opinion. I even taste a bit of skunk, but I don't see how this could be light struck; put it down to my taste buds interpretation of the yeast and hops. Wait, band-aid?  At first it was refreshing, but the body feels increasingly heavy as the carbonation fades too quickly.  This falls short for me.

Not a pronounced aroma, some pepper, grasses, yeast and grains with very faint citrus, all of which are very subdued.  Taste: First quaff gets me a wallop of alcohol wrapped around my tongue with a ton of bubbles and acidic hop. Very dry. Light biscuit hidden in there somewhere, mild sweetness is overwhelmed by the alcohol and bitters. Thin body, almost like a champagne. As the temp rose of both glass and beer, aroma and flavors emerge that are of a far more citrusy and aromatic nature. Hop is still there at the back end standing strong, but I’m getting some really great sweetness in there I hadn’t gotten at all at first.  Verdict: I definitely would enjoy this with some cheeses or cold meat. It doesn’t come across to me as well-sculpted, but if you’re looking for something relatively inexpensive with some bite and solid ABV (8.5%) you could certainly do worse.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

S: First thing I get is spice (coriander). Lots of it. Then that belgium bready yeast character shines through. Lots of lemon zest. Smells fantastic!  T: Spice and zest. Earthy hop. Belgium yeast. A touch of alcohol is present, but it is pretty well masked. Overall light and refreshing. A light lemon tartness is present in the aftertaste. Excellent balance.  M: Extremely carbonated, medium-light body. Fills the mouth (and stomach) with CO2 and creates a champagne spritz-y feeling across the tongue.  I've been meaning to buy this one for a while, but the only thing that discouraged me was the price. I snagged a 4 pack on sale (and with a really cool Duvel oversized tulip) for $12.99.

S- Spicy/earthy hops, yeast, tart apples, some wheat and malts.  T- Just great, complex, and balanced. Sweet citrus and malts upfront with a nice pepper/hoppy finish that is brought together by a very faint tartness in the middle.  M- Medium, smooth, crisp, dry, and very lively with the carbonation.  O- A fantastic beer that is easy to drink and hides the 8.5% ABV very well. Definitely will be pick up some more very soon!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,dirtyskunk,4.33,"Poured into a Triple Petrus tulip. Beautiful looking beer. Tons of sloppy head that sticks around forever, lots of lacing and a permanent white cap on top of the cloudy golden yellow beer.  Smells like candied pineapple, just a little funky grass/straw. Light malt and a little wheat. Not overly complex, but definitely solid and pungent.  Bone dry pull on the tongue despite a little sweetness from that candied pineapple thing going on. The fruitiness has just an edge of tartness that also factors in and balances things. There's just a tiny bit of medicinal/metallic flavor going on. I guess you could say it's part of the funk/tartness. Incredible how well the booze is hidden, just a little peppery alcohol spice to hint at that 8.5 ABV.  Silky smooth texture. It's like drinking custard. Low carbonation though.  Not much else to say about this one. World class. It's a classic, and maybe my favorite trappist.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

It's lacy, but the lacing is faint and delicate.  Smell: faint and whispers of hops and sweet and sour nuances. Hops and honey are what I'm smelling.  Taste: Solid or firm flavor, emcompassing the art of beer and adaptable with other beers and meal pairings. This beer would be a good stepping stone for a gal who likes Stella or Blue Moon. It's refreshing and flavorful.  Mouthfeel: Perfected balance of carbonation and flavor  Overall: I really like this beer, it's my go-to beer, it's great with a really heavy meal - to lighten things up and it compliments vegetarian dishes nicely.

222,695,Agent1,4.45,"Duvel Moortgat was one of the first Belgian beers to grab my attention and thankfully, steer me away from the plethora of corporate beer companies masquerading as craft breweries. I've had this countless times, but still worth a review!  Appearance - A stern golden yellow. Quite vivid. The carbonation really brings this beer to life! Rather clear and it is obvious that this is filtered. A very bubbly, bright head. Nice and white. Great lacing.  Smell - The smell of yeast is the first thing that jumps out to me. The bouquet is quite piny due to the hops (definitely a characteristic of the Saaz hops). Lots of floral notes as well as some 'earthy' qualities.  Taste - I can immediately taste the white sugars in this, versus Belgian candy sugar or even some beers that use brown. It's fairly obvious if you focus on its sweet characteristics. Lots of flower and herb coming through. The hops bring out some pine as well. This beer is considerably bitter, but maintains a great sense of balance.  Mouthfeel - Great feel! I always find that some of the best beers I've had are the ones that stimulate all parts of the mouth. This beer always does that. However, I feel this mostly on the sides of my tongue. Very warm, smooth feel on the palate.  Overall - I still love this beer. Especially when on sale (which happened to be the case this time)! Hard to turn down such a solid import that delivers every time. When given the opportunity to introduce a more complex or foreign beer to friends, this is usually my brewery of choice. A solid Belgian blonde for sure.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

The head is very firm compared to most, I can push down on it like a soft marshmallow.  S: A clean fruity smell here, reminiscent of apples. Faint, but this smells appealing.  T: Very clean taste throughout. I'm picking up light fruit notes, lemon with apples and a nice cloves spice finish.  M: Medium bodied with light fizzy carbonation.  O: I enjoy this a lot, it has a very clean inoffensive flavor that will appeal to even the biggest beer hater.

Estery aroma, very floral with some clove, some coriander, a sprinkle of banana (I realize this is starting to sound like a hefe description!) with an underlying sweetness to it.

222,695,Haufniensis,1.96,"11.26.2011 – Duvel Belgian Golden Ale. ABV: 8.5  Appearance: Bottle says to pour gently, so I started with a gentle pour. But I wasn’t getting any head, so I finish a little more aggressively. Still not much head. Nothing like the picture on the back of the bottle. About a half inch. Maybe the bottle was too cold right out of the fridge? Color is yellow-gold. A little cloudy. Grade: 3  Smell: Not great, a little stale. Reminds me a lot of a Miller High Life. Hoping that taste will not disappoint. I really want to like this beer given it’s “world class” status and all. Grade: 2  Taste: Champagne. Tasteless suds. Strange hoppiness, a little stale tasting. Lots of lemon. Some lilac, especially in the aftertaste. No malt. Grade: 2.5  Mouth: Bubbly as hell. Yes, hell-like is a good way to describe it. Perhaps this is where the “Duvel” name comes from. If I drink slowly, it fills my mouth with soapy suds. If I drink fast, it burns my throat and then fills my belly with soapy suds. (At this point I am wishing I was drinking a Miller High Life.) Grade: 1  Overall: Very disappointed. The smell is a turn off. The taste is a mix of weird and underwhelming. And the mouth is simply unbearable. In the name of non-abuse toward alcohol I will not dump it, but I may try to turn it into the bottom half of a black and tan in hopes of finding a redeeming use for this stuff. (That could be disaster, but it can’t be worse.) I have had Belgian whites and Belgian tripels before, and have liked both, but this particular beer is just not my style. It reminds me of everything I dislike about Pilsner Urquell multiplied by two. I have three more of these, so I may re-review when I am in a forgiving mood.

Enormous, fluffy, densely packed white head which forms a rocky, tight (yet still large) cap of foam as it collapses. Amazing belgian lace on the glass. Truly one of the most beautiful pours in beer.  Aroma-Most prominent is the yeast character, with light, spicy phenolics and some fruity pear and earthy yeast notes. Lightly sweet bready pils malt presents as well along with some perfumy alcohol. Light floral hopping. Pleasant and very clean.  Flavor-Just the faintest bit of malt sweetness with notes of fresh hay and sourdough up front which fade quickly to strong, spicy yeast phenolics. There's just a hint of estery fruit in the mid-palate, along with pleasant spicy/floral hop flavors. Hop bitterness is moderately low and the finish is quite crisp and dry with slight peppery alcohol and earthy yeast character which carries into the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel-Medium body with very high, effervescent carbonation and a bit of carbonic bite. Alcohol is not hot, but leaves a pleasant warmth on the palate.

A - Poured from a bottle into a Duvel tulip glass, pours a golden color with hints of amber, cloudy, and about 3 fingers worth of very foamy head. Great retention, awesome lacing. Plenty of carbonation. In short, it's gorgeous.  S - Kind of bready and yeasty. Notes of banana with some very subtle (not at all bad) alcohol smells.  T - Very sweet, like a wheat beer. The yeast is very noticable, and the banana from the nose is present, but only slightly. Kinda hoppy finish brings a very nice balance to it.  M - Very bubbly. Almost too much for my taste. Alcohol burn is somewhat noticable, but only near room temp. Very, very dry finish, like champagne or white zin.  O - I can see why this beer is so popular, but it's hard to justify $17 for a 4-pack for anything other than special occasions.

Very light and wonderful. Light spices.  M - Very well balanced with super high carbonation but medium body which makes this crispy brew very drinkable.

Lacing is excellent. Deep clean funk in the nose. Balanced like a tightrope walker. Tastes soo clean. It's not the beer with the most depth ever, but I have to give it a 5 for sheer excellence. Mouthfeel is unreal. So much energy. Perfect. It only gets a 4.5 overall because it's quite expensive in these parts--a 4 pack for $16.

222,695,thehyperduck,4.57,"330 mL stubby bottle from the LCBO; best before May 2014. I've never met anyone with anything bad to say about this beer, so I've been meaning to try it for a very long time. Poured into a snifter.  Pours a slightly cloudy pale golden-straw colour, with easily-visible streams of bubbles racing their way to the surface of the liquid. Looks like champagne. Topped with three fingers of thick, silky, uneven white head with legendary retention - it leaves webs of sticky lacing on the sides of the glass as it gradually diminishes. The aroma is enjoyable, with notes of lemon citrus, pineapple, pear, white grape and lots of grassiness. The usual coriander, clove, and strong yeasty qualities are also readily apparent.  Simple, elegant taste. Coriander spiciness and yeast are fairly dominant, with a bready malt backbone. Tons of light fruit flavour, almost like a white wine - white grapes, lemon zest and green apples; kind of a candied fruit feel. A bit of banana and lots of peppery spice. There is some astringency from the hops throughout the sip. A bit of warming ethanol toward the end of the sip, but in general this beer feels much lighter than it actually is. Lingering aftertaste of yeast and spice. Medium-light bodied, with only a bit of stickiness on the palate. Fairly high carbonation, and pretty crisp-feeling.  Worth the wait. With 2400+ reviews, everything that needs to be said about this beer has probably been said already. Fantastic stuff, worth a try even if you don't really like the style. I'll be picking this up again some time, I'm sure of it.  [Updated April 6 2014]  Another stubby bottle. Duvel was the first BSPA I had the pleasure of trying, so I didn't really have anything to compare it to at the time of my first review. With a few more examples of the style under my belt, I am comfortable bumping this one's score up. This is absolutely one of my favourite beers, with a fresh, zesty aroma, a straightforward (but still delicious) flavour profile, and a lively mouthfeel that begs you to take another sip - epic stuff all around.  Final Grade: 4.57, an A+.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

The staying power of the head is nothing short of amazing.  Heady aroma full of spicy phenols and esters. Banana, peppercorn, sweet grass, and a touch of citrus. Mild hints of alcohol.  Clean, crisp flavors unfold in layers. Sweet bready msugarcane cane sugar, pepper, clove and a hint of white grape. Distinctly edgy hop bitterness that frames the beer and balances the sweetness.  Full-bodied and effervescent. A high level of carbonation plays well in enhancing some of the lesser notes in the aroma and flavor. Finish is dry, and leaves you wanting more.  Simply constructed, yet so complex in execution. Drinkable with a capital D. The gold standard of Belgian Strong Pales.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

At the local bar they provide the bottle with a very large specialized chalice.  There is a large fluffy, sweet smelling head on the pour. There was about five fingers initially, and it held on for quite a while.  This beer tastes great. I could describe it, but you should have already had a bottle.

Big sticky lacing and a snowdrift head that settles slowly into tufts of foam. Beer looks like sunshine in a glass.  S- Very light and sweet, green apples and lemons, lots of yeast.  T- Crisp fruit, a bit bready and lots of yeast. Hops are herbal and linger in the finish. Yeast contributes a decidedly peppery flavor/mouthfeel to the beer.  M- Sweetness is in check and this beer has a strong, dry finish. It's strongest characteristic. Carbonation is ample.  O- I like it, but I can think of others in the style I like more.

222,695,hopsolutely,4.27,"An iconic, world class beer that continues to live up to its reputation.  Pale blonde - almost straw coloured - with yeast haze circulating through tulip glass. Head is pleasantly white, but there's a lot of it and more carbonation in the mouthfeel than I'd choose.  Aroma is the quintessential Belgian yeast, with malted grains and spices. Flavour is well balanced from start to finish. For me the Belgian yeast dominates, but there's a lot going on between the initial malt & bready sweetness to the pleasantly dry & crisp finish. Alcohol warmth is present, but 8.5% ABV is surprisingly subtle.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,maleman,4.29,"Poured from a 11.2 oz bottle (with ""best by"" dating) into a pint glass. I thought I was being careful but the pour must have been too fast as it foamed into a head at least half the glass. The head was very light and fluffy as was the lacing. The color was very pale blonde. The nose lent notes of malt and bready goodness with a hint of pepper and clove. The taste was complex with clove, grass, pepper, and resin. There was a trace of alcohol, but nothing way out front that grabs. Mouthfeel was light-bodied with greater than average carbonation. A brew that lives up to its reputation...well worth the time to find it and price to buy it.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,hoptualBrew,4.16,"25oz bottle poured unhurriedly into a Duvel tulip.  Wow, bottle conditioning shows here. Huge ass head, white fluffy cloud pillowtops chillin. A light golden color with a crazy amount of lacing.  In the nose, pale sweet, funk, earthy hops and more sweet malts. Very non-chalant, balanced, subtle brew of perfection. Taste follows the nose. Nothing really stands out here, just a slightly funky, mildly hopped, highly drinkable classic elegant beer. Belgian yeast & hops stand out most, but nothing over the top. Light body (4/10) and well carbonated, light & crisp & refreshing.  This seems to be the epitome of the style, but all in all - nothing spectacular for me (personal taste). Easily downed the 25oz bottle & hides the alcohol really well. Picked up at Total Wine & More for $8.99, might do again someday.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Some green apple-like sweetness. A big bite of spicy Belgian yeast Both a little sweet and spicy on the finish.  M- Fairly light and easy drinking for the levels of yeast, alcohol and carbonation.

222,695,AlphaFiend1,4.41,"This beer is beautiful, through and through. Bright golden with a rich head - an impressive example of head retention. Natural, spritzy carbonation forms at the nucleation point in the base of the glass. The aroma offers subtle earth tones, light fruit, and a hint of spice.

222,695,jpelder1,4.58,"750 ml brown bottle. Suggested to be drunk ""with discerning friends or good-looking strangers"".  Appearance: Poured a golden-yellow into an oversized Cabernet glass, mounds of bright white, fluffy, foamy head stick to the sides of the glass and hang around longer than the liquid.  Smell: Sour fruit (in a good way), with a good kick of hop pungency. A touch of yeastiness at the end.  Taste: Hops hit you first, a little astringent. The fruity aroma stays in your mouth, lots of alcohol warming (but less than you'd expect from 8.5% ABV). Slight yeast aftertaste, with a big dose of warming alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Bright, like a less sweet Coca-Cola. Definite bite from the carbonation. You forget the ABV until you're halfway through your glass. Beer this good shouldn't be this drinkable...  Overall: I get this one only a couple of times a year, otherwise I'd feel like I'm spoiling myself.

222,695,Dave128,4.41,"Poured from a 330mL bottle into Duvel tulip. Picked up the gift set because I've heard the glass and beer are both awesome. So far the glass has not been a disappointment. I was saving this beer for my 50th review and am certainly looking forward to it. Enjoyed after mowing the lawn on a Fall Sunday afternoon.  A - Beautiful golden hazy color with a 3 to 4 finger white foam head that lasts forever. Like 3 minutes before I was about to take a drink that wasn't all foam. A pretty thick disc of foam sits on top after that. Lacing everywhere on the glass that the beer touches.  S - Very sweet and clean. That's about all I can say. It smells so clean and refreshing. A very simple beer with high quality ingredients. The only nag I have with this beer is that it doesn't really offer much in the nose that translates into the taste.  T - Crisp and refreshing. sweet and even a little bit tart at times. I assume its a side effect of the yeast strain, but it adds a ton of character to this beer. Absolutely delicious. Its hard to put my finger on what stands out in this beer because it is so simple in ingredients, but those simple ingredients make this a killer beer. Can detect a hint of alcohol in the finish, but nowhere near what you would expect from a regular 8.5% abv beer. Bitterness is apparent on the end and I'm not sure if I taste much hops.  M - Medium bodied with airy carbonation. Some sips almost feel creamy in the mouth from the delicate foam that occurs.  O - An outstanding beer. If it weren't so expensive, this would be all that I drink. Very nice look, flavor, and refreshing qualities give this one an A.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Hazy lemon yellow with persistent, active carbonation rises to a thick, cotton candy white head that is frothed and whipped into a stiff peak of meringue that leaves reminders of it's elegance as lacing on the glass.  Aroma: pale crystalized malt, sprinkled with confectioner's sugar. A Summer field of Clover hops accents this amazingly complex nose that has an elusive medicinal quality to it.  Mouthfeel: full with a gauze like thickness.  Chardonnay like with tart, granny apples, dry green grapes, fortified with sugar and pepper. Warming alcohol is well hidden.  Notes: a special beer, uniquely Belgian. Beautiful to look at, complex, medicinal, simultaneously dry and sweet. Amazing.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Greywulfken,4.71,"A: pale gold and crystal clear, with vibrant bubbles that stream from the bottom and persist throughout the drink. The Duvel head is legendary: I call it, ""big-as-ya-want-it,"" because you could easily overfill even the most generous glass with a center-pour of this beer.  S: golden orchard fruits, earthy and bright; floral; tangy yeastiness  T: sharp, crisp, alcohol, yeast, hops, some pepperiness and spice, deeper pale fruits and darker spices orchard rich, yet with a crispness  M: astringent, tart, biting, brisk; light-medium body, super carbonation; scintillating  O: this is a classic drink - limitless in its pairings, BTW - I honestly consider this beer to be the a top 5 Belgian strong pale ale.

222,695,amphion1065,4.33,"750 mL bottle with a 06/02/14 cork date poured into a Duvel tulip.  It pours like chafed wheat, with beautiful gold throughout. It almost looks like a slightly more yellow champagne, with great clarity and visible carbonation. A 1.5-finger pure white head leaves great lacing all around my glass; wonderful retention, too. Very tight bubbles in the head. A stunning beer by any standard.  The smell is a very refreshing combination of ester fruits and pilsner malt. A sweet banana taste from the yeast comes through in the forefront, and there's a hint of lemony citrus as well. The sweetness is balanced by a distinct bread-like biscuit character. It's enticing and well-rounded, rich with several aromas in a harmonious interplay.  The sweetness from the Belgian yeast is more present in the taste. There's a lingering sweetness that seem to suggest a lot of residual sugar. Some citrus to the taste as well. There's a nice malty backbone to this - again, the pilsner malt comes into play. Some cane sugar, and maybe some pepper as well. There's a definite alcohol note as well, and the ABV isn't hidden terribly well.  Mouthfeel is great, and this is lively without being overcarbonated. Creamy yet effervescent, this is really drinkable.  A model (progenitor?) of the style, and a delicious beer at that. I'll never grow tired of Duvel.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Rschis16,4.63,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle into a signature tulip Duvel glass. Giant and dominating shock white head that dissapates very slowly, remiscent of a cloud as it goes. Leaves plenty of lacing on the way down. The beer itself has a perfectly clear, pale yellow-orange hue with lots of visible carbonation from the bottom. The smell is clean, slightly boozy and citrusy, in the form of lemon or even lime juice. Somewhat sharp in a way. Very aromatic and very enticing.  Even though I got lemon from the scent, there is a softness to the citrus taste that reminds me more of oranges. There is a white wine-like mouthfeel that sets off the very natural boozy taste. It fits the beer like a glove, becoming part of the character effortlessly. It contributes to all aspects of this beer in a positive way: smell, taste, and feel. It's present in the aftertaste, mingling in with the citrusy hops and signature Belgian yeast. The bitterness demonstrated in Duvel is light up front, with a nearly perfect little kick in the back, reminding me of a German style pilsner. It does very well in this style, balancing the booziness and citrus. The intensity of the flavors is perfect for anyone who can appreciate a beer that challenges almost every aspect of the palate, especially since that intensity manages to get more pronounced the farther down the bottle you go. The yeast strain is probably what sets this beer apart from others, giving it a unique and lingering taste in the mouth that is reminiscent of other Belgian beers I've had, but not quite the same. The mouthfeel is effervescent and bubbly on the tongue, turning to a dry and crisp finish that complements the flavors.  Overall, this is a beer that is a pleasure to just drink, and also a pleasure to analyze. Its perfectly balanced and unique. Worth the buy if you see it, especially as its almost always available unless I'm mistaken. Great beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,tonyf55,4.26,"From the classic Duvel bottle into a tulip glass - as it should be.  Visual (5): Large, lasting, foaming white head made up of large bubbles producing a heavy thick lacing. Lightly cloudy, golden semi-transparent clarity (almost like a cloudy lager). Active carbonation with a lot of small bubbles,  Aroma (4): Moderate to heavy yeasty smell; doughy. Notes of hoppy undertones including hints of citrus and herbs. Complex balance.  Taste (4.5): Slightly bitter (like a good pale ale), with the hoppy aromas coming through over the course of the taste. Leaves a light, lingering spicy aftertaste at the back of the throat.  Mouthfeel (4): Lighter body than most Belgian Ales. Carbonation bubbles are evident giving a fizzy course texture. Alcoholic finish lasts.  Overall (4): A fantastic looking beer, lacing on the tulip looks top-notch the whole way through. The clean, dry, crisp taste coupled with the carbonated mouthfeel and the warming of the alcohol combines for a beautifully crated Belgian Pale. The bottle fermentation is reflected in the smell which carries into the taste undertones. Well rounded.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Flounder57,4.73,"The 330ml beer was poured into a Stella chalice cup.  Appearance: The beer poured a two finger head that has reduced a little and left some crazy lacing along the glass. Love it. The color is golden yellow with a good sign of plenty carbonation. Can't wait to try a sip.  Smell: Fruity esters from the yeast, followed by sweet malts, banana, bready notes, and several spices I just can't to put a finger on. Still, very inviting and appealing to the senses.  Taste: Sweet malts and banans up front. Also, some spiciness, bready characters. Tastes better as it gets warmer. Alcohol is also well hidden for an 8.5% beer.  Mouthfeel: Lots of carbonation folks. As if you haven't noticed the tiny little bubbles running up the side of the glass. Very smooth and medium bodied.  Overall: I have had this exceptional beer plenty of times beer and will defintiely have more in the future. You can't go wrong with drinking one of these.

S - Aromas of toasted bread and sweet malt are noticeable first. Has a hint of coriander and a very nice floral hop presence. Mild, fruity esters are present too.  T- Dry sweetness and a subtle tanginess can be found up front. The tang lasts all the way through the finish and compliments the fruity, coriander-laced character of the beer well. Mild-to-medium bitterness hits toward the middle. Ever so slightly boozy in the finish. Has a great crisp, and dry character that makes this 8.5%-er extremely drinkable.  M - Thin body.

222,695,MasterSki,4.13,"Best before January 2014. Served in a Surly Darkness glass.  A - Three fingers of creamy white foam settle to a thick meringue of a cap, leaving splotch intricate lacework. Body is a lightly hazed white peach flesh color, with streams of bubbles visibly streaming upwards. Reference quality appearance for a Belgian Strong Pale Ale.  S - Spicy Belgian yeast, grains of paradise, some light stone and citrus fruit sweetness, hint of banana, lightly buttery pilsner malt and grain character, and a touch of candi sugar. There's perhaps a hint of alcohol present as it warms up.  T - Citrus and stone fruit character is a bit more pronounced, but otherwise the flavor is a bit more smoothed out. Grain, spicy Belgian yeast, pilsner malt. Not as sweet as the aroma. No alcohol in the flavor whatsoever.  M - The carbonation is harsh and mildly unpleasant, even when you take the style into account. Grainy, dry texture, minimal alcohol warmth, medium body, with only minimal stickiness in the finish.  D - A very good Belgian beer made on an impressively large scale. While there are other takes on the style that I prefer I would happily have this without complaint.

The first thing you notice in the glass is the giant three inch fluffy head, and then you look down to see the nice golden body.  The aroma was nice with yeast, citrus and biscuits. The taste was exceptional, complex but at the same nothing is really overpowering. You get a lot hitting you up front with the hops, yeast, malts and some citrus.

222,695,hailtotheale,3.73,"As far as beers of this style go, I've got to give this one a solid B. I've had far too many great beers that are far more preferable to this that pure-and-simple blow me out of the water in this particular style. My scale may be jaded by the Golden Ales from Russian River and Iron Fist, which have so far set my standard for this beer.  Appearance: Nothing unusual - classic golden style, clear finish, golden with a mild-brown in color.  Smell: Derived pretty evenly from hop, yeast, and malt characteristics. Nothing remarkably obtrusive about the smell, some mildly floral hop characteristics.  Taste: Average. Really about all I can say. Perhaps my favorite characteristics of this beer come from truly accentuating the yeast. Fermentation temperature issues? Not sure, but overall, I have to say that this beer doesn't quite blow my mind in taste as its American imitators do...  Mouthfeel: Great - even with extensive traveling, this beer maintains a good carbonation level, and a smooth overall mouthfeel.  Overall: Pretty good. Not exceptional.

So many flavors that I am having trouble describing them because they meld so beautifully. One of the finest tasting beers I've had in a while.

222,695,pettis,4.33,"A: Beautiful towering and craterous white head, with numerous streams of bubbles streaming from the bottom to top of the glass.  S: Pale malts, a little bit of straw, and some spicy Saaz hops. The aroma is very nice, and I wish it would come through a little bit stronger.  T: Nice mix of sweetness from the malt and sugar and spiciness from the Saaz hops.  M: Smooth, nice carbonation, though a little thin in mouthfeel.  The lively carbonation and balanced flavor profile make this beer extremely drinkable in spite of its 8.5% ABV--perhaps dangerously so! An excellent beer for those times when you're in the mood for something light in body and mouthfeel with good carbonation, but also full in flavor. This seems like a great beer for pairing with a meal.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,hoobaga,3.93,"Appearance: Pale, golden. Clear at first but gets hazier with pouring, typical of a bottle-conditioned beer. Big soapy head visible along with many small carbonation bubbles visible.  Smell: Slight spicy smell, a little touch of grass. Alcohol smell is definitely present, not in a negative way though. Citrus is also present, but not in a bright way, more of a dull citrus aroma.  Taste: Biscuity malt, slightly citrusy aroma on the top, medium spice-like taste, warm alcohol present, slight bitterness throughout (and even after). Many many flavors going on at the same time.  Overall: Very unique belgian beer, can't really say I've had something quite like this before. The Duvel brewery did a good job brewing a beer which has so many different flavors which compliments each other, somewhat like a flavor bouncing effect.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Long lasting white foamy head, looks to be very fizzy S - Grape champagne smell, followed by cloves, subtle malts in the background, smell of yeast T - Slight chaukly taste, nice combination of simple malts and hops, hint of clove in the background, slight bitterness, very clean and refreshing M - Fairly carbonated",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,StaveHooks,4.36,"Poured in a Duvel tulip.  A - Hazy golden straw with 2 fingers of delicate white foam. Awesome retention and a ridiculous amount of lacing.  S - Sweet grassy aroma, twangy Belgian yeast, soft grain, over ripened golden delicious apples at first, but as it warms up the acidity comes out make it more of a tart aroma. Unknown spice and hints of alcohol.  T - Sweet grainy malt, spicy hops, some sourness comes through the middle, with tart apples in the background. It has an herbal bite towards the end. Finishes dry and slightly acidic.  M - Medium body, moderate carbonation.  Great yeast strain! The sour and acidic qualities really make this beer stand out. It's complex but focused.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,SkitzIrish3,4.5,"I've been waiting 4 months for this beer since I last had it overseas...  Pours with an insane amount of foam (that sparkles). Patience. Straw color, damn near clear, and good carbonation.  Smells spicy, orange and lemon, but mainly green apples.  Sweet and spicy on the palate, follows the nose. It is a bit sour and has a dry bitterness I didn't notice last time that is brought out by the alcohol. Tasty stuff and a must try.  I'm not 100%, but I think this tasted different when I had it in Ireland. Not sure if shipment has to do with a slight difference (it shouldn't with 8.5% ABV). I didn't taste the banana with this glass. Maybe my palate has grown. Still really good, but not up to the standards my palate had previously regarded it.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,output01x,4.36,"Poured from a 330 mL. capped bottle (Best Before 10/2013) into a tulip glass.  A painstakingly slow pour releases a 3 1/2-finger snow white head that continues to grow and expand minutes after the pouring is complete. The body is a hazy yellow gold with torrents of energetic carbonation bubbles racing about. Thick lacing clings to the sides of the glass in globs.  Strong yeast aromas carry notes of lemon zest, orange rind, ripe green apples, and muscat grapes. The nose is slightly musty and a little sour but undeniably welcoming.  Just like the nose, the taste is filled with fruits including lemon zest and grapes. Also noticeable in the taste is some light, bready malts and light floral hops. Sweet and ever so slightly sour, the taste is light but complex. A slight alcohol warmth can be noticed growing in the back of the throat about 1/2 way through the beer.  Medium bodied with excellent carbonation, this beer is deceivingly drinkable. The body is light, crisp, refreshing, and easily swallowed. The carbonation is extremely fizzy but does not seem to adversely effect the taste at all.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Clydesdale,4.56,"A: Pours a bright, clear golden color. The massive, ivory colored head has a frothy, slightly rocky consistency. Head retention is outstanding, and gobs of sticky, splotchy lace adhere to the glass.  S: Some pale, sugar cookie-ish malty sweetness. Musty, herbal spiciness is prominent - noble hops seem to be included. Somewhat peppery. Fruity notes of golden delicious apples and ripe pears, with lesser hints of white grapes. There's also a light, perfumey alcohol presence.  T: Faintly grainy, with some sugar cookie sweetness up front. Quite spicy and musty, both from what have to be Saaz (or similar) hops and yeast phenols. Hop bitterness is a little higher than I was expecting. Fruity esters are prominent, with flavors of golden apples and pears. There's a softly tart, mildly vinous quality into the finish, along with some faint alcohol.  M: Medium-light body. Carbonation is perky, but refined. Faintly sticky at first, before a gradually increasing dryness into what becomes a crisp finish. Alcohol is present, but it drinks like a much lighter beer overall.  D: This is another Belgian mainstay I'd never had before. It's also an excellent beer, but it's a bit more pilsnery than I was expecting for the style, at least in terms of its apparent body and hoppiness. Definitely a unique and memorable brew. This is stunningly drinkable, balanced, and refined for such a hefty offering.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,mrkipling,3.46,"750ml corked bottle poured into a Trappistes Rochefort goblet.  A - Gorgeous fluffy white head, almost like marshmallow. Lovely golden hue. Tiny streams of bubbles escape to the surface from the bottom of the glass. Basically, it looks fantastic.  S - It obviously has the characteristically yeasty smell that you would expect. Citrusy, in particular lemon. Rather sweet. The smell of the alcohol peeks through as well; not so much as to be off-putting, but slightly too much for my taste.  T - I'm getting a slight sweetness, and a hint of the citrus that I can smell. It's quite refreshing, yet at the same time slightly bitter - although perhaps that's just because I favour silky smooth beers and am just developing a taste for this style.  M - I'm not so keen on the lasting impression that this beer leaves on my palate. At first it hides the alcohol content well but quickly becomes slightly too bitter. It's not quite smooth enough. However, it retains its carbonation perfectly and remains refreshing and ultimately enjoyable until the end.  O - If I was stocking up at a specialist beer store, this is not something that I would choose - I've had quite a few beers that I've enoyed far more. That said, it is definitely above average and still a very enjoyable beer. The fact that I can buy it at my local supermarket (which is not the fact with Rochefort 10, for example) means that I will undoubtedly be purchasing it on a semi-regular basis.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

T- like the smell, very honey like and lots of bubblegum and banana as well. green apple adds a tart layer, as I get some subtle champagne flavor. Just a bit metallic.  O- a classic.

The warmth from the alcohol content is ever present but very drinkable all the same.  M - High in carbonation, thin bodied. Dry.  O - Not a massive fan of this classic but I will say that it's got the typical belgian yeast grunt with a touch of booziness. Good, not great.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Callaghan,4.73,"330ml bottle poured very slowly ""unhurried"", into a tulip. Best by date of 09 2013.  A: The head is the stuff of legend. Massive 3 finger white, creamy, though lumpy head. Slowly dissipates into about 1/2 finger, and never goes less than that. Easy to bring back some also, with a slow swirl of the glass. The color of the beer is a beautiful golden, dull lemon color. Slightly hazy, about perfect. Awesome lacing down the sides.  S: Everything seems very present. Yeast is strongest, but I also smell a lot of citrus, mostly lemon. Biscuit last. There is a lot going on, it is very complex. Slightly sweet too.  T: This is my first time trying this, after reading about it on this site. I am absolutely amazed, one of the best tasting beers I have ever had. Citrus comes through pretty strong. More than just lemon, some grapefruit and others. A hit (not a mistype) of alcohol in the middle, with biscuit and yeast. Very nice indeed. Still more going on at the finish, I must say, this is amazing. I get toasted malts, light hops, and more...it all blends very well.  M: Good amount of carbonation, dances on the tongue. Solid medium bodied. The aftertaste, I think, is helped with the light coating this beer leaves on the the tongue. The taste just lingers, and it is quite enjoyable.  O: Absolutely wonderful. This beer became even better after it warmed up a touch. I don't believe it has taken me this long to try Duvel, but I am really glad I did. So complex, yet extremely drinkable. Great tingle in the mouth, with a wonderful taste. Truly a great beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,CFHMagnet,4.41,"A slow and steady pour got 3 fingers of lively and lovely white foamy head at the top of my snifter attempting to break out. Bubbles rush from the bottom to the top of the glass like an inverted avalanche. The body is a light golden color. The head takes its time shrinking to the point where I can take a sip, and never completely leaves me.  Very subtle nose as has been noted. Yeast is the strongest, most apparent scent, and is backed by a biscuit aroma with bananas and spice. They blend together very well. After a few minutes I also began to pick out a gardeny aroma that almost reminded me of a big fresh salad.  Yeast and biscuit transition into banana and salad. Cuts off with spice and a bit of hops. Actually a little sour apple sprinkled in for good measure, almost like a fermenting sour apple. Makes for an invigoratingly good character.  Medium bodied. Bubbles bite the tongue enough to tell you they are there. Easy sipper, a tad drying. Only a little bitter.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Up front are pleasant citrus notes, yeast, and toasted malts. The finish is spicy with a nice tart sweetness. Well balanced with just a bit of alcohol coming through and a hint of bitterness. Perfect taste.  M- Smooth, crisp, and refreshing. Lively carbonation.  D - This might be my favorite beer ever. Provides an all around great drinking experience.

A tornado of carbonation, and amazing lacing. Fairly clear to see through, although it changes to a little cloudy by the end.  S- The nose on this beer changes drastically from the time you first pour it until it airs out a bit. Hops, grapefruit, malt, wheat, grass, spice, some honey are what I pick up. Super complex nose, and very balanced.  T- Somewhat more smooth and malty than the nose, and still incredibly complex. Very smooth caramel malt aftertaste. Really nice taste, it seems I get something different w/ every sip. Dry hops a little on the aftertaste as well.  M- Full bodied, malt/dry hop feel on the aftertaste. Possibly the weak point of this beer, although it's still really good. Somewhat carbonated as well, although I think this is a new bottle.  O- Overall, this is an excellent beer. Highly recommended. I will continue to enjoy this one. Cheers.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,tjkinate,4.48,"I have now had hundreds of different beers, but for some reason I have never got around to drinking Duvel. After finishing a glass of this beer only a few minutes ago I realize that I was missing something special, very special.  A: I slowly poured from a 330ml bottle into a snifter and watched those bubbles go to work, eventually producing a massive soapy head as white as cloud tops. As I peered through the glass I was surprised to see how transparent the beer remained, although the numerous bubbles made it difficult to see anything clearly. As the beer settled it displayed a beautiful pale golden hue and changed from clear to hazy leaving even lacing as the beer descended deeper into my glass.  S: Initially the beer reminded me of many other triples and hefeweizens I've ran across, but that soon changed as more subtle scents poked their way through. Most notably was banana, honey and sugar, but more interesting were the undertones of wheat, grass, and spices which were not was I was expecting to find, but am glad existed.  T: Much like the smell, it took me a few sips to notice the complexity of this beer. I felt my tongue being bombarded by hops, sweet malts, grains, and spices. The experience was enjoyable to say the least.  M: Medium bodied, mild carbonation, light coating.  O: Excellent beer that I regret neglecting for so long. Please forgive me beer gods! If you were like me and saw this beer on the shelves numerous times and instead decided on something else than next time I beg you to give this beer a shot, I would doubt you would be disappointed.

I saw the beer menu, saw this beer which i never heard of and then saw it was 8.5% abv. I was in the mood for something new so I asked the waitress if it was good and she said she highly recommended it. Well, one turned into 4 and I pretty much couldn't stand up by the time we were leaving. And at $10 a pop it turned out to be the start of a pretty pricey night!  Well since then I drink Duvel every couple of weeks. I would drink it more often but its super expensive and really strong! Beside that, the gripe I have is the beer is SUPER bubbly. Bubbly to the point where sometimes I have to sit up to burp myself haha. If you see it available you have to try it.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,doktorhops,4.92,"This is my first taste of this renown brew and whilst I'll give it a shot you'll see no sympathy for the Duvel from me, I'll be going straight for the jugular.  Poured from a 750ml corked bottle into a 500ml tall chalice.  A: Straight from the cork popping you know you're in for a raging brew; fizzing out with intensity, pale orange cloudy body with a 3cm white head that dissipates to a sticky lacing around the glass... yep, that looks inviting, almost a challenge ""look at me, I'm a Tripel!"".  S: Wow! This is the first time I've taken a whiff of a beer and thought ""Is this a beer?""... there's all kind of crazy going on here; the fruitiness of a Botrytis white wine, the sharp twang of over-ripe apples, bold musky yeast aromas and a hint of sugar syrup. I hope to think the beer tastes as interesting as it smells but I'm also certain it will... it must!  T: Buy me a case of this. Again there is so much going on it's difficult to put into words, there is a flavour that hits every part of the tongue in this Tripel; dry champagne mixes with a musky yeast and sourdough body, then you're presented with some sugar and alcohol notes (with sugar covering the 8.5% alcohol) with a slight (not nearly overwhelming) hop bitterness. The end result leaves your entire mouth salivating for more, even if you didn't like the taste of this beer you would still want to take another gulp... there is an art of seduction from this Devil.  M: Medium bodied, the carbonation is lighter than Champagne and adds to the creaminess.  D: This is the beer that makes everything else pale in comparison. It's not about the flavour either, because it really doesn't even have a great flavour to it, but the way it reacts in your mouth and the effect it has in the aftertaste is sublime. I really want to scull an entire bottle of this and cap it off with another six till I pass out in total inebriation, however I cannot afford to do this and must satisfy my beerlust with mere mortal brews... this makes me sad.

222,695,Kuromaru,4.48,"Appearance--Pours a lightly hazy, pale golden with an almost unbelievably thick, pillowy white head.

It's a bit sticky, and could stand to be a little cleaner/ dryer in the finish.  Taste--Lightly toasted malts and Belgian candy sugar are the defining characteristics. Spices and yeast swim around together next, with a nice citrus zest at the end.  Overall--Spices and citrus zest cover the alcohol almost completely, which is impressive, given the relative strength. This beer is highly satisfying and approachable, and would make an excellent gateway into the wonderful world of Belgian beer.

Taste: Like the aromas, it has a nice citrucy hop taste to it, with a nice spiciness, sweet malts and a bit of yeast.  Mouthfeel: It has a high carbonation with a very nice complexity in the flavours.  Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavours and aromas. It's an overall great tasting Ale.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,BMoldy,4.23,"Poured from the bottle (Best before: 05/13) into a Fagnes glass. Slightly hazy yellow-gold appearance with an extremely fluffy, rocky white head that easily fills half the glass and sticks to everything. Very clean, fresh aroma comprising mostly delicate, grassy hops and a slight yeasty spice, while pale malt smooths everything out. No booziness at all, despite the 8.5% ABV. Taking a sip, light fruit (apples and pears) and faintly tart yeast rise first, followed by a deliciously smooth, slightly sweet, malty body. The hops are only along for the ride, hardly exhibiting any noticeable presence. Though the alcohol isn't very present at first sip –indeed, the body is remarkably light in spite of it– the beer does warm as it goes down. Relatively clean finish, with just a touch of malt and booze.  A great present from my dad, this is a brew I haven't had in easily three years. I used to remember it for its potency, but having worked my palate a bit more, I feel like I can now really appreciate its smoothness and fantastic composition. Certainly a great representation of the style, and a classic that continues to live up to its name.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Somewhat grainy -yeast and malts.  M: Tingly, clean, full and lingering flavor.  O: Rather tasty and refreshing. Not amazing, but enjoyable.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Yagman3000,4.2,"Poured from a bottle into my gigantic Duvel goblet (three cheers for a gift box set).  Appears a light golden yellow with some initial bubbling head that fades down to a foamy head. Bubbly lace rests along the sides.  Smells spicy and yeasty. A hint of black pepper but the Belgian yeast comes through big time.  Tastes of floral citrus with plenty of spice. Certainly some complex flavors with layers. Again, I have to cone back to the pepper notes as striking me as prominent.  Mouthfeel is full with a slow gentle fade out. Sour at the end. I'm a little surprised at its high level of effervescence.  Overall I haven't had a Duvel in a long time but genuinely appreciate it in the genre of a Golden. Really enjoy the spice to this beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Spicy  T: Lots of fruit. Sweet and yet gamey. Plays with lots of different flavors on the tongue. Notes of citrus  M: Smooth, not overcarbonated. Wonderful consistency for sipping, or even gulps if you love to waste money and do not feel like appreciating what you are holding.  I waited with baited breath when I tried this beer. I feared the hype was just that. But it wasn't. This beer is everything they said it would be. It tastes incredible, leaving nothing to be desired. It has depth of flavor while still remaining tasty and accessible. It is a supremely balanced beer. I enjoyed every single drop.  Also, this truly is a beer of many vocations. I happened to enjoy it after a meal, however upon retrospection I believe it would have gone very good with the meal too.  Duvel lives up to its image and is worth exploring for any skeptics wondering about the hype.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Head lingers for the first several sips and then just remains as a thin ring with an island in the center of the glass. Love the constant stream of bubbles from using the tulip.  S: Lots of spice and some phenols when the beer is first poured. Let the beer sit for a few moments and it opens up more. Some fruitiness in the aroma tinged with spicy hops and a fair amount of yeast.  T: Nice blend of light malt, spicy hops, and yeast. The hops and malt lead the way followed by some phenols and the yeast. The finish dries completely making this beer very crisp, no lingering bitterness.  M: Light bodied with a lot of carbonation.  D: So easy to have more than one after another after another due to how crisp this beer is. Sneaky and lives up to the name.

I had a friend that came back from Europe and she said at this was unequivocally the best thing she drank over there. Very much a classic girl. It reminded me of the bottle I had in the fridge and I had to go review it. Served in a Great Divide balloon glass... but I could have used the room of a Duvel signature glass for the pour.  Clear, beautiful, golden. Huge, unrestrained, wispy head. Great differentiation between the liquid and head. Great retention and lacing. This is how beers are supposed to look... except I like a denser head. Otherwise absolutely perfect.  Musky and peppery. Some dense, but bright fruits below that. Much funkier than I remembered. Complex as all heck. Different notes keep coming to the forefront. Just plain interesting and unique.  The taste is much more of the fruit, but still with emphasized muskiness. Might be a bit much for me to process at e moment... but I'm also not a huge fan of peppery noble hops. Otherwise, this would hit the A+ ranking pretty easily. Medium mouthfeel and carbonation. Quite drinkable. Quite interesting.  Duvel is a unique beer all to itself. I thi the closest thing I've had before is an Orval, but those are still worlds apart. Funky, hoppy, complex, fruity. A beer to aspire to.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,JTSbeerislife,4.33,"11.2 oz. bottle from the winter of 2010/2011 production (Best before 05 2013 on bottle), well stored in a temperature controlled environment, Poured into a Duvel Tulip with nucleation etching.  Pours a huge four finger head, effervescent, very lively, beautiful golden color, with a consistent explosion of carbonation from the nucleation point. Head settles down to a solid two fingers, and then finally after quite some time one finger. One of the liveliest Ales I have drunk. Very nice lacing on glass.  Very pleasant aroma of Belgium yeast, candied sugars, very refined, elegant, with some blonde malt in the background. Not powerful but very enjoyable.  Very crisp, highly carbonated entry in the mouth. The carbonation is very Champagne like and extremely enjoyable. There is a delicious, distinct Belgium yeast present with just a very light hint of alcohol that actually helps balance out this Ale. This is followed by light malt flavors and a bit of the candied sugar flavors so typically Belgium. There is a slight bitterness in the finish which is very pleasant and lingers with the yeast.  Overall this is just a delicious and thirst quenching Ale. The 8.5% ABV is not at all noticeable. A very refined and balanced Ale that reminds me of a fine Champagne. It seems at its best at about 45 to 50 degrees. This is not a “big” Belgium Ale and if you are looking for a very intense experience you should look elsewhere. I have overheard some negative comments about this Ale but I feel that it is exactly what it should be, not every Belgium can or should be a Triple. If you have not tried this please do so with an open mind and you will be rewarded with a very pleasant experience. I have enjoyed this Ale many times over the years and if fresh it is very consistent.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Appearance: It contains an intense, thickened golden color with carbonation visible around the glass. It looks absolutely delectable.  Smell: Sugary malty flavors and strong hoppy aromas immediately tingle the nose.  Taste: Simply amazing. It's sweet and well balanced, yet has a spicy kick to it. The high ABV is an intense factor that make this beer spark. Tastes of honey, sweet apples, canned apricots and other wonderful delicacies are very present.  Feel: It's smooth and resembles champagne, yet also has a warming and hearty effect similar to liquor. This is a beer that truly makes me ecstatic due its gentle effect on the palate and stinging rise on the throat. It is such an easy beer to drink, even with its complexity.  Overall: This is a legendary beer recipe that has been romanticized and written about to death - with good reason! How anyone could casually drink it on a weekly basis is beyond me, yet its tempting flavorful experience is a well justified excuse.

Has a thick, sudsy white head that is about 3 fingers and leaves beautiful lacing all over the upper part of the glass.  The aroma is full of spices, a little bit of black pepper, earthiness and slight citrus from the hops, as well as some wonderful light pilsner malts. The taste is very complex. Bready, spicy and bitter. There's a great balance between the malts and hops and the spices fit perfectly in here. Everything just seems to fit together the way it should and it all hides the alcohol flavors extremely well. The aftertaste leaves nice spiciness and bitterness on the tongue and each sip leaves flavors for a long time.  The mouthfeel is crisp and clean with good amounts of carbonation, there's a nice bite on the tongue from the carbonation. Even with the bite from the carbonation, there is still a nice smoothness in each sip. This is extremely drinkable, and each sip makes you want to go back for more. Overall, this is an amazing brew.

Tastes mostly of honey and orange peel up front with notes of sour green apple and pepper. Crisp pils malts are detectable in the middle. Quite sweet and a bit boozy. Finishes very dry and bitter, much like champagne.  Mouthfeel is also quite champagne-like...very lively. High carbonation. Residual alcohol and tart sweetness really stick to the palette.

Its color was dull pale straw which was consistently hazy. Its head was initially like shaving cream but later waned out to a nice sturdy foam that clinged to the side of my glass in long thick horizontal and vertical lines. It looked like shampoo suds.  The smell was to me of green apple bread. A slightly sour smell that planed out to a clean well balanced slightly sweet finish. I would like to work in this brewery if not for only the smells.  The taste was strong, clean and intense but well balanced and smooth. I tasted initially a strong but sweet yeasty tartness that ends harmonious pleasing. Smooth but slightly crisp.

T:  Big fruity esters followed by malty, caramelly sweetness.  Apples, candied oranges.   Yeasty, bready character provides a nice canvas for the flavor profile, while a touch of earthy tea is discernible throughout the sip.   Layered, complex, lots of spicy notes pop up, especially as it warms.  Satisfying back-and-forth between bitter and sweet.   Alcohol is almost completely masked.  M.  For all that going on, relatively light on the palate.  Combined with the fact there's little alcohol on the palate, this brew is dangerously easy to toss back.

You can absolutely hear the bubbles - many trails from the bottom of the glass and sustaining the head. I added a few more ounces of beer and I have what looks like a 3-D mountanous landscape of head, still 2+ fingers - Never seen anything like this before! Color is a cloudy straw yellow/beige/gold color, very unique. First few sips are leaving ridiculously thick lacing, it's like a bubble bath in there! *2/3rds done with the glass, there is a ""lace"" that is obscuring 1/3 of the glass, like a thick meringue, whipped egg-whites!  Smell - From the bottle: Ooohhh...lite pepper, coriander, wheat, yeast, citrus, slight minerals, lemongrass, and a champagne like tingle from the effervescence in my nostrils, smells complex and incredible! From the glass: more of the same as listed above, accompanied by the slightest hint of alcohol,  Taste - This is very difficult to describe, in that there are so many wonderful bready, spicy, earthy, citrusy, minerally, hoppy flavors going on hear - the balance is so perfect that there is not one that stands out on it's own, but I will try - As you tip the glass the nose fills with all these wonderful aromas. The ale tingles the tip of the tongue with tiny bubbles and you can feel this wash over the sides and back of your tongue as you sip. All of the flavors explode all over you tongue: there is a warm sweetness at the center of all of this, slight alcohol warmth (warmth almost more noticeable in the nose and sinuses), the spices and citruses are at the center of the tongue, the grassy meadows and lemongrass and a little grapefruit at the sides of the tongue, a wonderful bakery of crusty wheats and sourdoughs fill the whole mouth, the earthy flavors, minerals and hops collect at the back, and there is a slight dryness at the end of the sip - the alcohol (8.5% ABV) is hidden quite well, and is complimentary to this incredible symphony taking place, and you just want to keep sipping, experincing this perfect symphony and all of its wonderful nuances over and over again...  Mouthfeel - Wow - Can you have creamy and crisp happening at the same time? So incredibly smooth, so drinkable, such big flavors, carried so perfectly and smoothly. LONG flavors and a light dryness with pockets of juiciness in the corners of the mouth, enticing you to continue sipping.  Overall - I'm absolutely in AWE...you MUST try this incredible ale! I am now questioning all of my previous high ratings, by comparison this would get 6's or 7's. I've never seen lacing like this, the color is very close to a Witbier and is the ""weekest"" attribute of this beer, the flavor and complex harmony is unlike anything I've ever tasted before, and the mouthfeel is so wonderful, smooth, drinkable and inviting. This beer is downright dangerous in a fantrastic way - I could drink this every night - I will buy this quite often from now on.

This is the perfect blend of spice rack stuff — coriander, clove and white pepper — along with sweet blasts of pears and apples.

The Duvel glass allows you to sip even with the monster head.  S - The aroma is very light and clean. Fresh grain and the belgian yeast contributes a slightly fruity citrus aroma. A light alcohol note is detectable.  T - Nice clean pilsner-ish maltiness up front that is taken over by yeast esters (predominantly lemon) and spices (pepper and a hint of clove). A nice honey sweet note is interspersed from beginning to end. There is a nice mild herbal hop bitterness mixed with light booze in the finish.  M - Medium bodied that is very effervescent. A split second of smoothness followed by a carbonation punch. It really coats the palate well. I would like just a bit less carbonation. A nice warmth from the 8.5% ABV.  O/D - I was missing out passing this by on the shelf for so long. A great beer that typically very easy to find and equally easy to drink. I bought the 4pk gift box because it had the glass that everyone seems to rave about. I was very happy with the purchase; the beer was delicious.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,marchoftheclouds,4.45,"Picked up a gift set with 4 330 ml bottles and a beautiful Duvel snifter for only $13.99 at my local Friar Tucks. I poured 22 ounces of water to the rim of the glass, but it was a perfect fit for the 11.2 ounces of golden sunshine and the pillowy, white clouds of foam. The lacing was artful and distinct. The smell was bready and spicy ... I was expecting a bitter taste resembling a lager, but was surprised by a crisp, complex taste. I was pretty much all about thick Russian Imperial Stouts a few, cold months ago, but I'm trying new styles and finding them to be more refreshing as the weather warms up. A very memorable brew that I will surely be revisiting soon.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,tjacobs610,4,"A: Very foamy head, with a white color, the beer itself is a golden pale color. It has a lot of very thick lacing that clumps to the sides of the glass.  S: Very clean smell, with hints of yeast and malt along with a spicy aroma  T: Very smooth, it starts out very smooth and creamy tasting. It finishes with a spicy malty taste with hints of yeast and fruit  M: Very light bodied with a considerable amount of carbonation, which gives it a spicy crisp finish.  O: Great beer. It is an all-round classic with no flaws. It has a spicy crisp light taste and the smell and appearance to go with it",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,mjgooner13,4.52,"A- Golden, straw color, very nice looking beer with a fluffy white head that stuck around for a while.  S- A lot going on in the nose, sweet honey and citrus hit me first followed by a clove spice scente and some belgium yeastiness.  T- Very similar to the smell and i'm really enjoying this. Great balance of sweetness, orange-grapefruit lemon and some spice...  M- One of the best mouthfeels a beer can have, the flavor coats all areas of the mouth, it is crisp, medium body and has fantastic carbonation...some welcomed dryness at the end which makes me want more  O- An exceptional beer, has a few quality flavors that work very well together. Great smell and fantastic mouth feel. I will certainly be seeking this out again in the near future",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,steven9000,4.45,Appearance- A huge head on this one. Quite a bit of carbonation streaming up the glass with a 4 finger frothy head. The color is a murky golden color.  smell- Up front i get that Belgian yeast also with a nice spicy coriander smell. i also get some light fruit like oranges. The smell is really well rounded and smells great. I get no alcohol in the nose even though its a 8.5% alcohol brew.  taste is extremely smooth and creamy. Lots of spice and fruity esters. Lively carbonation. I must say this beer is great! It does finish a bit dry. I get some alcohol warming on the throat but i don't taste the alcohol at all.  Overall- If you like Belgian beers you will like this one. Perfect example of the Belgian strong pale ale style. Highly recommended. I must say though i would leave the yeast out of this one. I had some with out the yeast and with the yeast and the yeast diluted some of the flavors of the beer.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,zac16125,4.22,"330ml bottle, best by 7/2013, poured into a snifter  A: Pours a hazy golden yellow with a half finger widths white head (this was my first time drinking this beer and I poured slowly as the bottle instructed, but I certainly didn’t get the head I was wanting/expecting), however the head that was present had great retention lasting throughout the drink, with moderate lacing. Carbonation bubbles rush to the surface, reminiscent of champagne.  S: Distinct spicy aroma that I can’t put my finger on, possible coriander, along with some sweet smelling fruity malts with a hint a pear. Strong and very pleasant aroma.  T: Good balance of spicy and sweet characters, with an occasionally malty aftertaste. White grape and pepper characters. Hints of apple which strengthen towards the end of the drink. Hop flavors mostly unnoticeable, with only very subtle hoppy bitterness. Absolutely no alcohol dominant sips, nice job of masking the 8.5% ABV.  M/D: Perfectly carbonated, smooth, and incredibly easy to drink. Champagne-esque mouthfeel and drinkability.  O: Overall a very good beer. However, and this may be heresy to some, I would have to say I prefer Delirium Tremens and it remains my favorite Belgium Strong Pale Ale. I will have to give this a couple more tries and see if I change my mind.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,SWMeyer4141,4.58,"Appearance-This is the best looking beer, period. Poured into my snifter. Light hazy yellow. Looks extremely juicy. 3 finger white head with little bubbles. Head still continues to increase after 3 minutes. Very slowly every little bubble pops and slowly collapses. So foamy, amazing lacing. Picture perfect.  Smell-Apples with some lemon. Coriander and Clove. Some light floral notes in there, can't detect much hops at all.  Taste-Really coats the tongue, every flavor hits the tongue and leaves, then returns. Fruits such as banana, apple, and pear. Spicy and light hints of malt. Extrememly balanced and drinkable. Just enough dryness on the finish to make you want a sip immediately.  Mouthfeel-So refreshing, so drinkable. Very creamy and crisp. medium bodied with tons of pleasant carbonation. This beer could be consumed any time of the day, any time of weather, and any type of situation.  Overall-The only problem with this beer is it's gone before a blink of an eye. So drinkable and smooth. Complex but easy drinking flavors. I don't drink this beer enough, and I'm glad I bought a single at HEB today while grocery shopping. Dammit, I want another.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,txbrew81,4.58,"A: Pale golden straw color. Huge head that leaves good fluffy lacing. Carbonation and color remind me of champagne.  S: Inviting. Belgian yeast, spicy, bannana and some other fruits i can't identify.  T: Fantastic. Typical belgian taste but so well done. Spicy, tangy and fruity. Bannana and pear with some white grapes on finish. Some spicy hops throughout. Alcohol very well concealed, dry finish.  M: Medium body and carbonation. Clean and dry finish. Again, champagne like.  O: Wonderful belgian strong pale. Great strong flavors with a perfect crisp mouthfeel.

222,695,Scotchboy,4.18,"A: Pours a crystal clear golden straw color, with streams of carbonation rising to the surface. The head is 2-3 fingers and is fluffy, creamy, and stays around forever.  S: Traditional Belgian yeast characters, with tons of subdued fruitiness and spices, a tiny kick of hops on the back end, and some sweet pale malt character.  T: Just like the nose, there are hints of green apple, white grapes, pear, and a little bit of banana, along with that Belgian yeast & malt character that smells like sweet bread. Along with the spices and peppery feel there is just a hint of hops on the crisp finish. There is a very faint touch of alcohol.  MF: Light to light-medium, crisp finish, great carbonation. Doesn't linger or dry you out.  O: I like it, its honestly a good drinker and a great summer time beer. Belgians aren't my favorite but I recommend this one.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,JizackFH,4.38,"A - This beer pours a beautiful pale golden yellow. It has a nice 2-finger fluffy white head on it. The head has some nice retention, and it leaves behind a good bit of lacing on the glass. There is a constant stream of rising carbonation bubbles visible in the glass.  S - It smells of spices, belgian yeast, banana, green apple, hops, and white grapes. The smell is sweet, fruity, and I can't wait for my first sip.  T - the taste starts off with a big belgian yeast flavor and some nice spice notes. There are some nice fruit flavors such as green apple, white grape, lemon, banana, and pear. There is some hop presence, its mild, but its definitely there. The aftertaste is crisp, clean, and hardly exists. The alcohol presence is also hidden extremely well, you can hardly tell it's there at all.  M - This has a medium body and crisp carbonation. It goes down smooth, and leaves some tingling spiciness on the palate. It has a nice bubbly muted champagne feel to it.  O - This has really good drinkability. It goes down smooth, and it tastes great. overall, I thought this was a great beer, and a great representation of the style. It is very refreshing, and I could drink it all day.

222,695,Forb,3.88,"Poured from a 750ml cork top bottle....  Appearance: A beautifully clean golden translucence with a healthy carbonation.  Smell: Floral hints are noticeable but the predominant feature is the spiciness.  Taste: The taste reminds a lot of a champagne beer with the finish being mostly spices.  Mouthfeel: Well carbonated with a clean, crisp, refreshing finish.  Overall: A good solid Belgian with an easy drinkability especially noting the %.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,depechemode1983,4.3,"A - Poured into a Duvel tulip. Beer is clear light gold in color. It has a frothy white head with awesome retention and leaves patches of lacing. Has also visible champagne like carbonation.  S - In the nose you get the trademark Belgian yeast and bread notes. Along with fruits like apricot, sour green apples and pear. There is also a pleasant grainy background as well.  T - Fruity and funky. It taste of Belgium yeast, green apples and pear with spicy undertones. Finish is crisp and a tad bitter.  M - Mouth feel is bubbly and lively. Its medium bodied and with some attitude.  O - A hell of a beer. I haven't bought this beer in awhile since the price increase. I can't believe I forgot how damn delicious this beer is. One of the best right here. So damn drinkable even at 8.5% abv.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,sommersb,4.83,"Poured into a Duvel tulip from a brown 330ml bottle, best before date is 05/2013.  A: This is a beautiful beer in all ways. The color is a pleasing clear golden, with tons of bubbles streaming from the bottom. The billowy, white head is easily 4-5 fingers high - a mountain of foam. Retention and lacing are excellent.  S: A funky Belgian yeast smell is prominent, supported by crisp smells that are fruity and spicy, with perhaps a citrus character.  T: For me the taste is a 'wow' experience. The spicy, funky zing of Belgian yeast is there, along with a slight hop bitterness. The taste is not overly bitter or sweet - a good balance with a dry quality. You can feel the alcohol in the back, but this is not a boozy beer.  M: Medium body and highly carbonated, the finish is dry with lingering yeast flavors.  O: A superb beer - easy to drink and highly enjoyable. I've had Duvel many times now and it's always a treat.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,DrewV,4.97,"Poured from a 330mL bottle (7/2013 date) out of the beer fridge at 45 degrees into a Spiegelau Stemmed Pilsner (tulip) glass. Poured 3/4 straight, then swirled the remainder to stir up the bottling yeast for the final 1/4 pour.  A: Pours a cloudy bright yellow, forming a foamy white 2-finger head with a very careful pour. Typical Belgian lace clings to the glass everywhere as the head recedes.  S: Light fruit, mostly pear and apple, some banana hints, very enticing. Not much spice in the nose. Not a trace of alcohol.  T: Follows the aroma with a highly carbonated blast of light fruit and hints of banana, with a slightly peppery warming alcohol bringing up the rear. A delight for the palate. Very slight bitterness in the finish and the palate remains clean and refreshed with no aftertaste.  M: Effervescent carbonation, typical of the style. A relatively creamy consistency, but feels full due to the carbonation. Slightly dry.  O: The Devil. The Original. Not much more to add. Really delicious. Tough to find anything negative to say about this one. Complex, yet refreshing, and extremely dangerous considering the high ABV and the equally high drinkability.  NOTE: I finally got a hold of a Duvel signature glass at my local beer store and considered myself lucky until I actually drank from it. The constant bubbling from the laser-etched ""D"" at the bottom of the glass virtually guarantees that your beer will be totally flat within 20 minutes, so you better be a fast drinker. I prefer to enjoy my beer over the course of 30-45 minutes, so I intend to avoid the Duvel glass from now on. What a shame. I MUCH prefer the Spiegelau Stemmed Pilsner (tulip) glass, it's well worth the price.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

S: Spices strong on the nose with cloves and nut qualities. Sweet honey aroma with floral hints in the background.  T: Veering more towards bitter than sweet with initial lemon-like sour notes. Sweet cane sugar notes morph into a bitter dryness towards the end. Cloves and spices strong in the taste with some slight hints of nutmeg. Duvel's approach towards bitterness is very appealing, as opposed to variations of this style that are overly sweet.  M: Very nice mouthfeel with great carbonation and viscosity. Well-rounded. Great for the style.  D: Easily drinkable, and a little dangerous considering the ABV is well hidden. A great belgian strong that is quite refreshing with more of a subdued sweetness.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,JayAre46,4.45,"i found this randomly in my fridge, .750 magnum son! thanks lady friend you're fuc&*n awesome...so i figured i'd finally review instead of hammering the first one i have because its pretty typical for some reason with this one. i will say the beer was already cloudy before i poured (in of course a duvel tulip), do i care? no! anyway the color, its like this beer was God's child and he was a brilliant golden color then he disobeyed the Man upstairs and boom all the life was sucked out and he was left with a pale yellowish color of devil deathness, while angrily pushing clouds of white head to the top that leaves spotty lacing almost cob-web like.  A - the aroma i immediately get big yeasty notes, along with some earthy bitterness scents if that is possible and then some fruit highlights in the back.  T - this is a well crafted beer, its got such a perfect bitterness that is highlighted with flashes of sweet fruits especially as it warms along with a subtle alcohol presence with a squeeze of lemon, the yeasty notes are here again and pretty much throughout, the malt in this is just there for completion and is on the pale side for sure. although its the devil, it could of only been created by God. just took some solid gulps and got a green apple flavor, not sure how i missed that as it was pretty noticable..  M - is there such thing as creamy with a prickly slight crisp finish? because thats what this is. good mouthfeel, the carbonation is raging in front of the eye but it is very soft on the palate. this beer has a good drinkability although my max is a 3 thumper bottles or 1, .750 mag in a day. with that being said duvel's cousin the ""triple dry hopped"" i can drink all day everyday  O - one of my personal fav's don't care what anyone says, this beer will always have a special place in my tiny black heart. also if/when i get married this will be one brew that will accompany my beer nerds and i along with champagne for the ""outsiders"" hah....drink it",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

S - subtle pepper, moderate amount of lemon and orange peel, tons of yeasty yeast,  T - stale lemon juice, lemon & orange peel, clove, tons of fruity & sweet yeast, banana bread.  M - Crisp, lively, bubbly carbonation, well done.  O - The yeast character really takes over, which isn't really my bag, but the citrus character and solid mouthfeel are keeping me interested.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Kartoffeln,4.25,"A: Pours a hazy, pale straw-yellow with a tremendous, pillowy head of fine, champagne-like foam. Excellent retention and plenty of lacing.  S: Strongly fruity and spicy: fresh and candied fruit, banana, vanilla, and clove scents are most prominent. Yeasty, too.  T: More or less follows the nose. Bursting with fresh fruit, bananas, and particularly pronounced clove spiciness which gives way to almost-sugary tastes of dark and candied fruits. Light, somewhat grainy malts comes through gradually, and there's a bit of noble hop bitterness noticeable in the finish. The alcohol is barely detectable despite 8.5% ABV.  M: The fine carbonation is crisp, smooth, and gives it a medium body while balancing the rich, sweet taste.  D: Exceptionally flavourful and refreshing; it'll be excellent for summer days, if difficult to drink very many in one sitting due to the carbonation and ABV. Absolutely deserves its reputation as the archetypal Belgian Strong Pale Ale.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,rickyleepotts,4,"I had not even finished pouring this beer before I could smell it. HUGE nose. That’s a good thing, too. With a lot of the beers I have had in Europe, they not only pack a punch on the nose, but also with the alcohol content. This beer is just the same. With an ABV of 8.5%, you can have one or two pints of this and be feeling alright.  I just love how this beer smells. It smells light, somewhat crisp and clean… gets me excited for the first taste.  Talk about carbonation! Holy cow, this beer hits your palate like a fizzy cola. But the aftertaste is incredible. You taste the high alcohol content, but it’s not too much that you want to stop drinking. I wouldn’t call it fruity… but man, what great flavors. The bad news here is the alcohol content… it doesn’t taste like it has that high of a percentage, but you can sure feel it on the way down.  This beer would go well on a hot summer day, or in the pub with your friends after a long day at work. I really like this beer, and would totally order it again. I did learn that Duvel means devil in Flemish… I’m guessing it’s the ABV that made them decide to call it that!

222,695,kjussel,4.63,"Appearance: Surprisingly golden-yellow with a white head that lingers. It genuinely is an unearthly bright ale, that screams, ""drink me!""  Smell: Belgian esters, vanilla, banana/cloves with kind of an herbaceous scent.  Taste: Delicious, delicious beer. The herb flavors seem to jump out on the back of your tongue after you are hit with belgian goodness. The carbonation is just perfect to allow the flavors to flow over your tongue, to just linger, and then there is a satisfying alcohol flavor that lingers oh so well.  Mouthfeel: As I said, the carbonation compliments the pilsener malts and belgian flavors so much. Every flavor that you want from a belgian stick to your tongue and hang on just long enough.  Overall: Truly the class of its style, in my opinion. As good on a summer day as it is hunkered in on a cool, rainy evening (which is often in Seattle).",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

It may sound strange, but I also noticed a minute bubble gum taste as the beer warms. The 8.5% ABV is very well hidden.  Mouth feel: The dryness followed by a high amount of carbonation is refreshing while the beer is both slightly chilled and warm. It feels fully bodied and heavy throughout the entire experience.  Overall: This is one of the most well balanced beers I've ever had. I almost never fail to have at least one bottle in stock and feel proud to have finally reviewed it.

It has a yeasty, lager-like aroma with hints of pears, apples, pine, and a slight whiff of ginger.  The first thing you notice when you taste it is a pleasant fruity sweetness, which gives way to a nice champagne-like dryness. This beer is very heavily carbonated, which accompanies the dryness very nicely. The dryness also helps to balance the alcohol, which while high at 8.5%, never lends any real booziness to the beer.  A wonderful drinking experience. A little pricy in this neck of the woods to enjoy regularly, but certainly a nice occasional treat.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Mouthfeel is again, crisp and tart with a very lively feel from the robust carbonation. Refreshing and dry. Overall a very nuanced, delicate ale with some very distinct, interesting flavors.

222,695,BarryMFBurton,4.85,"This isn't the first time I've had Duvel - but it's the first time I've poured one during a royal wedding. To William and Kate - cheers!  A: A pale gold body, letting about 80% of light through. Foamy as hell. The bottle says ""Pour Unhurriedly,"" and boy do they mean it. A bubbly white head w/ sticky lacing forms almost instantly.  S: In the nose, there's a strong yeast presence. Phenols abound, with a complex, fruity sweetness underneath. Very Belgian.  T: Yeast, just like the nose, conquers the palate. Big fruity flavor - grape, apple, pear, banana, and orange marmalade make an appearance. The hops are there, but mild; uniquely spiced. The aftertaste is so crisp it's almost nonexistent. Spectacular balance for 8.5% ABV.  M: A bubbly, classy champagne feel. It gives this beer an exquisite texture that I've never experienced anywhere else.  O: The KING of Belgian Strong Pale Ales for good reason. It's a great beer for so many occasions. It's so hard to find anything bad about this drinking experience. I love it!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Delicious. M- Medium bodied, but on the lighter side. Smooth but crisp with a dry finish O- This is a great beer, and that is an understatement.

222,695,zeledonia,4.33,"The only way to christen my new Duvel tulip is, well, drinking Duvel out of it. So here we go.  Pours a pale golden yellow, translucent, with a fluffy white two-finger head that lasts and lasts, leaving clouds of foam on the sides of the glass that go way beyond lacing. Doesn't get a whole lot better than this.  Smell is that charismatic spicy Belgian yeast aroma with some gentle grassy hops. Slightly fruity, and very well-balanced. I could drink in the smell of this all day.  Taste is slightly hoppy up front, followed by a smooth subtle sweetness with a touch of sour, with tangy spice in the finish. A very nice balance of hops, malts, and yeast flavors. This is not a ""kapow"" beer, but it's not weak either. The flavors in it meld together very well and build a cohesive drink.  Medium-bodied, kinda light but sticky, with medium-high carbonation. The mouthfeel goes really well with the flavor.  I really like this beer. Everything about it is solid, and there are no obvious negatives. And all the pieces fit together really well. I really can't think of how I'd improve it.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,taylocd,4.26,"This beer was from the 330ml bottle with a 'Best Before' date of 09 2013, and a lot ID of L1951 0441.  Appearance - The brew initially poured up a mostly clear yellow gold, but as with many bottle conditioned beers, it was clouded by the final bit of liquid from the bottle. The head was a tall, porous, and bone white. It left great lacing that clung to the tulip like meringue. The head was reduced to about an eighth of an inch by the last sip, but, importantly, it did remain throughout the session. 4.5 of 5  Smell - From the bottle, this one had a truly fantastic 'Beer Aroma' that was much more than I expected from the small bottle opening. Unfortunately, I can't adequately describe that great inital aroma, so I'll just leave it at that. Once poured, it seemed to lose some of that powerful smell, but if did have a sort of spicy (peppery even?) phenolic scent. 3.5 of 5  Taste - The first sip of this one had a prominent hop bitterness, but as the beer warmed, that characteristic gave way completely to the spicy and almost peppery flavor that matched the aroma. The taste that did linger, however, again hinted to the hop bitterness. It had a very complex flavor, without being overpowering in any way. 4.5 of 5  Feel - The carbonation level was as close to perfect as I can imagine. The balance of the beer was ever-so-slightly thin, but it made for a very easy drinker, even at 8.5% ABV. The beer finished very crisply. 4.5 of 5  Overall - The only part of this brew that didn't overwhelm was the aroma, but even that was still better than most. 4.5 of 5",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

S: Slight puff of Belgian funk, banana, and pears, along with nice yeasty, sweet bread-like presence.

M: Bubbly and spritzy.... like a fine champagne. The sweetness was kept in check and the lacing was moderate at best.  O: Flavor-packed, highly drinkable, and flat out delicious.

Big Belgiany aroma that at first reminds me of pineapple. Smells semi-sweet, almost like a bread dough. Carbonation translates to a very fizzy mouthfeel that isn't unpleasant. Taste is of lemon grass with some spicy hop character in the background. Malt profile is deftly handled with the beer sliding more to the bready side of the spectrum. Taste finishes with a light sourness and is very dry. There's a little bit of alcohol warmth the more you drink it, but that's certainly welcome for the style.

The beer seemed to taste like metal or blood each time I took a sip, don;t know why but it kind of sucked at the time.  After trying this again a year or so later I found that this beer is a gem. It's just about as much of a Classic as Chimay or St. Bernardus.  The beer pours out with a bright yellow hazy color with a big foamy head on it. This beer is a lively one. The aromas of Belgian Yeast and some funk with booze mixed together. Some intense hops are on the nose too. The taste is quite bitter and it stings the tongue with lots of needle like sensations on every sip. This beer is really worth trying, every now and then you need to let the Devil loose!

Crisp and I would even say zesty even.  Taste - The malts in this are wonderful, somewhat crisp and tart, gets the jaws tingling. Nice, dry, fruity flavor, wheat, some alcohol. Very refreshing.

222,695,WalterWalter,4.03,"This was my first time trying Duvel. Served from a bottle into a glass goblet, at around 10C. Nice head forms with a relatively non-aggressive pour, dissipating over about a minute to leave a fair bit of lacing that persisted. Nice bright semi-opaque yellow colour with a hint of orange.  Smell and taste are subtle but pleasing. Fruity and sweet, doesn't pack the intense malty-alcohol flavour punch of many other strong Belgian beers, but instead is subtle with sweet / fruity tastes and not much alcohol taste. Bit of hops and some pleasant sourness. I'd describe it as a complex mix of simple tastes - nothing on its own is a particularly novel or interesting flavour, but there are a lot of subtle simple flavours mixed together fairly well. Not as strong in flavour as I would like, however.  Mouthfeel is very interesting; light and frothy, like the fizz from a fizzing candy. Very unique among beers that I have had. Carbonation therefore seems fairly strong, but not biting.  Aftertaste is again very mild with subtle fruits.  This beer has very nice flavours, which are very attenuated compared to more flavourful Belgian strong ales. It reminds me somewhat of St. Bernardus Tripel in its subtlety, but a bit less interesting than that beer as the tastes presented are somewhat simpler.  Overall I prefer strong Belgian beer tastes to be a bit less subtle, but the mouthfeel and drinkability of this beer are superb, so I rate it 4.5 overall.  I will definitely drink it again.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,ommegoose,4.53,"11.2 oz. bottle.  Classically beautiful beer in the namesake goblet. A few inches of head stay strong for a while, but even when they give way, chunky lacing remains. Coats the glass with a perfect while sheet when I tilt the glass. The colors are like a lemon meringue pie in the glass.  Lovely aroma. Crisp, zesty, flowery, herbal, earthy. Notes of lemon zest, doughy bread, fresh cut grass, and some pepper.  Malty and dry, but never puckering. Just a hint of tartness in fruit notes of white grape, apple, pear, and lemon. Strong yeast profile that's peppery, grassy, and almost like a buttery sourdough bread. Touches of grassy German hops add some bitterness. It all blends perfectly.  Feel is impossibly soft, and it's almost like the beer isn't even there. Tingly at times, but mostly sits like an airy beery foam in the mouth. Given some additional time to flatten, it stays very delicate and extra smooth.  Classic beer with good reason. I loved it the first time, and after having a lot more beers, my opinion is not diminished at all. It calls for sip after sip, and is a good thirst quencher to boot.

Little to no bite, which is impressive given the ABV.  Taste: Coriander, Lemon, wheat, refreshingly alcoholic. The coriander lingers and becomes sweeter.  Mouthfeel: Light, carbonated.

222,695,jazzyjeff13,4.53,"It's my 100th review, so I thought I'd better dig out something special. Duvel hits the spot - I don't have it that often but it's always good.  A 330ml stubby bottle with a BB of Sept 2013. The label states that it is bottle conditioned and matured for two months.  Poured into a Stella chalice (yeah, it's about time I invested in a Duvel chalice...). A hazy pale golden hue with visible yeast towards the end of the pour. Profuse fine carbonation results in a column of bubbles rising from the centre of the glass. Produces a massive foamy white head with the consistency of meringue; this is the standard by which all other beers should be judged. The head lasts quite a while before reducing to a surface layer. Aroma is sweet and complex: lots of upfront yeasty, ester and banana notes as well as a considerable whiff of alcohol (which increases as it warms).  The taste resembles the aroma but an order of magnitude more involved. The overall impression is a light estery sweetness with a mild sour character. Distinctive notes of bananas and yeast with hints of almonds, marzipan and pears. An alcohol note is present, lending warmth and a tingly astringency to the flavour. The booziness becomes more evident upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is silky smooth, coating the palate and leaving the mouth dry. Aftertaste of yeasty notes and ethanol.  A classic, and worthy of being ranked among the world's best beers. The flavours are both intense and subtle, but never overwhelming. It is also highly affordable, and should be on every beer lover's drinking list.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Its smell is just as intense as the carbonation, with strong fruit and floral hop notes dominating. The Belgian yeast also comes into play, along with a bit of bread.  I wasn't at all expecting such an up-front bitterness to this beer. Even at the front of my tongue its apparent. The taste retains the floral qualities of the smell, but introduces new flavours like apple and lemon.  The carbonation really comes into play in the mouthfeel to bring the smells and flavours together in this well-rounded beer. Its quite smooth and is about halfway up the scale for dryness.

This beer pours absolutely beautifully, pale yellow in color with a massive and I mean massive head. Citrus aromas followed by spicey wheat notes with some astringency that kind of stings. Tastes a bit like a boozy wheat with spice. Citrus notes in the taste are nice. This beer suffers from being stingy on the mouth for me and it's not really enjoyable.

222,695,NJIPA,3.95,"Served out of a bottle into a Duvel tulip glass  A: The beer pours a clear gold with a huge head.  S: I mainly pick up the yeast ester and phenolic smell that is normally associated with Belgian yeast (a little more subdued). I pick up the faintest bit of floral hops as well.  T: At the forefront is the yeast flavor of the beer. It imparts a slightly sour green apple flavor with some spiciness. There is also the some amount of a floral hop bite to balance the beer, but definitely plays second fiddle to the yeast. The alcohol is really hidden and does not belie its high abv.  MF: I love the mouth feel of this beer. I wish all beers with light malt flavor and light bodies could have this mouth feel. The beer is super carbonated, and is thinner than you would think for a beer with 8.50% abv.  Overall: Duvel is a refreshing, light bodied beer. It is very sessionable, to the point where it could get you in trouble.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,robbrandes,4.46,"pours an impossibly crystal-clear straw color. the bubbles are as fine as you will find in a beer, crazy lacing on the sides of the glass. Nice fruity, estery nose, more subtle than a lot of belgians, but deceptively so; there's a ton going on here.  Great blend of floral hoppage, but enough spiciness to really make the back-end explode on the palate. Only real complaint - I think it's slightly over-carbed, but not distractingly so.  Impossibly drinkable beer, sessionable to the point of getting into trouble!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,JMad,4.46,"I poured an 11.2 oz bottle into my tulip glass...  The beer pours a pale, golden, yellow colot with an extremely lofty, bubbly, white head. It smells of apple and apricot with a hint of spice in it. The taste is a bit tart with hints of green apple, some banana and a leafy, bitter aftertaste. The beer is light but full bodied with lots of sharp carbonation. It's warming and has a dry finish. I thought the Duvel was great, I'd drink it any day, it's refreshing and light enough for warm weather, and it's nice and warming if it's cool outside.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Carbonation is obvious.  S - Maybe a strange way to describe it, but it smells very clean. Not soapy, but clean. A little fruity, maybe apricot.  T - Sweet, not pungent. Some awesome flavors...Belgian goodness. Still a bit of fruit, not sure if it's apricot. Strangely enough, I'm picking up a bit of cucumber. Very pleasing.  M - Highly carbonated. Very interesting. Crisp.  O - What a really good beer. Very flavorful, very drinkable. Really enjoyed it.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,77ships,3.63,"Have been drinking this one for a while, it is very common & well-known in Belgium, the first non-macro/ fizzy yellow beer I tried, I don't drink it that much these days, I used to be more exited about it but it is still a nice beer:  A: big fluffy white head that sort of collapses instead of disappearing, always nice to see, slightly but not much hazy yellow, cool glass S: strong smell of hops, floral, yeast, hint of citrus/lemon peel T: yeast, clean bitter hops (strong by Belgian standards), hint of sweet malts, lemongrass, slight alcohol bite in finish M: lot of carbonation, dry finish D: given the abv, this one is not hard to drink, easy even, hard to believe for me actually how hyped this is in the States",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,beerprovedwright,4.82,"There was some real pressure in this 750ml corked bottle. Opened like a bottle of champagne. Big four finger head of soap suds looking bubbles, pure white. Very good looking lace with lots of clinging power. The color is a 4 on the SRM beer color chart, but don't let the color fool you, this is some fine beer, not a light beer. Smell is a bouquet of savory fragrances: apple, spices, pepper, and sweet malt. Flavor is what a beer should taste like; clean tastes of apple, spices, sweet malt, and just the right amount of citrus. Very creamy and full feeling in my mouth as I savor every taste. Warning: Drinking the complete 750ml bottle at one setting will put a real hurt on you. I had no idea by the flavor that this beer was hiding a mule kick. Drink this wonderful beer when you have nothing to do for a good three hours, because you won't want to do anything for that time...maybe want another...but that is a whole new story.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,JCaweinstein,3.05,"Look: Poured from a 330mL bottle with a best before date of 05, 2013. The color is pale yellow with a thin white head that remains throughout. Lots of carbonation coming up from the bottom and sides of my snifter glass.  Smell: Strong aroma eminated from glass as I poured it, gently into the snifter glass. Smells of sweet fruit, yeast, and as the beer warmed I picked up some grassy notes.  Taste: Bitterness, very citrusy with faint notes of the yeast. As the beer warmed I also picked up grassy notes and a bit more malty sweetness.  Mouthfeel: Crisp is what really comes to mind here. The carbonation in combination with the crispness gives it a very dry feel. The alcohol does not come through eventhough this beer has an ABV of 8.5. Mouthfeel reminds me of a dry white wine.  Drinkability: Too much carbonation in combonation with bitterness for me. Don't think I would have more than 1 of these during a session.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,bobhits,1.86,"Recalling the massive head this beer pours I poured about as carefully as humanly possible into my snifter. Either this beer is old or I am pretty good at this. Tall white head built from somewhat larger bubbles over a pale and honestly pretty yellow body. The head being kept by multiple streams of bubbles racing to the top. There is a haziness to the body I can only assume comes from yeast.  The nose is dominated by a dry fruity yeast aroma. Mixed in with the yeast are hops but I can't tell which aromas are which here.  Citrus flavors finishing with a dry yeasty finish. Some cloves and a few others spices here as well. There are certainly some flavors here I cannot place, but they are subtle and frankly nothing here excites me what so ever. Where I find Duvel Triple Hop rather exciting, the regular is simply bland and lacking to me.  A very dry and high abv drink here that isn't refreshing. The carbonation requires one to drink slowly or burp uncontrollably.  Medium-thick bodied, but the just insane amount of carbonation on the tongue makes this beer feel very different. Unlike some beers that become creamy form that carbonation this one becomes drier as a result.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Two fingers tall and leaving stunning lacing. It sticks as mountains, lovely. Slightly cloudy yellow colour.  S - Strong lemon and yeast aroma. Lot's of citrus. Nice.  T - Same as aroma with lemon, yeast, and citrus. Quite zesty. Not overly complex, but there shouldn't be a correlation between complexity and quality.  M - Medium carbonation and mouthfeel Really, really smooth going down.  D - Awesome on this. Maybe better with some age than fresh.

The aroma was of a soapy yeast, herbal hops and a straw malt with notes of a blend of spices. It tasted light and mildy acidic in the beginning and finished with a nice light bitter hop flavor.

S - Light apple, maybe pear, and yeast.  T - Sharp and crisp, big juicy apple throughout the drink and on the finish. The ABV is obnoxiously well hidden.

222,695,Spider889,4.61,"The last of my bottles gifted by my wife for Christmas - though the tulip that came in the gift set is the gift that continues to give! Live review.  It is an awesome sight to pour Duvel into a signature Duvel tulip. This is one of those beers where I really have to take issue with how the Bros re-arranged the scoring weights. This beer looks so exquisite it really deserves more credit.  The pour yielded a three finger tall eggshell white head. The foam is as frothy and dense as any beer I've ever seen. The retention is seemingly everlasting, and the lace is a wondrous three dimensional exercise in Belgian beer perfection.  The liquid itself is crystal clear, the color of pale straw. Intensely vigorous carbonation is visible emanating from the laser etching.  The smell is at first simple, but with some consideration it is also well crafted. Deep layers of sweet tart yeast lend an almost funkiness to the brew, while more traditional notes of clove and cracked pepper assure you that this is a Belgian pale.  The flavor leaves very little to complain about. In fact, I have no complaints, I only wish there was a little more hop oomph. There's an almost hefeweizen type of sweetness there - light banana and clove esters. Then the hops jump in and add very clean bitterness. The malt is crisp and smooth, all pale and doughy.  Very highly carbonated - the bottle itself proclaims to ""pour unhurriedly."" The carbonation is spot on for the style though, and the beer itself isn't too strong or heavy as to cause any of the issues higher carbonation can sometimes create. The beer is slick and clean, with no real lingering dryness or stickiness, only the residual bitterness from the hops.  Very drinkable, this was the first Belgian beer I ever liked, and is still easily one of my favorite readily available imports.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,jboucher,4.57,"11.2 oz bottle poured into a Duvel tulip goblet.  Appearance: Light golden pale hue. Excellent head with nice retention and great lacing. Good carbonation. Good clarity for being such a yeasty beer.  Smell: Fresh lemongrass, apple, pears, spice, and yeast. This brew has a very complex nose about it. Very intriguing.  Taste: Lemongrass, apple, and pear notes just like the nose. Hops are not overpowering. Malty sweetness. Spice and yeast blend. Wonderfully complex. The alcohol blends in nicely and is masked by the other characteristics.  Mouthfeel: Crisp and refreshing, this medium bodied brew makes you want to come back for more. Solid carbonation.  Drinkability: Highly drinkable, I could drink this all day. Goes down very easy despite the 8.5% abv.  Ending notes: One of the best (if not the best) that I've tried of the style. Would get again in a heartbeat. Overall, a very refreshing and enjoyable brew.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

The head has lots of texture and retention.  Smell - Slight corn and wheat scent, slightly grassy. Nothing pronounced.  Taste - Corn. Sharp bitter aftertaste puts a damper on an otherwise awesome pale ale. Alcohol really shows in the finish. Surprisingly hidden, considering the ABV. Slight lemon peel finish.  Mouthfeel - Great carbonation.  Drinkability - Best taste for any pale ale I've had. If it wasn't for the aftertaste, this might have made it on my regular rotation. But, grading it in style, it's absolutely great.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,joannavandenhaag,4.1,"Appearance: A clear, inviting yellowish gold with nicely active but reasonable carbonation; fluffy white head with thick lacing.  Smell: Top notes are crispy spiced fruit on a butterscotch toffee core with earthy honey malt base notes. Sweet, but plays well with others, maybe a bit less well with salt than savory.  Taste: Duvel lives up so well to its aroma. It begins with a crispy freshness with a nice apple nut caramel core and a sultry roasty toasty finish with pleasant bitterness. The refreshing flavour masks the very high APV. Peppery, crispy, chewy mouthfeel with nice carbonation.  Drinkability: Duvel is so nice! My only (half-)complaint with this beer is that it is too easily drinkable.  A headache recipe- Turn the Duvel tulip glass upside down and place on top of the bottle, then invert. Slowly, slowly, slowly lift the bottle up for the perfect head ratio. Repeat about 2-3 times over the course of an evening.

I've had amazing experiences with other beers but this will always have a special place in my heart.  Appearance- Pours a golden color with a nice head. It's color has a refreshing quality that invites a lustful first sip.  Smell- Hits your nostrils with crisp, fruity notes.  Taste- The balance of alcohol, malt and fruit notes are seamless. The alcohol in this brew is instantly acknowledged but doesn't stop you from enjoying the other notes. Unreal.  Mouthfeel- Maybe I love this beer as much as I do because I've always enjoyed champagne and Duvel encompasses all that I love about champagne. The carbonation is strong with being overpowering. The liquid has weight but doesn't weigh your mouth out.  Drinkability- This is my favorite beer. I love the crisp, enticing flavors. It's got the fresh, invigorating appeal of just cut fruit. The alcohol flavor is balanced and enjoyable. You know right away you're drinking a formidable beer but it doesn't knock you over the head... right away.

Hops are clearly detectable at times and their bitterness is nice balancing to the malt sweetness. The end is drier and maybe a bit more bitter. Very nice  M- This is what i love with this beer. The crispness is quite strong for the style but still delicate, and gives this beer a refreshing character that is not to be found easily in other strong ales. Clean but still enough complex  D- Clean, fresh, a really pleasant beer. Extremely drinkable given its ABV  This is an excellent and flawless beer.

Initially, it is dry and hoppy with a bready taste. The aftertaste is sweet and fruity, but it isn't too much to handle. Additionally, you can taste the alcohol, but it is very subtle.  Mouthfeel: Crisp with fairly high carbonation. Medium body.  Drinkability: The head and retention is at its best, from what I have seen, but it would look far more impressive if it wasn't so murky. This is only a small price to pay for a beer with such a complex taste that isn't overpowering in any individual aspect, accompanied by a mouthfeel that is beyond satisfying.

222,695,Satchboogie,4.36,"750ml Caged and corked bottle (2010 vintage) poured into a Duvel Tulip. This is beer review #100 for me.  A: Pours a hazy golden pale yellow, massive 3+ finger white bubbly head that sticks around forever and becomes rocky. Leaves magnificent lacing.  S: Floral hops, funk/tart, belgian yeast, bread, a little booze, white grapes. Hops almost have a german pilsner aroma.  T: Initial flavors are of slightly tart fruits: pear, a little green apple, slight apricot, banana, and a little white grape. Hops are floral and a little grassy, verging on classic pilsner taste on the end. The flavor then shifts/incorporates the belgian yeast and malt. There's a little funk, malt is very lightly toasted and is almost like a fresh loaf of sour dough. The flavor is bright, golden, has great depth and complexity, yet seems as light as a pilsner. Finish is slightly dry, clean, fairly hoppy (just a little bitterness), and mellow. Alcohol pops it's head out just a bit, but is otherwise unobtrusive.  M: Medium carbonation (a lot goes to the head), the body is fairly light, though it does have a little viscosity to it as it does coat the mouth. Even with the bubbly carbonation it's damned smooth.  D: A 750ml bottle is more than enough for 1 person, the first glass went down extremely easily but I did start to feel the effects on the 2nd glass and final pour. This is probably one of the better beers available in NH, I can see the smaller bottles becoming a staple in my fridge for somewhat 'special' occasions.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,JohnnyChicago,4.46,"Poured from a squat bottle into a Duvel tulip.  A: Its been said before, Duvel has maybe the best pour in the beer world. Gigantic fluffy head that sticks around forever, but somehow doesn't get in the way of your drinking, when you tip the glass.  S: Breadiness, funk and hops are all present.  T: Just heaven in a glass! The perfect balance of sweetness, tart, funkiness and hop bitterness.  D: Drinkability is spot on for a beer of this strength. Alcohol is well-hidden, but the richness of the flavour prevents you from pounding them.  Overall: What to say that hasn't already been said. If you love beer, you must drink this one. Buy the glass, buy a bottle (or 20). This is a great ""Champagne beer"". Drink it with someone special.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

The scent is of citrus, alcohol, and some yeast.  The taste is of apple, citrus, alcohol, light hops, and yeast.  Light bodied, very crisp, high carbonation.  Very tasty beer, lots of interesting flavors here, the alcohol can be strong at times but it is well balanced with the other flavors. Also very easy to drink.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,zhanson88,4.26,"Well it's about time I finally gave this one a try after months of having access to it. Poured into a tulip glass.  Appearance: This is probably the most gorgeous pale beer I've seen up to this point. It's a hazy, bright, pale straw color with a full 3 fingers of egg-shell white head. Retention is ridiculous, and lacing is incredible. Superb.  Smell: I get hints of green apple and pear, with Belgian yeast and slightly citrusy esters. A very nice smell.  Taste: Up front I get some tart green apples and a bit of pear, with that Belgian-type quality and citrusy esters on the back end. Finish is dry and slightly tart. This beer does a great job having good flavor without being too sweet (or very sweet at all for that matter).  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer is definitely light bodied with a good deal of carbonation. It seems to fit in perfectly with the other qualities this beer has. It's incredibly drinkable. Great brew, no surprise it's a classic.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,RichScherle,5,"This is the absolute king of belgian ales. No other ale i've tried anywhere comes close to the way these brewers are able to get such a bone dry feel with such power and finesse. They have a good secret.  A - Straw pale yellow which in itself is unique for such a high abv brew. I've heard that duvel uses a proprietary steaming process to cook the malt which allows the barley malt to retain the lightest color (everybody else roasts the barley into malt). Also, the head is famously huge, pillowy and voluptuous - Like beautiful crisply white clouds.  S - Awesome yeasty character that is often imitated but NEVER duplicated exactly. Its like a dry sweet smell with a unique almost mineral like yeast aroma. Literally you can smell the dryness of this brew.  T - Elegance at its finest. Dry upfront malt with slight hop balance and finishing equally as dry - with the unique yeast character coming through. The yeasty taste is mindblowing and hard to describe - almost like a shimmering, mineral-ness. Reminds me of a very very fine champagne almost with the fine bubbles and shimmering effervescence  M - The BEST mouthfeel of any belgian ale imo. I don't think any other brewery has accomplished what these guys have - the dryness yet with such body and flavor and abv is truly a triumph. Very sharp and totally awe inspiring.  D - I could drink these with no problem even with the high abv. In fact, i've been known to sit and drink a whole 4 pack by myself in an evening - awesome awesome awesome brew. The dryness which is so beautiful keeps the beer totally drinkable and never boring or tiring.  World class and a triumph of modern brewing technology. I would classify this beer as one of the top 3 in the entire world.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,gdrydenc,4.52,"Poured from a shorty into, fittingly enough, a Duvel tulip. First time this tulip has ever held its namesake!  A - Light to mid golden straw colored with 2 fingers of thick head that collapses into large pockets of foam. Lacing throughout, an excellent looking beer!  S - First off, interestingly complex. Effervescent and very fruity. I absolutely pick up on the Belgian characteristics of this beer.  T - Very cool. Tastes somewhat like a tripel, which I like. I absolutely taste the fruits in this, very reminiscent of similar Belgians I've had. Peppery and fruity are the two flavors I see the most of.  M - Similar to a tripel, with large, robust bubbles. Each small sip fills my mouth quite a bit, which is cool.  D - Very drinkable for such a flavor complex beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Great biscuity maltiness. Highly drinkable.  One cannot say enough great things about this beer. All other Belgian blondes/goldens cannot touch this one. Thank you, Duvel Moortgat for this gem.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Wegomlegging,4.36,"Poured young and correctly, crystal clear and fresh with a white afro of head scraped straight across. Nice hop smell without the tired piney stank. Flavor is exactly what you would look for in a Belian ""devil beer"" (Lucifer, Judas, etc.). Dry, quenching, lightly spicy and yeasty. If there's a comparison, chamagne would be close in texture. I'd argue this is the benchmark model, as there's incredible balance here. Having had aged versions, I prefer the fresh version much more for drinkability. After being fortunate enough to get a tour of this brewery, the beer pouring class at the end was very fun. Free beer wasn't bad either. Shhh...the Duvel is sleeping.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,airheadmtrcycle,4.67,"Is it fair to review a beer right after having a Bell's Hop Slam? I'm gonna try to be fair. I've had quite a few Duvels before, so I should be able to pull it off.  Duvel is an opaque golden ale with mountains of frothy head that leaves plenty of lacing. Smells of fruit, bubble gum, bananas, lemon peel and more. Taste is bright and fruity with a sparkling mouth feel.  One of the best beers I've ever had. It's amazing how readily available and how relatively inexpensive it is.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,sixerofelixir,4.6,"330 ml bottle. Best before date clearly shown on the bottom left of the back label. Served in a Duvel tulip glass that was in the gift set I just got.  Pours a clear, ultra-golden yellow. The ""D"" engraved in the glass bottom produces a whirlwind of bubbles to the surface, of which is a gigantic, white, soapy-sudsy (with a creamy bottom) head. Glorious to look at. Smell is spicy Belgian yeast unleashed. Clove and fresh-cut grass, some lemony things.. complex smell. Taste is just as complex as everything else, and the smell is brought to life right up to your nostrils as the glass is raised to your face. The tulip is definitely doing its job. Besides a mellow, although spicy malt, there are green, floral hops that aren't as delicate as they seem at first. The feel is very carbonated, a bit hot (my only complaint), but smooth all the while. Finishes bitter and clovey, and very much dry. Drinks superb.  An outstanding beer that I would never drink in my home without that tulip glass - it really brings the tasting experience to a whole other level.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Smakawhat,3.23,"Poured from the bottle into a tulip/thistle glass. Best before July 2013 so she should be ready to roll.  A very thin bubbled totally white head of two finger size with some cake like retention. Real nice lemon gold clear body with much carbonation visible. The clarity on this beer is quite amazing has some very see through character to it. Head falls slowly and head bubbles all seem to be a nice pin head size. Good glow to this beer too and lots of sticky lacing as well.  Bouquet on the Duvel is a simple basic slight butter and yeast. Quite pleasant with a faint must. This is probably a good place to start, it's not too strong on the nose. Has a sweet creamy smell to some extent too, but also a sense of very clean.  Taste is predominantly fizzy... like club soda. Fresh club soda. I am getting... nothing else. Is this club soda beer? What's missing here? I feel like I am drinking Canada Dry or something with perhaps a little bit of hay/grass.  I can't rate this very high and probably not going to have it again for drinkability cause I know there are others in this style that I prefer by far.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

The balance on this beer is ridiculous! Stunningly balanced between the spices and malts. It's stunning how the high alcohol is completely disguised by this easy to drink beer. This beer is almost perfect in all aspects for a beer and for its style  M- Very smooth and sits delicately on the palate.  D- Incredibly high. I literally could drink gallons of this until I pass out.  Overall- What a great beer. Easily one of my top 20 to 25 beers I've ever had.

The nose is a sharp melding of spices, honey and citrus.  A breaded beer that has the slightest hint of alcohol. Honey is an to spices. Like butter on sourdough with a predominating lemon flavor matched by waning honey blended with a tinge of cloves. What it lacks in definitive, polarizing character, it makes up for as a mastering of subtlety.  Only complaint is the bubbles can be sometimes too tough.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Appearance: On first pour presented golden in color but became more cloudy as the yeast settled in the subsequent pours.  Smell: Strong yeast aroma resembling a sweet challah bread, with notes of tangerine.  Taste: yeasty initial taste that gave way to a slightly fruity middle and ended with a bitter after taste.  Mouthfeel: Initially was overcome by the amount of carbonation, but it settled into a buttery smooth finish and rest nicely on the palate.  Drinkability: it became easier to drink the more I had.

I think it adds a very nice spicy note to the fruity character  M: Light and highly carbonated due to the bottle conditioning.

222,695,TheBrewo,4.3,"We pour a brew of the mixed colors of straw and golden orange. There is a thick and frothy two finger head, white in color, that disappears at a medium speed. Finely patterned lacing is left as it departs. It never completely goes, leaving a pile of foam atop each of our glasses. There is a good deal of haze to the brew, with large chunks of yeast present. The carbonation is also quite active, with many bubbles sticking to the sides of the glass before they ascend. The aroma is of strong malts, with inclusions of faint esters, light and buttery diacetyls, orangey citrus, and a splash of earthen honey. We also detect clovey, medicinal phenols towards the back of the profile. As we sip, heavy malts up front are attacked by bitter yeast. This quickly drops to a middle that is sweeter, and lighter. This is due to the introduction of citrusy sweetness, as well as a flash of dried apricots and berries. The end, marked even more quickly than the middle, is indicated by a stark contrast of spicy clove, black pepper, and puckering yeast. There is also a heavy component of alcohol here, helping to mash all of the flavors together, bringing the taste to a concise finish. The aftertaste breathes with an elusive sweetness, along with some spice and obvious booze. The body is medium, with the biggest feature being the carbonation, which is huge. The mouth is slightly more dried than satiated, but is not unhappy. The abv is within range, and the beer drinks with ease and while it is apparent, the alcohol is not offensive to the taste buds.  Overall, what we found most enjoyable about this brew was its complexity. At first, when judging the aroma, it was difficult to get a handle on the flavoring within. Once it sat for a while, and we sipped, it really opened up. The flavoring, which was an interesting mix of bitterness and sweetness gave the drinker a good deal of contrast.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

S: Fresh and pleasant, but you can smell that this beer is strong, even though it's not the smell of alcohol.  T: Starts with citruses and bananas, then bread (and white pepper?) kicks in and pleasant bitter finish on palate. However lacks character. I've been expecting something more exciting. Unfortunately taste doesn't mask alcohol sufficiently.  M: Alcohol too intensive. Too much carbonation.  D: I'm about to finish the bottle, so I guess it's OK.

Wonderful balance of hops.  Mouthfeel: Not a trace of bitterness in the aftertaste. Wonderful mouthfeel.  Drinkability: This beer goes down way too easily.

222,695,Fatheranderson,4.85,"First off, thanks to the previous reviewer for saying that it smelled of sourdough, that was the word I was trying to think of for the past few minutes to describe the taste/smell (had massive writer's block).  Appearance: Cloudy golden yellow. Similar in appearance to a good heffeweizen.  Smell: Citrus, sourdough, a very clean smell that just fits the style like a glove.  Taste: Where to begin... there's just so much going on in each sip that it's hard to pick a beginning point. I guess what really hit me first was a sharp lemony taste that transitioned smoothly into a bready sourdough taste. Sharp hops are noticeable throughout with just a tiny almost hidden note of honey or brown sugar.  Mouthfeel: smooth, bubbly, refreshing.  Drinkability: The alcohol is so well hidden it ends up sneaking up on you. It's so delicious that you're drunk before you really realize it. That's both a good and a bad thing depending on whether or not you want to get smashed.  Food pairing: chili, porterhouse steak, seafood, good cheese.

There is four fingers of rocky white head that has insane retention, which I give as much credit to the glass itself as the beer.  S: Some great earthy and grassy yeast provide a base for some sweet malts and some of the best quality hops I've ever gotten a whiff of. Also, I get a faint hint of some banana and orange. Simplicity.  T: Strong grass and hop notes again, but maybe a little too strong for the tongue, where the nose could handle it. There's a little funk here that is accented by a hint of orange.

Some slight banana and spice notes going on, along with pears and perhaps some grassy hops.  T: The flavor is similarly sweet with lots of apples and pears with hints of banana and orange zest. Bread and a slight candi sugar note in terms of the malt character. Maybe a bit of skunk to go along with some grassy hops.

S: Definite a spicy Belgian scent here, with a slight hint of clove, banana and bubblegum. If you take a deep enough breath, you'll finally get the gentle boozy background that's just barely noticeable. Short breaths don't do this beer justice.  T: Great citrus, fruity and spicy yeast intial flavors, followed by an tinge of moderate bitter-sweet (apple-pear mixture) alcohol bite at the end. Oh so very impressed.  M: Creamy, but pretty bold carbonation that tingles and dances on the tongue. More carbonation for a Belgian beer, but in a good way. I think it makes the different flavors in this beer come through better.  D: I'm going to answer that easily in two words, ""Hell yeah"". You don't notice the higher ABV that is typically found in your Belgian style beers. This one seems lighter lighter and fresher to me, making it real easy to have a couple in a sitting. I would take my time savoring this one with each and every sip though. Great job Duvel, I think I'm going to pour myself another!!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

The beer pours a crisp golden, yellowish pale color, with a head that measures almost 2 inches and tries its hardest to run over the sides of the tulip glass. The stream of bubbles rising to the head is mesmerizing, like watching fish in a tank. The smell reminds me of candy, sweet delicious candy made of fine yeast and malts, its a very savory scent that grabs your nose and doesn't let go. The taste is incredible. Comes in sparkling and rough and leaves soft and sweet.

222,695,RossCain,4.31,"Poured from an 11.2 oz bottle into a Duvel Tulip... where do I begin?  A: Hands down one of the best looking beers when properly poured. Pours a gorgeous, opaque and hazy pale yellow with a billowing, rocky 3"" white head that makes for a beautiful presentation. Champagne like carbonation arises from the nucleation spot in the glass making for a steady head which slowly tapers off with a small cloud of fluff in the middle. The head continues to stick to the glass all the way throughout the beer. Very enticing  S: Upfront clean spiciness that accentuates the Duvel yeast and imparts light, typical ester notes of bananas and slight straw. Slightly peppery. A very lively but not overpowering aroma.  T: Spicy and yeasty upfront with a mildly bready taste mixed in. Moderate notes of orange peel and lemon zest shine through in the hop profile as the beer graces the palate. Finishes with the unique spicy nature of the Duvel yeast well melded with the hop profile.  M: Light and delicate bodied with excellent prickly carbonation making for a crisp and refreshing character in the beer. Well masked abv that is warming as in dances across the mouth. Dry and lightly bitter in the finish.  D: A superbly refreshing yet flavorful beer filled with subtle complexities an beautifully blended flavors. The spiciness is at just the right level to remain flavorful yet exceptionally drinkable throughout the experience. However, in higher quantities the beer the does seem to sit a little heavy in the stomach .  Overall, a very well crafted beer most deserving of the acclaim which follows the name. It certainly is the standard bearer of its style.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,portia99,4.48,"750ml corked & caged bottle poured into a Duvel tulip...long overdue reviewing this one.  A - Bottle opens with a very strong pop of carbonation. Pours a crystal clear pale,straw golden color with thick streams of carbonation rising thru the glass and a giant crown of fluffy white foam that lasts seemingly forever, falling slowly and leaving behind spiderwebs of lacing all over the sides of the glass. Beautiful looking beer.  S - Very hoppy up front (noble hops apparently) with some lemony citrus, spicy and a bit peppery, maybe a light hint of cloves. Very clean, almost pilsner like in aroma. Bready and yeasty base that is well integrated with the hops and well balanced. Overall, intense and dense with a variety of aromas.  T - Tastes much like the aroma would suggest. Crisply bitter with fruity flavors of lemons and apples. Spicy with some cloves and the distinct flavor of black pepper that meshes well with the hoppy bitterness. Sweet underpinning of malt that also contributes some grainy aspects and fresh bread and yeasty flavors too. Alcohol is only barely noticeable.  M - Medium bodied with a vivacious carbonation. Belgian spiciness and hop bitterness linger far into the aftertaste. Crisp and refreshing - carbonation seems to bring the flavor complexities out and gives a liveliness that enhances the refreshing qualities of the flavors too.  D - This marries the qualities of the best German pilsners and the unique spicy and yeasty aspects of Belgian ales. Crisp, clean bitterness and strong hop character combined with the fruity, estery Belgian yeast is a match made in heaven. Deserving of its reputation and scarily drinkable.

Outstanding presentation.  S - Nice and fruity with bananas, cloves, nutmeg and a touch of pineapple.  T - Very sweet and fruity with bananas and cloves dominating the flavours and the higher ABV is very nicely hidden. Touch of citrus flavours linger on the finish with a slight bitterness that remains. Top notch Belgian flavours with a nice balance between fruits and spices.  M - A medium bodied ale which fills the palette nicely, goes down smooth and provides you with a touch of alcohol heat.  D - Given the high ABV this stuff is delicious and incredibly drinkable.

Best Before: 05 2013  Glass that came with the set is defective(lopsided base, just like my last one), but I'll chance it just for the review.  Insane crown of stiff snow. Bubbly nucleation point checking in. Gold staw-colored, with just a twinge of haze. Sediment mostly stays in the bottle. Blobs of lace erratically stain the glass.  Smells of fresh mixed bitter greens & lemon upfront. With doughy yeast, crusty Italian bread, white peppercorns, sea salt & just a touch of malt sweetness bringing up the rear.  Taste upfront has a sweet, buttery chardonnay/doughy yeast combo(that doesn't come through as much if your hesitating friend only takes a small sip. So no hesitating!). Fantastic herbals & soft shallot-y onion sweetness. A little salt too. Finish is all crusty/doughy yeast, dry & eager to continue drinking.  Carbonation starts of strong, but dies off quickly. Body has a wheat-y feel. Alcohol isn't well hidden.  A classic, but in a blind tasting, I doubt I'd give this good of a score.

Covers the palate admirably and evenly.  Drinkability - Well... this beer is really good, however I didn't flip for it like some seem to. I am more than happy to drink it and it is very well made and very well balanced. Personally, I don't want to drink it continuously. I could have a few.

It's kind of spicy and it kind of smells like freshly cut apples. It's mellower than I thought it would be. I'm not really impressed with the taste either. It's ok but just ok. It slowly gets better the more sips you take. It's a standard Belgian pale. There's definitely worse beers out there but this doesn't impress me.

The initial appearance is fantastic, with a huge foamy head that lingers for several minutes, and beautiful copper orange that has a unique glow... it may be radioactive! The smell is an exceptional mix of yeast and grain of some sort, it just smells damn good! The first taste seems to tickle the tongue and invites you to really keep it in your mouth with a clean, crisp finish, you just keep wanting more! Perfect Belgium.

Pale yellow which is very clear (if it isn't, you didn't pour it right and got yeast in it) with a huge, rocky, beautiful head (from the Duvel logo to the top, if not you didn't pour it right). Head retention is superb. Bubbles only come from the center of the glass (if not, you didn't pour it right).  S: Some sweetness of malts, a hint of citrus and bit of spice.  T: Very malty with a little bit of sweetness to it. Some hop bitterness afterwards with associated spices.  M: Very full, perfect about of carbonation.  D: The worst aspect of a Duvel. It is a superb beer, but drinkability is limited. It is not the high alcohol, although that is noticeable, but it is rather the heavy feeling it leaves on your stomach. A few bars in Belgium have a challenge to drink a certain amount of Duvels (9+) in one evening without going to the toilet. If you are able to do that, you can drink for free the entire year. It is pretty much impossible to do because of the heaviness of Duvel on your stomach.  Conclusion: I love Duvel, I have been drinking it since I started going out. And every bar in Belgium carries this, so I've had a lot of Duvels already. It is THE example of the style.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Small alcohol note, but hidden.  The malt base gives off a very saltine like crispness. Hops bring out a nice citrus note that provides a very crisp and pleasant finish. For the style a bit more hops than expected. A small bit of funk, almost sourdough like. Intriguing to say the least.  So dang drinkable for 9.5%. Creamy texture is very, very quaffable.

Pretty classic appearance.  S: A somewhat subdued yeast characteristic for a Belgian, methinks. A bit of muted hops, too, it seems. Otherwise, a bit of wheat and maybe some must. Underwhelming.  T: Here too the yeast-forward flavor typical to Belgians is really soft. I suppose this accounts for the relative popularity of Duvel--it's not too challenging, but obviously pretty good. I don't get too much else from this--a whisper of bitterness, a pleasant but mild sweetness, well executed pale malt beer.  M: Really carbonated, even a bit much. Flits across the tongue, for sure--this would be great in the summer. Thin body otherwise, however--just a bit more oomph here and this would be epic. The booze is apparent, but not cloying.

It leaves behind a large amount of heavy gorgeous lacing that looks slightly like something my girlfriend would wear on my birthday.  S: over ripened orange and a malty quality that to me personally don't mix so well. Caramel apple finish off the barrage of smells that hit the nose. Don't get me wrong good smells but they really overly attack the nose in a way that's unbecoming.  T: the taste in no way resembles the nose. The smooth transition from light citrus in to pear and golden raisin like body. The bread mixed in from the malt give it a unique flavor with the pear and spice at the end.  MF: thick and creamy with a lot of effervescence and a nice astringent feel from the spiciness. The alcohol isn't noticeable really at all though if you really concentrate you can notice it try to linger in the after taste.  D: there's really no good reason to not buy this beer; (unless your not a fan of this style...

Excellent lacing along the glass, coats the glass almost entirely on its way down with solid carbonation. Mouthfeel is very good, making it a VERY drinkable beer.

The nucleation spot at the bottom of the glass makes a perfect stream of carbonation in the center of the glass. Great looking. This is also a great smelling beer. Belgian yeast, hops and sweet fruits dominate the nose.  The taste is great. The fruity (banana) sweetness really comes to the front here, tied along with some clove. Just a hint of sourness goes along with the hoppiness, balancing out the fruitiness and stopping it from being cloying. The mouthfeel is a bit light and a bit carbonated, it goes down very smoothly. The drinkability is also exceptional given the ABV. I wouldn't peg this at 8.5% alcohol if I didn't know it before hand.  Duvel has a great reputation, and with good reason.

Taste of wonderful wheat, rustic orange peel (no idea what the hell rustic has to do with oranges, it just pops into my mind), unmistakable and not-overpowering Belgian flavor. Enough said. Instant classic.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Daredevil,4.7,"very firm head, almost like yeast in an open brew tank .... nose: fresh grass, spring meadow after a heavy rain, pleasant but not entirely palatable ... taste: something like toasted bread with quince and granny smith apples on it ... sounds a bit weird, but the flavors are well embedded and very balanced one of the 10 brews to be delivered on my lonely island ...",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,butlerj,5,"If real Czech pilsner and good champaigne could mate ( possibly after a romantic evening of consuming large quantities of cloves and very dry mead), this would be their offspring. This beer has all of the flavor and nuance that American lagers claim to have. Imagine if a BMC beer was actually as good as their advertisements claim and you will get a pretty good idea what Duvel tastes like.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,afinepilsner,4.63,"11.2oz brown bottle 8.5% abv  Duvel was a hazy golden color. It had a large white head with impressive retention and lacing. The smell was fruit, yeast, hops, and a little pepper. The taste was excellent with a good mix of light malt, a little fruit, yeast and peppery spices. The finish was dry and lingering. It was medium-light in body and highly carbonated (in a good way). The drinkability was outstanding. This is a very good beer that is well worth seeking out.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,jeffthecheff,4.56,"Giving this beer another review. I wasn't impressed the first time I've had it a few years ago, but it has since become one of my favorite brews.  Poured into my brand new Duvel tulip, it is light yellow in color with good clarity. Head forms up very quickly, leaving a white froth on top for the whole glass. The carbonation bubbles are rapidly streaming from the ""D"" nucleation point.  Aroma is potent, with a ton of soft, pilsner malt character coming through. The yeast character is straight forward, with subtle spice and fruit notes. It isn't as characterful as many other pale Belgian styles, but it has a nice touch.  On the palate Duvel is light bodied and very highly carbonated. Flavor is delicate despite the high ABV. There is a light pale malt flavor, with a strong hop presence on the finish. Clean flavor overall, with only a slight, candy-like yeast presence adding depth. This beer is incredibly drinkable, and not just ""for the ABV."" This is a fast-sipper.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Zimbo,4.58,"Two things you need to know.  The Scottish connection. If it wasn't for a bottle conditioned McEwan's beer many decades ago, there would be no Duvel. As a little thank you for this I've long argued that Duvel should be free to all Scottish residents but unfortunately I've had no success as yet.  Secondly, when pouring always always ensure all of that fine sediment from the bottle goes into your glass. Always. Unlike almost all other bottle conditioned beers Duvel's sediment is there to be consumed and is paramount in appreciating this classic.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,gkunkle,4.72,"Pours a cloudy golden yellow color with a tall white fluffy head. As the head slowly recedes it leaves some very cool lacing on my glass. The beer is no as transparent as I expected. The smell is wonderful, it smells of sweet grain. The taste is of lemon-citrus, yeast with bits of hops and wheat. The 8.5% is hidden quite well. Mouthfeel is perfect, light, crisp and refreshing without being watery. Drinkability is great, but at 8.5% ABV, I don't think I'll let myself have more than one glass at a time.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,tburus,4.73,"Poured into a Duvel tulip. Nice!  Appearance: Foggy golden liquid with yeast swirling inside. Thick, bubbly head. Rapid stream of carbonation rising from center of the glass.  Smell: Nice intermingling of apple and hops/pine.  Taste: Enters tasting like a muted apple cider. This taste subsides in favor of the slight bitterness of hops.  Mouthfeel: Yeasty/wheaty flavor cover the palate. Subtle aftereffects of apple. Mild sour taste leftover, again reminiscent of cider. Slightly more carbonation than I desire.  Drinkability: It's gone already?!? Honestly, one of the best, easiest drinking beers I have tried to date. The price is the only thing that would keep me from drinking this several times a week.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,wvsabbath,4.4,"Serving Type - Bottle  Appearance - Very carbinated, yellowish golden tan. Insane 4 inch white head, tons of lacing, beautiful.  Smell - Very belgium yeast tones. Floral hops, spices, grapes, mellon, light traces of alcohol. Has that pale ale malt smell, inpressed so far.  Taste - Very bold, tons of flavors. Floral hops, alcohol and yeast mixed with the spices, wow. Its much like a champagne with its rich complex and carbinated drink. The pale ale malts add to it, but doesnt sour or bitter it up any. Huge fruit flavors, grape and mellon really come out. This is impressive.  Mouthfeel - Very thick and bold on mouth. Tounge gets a workout with all the complex flavors, and palette gets warm and bitter as you swallow this beer down. Aftertaste is slighly dry and bitter.  Drinkabilty - Its too complex and strong to drink anymore then 2 really. Its a sipper to savior and enjoy. I wouldnt drink this weekly since you would become spoiled and possibly broke.

222,695,Internatbrewlove,4.89,"This brew has a translucent honey-amber color and a wonderful bouquet with hints of yeast and citrus overtones. This beer is very effervescent and has a large white head that very slowly fades to a thin frothy film. On tasting there is a pleasant, fine tingling that lingers on your tongue. There is a slight sweetness at the onset and firm but, subtle hoppiness to give a prolonged finish.  This is another beer that you will not tire of with frequent consumption. This is one of my all time favorite beers!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,knowledge,4.27,"Incredible beer. Very hoppy and beautiful. The rich head has to be tamed and must use precaution when poured. I received mine in a gift box with a tulip glass.

Enjoy!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,paxkey,5,as always a perfect beverage. pours honey marmalade gold and gives head like a world class champion. the head on this beer symbolizes all that makes it great. its a living monument to the wonderful duvel yeast. rocky cloudy and stiffens at the top. it smells divine. a magical blend of spices malt and yeast. dry sweet complex tasting. leaves a whirlwind of flavors on the palate during and long after each delightful sip. sniffing this beer alone puts it heads and shoulders above the average fare. and it tastes so good you cant wait for the next sip while trying to savour the one you just had. no alcohol taste whatsoever but a hearty warming from the high ABV is inevitable. this is the good stuff.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,bubseymour,3.76,"For all of the A+ and A ratings this one seemed a little overhyped to me after my tasting. The head and continuous carbonation truly was amazing. Almost too amazing as I poured slowly into a tilted pint glass, but had to wait after 6 oz poured as the head was already 3 to 4 fingers thick and near the top of the glass. The appearance was slightly murky somewhere between a pilsner and a wheat. The flavor was good, not great, and the high alcohol content was well disguised. For the high price tag, I was expecting a little more spectacular beer, but its still a decent beer worth a sampling. It is very drinkable and if I weren't such a lightweight, I could probably have a 2nd or 3rd..however 1 is enough for me to feel it.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Soonami,4.41,"Duvel is just a wow beer. I've had it once or twice, but hardly ever seek it out or try it when out because it's nearly ubiquitous at any good beer bar or shop. There is really no reason not to drink Duvel more often if one does not. The pour on this beer is perfect! The beer is a bright sunshine yellow with goldenrod highlights and is capped by billowy, finely held-together pearly white head that sticks and stays forever. Duvel has a nice fruity aroma with notes of spicy yeast and toasted malt. The beer has good flavors of apples skin, juicy asian pear, a little pepper spice and a nicely dry finish. The beer is highly carbonated and does a light spritzy dance on your tongue. Very easy to drink and the 8.5% percent alcohol is well hidden and with just a little warming in the throat but no burning taste.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

S - Lemon, green apple, yeast and hop floral.  T - Yeasty biscut, lemon and apples, with spice, pepper and some alcohol. Finishes lightl sour and mildly bitter. I liked the Ommegang Abbey a little better but this is quite fine.  M - Light body, heavy carbonation. Very effervescent; a bit too much for my preference.

Huge foamy head that lasted forever, even with a careful pour so as not to disturb any sediment. Golden in color and very slightly hazy. Plenty of carbonation bubbles rising. Lots of thick lacing.  Powerfully pungent aroma even at the beginning of the glass. Strong smell of yeast, with a funky aroma that I'm trying to put my finger on... bubble gum. Mixed with the yeast I think it's quite funky. Slight alcohol smell too.  Tasted fantastic! Great balance between hops, malts, yeast, spices, light sweet fruits like apricots, pears and apples, very reminiscent of the saison I had earlier actually.  Feels absolutely delightful. Rich and smooth, tangy from the ample carbonation, lovely light bitterness that lingers on.  Drinks great too. I could easily drink this beer every week and never get tired of it.

Quick tips on how to pour the beer (unhurriedly) as well as ""Bottle Conditioned"" on the label.

Appearance: huge foamy chunky head 3 to 4 fingers like an icecream float. the lace clings to the glass in patchy clumps. slight cloudy yeasty golden hue. chunks of foamy head clinging to the glass all the way down. the head will outlast the brew itself with some foam left in the bottom of the glass.  Smell: smells like warm piss, yeast bite in the aroma.  Taste & Mouthfeel: Very dry, no maltyness at all to me. champange like bubbly texture, yeast, hop bitterness and alcohol very prominent. very crisp.

222,695,cameraman,4.5,"A pale golden color is poured in the glass. A strong white colored head, that is two fngers thick and hangs on to the sides of the glass. A yeasty fragrance strikes the nose, followed by a mild funky scent, but not off putting. It finishes with a light to medium grassy scent. A bread and cracked grain flavor comes through at the front of each taste. Then it blends to a yeasty twang, then moving to a grassy and earthy bitterness. A watery feel, with cleansing sensation of carbonation, it then finishes with a strong dryness that seems last forever on the palate. Another beer that is the standard for its style and does not disappoint. A classic with its golden color, the yeasty flavor, and dry feel, makes one crave some mussels and frites.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,tubacharlie,5,"Poured unhurriedly, as the label suggests, yields a crystal clear ale of a light straw-gold color with a rocky white head of large and medium bubbles. Slowly receding and leveling out to a thick carpet of foam, the bubbles coalesce into a smoother surface with nice lacing stuck to the sides of the tulip glass.  The palpable yeast presence emits a light, peppery aroma with intriguing floral notes, especially after swirling around the dregs in the bottle and pouring down the center to cloud up the contents. A hint of clean alcohol esters is also discerned.  First sips reward the tongue with grassy, spritzy grain and cereal flavors accented with dry biscuit and slightly astringent hints of sweet citrus and green apple. Smooth and nicely balanced, the devilishly high alcohol content is hardly noticeable. Well carbonated and effervescent, the brew enjoys its brief party in the mouth before a wet hop sendoff, leaving a hint of bright bitterness in the good-bye, enticing one to yearn for another visit.  A classic that never goes out of style, it pairs nicely with some Gorgonzola spread on freshly toasted baguettes. Some smoked salmon on the side is gracefully engaged and complements the combination, for a petite feast of grandeur.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Sour finish, lemon or apple-ish.  M- Carbonation is spot on. Mouthwatering. Dry finish.  D/O- A true celebratory beer (review #100!), Duvel needs to be respected.

Hops upfront but also tasting, lemon zest, grass, banana, sweet malts, and other subtleties as well - there's alot going on, but in a really positive way. It tastes very clean, crisp, and dry with a good dose of carbonation - real nice mouthfeel. I also dont detect any of the alcohol in this BSPA.

Streaky clingy lacing on the sides of the glass as I drink this beer down.  S- Interesting aroma. Some light bubblegum notes in this. Saison like with some light barnyard funk. Tripel like with the Belgium yeasty-ness and candi sugar like aroma. Some light banana with a hint of clove. Hops were not really there but lightly bitter in the background.  T- Nice sweet malt like front with a interesting funky taste. Middle has a light bitterness from the hops with tones of banana and cloves. Light bubblegum notes with a hint of sour apple on the backend. Alcohol burn in the very end which warms the stomach.  M- Light-medium mouthfeel. Carbonation is good for the style. Light yeasty notes with clove left on the palate. Bitter hops and light alcohol left in the aftertaste. Medium drying on the palate. Flavors were well blended and had light standout notes here and there. Clean tasting overall with crisp notes.  D- This beer is good. I always forget about this with the insane amount of craft beer out there. The ABV is pretty well hidden until the ending.

222,695,drizzam,4.73,"A - As soon as I cracked the bottle open, the brew started to gush from the bottle. Did I get an overcarbonated one? I poured it into a clear pint glass and ended up with a clear and very pale yellow body, topped by an enormous fluffy white head. Beautiful lacing left on the insides of my glass. This beer looks phenomenal!  S - It took me a while to get through the enormous fluffy head so I could smell this brew, but once I did, I smelled aromas of sweet citrus, spicy pepper and some nice earthy hoppiness.  T & M - The head was so ridiculous that it felt like it took an hour before I could taste it! The citrus I smelled in the aroma was there, but it almost took a back seat to the pepper and the earthy hop bitterness. Actually, it compliments the spice quite nicely. Medium bodied with a bit of coarse tingle from the carbonation. The alcohol is VERY well hidden, a genuine task for the 8.5% ABV.  D - This is a delicious brew and I'm a bit upset with myself that it took me this long to try it. If it weren't so expensive, it would be a daily stock item in my frig.

Appearance 5/5 The looks of this beer cannot be put into words and it's an experience in itself to achieve the perfect pour that showcases the brilliance of Duvel. Brightly clear and golden with massive sudsy head that takes a while to come down to a manageable level, which is still very dense and rocky and is getting fed continuously by the stream of bubbles rising from the bottom of the tulip. The lacing is similar to head: chunky, dense and sticky.  Aroma 4/5 Light phenols and fruit (pear, apricot) dominate the nose, with hints of soft alcohol creeping in with warmth. Little sweetness from the malts, hints of toast, and some dark fruit are also present.  Taste 4/5 Opens with slight fruitiness, but quickly displays the hop bitterness and its rich malty, vinous, and soft alcohol character. The finish, however, is amazingly dry and long with dry bitterness of dark fruit, and hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel 5/5 Effervescent with medium body.  Drinkability 5/5 Recipe for disaster!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,arboristfish,4.92,"After pouring the beer into the glass, the color of the beer is what you would expect from a lager. The head is very fizzy, and lasted through most of the beer. The carbonation is fizzy, but doesnt overly burn the mouth. It is a sweet beer, but is balanced very well, with a nice noble? hop spiciness. The mouthfeel is light. At 8.5% this beer is very drinkable!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,biegaman,4.26,"Surely this brilliantly clear, incredibly fair and glossy yellow beverage has been mislabeled. The Devil? This? But it's so sunny and pristine and, with the massive white cloud atop it, almost angelic looking. That head, for which this beer (and Belgian beer in general) is renown, is truly epic in size and sheds in big clumps along the sides of the glass.  Dynamic yeast and bready malts greet you with a tight, warming embrace as if they were your parents before seeing you go off to war. Children commonly use stuffed animals or blankets as objects of comfort - beer drinkers have Duvel. Passionately phenolic yeast, a confident maltiness and some sneaky hops combine for something ambrosial.  Mirroring their performance in the smell, savory notes of dried herbs, warm white bread crusts, vine-ripe hops, dollops of apple and pear puree and a dash of something zesty are the flavour precedent of the Belgian Strong Golden Ale style and the yardstick against which all others continue to be measured. This intricate blend of fruity esters, spicy phenols, gritty hops and pale malts is the touchstone of stability and harmony in beer.  Duvel is curiously light-bodied for a beer that is reportedly so strong; you'd never guess close to the 8.5% that the label lists. The beer is clean and quenching as a Pilsner, but with the added complexities of a finely-tuned Belgian yeast. Those zestful phenols and a strongly carbonated effervescence are what steer that wheel, with soft water, earthy bitterness and the sweetness from the added sugars accompanying in the backseat.  Every genre of music and film have their all-time classics, the mainstay and must-haves for any collector, the benchmarks upon which so many others have been either inspired or emulated. For Belgian beer, Duvel is certainly just that. It is at once light and refreshing yet bold and complex, simple but elaborate, a beer so suited to quick, mindless quaffing precisely because it is so mindful of balance and proportion. A true magnum opus.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

This beer is full of carbonation that adds a certain bite with spice, yeast and sweet grains. smells like yeast and grains. The sweet dry aftertaste lingers for quite some time, and the smooth taste makes this beer very drinkable. the carbonation definitely adds a nice prickle to your tongue and overall this beer is great! definitely resembles val dieu and is something that i will definitely buy again! good stuff! its weird this is one beer that just says, ""enjoy me because im great"" and i listened. wow nice! cheers",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

The head is taking forever to fade, first sip yeilds some foamy head while the beer itself is quite smooth. Light on the palatte, tastes almost sweet. This certainly tastes alot better than it smells (basically your typical pale ale). No lingering aftertaste, finishes quick and refreshing. Drinkability is pretty high, this is easy to tip back.

And I keep nodding and telling myself that it probably is. In the big world of Beer fandom...it's really not a unique beer to have as your numero uno, but if you're at a bar, or you're anywhere where you're surrounded by Bud Light drinking fratboys, and you pop this bad boy open....you instantly become king of that domain; no matter where you are. Duvel is, in my slightly noobish state of being a beer advocate, the number one beer on the planet.  This is the first part of my review, and basically just the brief opening I have planned for it. I'll continue to edit this review until a full, and rather lengthy review is completed. Do you care? Of course the fuck not. Why? Because Duvel is awesome.

It looks absolutely amazing, with its great color and huge white head. The taste was just plain delicious. Not very bitter, with incredible flavors.

S- Very malty for such a light looking beer. Nice heavy smell of hops at the front that finishes with a heavy dose of fresh smelling earthiness and a hint of yeast.  T- Heavy taste of malts throught the drink. Also very bitter on the tongue from the first taste to the aftertaste. Beer has a heavy effervescence which is a nice compliment to the bitterness. The malts and yeast also have a heavy hand in this beer, creating a very rounded out flavour.  D- Quite unique beer. Too much carbonation for my liking, but I can see how it adds to the drink.

222,695,nataku00,4.03,"I've had Duvel in the past, but never reviewed it. Since I just bought a Duvel gift pack for a new glass to replace the one I've broken, I have more Duvel to drink. Poured gently from an 330 ml bottle into a Duvel tulip glass, leaving most of the yeast in the bottle. Slightly hazy yellow beer with an initial two fingers of snow white fluffy head. Laces nicely as the head dissipates slightly to just over a finger's worth, with the center of the head retaining a little bit of a peak. Plenty of carbonation streaming off the bottom of the glass keeps the head in place.  Nose is light pale malts that lends to a pleasant sweetness, with a bit of hops to balance it. Fairly strong aroma, aided by the large head. Not overly complex, though.  Taking a sip, the pale malts and hops are present at the tip of the tongue, but the alcohol content helps deliver a nice floral component to the flavor profile. Light biscuity sweetness stays on the tongue after swallowing.  Beer is light bodied, but the small bubbled but active carbonation makes it decently creamy in the mouth. Aftertaste is pleasant and not overpowering. A nice standby to drink that widely available now.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Tasted like the nose but with the added complexity of what I would guess is a taste similar to allspice. After it warmed up a tad, I could taste something similar to a white wine. Not that there was a grape taste, but more like a sweet German wine Yes, they use grapes, but grapes weren't the overwhelming taste.

Smell is of sweet lemon grass, some bread-like malts, and spicy Belgian yeast. Having never had Duvel before, the smell definitely made me want to take a first sip.  The taste backed up the smell. Sweet, citrus fruits and spicy Belgian yeast. For such a highly rated beer, I was honestly a bit disappointed in the taste. Don't get me wrong, it was good, it just wasn't something that really stood out to me.  Mouth feel was light and dry. Carbonation was above average. Drinkability was high despite the high ABV.

Head evaporates sporadically, eventually leaving a crown and bits of lacing. Lots of visible carbonation in the glass.  Smell is slightly grassy, with a light lemon flavor.  Taste is similar to the nose, though the grassy portion is more subdued (thankfully). Some slight honey like sweetness. Some very light spice that I almost didn't notice. No real alcohol taste. Slight sweet aftertaste.  Both the smell and taste kinda reminded me of a pilsner, but a really good pilsner (and apparently much more boozy). Very easy to drink, especially at the ABV value. Not quite for drinking when you are cutting the grass, but definitely something for the patio or casual drinking.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,BuckyFresh,4.41,"Appearance: Poured from an 11.2oz bottle into a large wine glass. Pours a straw yellow, with a pillowing two-finger head. Head retention is amazing and evolves into what looks like the surface of the moon (porous appearance, with craters and mounds, etc...) Lacing is also superb. Quite a bit of carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass.  Smell: What a refreshing aroma. I'm getting some lemon/citrus scents, grassy notes, and some sour yeast. There is also an underlying fruity sweetness that invites the drinker to partake.  Taste: The flavor is pretty biting and intense for how light and unassuming this one looks. A nice mix of malty sweetness and a dry/sour spicy yeast punch to the tongue. Also, the 8.5 percent ABV is hidden better than almost any other beer with a similar alcohol content. A tart, citrusy, refreshing summer beer with a dry, clean finish. Delicious!  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, tart, tons of flavor and punch, and a dry, clean finish.  Drinkability: You could get yourself in trouble with a few of these. It's so refreshing and hides the ABV so well, you could pound a few before the alcohol caught up to you!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Lots of head formation as well and a huge amount of lacing. Impressive.  Smell: I get some fruity smells with a lot of yeast spiciness. There's also some hops but not all that much. A little bit of alcohol is also present.  Taste: surprisingly, it hides the alcohol well until the beer is room temperature (in my opinion). The taste follows the nose and has fruit, a lot of sweetness, and yeast spiciness. As it warms, the beer becomes a little more complex and the alcohol becomes more present.  Feel: light in body, not much alcohol bite, not much bitterness. Lots of carbonation so its very crisp.  Drink: very high. I'm surprised people don't drink this when trying to get sloshed instead of BMC.  Overall, I can see why this is the benchmark for the style.

The top surface of my beer was never visible because there was a thick white foam over it throughout the drinking session.  S - Aroma is unique. There is a crisp graininess, maybe from Pilsner malt, combined with a spice note (coriander?). Overlaid on that are wine-like and green apple notes. This almost smells more like champagne than beer.  T - The taste is subtle and matches the aromas very well. It has the same mix of light Pilsner malt, a hint of peppery spices and some champagne-like wine notes. The alcohol is evident, but you can't tell it is 8.5%. The finish is very dry.  M - The body is amazingly light and the fluffy carbonation lightens it even more.

Savor it, don't slurp it. If you don't appreciate it, don't drink it and there'll be more for me!  I don't understand why this beer isn't more readily available in the United States.

222,695,angusdegraosta,4.45,"It's hard to not give credit where credit is due on this one. Every aspect of this beer works exceptionally well to produce an impressive drinking experience. You pay for it: Duvel will never be as cheap as a Bud, but what you get is quite worth it.  Some things that stand out: plenty of carbonation, which leads to a kick when the flavor sets in. How do they achieve this taste? I've tasted aromatic spiciness in a beer before, but never so well integrated. This not a beer with any sort of typical hoppy bitterness. You can't call it too bitter. You can't even call it sweet (well, maybe a little). Powerful is what comes to mind. I think the high alcohol content helps achieve the balance.  The kinds of words needed to describe this brew require a wine connoisseur. I love wine as well, and maybe the best way to describe Duvel is something akin to a carbonated wine made with grains and hops instead of grapes.

222,695,mellowmark,4.83,"Poured from an 11.2 oz. stubby brown bottle to an Oversized Wine glass ""unhurriedly"" according to brewers recommendation on the back label. Best before date of November 2012. $13.49 for a 4-pack.  Appearance: Enormous 4-finger fluffy rocky white head fills half the glass and sticks around to the end. Lacing clings in clumpy patches. With this pour I decided to leave out the yeast. The color is an off gold (pale of course) and completely transparent. I would recommend to leave out the yeast if you want that crystal clear consistency. The sediment I've found will also muddle the flavors and change the mouthfeel. Of course it's up to you, just drinker beware.  Smell: Smells of Belgian yeast and apple skin. A little bit of alcohol but not as present as the 8.5 ABV would suggest. The pleasant yeast funk is the dominating factor in the nose and has you constantly coming back for more.  Taste: I've seen some people complain about the head being too big to drink, but that just shows they probably weren't using the correct glassware, didn't pour correctly, and don't understand this was the intention of the brewer. The large head brings out the aromas and adds a nice creaminess to each sip. Towards the end it should be well settled if it was poured correctly to begin with. Taste is spicy with some sweetness at the beginning. The hop bitterness comes through towards the end. Bready notes from the yeast with some citrus.  Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel is medium and smooth even with the high carbonation. Bone dry on the palate yet juicy at the same time. Nice warming effect.

The hop aroma is pleasant for what is to come. The yeast that comes through shows the true Belgian influences.  T/M: The front is smooth, spiciness that holds into the body of the beer. The body shows notes of clove and banana, while expressing bold yeast notes. The lively carbonation is full of flavor and brings a high sensory experience.  There is a very smooth transition from the full effect of the body to the lingering taste. Nice and slow, very constant in the complexities. The off taste is a watery, refreshing and funky sensation from the yeast.  D: I see this as a very drinkable beer, the flavors are very good and the ABV is hard to detect.

S-Biscuity malt, a great Belgian yeast zing and a hint of sweetness mixed with banana and some black pepper.  T-Delicious banana and clove notes mixed with bready malt and a great Belgian yeastiness.  M-Light to medium bodied, crisp, highly carbonated.  D-A dangerously drinkable beer. No indication that this is 8.5% ABV.  The classic example of the style.  HV",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

The classic Belgian esters and very subtle in the nose also. The flavor is very herbal, floral and citrusy upfront with some light fresh bread and soft banana/clove esters rounding out the middle. The finish is lightly yeasty with just a touch of sweet candi sugar to balance it all.

T - Starts sweet with residual sugar. Moves to a juicy orange and lemon flavor. Finishes a little sweet with an aftertaste of tart fruit and faint hops.  M/D - Medium body, with a semi-sweet finish, great carbonation. Wonderful flavor and a simply complex flavor profile, haha.

222,695,crnipeter,3.08,"I dunno why it took me so long to review this beer as it's so widely available and I've had many. 330 ml, BBE June 2012, into Duvel tulip. Pours spectacular, rocky white head that gradually subsides, becoming dimply and broken into clumps and patches. Although the brewer claims only original ingredients have been used in this one, the artificially looking head gives an impression of clumps of foam floating on a heavily polluted river rather than clouds drifting over the golden sea below. Aromas of pale malts, fruity esters of apple tartness and pear,some candied sugar, quite noticeable alcohol. Flavors of green apple tartness and pear rolled into soft pale malts, slightly peppery with warming alcohol notes. Tons of carbonation and bitterness derived from Styrian Golding hops lend dry finish with bitter aftertaste. Light to medium body seems lighter due to effervescent texture and crispiness. One might say that Duvel is a style of its own, but in terms of Belgian golden strong ale it does a poor job. Fruity esters are somehow indecisive and lacking any citrus notes, spicy and peppery phenolic to subdued (at least in the aroma section). Duvel was created as a response to the growing popularity of Czech pilsners and their German counterparts that ravished across Europe at the time. And this is what it is - although basicaly an ale, Duvel is merely a pilsner clone on steroids.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

With a supremely violent *POP* I am met by a divinely skunky poof of marijuana. Mellow clove and yeast beneath but honestly there is no honest way to describe this without invoking good old Mary Jane in the membrane. Not to mention this is perhaps the most beatific head I have ever seen on a beer. Settles into mountainous formations worthy of a shrink-rayed helicopter drop w/ snowboard. How in the fuck do they do this?? Heaven.  Spacious lemon-limes adorn an absolutely extraordinary blend of fresh band-aid and pilsener style hops (grassy cows and all). Does that entirely describe this beer? Yup. Is that a bad thing? Not to me!  Got to love the cloudy mouthfeel of this beer, so much that an entire bomber is hardly excess. Pretty amazing to say the least.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Pale sweet malts, some and hay, yeasty phenols, grass, honeydew melon, and slightly unripened apples (not green).  On the taste the pale malt upfront with an herbal/grassy and soft fruit middle (touch of lemon citrus acidity) leading to a dry bready finish; very tongue prickling in a good way. The finish is the standout for me as the crisp, peppery like bitterness matches the malt perfectly. Additionally the high carbonation refreshes the palate and made my mouth water for another sip. Alcohol is masked so well that the only reason you know its relatively high in alcohol is by how fast you can catch a buzz; it truly is a devilishly top notch brew.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,DKMonroe,4.46,"Embarrassingly enough I've had a Duvel tulip for a while and never tried the brew it was intended for, and when I tasted it it was totally different than any conception I've had since I had the glass. Went to the beer/liquor store in TN (weird separated law) and got the big bottle.  I popped the cork and the head came out slightly and made a small mess. The brew was exited to get out for sure. On the pour it had a massive head even with a gentle pour. Thats one impressive head I must say.  The smell was good, citrus, banana.. and a slight hint of the ABV but not too bad.  The taste was good as well, just light, and a little like the smell with the citrus, and banana. I didn't detect much of the alcohol content, and was totally expecting to. Was surprised for sure. I think this could be a dangerous brew ;0)  Loved drinking it.. and will definatley not go as long again without it.  Heh, if it wasn't for the glass i probably would not have tried it..",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,cnally,4.05,"Poured into a tulip for maximum experience.  A crisp golden yellow color in the body, many carbonation bubbles abound. A frothy impressive white head remains sticky.  Aroma is a little sour, grainy but has a crispness to it that brings it through.  The flavor is admittedly complex. Initially bitter, a nice lightly toasted malt rises up after that. Grainy and borderline corn flavor is dominant but the finish is a mild hop bitterness.  Bubbly, heavy, creamy mouthfeel on this one, probably the beer's finest quality.  Repuation is a funny thing. It seems to be derived from heightened expectation leveraging against the actual product in question. I believe this beer is just that, one that relies on you thinking it is one of the finest beers in the world, and if you believe it just enough, you will elevate the status of this beer from merely good to great.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,jampics2,4.48,"330ml bottle into the Dennis Meyers Duvel glass. Holy smokes, this is a great looking beer! Gold with orange touches, a huge three finger rocky head, and perhaps the best lace ever. I've enjoyed Duvel for a while now, but finally have a glass worth reviewing it in!  Smells of Pilsen malt, some earthy noble hops and touches of citrus, and yeasty esters. Some orange, apple skin, and a bit of booze. Wow, this is indeed how it should be done.  Taste Follows the nose. There's a nice Pilsen malt base that provides ample sweetness and cracker flavors. The yeast gives slight banana and lemon touches with a touch of pepper, while the hops provide earthy and orange impressions. There is a bit too much booze for me (minor complaint), otherwise, this has everything a BSPA should have.  The appearance and mouthfeel are certainly the highlights here. The beer is soft and crisp at the same time. Light and airy, it's got just a touch too much booze in the finish to be considered perfect. But very, very good feel, perhaps the Moortgat family did make a deal with the devil to have a beer this refreshing not feel too watery. Overall, this is certainly a benchmark setting beer, certainly deserving of top ratings and acclaim. I do feel like I've had some beers that have been a bit more targeted towards my palate and personal preferences. But this is the legend, the Rolling Stones or even Robert Johnston of the Belgian beer scene. One thing is for sure. If this beer leaves you singing the blues, maybe it's time to be a wine drinker.

222,695,shodrod,4.08,"This is one of my favorite summer beers. It pours a gorgeous, light, hazy golden color with a head that hangs to the side of the glass. The aroma is generally a 'yeasty' kind of sour smell. The flavor delivers what you expect from the smell: a lovely sourness with hints of apple and pear.

The alcohol is less than apparent, with a yeasty almost skunked - bad batch? - nose. Taste is sweet at the start, a bit more bitter towards the back, overall pleasant. Still, there wasn't anything about this beer that really hooked; it's good across the board, but great in few. At least by my taste.  Looking for a clean drinking Belgian Pale with some octane? Go for it. Just keep your expectations reasonable.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,mariposafan,4.26,"I was preparred to be less than impressed with this beer. Wrong again!  Bottle poured into a Duvel tulip. It poured a hazy light golden color with an amazingly fluffy head that stayed and stayed. Nice lacing on the glass showing a timeline of the entire drink.  The smell was citrusy with some banana - it reminded me of a hefeweizen almost but with an underlying maltiness. There was also something a little sharp about the smell that had me worried that there'd be too much bitterness in the taste.  Not to worry. The taste was just fine. There was a sharpness there but it wasn't tongue clenching bitterness so much as a citrus bite. Malty, fruity, altogether enjoyable.  The mouthfeel was a little thinner than I'd hoped for with this much flavor but still very nice. The carbonation that produces that amazing head kept it nicely tingly without feeling like a soda.  This isn't the sort of thing I'd even consider drinking multiples of at one sitting but for what it is it's very drinkable.

222,695,BeerNinja007,4.18,"I finally got my hands on a bottle of Delerium Tremens and tried it last night, really enjoyed it. Then I noticed that Duvel is king of the BSPA category, a full 10 spots above DT. Duvel? Really, Duvel??? The stuff I see at the grocery store all the time and have always discounted because it's so widespread? Sheesh, how long have I been walking right past this stuff and not given it due respect?! Right under my nose this whole time??! OH THE INJUSTICE, HOW IT HURTS!!  So I drove down this evening to the grocery store at the bottom of the hill and picked up a 750mL bottle for $9.99. Best before Nov.19.2012. Remove the crown, twist, POP, into my favorite tulip it goes.  First pour, although less than moderately rigorous, gives a giant frothy 4"" of white head atop a tiny 1"" of effervescent mostly-clear pale yellow brew. I carefully feed it a little more and the foam rises a full 1"" above the lip of the glass without falling. This is going to take a while.  At first the smell is big skunk. Crap. Maybe I should have pulled a bottle from the back of the open-faced beer cooler (this one was front and center, and I doubt this gets much circulation). But the skunk gradually fades a bit and a mix of other things starts to emerge.  On the tongue the robust carbonation is very bright but not harsh. Feel is moderately thin, not much body, so it's the carbo that is keeping it from being watery. Taste is a bit sour with overly-ripe lemon rind, significant (but not over-powering) skunk, mellow rounded cinnamon and clove spices enhanced by a bit of alcohol.  Overall I'm seriously underwhelmed, especially given all the anticipation. I strongly suspect that this is a semi-bad bottle, especially because 10 minutes after finishing it the skunk is still lingering on my palate. Certainly will get another from a different source and update this review if warranted. :/  ---  Update 27th October 2010:  Got another bottle from a different store (and pulled it from the back of the shelf where it was out of the light). Best by 14/02/13. Appearance and feel are the same. A little skunk in the nose and taste but not as much as I remember from last time and it fades almost completely. This is totally different from last time. The sourness is gone, it's a much nicer rounded Belgian Pale Ale... light honey, warm cinnamon and clove, a little citrus hop. Similar to before in substance, but overall much nicer this time around. Changed as follows. Smell: 3.0 to 4.0, Taste: 3.0 to 4.5, Drink: 3.5 to 4.0.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,ThePorterSorter,4.33,"Poured properly into a Duvel tulip. You'd assume either i'm the man to have a Duvel glass, or this is one of the 4 Duvels that came with the glass in the gift-pack...(the latter).  Appearance: Given that the pour looks identical to what is considered ""correct,"" including a towering head from the Duval logo up to the brim and a golden, relatively clear brew beneath, I'd say this is a beautiful beer. There is ample lacing and the head remains intact through most of the drink. An improper pour (from experience) has made an iceberg head phenomenon (?). The beer looks lively and very well carbonated. Plumes of bubbles rise from the stem where the Duval ""D"" is engraved.  Smell: The smell is that of a good Belgian ale. I actually performed a nasal rinse in preparation for this beer (no lies). There is well placed spice, notes of citrusy hops and a typical sour Belgian funk. I can almost smell a whiff of lavender that's relaxing enough to permit falling into a deep sleep.  Taste: So good. It tastes like liquid gold Belgian ale. My favorite part about this beer, which is why I give it such acclaims. It tastes floral, rich, yeasty, smooth, sweet mixed with a sour/bitter aftertaste. Which is how flavors should transition down the tongue. With the abv at a staggering 8.5% I am almost reminded of weak chardonnay. I could see this pairing with both good friends and good foods.  Mouthfeel: Bubbly, thanks to to the bottle conditioning and double fermentation at the brewery, as well as refreshing. For a golden ale this is more dense than usual, but still a bit watery for my liking. Hiving experience in brewing my own pilsner, this beer possesses deep complexity and the mouth approves.  Drinkability: Definitely drinkable year round and may become a new bar favorite. Pace yourself because this is almost too easy to drink. I would have another for sure, I'm super satisfied with the purchase.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,JohnQVegas,5,"750ml bottle into Bruery tulip. This is one of those iconic beers that it's almost impossible to believe that I haven't reviewed yet, much like Arrogant Bastard was not too long ago. Nice to finally sit down and make this one official.  Pours a quite-hazy pale straw, with a dense, rocky white head that towers above the rim of the glass as the beer is being poured. Once this one finally settles down to about 2 fingers, there are massive honeycomb-sheets of lacing, and the the bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass leave the sides of the head look like tiny, intricately stacked spheres that get progressively smaller from top to bottom. Stunning beer.  Nose is replete with a huge array of aromas - honey and white pepper, pears, just a bit of apple skin, just a bit of fresh-cut hay. What's amazing about this one is the clarity of each of these aromas - there's no sifting around through a set of muddled-together scents wafting about, these are beautifully clear and precise and distinct. A beautiful example of why yeast can be more important than any other ingredient in a beer.  Taste is world class as well. Lighter than the nose, starts off dry, white pepper and a bit of tangy yeast coming through, with the apples and pears coming through close behind. No honey sweetness here anywhere to be found, though a nice grassiness comes through in our first real glimpse of the hops. The finish carries a bit more pepper, light sourdough, bit of grassiness, and a kiss of lemon. Alcohol is barely there at all, only showing up just enough to add another wee layer of complexity. Absolutely beautiful beer.  Mouthfeel, not to be outdone by the other aspects, is as close to perfection as I ever expect to find. Light and delicate, yet with a creaminess from the persistent head, and just enough fullness from the suspended yeast that really, this beer is everything anyone could want it to be, and all at the same time.  I won't mince words with drinkability. Why bother? This beer is a masterpiece, in which every single characteristic is poured over until it's honed to perfection, and then all taught to dance together in perfect harmony.  My first perfect 5 rating.  Part of me wanted to deny it this, if only to say that I still hadn't rated anything a perfect 5. But honestly, with this bottle and at this moment, it was flawless perfection. At one point in my developmental craft-beer stages, Belgian Strong Pales were some of my least favorite beers, or at least so I proclaimed. Now, however, one sits perched atop my overall rankings ladder in a seat no other can lay claim to.

T- Sweet fruit. Apple, banana and pear. Good spices to fit the bill and notes of citrus in it as well. It also has it's share of yeast. A small amount of bitterness which doesn't stand up to the sweetness all that well. Of the spices I can make out just the faintest hint of cloves. A lot of depth to the taste. It sticks around for longer than most beers after it's been downed.  M- Very rich and smooth. Medium-full body.  D- Seemingly well hidden ABV.

Very familiar scent that's more than welcome.  Sweet malty kick to start things off, followed by the citrus-y esters and a bit of wheaty banana as well. Hops show up at the end with some light bitterness that lingers into the aftertaste. Alcohol is definitely present, as the warmth bookends the flavor experience. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with a just-right amount of carbonation. Body is well-balanced. Finishes somewhat dry, but pleasingly so.  Drinkability is very good. The alcohol, while present, is never overpowering and serves to complement the rest of the flavor profile. A sipper to be sure, but it's quite tasty and you'll definitely enjoy drinking it.

Tastes delicious-Sweetness turns slightly sour on the outsides of the tongue. Hops and yeast character- mostly yeast. Great lacing on the glass. Lots o' alcohol! But I love it and you don't even notice it...until it's too late! Hahahaha!  Definitely an exceptional purchase if you are looking for an awesome Belgian beer.  Cheers!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,btorsdog,4.36,"Hard to believe a small grocery near my house sells this for $9.99 all the time, great buy! if you look up the word ""beer"" anywhere this is the picture that ought to be beside it! Golden Yellow with a slight haze to it but probably the best head ever, thick and dense, impressive! Slightly ""Grolsh"" like with a touch of white peppery skunk to it, belgian scent comes through also! taste is as gold as she looks ,slight bitter sting with a sweetening malt effect, so cleanly crisp at the end its almost frightening! medium mouth with an effervescant thing happening, somewhat dry. This is where the ""Devil"" comes into play with ya.So tasty but dry so you what more to quench that spot, Alcohol seems non-existant so you just keep pounding 'em down, Great Brew!!!!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Whiteweasel,4.32,"Drank from a pint glass and poured from a bottle.  A: Pale yellow, not the greatest colour. Great head and incredible lacing though. The consistency is suprisingly clear.  S: Luxurious, with a plethora of fruits; grapes, peaches, strawberries, and bananas with a heaping serving of clove. Belgian yeast scent comes out beautifully.  T: Malty, sweet, complex and yeasty, all similar to a Chimay. Flavours are top notch. Like a fine wine; rich like a glass of brandy.  M: Harsh on the tongue, very carbonated, and very very boozy. Quite the number on the mouth, but in a good way.  D: This beer is so damn good, but its so alcoholic that its damn near impossible to stay sober after having more than 2 or 3.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Vaison,4.35,"11.2oz bottle poured into a goblet.  A: Cloudy light yellow with a huge head that nearly towered out of the glass.  S: Immediately reminded me of a pilsner, perhaps it was the color that had me thinking that way. Smelled peppery and citric, perhaps lemon.  T: A slightly bitter hoppy start, with a fruity and citric rind middle with an alcohol push at the end.  M: Creamy head beginning, feels very light. Almost like an extra dry champagne with the way it dissipates.  D: Very easy to sip. Much lighter than the bold full taste suggests.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,AgentMunky,4.16,"Poured from a 33cL bottle into a Chimay goblet.  A: Translucent, hazy, golden, thick creamy head. Oddly clear in the center. This looks promising. Nice lacing.  S: Smells a lot like a pilsner, with some faint skunky notes and fainter spice. Pretty nice, but muddled and muted.  T: Scrumptious; exceeded my expectations. The main taste is refreshingly robust for a beer that looks so pale. There is a carbonated creaminess preceding a sharp spiciness. This spice, in turn, gives way to smooth estery malts which escort the remaining flavours -- fruit, yeast, through to the aftertaste. Aftertaste is light, ever-so-slightly dry, but with a stickiness in the back of the throat.  M: The initial mouthfeel is fizzy and encompassing, the creamy head filling the mouth. A balanced sharp-sweet effect simultaneously soothes and pricks the mouth. Very nice.  D: Drinkably smooth but still interesting. The alcohol is detectable. Not the *very* best BSPA I've ever reviewed (that honour goes to Unibroue's Don de Dieu) but Duvel is a better example of the style (indeed, probably the epitome of the Belgian Strong Pale Ale). Highly recommended; I will buy it again.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,BrewCrew2010,4.75,"A: Sometime ads exaggerate how a beer looks in real life. This beer is beautiful! A clear golden yellow sits underneath a huge frothy head. Wonderful head retention and amazing lace.  S: A light floral aroma with hints of lemon, apple, and pear. Also getting some grassy & peppery notes.  T: The initial taste is sweet acidic flavor, then goes into a short bitter phased, followed by a cereal malty finish. A dry aftertaste with hints of doughy yeast. Flavors picked up throughout the beer are Belgian yeast, banana, herbs, & spices.  M: Light body with lively carbonation. Tickles on my tongue.  D: Must drink again. Must drink again.

222,695,scottfrie,4.67,"330ml bottle into Duvel tulip! Been waiting a while to match this combination.  A: This beer has one of the most recognizable pours. When you say huge egg-whipped frothy white head, you automatically think Duvel. Head slowly receded into the bowl of the tulip forming an oily dollop of cream over the light golden liquid that stuck around until the last drop. Great head retention, amazing lace. S: Sweet pears and apples amongst peppery Belgian spices. Slight apricot and nectarine. T: Loads of Belgian spice with some fruit. Notes of clove, cardamom, pepper, banana, and herbal hops. There is an overall sweetness to the brew. Finish is lightly bitter. Aftertaste is full of banana and brown sugar. Light bubblegum and doughy yeast as well. M: Full body with a rich flavor and soft carbonation. Alcohol is masked but lends some viscosity to the body. Mouthfeel is soft and a bit chewy. Perfect. D: One of the classics. Everyone should try this beer. Even my non-craft drinking friends admit this beer is good. I could drink this again and again.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,StephenRich,4.53,"Duvel (pronounced Doo-vle) is a beers which is synonymous among beer aficionados. It is a reference point for brewers and a staple for beer drinkers.  At the LCBO Duvel is available in 330ml short capped bottles for $3.10, and is 8.5% abv. It is also available elsewhere in 750ml corked bottles, and 1.5L Magnums as shown. All bottles are bottle conditioned. This beer is a Belgian Pale Ale, and should be served cold between 4 to 7C (39 - 45F); Moortgagte suggests 6C. This will allow you to enjoy the beers magnificent quenching and refreshing characteristics, and as it warms gently, added layers of aroma and complexity will show themselves.  One of my favorite things about the Duvel is its chalice, which was designed specifically for this beer. You will notice if you stand the bottle and glass next to each other that the glass is almost double the size of the bottle; this is no mistake. The Duvel should be poured slowly on a slight angle with the glass gently rotating upright and lifting the bottle higher so that just after halfway you are pouring directly into the beer. A large and mountainous head should form a pure white clouds with massive amounts of air pockets filling it.  The head should begin close to the middle of the gold Duvel logo, and should raise to the top of the glass' lip. This may seem like a large amount of head if you are used to drinking commercial beers, however this is the perfect amount of foam for a beer like the Duvel. Its natural carbonation is going to create a luscious head no matter what you do, it is filled with rich aromas and unique flavors, and the glass was also designed specifically to allow this to happen.  Moortgat also suggests leaving about one cm of beer in the glass so that you do not pour the sediment (yeast from the bottle conditioning) into your glass. This is a personal preference. Depending on the beer, the sediment can add funky earthy flavors to the beer, or can impart a light sour or tart sensation to the beer. Personally, I think its all just more flavor. There are a couple beers which I reserve the sediment and enjoy the beer clean, however I pour every last drop of Duvel into my glass.  The beer itself is golden straw yellow and completely transparent. A laser etched ""D"" inside the bottom of the glass creates ridges for bubbles to form, and a clean stream of carbonation pours straight up the middle of every properly served Duvel, helping the head stay where it belongs.  The nose is delicate and sweet, it has very soft floral aromas of fresh hops and herbs, tickling spices, ripe soft fruits like peaches, bananas and apple, and a purely Belgian yeast character. It doesn't pour at your with riches or power; the alcohol is not close to noticeable. The Duvel thus far is very delicate and pleasing, and shows characteristics which should prove to be exceptionally refreshing.  Tilt the chalice gently towards you and be delightfully treated to a smooth and effervescent beer gliding under the head into your mouth - the chalice was designed for a purpose. The Duvel first brings soft blond malt sweetness in a complex and round group of flavors. Light malts, sweet earth, yeast and fruits all show their presence on your tongue and gently into your cheeks.  Easily, light spice and precise carbonation begin to raise your taste buds to attention as the beers floats across your palate. More hints of candy sweetness and the lightest caramel show up on your palate, and soon floral hops bring quenching dry, but soft bitterness in to balance the experience. The mouthfeel is elegant, smooth, and very refreshing. A richly carbonated beer usually is aggressive, but the carbonation here is all natural and pairs with the beer's flavors effortlessly.  Once again, the soft and hugely aromatic characteristics of the beer have created something absolutely delightful. The alcohol is perfectly hidden by this beer's balanced and layered flavors, and a severely impressive overall experience. The finish is quick, quenching, and crisp with a sweetly citrus touch - think fresh green apples. It really is a beautiful beer experience, and very deserving of its reputation.  I do love the Duvel with earthy soft cheeses, lamb, salads of almost any variety, and even grilled foods like hamburgers and shish-kabob. But mostly, I enjoy the Duvel, outside, when its hot, and I need to be confidently impressed.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

It's got a slightly hazy golden yellow body with an enormous fluffy white head that's fed by a constant stream of bubbles from the bottom. The retention is ridiculous with clumps of white foam lasting for the duration and leaving sheets of lacing. Beautiful pour.  The aroma is fresh and grassy with lightly floral hops and slightly earthy. Lemon zest with some pears and green apples mixed in.  The taste is wonderful as well. It's got an earthy hop and musty Belgian yeast presence up front which mixes perfectly with the sugar-coated pears underneath. The finish is dry, crisp and lightly tart and bitter.  The mouthfeel is effervescent with tons of carbonation. Smooth but crisp and very bubbly on the palate.  After the rare beers I've had from all over the place, it's refreshing to taste such a stunning beer that almost everyone can get. Rarity be damned, this is one of the best beers I've ever had.

222,695,ToasterChef,4.45,"Reviewed from my notes. A corked and caged 750ml bottle, best before 21/11/2012, poured into my Smuttynose Big Beer Series goblet.  The bottle opened with a loud pop. Visible vapors could be seen escaping from the chilled bottle. Pouring into my glass produces a huge white foam head. It settles into soap bubbles strung across and around the glass, like regular lacing, by in three dimensions. Lots of rising carbonation is visible in the clear straw liquid. Not too much film is left behind when I swirl the glass around, but some good lace remains.  Duvel has, to me, a great sweet Belgian aroma. It's a great mixture of candi sugar, Belgian yeast, bready malts, orange peel and coriander.  The flavor begins with some pale malts that provide a small amount of sweetness. Each sip finishes with some alcohol and a peppery bite. It's a great strong Belgian pale flavor.  You can feel a lot of carbonation in each mouthful, but it works well. The coat is slick and a little buttery (but without any butter flavors). It has a medium/ful body and a quick dry finish.  This beer is very drinkable. In a single glass, each sip goes down well. It also works over a longer session--I'll finish off this 750ml bottle myself without issue. Duvel is worthy of the praise it receives and worth seeking out.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Keffa,4.26,"Poured into a Unibroue Ephemere tulip.  A: This is the best looking beer I have had, bar none. Slightly cloudy/hazy pale yellow, rocky/fluffy sticky head that stayed around for about 10 minutes (and it wasn't a vigorous pour either) and settled into a 1/2"" cap and left lacing all over the glass. This is what a beer should look like, IMO.  S: Lemon, lightly flowery hops, cracker, a little bit of Belgian yeast, slightly musty/earthy smell in the background, a little bit of a toffee sweetness. This smells very, VERY enticing.  T: Holy crap. First taste is a lemony hop and Belgian yeast, turns into a cracker/bready like malt and a little bit of that earthy note on the aroma. Turns into a slightly fruity finish that leaves very little hint that it's such a high ABV. Extremely good flavors going on, and not one flavor takes the lead, IMO. They all play their part and do so with no problem with going into the background while another flavor comes forward.  M: Very tingly, highly carbonated, extremely smooth, almost creamy. Nice feel for sure.  D: Very easy to drink, almost to the point of being ridiculous. The slight hint every so often a slight hint of the high ABV is the only thing that keeps this from being able to be pounded away, not that you'd want to with it being 8.5%.  This is one of my new favorites. Extremely good flavor, well balanced between the Belgian yeast/floral, slightly fruity hops/cracker-like malt that shows a little sweetness. This is a Devilish brew indeed. Partake with caution. It'll get you in trouble if you aren't careful.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

I've honestly had this beer more times than I can count and I've never been able to none stop pour into any glass even when taking my time without the head getting too large. Pilsner like body that's ver very yellow and almost like champagne. Good carbonation bubbles. Smells dry, corn note, pine, citrus and little spikes of belgian sweaty funk.

Nose: Some spicy, woody notes atop a clean pale malt bill, some dry pine-y hops and a little note of corn (under-modified malt). Quite pleasant.  Palate: Lots of prickly carbonation, explosive on the palate. Some alcohol is present all the way through but the light hop bitterness sweeps it away. Some fruity flavors (apricot, pear) and some earthy/mineral notes too. Something a little wood-like from the hops. Long, but crisp finish.  Notes: An outstanding beer.

Eventually some pale malts make an appearance, as well as that unexplainable Belgian character, along with some apple, some alcohol coming through. Pretty muted overall.  Taste is a mix of sweetness and bitterness which meshes together wonderfully. The pale malts are apparent, as is the spice and yeast. Finishes very dry and refreshing.  Highly carbonated and champagne-like... once again, very refreshing.  The 8.5% ABV is quite well hidden. The refreshing aspect of this beer makes it a highly attractive option in the summer months, especially as an apperitif in place of a sparkling wine at a dinner.

T- When it hit the palate I got a lot of malt, faint banana, some pepper, and just a hint of coriander. It hits very crisp. then balances out, and has a slight bitter and medicinal aftertaste. This aftertaste: however, cleanses the palate and makes you want to take another pull off the glass.  M- starts off crisp and light and then seems to me to seamlessly progress to a medium mouth-feel with a crisp but fading ending.  D- Its not called Duvel for nothing. Each sip/drink/slug leaves you wanting more, and at its 8.5% abv will quickly knock you on your arse. A 4 pack of these and I want to go to sleep, but then again, I'm an old fart at 50+.  ~notes!~ I'm new to this. I stumbled across BA while surfing. I new nothing about beer other than American macros until I went into the Marines. Back then I thought Kirin and San Miguel were fantastic. The Corona Blitz hit but I didn't like it that much but found I did like Dos XX Amber. Ive been trying the higher rated beers I've found on this site and have been pretty much in agreement; Except for Porters...I just don't like them.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,mlazzaro,4.46,"clear golden, perfectly carbonated with exception looking head. mountainous head that is holding up quite nicely.  smells like yeasty banana esters. Might be older bottle, because I could use a little hop aroma in the smell.  Deeelicious taste. No abjectable flavors at all. Balanced, suiting bitterness. And it is kind of menacingly delicious, especially considering the decent 8.5 ABV. The alcohol is completely masked by the flavors. I was a bit shocked to read the % .  This was my first Duvel, and I can't believe I ignored it for so long. I think the reason might have been because it was a touch expensive @ 11.2 oz bottle for $4.45. But worth the experience of a good beer. I could sip this all night, (or all day.)",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,geryeb624,4.83,"Poured from 330 mL bottle into DFH signature glass.  A- Pours a light golden with gigantic fluffy white head. At least 3 fingers worth. One of the nicest pours I've ever seen. Head hangs around forever as well. Leaves behind a ton of lacing.  S- Spicy Belgian yeast with possible cloves and cinnamon. Also a tart fruitiness reminiscent of citrus and green apples.  T- Malty and smooth, almost reminds me of a witbier with less spice and a lot more flavor. Spiciness and fruitiness due come through however. Finished dry and crisp with a taste of green apple.  M- Very smooth with high carbonation.  D- Dangerously drinkable. Hides its 8.5% very well, and goes down as easy as a light beer. Perfect for a hot summer day.  I have had Duvel before, but in a pint glass, and it was good. Now having it in a proper snifter, I can say this may be one of the best beers I have ever tasted. Smooth, refreshing, and absolutely delicious.

A moderate amount of carbonation is visible. S: The smell isn't that strong, but there are notes of citrusy and floral hops in the nose along with some hints of fruit, spices and yeast. T: The taste is similar to the aroma but is much stronger and has flavors of apples, bananas, pears, spices and yeast. There's a sight amount of bitterness in the finish. Some alcohol is noticeable, but it doesn't detract from the taste. M: It feels light-bodied, crisp and very highly carbonated on the palate. There's also a significant amount of dryness. D: The beer is very easy to drink because the alcohol is well hidden.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,mgbickel,4.28,"Poured from a 330ml bottle into a Duvel tulip. The pour produced one of the thickest, fluffiest heads I have ever seen. The snow-white foam lasted throughout the entire drink, receding only slightly and leaving tons of abstract swirls and patterns all over the glass walls. The body is a hazy golden-yellow that grows more deep and intense toward the center of the glass.  The nose has multiple layers of light fruits, spices, yeast and sweet malts.  The taste is just as complex as the nose, if not more so. Pale malts kick things off and quickly fade into middle that finds a great combination of yeast and spices. The finish turns a little sweeter before a (slightly) bitter finish.  The mouth feel is on the thicker side of medium, creamy with a sticky finish; mild carbonation.  The ABV of this is hidden very well making this a very drinkable beer. If you are a fan of the style, this is one of the best beers being produced today.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,JukeboxEmperor,4.2,"A: Poured into a Duvel tulip glass. Four-finger thick, foamy head that's reluctant to disappear. Very pale straw color, much closer a pislner than the other big names of this style that I've tried.  S: Lightly floral and fruity plus a noticeable amount of alcohol.  T: Much like the smell. Very light and alcohol is very present. It reminds me of a light macro lager, but with the ale's fruityness and less adjunct flavor which ultimately makes it enjoyable.  M: Everything else about this beer is light and subtle, but the mouthful is thick and not nearly as light as the taste and smell. It's quite the contrast.  D: I've never been able to keep Duvel in my glass for very long; unlike the other beers in this style, which I can usually keep around for at least 15 minutes. It's so light and subtle that it goes down like a Miller Lite, though I've had to hold back this time to write a review.  notes: This would be good with food because of its high drinkability and abv.

Pours a clear, very pale yellow with lightly rising carbonation and a beautiful billowy, rocky white head that has probably the best retention I've seen. The aroma is of spicy, peppery yeasts upfront, and a light floral and tart fruitiness. The flavor is of more spicy yeast and a lemony, floral backing. A slight boozy finish comes through as it warms. The mouthfeel is a very pleasant medium to full body with good carbonation throughout the duration of the beer. This is a very enjoyable beer, and I can definitely see why this is considered one of the staples of Belgian beers. This is easily something I will look forward to enjoying a few of in the future.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Delightful.  And oh, the taste - butter smoothness, I catch clove right away. The yeast is well done as well, as I'm pretty sure I'm getting some coriander in there. This is truly sublime.  The mouthfeel is outstanding - the balance is some of the best I've ever experienced in a beer. I have to hand it to the Belgians - they really know how to do yeast. And the carbonation was beautiful - bubbles from the opening to the last drink.  Great drinking beer; I could make a night of this one, with a nice barbequed chicken sandwich.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,oatmealjunior,4.71,"My 2nd ever BA review on one of my longtime favorite brews. Poured into a tulip from a 330 ml stubby bottle.  A: Sublime, pure-white head, it almost makes you giggle with surprise at the shear size of it, an easy 4 fingers that keeps a pretty solid retention throughout. I don't know if you could call it ""lacing"", more like ""chunking"", giant craggy cliffs of meringue-like foam left behind on the sides of the glass and on top of the brew itself which was a beautifully clear pale-gold color until i disturbed the yeast and it became a little more hazy and somehow more gold in color. I've never seen anything like it -5.0  S: The smell is very subtle, strong scent of pastoral hay, light citrus and apple with some distinct peppery belgian yeast. Nice, but nothing mind-blowing -4.0  T: This is one area where Duvel shines in my opinion, it has all the flavors you'd expect from a belgian; the peppery yeast, apple skin, grapefruit, hay, banana phenols, light pilsner-esque hops and bright, sweet toasted wheat, maybe a touch of corriander. The only difference is the extreme balance achieved by duvel, every time you think one flavor is taking a dominant role, you take another sip and the flavor changes leaving you want to explore deeper. Also, alcohol content should be discussed here; with an 8.5% abv, you'd expect to taste some alcohol, and you do, especially as the brew warms. But its as if all the other flavors come in to perfectly support and mask it ever so slightly, the alcohol adds to the taste rather than detracts. One word to describe duvel's flavor? ""elegant"" 5.0  M: Champagne-like carbonation, airy/cloudy head. It starts out juicy and creamy gets sort of dry towards the middle where you're introduced to some warmth from the alcohol content and it ends sort of tart and sweet, leaving you wanting another sip. Very nice -4.5  D: This is where the ""Devil"" moniker comes into its own. So light, crisp and refreshing for an 8.5% brew, just the slightest hint of alcohol and each sip leaves you craving another one. Endlessly drinkable, if i could drink only one beer for the rest of my life, it would be duvel, hands-down. i had to struggle to keep some in the glass to finish the review -5.0  Overall, I'll admit i'm slightly bias. The first time i tried this beer i was living in india at the time, and had nothing but terrible terrible beer for months, until a friend of mine offered me an unassuming glass of pale, yellow beer which i assumed to be either carlsberg or tuborg . . . until it hit my tongue. he said that i had the biggest, most over-the-top, cartoonish double-take after my first sip as my mouth filled with the golden nectar. i wasn't expecting it and was absolutely floored by the depth and complexity. I thought i was looking through rose-colored glasses without having anything decent to compare it to for months, so i was cautious when i went to taste it again back in the states, and was pleasantly surprised when i found it just as heavenly as the first sip. I cannot rave enough about this beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

T- It has a very yeasty taste with strong hints of fruit.  M- Very balanced mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation and smoothness.

Light carbonation.  Taste: Sweet belgian yeast which is noticed both while the liquid is in the mouth and and ater swallowing. The aftertaste is a bit hoppy and a bit of sweet candy.

Sitting still on the table the super active carbonation grew the head. Two minutes later the head sat two fingers. Cool !  The head truly deserves special note as the half inch head lasting the entire session is dense and clumpy, I could be looking down out an airplane window !  The malt aroma is crystal, pure. Delicate green fruit, blended subtle spices. Superb !  If all of Belgium was condensed to a single brew - this is it. Seems kinda silly describing the flavors, it's an icon, an archetype and my opinion doesn't matter.

A: Even a careful pour into the cavernous Duvel tulip produces four fingers of fluffy, eggshell white head. Retention is outstanding; the foam recedes slowly and collapses in clumps, leaving tons of sticky lace down the glass. The body itself is a pale straw color, perfectly clear, with active effervescence. This is what the 5.0 is made for.  S: Green apples, lemon zest, grass, spice (pepper or clove). The last time I had Duvel, largadeer kicked it over the floor and spilled some on himself, smelling like yeast. The aroma brings back memories.  T: Hops for sure: the flavor brings to mind a Noble pilsner. Grassy, lemon, leafy presence that supplements pale malt. Green apple and pear are noticeable, and there's a light spiciness (clove) in the finish. The aftertaste evokes hints of tea and earth. I gather this is a pretty fresh bottle.  M: Very crisp, giving the impression of being light-bodied. Well carbonated and it massages the tongue.  D: An outstanding beer.

T- Starts off with the hint of fruity apple character that melds into the Belgium yeast character and finally into a sharp spicy yeast characteristics. A warming alcohol sensation helps to finish the beer as the yeast characteristics linger.  M- Medium mouthfeel with a very pleasant amount of carbonation as the beer finishes dry in the mouth.

The head leaves tons of lacing, and ten minutes after the fact it's still 2+ fingers high. Damn impressive. The nose is of pale malt sweetness and spicy flavors from the yeast, and it's very good but it's not quite worthy of a perfect score. Each sip leads off with some juicy sweetness, apples and pears. A flash of white pepper-led spicy flavors follows, before closing with an aggressive hop bite. Served cold Duvel is quite crisp, but as it warms up the mouthfeel becomes a bit more chewy and lets the various flavors linger around a little bit longer. Either way, it's delicious, and the high yet creamy carbonation ties everything together nicely.

Strong, clear golden color that is very reminiscent of white wine.  Smell- Again, very reminiscent of white wine. Crisp apple, mild spice, and a bit of a bite of yeast.  Taste- Starts off with a hit of yeast, followed by a slightly juicy apple taste and fruity malt, and finishes with a wonderfully bitter bit of hops. The alcohol is definitely evident but not unpleasant. The hint of white wine similarity is in the taste as well.  Mouthfeel- So crisp and creamy that it practically begs to not be put down. Trust me, it's hard putting down long enough to write this. The bubbly carbonation tingles the back of the throat.

Maybe I've been drinking too many wit beers lately, but clove stood out. Not a long finish at all. Fades very quickly. Overall well balanced, though.  M- Light to medium. I didn't notice anything worth jotting down on my notes.  D- High drinkability. Smooth and refreshing, but it lacks something that makes me want to drink it often. I've had a lot of other beers lately that seem to wish they were this one.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,mostpoetsdo,4.09,"A: Poured into the Duvel glass that I got in a four pack of Duvel. Came for the glass, stayed for the beer. Pours a hazy straw colored gold, with an absolutely huge, booming head of billowy white dreams. One of the best beers I've seen, leaving behind good lacing.  S: Can pick up some spices and citrus, but overall underwhelming.  T: The taste makes up for the smell. Definitely don't drink it too cold. Crisp fruity taste, citrus, a munch of malt. The spices are rather subtle, but make the beer. Tiny bit of alcohol present as well.  M: Super smooth and creamy, not that boozy, very easy to put down.  D: Duvel is good, don't get me wrong, but the price to satisfaction ratio isn't that high. The glass, however, is incredible, and worth the purchase alone.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,thagr81us,4.1,"Served from bottle into a Duvel tulip. Pours a hazy pale yellow with a two finger pure white head. Maintains nice lacing throughout. The aroma is comprised of only subtle fruit. The flavor is of malt, fruit, and subtle alcohol. It was light on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this is an excellent brew. This was actually my first time trying it believe it or not... I am totally happy it is readily available in my area and that the one I bought came with 3 friends. I will be consuming his friends in the near future.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,carolinabeerguy,3.91,"Poured from a 11.2 oz. bottle into a Chimay goblet. Best before: 11 2012.  Appearance: Pours light golden color full of carbonation bubbles. Features a 2-3 finger white foamy head reminiscent of soap suds. Excellent head retention and lacing throughout.  Smell: Crisp carbonation and hoppy bitterness up front with a hint of sweetness. Middle has a hint of spice and lemon rind. Finish is mildly bitter.  Taste: Excellent blend of malt and dried fruits. Light hints of alcohol at the finish. Nice dried fruit aftertaste. Absolutely delicious.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a high amount of carbonation up front. Fairly dry finish with just a small amount of alcohol burn.  Drinkability: High drinkability. The 8.5% ABV is masked well.  Overall: Very good beer that gets better as it warms up. I'm not quite as high on it as some other reviews I've read, but I would definitely recommend trying it.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

This head is retained(though not at this size, through the duration of the experience. There's a small stream of carbonation coming from the center-bottom of the glass which also lasts all drink long. I almost cried.  S- Smells sweet and cidery, you know, like apples with a small touch of yeast.  T- The smells remain consistent with the taste, taste and smell are ditto.  M- Feels like champagne. There's a soft carbonation feel on the tongue, not prickly nor uncomfortable. No alcohol astringency. The 8.5% ABV is hidden well.  D- Don't stop.  If I can say this about any beer, it's this one: brewed masterfully. Practically perfect in every way.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Started with approx 3.5 inched of fluffy foam in the glass but no problem getting a sip through.It was a hazy pale yellow in the glass. I purchased this at the EMart in Seoul and it showed an expiration date of Nov 2012. Nice taste and mouthfeel. I did not get overtaken by the purported 8.5% ABV but maybe it will catch me later. A lttle fruity maybe pears and citrus. I am not great at identifying the flavours: I can just tell you if they don't taste right. I look forward to trying this again.

222,695,Beerandraiderfan,3,"Pours a pale yellow, very fizzy and carbonated, similar to apple juice in appearance and aroma.  Taste, very fruity, must be the yeast, but lacking hop character, and is extremely hot on the alcohol. Tastes like it might be 18 rather than 8%. More apple downward bottle. Can't really say this one was enjoyable, but this kind of thing has never really been my style. Next time I score a bottle on a whim, I'm gonna age it. I like big extreme beers, but this just tastes like a macro as if its a boilermaker (i.e. a shot of alcohol in the beer).  Too expensive and rough to get through to rate any better on the drinkability scale.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,cakirkl,4.55,"A - Poured into a tulip, nearly a 4 finger head! A light golden color; a little too light might be confused for a dark adj. lager. That head is sticking around for some time; it's a bright white, thick but also fluffy. The lacing left is thick rings from every sip; it makes up for the slightly light coloring. It is begging to get marked down for the light coloring which slightly disturbs me, but 4.5 gets the nod.  S - The head is so big I can't stick my nose into the glass. Gives off a light pear, brown sugar, sweet smell. Also getting some golden fruit, bananas, and a slight bit of cloves. Smells good!  T - Finally the head has reduced itself to about 2.5 fingers, I'll try it now. I had this beer right as I began drinking craft beer, and I thought, this beer doesn't have much on it. My palate is a bit more developed now, I must say, I'm floored by this. It's nearly a delicate beer, but oh so good! Getting a slight mix of everything from the nose, a bit less pear, and ever so slight alcohol which holds the beer together. There is no one dominant flavor, just a swirling mix of wonderful-ness. I wish something would stand out to me, but it doesn't, which is what keeps it from a 5; though it is very much flirting with perfection.  M - Also something I thought of right when I had the first sip. Superb! Everything works together nicely, and the alcohol on the back end of the tongue keeps this beer from going a little bit light, perfection.  D - I must say, the 8.5% is masked quite well. But as it warms up a bit, it is slowly becoming a bit more boozy. That's just nitpicking, but I'm enjoying it thoroughly as my nightcap. Sits around a 4.25 but I can't justify a 4 but can justify a 4.5.  Overall: This is a wonderful beer to try. If you haven't, do it.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,jlapennas,4.11,"Aroma: Fruity with a bit of Pils malt in the background. Fruit aromas remind me of peaches and orange. No hops detected. There is a sweet creamy note to the aroma, the overall effect almost reminds me of a orange creamsicle. Fairly subtle alcohol in the background.  Appearance: Extremely clear straw gold. Beautiful billowing head that never fades much. Classic Duvel appearance.  Flavor: Fruity notes and crisp carbonation dominate at first leading into some malty sweetness and a bitter dry finish. Finishes with a bit of warming alcohol but pretty smooth considering it's such a big beer. As in the aroma, the esters are not the same as I remember from past bottles. I'm getting a lot of flavors that remind me more of Maredsous beers, not the Duvel of my memory/imagination.  Mouthfeel: Very highly carbonated and dry. Refreshing when cold. Great.  Overall: I've experienced a fair amount of inconsistency in this beer over the last couple years and this particular one adds to the puzzle. There's absolutely nothing wrong with it but it's not the same or as good as some other bottles I've had. As mentioned above, reminds me very much of Maredsous in it's yeast character and it also seems a bit sweeter than I remember.

222,695,djmichaelk,4.55,"375ml bottle into a Sam Adams perfect pint.  A - Hazy golden, the color of straw. Huge pillowy four-finger head that takes its time to recede to a thin cap with big chunks of foam hanging around. Lots of patchy lacing and rings around the glass. Very nice looking beer.  S - Lots of candied fruits, brown sugar, and maybe just a hint of pineapple. While it's light, it's definitely a Belgian ale.  T - This is definitely a better beer at cellar temps. Fridge temps kill the subtlety. Apricot, plum, and figs dominate. Dark sugar and a little malt.  M - You can't review this beer without talking about the carbonation, and those tiny bubbles are definitely one of the best points of this beer. Very champagne-like, and it makes this one of the best-feeling beers on the planet. This is one of the reasons people keep coming back to this one over and over.  D - While it says 8.5%, it certainly doesn't feel like it. Very light and fresh tasting, and I feel like I could drink a case of it without any issue.  Overall - This is THE benchmark for the style, and it shows. This is the beer that others (of the style) strive to reproduce. The absolute best thing I can say about it is that even with the incredible options that I have here in California, I still buy a bottle of this almost every week.

This beer smells of cider, flowers, beautiful nose that is slightly pungent but not overpowering.  Taste. Ah, it gets even better. Malts not easiy discernible, sweetness of apple, some acidity tasting of lemon or lime, beautifully balanced with hops. The high ABV of this beer is barely discernible, no wonder it's named ""Duvel.""  What can you say? Sometimes the hype is justified. First tried this as a poor college kid wandering Europe, not sure how I got my hands on it then but it was a revelation. This beer is the equivalent of a Bordeaux first-growth, a Chateau Margaux of the beer world. In other words, one of the world's great beers. And you can try it for the price of a sandwich.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,seh410,4.76,"Appearance: The beer itself is a cloudy opaque golden hue. It's topped by a thick, foamy, lacy white head - its so fluffy and white that it looks like meringue, like a beer baked Alaska. The thick head lingers, almost like foam on a cappuccino. It leaves lace on the sides of the glass and floats on the middle like melted whipped cream. It's fantastic looking.  Aroma: You can definitely smell the high alcohol volume &#8594; it's gives off a hint of sticky sweetness in the background. On second whiff, it smells thick almost... it has a very rich aroma with hints of banana (?) and citrusy spice  Taste: This is fantastic. Jumped to the top of my list after the first sip. It tastes full and rich and creamy but yet very light and refreshing. It warms in the mouth (that's the high alcohol content showing itself) and tastes of yeast with hints of fruit. SO good.  Mouthfeel: So creamy but also light and fresh. It feels good going down for sure.  Drinkability: Absolutely. I could easily polish off a couple of these (not that I'd want to or should with that 8.5% ABV).

222,695,Daniell,4.95,"L: forgetting how generous Duvel's head is I overpour, resulting in too much head. Colour is actually very pretty. At first I think hoegaarden but then I realize it's darker than that and kind of more cloudy, especially when it's help up to light and it's kind of golden. The head is excellent too despite my overpour. It just sticks around. And the lacing. It stays there. It just sticks to the glass like a bunch of clouds. This has to be a 5.  S: predominantly citrus. Candied cumquats perhaps? Something herbal/medicinal in there too. Trying another approach after drinking a bit, I'm thinking sour lemons with some dust. Or maybe orange marmalade or even lemonade. Later after eating some beef bake I get some really amazing juicy pineapple. Almost like putting your nose up to a ripe pineapple in a store to check if it is indeed fresh. It even carries some of the circumstantial aromas you get in that sort of scenario, if you know what I mean. Kind of like the earthiness and nuttiness and even the sulfur and sweetness of the pineapple. I also almost get the rubberiness of Orval in there. 5  T: reminds me a bit of Orval but without the bandaids I so dislike. Tropical fruits, sulfur, herbs, bitters. I like the way you gulp it down and it finishes on the bitters, which linger around. They're kind of mild and very balanced though so you end up with a very ""wholesome"" taste in the mouth afterwards. I think this aspect of the beer is excellent. Later on I also get pineapple in the taste. 5  M: Not that carbonated but I think I released the carbonation earlier. It's certainly not a problem for me. Might revise when I next have it (which should be very soon) 4.5  D: the only thing which would prevent me having about 8 of these is desire to preserve my liver and feeling bad about not appreciating the complexities of the beer as I get drunker and drunker (oh, and the price). 5  I had this one after delirium tremens which is supposedly in the same style (I think they are worlds apart). I did find Duvel markedly better than that beer, particularly as it seemed to keep on giving so that may have influenced my ratings. Definitely a world-class beer though and I will make sure to buy it a bit more often and try the bomber version.  Edit: I recently had it while out and was less blown away by it.

And most interestingly, there's this stream of bubbles constantly rising up from the center of the bottom of the glass. It's like an underwater volcano! I've never seen that in any other beer.  Smell: That archetypical Belgian yeasty smell. Fruity tones, as well.  Taste: Wow, now this is interesting. I'm not sure what to make of this. It tastes dry, kind of bitter, but it's not the hoppy bitterness I'm used to. Alcohol is present, that's for sure, making this a 'warm' beer going down. The fruitiness I detected in the smell is nowhere in the taste. In fact, this is probably the least sweet Belgian-type beer I've ever had. Actually, it's spicy in a slightly lemony way. Very complex.  Mouthfeel: Dry, light-medium body.  Drinkability: This is definitely a sipper. It's too complex to just gulp down. It demands the drinker to take his time and try to pick everything apart. I enjoy doing that, so this is a definite winner.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Poured in a crisp, clear pale moonlight yellow until I soiled it with the lees, because I do love my x-tra yeast. Juicy and cloudy it did become.  The scent is powerful and provocative. Clove-ish, spicy yeast and a warming, rounded phenolic aroma that assures you pleasure will be had.  When it touches your lips and then your tongue and the inside of your mouth, the warm spiciness boldly propagates. A touch of mellow peachy fruitiness ferries the elixir down your throat. A sense of well-being springs up from the depths while an aftershock of sedation follows soon after.  Yeah, this is good.

Whiffs of orange zest and hint of pineapple last throughout. A light vodka-like alcohol vapor is noticed. Bold sweet malty tastes meld well with a multi-layered hop bitterness and bite. Sweet liquidy sugar and tart orange flavors mingle with the edgy citrusy bitterness. A hint of leather and tobacco create some unexpected, yet welcome depth and character. A fine effervesence creates its own one-of-a-kind fizzy body. It sort of reminds me of a Mimosa.

Mouthfeel was light and crisp with ample carbonation. Strongly reminiscent of dry champagne with a nice balance of banana, light biscuit, and mild spice.

Really need to get sufficient glassware for my new hobby.  Appearance: Poured carefully (as the bottle advertises) and still watched it launch to the top of my glass like a mad scientist's explosive experiment. Half an hour later a quarter-inch of the head is still there, giving me a mustache with every sip. I've only tried about a hundred beers, and this is a beautiful as it gets.  Smell: Takes a couple of whiffs, but I pick up nudges of pine and lemon. Reminds me of the rampant summer shandies that are infesting the local bars about this time of year.  Taste: Head has honey that quickly transitions to an enjoyably bitter aftertaste. Drinking brings a deep fruity feel at the kickoff with a malty answer at halftime. Expected it to finish bitter like the head (especially after warming up in the glass) but I get instead a pleasant, balanced lingering taste instead. Wonderful.  Mouthfeel: Thick and fizzy, but not soda-fountain fizzy. I still feel it like a lip-balm.  Drinkability: I'd drink these all day if it had a lower alcohol content.

Appearance: Bright yellow with the largest richest head you will ever witness, the head will not dissipate and the lacing is extraordinary.

Perfect hop balance with the perfect amount of bitterness. This is the mother of all Belgian pale ales.  Mouth feel: Excellent carbonation, extremely smooth and well balanced.  Drinkability: Could run with the Duvel for as long as consciousness would allow.  A beer that is a ""must have on hand"" all year round.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,llllDrGONZOllll,4.03,"12oz bottle poured into my Russian River Stemmed glass  A yellow ale with fluffy white soapy looking head. A mix of large and small bubbles cling to one another forming a head that forms a giant mountain of head above the rim. Tons of carbonation bubbles are rushing to the suffice, reminds me of cream soda.  Aromas of pears and fruity yeast com through in the nose the most prominent. A bread like quality is coming through on the sweeter side as the ale warms. Booze and tannins are there as well but not in a offensive way, much more inviting.  The taste is very dry and the carbonation scrubs the pallet. The ale has a nice balance of hop bite with peach and pear bready yeast flavor. The alcohol burn is chased away quickly leaving very little aftertaste. This delicate Belgian is how champagne should taste. A thin body appears even thinner through all of the carbonation making it an easy drinker. You will not find many beers that come in this strong that are this easy to drink.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,PintOHops,4.23,"Glass - Tulip  A - Mostly clear yellow/gold color with lots of fine bubbles rising to the top. Produced 2-3 fingers of fluffy head, somewhat soapy looking as well. Retention is great, and it left lots of splashy lacing.  S - Very dry & champagne like, I get grape skin, some pear upfront. Beneath the dry champagne like qualities is soft banana & clove, it's mildly spicy with a bit of tangerine peel or orange peel in there somewhere, maybe a bit of pepper.  T - Very very yeasty with soft, delicate banana & clove, unfolding into pair & apple like notes that are intertwined in the yeasty goodness! A bit dry with sour/tart grape notes on the finish, and long musky yeast flavors that linger just a bit. I did notice some alcohol but man is it hidden well! Delicate yet very simple.  M - Soft & smooth with just a touch of carbonation, medium in body.  D - Everything about this beer seemed just so delicate, I thought it was very simple in both taste & smell, which was nice. The drinkability has gotta be pretty damn high on this one, as It tasted like 7% around room temp! I'm not big on the style but I'd have this one again sometime. Definitely recommended. Cheers!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,JosiahS,3.8,"Poured into a tulip glass. Produced a fizzy white head, 1/2 finger but it seems to be sticking around nicely. Color is straw yellow, very clear with noticeable carbonation bubbles floating to the surface.  Aroma is of bubblegum, coriander, pepper, lemon rind, yeast and a light fruit, maybe pear and the faintest smell of banana. Slightly dry as well.  The mouthfeel is light and delicate with medium carbonation but a bit harsh going down.  Bubblegum carries over from the aroma, along with coriander and a dryness that reminds me of wine. Tart grape is definitely present and followed throughout the pallete. Finishes tart, slightly sweet, bitter and faintly harsh yet clean with little to no lingering flavor except the occasional bubblegum and tart apple. The flavors marry much better as it warms to room temperature, easing the bit of harshness to a muted state.  It's dry. leaves me wanting more to quench my thirst yet no amount satisfies. This is a style of beer that i can respect but don't favor all that much.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Takahiro,3.28,"From 750ml bottle into my Duvel Tulip glass it's been years since I tasted it before. This is the first Duvel after I got into drinking Belgian style beers.  Looks straw light-pale color, very clear. fluffy 1.5"" white foam that lasts a while bubble size varies  smellls sweet fruit up front. I also pick up lager-like characteristics in the back ground. smell is ""rounded"" sweetness (not sharp), and some yogurt (i pick this one up in saison I recently brewed).  taste fruity. Some sweetness, which is different from maltiness/body. as a matter of fact, the body is fairly light. there's some soury yogurty (rounded) flavor, which I tend to pick up from strong Belgian beers. May be some ""wheaty"" characteristics, i don't know.  I notice that some of the sweetness comes from alcohol, which I feel very well in the after taste.  this one leans towards hoppiness, which seem to intermingle with the alcohol in the after taste.  it's drinkable, but not as good as I thought it would be. may be related to ""bad"" handling before it got to my mouth.  will try again.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,timholio,4.03,Finally had this. I think I prefer Russian Rivers 'golden ale' which is called 'Damnation' and it compares nicely to this one. The duvel is VERY SMOOTH espeically considering the high ABV. Its not really complicated. Very easy to drink which is impressive considering its over 8%. Not one of my top 10 beers because its a little to boring especially for a potent brew.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,AleWatcher,4.06,"I poured this into my Duvel tulip, as is only right.  About time I actually reviewed this beer, so here goes-- Pours a pale straw colored golden with tones of carbonation. Huge fluffy white head climbed 4 fingers, to the top of the glass. The head is very thick and sticky, leaving giant chunks of lace everywhere it travels.  This smells a little like apple juice, with some sweet malts and a light floral hop note. There is also that unmistakable Belgian yeast smell too... The sweet malts and floral hop hit first on the tastebuds, but give way to the dry, slightly funky, little spicy, and completely delicious yeast notes. There is a crisp clean finish to this beer that reminds me of a fresh apple... This is quite refreshing and easy to drink with its fairly light body and ample carbonation. This one could pack a punch with 8.5% ABV, and it hides that alcohol so well, you would never see it coming.  This is the measuring bar with which all other Belgian strong pale ales and golden ales try to compete. And it is highly regarded with good reason. It is quite delicious, and a feat of excellence to balance a beer so nicely with that high an ABV.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,alli4051,4.5,"Poured from a bottle into Duvel tulip.  Pours a light, pure golden color. Produces a foamy white head that never completely dissipates and leaves lots of lacing. Smell is the quintessential Belgian yeast tones. Taste is again yeasty and finishes with some fruity notes. As it warms flavors become more pronounced and even more appealing. Mouthfeel is crisp, clean, and refreshing. Drinkability is superb with this one. I was actually surprised to find the abv clocked in at 8.5%. Ive been growing a distaste for Belgian styles; however, this experience has me completely rethinking the style entirely, that's how good it is.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,ROCKETMAN998,4.35,"11.2 oz bottle poured into Duvel tulip. Best before Jan 2011  Pours a bright golden almost pilsner like color, semi cloudy with a humongous head that dissipates quickly to an 1/8 inch layer. Good streaky lacing  Smell is yeasty, slightly sweet and fruity. can smell a bit of alcohol  Sweet malty flavors introduce the taste well with a bit of sour apple before a touch of bitter hops round it out and linger for bit. Very well balanced and delicious hiding the alcohol well.  Mouthfeel is light and inviting, highly carbonated and smooth. Has a clean, dry somewhat crisp finish.  Drinkability is very high even with the 8.5 ABV. Must be careful. Good summertime beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,xylophonica,3.45,"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a Duvel glass.  A - Dark, golden amber colour. Some sediment floating around with lots of bubbles. Thick head with thick lacing developing. A mountain of froth would be an understatement.  S - Sweet mild scent. Hints of banana and mango with some vanilla thrown in. Smells somewhat like a mild wheat beer. Maybe a bit of bubblegum as well.  T - Sweet. A bit of spicy banana with some vanilla. Aftertaste is slightly smoother than the early bitterness would suggest - almost herbal in nature.  M - More bitter than I'd expected. Bitey, with a lot of carbonation present. Nothing special.  D - Not a bad beer but not something I'd want to drink over and over again. Carbonation actually makes it a bit gassy so might be an issue to drink more than a couple. Herbal flavours become more obvious as you drink which is good but then so does the alcohol content which is not so good.  I first drank this beer a few months ago and wasn't really impressed. However I thought I'd give it another go for the sake of the positive reviews it's had here (and the fantastic glass!) Once again I don't think it lives up to the hype. Personal preference in this style of beer would be Kwak over this anyday.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,uconnroller,4.05,"This beer pours a murky yellow color. Has a very large head at first, give it a minute and it will go away, but continues to have a transient lace head retention. You should pour this beer slowly with the glass angled.  Smells yeasty with a mixture of bananas, citrus hops, and apple. Definitely a Belgium.  Tastes is not as strong as it smells.  A surprisingly light body for such a murky looking beer. There was a lot of carbonation. Drink up before the carbonation disappears. Very smooth beer, very easy to drink.  A good Belgian beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,goldbot,4.15,"330 mL bottle. Best by 09/2012.  Pours clear golden yellow with thick, white, fluffy head. Lots of active carbonation. The picture perfect Belgian ale pour as expected.  Aroma is dominated mostly by spicy, floral and slightly sour Belgian yeast notes. Also some sweeter notes of bready malt and wheat.  Sweet malty flavor notes with bits of apple or other fruit and a very slight bubblegum. Bready with a touch of caramel perhaps. Floral yeast notes linger throughout.  Silky carbonation, light to medium body. Overall a nice example of Belgian beer; A great showcase of the various flavors and aromas a good Belgian yeast offers.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Kinsman,4.18,"330ml bottle poured into tulip glass. Best before date: May 2012  Pours a brilliant clear golden color right up to the bottom, when the yeast is introduced to the glass, adding a slight haze. The tiniest of bubbles work their way up the glass to greet the larger than lift white head.  Sweet fruity accents greet the nose, hinting at apples and complimented by a yeasty spiciness unlike any other.  First taste is a whole boat load of flavors on the palate. Lots of sweetness from the malt but well balanced by a slightly earthy character before the spice makes it way through. Peppery and clove-like spice make a strong showing before another round of a candy sweetness lead you to the finish. Noble hops contribute a musty herbal note to this finish, helping round out the beer. Medicinal phenols and warming alcohol notes may be a bit too much but they don't take that much away from the beer.  With so much going on at 8.5% abv, this has a surprisingly lighter feel than one would expect. Quite a strong carbonation seems to be a bit too much. Overall Duvel sets a high standard for the style and certainly one that shouldn't be missed.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,jpittman80,4.83,"one of my all-time favorites, a true world classic. It's quite clear, golden, and full of foamy white head that's leaves the tell-tale Belgian lace. Aroma of spice from the yeast, tiny hint of hops and light fruit, maybe apples. The taste - it's almost impossible to describe the relative complexity (for such a light beer), but of course, I'll try. Peppery sweetness initially, it mellows in the middle to a yeasty fruity balance, and finishes a little dryer than one would expect with the perfect amount of hop bitterness and flavor. You would never know that this packs a whopping 8.5%. Truly, a masterful and artful blending of all things that mark great brewing.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,pharmer,4.54,"Pours a pale yellow color, almost surprisingly pale in fact. Head is white and fluffy and laces nicely all the way down the glass,  Smells of cloves, yeast and very faintly banana.  Tastes very similar to the smell, but so much more complex. Starts sweet, then as the carbonation releases on the tongue, some hoppy bitterness kicks in. This beer is quite highly carbonated, reminds me of champagne actually. Finishes dry and warm with alcohol, makes me want another sip.  This beer's drinkability is probably too high actually, because at 8.5% ABV, one could end up on the wrong side of intoxicated in a hurry. Highly recommend this one for any serious beer lover.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,jpro,4.68,"Wow... finally getting around to trying this. Pours a brilliant pale gold, with lively carbonation - and crystal clear (managed to keep the yeast sediment in the bottle). The cloud-white head is pretty massive and leaves a few patches of lace on the glass. Carbonation keeps a steady stream of small bubbles rising up from the bottom. There's a nice ring of foam that manages to stick around after most of the head dissipates. Aroma is of fruit (apple/pear), spice and yeast. Taste is so clean... again, there's a touch of pear, followed by pepper and a light touch of grain and some sweetness. Alcohol and/or medicinal notes peek through. Mouthfeel is crisp, lively and pretty light on the palate. Drinkability is exceptional - it's almost impossible to put the glass down. Hard to believe we're talking 8.5% here - completely unnoticeable. Delicious...",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,beerwolf77,4.51,Dead horse meet stick. For my own record keeping here's my review.  Poured into my Duvel tulip the beer is a almost pastel golden hue. The head is something to behold. Three full fingers of pillowy stark white goodness. The retnetion and lace are of epic proportions.  The aroma is sweet and lighlty spiced. Some fruit notes along with a heavy yeast character. There's just a touch of dry book dust.  The flavor is smooth and complex. The light sweetness gently melts into a dry yeastiness. This is then followed with spices and candied fruits. Touches of hop bitterness poke around on your tongue periodically. No sign of the ABV at all.  Light to medium body. As crisp as a fresh apple in the mouth.  Overall an outstanding beer that will knock you on your ass if you don't respect it. A true classic.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Sean9689,4.21,"Bottle poured into Duvel (what else?) tulip glass.  A - Pours a mirky golden blond with two fingers-worth of white frothy head. It sticks around long after the initial pour with about a fingers-worth on top of the body of the beer acting as the cap. There's some sticky white lacing along the sides of the glass after a quick swirl. A very nice looking beer.  S - Classic funky sweetness, pineapples, cloves, yeast, other tropical fruits. Reminds me a bit of a Hefe in some ways but a little more yeasty and some more malty sweetness.  T - Yeasty funk, slightly bitter, a nice malty finish that's slightly sweet yet also slightly bitter...hmm. Seems like it should be so straight forward on the palate, but it really isn't at all. The 8.5% is hidden really really well, very impressive.  M - Light to medium bodied, smooth and crisp, dry finish.  D - A wonderful beer that tricks you into thinking it's straight forward and dull but in reality, it's complex and wonderful. The alcohol is hidden so well that there's no way I'd guess it's 8.5%.

222,695,antoines15,4,"poured the cute little bottle into my newly acquired tulip glass. (thumbs up)  A: awesome ""collar"" on this beer. Two finger head that lingers for a decent amount of time. The glass was cleaned using the same stuff bars use to clean their glasses and it will never see dish soap. Awesome lacing as well on the glass.  S: smells kinda sweet but also like a typical BMC lager almost.  T: nothing like a BMC lager. I don't really care for belgian strong pales but this one is of a different breed. I'm not good at picking out what I taste, but I do know that I like this.  M: seems pretty carbonated and is just a very pleasing beer. I can see why it is so highly regarded.

222,695,ugaterrapin,4.33,"Poured into a St. Bernardus glass. A slow pour resulted in a two fingers worth of pristine pillowy white head. The head lingered for a while and left some impression lacing. The aroma is predominately a sweet sugary smell. There are some malts notes in the nose, but not much in terms of hops. The taste has a crisp balance. I was afraid of an overpowering sweetness, but it wasn't to be found. The light malt character, subtle hops on the finish, and perfect carbonation makes this a great Belgium beer.

222,695,Yoonisaykul,4.5,"This is one the first beers I bought at the SAQ long before the start of this BA life. Didn't like it much. Kind of felt there was something special but that stubby bottle was a chore. Had it a few more times with a better appreciation every time and I now think I'm ready to review it.  A- Very pale, hazy yellow. Like a cloudy, slightly watered down pineapple juice. Very nice creamy head. Lacing is a whole bunch of little groups spread evenly on the surface of my tulip. A second pour yeilded a head that once receded, left a thick shoelace looking strand all around the glass. Had never seen this and it's really cool. It's like I taped a thin cylindrical white rope all around the inner lip with some stalagtites dripping down from it. A nicer liquid and I'd award this a 5. The head is just so nice. Every time I swirl it a head nicer than most beers builds right back up.  S- Funky fermented pineapple juice. Other tropical fruit like passion and guava. Belgian yeast. Bubblegum. Gets better and better as it warms and loses some funk, releasing the tropical. After pouring again I noticed the head brings out most of the rubbery farty funk and the liquid holds all the delicious tropicalia. Alcohol comes up with the temp.  T- Powerful. Citrus. Soft citrus peel bitterness. Taste like many strong belgians but with a hop kick and just generally good. Alcohol is noticeable but if you like the taste enough you completely forget about it. Grain comes it towards the end of the swallowing sequence.  M- Very high carbonation. This one just wants to bust out of your mouth. Dry.  D- High. If I found this in a bigger format I'd buy it no problem.  Nothing incredible but definitely top-notch. This may be one of the times I'm not noticing just how good this is because it's so available.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,ReadyFireAim,4.88,"Purchased at local spirits shop in 330 mL bottle. As per the label's directions, chilled then poured into a wine glass (ordered my Duvel glass tonight).  Aroma: Sweet, pungent floral upfront, with some light spicy heat lingering in the background. They compliment each other nicely. Fantastic initial impression. 11/12  Appearance: Duvel has a unique characteristic, here: its incessant head retention. It's almost as if this beer is existing in a stasis -- the head on this guy just does NOT disappear. It's huge and billowy and cloud-white, with a mix of large and small effervescent bubbles. The beer itself is light-golden in color and quite clear. Exceptional appearance. 3/3  Flavor: Ah, the final arbiter of any beer is its flavor. Not to be outdone by appearance, the flavor kicks in as this beer slams your taste buds with a velvety hammer. Spicy phenols, laying-low hops, and pear-like notes are orchestrated by the sweet malty backbone on this one. One to sip and savor the complexity. Unique, memorable -- and most importantly -- delicious. More, please. 19/20  Mouthfeel: Very crisp and refreshing with the heat of the alcohol (nearly 9%!) being -- not masked -- layered nicely among its other characteristics. Light- to medium-bodied, slight astringency as the sweet creaminess snaps instantly to dry heat. Very complex. 5/5  Overall: Highly complex... what a wonderful experience. I couldn't really have more than two at a time, but man... what a treat. Lovin' it. 10/10  48/50 -- Deserves every bit of praise it gets as a world-class beer.

The beer itself is a light straw color with very visible carbonation.  Nose is very yeasty up front. Some banana, some cloves, a bit of red fruit, a lot of pepper on the back end.  Sweet apples is the first thing I taste, much sweeter than the nose. Some banana bread, with sweet malts and spices on the back end. Bright, light mouthfeel, and it would be easy to mistake this for a less strong beer. This helps the drinkability a great deal--I could happily have several and not realize what I'd done until I tried to stand up.  I never regret having one of these.

Smell is sour, with tones of malt that appear very much lager like.  First sip is light, with several complex flavors appearing up front in the pallet. Has the qualities of a very nice Pilsner, with the complexities of something much more mature.  In terms of Belgian Ales, this ranks right up with the best of them.

The head lingers for a very long time almost looking like a kruasen in a fermenter as it subsides. I smell some clodeves, apple, and banana in the head. There is a little yeast in there as well. The taste is a little sweeter than the smell with some earthy hop flavor as well. The mouthfeel is almost explosive at first with all that carbonation but afterwards it is smooth and goes down well.

222,695,feelmefoam,4.78,"Duvel pours the typical bright, clear yellow-gold color of many belgians, but the head, if possible, stands out from the rest. It is huge (3 inches high) white and fluffy as fresh snow, and has ridiculous retention time. The lacing is thick and foamy as well, and leaves no part of the glass untouched. The head is still here 5 minutes later, even after drinking, and I have it all over my nose.  Speaking of the nose, it's quite a thing to behold as well. Ripe apple, pear, and banana with some spicy yeast and buttery pilsner malt comprise the aroma, all melding together in a strong yet tame awesome aromatic adventure. Alliteration aside, this thing smells nice.  On the tongue, Duvel has elements similar to the nose like the ripe pears and apples, but a bit of citrus thrown in for good measure as well. Banana lingers in there too, accompanied by some buttery-cracker like malt flavor (the pilsner malts, according to the label), all backed up by some zesty, spicy yeast flavor and a bit of dry hoppiness. This beer is complex, flavorful, but mellow and extremely enjoyable.  If you need a second opinion, my roommate just walked in and took a sip, said ""That's the fucking SHIT!"" then walked out, only to return and steal more a few moments later. This beer is strangely addicting; I've never been the biggest fan of Belgians (I'd rather have a fresh American IPA), but this is by far and away my favorite and I can't put it down.  The mouthfeel is perfect. I know Miller High-Life claims it, but this is the real champagne of beers. Light, zesty carbonation over top of a buttery smooth medium bodied beer creates the perfect crisp and smooth drinking experience.  I've heard the hype. I have friends studying abroad in Belgium who drink this like its water, and now I know why. Belgians aren't my favorite type of beers, but this is the best of the Belgian Strong Pale Ale category and the best Belgian I've had period. Truly complex and packed with tons of flavor and good-looks, this beer remains so drinkable that I'm almost done with the bomber after pouring it only ~ten minutes ago. The only downside is the alcohol, which I'm starting to feel. Still, this is the highest rating I've given out to a beer to date, and it blows my mind that it goes to a Belgian. But Duvel certainly deserves it.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Great lacing; one of the most appealing brews visually, especially when poured into its own glassware.  The nose on a Duvel is fantastic: sweet malt, pine, and fruit up front with a back end of honey and bit of mustiness. It's a gorgeous, very bright and crisp nose. And the taste is just as solid -- the benchmark Belgian pale, all birght citrus up front with strong hints of pine and spices on the end; a very very clean, smooth, and bright taste that manages to be light and strong at the same time.  8.5 alcohol, but you wouldn't know it -- the mouthfeel is a bit thin and too bubbly for me, but it makes the brew easier to drink.

Seriously, the head doesn't really go away, it just cotton-candies its way down leaving huge sticks of chunk.  Big fruity, estery, dry aroma during the pour. Dry yeast, crackers, hay, pale pilsen malt, crisp earthy hops, green apple.  So crisp and dry on the palette, no residuals at all. This is famous for its incredible attenuation, and it shows in the pure and clean flavor profile. Lots of bright light fruits, dry yeast, earthy-spicy hops, pilsen malt, fresh cut hay, green apple peal, bananas.  Light bodied and briskly carbonated, it belies it's big malt bill with a great dryness.  This is a beer that can fool the masses. Easy to drink, tasty, and inoffensive, this is the quintessential everybody beer. Only one other big beer (Aventinus) has the same type of mass appeal to those who are typically scared of beer that you can taste.

222,695,JohnL9013,4.36,"A: This beer pours the most impressive, gigantic head I've ever seen, period. There isn't so much rings of lacing as much as a solid column of foam that coats absolutely everything. Bubbles rise within the beer, which is a hazy pale yellow. The appearance of this beer is second to none in terms of the head.  S: Not crazy in the smell department, but very balanced. Pleasant hop aroma with sweet malts.  T: The guys at Duvel are right when they tell you to let it warm up a tad before drinking it as this will actually make the flavor more balanced and smoother. Overall, this is certainly the cleanest beer I've ever had. The quality of the taste is absolutely phenomenal, and the freshness due to superb bottle conditioning (and likely addition of preservatives) is astounding, frankly, and the balance between sweetness (prominent), hops (slightly above average), and bitterness (low) makes this beer remind me of American IPA's, although this beer still stands alone. Very pleasant, mild, and balanced considering the abv. What is surprising is that the alcohol content is so high, in fact, you will not be able to taste it!  M: Superb mouthfeel. The carbonation is very fine and rolling this around in your mouth is very pleasing.  D: Drinkable to the extreme...just wish I had more than this 330 mL bottle!  I have mixed feelings on this beer due to the horrendous $6 I paid for its measly 330 mL. What is there is top-notch. Mouthfeel, drinkability, appearance, perfect...but the taste isn't as big as the pricetag suggests, though I hate to admit it, but now I can finally understand why people go crazy over this stuff.  edit: I am re-reviewing after tasting a second, far more impressive bottle.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Sparkling crisp, clear golden color with a huge, rocky, white head that doesn't go away and leaves beautiful rings of lace.  Aroma is one of clean, toasty, biscuity malt sweetness with some apple and yeast.  Flavor is moderately spicy with the yeast and soft, smooth malts contrasted with hop bitterness. Some alcohol warmth towards the end. This beer sucks you in and leaves you yearning for more.  Mouthfeel is crisp and clean, thanks to the generous carbonation.

Produced huge head that lingered for a long time. Light golden color, great lacing.  Smells initially of cakelike yeast and some citrus and hint of banana.  Incredible taste, some hops, some malt, plenty of bready yeast flavor. This is my first Duvel and was not at all disappointed.

Smells very ""Belgian"".  Tastes like it smells. A slight alcohol presence.  A surprisingly light body for such a murky looking beer. There was a lot of carbonation. Drink up before the carbonation disappears.  A good Belgian beer. Reminds me of Golden Monkey without the hints of mandarin oranges.

222,695,HitokiriNate85,4.06,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle.  A - Golden and pale yellow with the nicest head in all of beerdom. Great clarity. Honestly, I've seen it matched by a couple other Belgians, but this is basically the best looking beer ever. Carbonation not only comes from all over the glass, but shoots up in an intense stream from the laser etching at the bottom of the Duvel glass.  S - Pale, grainy malt is dominant. Light, musky, slightly lemony hops are there, joined by spicy notes from the yeast, along with some green apple.  T - The malt is upfront, with lots of lively spicy, lightly peppery notes. There's some fruitiness as well, though it's less discernible than in the aroma. The hops contribute an underlying, slightly musky herbal bitterness that really seems to cling, despite the carbonation.  MF - The insane amount of carbonation makes this the most lively beer I've ever had. It just exploding across the tongue with each sip. It gives the impression of a nice, light body. It's just really fun to drink.  D - While the carbonation makes this great to look at and fun to drink, it also makes it pretty filling. Given that, one is enough; I'd prefer less carbonation if I wanted a second. At the same time, the alcohol is incredibly well hidden in flavor, and the light mouthfeel just reinforces it.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

There is also some alcohol in the end but not in a bad way.  M : Very enjoyable, Some carbonation, the foam that stays on top adds something else.

Color is golden, crisp and vibrantly yellow, almost flourescent - pour SLOWLY (as directed).  Nose - hoppy, crisp with a very nutty undertone. Smells like spring time in Eastern Pennsylvania.  Taste - a dull malty start leads to a cocophony of strong citrus, mineral and organic flavors. Notes of parsely, coriander and lemon rind fill out a palate worthy of the most finely tuned taste buds. This beer could make even the most timid bow down and say uncle...Impressive is the only word that comes to mind. There is a reason this was on the top shelf, in the back, hidden behind the rest...someone was out in their car scratching together change to get it.  Mouth - smoothe and biting, a great summer beer.

A damn good piece of Belgian brewing construction. Duvel is an excellent ""gateway"" beer for people starting out in good beer . It resembles a Pils in appereance , so novice beer drinkers are at ease with it. When presented in its legendry tulip ,how could you say no?. It looks fantastic. Big foamy top ,above glowing yellow base. The aroma is estery ,with banana , apple and pear . Citrusy noble hops,with some pepper corn vibez. Drinking this is damn refreshing and dangerously fun.

Glug glug glug  The taste is fruity, reminding me of bananas and fresh red apple in addition to a spicy blend of flavors that adds a bit of heat to this. That flavor may also be the yeast, which also adds a kind of bread like funk to the whole thing...something like sourdough. Also I'm reminded of raspberries for some reason.

It is of white color and leaves blankets of thick lacing. I have never seen one centimeter lacing before this beer. Smell is mostly Belgian yeast and breadiness to me. A good amount of citrus, probably from hops comes through in the nose also. The standard dark fruits gets into the mix too. Taste is a great balance of flavors. I get a lot of yeast/breadiness. The dark fruit and belgian typical spices are nice. There is a citrus peel hoppy bitterness aspect that I really like. These are greatly balanced to almost perfection. A really nice laid-back belgian strong pale. Moderate body and carbonation suit the flavor balance well. The beer coats the tongue with the citrus peel bitterness. A tiny bit of warmth feels good also. I could session this and the 8.5% ABV is hidden amazingly. This is definitely one of the better Belgian beers I have had. The price is a bit much for me right now but I understand why it is that way.

One of my favorite aspects of this is the appearance of the beer, which isn't at all indicative of the flavors contained therein. Tasting provides flavors of Belgian pilsner malt, the Saaz hops, and the unique tart/pear-like flavor that comes from the yeast strain used. Just a hint of alcohol lets you know that this is a serious beer, but is so well blended that it is hardly noticeable. Completely refreshing, could be had at any time of the year.

The smell might be the best part of this beer. I was smelling it forever trying to find out what fruit smells i could decipher and after a while i decided that it smells like apples and strawberries. Maybe even like pears and bananas at the end? There is also that Belgian bitter yeast smell floating around in there, mmh! I love this beer way too much.  The taste is just beyond words. It is a strong beer and alcohol is evident in every sip. The malts definitely take the back seat in this beer, but hey that is completely fine. Its not like you cant taste the delicious pilsner malts, they just complement the hops and the yeast perfectly. The beer is perfectly hoped, not so much that it outshines the yeast, but not so little that you cant taste them. The only way that i can describe what this beer does to my taste buds is that it gives them multiple orgasms. Its perfect in every way!  The beer is pretty carbonated, i would compare it to champagne after it has been sitting out for a little while. You just never want this beer to leave your mouth... ever.

Lots of ripe green apple and yeasty tang and lemon juice and airy pilsner malt and band-aids. Everything is complimentary; each aroma builds upon what came before. There really isn't a lot more to say about the aroma and flavor besides that. Duvel is the quintessential Belgian Pale because of this incredible ability to be complimentary and whole in execution.  Duvel is super-carbonated which makes for one of the more sharp, prickly beers you will come across. The beer is very drying as well and the feel is definitely a large part of what makes the dry quality happen.

The taste is sweet, candid sugar and raisins, balanced sour notes from lemon, lime and some vinegar. Spices like clove and ginger is also there.  Rather much carbonation and a refreshing feeling.  A very rewarding beer, especially with cheese.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,richmof,3.08,"A commercial strong ale, with toe cheese on the nose and unrefined alcohol in the mouth. The alcohol dominates across the palatte, which is quite a feat, given it is only 8.5%.  I note this beer is currently 59th on the overall beerlist for BA, and 5th out of all the Belgian beers, and I just find that to be divorced from reality. I doubt it would make it into my top 59 for Belgium!  When I think of all the beers I know that are behind this on BA ratings list, it pains me.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,jbowers56,4.25,"Great looking beer. Huge white pillowy head sits atop a fine clear colden yellow brew. Plenty of lacing already from the head as it slowly fades.  Aroma is complex. Sweet malts are there. Spicy pepper like smells and also some banana like esters. Having not had this for a long time, I am most excited to taste this one!  Crisper and cleaner on the palate than i expected. Finishes dry and spicy. Yeast characters are interesting, more so once I poured the rest of the bottle in to get the yeast from the bottom. Same esters are present as in the nose. To be honest, I was hoping for more richness from the malt as was suggested by the nose.  Very strong prickly carbonation dominates the mouthfeel. Despite this, a very smooth beer.  Way too easy to go back for more.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Lots of bubbles. Lots!  Smell. Strong yeast, bread, biscutty smell.  taste... well.. I could tell this was good quality stuff but I just do not like this type of beer I guess. Very yeasty and just not pleasant to drink. I did not like it. I guess I just don't like this type.  Very strong beer so be careful!!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Poured nice and cold from the bottle into the big tulip glass this one shows a clear gold color with a one finger unshakeable white head and very good lace. The aroma is fruity clove and bright citrus bread. The first mouthful gives a mid-plus bodied and smooth feel with lots of lively carbonation. The tastebuds detect banana and sweet melon, clove and anisette. Full, sweet, and pretty drinkable. A more than pleasant experience that I want to repeat!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,mike130,4.68,"What a beer. Poured into (sadly) a pint glass (I haven't gotten around to buying a tulip/big snifter yet). Absolutely colossal, creamy-looking head. Lots of retention, leaves a little ""mountain"" of foam in the middle with loads of lacing all around the glass. Loads and loads of bubbles coming up constantly from the bottom of the glass, this really is one of the best looking beers out there. If there's a single thing the Belgians are unparalleled on, it's good head, and this beer shows it.  Smells very nice - loads of estery aromas, banana, a bit of spiciness, a touch of hops. Quite yeasty, sort of like a less sweet hefe with a touch of hops. No trace of alcohol.  The taste is much like the flavor - banana, sweet, not as yeasty as would be expected but still there's a yeast flavor to be found. A nice touch of hops near the end, and you have one of the best beers in its style. Very, very tasty and extremely well balanced. Can tell it's strong but there is not a distinctly alcohol taste as in some other brews.  Mouthfeel is good - quite carbonated, leaves a dry sort of feel on your mouth afterwards.  Very easy drinker - could pop down a sixer of this if it wasn't so damn alcoholic - no point on wasting this by drinking while not sober enough to enjoy it. All in all, probably one of the best beers in the world and most likely its style. Despite it being widely available, it does not disappoint. Top notch beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,longbongsilver,3.73,"Having had Belgian style ale in the past, figured the time was right to go O.G. with it. Pours a highly translucent white-yellow w/ the weirdest head I've ever seen (looks like it floats IN the beer after pulling from the glass). Get an unexpected whiff that reminds me of lemon (and little else) before the first swig.  Kinda sweet, despite the smell. Barely any carbonation, very little malt in the background, don't taste the alcohol at all. Very subtle.  To me it's a ridiculously deceptive chillout brew: pop open the stubby size bottles and next thing you know you've lost count. While it definitely does the job, I expected more of an edge.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,kreeper,4.2,"Absolutely beautiful beer. Hazy, golden yellow with a classic dense thick white head. A full inch and a quarter over the rim of the glass without any spill. Duvel has a very pronounced, fruity aroma, lemons and pears. The first bottle I had, I did not realize that there was some yeast in the bottle (although I love the yeast). The beer is very refreshing, and very fruity. Somewhat dry finish, very pleasant.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,FickleBeast,4.41,"Poured into a Duyvel tulip.  Wow. The Duvel glass contains this beer perfectly, with three full fingers of foam billowing up to the top of the glass. It takes several minutes to dissipate, clinging to the glass as it recedes. The nucleation point at the bottom of the glass creates a near volcano of bubbles that rush to the surface. This beer looks absolutely perfect.  Aroma is dominated by a spicy belgian yeast - phenols, bubblegum, some banana.  This beer tastes crisp and clean. The yeast flavor is not as potent as the smell would indicate - a trait that I enjoy. There is a strong pale malt backbone, that expertly disguises the 8.5% ABV.  Mouthfeel is effervescent, cry, crisp and clean. Very pleasant. Drinkability scores high as well... this beer just goes down easy and hits the spot.  I really didn't think I liked Belgian style beers... this beer is certainly causing me to rethink that position!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,ericj551,4.68,"Duvel pours a very slightly hazy light golden yellow with a thick, fluffy head that sticks around. The aroma is sweet pale malt with tons of fruity esters, maybe some pear. The flavor is crisp, the fruitiness alludes to sweetness, but the beer finishes dry. Tons of flavors from the yeast. There is some bitterness in the finish, but it is just enough to balance the light, fruity malt. A bit of herbal hop flavor lingers in the smooth finish.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,billab914,4.23,"Poured from a 375ml bottle into a Rochefort chalice. Poured a cloudy light golden color with a fluffy white head covering the top. The head was long lasting and left excellent lacing on the glass as I drank it.  The aroma is dominated by the fruity, spicy Belgian yeast. It has some hints of apple, hops and a little alcohol coming through. The taste is also not surprisingly strong with the Belgian yeast flavors. It has a light, crisp, fruity flavor that is very nice.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a little above average carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's a very good tasting and easy drinking beer. Overall an excellent example of it's style and a delicious beer at that.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,PDXHops,4.68,"750 ml bottle, poured into the signature Duvel tulip, which also doubles as my favorite glass in general.  On a 1-5 scale, this is the only beer I can think of that deserves a 6. A careful pour according to the label's direction yields a massive 4-finger bright white foamy head that slowly reduces into an alternately smooth and lumpy cap that refuses to go anywhere. Gorgeous clumps of lace all the way from top to bottom. A tornado of bubbles up the middle of the glass continuously feeds the head.  Bursting with clean, fresh aromas. Tangy fresh sliced apples, a squeeze of lemon, lightly yeasty, mildly spicy, extremely appetizing.  Big hop bitterness up front that yields to a lively fruitiness that is a bit juicy at first, then becomes lightly sweet and dry at the same time, a la a brut champagne. A big burst of clean yeast. A bit of clove, some phenols. Warming alcohol toward the swallow. So much going on- wonderful stuff.  Moutheel is very interesting, as it somehow manages to be vigorously carbonated with tiny bubbles, yet very creamy at the same time. After a last burst of bitterness at the swallow, it finishes rather crisp and clean, practically begging you to take another sip.  Overall impression: Incredible beer, and one of my absolute favorites. Every beer drinker needs to give Duvel a try.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,ChadQuest,4.31,"A:Wow, pours a huge explosive head, this one requires a very gentle pour. It's bone white and the lacing is as sticky as frosting on the side of the glass. Its pretty and a tad hazy golden in color. This is one of those beers where the appearance is so beautiful to me, visual perfection.  S&T: Yeast, Clove,, citrus, and some light green apple notes with that hint of tartness/dryness,and light and crisp hops, like a nice pilsner.  M: very fine carbination, as everyone says like champaign,and a very nice slighty dry finish that leaves a touch of yeasty notes.  D: For being a lighter color and full flavor, and having 8.5%, i could drink this any night, and i bet i could even get some of my BMC friends totally into this beer and start their conversion!  I have had this beer twice before and was honestly never impressed,never got the hype. but this time i was majorly wowed, big time. Glad i gave the Devil another chance!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Pour slow so you don't get too much head. Head will form and stay on it's own. Beautiful light golden yellow with a beautiful head that lends sticky lace all the way down the glass.  Aroma is a little too yeasty. There is really nothing else going on. Just yeast.  Taste is wonderful. Very light crisp and refreshing considering the ABV. Very good hop flavor and Belgian yeastiness. Very tasty.  Mouthfeel is perfect. Nice thin bubbles.  Overall one of the best beers you will drink and so easily attainable.

Pours a golden yellow with big fluffy white head that lingers long in the glass. I initially get some pear or apple in the nose, but also a yeasty alcohol lingers. Slightest hint of hoppy bitterness, but overall this is a smooth and light bodied beaut. Hints of malt and alcohol, but finishes with a bit of citrus fruit. Everything balances quite well, not overly bitter, or fruity, etc - just a nice enjoyable drink.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Beergeeknut,4.5,Appearance: Out of a 750ml corked bottle poured into a Duvel Green tulip. The color is nicely golden with a thick frothy head. The head retention from this one is amazing the lacing left behind coats the glass.  Aroma: Sweet apple faintness of floral hoppiness. Not too much from the malts but alcohol notes. There is a faint dryness in the nose.  Taste: A relatively smooth moutfeel. A floral hoppiness a slight dryness. Apple notes along with alcohol.  Notes: This is a very clean beer.

222,695,FreshHawk,4.88,"A - Hazy lemon, orange color. Large billowing, white foamy, sticky head that lasts for quite a while with good amount of lacing remaining.  S - A lot of golden fruit and citrus aroma. Peach, orange, and lemon are strong along with some spice (coriander). Apple, spicy yeast, and floral smell.  T - Good amount of fairly sweet golden fruit and malt. Cut a bit by some citrus (lemon) as well as some spice (clove, coriander, pepper). Alcohol is somewhat present and warming, but pretty well hidden for how light and crisp it is. Starts somewhat sweet, then becomes really juicy and fruity, then finishing slightly tart and spiced.  M - Medium to light body with very good carbonation. Quite crisp and juicy.  D - Very drinkable. Doesn't weigh heavy on the palate and very refreshing with a good amount of fruit, but it isn't a really fruity beer, nor is it too sweet, just really refreshing.  Notes: Really nice beer. It has a number of flavors, at times it reminds me of a really good pilsner, at other times a good Kölsch, and at others a light tripel. Just a very refreshing, easy to drink, and tasty beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Surprised at how transparent it was considering its bottle conditioned.  Smells of yeasty spiciness and a bit of sweetness. Wasn't picking up much of anything interesting or out of the ordinary really. Slight hop aroma in there as well.  Taste and mouthfeel were almost akin to champagne at times, sweet and on the drier side of things. Highly carbonated with lots of bubbles that bombarded the tongue adding some acidity, but not in a bad way. Move over High-Life.  Very balanced. There's a slight warm alcohol splash somewhere in the middle of each sip, but its kicked off the palate quickly with some hop bitterness and more of that yeasty spiciness. Almost too drinkable for a beer of this ABV.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,TCgoalie,4.46,"Pours a crisp golden yellow with a huge head and a lot of bubbles. Fun.  There's essence of apples, honey, and some alcohol esters in the smell.  The first thing I notice in the taste is the spiciness...it is almost peppery. There is also a slightly sour taste that is like a mix of candy apples and lemon peel right after the spice.  The swallow leaves a bit of a dry finish. There is definitely a lot of carbonation happening in the mouth.  A very easy drinker for the high alcohol content. This is a very exciting and intriguing drink.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

S: Clove spice, hop, belgian yeast, funk, some biscuity malt aromas, a little alcohol and some fruity esters. Lots to appreciate in this aromatic beer.  T: The beer is very fruity to start and has sweet biscuity malt flavor up front also. There is a little bit of clove or coriander spice. Then the peppery alcohol warmth and hop flavors kick in along with the yeast funkiness. The finish is on the bitter side with the hop, clove, and peppery alcohol still on the tongue as the mouth dries.  M: very spicy and highly carbonated. Leaves the mouth semi-dry. Very refreshing for such a strong beer.  D: One of the best. Delicious, looks great, smells awesome, can drink a ton of it.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

The first time I tried this beer, I thought it was good, but not mind blowing. I continued to read reviews of this beer and they were all sterling. So I figured maybe I got an old batch of beer or something. Tried it again last night and I think the beer is a good beer, but it is not the holy grail of beer that many make it out to be.

222,695,Pahn,4.83,"330ml bottle into Duvel tulip. Best by date: July 2012.  Appearance: Careful pour yields a one inch fizzy and pillowy white head (which crackles audibly). Color is translucent golden yellow with numerous bubbles rising up in the middle. Both the head and the beer leave a lot of bubbly lacing all over the glass.  Smell: Apple, Belgian yeast, and a bit of funk. The smell grows and changes as the beer warms and the smell interacts with the flavor (apple drops off, replaced by other fruits); I get notes of lemon, green grapes, banana, etc. Big, pleasing Belgian yeast smell doesn't let up.  Taste: First sip is an explosion of sweet and subtle esters giving way to a strong, funky Belgian yeastiness and a crisp, clean finish. On the next, a stinging tartness emerges and transforms into a smooth banana note. The tartness is mildly lemony, and a little soapy. It sticks around along with the yeast as a dominant and constant aspect of the flavor. Alcohol warmth gradually present at the end. The taste up front is various esters; banana, plum, berries, etc, always sweet but not candy sweet. The lightly sweet fruits develop and change, but are always there; they're never dominated away by bitterness or tartness, even though they're different with each sip. Aftertaste is like fresh white bread/potato bread.  The complexity of a great quad with lighter flavors. One of those rare beers the depth of whose taste can't be plumbed before the glass is empty.  Mouthfeel: Juicy and creamy, with lots of carbonation. Eventually starts to finish a bit warm. Body is light but not thin, if that makes sense; the carbonation and creaminess give it a lot of substance, but it's still very light and smooth.  Drinkability: If I could only choose 10 beers to drink for the rest of my life (maybe even 5), this would be on the list without a second thought.  Duvel is a classic beer. I've loved it for years, having tried it early on in my foray into craft beer. No matter how much my palate develops, Duvel keeps delivering new and delicious flavors with every sip. World class.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Dijeriduster,4.11,"A- What can be said that hasn't before? Beautiful clear beer with tons of head. Love the glass too - well worth having as part of the collection  S- Quite pilnery ie lots of yeasty smells with an undertone of sour lager.  T - Wonderfully clear palate on the first sip. Some phenolic tastes in the middle, but subtle and appropriate somehow. As it warms you get a little more of the malt character - it would make sense that the pale is steamed to add to even more colour.  M - Lots of carb present lending an ease - but this is deceptively full. Just look at how the head never leaves! Exceptional mouthfeel  D - High. Great cross over for the Bud drinker who doesn't think beer can be anything else. This is a winner for sure.

Lots of lacing and perpetual bubbling throughout. If I didn't think that some chemical was causing the head retention this would doubtlessly be a five.  S - Not too much here, a little bland. Strong yeast character, with a bit of spice and perhaps hints of lemon and banana. Definitely yeast forward, if detrimentally so.  T - Again, very yeast forward. Some wheat and citrus notes, but definitely a yeast-centered brew. A sort of weird, phenolic aftertaste at first, but that goes away some the farther you get in.

The aroma is that of a mild Pilsner. Hay, flowers, grass; a suggestion of sweetness. The seemingly benign appearance and aroma portray it as just another soft, delicate, inviting beer. What a con, Devil indeed.  Toasted malt, a touch of malt sweetness, flowers, pear, apple skin, and pepper. Yeast, hop bitterness and alcohol on the finish. A perfect balance of sweet, tart, and spiced flavors.  Bone dry, crisp, smooth. This devilish beer demands that you take a sip and then another and another...

It's light and lager-ish, but with a great balance of carbonation and a good alcohol taste as well. Surprisingly good.  M: The light, airy tastes are complemented by the fizzy, thin mouthfeel.

222,695,obywan59,4.63,"330ml stubby.  I'd been eyeing the Duvel gift boxes for a month. Finally, last week I decided to snag the last one. I'm sure it must have been marked down, as the gift box was only a buck-fifty more than the Duvel stubby 4-pack. So now I have the famous Duvel glass--awesome!  Not being able to read the fine print on the label, I gave it my normal hard pour and ended up with 2 fingers of brew and a chunky, foamy-white head towering over the copious tulip glass. It took a few minutes, but I was soon able to get the rest of the beer in the glass. Easilly one of the most glorious heads ever. The golden ""Duvel"" lettering backed by the white head matched almost perfectly the color of the brew. The beer itself was tramslucent and light gold in color. As it receded, patches of foamy white lacing adorned the glass and a lump of foam (it looked like a Duvel float) rested on the brew being fed by a smoky tower of bubbles. One of the coolest looking beers ever.  A bit horsey from the Belgian yeast. Lemony. Peppery. A little apple. One single whiff of peppery watercress. Some sweet malt as well.  Some light lemony sweetness in the taste with a decently bitter finish.  Great mouthfeel. Somewhat drying with a light tingling on the tongue from the carbonation. Some burn from the alcohol which continues as a warming in the throat.  Quite easy to drink for a Belgian. Nicely warming for the winter, yet light enough to be a good summer brew. Two stubbys and I'm feeling good.  It's really hard for me not to pour all my beer knto the glass, but someday, I'll sample this again, and try to leave the yeast in the bottle.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Very fresh smelling in my opinion.  T- Light grapes and banana has a strange light boozy hoppyness. Aftertaste is kind of bitter and sticks on the tongue for a long time.  M- Goes down smooth but you can tell there is tons of carbonation going in with it. Whats really scary is it doesn't seem to make you burp much to begin with but you can feel the pressure building up. This one would give you a stomach ache if you didn't belch often enough.  D- Well I am a novice when it comes to golden ales of this caliber and I would say I enjoyed drinking this brew but I think it could of done better masking the 8.5% ABV.

A: Pours a clear gold with a GIANT fluffy head. That's about as big as it gets. Some great, sticky lacing covers the sides of the glass. The tiny carbonation bubbles are racing from the bottom of the glass upward as if to say ""I can't wait to get in your mouth!"" Don't worry, tiny bubbles, you soon will.  S: Yeasty, fruity freshness with a bit of a peppery spice thrown in there for good measure. Just a great, crisp bouquet. There is some sort of poetic juxtaposition between how crisp and clean the smell is and how clumpy and sticky the head is. I'll let the scholars figure that one out. This is an intriguing beer to be sure. Let's drink some.  T: Wow. That has a lot going on. I can really taste each component ingredient in clear waves. First, the bready yeast takes center stage, followed by the sweet, fruity pale malts, then finished off by the dry, spicy hops. I really appreciate how well-crafted this is.  M: Very enjoyable. A nice, crisp feel that starts medium-robust and bready and ends very dry and clean.  D: Excellent, based on the overall lightness of the mouthfeel, the full flavor, and the clean finish. I could certainly have a couple of these. The abv is sneaky, though. I certainly felt the 8.5% by the end of my tasting.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,matt20102,4.92,"What else is there to say about Duvel? It's just about the most perfect beer on the market. It pours with an instantaneous, thick white head over a golden body. The aroma is distinct and smells of flowers, wheat and subtle hops; the flavor is smooth with notes of wheat, honey, and hops. The overriding distinction of this beer, though, is that there is no way to tell that it is 8.5% until you've finished the bottle! It is warming, smooth, pleasurable beer that I will enjoy again!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,herman77,4.34,"White creamy head that is about an inch thick. Great head retention. I only gave it a 3.5 for smell since I can't really pick up any smell other then faint malty sweetness/bitterness. I probably should have let this one warm up a little more before pouring it. Taste is bitter and a little sweet at the same time. The finish has a sort of dryness effect at the end. A little on the carbonated side as well. Awesome drinkability. I could drink this stuff all the time. I can't believe the ABV is 8.5%. You will never be able to tell its this strong. Tastes like it should be 5%.  One of the best visually appealing ales I have ever seen/drank. This is the last of my 4 pack and the first time I have tried it before. It is a little spendy for what it is in my opinion. A must try if you have not have it before. Worthy of the hype I have heard. Possibly a perfect ""beer"" for a non beer connoisseur.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Hopfist,4.38,"Clean, crisp, golden, boozy, awesome. Everyone's going to rant and rave about how good it is, so my accolades won't add anything here. Instead I'll play the role of the French judge at every olympic contest. The ethanol profile is a tad like nail polish remover. The malt profile is a bit boring. But all in all, impossible to argue against it's being a contender for the podium.

Appearance: Pours a hazey golden color with champagne like suds. The head retention is there along with some artistic lines on the glass. Lacing, oh yeah.  Smell: The nose is spice,hops and lemon. Very fesh aroma.  Taste: A bitter pepper taste with some funk in the backround. I'm picking up a hint of banana in there as well with hop bitterness rounding it out.  Mouthfeel: A crisp clean effervescent experience with a dry finish. A little too ambitious with the carbonation IMO.  Drinkability: I prefer it more during the summer time. The alcohol is well hidden. At 8.5% it definitely deserves a bit of caution.  I appreciate it as a refreshing beer during the summer months, but for me personally it's over carbonated. That being said, it's still a more than worthy interpretation of the style.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,AlexLMS,4.78,"Appearance: good clarity (no floating yeast) with a light golden colour. The head is white, huge, full and creamy. Excellent retention followed by lots of beautiful lacings. Aroma: very nice sweet malts aroma, spices and fruits (mainly citrus). Taste: confirms the aroma with sweet malts, spices, herbal hops, citrus and alcohol presence. Mouthfeel: smooth and creamy, high carbonation and a full body. Warming, well disguised high alcoholic strength. Finish: lingering mixture of sweet and bitter aftertaste.  Overall: fantastic beer. One of the top ten beers of the world.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,icetraxx,3.87,"A: The first two glasses I poured out of the bottle were crystal clear golden colors, the last looked more like a Witbier as it was slightly hazy from the bottle conditioning yeast. I had to pour slowly due to massive creamy head formation. The head fades in spots and doesn't in others, making it look like melted marshmallows are floating in the beer. This is by far the best lacing beer I've ever had. My empty glass is filled with tons of bubbling foam and lace, it looks like my glass was once filled with whipped cream. Amazing.  S: A bit of honey (due to the fact this Duvel was aged and the hops settled down and made a honey-like aroma), noble hops, sweet malty grain, and belgian yeast (little funk though). Unfortunately the aroma isn't very powerful, even with the higher ABV acting as a vehicle for aroma.  T: I originally thought this tasted too much like a Pilsner, but I have warmed up to it quite nicely by my second glass. There is a tinge of skunk in the particular bottle I am drinking, which really worried me, but it has settled down nicely with some decanting. This beer has a slightly sweet edge, but not too sweet. The sweetness is mildly balanced by hop bitterness, and a slightly spicy/yeasty element. The Belgian yeast is very conservative in this one, which is very disappointing. No tartness and no funk. Crisp, clean, and refined.  Complexity seems to be lacking, possibly due to age. Age has definitely added a honey-like edge, but the hop fruitiness seems to be completely lost. Drink this one fresher.  M: Super creamy for the light color. Mixing in the yeast even adds better mouthfeel.  D: Very easy to drink for the high ABV, yet I can't see myself having too many due to a lack of complexity.  O: I prefer the beer with the yeast mixed in. I have had Belgian-style brews that I have enjoyed quite a bit more for the money; this is a solid beer, even so, I have yet to be a fan of Belgian-style Pale Ales. Serve this one at a higher temperature (55 degrees F) in order to get the most flavor out of it as possible.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,MrHassellYaHurd,4.42,ETA: This is a review of a Duvel that I have been aging for a little over a year.  Pours into a Duvel glass a beautiful and slightly cloudy golden-yellow (yeast added) with the signature billowy Belgian head and tons of carbonation racing up the walls of the glass.  Smells of heavy malts and bakery fresh bread initially on the intake. Hints of sour green apple tartness as well as a gentle alcoholic sweetness.  I taste tons of fruitiness: green apples as well as lemon peels and grapefruit. A crisp cracker malty-graininess leads to a very champagne like lingering aftertaste carries the only hint of alcohol.  The duvel has a refreshingly light-medium velvet-like body with tremendous carbonation which in no small way make this a deceivingly drinkable big Belgian beer!,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,ktrillionaire,4.83,"As good as a beer can be, this one is...  A &#8211; Bold bright golden hue, with stratospheric, cumulus-cloud head, boulders of lacing. It is truly a beautiful thing.  S &#8211; The aroma is sublime; banana, apple and assorted ripe fruity esters, with a clean grainy malt, and lightly spicy, peppery hops.  T &#8211; It has such a bright, outstanding taste, in many ways quite similar to Champagne, both in its subtle complexity and its bright, effervescent body. I detect sweet and tart white grape, peach and apple, initially. It is followed by the hearty grain and lighty bitter hop flavors that are the hallmark of Euro lagers, while retaining the subtle fruity funk. Tart pear and slight alcohol round out the finish.  M &#8211; A large part of the experience; the sharpness of carbonation enhances and highlights the outstanding dynamics of the variously intertwined flavors.  D &#8211; This beer is a masterpiece.

Large fluff/foamy brilliant white head that didnt last all that long but looked great. Was hard for me to get the aroma, light fruit, grape? Tasted slight alchohol, white grapes, like a good champagne to me. Lots of carbonation and light feel that gets slighty heavier and warming and dry at the end. I tend to compare this too delirium tremens, very similar however crisper and less fruit flavor going on here. I feel like you could pour this as an alternative to a good champagne and most wouldnt know the difference. Definitely a drinkable beer but the ABV would keep me having only a few spaced out. Ill most likely get the proper duvel glassware and get this again.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,youngleo,3.68,Poured to a two fingered head that had lots of big bubbles. Head was white in color and brew itself was hazy golden. Not a lot of lacing going on. Very light smelling. Just a hint of alcohol and maybe some grain. Had a fruit taste. Maybe apples or pears. Also tasted slightly sweet. Good all around balance. Not bitter by any means. It didnt have any type of aftertaste at all. Felt good in the mouth. Carbonation was right. I think it would make a good session beer. But you would have to be carfull. Lots of alcohol. Ill buy again.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Groenebeor,4.08,"Poured from the larger bottle - like a champagne bottle. Purchased it for about eight bucks at the Cork and Barrel here in town. They have a great selection and was very pleased to see this there.  Appearance was good - a very illustrious golden color with a one finger white head. Very clear and this beer - believe it or not - glistens like jewels. Very pretty and appetizing.  Scent wise this beer doesn't offer much in my opinion. It has a gentle malt smell with a gentle hop smell. Not much at all.  This beer is super clear and super pure taste wise. The malts remind me of almonds in a way, very enjoyable with a no where near cloying sweetness. The hops give it a little edge that covers up the alcohol well.  It has a good mouthfeel due to its clearness and cleanness. Makes for a super drinkable beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Bisho,4.7,"Poured from a 750ml corked bottle into a Duvel tulip glass.  Very pale golden colour. Almost lager in appearance if you leave the yeast in the bottle. If you add the yeast, it becomes slightly cloudy. Massive foamy white head and the lacing clings to the glass.  Light spice, apple, pear and malt on the nose.  Exceptional flavor and super creamy in the mouth. Apples to the fore with lots of spice and pale malt. Lively carbonation and the alcohol is present on the finish.  Sometimes I like to add the yeast which masks the hops a little bit and brings the pale malt to the fore. So if you like it dry, train yourself to pour it leaving the yeast in the bottle. Best to let it settle for a few days before opening if you prefer it this way.  Could this be the best Belgian blonde/SPA on the planet?  A truly magnificent brew whatever way you like it!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,jesey,5,"This is a great beer. A truely great Belgium because it is not overly sweet like a lot of Belgiums are. It's balanced with nice grassy hops which produced a creamy mouthful and a dry finish. People who love the hoppy American ales but are turned off by the spicy, sugery Belgium ales will most likely find this truely enjoyable.  * Note if this beer is properly prepared, its color is very clear and not murky. You should have no problem seeing through your glass. So, let it sit for at least 3 days before drinking, and don't pour the yeast into your glass unless you know you like it. It makes a big difference on taste--much drier and smoother, and with a much more pronounced hop flavor without the yeasts floating around. I always let mine sit for a week so the yeasts are settled.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

There's about a 1.5 finger head that takes its sweet time falling, leaving behind a nice white grid of foam.  Smell: Strong clean malt shines through. Peppery background.  Taste: Smooth and crisp on the palate. Lively carbonation adds good zing and bite. Flavor hedges between sweet and bitter, eventually falling on the side of a sweet finish. The fruity malt esters are complemented by mild spice. Just a hint of pure alcohol flavor is present, especially at the finish.  Mouthfeel & Drinkability: It's just so crisp and clean.

222,695,Minotaur,4.46,"So many descriptions of Duvel are here, I don't think waxing on about the intense golden color laced with a powerful stream of bubbles, the HUGE white frothy head, the distinct bitter pils like aroma and taste laced with the sweetness of bready Belgian yeast will add significantly.  I will say that this beer is utterly unique. They say that Duvel has not exemplified a style, but helped define it. Somewhere between the crisp, refreshing bitterness of a Pils and a strong, sweet Belgian Ale.  This is not a beer that I reach for on a regular basis; but it is one of the most balanced and full-flavored Belgian Pales I have tasted.  The 750l bottle is far superior to the smaller bottles IMO; it has a more rounded and nuttier-bitter hops flavor.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Magpie14,4.53,"A: a fizzy clouded banana yellow color reigns throughout with golden straw and diluted orange highlights. Along with these wondrous colors a bone white frothed head is most impressive. The cap sat atop for some time and melted away slowly leaving incredible sheets and pockets of sticky lace. A huge look to this one  S: the nose holds sugary banana, pears, and tart apples. A mild spicy muskiness and dry fragrant hop whiff floats about as well  T: bright fruits move around the palate with sweet pears and tart lemons 'n' apples, with more of the latter two. A reasonable malty bread-like and yeast character is constant with a pinch of various spices both peppery and clove like. Hops fit within this spicy fold as well and come across grassy and pungent. Every sip is filled with a light sweetness of sugared candy and honey. As it warms things are enhancing nicely and becoming more and more hoppy and tart  M: for so many flavors the body is very light and airy. The body is loaded with carbonation and it refrains from being smooth or creamy. This is not a problem as the flavor experience is great. Alcohol peaks through  D: always a pleasure to drink and a must have, top notch drinkability. Great stuff!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

The body is a golden yellow with a very lively active body. Lots of carbonation (make sure your glass is completely clean otherwise you'll see which part you have missed!) The aroma was very pleasant with bread, light grains, and dough on the nose. Taste seems to follow the nose with additions of coriander and a light leafy after taste. I can see what the fuss is.

There is a lot going on. ( edit, 12-22-10. There is a lot of spice and pepper. )  T- Green apples, yeasty funk, wine, dark fruits, alcohol on the finish.

Smell was almost what I expect from a hefe. Banana and clove, but a touch more earthy notes. Also smelled a little of straw.  Taste was very complex, but extremely delicious. Clove and yeasty earthiness upfront with a very crisp finish. Bitterness of the hops complimented the earthy flavors perfectly. Also a slight pepperiness in there as well that adds to the flavor. Sweet warming alcohol makes itself known in the finish just enough.  Mouthfeel and drinkability were almost perfect. It left a slightly fizzy feeling as it coated the palate.

Crazy bubbles from bottom of the glass seem never ending. Clarity seems to cloud up as time passes, insane amount of lacing is left all around the inside of the glass. Truly one of the better looking ales available. Very unique in its own right. Smells of alcohol and a yeasty, subtle malt character. Tastes of nice malt, sweetness in the middle, followed by warming from the alcohol, which is hidden so well you might not even know that it is there. Has a dry finish. Refreshing taste, to say the least. Feels great, lively carbonation and a smooth, slick feel make this a deceptively easy brew to drink.

The look is golden clear. It is the piss of the gods!  The smell is almost floral with a plant greenest about it.  The taste is exquisite with a subtle sweetness upfront followed by a clean resolve with no off flavors.  The carbonation holds up extremely well (almost oddly) considering the strength of the beer.

222,695,epicness,4.71,"A - Can you say gunshot sounding when the cork is popped? Holy crap that was loud. I poured it unhurried just like they suggest. The beer is pale yellow. The bubbles are rising.. and never-ending. Pretty cool to watch this upside down waterfall. The head is gigantic. 3-4 fingers, and fluffy as a pillow. Lace is just stuck all over the glass. This is probably the best looking beer I have ever seen.  S - Powerful yeasty aroma with a slap in the face of hops and citrus. That's the best way for me to describe it. More specifically it smells like lemon, not orange. Has a flower like smell to it. It's nice.  T - The taste is like no beer I have ever tasted before. It's actually going to be kind of hard to describe. It's actually a little spicy, almost kind of peppery. Once you get past to that it hits you with the citrus. Coriander and lemon. The hop smell is barely traceable in the taste, in my opinion. It's got a real dry smooth finish to it, and the aftertaste is barely noticeable. The alcohol isn't disgustingly high, but at 8.5%, I figured I'd get at least a taste of it. I'm glad I'm not. I like it much better this way.  M -Very crisp, and super carbonated. It's almost like a champagne on the tongue, it's so bubbly. Like I said before, the finish is pretty dry, smooth, and refreshing all at the same time. All that complicated stuff aside, surprisingly, it's light bodied which brings me to the next category of drinkability.  D - Due to it being low bodied and just amazing, makes this an ideal drinkable beer. It's so drinkable that I would say it's borderline dangerous because of the alcohol level. I'd definitely advise to try to take it easy, although you can definitely get caught up drinking a few of these.

The citrus hops make this incredible.  Drinkability: I could drink these all day long, and would love it. Probably one of the highest drinkable beers I've had.

222,695,BeerFMAndy,5,"11.2 oz bottle poured into a Duvel tulip. 8.5% ABV, Best Before 07 2012. Thanks to my girlfriend for a GOOD bottle of this. I've been trying to review it for damn near a year and have been getting only crap bottles.  A - The pour, unhurried, like they suggest, leaves the beer a crystal clear pale yellow so the drinker can witness the never-ending chimneys of carbonation billowing bubbles upwards. The bleached white head is three fingers tall and filled with dense, creamy bubbles. Solid retention finally gave way to characteristic Belgian lace all over the glass like a beautiful veil.  S - The Belgian yeast creates a strong, perfumy aroma of yeast and mild spices with a touch of citrus in the nose. Saaz hops (I believe) add a little spice as well as giving off a floral scent and making it a nice crisp, clean aroma. Pale malts fall into the background but still have a touch of raw honey sweetness to them. Or perhaps there is a little candi sugar. Lots of nuanced in this intoxicating aroma.  T - Spicy all over the place. Black pepper and a...coriander-like hint coming from either the yeast or the hops. The hops give a delicate dryness to the finish which pairs well with the citrusy zest. The Belgian yeast, without sediment present, still gives a yeast flavor with light esters. Low sweetness poking through. Delicate but very deep.  M - Crisp and abundantly carbonated, it's as sprtizy on the tongue as champagne. The finish has a light dry and citrus kick that gives it a refreshing feel. It feels light bodied.  D - Insanely drinkable for the percent it contains making it a dangerous brew. I could have a few in a row. Fantastic flavor and feel, it is THE perfect example of the style and one of the greatest beers of all time when you don't constantly get skunked or bad bottles. Shoulda' had this at midnight instead of champagne.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,StevenBilodeau,3.73,"This is an exceptional beer. It has a nice pale golden hue, that has a seductive glow when put to a light. Duvel has a very nice head, that is just as impressive as its color. The head doesn't stay too long, or too short. Nice lacing occurs, and leaves behind a spiraling foam covered glass edges. A taste of hops, strong flavor, with notes of citrus. The citrus element helps to create a smooth drink, with a crisp and refreshing finish, that lingers a grateful amount of flavor. Carbonated just right, which adds to its crisp taste, without taking away from the overall beer. This beer, has a good amount of AVB, so this really does hit you if you let it it. Also, this is a great beer to have in a Belgian Tulip glass, or in a bottle, but preferably from a glass. Duvel is also great on tap, or course, what beer isn't good on tap. I can go on, this beer was excellent. I recommend this beer, for both a beer selection/collection or to impress your friends.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

I find the need to emphasize the craziness of this head. Pillowy and from out of this world. At smallest, it settles at one finger - and STICKY as hell. This is BEAUTIFUL!  S - Yeasty with considerable citrus and hops. A little bit of orange and much lemon rind. Unlike anything I've ever encountered. Strong, beautiful citrus and potent, honest hops.  T - Like nothing I've ever tasted. Heady and citrusy and the stickyness accompanies the swallow. I'm blown away by this brew and it's the third time I've had it - the best to date. I question whether there are many that can beat this! this is amazing!  M- Perfect - Hoppy, carbonated to the most ideal amount. Very carbonated and hoppy.  D - The most perfect beer I've encountered. Granted, though, you can't have 4 of 'em. Duvel is everything you want in a beer. You should experience it if you get the chance!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,MOB210SA,5,"Nice strong POP from the cork on this one. After having this glass for so long, finally poured into my Duvel glass.  Poured ""unhurriedly"" (and to not disturb the settlement until the end) amazing fluffy 2 fingers of pearl white luscious head. Maintains and hardly receeds, thick heavy blanket on top. A large amount of bubbles showering from the bottom of the glass. Does amazingly look light golden yellow ""pilsner"" like in color- but the color doesnt take away from the ale at all. Huge beautiful sticky lacing that clings and is pretty damn impressive. This beer just looks Alive and couldnt possibly look any better.  I great subtle dark fruitness with a nice amount spices to it that doesnt overwhelm. Smell really is balance nice. Can smell a sweet maltiness. Great fragrance to it, kind of stimulating to the senses. Smell just a beautiful bouquet of all the ingredients within.  The taste goes hand in hand with the smell and is just absolute liquid perfection. Was this brewed on Mt. Olympus? haha  The mouthfeel is perfect. Almost a champagne like bubbliness. Very highly carbonated and bubbles and tingles on the tongue in a great way. An awesome lingering on the tastebuds thereafter. Leaving you wanting more. Smooth and very enjoyable.  When you rate a beer you are comparing this offering to the actual specific style and your own personal taste. I think Duvel couldnt look, smell, taste, or possibly be any better. I would take this over a Delirium any day and this beer is a masterpiece in itself.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,scarfacecrowe,2.96,"Poured the beer from a large pint bottle into a glass. Duvel has a somewhat hazy egg yoke color with a thick snow white creamy head that hangs on forever. I cannot put my finger on the aromas coming off the beer, maybe wet grass? The aroma reminds me of PBR, sort of funky. The beer has a malty, lemon, and bubble gum taste, The aftertaste is a little bitter at the back of the mouth. The mouthfeel is good, the brew is creamy with good carbonation. To be honest, I liked this beer a lot more last time I tried it. Will have to try again.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,eduardolinhalis,4.3,"Classic 330ml bottle poured in a Grimbergen chalice.  As mentioned by others, it's difficult to review such a ""simple"" and ""popular"" beer which is, at the same time, so fantastic.  A: Pours a pale yellow hazy color, nothing special. However, its head is impressively big (actually, huge), bubbled, creamy and persistent. Tons of lacings are left  S: Smell is a bless. Really. Spicy. Stingy. Citrus. Sweet grains. Special attention to the Belgian yeasts and citrus and grassy hops  T: Taste follows the nose. I mean, exceptional. Sweet grains, Belgian yeasts and hops, oh yeah, wonderful hops. In overall, a quite dry beer in the palate. The bitter aftertaste is just a must  M: Heavy creamy body. Huge carbonation. Excellent bitterness  O: The truth is that its taste is simply extraordinary: Delicious malt taste and very bitter end. Its mouthfeel and drinkability are just perfect to a beer with such a high ABV. Therefore, IMHO this beer has a good reputation just because it deserves it... Cheers",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,drabmuh,4.72,"Duvel means devil. This is a great great beer.  Poured from a bottle into a Duvel tulip (0.33L bottle with no date). Beer is hazy and yellow, forms a thick aggressive white head that slowly falls away leaving a complicated net of lacing all over the glass. Good head retention.  Sweet fruit, esters, some yeast, some alcohol, some wheat like aromas, smells amazing.  A little sweet, medium to low bodied. A slight wheaty aftertaste but its not disturbing. Nice fruit flavors. Drinkability insanely high. I love this beer. Mouthfeel has great connectivity and overall one of the best IMO. I love this beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,zoso1967,4.43,"Pours a very pale gold with an immense amount of lovely pillowy foam. Smells strongly of floral hops with a slight whiff of spicy yeast and a pear like sweetness. Tastes quite dry with hops up front and a medley of fruit undertones that fade in as it warms in your mouth. Crisp apple and pear, as well as some wine-like notes that are enhanced by the alcoholic warmth. Nice dry finish and a pleasant lingering bitterness on the tongue. Crisp and probably too drinkable for this high of an ABV. It is obvious why this beer has so many imitators.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Chico1985,3.79,"11.2 oz bottle. Pours very light golden, with the infamous Duvel towering white head. Sediment floats about in a strange vapor-like form. Just the head by itself is more complex than most beers, sits on top the whole time, slowly getting all awesome and chunky looking and leaving good lacing. Smell is strong of yeast, lemon, pear. Not a fan of the pilsner malt used, I'm not really a fan of pils in general and gives it the scent a bit of a macro vibe. Tartness hits your mouth right away followed by many tastes, peppery Belgian yeast, apple, white grape, warming alcohol finish. Definitely alot of complexity here. Pretty good mouthfeel, but I have to knock it down to a 3.5. There is a little too much carbonation and alcohol presence for me, but I suppose that is understandable for the style. Feels very heavy too with a very dry finish. I like the complexity and I can understand why people love this beer, maybe I'm not a huge fan of the style. I had Duvel Draft (aka Duvel Green) and preferred that because of the toned down carbonation and alcohol taste.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,CaptMurdock,4.23,Poured from a corked 22 oz. bottle into a Victory tulip.  Look: This is one of the best looking pours I've ever had. A perfectly white fluffy head takes up almost half of my glass and laces in a spectacular way. I found myself accusing the label of lying because there is no way a bottle conditioned beer can look this clear. The amber hue is absolutely perfect!  Smell: The aroma was a bit livelier than I'm used to with this style. There was a warming sensation of sweetness and the slightest hint of citrus. Nothing overpowering but as you tip the glass the aroma certainly lets you know that it is there.  Taste: I'm really having a tough time with this because if I picked up this bottle without ever hearing all the praise I would absolutely be raving about it. Unfortunately I had always heard that Duvel was the Gold Standard for a Belgian Strong so I held of trying it for so long. Although it was a brilliantly crafted brew it really didn't change the way I looked at the style. Up front the huge head complimented the warmth of the alcohol perfectly. The warmth gave way to some hops and sweetness and the whole thing finished quite dry. These are all the things I look for in a Belgian Strong. Although Duvel did it well I'm not sure it was the best.  Feel: Great carbonation intertwined with the warming sensation of the alcohol really make the mouth feel exceptional. Thin yet heavy. Very well done.  Drinkability: I put a two glass limit here simply because of the ABV. I could see myself going through a few 22 oz if I had no where to be.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Methodd,3.3,"330mL bottle poured into a pint glass. Appearance: Very light golden color. Huge, huge amounts of shock white fizzy head that turns into clumps of white foam. Huge clumpy lacing stick to the glass.  Smell: Nothing remarkable. Citrus and yeast.  Taste: Boozy. Citrus, pear and very yeasty.  Mouthfeel: As the head indicated it's heavly carbonated. Smooth swallow and little after taste.  Drinkability: Typical Belgian Strong. Not really sure what all the hype is about. I'm not a fan of the style but even so I don't see anything to write home about here.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,OnThenIn,4.22,"Appearance: I poured the Duvel into the Duvel glass and had a perfect pour, with the division between the foam and beer at around the middle of the Duvel symbol and the foam reaching the very top of the glass. This ment about four fingers of super fluffy white head that left the most incredible lacing. The color of the beer was a pale golden straw.  Smell: A little sweet with a tiny bit of floral hoppyness. There was also a slight banana and clove aroma. Aroma is this beers worst aspect due to how weak it appeared.  Taste: There was a huge spice flavor with a backing hop bitterness that finishes beautifully clean, crisp, and mildly sweet. There seems to be a bit of clove and banana, as there was in the aroma. It was dry. It is rather reminescent of a hefeweizen and saison put together.  Mouthfeel: The carbonation was to the point of prickly, which is not a personal preference, but it worked rather well in this beer. The body was medium to thin body, with the carbonation providing a great deal of body.  Drinkability: This beer is dangerous. I didn't really fall in love with the style or it after drinking it, but other than in the aroma I couldn't mark it down. I mean this is one of the most finely made beers I have ever or probably will ever have. You can not tell its 8.1% until you start feeling it and if the carbonation was a little lighter you would drink it like it was water. I really wish it was lower abv and cheaper so I could session it.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,ribby,3.76,"Maybe I don't get this style.  Appearance is exceptional. I have never poured a bottle-conditioned brew that is so clear. A lot of carbonation that bubbles up into a head that is tall, but delicate, almost meringue-like.  The smell is fresh and mildly hoppy, with a hint of vegetal character that is stronger in the taste. Maybe it is the nature of the hops, maybe its the alcohol, but it seems a bit off.  The carbonation and head give this an exceptional mouthfeel.  I think that I will try to retaste this one when I work my way through what the beer elves brought me.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Beer is cool but it still remains very powerful and sparkling, we also feel a slight tingling pleasant and characteristic of language.

222,695,RppIII,4.68,"Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Chalice  Appearance- Light Golden with a magnificent cotton froth white two fingered head. Phenomenal head retention and lacing.  Smell- Banana, citrus, and spicy yeast notes assault the olfactory senses.  Taste- Hint of alcohol on top of a heavy pilsner flavour that is in perfect symmetry to the bitterness of the hops. The complexity of this beer is overwhelming and seemingly changes in character as I work my way down the bottle. The yeast, while not overwhelmingly present in its spicy character, adds another layer upon this multifaceted beverage. Together the delicate yeast character, malt flavour, and subtle alcohol presence works in concert to create a beer masterpiece.  Mouthfeel- Holy Bible Batman! The smooth, carbonation, and clean crispness of this beer is absolutely devastating creating an inexorable force that makes you pick up the glass for more of it's aesthetic perfection.  Drinkability- If I did not have a limited supply of this beer I could not stop because of it's sheer drinkability.

I only rated the beer this highly because nothing else I have tasted comes close.  The color is perfectly golden with a thick mousse, you could put it on pie instead of whipped cream it's so thick! When it finally fades it leaves a gorgeous lace. Once the beer warms a touch, it begins to express itself magically. The nose is rich with the sourness that all Belgian golden ales seem to have (from their yeast I bet!), also are hints of banana, clove, hay, and hints of white pepper and other spices. The palate explodes with banana, white fruits, spice, and grass. Very rich. The texture is rich with great balance of flavor, alcohol, and bitterness. So rich yet so smooth, this beer is perfect.

Pours a crystal clear golden straw with a billowing 4 finger white head that filled the rest of the glass. It receded in about a minute to a nice protective layer upon the beer. With each sip new lacing can be seen on the sides of the glass.  Smells almost of a clean crisp lager. I'm just detecting just a little bit of Belgian yeast character.  Taste is near perfection and what I look for in a great pale Belgian. It has this great pilsner malt taste with just a enough floral hops to balance it. The yeast character is complex and so interesting. There is this restrained appleish fruitiness that still lets the malt shine but exhibits its flavors in the background.  The high carbonation fits perfectly and adds to the crispness of the beer. It goes down like water and leaves you wanting more and more.  I'm assuming this is a relatively young Duvel as the best buy date is 2.5 years out and this bottle is from a Christmas gift pack so I'm very interested to see how the flavor profile changes in 1 year, 2 years and maybe even 3 years.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,cavedave,4.46,"Review #100  The look of this is astoundingly good. A light golden color, a bit cloudy with fine yeast, topped by an incredibly full head of white foam that doesn't go away. A shame to destroy this by drinking it.  The nose is a full aroma of light fuits, mild spice, sweet grain, vibrant yeast, alcohol, and hints of floral and citrus at the edge. Very bright bouquet, very seductive, very complex.  The taste of this enters the mouth in a way no other beer can match. It softly climbs onto the palate, bringing a gradual parade of pleasure. Soft and light fruit, a touch of citrus, gentle and tart yeast, sweet grain, a spicy undernote, blended into a long sip that ends between dry and juicy, sweet, tart, and delicious. Alcohol appears as it warms, but the flavors of the fruit, esp. citrus, become more pronounced, and the combination of a bit of alc warmth with the fuller flavors turn this beer into a beautiful drink, art.  Mouthfeel is luxurious, no other word has a hope of explaining how fine this feels in the mouth, how well the feel brings out the best in the flavor, and how the combination creates a marvelous experience.  Drinkability is exceptional. Had I a large enough supply, and readily available medical help, I would undoubtedly drink this until alcohol poisoning prevented me.  Impression: truly one of the finest beers in the world, one I've enjoyed for many years, and the benchmark for simple complexity.

The beer is beautifully gold in appearance with tons of bubbles rising to the surface from all sides. Lacing on my glass indicates I'm in quickly running out of beer! My pour yielded a substantial amount of head (about two fingers), and it had a uniquely fluffy & light texture.  Smells strongly of sweet malts and spices. Mmmm!

A big turn-off, but letting the beer sit for a minute or two allowed me to enjoy the delicious complexity of this brew. Strong malts from start to finish with some fruit thrown in for good measure. Spicy throughout, but ends with a remarkably dry, crisp finish.  Light mouthfeel from heavy carbonation, even after its first few minutes in the glass. This lightness lends itself to making Duvel a highly drinkable brew. It hides its true strength well and invites you to enjoy another!  All in all, this is an excellent beer. I liked it *much* more than I remembered from my previous experience &gt;1yr ago. Small deduction in the T & M for its overly aggressive carbonation (and honestly, this is what I remembered most about my previous glass of Duvel), but this is a very very good beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

This beer has a sweet malty aroma. Almost like a loaf of bread. Also fruity. Some spicey scents as well.  T. Wonderful. Just Wonderful. Fruity sweetness, spicey with alcohol flavors. This beer is very unique. I am not sure that I have tasted another like it.  M. Very carbonated, crisp and refreshing. Also a warming feeling from the alcohol.  D. Too drinkable. In the summer heat this beer goes down very easily but beware because it has a very high ABV.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Eldalonde,3.9,"Pours a very nice light golden color with a tremendously large, thick and chunky head. Smells lightly of belgian spices, lemons, and other sweet citrus fruits. Taste starts off with flavors of sweet citrus fruits, then is complimented by notes of spice and peppar. Some nice yeast qualities are also prevelant with the alcohol that is rather well hidden. The finish is medium in length. A very enjoyable beer on any occasion.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,deleted_user_357747,3.48,"11.2 oz shawty bottle, poured into a Duvel tulip.  A- Duvel pours out a cloudy gold with mad carbonation flowing up from the stem. This beer has an absolutely enormous head; flowing up and out the glass and down the side, like so much Jamaican ocean water running down Eva Mendes' perfect thigh. Such a sexy beer, hold on I need to adjust my trousers...crazy lacing expected.  S- Hops dominate the nose, obviously; flowery smells mixed with grapefruit.  T- Definitely a Belgian pale ale; lots of hops with a lot of alcohol, but the 8.5% ABV is hidden deep within the mountain of hops and that particular Belgian yeast strain that adds extra depth of flavor. Light tasting and almost refreshing.  M- Lighter body and lots of tiny bubbles, makin' me feel fine.  D- Drinkability suffers from it's intense hops character (which I don't personally care for) and it's strong alcohol content (which I do care for). Best drank one at a time to enjoy it at it's fullest.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

There is also a show being put on by the bubbles due to the markings in the glass.  Smell: Very strong yeast aroma followed by faint banana and lemon zest.  Taste: Citrus flavor with some bready malts coming through. After warming up the banana flavors start to come out. Just a little sting of alcohol, but not enough to make it unpleasant.  Mouthfeel: Light, clean and refreshing.  Drinkability: An often overlooked beer for me that I am going to have to start making a regular part of my line up. Very solid and easy drinking, especially at 8.5%.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,brewdoc75,4.56,"A good choice for review number 200.  I first tried this beer several years ago. It came as part of a holiday gift pack. I bought it mainly for the glass, but have come back again and again for the flavor.  A: Pale, crystal clear, yellow. Amazing crown sits on top of the Duvel tulip glass (the only vector to present this fine ale, I might add). The head starts at a healthy 4-5 inches and slowly dwindles to a lasting 1 inch. Reasonable lace along the sides. The etched ""D"" sends the strong carbonation bubbles to supply the everlasating head. Beautiful in all aspects. Iconic.  S: Slight fruitiness. A hint of alcohol. Very faint, grainy sweetness. The hops are floral and aromatic. A little subdued than what I'd like it to be, but very nice for even the biggest hophead. Definitely of the noble variety however.  T: Many layers of flavors in a quite simple beer. Starts with a mild sweetness that is quickly followed by some alcohol. Not fusel alcohol, but a more pleasant variety. The sweetness then goes to the nice ester profile. Some hints of peach and pear. Strong apple flavors at the end. The hops add to the experience with a mild fruitiness. They also seem to add somewhat of a lemon rind character. To summarize, this beer has a ton going on for a recipe consisting of pilsner malt, sugar, yeast, water and hops.  M: Crisp, clean and slightly minerally. The bubbles tickle and scrub the tongue, making this beer crisper than many.  D: A pheonomenal beer. A paragon of the style. The price is a bit higher than many craft beers, but I'm willing to pay it for this gem. A definite pearl in the sea of Belgian beers. Irreplaceable.

Unsurprisingly there's a fair bit of Belgian lace.  Aroma: Stong yeast aroma, with hints of lemon and banana. Good foundation of malt make this a very bold smell.  Taste: Light malt that comes across quite peppery, and a little heat from the higher ABV. Finish is a clear malty taste that seemingly goes on for quite some time.  Mouthfeel: Lively on the tongue with a copious amount of carbonation and an aftertaste that compliments rather than annoys.

This ale has all the elements of an excellent brew with complexity and richness, so I had a difficult time figuring out why it is that I didn't enjoy it very much and would not be returning to it.

Slight malty and banana peel aromas. A faint lemony rubbery aroma.  Taste: Very nice. Tastes like a nice strong pale ale but with that european feel to it. Packed with flavor in such a light colored beer. Alcohol comes through a little bit but its contained through the malty finish. Nice bitter hops on the initial attack.  Mouthfeel: Very carbonated.

Subtle lemon/green apple floral aroma, light Pilsner malt breadiness, as well as spicy notes comparable to white pepper.  Taste: Everything the nose delivers definitely transfers to the taste: citrus bitterness from the hops, pilsner malts, and peppery spice. At 8.5% ABV, the alcohol is absolutely nowhere to be found.

It is phenomenally quaffabble, and offers scarcely a hint of the high ABV that it contains. This is a strong beer that doesn't taste or go down like a strong beer. There are no discretely strong flavours or aromas that I note with this beer - just a smooth and well rounded beer. An 'everyday drinkable' beer that goes down easy.  In Brussels, this can be purchased at just about any corner grocery store or late night shop. It is best enjoyed in its intended Duvel glass, a stemmed tulip glass with a silver rim and distinctly strong curve to the rim. It has a beautiful clear golder color with a lively angel white head of small bubbles that stands long and strong like stiff egg whites.

Duvel tastes light & airy. The yeast retains the upper hand, with a vague, uninsistent fruity taste, like a smoothie. Citrus is the only thing that jumps out, along with the backdrop of spices. Feels a touch jumpy in the mouth, backed up by the never-say-die head, but seems almost appropriate in something this indulgent. No apparent alcohol. Easy, smooth, & I could see that this would be something that would knock you off your barstool unexpectedly after a few pints.  Very good beer.

Tastes clean and like a beer. Well balanced, bitterness offsets the sweet, honey-like flavors of the beer. A beer to enjoy.  Easy to drink. Easy to enjoy.

It brings back great memories of my trip to Belgium that turned me on to beer... I'll never forget the first time I had it, at a great bar where people willingly came over to speak with us and ask us where we were from. Always brings back happy thoughts. I just wish NBLC liquor stores had it here, but I'll be satisfied with getting Ontario friends to bring it to me. At 8.5%, it always makes me feel good, and it's something I could always have again.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,benclimbs,4.43,"The classic 'devil style ale' Appearance is surprising - very light and clearish for a Belgian but the sticky huge head and champagne bubbles give it away.  Smell is all yeast and cloves, mmmm.  Taste is a bit of ripe apricot and pears at the beginning followed by cloves and finishing with a hint of green bell pepper, dry hop bitterness and barely any noticeable alcohol.  Feel is nice, smooth and bubbly but not too effervescent.  This beer is so so drinkable, probably one of the most guzzleable 8%+ beers I've had, though the taste is so good, why would you not sip it?  A true classic, one of the best beers that is widely available worldwide!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,WCBCFrank,5,"Duvel (DOO-VIL, not pronounced DU-VELL) pours golden with a huge fluffy white head. Duvel is basically a super-pilsner with plenty of yeast and snap in every sip. Very drinkable and very powerful - two of these in a half hour might put you in the spins.  Some notes of apple, great lacing in the goblet and good carbonation throughout. A champion beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Beejay,4.3,"Once again, a review from memory since my original review disappeared.  Appearance typical for the style. Smells of sweet fruit, strawberries, and a slight tartness. A bit of a yeasty scent as well. The flavor followed smell. Sweet tasting, delicious with a little bit of tart fruit and yeast. Strawberry flavors prevalent, and a great mouth feel. Overall a delicious brew.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Body is luscious, golden, crisp, slightly cloudy delight.  S - Slightly hoppy, slightly yeasty (good yeasty). Little malt but fresh clean smell.  T - Balanced, clean, flavourful and awesome.Slightly citrusy at first, then pale malt flavours and then a clean hoppy after taste.  M - Carbonated, clean, aftertaste develops different flavours.  D - For 8.1% ABV, amazingly drinkable. Could get massively pissed.  About time I had this beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,hoplover82,4.58,"A-Pours a HUMUNGUS white fluffy head and is a crystal clear light yellow color with lots of bubbles shooting to the top. Very good retention and great lacing.  S-The aroma of spicy hops, pilsner maltiness and cloves fill my nose all at once. But I think it was the hops I first noticed. Faint green apples as well, and some other fruity esthers. The presence hops was a very nice suprise for a change, (in a beer style like this).  T-Much of the same with a very noticable hop bitterenss and more of an earthy hop flavor than spicy, but spicy nonetheless. Very nice balance of green apple and clove spiciness and slight malt sweetness and tartness.  M-This beer is big bodied with a very dry finish and lasting lingering hop bitterness and flavor.  D-For this beer being so big, it goes down very smooth. It says on the four pack that they age the beer before they release it. Maybe that's why I'm not really getting any alcoholness in this. It's very nice indeed. World class I'm sure. Be sure to try this beer if not yet. I'm sure I'll visit this beer again.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Lots of lacing, terrific retention.  Nose is hoppy, with a bit of fruit, maybe apple or pear.  The taste starts off dry and bitter, but quicky moves to a sweeter finish, with a blend of apple, pepper and spices. I can detect the alcohol, but it enhances, rather than hinders the overall experience. Very well carbonated.  A great strong ale, one of the finest that I've encountered thus far!  **UPDATE 1/9/2010  I picked up the Duvel glass and 750ml gift set, and let it age for a month or two. What a difference the tulip glassware makes! After sipping on this for a while, I had to amend my scores from the last sampling. Simply a fantastic brew. Over the last time, I found that the alcohol was a bit more muted (a big plus) and the apple and yeast were more pronounced.

Aroma is pretty skunky...in a good way. Notes of honey, light hops, bread, tarragon, peppercorn.  Taste is remarkable...light and refreshing...bitter up front, but finishing quite sweet. Hints of apple, orange peel, pepper, caramel, honey.  This is an outstanding beer...one that I'm glad has become rather mainstream...available at many bars/carryouts. It's easy to drink, and has quite a layered flavor profile. And that head is classic...sticking around until the bitter end.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Tulip.  Appearance: Slightly hazy, very pale yellow with ballooning foamy head which leaves layers and layers of sticky lace. Bubbles continue to issue forth from the bottom. Looks like a dollop of whipped cream is sitting right on top of the beer.  Smell: Pear, citrus, spice, clove and pepper. Smells tart and dry.  Taste: Spicy, peppery apple is dominant. Light almost wheat-like malts are in the background. Ever-so-slightly tart. Finishes with a spicy, almost metallic bitterness.  Feel: Highly carbonated and extremely light. Unbelievably dry.  Drinkability: Light and refreshing and exceedingly dangerous as the alcohol is completely hidden.

Malty and herbal smell: pale malt, coriander, oats, some light spicy hops, a bit of lemon and some doughy yeast.

A good pour lends itself to a heavy tall standing head trying to climb out of the glass, very sticky foam clings as it slowly settles down into small mounds of froth. Color is pale light gold. Smell is bready, pepper, banana, malt sweetness, maybe some grassy hops.. not sure (nose has been congested for over a month, damn seasonal allergies!) Taste is amazing, everything the smell would entice and more. Clean pale malt, crisp sparkling carbonation, juicy, warming alcohol, whatever it is! It's effin great.  If I were a rich man, this would replace my Budweiser nights.. But alas, craft brews are a once/twice/thrice a week thing in my circumstance which I begrudgingly accept. Despite 8.5% abv, I would drink this all night. An all around great beer which I always return to.  Anyone who says they don't like beer.. hand them a bottle of Duvel, we'll have converts for sure!

With one smell of this beer I'm amazed by how aromatic it is. Delicate spice, cloves, malty sweetness and of course the famous Belgian yeast.  Its really smooth and extremely creamy a very quaffable. Remember those trails of bubbles, well they are the carbonation that provides a crispness to the finish. It is bitter and sweet at the same time, but more so sweet because of the yeast; distinct fruity malt esters, bold spiciness and with a touch of hops to add to the balance. Finishes slightly dry with some left over spice and hops for added bitterness.  Drink it slow and savor its' flavor.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

A massive billowy head plumes forth, leaving a rocky, wavy top to it. Carbonation continually streams from the bottom, and the slightly cloudy gold color looks regal. The glass is  Smell: This smells better than most beers taste. Cloves, fruits -- notably pear, apple -- a wonderful blend of hops above the hint of malt. I only wish it were more pronounced. The smell is almost too weak for a beer this good.  Taste: This really does live up to the hype. a hoppy flash up front, leading to the fruit & spice taste, followed closely by a perfect malty/hop blend, that finishes with a delicate taste of alcohol and more fruity/hop mix -- just reminding you how strong this beer actually is.  M & D: The foam melts over the tongue, adding to the creamy feel. The carbonation is very prevalent, but not biting. The beer almost drinks like a champagne.  Hands down, the most impressive bottled beer I've ever had. Duvel seems appropriate to me almost any time of the year, except maybe the dog days of summer.

A-Pours a pale clear, golden yellow. Looks a lot like a pilsner. A three finger bright white head ensued. Heavy, stick lace. I have never seen a beer produce such profuse lace. A gorgeous appearing beer.  S-Aroma was the weakest characteristic to me. Present were fruity, yeasty, sweet candy and malty notes.  T-Tantalizing. Bohemian hops and pilsner malts predominate producing an amazingly crisp, clean, and refreshing beer that is sweet like pears with a zesty lemon twang, and a very slight, pleasantly so, clove like yeast taste. Surprisingly, I can't taste the alcohol. I like this better as the temperature rises above the brewer's recommended 40-50 degree Fahrenheit.  M-Very smooth for 8.5% ABV. Carbonation level is perfect. Light like a pilsner, but full flavored like an ale. The Moortgat Family hit a home run with this, if they can appreciate the metaphor from the great American pastime.  D-Amazingly so, for a beer with 8.5% ABV. I only believe this because of the label and the beginning of a buzz.  This is a world class, extraordinary beer.

S- The smell of perfume and light yeast and hints of pears and pepper are noted in the background.  T- Soft fruity notes are blended with a hint of spice and sourness. The fruit has qualities of pears, oranges with a slight buttery corn hint but it is very light. This finish has a nice hop bitterness that mixes with the spiciness of the beer.  M- Light mouthfeel with a hint of fizz in the texture. No astringency or alcohol warmth.  D- This beer is truly light and it does have some nice complexity in flavor. The buttery corn notes as it warmed seem to interfere with the other flavors but not a great deal. The head is simply incredible and the lace just last and last.

Smell: Bright, sweet pear aromas up front...it's like cutting up a fresh pear...the fruity aromas are the strongest here, though there are touches of honey and and spice in the background as well.  Taste: Sweet stone fruits and pear, some spicy phenols, and a big kick of alcohol. Some mild, very lightly toasty malt in the background as well. I swear I get a touch of vanilla in here too. Some nice spicy hop bitterness on the finish as well.  Mouthfeel: Very highly carbonated, prickly, yet somehow creamy at the same time...medium alcoholic feel here as well.

Appearance: Pours a nice pale, straw color with an enormous, sticky head that leaves a tinge of lacing on the glass.  Smell: Sweet malts and yeast, apple, clove and pear. Not bad.  Taste: What an explosion of taste. Bright fruits and yeast jump out at you up front. Finishes with a touch of sourness but so clean and dry.  Mouthfeel: Exceptional. Full-bodied, sharp and leaves your mouth dry and wanting more. Stings your tongue just enough.  Drinkability: For an 8.5% beer, this hides its alcohol very well. Pretty drinkable for what it is.  I don't know why, but I thought this beer might have been hyped a little too much, perhaps because it's so available. After trying it, this is definitely not the case.

222,695,Paisan,4.95,"""Duvel"", Flemish (not Dutch!) for ""devil"", is very aptly named, for this can be a sneaky little bastard. This beer is so drinkable, and the alcohol so well hidden that you tend to forget this is 8.5 ABV, and before you know it, it bites you in the lower posterior regions.  Pour this gently (sediment!) in its tulip glass, and you will create a whirlpool of gold, a tornado in a field of barley under a towering white cloud - and just like the weather in Flanders, this cloud will not easily disappear. After the rising rain has stopped, you notice the nearby orchard, you can smell the apples and pears. And then you get high on the bittersweet sensation of being part of and immersion in Nature's abundance.  This will quench your thirst any time: aperitif, with your meal, digestif, on a sunny terrace... The well-present bitterness of the fine hops is nicely balanced by the slight sweetness of the alcohol - the only indication you'll get of its presence... until it's too late.  This is most definitely not an average beer, but luckily in Belgium this is an EVERYDAY beer! This is one every beer afficionado should try, over and over.

The head is absolutely tremendous - frothy, voluptuous excellence. Abundant lacing and great head retention. Head eventually settles into a thin crown around the glass, with a nice island of frothy head floating around. Truly gorgeous beer.  Smell is of fruity sweetness. Taste is similar to the smell - there's a slight spiciness here that's noticed immediately. Kind of lemon/citrus thing going on. Mild bitterness that becomes most noticed during the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and highly carbonated.  Extremely drinkable. This thing is a pleasure on the tastebuds.

The head on this beer left me in awe. Leaves chunky lacing as the head retreats. Smells of fruity and sour, is reminiscent of a saison or a weak gueuze. This sour does not really translate into the taste of this beer, only a slight tartness on the back end. This beer tastes balances grain and fruit pretty well. The grain from the malt is what strikes the palate first with a bread ike characteristic then the fruit makes itself apparent as the beer creeps back. The fruit tastes like a bitter and sour green apple, maybe even the tart twang of a white grape. Nice dry finish. Lively beer in the mouth. High carbonation, very light, with a dry finish I enjoyed this beer, but I think it is better suited for an earlier time of day. I picture it best to be enjoyed in the early afternoon overlooking some rolling hills in the countryside. The light grain character to it makes it refreshing like a good Pilsener. The malt and the hop are very balanced, in accordance to the style. They are so well balanced in fact, initially it was hard to discern where one ended and one began. This is a nice refreshing beer to have, but not entirely sessionable, a little too much carbonation and at 8.1%, I don't think you want to be drinking these all day, or the Duvel in you might come out.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

How a beer could look more perfect than a perfectly poured Duvel into the corresponding glass is beyond me.  The aroma is lightly fruity with notes of pear, apple, banana, and honey followed by deeper vanilla and black pepper tones as it warms.  The beer hits the tongue with an initial wave of yeast-derived fruitiness and a light hop spice coupled with the clean flavor of Belgian and French pilsener malts. An elegant bitterness shows up just before the ultra-dry and silky ale leaves the palate. The 8%+ alcohol is nowhere to be found.  As quickly as this complex, refresing ale hits the taste buds it goes, leaving the palate cleansed with a tickle of carbonation as it's swallowed.

Tons of lacing as the foam forms a sweet looking mesa in the middle of the tulip glass. Exceptional looking beer.  Nose is of bready and fruity yeast, light graininess, rock candy and grassy hops. All the ingredients of beer are detectable in almost equal amounts in the aroma, very nice.  Grainy malt and alcohol are the first things to hit my palate with some bready yeast coming shortly after. Then a sharp bitterness at the end, accentuated by some more of the alcohol. Body is light and carbonation is high, perfect for the style.

S- Classic yeasty belgian aromas and pale malts are accompanied by some spritzy stale hops in the nose. Further examination reveals TINY hints of straw and earth.  T- The taste is simple, yet elegant- pale crackerlike malts meet low-alpha hot bitterness. It all ends with a long and dry finish.  M- TONS of carbonation.

The very nice soft golden color reminded me of ripened wheat fields, and the bubbles that continued to fizz after the pour made it a great drink to look at, let alone drink. The aroma ascending from the delightful little bubbles was very nice, a bright floral zesty scent.  I expected to have my mouth knocked around a bit with the alcohol content of 8.5, but it was exceedingly drinkable! I was surprised! The flavor is sunny, with a zest that holds some citrus notes (to my palate anyway) and leaves a mild and rather lingering (though not unpleasant aftertaste).  This beer was recommended to by by a little shop owner who thought it was great fun to tease me about American macros!

Heavy lacing.  Nose- Somewhat subdued. Apples, lemons and pears show through a slight yeast spiciness that grows as it warms.  Palate- First sip is very crisp and almost cidery, then the beer opens up to reveal a very enticing brew. Hops up front, malt in the finish, but at the same time very dry. Yeast spiciness evident throughout. Slight alcoholic warmth.  Mouthfeel- Medium bodied, lively carbonation.  Drinkability- Wow. I think that about sums it up.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,BeerSingh,4.3,"One of the most awesome and big beers for me till now. Got it here finally in Hoboken, NJ. Poured from a bottle into a snifter. The colour was a pale golden with a great, white head. Plenty of bubbliness evident. Smelt of lemons and fruit first up with liitle notes of grain. Ok, the beer is massive on taste - really bitter first up then dissolving into grain, malt and slight dryness, but the bitterness just stays on and on. Amazing tenure on the palate, keeps you wanting for more and more. Superb concelament of the alcohol. Great beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,mightymoksha,4.71,"Served in tulip glass.  Pours a cloudy, pale gold. Very noticeable carbonation. Snow-white head with ridiculous stickiness and outrageous retention. It isn't going anywhere.  Aromas of green apples, flambéed bananas, spices and yeast are prominent.  Very crisp pale malt flavor balanced superbly with a mild bitterness and a very pleasant carbonation. Alcohol is very elusive. Finishes quite dry with notes of clove and fruits.  Mouthfeel is just fantastic. Very clean and very smooth, with a medium-yet-lively body.  Drinkability is off the charts for me. Almost too delicious. But not quite.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,infi,4.43,"Poured into a snifter.  A nice translucent golden pour that creates an incredibly frothy and pillowy white head that retains for a longer duration that most beers. Knowing how to pour unhurriedly and patiently will really create the most eye-appeasing brew in your glass. That fat head really is an immense part to the visual aspect of the beer. The smell is full of an apple tartness, Belgian yeast, gentle spices and an alcoholic odor.  The taste is initially full of a hoppy forefront with a sort of bitterness, which leads to a malt breadiness and fruity tartness and subtle bitterness and then ends with the gentle alcoholic warmth. The brew has a light-bodied mouthfeel with some hints of carbonation and leaves a nice crisp and dry aftertaste. The drinkability is incredibly high - deserves the 5.  Definitely worth its accolades. Definitely worth the money. Definitely worth having in the fridge at all times.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Hint of alcohol  T- Perfect hop and malt balance... starts off and finishes with some hoppiness with mixed in citrus and malt sweetness... no alcohol taste despite the hint in the aroma  M- Very smooth... little carbonation, light bodied  D- Very drinkable and refreshing, I would definately go for another",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,mirish72,4.7,"First of all, let me admit that reviewing this beer is somewhat nerve wracking. It is a true classic and anything I write doesn't measure up to the true characteristics of this beer.  Poured into a Portsmouth tulip glass, not a Duvel glass, but close. Having learned, I poured it slow so the head didn't explode. The pour was perfect and not too huge, that being said, when I let it settle, it had doubled in size and was perfect, probably 4 fingers and almost a third of the glass. The beer was golden and gorgeous.  The aroma was incredible, it was the perfect mix of apples, spices, pale malts, and cloves. The taste was dry with a perfect crisp finish. Others have said it reminded them of champagne and I tend to agree, truly amazing.  Obviously I cannot afford to drink Duvel every day, but it is an incredible beer, one that you measure all others against. Everything that accompanies this beer is amazing, from the bottle to the glass, it is truly an experience.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,nickd717,4.21,"Revisited this old buddy last night and figure it's time to update my prior ticker-like review of this beer to a better one. This is a solid widely available Belgian brew, always a crowd pleaser. It claims to define the Belgian Strong Golden Ale category, and it really does just that. 330ml squatty-ass bottle from Whole Foods Los Altos.  Pours a stunning clear golden-yellow color with a large white head that looks pretty impressive in that Duvel tulip. Good retention. I can see why this is a selling point for the beer, as it sure as hell looks impressive.  Aroma of yeast, grain, green apples, spice, and pale malt. Nothing too special, but just smells plain good.  Flavor is yeasty with fruity esters and well-spiced. Some slightly tart green apples, lemon, citrus, and mild hoppiness. Again, great balance. Very subtle.  Medium-light body with fairly high carbonation. Very dry, clean, and crisp, almost champagne-like.  Drinkability is very high. This is just so clean and balanced that it never overwhelms your palate and goes down amazingly easily. Not in the least bit boozy. Overall, just a plain, no-frills, well-done Belgian ale. Always a good call when options are limited, or even when they aren't.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,duells2000,4.78,"This beer is the reason I'm here on beer advocate. It showed me there were incredible beers out there that I needed to find. I drank guinness like a fish before trying this beer, happy and content in my ignorant bliss. Now I rarely will go to the neighborhood bar, and my fridge looks like a liquor store of fine beers.  First as you pour this beer you must be careful not to have the head explode all over place. It rises like an atomic mushroom cloud, a yeast explosion that ends up like meringue filling the top third of your glass.  The smell to me is apples, green sour apples. Lemons come up a little but it smells alive and fresh.  The first sip is like super carbonated and dry but still has alot of body. It fills your mouth with the carbonation but after you swallow it's that famous AHHHH from every Coke commercial. It's not heavy, little or no alcohol bite, but it can sneak up on you. It starts to warm you up and you sense that you better slow down a bit and sip.  You can drink this very easily if you don't believe me google the ""Duvel challenge"". It's light and fresh but it will kick your ass if you over-endulge.  I think Duvel gets a slightly bad rap because it is becoming more available. Just because my local grocery store carries it doesn't mean it's suddenly bad. I'm sure Point Beer is rare in Belgium.

Nice retention with a ton of splattered lace and rings.  Aroma: Wow I am really enjoying the aroma. Nice clove and spice flavor. Some bananas and fruits. There is also a big yeast aroma. Everything blends together so nice here.  Taste: Very yeasty. A lot of clove and spices here. I get some bananas and a fruit flavor mix. Reminds me a little of a saison and hefe combined together. Well done. I really have to give this a 4.5 because it is simply amazing for how light of a beer it is.  Mouthfeel: This is one of the best crisp beers I have had. Very crisp, a little boozy, but smoothes out nice. It seems to be just a little to carbonated for me. It isn't bad or anything, just not for me. Body is actually fairly light for the abv it has. Ends with a pretty clean, yeast flavored aftertaste.  Overall, this beer is pretty solid. I will definitely be keeping this one around more. It is just so drinkable. It is just so well crafted.

222,695,PerroGrande,4.45,"Appearance: Pours to a slightly hazy straw color with prodigious, wide-bubbled foam - almost soap-suds in appearance. Some unreleased carbonation (even after an aggressive pour) rises tantalizingly.  Smell: A delightful, yeasty, bready scent with a slight hint of hops.  Taste: Wow! This is a great tasting beer. Starts out with subtle bread/yeast hints which give way to a slightly bitter, hoppy finish. I taste an ever-so-slight hint of alcohol, and get a gentle warming in my chest from this brew.  Mouthfeel: Good. Some unreleased carbonation hangs around the edges a bit. Light overall mouthfeel, but not watery.  Drinkability: This beer sports an ABV of 8.5% but is so smooth, tasty, and nice to drink, I would be hard pressed to guess this were it not printed on the label. The mild warmth that this brew imparts is perhaps the only clue to this relatively strong alcohol content.  I'm really glad this one made it into my cart. The Anderson's (Dublin, Ohio) has this beer, and I'm glad they do! One other note... If you're like me and prefer a fairly aggressive pour, go slow with this one. It produces substantial amounts of foam, and it would be a shame to waste even a drop of this delightful beer on a foam-over.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Appearance: As the style tends to go, pale yellow color with very white head and laced well. Carbonation is ample, with the cork leaving with a large pop, and poured bubbly like champagne.  Smell: Clovy, spicy, and yeasty in that Belgian fashion. I wasn't ever blown away by it, but the smells are layered and there. Allspice-type herbiness creeps in at the end, but the clove and slight hops are the more dominant scents.  Taste Light clove and spice flavor over an almost woody textured flavor. Apples and clove really strike a tone, and goes down pretty smooth. Texture is smooth and makes for a easy-drinking flavor as the flavors really aren't that strong. 8.5% alcohol is nowhere to be found, which is a testament to the smoothness.  Mouthfeel: Covered bove a bit, but very very smooth. Almost creamy. But the carbonation is so sharp, smooth almost isn't the word. But all of it attributes to its . .  Drinkability: Not amazing, but very quaffable and easy to drink.

More hop flavor than expected, which is a good thing.  M - I love the mouthfeel. The carbonation is perfect for this brew. Its thin, but it sort of sticks to your mouth.  D - Very drinkable.

Hops provide a decent balance to the taste, but less obvious in the taste than the smell. Alcohol hardly noticeable - only gives a little kick to the back of my throat.  M: Good carbonation.

222,695,washburnkid,4.54,"Stubby bottle to tulip.  A: Hazy (I swirled and poured the last quarter of liquid...I love my yeast!) straw hue with champagne-like bubbles that are helping to form a massive, active white head. The fluffy marshmallow head rocks. There's a ton of retention and spider web lacing. I love it. S: Definite Saaz hop type aroma. There's a very clean, fresh cut grass hop on the nose. It's so crisp and clean. At first I think to myself, ""Wow, there's no metallic at all!"", but 3 more minutes of warmth say otherwise. The metallic starts at the back, sort of in passing. Then I get a sweet honey malt to balance it out and sort of shoo it away. Then one or two more minutes and the aroma is huge on metallic. I'm interested in why this happens? I look forward to the flavors. T: Some great complexity here that I didn't immediately recognized with the aroma. There's some wheat and spice (clove, perhaps?) characteristics that really dominate on the first sip. Banana and unripe stone fruit. While there is heavy metallic on the nose, I don't get much of it in the flavor. I'm impressed. It is very refreshing and smooth...easy to drink (and with an 8+%ABV, it's bordering on dangerous!). Forget about decanting this ale. I swirled up that sediment and threw it in and got a ton of clove and yeast. So delicious. One other important note is that I can't sense the alcohol here at all. M: Medium body with low-medium carbonation. Very smooth. D: Wow, give me another because I finished this one in less than 10 minutes.

It is now my birthday, and being the beer geek that i am, i am in front of the computer reviewing a beer instead of spending time with actual humans. Actually, I just stole away for a few minutes to review this amazing beer.  It poured a beautiful golden straw color. A vigorous pour into the tulip glass produced an enormous billowy, chunky, crazy huge head that never went away and made cotton candy-like lacing that clings like glue to the side of the glass.  The smell is of lemon and flowers.  The taste is a complex mix of citrus and belgian yeasty goodness. No alcohol burn noticeable, but at the end of this beer (as i am writing this), i'm feeling the woozy leg buzz.  It finishes quite dry and is very refreshing. This is truly a delightful beer.

222,695,woosterbill,4.34,"750ml corked and caged bottle, best by date 25/07/2011, into the Duvel tulip - I use this glass for 90% of my home beer drinking, so it's awesome finally to give it its proper partner.  A: Breathtaking beer. Pours a clear gold topped with a full three inches of rich, chunky white head - three times in a row. The head is so clingy that what sticks to the glass can hardly be called lace: it's like half the head never goes away. The final pour from the bottle brings some cloudy yeastiness, but up until then the clarity left a great view of the carbonation rising steadily from the etched ""D"" on the bottom of the glass. Epic.  S: Not quite as epic as the appearance, unfortunately. Crisp hoppiness dominates (some floral, grassy notes), with a bit of malt sweetness and some warming alcohol as well. Pretty well balanced, but nothing to write home about. The German hops make it smell more like a pilsner than a Belgian to me.  T: Ah, this is better. All the clean notes from the nose carry through, but after the hops give way to the malt, the Belgian yeast comes through with a spicy, fruity, dry finish. Very crisp and refreshing, with only the mildest indication of the high ABV. Very tasty indeed.  M: Very highly carbonated (something that I like more for how it makes a beer look than for how it makes it feel), but the bubbles are fine enough to keep things fairly creamy. Medium-bodied and lively.  D: Hides the alcohol amazingly well, and the crispness of the finish makes me want to keep drinking and drinking and drinking. Devilish indeed.  Notes: I never though I'd enjoy looking at a beer this light, but something about the outrageous head and the appropriate glassware made this one a real sight to behold.

I have to decide do I want to rate this beer against all others, or do I want to rate it by itself? There are other's beers I would choose first, if foreced to choose, but I would never sit with a glass of Duvel and think I wish I had something else. This is a rather large beer that is incredibly drinkable, the flavores are good but not so strong as to put off novice craft beer drinkers. With that in mind, I think I should review the beer on it's own merit and not in relation to countless others.  A - poured from bottle into a pint glass. It pours a hazy yellow color. It has a huge shaving cream head that coats the glass.  S - spice, piney, peach? orange?, tart but not the lemon zest I expected.  T - light malt start folled by spice. I looks like a pilsner, but it is heavier and not as crisp.  M - high carbonation medium bodied, clean and dry.  D - Spicy with a piney, undertone.

Pours with a large, light, fluffy head that dissipates very slowly to leave behind only a pillows of foam. Like clouds in heaven where I might find myself drinking it (which makes me wonder, why name it 'Devil'?). Has a very light yellow color, only slightly hazy from some yeast, and tiny champagne-looking bubbles.  Strength of aroma is mild, but with some effort, is very good. Mostly yeast, bready, hint of lemon, a bit of clove. Hop aroma is barely there, almost non-existent.  Extremely smooth & balanced flavor. At first taste, I thought it would be similar to a pilsner. After a few more, I realized it never had that bitter finish, but stayed a little on the sweeter side instead. Hints of lemon come through, with a bit of very mild hops on the back side. No hits of alcohol on the tongue, despite the 8.5%.  Carbonation was tremendous. Tiny, velvety bubbles similar to champagne. Slightly more thickness than a pilsner, but far less than say a hef.  Overall, I don't know how you could improve the drinkability of this beer. Unbelievably smooth, balanced, and complex.

222,695,flagmantho,4.35,"Poured from 11.2 oz bottle into a wine goblet.  Appearance: nice golden color with an attractive 1-finger head.  Smell: malt, plenty of it, and spicy hops. Notes of something tangy; almost ... mustard-y. Definitely not something I've encountered before, but I must say it's not a bad thing.  Taste: the taste is much different than I expected, given the aromas I sensed. Plenty of nice malt flavor, but the hops are much gentler and floral in flavor. There's definitely an alcohol bite to it. As it warms, I find that the malt flavor seems more... mature, or sophisticated, than, say, an APA. After I learn more about Belgians, this is one I will definitely have to revisit.  Mouthfeel: very good. There's a sweet spot in these medium-to-slightly-heavy higher alcohol beers where the right level of carbonation just makes them creamy and delicious, and Duvel really hits it.  Drinkability: if I had a big bottle of this stuff or access to it on tap, I could see myself getting into a whole lot of trouble.

222,695,BlackBearForge,4.7,"Bottle says best by January 2011. I've had it the better part of a year.  This beer sits a lovely lemony golden in color in the Duvel glass, the stream of bubbles constantly rising to support the huge creamy white head that lasts and lasts to the very end leaving great foamy swaths of curtains on the side of the glass.  The aroma isn't as strong as I expected but is very nice. I pick up some heady alcohol, some bright fruit notes and a clean yeastiness as well as a sweetish candy smell I can't quite place.  The huge flavour is simply exceptional and so well integrated no one thing really stands out, though each takes it's place in turn. There is a noticeable alcohol warmth, inobtrusive, that seems to back up the flavors but also builds a bit as it warms. There is mild clove, a bit of peperiness and mellow fruit, perhaps a bit banana, a bit of tart lemon, pear and apple but also a bit of grainy yeast and hop that tells you this is a beer. Noted as well is a bit of toffy being perhaps the candy aroma I noted in the smell. Slightly bitter, slightly sweet, sightly tart, slightly sour, the flavours roll about the mouth. As it warms the flavours and alcohol meld and become even more balanced and noticeable.  The mouthfeel is also very very good, full bodied but seeming light even so. Creamy and carbonated to perfection, with very fine phalanxes of bubbles prickling across the tongue. The finish finish is as complex as the flavor, seemingly sweet, tart and a bit sour but ultimately is crisp but not overly dry.  Hennepen, a nice Framboise and Duvel have been my introductions to the world of Belgian beers. Some good friends of mine gave my wife and I two Duvel gift sets, the ones with the Duvel glass, for our 25th anniversary this past weekend and I'm looking forward to letting them age a bit like the one I just reviewed. Then again I may not be able to wait! These are simply delicious beers.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Grunewald,3.86,"A - poured from a 330ml bottle into a tulip glass. It pours a cloudy pale yellow color. The beer has a creamy head that leaves huge globs of lacing.  S - sap, pine, oranges, spice and warm alcohol  T - sweet malt that turns piny and spicy  M - high carbonation and dry  D - taste similar to champagne. This is something to sip and enjoy though the bitter pine taste seems too strong.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,boatshoes,4.03,"Had this accompanying a great dinner at the Mews in Provincetown with my girlfriend. Great beer to accompany great comapny, atmosphere, and food. If only they had better beers to go with the Duvel...  Appearance- Beautiful beer. Served with a Duvel tulip pint (is there any other way?!!) and happily the waitress didn't attempt to pour this one for me but rather let me do the honors. Massive billowing head off a mild pour. Sparkling golden body with lots of active carbonation. Head sticks around for quite awhile before dying down. Very impressive looking beer as always.  Smell- Very tasty smelling nose. Lots of big accents of bread and yeast primarily. The two scents work perfectly together and create an aroma that smells a little something like fresh baked sourdough. Quite nice.  Taste- Much like the nose, huge yeastiness. Lots of yeast, lots of malt, lots of bread, with just a touch of astringent alcohol bite on the way down to dry the palate and keep you drinking. A bit on the sweeter side, but not overpoweringly so by any means, and probably helps to hide the alcohol. Great flavor and a great example of the style.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Mouthfeel is very nice with lots of active carbonation, any more and it would be boarding on too much, but I think it's just the right amount. Drinkability is great too for the alcohol content and despite the sweetness. Could have put back a couple of these.  Overall, not my favorite example of the style, but certainly a classic and a great example nonetheless in my opinion. Certainly give it a try if you haven't.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,JoEBoBpr,4.66,Poured into a tulip from the bottle. A - It pours a beautiful strong golden straw color with some haze. The head is about 2 inches and its very dense but chunky at the same time. Retention is ridiculous; at no point does the head fully recede.  S - Smells of some nice pepper and some coriander as well as a slight clove smell. Some sweet fruit like peach is also present. The smell is also very malty and has some hints of nuts and bread.  T - Very bready but sweet malty taste with some nice yeast residue. A slight hint of clove is present on the tongue as well as a very clean and crisp malty and bready taste. Extremely delicious with a slight alcohol sweetness and warmth at the end.  M - Perfect carbonation a great brew! D - Absolutely refreshing a pleasure to drink.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Evocatus,4.13,"Pours with a beautiful light yellow haze and a thick white foam for a head that lingers until the end. Smells of sweet bread/malts. Taste starts off as sweet and sour but ends up dry and ""alcoholy."" The head makes it a bit thicker, and the carbonation is pretty evident. Pretty good overall, even with an ABV of 8.5%, the alcohol wasn't really that strong compared to others of a similar level.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,TheHammer,3.88,"Picked this up at an LCBO in Burlington I believe. Recall it being one of the top 100 beers, so I thought I would give it a whirl.  Appearance: Holy crap does this beer have head. It poured with three fingers of head and made the glass into a lace magnet. The beer itself is a crystal clear yellow gold, that has a certain charm to it. The only downside is the carbonation is massive. I've never seen a beer more carbonated then a soft drink.  Smell: I'm catching some sour apple notes, although not sour in a beer has gone bad way. Also has a nice backing of barley and a malt texture. This beer didn't take any warming to come out, but it's high alcohol content can definitely be sniffed out.  Taste: Well it certainly doesn't mask it's high alcohol content, as it permeates until the end. Starts with a fruity apple and grape taste that shifts to a more malty and bread/yeast taste and ends with a hint of citrus hops. I wouldn't say it's a buffet of flavor but it has a good taste that is not subdued.  Mouthfeel: Unsurprisingly way too carbonated, this causes it to get an almost liquored up soda pop kind of texture. However, it leaves a nice bread aftertaste and transitions decently. It's also worth noting that this beer is so carbonated, in what was not an aggressive pour that I spent a good deal of time sipping at the head before I got to the beer, and I'm not one to want to wait that long for my beer.  Drinkability: Well it does a lot of things right. It is easy on the stomach, but surprisingly it isn't giving me any gas issues given the carbonation. It's refreshing but it's got a bit too strong an alcohol taste for a beer to be that easy a drinker, and is a bit too carbonated for practical drinking for anything but a special occasion. Still, a fairly solid offering.  Final Thoughts: This clearly a beer for the beer enthusiast and not your average drinker. It's good, yes, but I wouldn't say it's one of my favorites. This beer honestly reminds me of champagne, in that yes it is good, but only in small doses. You should try this beer at least once, and this would be a great session ale, if it's alcohol content wasn't so high.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,JRhode,4.6,"750 Bottle split between two Duvel tulips with jessethehutt.  Glowing golden with a huge head. Clumpy globs of lacing on the glass like fake snow on a window. Could be mistaken for an adjunct lager once the head dissipates.  Initial smell is candied green apple, followed by yeast and spice.  A little Belgian funky yeast, followed by slight hop bitterness and black pepper. Finishes clean and dry with a little alcohol bitterness.  Highly carbonated and lively on the tongue.  Could drink this beer all day and night until the 8.5% abv puts me out. Off the charts.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,blackc5,4.3,"Poured from an their 11.2 oz bottle into a snifter.  A - Pours a glossy golden yellow with quite a thick, cloud-like head. Easily 2 and a half fingers despite a careful pour. Medium lacing.  S - Lots of fruitiness right off the bat, bready maltiness, and you can definitely catch the alcohol right there on the nose.  T - Quite complex with great threads of fruit, bready yeast, sweet malt and just a touch of proper bitter twisting through it. The fruit is mainly citrus with a bit of tart apricot, yet also some sweet peach. Quite perfectly balanced between all of the flavors going on. That said, perhaps just a bit mellow yet for my taste, but that is not a knock on this most excellent beer. Sometimes mellow is exactly what you want.  M - High carbonation and a dry finish. Some bubbling action like champagne almost. Very nice.  D - Sky high. Too easy to drink as it is so smooth and balanced. The 8.5% is very well hidden even though you do catch in in the aroma. That said, it is best enjoyed as a sipper.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Golden, with a massive fluffy head that lingers for a while and leaves a lot behind.  Smell: Slightly grassy, with a lot of citrus and fruit (apple?) notes.  Taste: Starts sweet and slightly tart, with a finish of bitter hops, apple-like flavor, and a pretty strong alcohol warmth.  Mouthfeel: Pretty light-bodied, with a sharp but pleasant carbonation bite. Pretty dry and very smooth.  Drinkability: A sipper, but oh so wonderful.

222,695,randawakes,4.78,"Tried at Onion Creek bar/grill in Houston, TX. Poured this into a tulip Duvel glass. YOU better try this beer you Belgian lover you. Read no further if you haven't tried this yet and go get one.  Appearance: beautiful, it pours one of the thickest heads I've seen, half the beer takes up more than half the glass on a decent pour. Lace is there.  Taste: Fruit hops that accompany the poignant smells. Creamy champagne with a balanced sweet spice that warms the mouth. I taste a mix of lemon and apple/pear. Although the color is fairly light, don't let this trick you. It is a mouthfeel with moving carbonation and little alcohol tones that lies behind the boldness of the beer that is disguised by the lighter color.  Drink it.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Smell: fruity, spicy, alcoholic, and some smell I couldn't define, a bit like sour sewer water.  Taste: a mixture of apple cider and champagne, fresh taste! A bit sour-bitter hoppy after taste. Spicy and some hints of alcohol  Mouthfeel: thin and smooth. Medium high carbonation . Overall a nice refreshing beer. Not my favourite because of the smell, but will never refuse one.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,BigMike,4.56,"Poured from a 750ml corked bottle into my new Duvel Tulip glass. A best by date of 7/11 on the bottle.  After hearing about the much hyped Duvel tulip glass i had to order one and see what the fuss is all about. The glass came today and i headed to Capone's to see what i could find to christen the glass with. As i looked around i saw the Duvel bottle and said, what better to beer to break in my Duvel glass with then the beer itself. I also have never enjoyed a Belgian brew before so needless to say this is a big moment in my beer drinking journey.  Pours a light straw yellow color. Looks like a light apple juice or a light pilsner. Warning: pour this one slowly like the bottle says because the head forms quickly and grows to take up half the glass. The head is pure white and consistency is a bit thicker then beaten egg whites. Almost a cool whip type feel to it. It also hugs the glass all the way down. One of the best lacing beers i have seen.  Smell is very reminiscent of a champagne. Alot of alcohol and fruitiness. Sour apple and spice. Pears and yeast round it out. The flavor is close to the aroma. This one really drinks more like a champagne. The flavor is alot more complex then one would think based on appearance. This is one of the smoothest beers ever. The flavors are pepper and lemon zest. Sour apple and alcohol.  Mouthfeel is amazing. Light airy,yet creamy and rich. So so easy to drink. In fact, while typing i'm 3/4 of the way through the 750ml bottle. The 8.5% is kicking in and this beer is becoming more enjoyable as it warms to arouns 50 degrees or so.  Needless to say, drinkability is off the charts. This one needs to be savored on special occasions. Im so glad i got to try this one. I know am no longer a virgin to Belgians. This is probably going to open up lots of doors for me and broaden my horizons. I highly recommend this one!  PS. The tulip glass rules!! It really heightened the whole experience for me.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,DV8HARD,3.83,"I served it in a Pilsener glass and wow, the head was at least 5 fingers. I should have paid attention to the label ""pour slowly"". The foam really sticks to the glass like no other beer. It is very light in color but, not golden, more like a hazy yellow which is appealing.  When it comes to taste the first thing noticed is the alcohol. It really packs a punch, it's difficult at first to make out the flavors because of it. The most prominant tastes are that of honey and malt.  I would recommend this beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,CHSLBrew,4.4,"Squat bottle poured into a Duvel snifter.  A-Pours a huge, pale-white head, strong retention and rocky as it receded with nice lacing. Beer was a pure golden color, with an ever-minimal haze and a visible carbonation bubble stream (from the etched D at the bottom).  S-Spicy clove, slight black pepper, bready malt with a hint of wet yeast.  T-All the same spiciness of the aroma is transferred directly to the flavor, along with some additional yeast-influenced spices. Some sharp fruitiness mingles with a smooth alcohol character. Hint of vanilla with a slightly creamy semi-sweetness.  M-High carbonation, characteristic of this style of brew. Mouthfeel is medium to medium-heavy. Slight warming after the first sip let me know I was drinking a moderately high ABV brew.  D-So drinkable. Oh so drinkable. Delightfully drinkable, complex and smooth. A classic brew, with good reason.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Then i started drinking the classic belgiums; singles, doubles, triples and quadruples. And this one was often overlooked. But now it's my by-far favorite. Taste, ballance, hops, bitterness, mouthfeel. There is nothing about this beer that's bad.  I opened a 750 ml bottle of this the other day and forgot about it in my fridge.

222,695,Vengeance526,4.18,"Pours a beautiful light golden color with a large pillowy white head that has great retention and leaves plenty of lacing.  Aroma exhibits qualities that are fruity, yeasty and spicy. At the end, there is more of a citrusy smell on top of the already present light fruit aromas.  Taste is mostly like the smell. A very dstinguished spicy profile surrounds flavors of lemon, apple and pear, and some light yeast notes can also be detected.  Mouthfeel exhibits a lot of active carbonation and overall very crisp. A classic Belgian ale and all around very refreshing.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,DefenCorps,4.83,"Grabbed a 4-pack the day before and this is the last bottle :-(  A: In my trusty Duvel glass, a careful pour yields a brilliantly clear light yellow beer with a massive 2-finger plain white head. The high carbonation makes this look more like a champagne. Very attractive, especially with the sheets of lace left behind as I drink this.  S: Light and grainy with a delicate floral character and a combination of dry fruits and spice. While there are notes of apple, apricot and maybe peach, this is purely the fruit character but not the sweetness associated. Spicy with aromas of nutmeg. Everything is beautifully balanced, with no characteristic overpowering the other. Excellent.As it warms up, a little alcohol appears on the nose, adding another dimension to this beer.  T: The exceptional balance of the nose is replicated on the palate. Opening up mildly fruity with apples and pears before segueing into a mid palate that has a grainy sweetness with a mild lemon zest bitterness and ending long and glorious with a combination of spice (nutmeg again), bitterness and fruity character, this beer is fantastic! The nuance and balance is impeccable, no characteristic overpowers the other. In this regard, Duvel stands above every other imitator out there. I have a predilection for balanced beers, and this beer delivers on that front.  M: Heavier than one would expect from such a pale beer, the high carbonation both offsets this aspect, and enhances the fruit and spice character of the beer. Drying on the finish with spice and bitterness, this beer is remarkably refreshing  D: This is an exceptionally crafted beer, and that shows in the drinkability. I'm almost done, and I crave another",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Finishes with some malts and hops - wonderfully balanced. Leaves a sweet/sour flavor.  M: Great carbonation - fairly light. Super clean.  D: Amazingly so.

This Devil was poured to perfection by the waiter into a big, branded tulip glass. Big chunky foam on top. It looked so damn good, that the girls and boys on the nearby table (who were drinking swill) stared at me as if though they were mesmerized. That's one sexy beer!!  Smells a complexity of fruits, yeast and alcohol lurking behind. It's a really awesome smell that puts a smile in your face.  Sweetness from the malts and fruity tastes, bunch of yeast in there. More fruit again, and the relaxing, indulgent warmth of the alcohol.  Super crisp feel and very gentle in fact; kind of light. Like champagne with more bubbles and more taste.  This beer's incredible taste, looks etc., combined with the fact that it's pretty drink-friendly, make for a really deceptive beer. If you don't read the ABV in the bottle, well, you might just keep going until you die!! (or run out of money like I did)  Anyway, this beer is absolutely bonkers. You definitely have to try it.

Duvel has a champange-like richness to it that the carbonation enhances into by making it creamy and frothy. A really special beer that stands out among other beers within its style due to its complex rich, chewy texture balanced by a subtle biterness of Saaz and Styrian Golding hops. It's delicious.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

When poured you get the classic image of a beer is a glass. The carbonation was coming up from the bottom of the glass in a torrent - really pretty to watch. The foam is very persistent and you get very strong lacing all over the glass.  The smell to me is a little bit like bourbon upon first pouring and as it warms up I'm getting more hops and some wheat smells.  Taste is good and really too complex for me to sort out. Bitter at the first and at the end, with floral hops in the middle and just a hint of alcohol.  Mouthfeel - heavily carbonated and bubbly on the tongue. Spicy almost.

I took heed, but still got a massive 3 finger head that stands over the top of the glass. It took me a long long time to finish pouring all the rest into my snifter. Visually there is lots of activity. Little bubbles rush up the sides to join their brethren in the massive riot that is the head. Color is a light straw, slightly clouded by yeast. The lacing is out of control.  S- The smell is very Belgian mixed with floral hops. It reminds me of some pale wheat ales Ive had, only better. Im detecting some grainy pale malts and floral hoppiness. Some light fruits like apples.  T- The head finally went down just enough for me to actually drink some of this...Here goes... Unlike anything else Ive gotten to try. Smooth, yeasty and grainy up front, the middle is really juicy and fruity. Its like eating an apple. Slight hop bitterness in the finish but this beer is really balanced, leaning more toward sweet and juicy. Each sip finishes so clean there is almost no trace of any flavors left.  M- Thin mouthfeel with plenty of carbonation. Slightly dry, very crisp and very refreshing.  D- WOW. Sooo drinkable. Nothing harsh about this beer anywhere.

It seemed a tad like wine and it seemed as if I could taste some green grapes in their with the yeast funk that reminded me of a very very laid back lambic.

222,695,bamadog,3.83,"I've had this one in the fridge for a while now and I've been excited to try it, so here goes. Poured from one of the funkiest little bottles I've ever seen into a tulip.  Appearance: Pours a very pale, light yellow straw-like color with a massive three finger head that is so fluffy that it looks like a merengue with incredible retention (seriously, the retention is so strong that I almost want to deduct points because it's making me wait so long to actually sip this beer); body is suprisingly clear and shows super strong carbonation;  Smell: An interesting smell emanates from my glass, as I definitely pick up a strong presence of yeast, but there is something very grainy and familiar about it as well so as I read the bottle, I see it is brewed with pilsener malts, so it all falls into place as it is very reminiscent of a pilsner in scent; light fruity esters that are a bit like apple, but a hint smoother and don't seem quite as acidic; and light notes of spices as well.  Taste: Yeast, a bit of a grassy and bitter hop presence as well; very grainy malt presence; very subdued spice notes. Not as rich as I would have expected and the spices are definitely downplayed -- much more of a bitter and earthy presence. It's still quite good, just not what I was expecting. Aftertaste is especially bitter and the alcohol becomes more of a presence as it warms.  Mouthfeel: Full of carbonation, a slightly drying effect on the roof of the mouth in the back and slight stickiness over the rest; belly is warmed quite nicely from the alcohol.  Drinkability: It's not too bad, I guess I have found a preference for other Belgians though that don't have quite the bitter preference. It's got a nice flavor and a beautiful appearance, but the ABV is a bit high for too many of these in a row, plus, it's a bit on the pricey side.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Easily the best tasting Belgian I have had.  The mouthfeel is a perfect medium body with a smooth, creamy feel. The beer touches your tongue in the most perfect ways.

222,695,MeisterBurger,4.35,"Pours like liquid gold, with a generous white, foamy head that was born to lace. Looks fantastic.  Smells of biscuity malt and fruity esters, grassy hops and very mild citrus.  The nose is well reflected in the taste. This does not taste like an 8.1% ABV beer at all, the alcohol is masterfully hidden. It's crisp, fresh and lemony-orange hops with a dry finish. It has that musty Belgian yestiiness that, love it or hate it, works really well with everything that is going on in this beer. There's a slight pepperiness in the aftertaste.  The mouthfeel is very crisp yet smooth and velvety. It's a joy to drink.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,endovelico,4.5,"Poured into a slinder Baloon glass. Best before date: 08/2011. Taken from notes. Reviewed under medium low artificial light.  Appearance: Forms a four thinger rocky white head. Semi hazy yellow brew. High perceived effervescence. Excellent head retention given that the head lasts thourought. Thick cap. The lacing is also excellent, being composed of big thick patches and rings of foam scattered around the glass.  Aroma: Foreground is mostly Malt and a Alcoholic zing. On the background there is Banana and slight spiciness from the Yeast esters. Well balanced, could use a little more spiciness on the nose to be honest.  Taste: Malt sweetness, Banana, bubblegum, slight spiciness which meshes well with the slight alcohol zing. Saaz like hop spaciness and flavour. Orange peel?  Palate: Medium to Medium High Bitterness. Medium to Medium light Body. Medium carbonation. Clean Finish, with lingering Btterness from the hops.  Drinkability: Well balanced overall with the spiciness from the hops and Yeast bi-products masking well the high ABV of the brew. Fits the style guidelines. Its also very light bodied and easy to drink if you take into account the ABV.  On a final note: A legendary beer, what can i say?",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Sherbet-y malts with ginger juice-type zest but also vanilla notes at the back. Big interplay between sweet and spicy. Hops open with more flowers and anise on the finish, with a burst of sour. Lively, with very creamy mouthfeel. ABV is there but doesn't burn, considering how high it is.  Understandably, a classic. But take it slow!   2nd tasting: Bright gold with rocky white carpet that laces; pear + yellow apple esters, sweet grain, + flowers; sweet crackery grain, waxy yellow apples + lemon peel, mild pepper, nettle + lemon balm hops; snappy + lively.  Great nose - low pepper tells you it's not a tripel. Hops play more herbal than spicy to me, though I'm assuming that white pepper is phenols (note: it can also be Styrian Goldings, which is a Fuggles descendent; think TT Landlord hopping.)

This head never fully drops and leaves wonderful sticky spots oon the side of the glass. The body is a clean, golden color with pleanty of heavy carbonation rushing toward the surface.  S- Duvel's aroma has always reminded me green apple. There's a pleasant mustiness, a hint of alcohol, and mix of spices (maybe a touch of black pepper in there).  T- More of that great combination of fruit and spice suggested by the aroma. There's more green apple and pepper along with a touch of alcohol. It finishes clean and dry.  M- It leaves a very dry feel in the mouth. There's a good prick on the tongue that I'd attribute to a combination of hopping, high carbonation levels, and relatively high ABV.  D- This beer is just so good. Whenever I drink this beer, I feel like reaching for another. Drinker beware: The alcohol can easily sneak up on you.  Overall: There are very few beers that I associate with the ""face"" of a style. Duvel is what I think of when somebody mentions a Belgian Strong Pale (or Golden) Ale. Everything I drink in that category, I find myself comparing to this beer. It's hard for me to think of a way to improve this beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Tiny little bubbles that fizz and massage the tongue. Biscuity malts up front in the taste with some nice sweetness. I taste a lot of barnyard funk to this. A bit of wet hay and horse blanket.

Tastes sweet up front quickly turning to a dry, bitter finish. The bitterness has a medicinal quality to it, but in a nice way. Alcohol is noticeable, but balances nicely with the other flavours.  The lively carbonation lends a pleasant texture to this beer.  The well balanced alcohol is deadly. I can feel this one bottle going to my head already, but the alcohol is so well balanced I could easily see myself having one to many. This beer is extremely easy to drink.

222,695,GrimGuzzler,3.96,"Poured out of bottle into a pint glass  A: Depending on light, the beer varies from rusty gold to a pale yellow. The first thing I notice is a large foamy head, very sticky and clumpy. Eventually this fades and turns into patchy bits and dollops of foam. Enough lacing to make the glass look good.  S: Hints of apple, pear, and crisp fruit are followed by some alcohol and wheaty yeast.  T: Very true to the style, crisp and mildly hoppy. There is a presence of alcohol, but it's subtle and perks up the taste buds a bit. Hence, this would be enjoyable with certain foods.  M: Effervescent, bubbly, and very carbonated. It keeps the beer interesting and exciting in the mouth, however I wouldn't mind it being smoother.  D: Very drinkable, so you have to be careful because the 8%abv adds up after time.  Over all, it's a great beer. Balance is the key word here. My two criticisms are that it's a bit too spirity and the alcohol could be masked more, and personally, just a tad less carbonation would have been nice.

Smell of very fresh hops in something that promises to be potent. As I TRY to pour the rest of the beer, here we go again. Head out the yin-yang. Am I ever going to DRINK this beer? Finally, the taste. Not impressed. Very weak. Can taste the massive carbonation as if it was campaign, not beer. No aftertaste at all. Very fresh.

222,695,damienblack,4.46,"The appearance is the greatest attribute of this classic. Pours like a typical Belgian Pale, straw-gold with some mysterious haziness. Absolutely huge billowey head, fills perfectly the Duvel tulip when poured from a 33cl bottle. Like thick merengue, you just want to put your head down and use it as a pillow. Even when all the beer is gone, there is still a swirl of head fluff in the center of the bottom of the glass. Leaves very neat lacing.This is the definition of what a great beer should look like. Smell is typical yeasty Belgian, sweet candi sugar, fresh malts and some healthy pale hops.  Taste is representative of what one comes to love about the style. Slightly sweet, crisp, a little off-dry, but very clean and refreshing. Mouthfeel is vivid, appropriately carbonated. Drinkability... this is one of the most drinkable beers out there, period.

The sweet tones are the strongest up front when tasting, and then everything else backs it up from the smells. Some bitter hops are also nicely detected to add to the complexity.  Overall well balanced and lots of flavors in the taste that you would presume that you get from the smell. Medium to full body as you would expect. Each sip needs to be taken in, definitely not a fast beer as it is strong but doesn't hint at too much ABV.  Smooth, tasty, and easy going for this much alcohol.

Thoroughly Belgian.  Taste: Intense. Lots of fruit (mainly apples and light citrus), bready yeast, and spices (pepper and clove). All of this over a tasty pale malt backbone. That over eight-percent alcohol content is there, but it's masked remarkably well and what does manifest itself is nothing but complimentary to the rest of the flavors. The aftertaste is complex, with many of the bready and spicy flavors in full effect.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and creamy with a terrific carbonation and occasional hints of alcohol. Dries a little in the finish.  Drinkability: Certainly more drinkable than the alcohol content would suggest, this is surprisingly quaffable.

222,695,eat,3.85,"02-02-2010  Alright...Duvel has been one of my biggest disappointments so far in my reviewing of beers. Definitely the biggest ratio of widely respected-to-I didn't think it was that great. I originally gave it a 3.6, which isn't a terrible review but is considerably less than average. Glassware choice may have been an issue. I don't remember what I used but I didn't have anything appropriate at the time. This time around I'm using a Maudite tulip, which is very similar in design to the proper Duvel tulip. I'm really hoping I was wrong last time, maybe it was an off bottle.  Pours almost clear and light golden yellow in colour. Decent airy, slightly rocky head which fades to the thinnest patchy covering. Some lacing though.  Smells like a ton of yeast, some light lemon and hops, a little grain and sweetness. Mostly smells of yeast. There isn't a lot of smell coming off it.  Astringent/acidic, slight hops, yeast, grain. It almost feels like it's going to upset my stomach; like it's part vinegar or something. It has a very strange quality to it. Dry finish. Pretty smooth for 8.5%, I'm not feeling it at all. I'll up the score to 4.0. There's something about this that's a bit indescribable.  This has one of the most prickly, lively mouthfeels I've ever experienced in a beer. It actually kind of reminds me of San Pellegrino (yes, the sparkling mineral water). That isn't an insult though, I love the feel of San Pellegrino. But it's weird at the same time, I don't quite know what to make of it.  So I think I can see how a lot of people are into this. For me it's a little uninteresting though. It's definitely not bad, I just wouldn't put it in the same category as the best beers I've had. I would gladly drink Duvel if it were free but won't be buying this again.  Old Review (05-26-2009):  Huge head (maybe I poured a little too quickly), settling down to a decent layer of foam that stuck around until the end. Really light color; I was expecting it to be a little darker but it's a murky, pale golden yellow. Not a bad looking beer. A little bit of lacing. 3.5  The smell is acidic, metalic, mildly spicy, a little yeasty. It doesn't smell bad but doesn't really smell good; pretty neutral. 3.5  I was expecting more taste than this, it's a little bland. It doesn't taste bad it just doesn't taste like much for my taste. Kind of like a light tasting white beer. Mostly tastes like the smell; an acidic bite, mild spice flavour, thin tasting though not bad tasting. 3.5  The mouthfeel is nice, thicker than the taste would leave you expecting. Good carbonation. 4.0  I don't know if I just had a bad bottle or what. I bought this today after reading all these great reviews but can't say I feel the same way. I definitely didn't think it was bad, I just really wasn't blown away at all. I do remember having this last year once and feeling the same way about it, mostly indifferent. I kind of feel like I'm missing out...what am I missing here? 4.0",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,Stavage,4.06,"Pours with perhaps the foamiest head I've ever seen on a beer. I poured the beer into my Duvel tulip slowly and carefully and still got a massive head. Colour was a slightly cloudy amber. Right in the centre of the bottom of the glass there was a very noticeable jet of bubbles winding its way up to the top of the liquid. As I drank the head became a complex foamy landscape and well...what can I say, not only did the head last until the last drop, it outlasted the last drop. I still had half a finger of thick foamy white head at the bottom of the tulip after all the amber liquid had gone. Amazing!  Smell really did remind me of champagne but with added malt complexity.  Taking a sip at first a complex malty estery taste hits me, but not a particularly sweet taste, then a flash of noticeable alcohol before a big bitter finish. Aftertaste is mostly malt and yeast, particularly towards the end. The bitterness is almost too much for me but I get used to it. It's not the floral hops bitterness that I'm used to. Almost reminds me of rind coming to think of it. The bitterness sensation lingers a long time.  The carbonation is fairly lively and also long lasting. It's a very 'natural' carbonation like you get with sparking wines. There's a kind of smoothness and creaminess thanks to the head but otherwise a kind of rough alcoholic bite. Fairly dry.  It's definitely a sipping beer. I think one bottle would always be enough at a time for me though.  Enjoyed this beer very much. I feel it's a drink that would grow on me even more as I get used to its particular bitterness.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,mhatters,4.67,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle into, fittingly, a Duvel glass, at my house  Pours a golden straw color with an immense white, foamy head that sticks around. Great lacing on the glass.  A lot in the nose - some citrus, some clove and other spice, a bit of the yeast and a great overall sharpness that is almost unique to this beer.  Flavor has the yeastiness, spiciness, citrus and some light fruit. Sharp and tart.  Good carbonation, great mouthfeel.  I can, and have, consume this all day, the alcohol is almost non-apparent, this is a classic beer, and it can be enjoyed anywhere any time.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,SingleCell,4.75,"Poured into a stubby tulip glass at cellar temp. Best before: Sept. 2011.  A: Very impressive looking beer. Very rocky clean full 2 inch head which had great retention. A pale straw coloured beer with noticeable carbonation constantly feeding that massive head.  S: Very sweet, malt and hop flavours are perfectly balanced in the nose. Bready Belgian yeast is also a major player in the nose of this beer. Behind is a slight alcohol presence as well as freshly baked biscuits/white bread, and surprisingly a bit of bubblegum which I would expect to find in a Hefeweizen or Weizenbock.  T: Up front there was alot more hops then I expected. The hops were slightly bitter. Strong malt backbone and just a hint of that bubblegum I previously mentioned. Also, again, that sweet bready belgian yeast. Behind all of these well balanced flavours there is a very distinct estery taste (mostly apples).  M: Light body with very heavy carbonation. Every sip leads to a very foamy light, crisp and ever so slightly dry mouthfeel. No complaints in this department, its spot on.  D: Very drinkable for a Belgian strong pale ale. Although alcohol can be detected in the nose it is nowhere to be found elsewhere.  Overall an excellent beer, truly the best of the style. I'll be picking up more of this beer wherever I can find it.

222,695,ChopperSmith,4.7,"Duvel, how do I love thee? Let me count thy ways...  Presentation: Poured from a 750ml bottle into a Duvel tulip glass.  Appearance - Cloudy golden color with a thick creamy head, excellent retention and beautiful lacing in the Duvel tulip glass. Head forms a nice peak as it slowly shrinks. Gorgeous!  Smell - Fantastic. Fruit, cloves and yeasty, yeasty, yeasty.  Taste - Yeasty, fruity and just the right hint of spiciness and hops all at the same time. Quite possibly the most consistently delicious beer on the planet.  Mouthfeel - Smooth, slippery and almost creamy.  Drinkability - Oh man, I could down these all day long...and I have! This is easily one of the most drinkable Belgian Strong Pale Ales out there. It is the gold standard for all others. This is always my go-to beer whenever I can get it while I'm out, and I always keep some on hand at home.

The smell was a bit dull, some yeast, and a bit of a pair flavor.  The taste was a bit tangy. Toasted pale malts some corn feel with a bit of a Belgian flavor.  This beer was a nice champagne type beer that seems to have a bit of carbination but did not leave the palete to overwelmed.

Taste - Bubbles of sugar and spiciness all at the same time. Notes of fruit and grain. Fantastic!  Mouthfeel - almost creamy.  Drinkability - It's not one of the best beers on the planet for nothing. If you think you know a lot about beer but haven't had Duvel, stop and enjoy a pint right now. Your education (and enjoyment) level will increase to the nth degree.

222,695,mjl21,4.53,"750 ml bottle poured into a Chimay glass. Best before 05/2011. Comes in at 8.5%.  A-Fairly clear golden color with tons of bubbles shooting up from the bottom. The signature massive head is in full effect. Off a careful pour I still get a big two finger white head full of different layers. The head eventually reduces in size, but is still larger than most beers on the market.  S-A subtle nose. Yeast is the predominant aroma, along with clean malt and fruits such as apple and banana.  T-The yeasty flavor is very pronounced. The fruits really come into play in the middle giving it a nice sweet touch. As it goes down there is a nice peppery bite. As I work through the glass I pick up on sour notes, some nice bitterness from the hops, and the perfect amount of warming alcohol.  M-Superb level of crisp carbonation, reminiscent of a good dry champagne. The foamy head gives this a smooth mouthfeel.  D-A very refreshing beer. The higher abv limits this one from being a perfect 5.  A true classic that somehow always ends up in my shopping cart when I go to Trader Joes. It works great as a year round beer.

222,695,sweetbrew82,4.36,"750 ML into a snifter/ Best by date of 07/2011  P: Crystal clear yellowish gold with a huge, healthy head of white foam. One of the most awesome crowns in existence! This thing is dense, rocky, and looks like sea foam as its perched atop the body for what seems like an eternity. Upon settling, it plasters the side of the glass with ultra-sticky foam. Wow!  A: Smells of toasty malts, fresh bananas and pears, peppery yeast, and a hint of alcohol.  T: Toasted pale malts are slightly grainy with a very warm & inviting, sensual kind of feel to them that massages the tongue into a trance. Fruits are bountiful, but stay very compact and tightly organized to deliver strategic hits of flavors that consist of bananas, apples, and pears. White pepper spices things up with a yeasty kick on the back end. Delicious!  M: Medium-full bodied with a volumizing carbonation that expands in the mouth to give a rich, creamy feel. Maybe the best mouthfeel for a BSPA that I've come across yet.  Notes: This is definitely the gold standard for which BSPA's should be measured. Having had this several times before, but reviewing it for the first time here, I can say that this one deserves all of the accolades it receives. Also, one of the best values out there. $9 for a 750, yes please!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,himmelhuber,3.41,"Pours golden in the glass with a widely pored semi stable head. Does not smell like much. Taste a bit sweet nearly like Radler. Nice esters and subtle maltiness. The only problem I have with this beer is that for 8.5 % alcohol is feels a bit thin what makes it really drinkable, but with this alcohol content you can't really drink a lot of it (thats why only 2.5 for drinkability). The high OG that this beer has does in my opinion not really contribute to its complexity. Anyhow, good but dangerous beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,MVotter,4.85,"Aroma from the opening of the bottle: spices, clove, some yeast  Aroma after the pour: breads and yeast.  I poured the Duvel down the middle of a tall pils glass (ignoring the instructions on the label of the classic pudgy bottle). It produced a white head as tall as the glass itself! After a minute, it was still four fingers tall and the body of the beer was a foggy light gold.  The second pour was per instructions ... hehe.  Wow! This Belgian is so effervescent that it is reminiscent of champagne. If poured down the side be ready for an explosion of bubbles in your mouth. It all depends upon which experience you prefer.  The taste is a blessed union of malts and hops, with a clove-spice finish. Incredibly delicious.  The mouthfeel was alluded to earlier in this review ... note there is a vast difference in the experience with the pour.  It goes without saying that the drinkability of this Belgian is off the charts ... beware however, the abv is 8.5% and it will own you.  As for the Strong Belgian Pale Ales ...

It's alive!!!  S- Wheaty and flowery smell. Yeast.  T- Clean, crisp wheaty malt flavor. Hint of overripe banana. Light hop bitterness. I can't really taste the alcohol until it goes down. Light aftertaste.  M- All of the carbonation is like a massage for the mouth and throat. Warmness on the tongue from the alcohol. A bit of a drying effect on the tongue as well. Very unique.  D- The taste allows this to be quite drinkable. However, the alcohol makes you take your time with this one.  Not my favorite style of beer, so I am probably not able to appreciate this as much as others may.

Light in smell overall. Taste is wonderfully pungent, with grain, malt, and some fruit-like flavors. Good cut on the palate... I think this would go very well with food. Mouthfeel is great. It's light but full of flavor. Drinkability is also great.

A nice one-inch head slowly subsided to a quarter-inch ring with a thick ring of lace. Tiny bubbles slowly fight their way to the top. Sheets of lacing cover the glass as I drink. Impressive.  It has a very faint but pleasant aroma. Sweet grainy smell, a hint of yeast. None of the 8.5%ABV comes through in the smell.  Crisp sweet flavor. A mild tartness at the swallow with some earthy hops peeking in to make their presence known. A touch of yeast.  Finishes clean on my palate with a bit of dryness. My mouth can't get enough of this one. The flavor is so light and refreshing that it is deceiving. Alcohol is very well-hidden.

Champagne carbonation trails and a big white head that leaves a lasting layer of foam. Very pilsener like aroma, with saaz and pale malt, but an amazing tart citrus and pear character blends in too. Fruity sweet and tart all the same, with yeast and alcohol following. Elegant hop balance keeps it from being cloying. The body is suprisingly light and delicate for a beer this strong.

222,695,Buschyfor3,4.48,"Poured from the classic, stubby 11.2oz Duvel glass into my new Duvel tulip (got it in a Duvel gift set!)  A: Holy $&%@! Huge, billowy, bubbly, thick white head, literally half the glass is head (just like you see in publicity photos on their website and e-store). Best head I've ever had... literally. Lots of lacing clings to the side of the glass in web-like patches. This beer looks gorgeous.  S: Hugely sweet, spicy Belgian aroma - so decadent; faint fruit esters of juicy apple, pear, fresh-squeezed lemon; cloves, maybe some cinnamon and nutmeg; malt profile includes a hint of sweet, freshly baked bread, honey and toasted caramel/brown sugar. Fairly complex nose.  T: Apple and pear esters up front lead a burst of sweetness that is followed by a chorus of toasted malts and spicy-sweet cloves. Slightly peppery alcohol punch follows the malt background into the finish, which lingers on the tongue in the form of a slightly stale, yeasty bread flavor. The Belgian yeast flavor is also noticeable in the finish - slightly funky, peppery, but pleasant.  M: Medium carbonation; not as strong as other Belgian beers I have tried, but enough to give a slightly crisp edge.  D: 8.5% ABV, but as the Alstrom brothers note, the alcohol is devilishly powerful, and you don't realize it until its too late. Its presence is realized in the peppery flavors, but it doesn't grip you until the end of the bottle, and by then, its kicking your ass.  Wow. Last time I had a Duvel was roughly 6-8 months ago, and I don't remember it being this flavorful. Maybe my tastes have changes? Maybe I had a bad bottle then? I'm not sure, but what I know for certain now is that this is a killer brew and deservedly one of the best Belgians on the market. Bravo. Would definitely recommend and look forward to drinking the remaining three bottles.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

T- I like this... delicious blend of light fruit--apples, pears, lemons. Followed up with cloves and Belgian spiciness. Finishes with a nice alcohol punch. Malt really only comes in with the aftertaste, which is pleasant.  M- Well carbonated, light-medium bodied, with a dry finish.  D- Great.

Quite impressive, even in the sample glass.  Aroma was of bready malt and apples. Not sweet, like an apple cake. Quite pleasant.  Taste was of subdued bready malt, slightly bitter, with a smoky taste. A big surprise, given the aroma, but not unpleasant.  Mouthfeel was nicely carbonated, refreshing without being weighted down by the higher ABV. It was well masked.

The head is legendary. A foamy, soapy, rock of a stark white head. Like a giant soft pillow. The most incredible head of any beer, ever constructed. The lacing is great, as are the millions of tiny bubbles grooving their way up the sides.  Smell - Funky phenoms. Some real spice, but lots of that strange/wonderful medicine smell. A little lemon citrus, a little hint of clove. So sharp and crisp on the nose. Lovely.  Taste - Yum. Sweet bread, lots of spice, balanced by the citrus on the follow. Really nice tartness, green apples. Nice estery yeast action. Just a great taste.  Mouthfeel - One of my favorites. Lots of nice carbonation but somehow it isn't ""gassy"". It feels sharp and crisp in the mouth.  Drinkability - Very good. Goes down very smoothly for the amount of booze. Downright dangerous if you ask me.  One of my all-time favorite beers.

The esters and noble hops work wonders together as neither one drowns out the other. Subtlely complex throughout with some peppery alcohol in the finish.  M- Light and well carbonated.  D- It's easy to forget the 8.5% on this one.  Worthy of it's following, and being the standard by which all other strong pales are measured against.

222,695,biboergosum,4.3,"330ml squat bottle, into a Duvel chalice, at a pool hall, no less!  This beer pours a slightly hazy, very pale golden straw colour, with lots and lots and lots (and lots) of thick, puffy, and meringue-like white head, that takes forever and a day to melt away, to a little islet of creamy iceberg-like foam floating dead center in the glass.  It smells of soft, feathery bready pilsener malt, a bit of overripe lemon, sugary pineapple, duly restrained earthy yeast, and some floral and moderately zesty green hops. The taste is grainy pale malt - strongly hay-oriented - a touch of artisanal white bread, lemon and sour orange rind, apple skins, crackling yeast, pithy coriander, and a somewhat phenolic alcohol warming.  The carbonation is quite obviously on the high side, but in a lighter, effervescent sort of manner, in that the bubbles are much finer than yer usual deal, the body a decent medium-heavy weight for the style, and much smoother than it has any right being from the outset. It finishes off-dry, the semi-sweet bready malt, baker's yeast, and boozed-up fruit salad notes doing the honours.  Duvel is a progenitor of the style, for very good reason. Once past the aggravating opening theatrics, everything just goes so very smoothly for such an alcoholic pale ale, so much so that one might inadvisably be inclined to make a night of this.

S: Subtle yeast with hints of malt. I also detect sweet fruit notes, apples and pears.  T: Very much similar to the nose. Some yeast with a candy fruit backbone. Absolutely delicious. It is crisp with a dry finish.  M: The carbonation is the thing that really is apparent in this beer. It is very upfront and reminds me of champange.  D: Very drinkable considering the relatively high ABV. The carbonation practically begs you to have another sip.

Green apple is the taste that comes to mind when I sip this. The yeast is also here, giving a slight sour taste near the end of each sip. Mouthfeel is very crisp from the intense carbonation.

Not the boldest scents coming from this which is surprising. Some faint fruit off in the distance.  T- Improves upon the smell with more fruits coming through including banana and some apple and pears working well with each other. Belgian yeast blast through with some light hops sneaking through. Some freshly squeezed lemon thrown in as well.  M- A large step below medium bodied with a ton of carbonation which you can tell is there just by looking at it while it is heavy on the tounge.

D- I was not blown away by this but Duvel certainly is worthy of it's place within this style, of which I buy a lot of replica's of which do not compare. A bit high in alcohol which is O.K. by me but a tad to much carbonation.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,roscoehnj,4.41,Pours golden with an unmatched billowy cumulus cloud head into my duvel tulip. Pinprick bubbles rise much like a fine champagne.  Doughy yeast on the nose with hints of orange and bananas.  Tastes slighly sweet (but not too) woth lots of different fruit tastes to baffle the toungue. Beautiful mouthfeel with the right amont of carbonation and zing. The ultimate belgian pale for a reason.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Yimosan,4.32,"Poured from a bottle onto my Duvel branded tulip glass.  A: Hazy golden in color, with a snow white thick and foamy head. Nice lacing from the neck of my glass all the way to the bottom.  S: Citrus, sweet pineapple, and very faint nutmeg.  T: Initally you get sweet malt, then a citrusy Belgian wit tangyness hits your back palate in a really nice way. The alcohol is well hidden, which makes this a dangerous proposition.  D: Definitely, smooth mouthfeel and flavor, but it sneaks a punch here and there to remind you what you're drinking.  This was the first Belgian beer I ever had many many years ago, while visiting a friend in Brussels, and it not only became one of my favorites beers, but it made me curious about other Belgian styles.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,projectflam86,4.16,A- Poured ever so carefully into a snifter. Beautiful golden color with the most massive marshmallow/meringue foam I have ever seen. Lots of sticky lacing all the way down.  S- A yeasty malt nose with spices and some citrus scents. Sweet with a bit of alcohol.  T- Lots of spice and malt upfront. There are some sweet citrus ester tastes in the middle. Finishes with crisp clean bitterness of floral hops and alcohol grains. Light yeast flavors throughout.  M- Light and crisp with an enormous amount of carbonation.  D- Really nice brew that is highly drinkable (watch that ABV).,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,yemenmocha,4.8,"Champagne?  Pours beautiful bright light golden, transparent, with large bubbled white head that slowly dissipates into nice, thick dollops.  Nose is full of ripe, light fruits such as green apples, and maybe white grapes. There's a hint of vinegar too.  Palate offers Champagne like qualities of high carbonation, glorious ripe fruits, and a touch of esters. There's a touch of lemon-lime soda to it, almost like a cross between Sprite and a decent Champagne. Finish is somewhat sweet.  Spectacular beer!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Limenitis,2.6,"Maybe I have too many good local microbreweries with plenty of Belgians to choose from but I was utterly disappointed with this beer. I prefer a sweet Beligian, so maybe if you enjoy a tasteless, flavorless, non-descript Belgian ale, then this is definitely the beer for you. If you don't have local Belgians try Urthel before you try this. This beer is really WAY overrated on this website.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

The beer pours a light golden hue with a massive, massive, overflowing, lovely head. There aren't enough fingers on my hand to describe the rockiness of the head...impressive. The smell is rather light, a refreshing mix of candied fruits and some spices. The taste is similar to the nose in that it is light and refreshing. There are waves of new fruit flavors and other nice yeasty esters with every sip. The mouthfeel is perfect. High carbonation, just a bit of bittering, medium to light body...excellent. I could drink this beer all day long, it is just so light and refreshing, with the alcohol hidden so well. Excellent beer, definitely lives up to the hype surrounding it.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,Parrotshake,4.51,"Served lightly chilled out of a 750 bottle. Pours a very clear yellow colour with a massive bilious head, which recedes around the edges leaving a big marshmallow-looking lump in the middle. When the first glass empties out, about 3/4 of the inside is completely white with lacing.  Smells mineraly in the same way champagne does, citrus rinds, medicine (that iodine-y thing that Orval has), cut grass. Takes a bit of swirling to unlock the whole thing.  First mouthful feels big and creamy, then come layers of flavours. There's slight apples and pears, a big, tart white-wine-y kind of thing, more grass, a little wood (just a little) and more of that bitter iodine thing (in a pleasant way) - not hop bitterness, though that's there too, but herbal bitterness, like Jagermeister, for example - but all woven in nicely with the predominant spirituous and yeasty qualities that make you think ""Yeah, this is definitely Belgian"". If that makes sense.... I'm yet to pin down that particular characteristic in words. That's why I'm here, I guess.  Very refreshing, without being too carbonated. Super dry finish - your palate is cleansed after every sip, which adds to the drinkabilty immensely because you almost immediately want more - drinkability is off the scale.  The heat at the end of every couple of sips lets you know how boozy it is, but it won't take you long to eschew your responsibilities and continue to plumb the depths this beer offers. So overwhelmingly good you'll be hard pressed to stop.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

S- Scents of pears, spices, Belgian yeast, and a touch of honey-like sweetness.  T- Leads with a semi sweet pear/apple/ lemon taste. Mid palate is a touch of spice and yeast. After the finish I'm gettin a banana citrus type thing.  M- Clean smooth refreshing....Delicious!  D- This is a fanatically delicious beer.

The aroma is sweet and fruity from the yeast pheonols.  The taste is like golden nectar. Not as hot as one would thick with its high ABV. Good balance of malt, hops and yeast character.

222,695,ccrida,3.36,"THE BSPA. Which I apparently have never reviewed. Honestly, it never was my favorite, but I haven't had it in quite some time, and the ""buy a 4 pack and get a free tulip"" promo seemed like a good excuse to revisit this world classic.  33cl stubby, around 40-45F, poured into the famous Duvel tulip. This beer looks perfect. Clear gold, an eruption of bubbles streaming up from the etched ""D"" in the bottom center of the glass. Big pillowy white head, rock and slow settling, taller island of foam in the middle, while as the sides subside, it leaves heavy, foamy lace.  Smell is pils grain, table sugar, minerals (seltzer like), light herbal, grassy hops and fruity belgian esters. A pretty nice balance between it all, but not overly robust or exciting, even when I bury my nose in the glass.  Taste is still not my favorite, overly grainy and boozy for my taste in the style, where I prefer more esters. I've just always found it to simple and rough, and that is still the case. Even letting it warm up a good bit, the only thing that gained strength was the alcohol.  Mouthfeel is very crisp, a sharp if very fine (small bubbled carbonation).  Drinkability is ok. Just a strong and simple Belgian blonde in my book. The glass is by far the best thing about the whole package. While I appreciate it's good looks, the taste just doesn't do a lot for me, and I find it to be average at best. About as close to American lager as you can get in a Belgian Ale, taste wise.

222,695,Ralphus,4.8,"Duvel. It's hard to believe it has been a 15 year on and off relationship and I'm just now getting around to reviewing you. We were first introduced when my friends and I had met a Belgian guy over the internet in '95 or '96. Dom was his name he came to Canada with all sorts of magical beers.  We were young and we lived in the poorest province in Canada. But the odd thing was we had the fastest residential internet feed on the continent. It was strange times and we were meeting lots of stranger people. The majority of our beer was, unfortunately, quite terrible. Despite this we knew there was better to be had.. Michael Jackson's pocket book on beer promised as much. And while our friends drank local versions of Labatt and Molson products we had moved on, past the imports and into the then exciting Upper Canada microbrewery. When Duvel arrived by way of our strange traveler it was a bit like handing a laptop to a neanderthal. We recognized it was far superior - but didn't understand how it worked, how it was created nor why we liked it so much.  That magic however was short lived. Dom was just as young as we were and he only had a backpack to hold his beer and clothes. He shortly returned to his life and us to ours. When you are young interests can be fleeting and intermixed with dozens of others. And even though Duvel was out of sight, it was not out of mind. There was potential there that none of us would forget.  It was Duvel that kicked open the door to the world that Michael Jackson wrote about. A world of great beers, great understanding and great friends. And for that reason it will always remain in my mind as the best beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

I have to pour it very slowly because the head of this beer can get out of control quick. A full galss of Duvel is certainly one of the best sites to see, and has become the standard of how a Belgian ale should look, with it large flavorful head. The smell is very spicy. The taste is very crisp with a slight bite to it. This is a great beer to drink with dinner, especially my favorite, the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich at The Abbey in Providence.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

I had a chance to try it as a part of the first beer dinner - Belgian Beer Dinner - at Kindling. Due to the success of the event, I'm sure there will be more.  A: Big pour!! No matter how carefully I poured it produced a big, thick head. On a 6oz tasting glass it initially appeared to be 2oz beer and 4oz head. Once it balanced out a little you could see a brilliant yet cloudy gold.  S: Fruity pear, spicy cloves, and an earthiness to this (from the yeast, I guess).  T: The fruit tones and spiciness comes through in the taste. There is a hoppy crispness on the back edge.  M: Easy on the mouth. Dense body. Well balanced. Maybe a little too carbonated.  D: Found this to be very drinkable. The 8.5% ABV is well hidden. I think I waited too long to try this one.

222,695,nms1987,3.4,"From the bottle into my Duvel tulip.  Pilsnery gold. Fairly opaque though. I can barely see my finger on the other side. Big foam. A beautiful beer, despite my subpar pour  The nose is all wine and apples. The wine aspect is interesting. Some sniffs I'm getting sauvignon blanc, on others I'm getting cabernet.. wtf?  Dry apples on the taste, in a way that is not dissimilar to Unibroue Ephemere... despite the beers otherwise being much different. An elegant and crisp beer with good carbonation. I'm sure it could go great with a variety of food. I'm not really tasting any of the Saaz that is supposed to be in this stuff though.  Drinkability is low. I wouldn't have another and each sip must be taken carefully. Too big a gulp and you don't feel good, same as with a good wine.  EDIT-I enjoyed it less and less as the night went on. I've had and liked this beer before, but on this review it was just a little too much. I can't quite place what put me off aobut it.

Poured a slightly hazey golden color with a nice thick cap of foam that stuck around for a while; great lacing left behind on the glass.  Fruity pear-like aromas hit the nose on a fresh pour.

The head sticks around for quite a while, eventually settling into a cloud sitting on top of my beer, leaving thick lacing. It's been well documented but bears repeating, this is a great looking beer.  Smells of grassy hops with hints of apples and pears. There's also an earthy yeast aroma that pokes out every now and then.  Tastes different than it smells. Loads of booze-soaked pear flavors are joined by solid sweet malt flavors and green apples. There's a ton of nuance going on in this beer, and I could have five more and not completely figure it out.  Mouthfeel is good. It's got a smooth thickness with active carbonation.

Only minimal loss, about two swallows, off of this 750ml bottle, so, all is well.  This pours the most crystal clear, golden yellow tinted, honey color that I've ever seen in a glass. It has just the faintest hint of copperish/orange tones to it. Massive head of super-sticky loose white foam. Retention is amazing and so is the lacing. Very nice.  How about a nice glass of Belgian Yeast drink? Big yeasty nose. Not overdone or offensive, though. This one is most inviting. Nice hints of white fruits like peaches and apricots. Bananas and a touch of fresh figs. Slight hint of bubblegum. Some mild funk notes that remind me, oddly enough, of sandlewood. Never said that about a beer, before. Almost smells like a 'new age' bookstore, that also sells fruit (probably organic, I'd guess).  Well, I don't know why I've waited so long on this one. Okay, one reason is because it's not available in my area. But I've had this bottle downstairs for a couple of months, now. What have I been waiting for? Very tasty, I must say. Peaches, bananas, white grapes and green apples are rolling around in Belgian yeast. Clove is prominent, but not overbearing. Slight notes of orange peel. Nice earthy graininess.  Very clean feeling, while nicely creamy, at the same time. High level of carbonation, but it's those tiny little bubbles that this style is supposed to have. Very smooth and enjoyable.  Very drinkable, especially in warmer climates/seasons. The 8.5% ABV is very well masked.

Faintest hints of the alcohol but this is such an easy drinking beer that you would never guess the ABV. Only complaint is maybe it's too carbonated for easy drinking?

It settled into a broken film fed by the carb.  The aroma was a bid subdued. Green apple, lemon, corriander, yeast and alcohol. Sweet. What was there was good but really had to swirl to get it going. The taste was good but subtle as well. Starts out slow and then hits it stride but then had a slightly off aftertaste. Might need to re-sample this one at a later date since seems off in several areas.  Overall, a really good but not great beer.

The pour is a lighter shade of gold than I expected, but the tall white head is nice. It recedes ever so slowly (making it one of the nose-dippers!), and I had trouble seeing through the lacing because of the amount.  Fruits are the first aromas caught in the nose, especially apple, banana and orange. Spices and some woodsiness follow. The faintest smell is one of yeast. I don't notice anything of alcohol. The taste again starts with the fruits and adds more citrus, some lemon and grapefruit. The spices linger on the tongue for a while, certainly well after the sip is in my stomach. There is some, but not too much, bitterness present throughout. In addition, the alcohol is noticeable only if I take too much of a sip (which is hard to resist).  The beer is light-to-medium bodied with a large amount of carbonation. It is also one of the smoothest I have ever tasted. Drinkability is high, but again, taking too big of a sip reminds one just how much alcohol is present. I could definitely have a few.  I wish I didn't have a +/- 120 mile round trip just to be able to buy this beer.

222,695,StarlightSeraph,4.18,"Poured from an 11.2 oz bottle into my Duvel tulip.  Appearance: Gorgeous. Pours a slightly hazy golden-yellow, with a massive amount of white head. The head is four fingers thick, and dissipates at a glacial rate. As it does subside, it leaves blankets and blankets of lacing.  Smell: Muted notes of banana and pear, undercut by an almost woodsy note. Some honey notes. Some hops are noticeable, only to complement the dominant banana flavor.  Taste: A banana sweetness right off the tongue, backed by woodsy and some spicy notes. Favor fades to a mild hop bitterness, but some of the sweetness of the malt lingers well into the aftertaste. Very clean and crisp taking. There are no strong, overpowering flavors in this one, and each flavor is so delicate that this absolutely needs to warm up a little bit before drinking.  Mouthfeel: Thick, with prickly carbonation. The high carbonation keeps this one a sipper.  Drinkability: I'm torn on this one. It tastes outstanding, and the light flavors make me want to drink this quickly, but the prickly carbonation and high alcohol say otherwise. This beer would be almost perfect if it were lower in ABV/carbonation, making it easier to drink, or if the flavors were a bit more full. Regardless, this is an excellent beer, and one that I will likely constantly keep on hand.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,johnmichael712,4.88,"Appearance: Poured out of an 11.2 oz bottle into a tulip glass. Freshness date on the bottle is 05 2011. This beer pours a bright, translucent gold color that was perfectly clear until I swirled the last few drops in the bottle and added it so as the get the yeast into the glass. The head is a very bright white color and is supplemented by a steady torrent of small carbonation bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. I've said that heads have been soft and pillowy in the past, but the head of Duvel takes that one step further into a melted cream sort look that mimics the consistency of a dollop of cream atop a cup of coffee. The most amazing thing, however, is not only that the head maintains this consistency throughout the entire experience but it also maintains fabulous surface coverage all the way down and no gold is ever visible when looking straight down into the glass. It also leaves a huge amount of Belgian lace, and makes me pull the trigger on that five rating.  Smell: The nose of this beer showcases the significant fruity esters in the beer, with green apples, pears, and orange peel being the most prominent. There is also moderate clove spiciness in the nose that shouts ""Belgian yeast"", along with a very faint, musty hop aroma. There is also just the faintest hint of alcohol in the nose, but it's hard to say if it's really there or if I'm just making it up.  Taste: This beer begins with all the wonderful fruit esters that were present in the nose, green apples, pears, and bitter orange peel, but there is also a bit of lemon zest present in the flavor. This moves to a strong, peppery yeast flavor and spicy hoppiness that lingers on the palate for an absolute eternity, far beyond the extra dry finish. As this beer warms up to room temperature the spiciness and the hops become even more prominent, along with a hint of alcohol., and the flavor reaches new heights. I definitely recommend letting this one warm up a good amount before drinking.  Mouthfeel: Very highly carbonated, which is one of the trademarks of the style. Besides that, this beer has a very light, crisp body and a heavenly smoothness to it despite the carbonation and it's a real pleasure to drink this. Incredibly smooth, light, crisp, and effervescent.  Drinkability: This is one beer that I could drink all night long. As I mentioned in the mouthfeel it's incredibly crisp, dry, and smooth, and it has all the qualities of good champagne but with so much more complexity and flavor. Watch out, though, because this little guy is still 8.5%. They don't call it the devil for nothing.  Notes: To be honest I'm sad that I've waited this long to try such a highly touted brew. One of Michael Jackson's top five beers in the world, this is definitely something that everyone should get a taste of at least once in their lifetime. I'm so glad I bought it, but sad that I only got one bottle. I'll definitely be buying more in the future.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

I would definitely drink this one again if I saw it!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,taylorhamrick,4.23,"Pours an almost hazy, but mostly clear yellow/golden color, with a big, fluffy, white head. The head collapses, leaving a little lacing, and a thin puff of bubbles stays on top the whole time. The smell is nice. Powdery pilsener malts, some light sugary smells, but not a very intense sweetness. A very faint earthy spiciness from the noble hops. The taste comes across first with some nice pleasant pilsener malt. Then the noble hops kick in, with some minty, almost peppery spice with a nice earthy finish. There's a nice struggle between sweetness and dryness in the finish, and I enjoyed the battle. Very nice, right on, could maybe play more to some more raisiny, bready malts, but still a standard for taste I'd say. The carbonation is sharp on the tongue, which is kind of normal for a BSPA. The beer itself is kind of right on too, not too heavy/thick, or too light/thin. Good. The drinkability is good too. The alcohol warms a bit as you go on, but really you hardly notice it and this one can go down quick and easy.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,youngblood,4.68,"A - Liquid gold and not the excreted kind. This is a beautiful looking brew that has a cloud of head that sticks around nearly the entire experience. Lace sticks to the glass as it is consumed, continuing the beauty.  S- Very crisp. Slight apple (slightly sour?) and bready scents. Very clean smelling.  T - Wonderful. Alcohol is present but not overwhelming. Very clean taste, concise. You can taste all parts nearly equally (hops, malt, etc.) Perfectly put together.  M - Light and refreshing, rolls on the tongue similar to champagne.  D - I'd love to drink these all night, they go down that easily. I would pass out eventually.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,fullsweep,4,"330 mL bottle poured into a glass.  Thick white head of very large bubbles. Too much head to pour into the glass (probably poured too quickly). Head dissipates very slowly, leaving tons of lacing. Beer color is very pale, and cloudy.  Smells strong and Belgian, with yeast and alcohol coming through.  Taste is a tangy bittersweet mixture, but more sweet than bitter. Almost a slight sour taste. Alcohol comes through on the finish, and more so as I made my way down the glass.  Mouthfeel has a nice carbonation bite to it, more than any other beer I've tried.  Drinkability is moderate. It tastss great, but the highly ABV makes it more of a special occasion beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,brianlg,4.18,"750ml bottle. Pours a sunny yellow color with thick head. Very nice appearance, even though I do not own a tulip glass. Duvel smells very sweet, citrusy, and nutty. On the taste I definitely tastes nuts, and fruit. It is very sweet as the smell indicates. It has a medium mouthfeel I would say, and it goes down very well. I really enjoy this beer, but I would have trouble drinking a lot of this in one sitting. But I have nothing but good things to say about this beer. It is definitely highly praised for a reason.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,greengorilla,4.68,"I poured a 11.3 ounce bottle into a tulip glass. The pouring technique is important due to the incredible head. The appearance is pretty much perfect, if that is possible. The golden color with the thick white head in a tulip glass is wonderful.  The smell is strong and pleasant. The taste is the same. Not the best taste, but very good.  The mouthfeel is also exceptional. The natural carbonation fills your mouth.  This is a very drinkable beer for one or two bottles. The high alcohol content would keep me from drinking too many at once. Overall this is a great beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,ludachris,4.23,"Heard nothing but good things about this beer and have been meaning to try it for awhile now. Love the classic stubby bottle. Pours a really nice deeper golden colour with a lovely two finger creamy rocky white head that's there to stay. Amazing retention on this thing with some nice thick, patchy lacing. Smell of banana, citrus and spices with a hint of alcohol. Banana and citrus up front in the taste with some sort of medicinal taste that follows. Finishes off crisp and hoppy, but nothing overwhelming. Mouthfeel is clean, crisp and goes down without a problem. Duvel does a great job at disguising the 8.1% abv making this much more drinkable than expected.  Overall, an excellent beer that is both complex and well balanced. Love the fact that it's available at LCBO's all around here and will definately enjoy another soon.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,ThirdLap,4.51,"Small 330ml bottle served in the proper Duvel tulip. First sip took place after fifteen minutes out of the fridge.  A gentle pour results a bright gold body with a gorgeous two-finger-thick foamy white head. Tilting the glass coats it with thick foamy lacing.  The nose is lemony citrus and banana esters, malt, and the expected Belgian funk. Hints of alcohol.  There's so much going on with the first sip. It's sweet yet tangy, with a great balance of citrus and malt. The swallow reveals spices and a yeasty breadiness. Finish is delightfully clean and crisp.  Mouthfeel is creamy and best categorized as light to medium, which works very well with the huge carbonation. Alcohol is perceptible, but well-integrated considering the abv.  Drinkability is outstanding.  Beers like this always serve to remind me that the world of craft beer does not begin and end with huge IPAs and massive stouts. This is the ultimate Belgian Strong Pale, and one not to be missed.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,schellsbeer,2.32,"I first want to say...Sorry Keith...I tried to like this beer, I really did. I know it is one of your favorites. Anyway, here is my review.  Purchased last night because my buddy KeefD swears by the Belgian beers. I realize that he loves this style. However, I just can't get around the funk taste of them. Don't get me wrong, wonderful look and great mouthfeel but for a Russian Imperial Stout lover, just can't get past the ""feels like I am sucking on a field of really weird wildflowers"" taste. I realize that Belgium beers use different yeasts than American beers which is all good but just not for me. Great head and lacing.  As far as for saying this is one of the ""god of beers""....yeah, I don't think so. As far as for being a ""god of cute little wildflowers that tickle your nose beers""...this is more like it. Just my 2.7 cents worth. Take it or leave it...your choice.  As for future Belgium beers, will I be trying them....of course I will. It is all part of the BA adventure. Someday, it is my hope that I will find a ""famous"" Belgium beer that I do like. In the mean time, I will continue to love my Stouts, Porters, and IPAs.  The next adventure awaits...later.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,a10t2,4.43,"A: 330 mL brown ""stubby"" with best before date of 03/2011. On opening, the bottle slowly began to gush foam. The most careful pour I could manage resulted in a 20 oz glass being about half beer and half beautiful white foam with its justifiably famous lacing. Pale gold rather than yellow, with just a bit of haze being the only thing that knocked it to a 4.5.  S: Yeasty, typically Belgian aroma with quite a bit of funk, some fruitiness, and just a hint of alcohol. A little bit of sulphur that faded as time went on.  T: Very yeast-dominated, with substantial fruity esters. The aftertaste is where it really shines, as spiciness and bitterness from the hops come forward with sweet, warming alcohols that manage not to be harsh. If the yeast was just a little more in the background initially it would be perfect.  M: I want to take a bath in this beer. High carbonation means that it's down before you consciously think about it, and then you're left with a warming sensation from the back of the palate all the way into your stomach.  D: Good, given the amount of alcohol. There's a reason the Belgians have a reputation for doing strong ales better than anyone else.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,webmanspidey,4.3,"Light yellow, fizzy and champagne like appearance. So much head I can only pour so much into my chalice at a time. Sour green grapes are prevalent in the smell along with some yeastiness and cloves. The most prevalent taste is the sour green grape, but there are some other fruits in there as well. Very sweet and sticky, and as in the appearance, champagne like. Very carbonated and fizzy mouthfeel, but not very heavy at all. Extremely drinkable, doesn't taste this strong at all.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,tmoneyba,4.3,"Poured amber hazy hue with a huge rocky white head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Aroma was a heavy hop, light yeast and alcohol.

S: yeasty banana bread with lemon zest notes and spices. slight alcohol note as well  T: very balanced with light tangy fruits. very light and refreshing. how do they make a beer like this 8.1%? lovely malt backbone and nice snappy dry finish.  M: wonderfully light and fresh. carbonation helps the beer reach every taste bud in your mouth giving you a wonderful and complex aftertaste. Take a big swig and let it linger a bit.  D: they call this ""the devil"" for a reason! very drinkable yet wonderfully complex and flavorful. A beer legend and rightfully so.

222,695,thirdeye11,4.62,"Presentation: Poured from a small Duvel bottle into a Duvel tulip glass. The waitress told me it was a Duvel ""bell"" glass, but I told her that the BAs call it a tulip. Then she pointed out I was a guy drinking from a tulip. Touche.  A: This beer pours a huge 2-3 finger head that recedes quickly and leaves a nice lacing on the glass. The Duvel etching on the bottom constantly keeps this one with a thin head of bubbles on top of the beer which adds to the smell and taste. The color is a light golden yellow that I associate with lager-style beers and tripels.  S: Really great smells of pears and apples are right up front in the nose of this one for me. The beers aroma gets even more pronounced (in a good way) as it warms up in my glass.  T: One of the best BSPA I've ever had this beer is smooth, sweet, and highly carbonated which makes it a great palate cleanser and is quite refreshing. The only complaint I have for it at all is that its bitterness only slightly overpowers its sweetness and can linger. Not really a huge complaint though. This is one beer I love to let a non-beer friend or two that I'm drinking with try because no one I've ever handed this to has said they didn't like it. The taste of the pears was very evident to me last night as the beer warmed up, but not as much when it was cold. I might let this one sit longer the next time because I really enjoyed it as it warmed up.  M: Extremely carbonated, and almost too much so. I feel this beer has a near perfect weight to it.  D: Could drink it all night. None of the elements are overpowering, and 3-4 of these in a night is not beyond me. I absolutely love it.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Shadman,3.82,"If you wait for the head to disappear on this brew before drinking it you may want to take out a life insurance policy because you'll be waiting awhile. Hazy/cloudy straw yellow coloe. White as snow head. Great lacing.  Smell is sort of average to my nose. Fruity with a definite green apple characteristic. Certainly has that Belgain yeatiness to it as well as the smell of good old alcohol.  For such a strong beer it tasted quite nice. Big malts up front followed by a certain yeastiness. Hop prevalent in the middle and in the aftertaste. Alcohol warms up the palate and tongue in the finish along with a nice dryness. Oh, and as others have mention, watch out for the kick.  Considering how fizzy it was upon pouring, I thought it would be a lot more like champagne that beer. Thankfully it was not.  Certainly a well brewed beer and it lends to my ongoing joke about why the German's occupying Belgium probably got fat and lazy drinking this and others given the high ABV. Not a beer that everyone while enjoy, but a neat experience none-the-less.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,mmmbeer,4.36,"Stubby Belgian bottle; best by 05/2010. Brewed with Flemish water, French pilsner malt, Scottish yeast and Czech hops. Boiled for 1.5 hours, fermented with ale yeast, lagered for 3-4 weeks at 27° F, bottle-conditioned warm for 10 days, then cold-conditioned for six weeks at 41° F before leaving the brewery. Whew! This brew pours a bright, crystal-clear gold, with lots of beads of carbonation and three inches of beautiful head. I can tease the foam two-fingers above the rim of the glass, and it is as dense as meringue at the top, with fluffy froth below. There is a bit of haze at the end of the pour, and a huge amount of lacing on the glass. Smells sweetish, with subtle esters and traces of noble hops. It's a bit muted at first, but as it warms, it opens up and becomes more aromatic. The flavor has sweet pilsner malts that interplay with fruity alcohol and esters, lots of warming alcohol, flashes of spicy Saaz, and notes of banana and spice. Becomes more and more Belgian toward the end, with lingering hops and malt. Medium-light on the palate, nearly creamy, with a medium finish. Definitely a unique brew; each sip begins and ends like a pilsner, sandwiching spicy/fruity Belgian notes in the middle, making me want to call it a Belgian imperial pilsner. A one-of-a-kind beer that is in a class all its own. Definitely worth revisiting.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,ThreeWiseMen,4.41,"Ordered this at Spike's last night. Served in a Duvel snifter.  Appearance: HUGE 4-finger, pillowy, white head, piles up on top of a clear, golden body. After five or ten minutes, the head has only decayed a bit (maybe a half inch) around the sides of the glass, leaving a pillar of soapy bubbles standing in the middle. This is straight-up ridiculous. Turbulent carbonation feeds this massive head throughout the sesh. I don't really know what else to say... this beer is one of a kind.  Smell: Banana and clove are the main scents, and are accompanied by orange zest and spice.  Taste: Similar to the taste, but with more citrus and clove. Perfumy hops add to the taste as well. Banana still there. Alcohol kicks in at the end. Finishes sharp, dry and bitter.  Mouthfeel: Clean, crisp, and certainly dry. Certainly warm. Lots of carbonation. I like.  Drinkability: I'd love to have this again, and I'm sure I will. Not the most complex beer out there, but very balanced and fun. Carbonation provides for a lot of excitement in both look and feel. Flavors work well with the alcohol too. I could easily drink several of these.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,dakid618,4.38,"Poured from 11.2oz bottle(best before date on bottle: 04 2011) into chalice. Pours light golden, almost champagne colored, with tons of soapy head that fills the glass easily with a careful pour. The sides of the glass are covered in lacing from the head and a string of bubbles rises non stop around the glass. As I poured it I was strangely reminded of Busch beer in the scent. Upon letting it sit I get more banana like scents. Taste is surprisingly mellow with the same banana flavor as I got in the smell and Belgian yeasts. To me this tastes like a watered down tripel in a good way. Very similar in flavor to many of the tripels I've had lately but much smoother and more balanced. I've been slowly backing away from Belgian styles lately but this one makes me want more. A perfect example of a Belgian strong pale. Mouthfeel is a little tangy on the tongue and dry as you drink it but makes you want more as soon as you set the glass down. I have to say this is very drinkable for being 8.5 abv. I could definitely drink several of these despite the high alcohol content. I would strongly recommend this to anyone who hasn't had it.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Every pour results in a thick soapy white head that coats the side of the glass as you drink. The smell at first reminded me of a macro-brew. As it sat odors of yeast, banana, and alcohol are present. The taste is sweet with strong flavors of banana and yeast with little hop flavor. Carbonation is strong, but it is very drinkable.

It has a great pale orange color and a huge, foamy head that looks like it's been whipped. The head stays from start to finish and has heavy lacing all the way down.  The smell is intense and well balanced with citrus, a little spice, and then yeast.  The taste is also well balanced. A little bit of spice followed by orange and lemon flavors, then yeast.  Very crisp and refreshing in the mouth, with a slight alcohol presence. It finishes just a little dry.  This goes down exceptionally easy, especially considering the ABV.

After I pop the cap and confirm that all is clear, I twirl the bottle a bit to get the carbonation going and pour away.  A: At once welcoming and intimidating. The straw-colored golden body invites you to gulp away, while the foreboding massive head dares you to give it your best shot. The head eventually recedes but never fully dissipates even long after the last sip. In a word, majestic.  S: Aroma of noble hops with hints of lemon and grass. Reminiscent of a good Munich helles.  T: Starts off with crisp spicy hoppiness. Hints of pear in the middle. Bready maltiness kicks in and lingers to the end. Slight phenolic character in the finish.  M: Thanks to the carbonation, feels light and airy in the mouth. Has a drying effect on the palate. Both of these aspects make you want to keep on taking another sip.  D: To try to sum up this beer would exhaust my vocabulary of superlatives. Simply put, a world classic, and rightly so. An outstanding beer for just about any occasion.  Note: I drank my bottle after letting it warm up on the kitchen counter for about twenty minutes.

Large head if poured hastily, still a nice healthy head left behind from the Pilsner malt i presume if poured carefully.  Delicious aroma of orange, Belgian yeast and spices - coriander .  This beer has a great balance. It tastes refreshing, spicy, and hoppy. Basically everything you cannot find in a light American macro brew ie Bud / Miller etc. Dont let the light color fool you. I have enjoyed Blue Moon for a few years , but this is far more complex, and the orange is integrated into the beer as supposed to dropped into it the day you drink it.  I have to assume Allagash White is a tribute to this beer after tasting it and noticing striking similarities. Both are delicious",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Lacing is still on my glass, top to bottom, 5 minutes after I've finished.  S = Not a huge amount going on with the smell. Some sweet/sour fruitiness and a little alcohol.  T = Just an exceptionally well balanced experience. A nice subtle sweetness that evens out with some light bitterness and a little alcohol. Hard to pinpoint any exact flavors, but it all ""works"".

A: Lovely radiant gold with miles of thick, foamy head at first pour.  S: Yeasty, citrusy, fresh... like a field of freshly-cut hay.  T: Yeasts hit hard with strong notes of tulips, lemons, and hay. Pepper and other spices pique the tongue with a tingle and finishes slightly dry with more yeast. Alcohol flavor is a suggestion here.  M: Crispy, clean, and slightly effervescent on the palate.  D: Of course it's exceedingly drinkable. This is, for me, the quintessential Belgian Blonde.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,tpistilli,4.68,"Picked up a 750 ml of this Belgian deliciousness at the local Gristedes. Poured into a Duvel tulip that I figured was also necessary with purchase of such a beer. The bottle says ""pour unhurriedly"" and it wasn't joking. The head on this guy was ridiculous.  This poured a delightful golden straw color, almost opaque, with a fantastic, foamy, white, mountainous, and over zealous head that laced perfectly down the sides of the glass 'till the very bottom. There was plenty of lively carbonation that actually put me in a daze as it danced to the top of the brew. The smell was well balanced and appeasing to the nose. Citrus, wheat, malts and light spices were all evident; this is how I expect a true Belgian to smell. There was nothing overpowering, just welcoming. The mouth feel was beyond exceptional, very crisp with excellent carbonation, initial sweetness followed by a slightly bitter, yet satisfying finish. Perfect balance of flavors that tasted much like the nose. This beer is extremely drinkable. The only reason I give it a 4 is because of the alcohol content. A few of these may put you away for awhile. At 8.5abv, I might only be ale to do half a sixer of it, depending on my mood. Overall, a fantastic brew and probably on my list for top 3 Belgians. It certainly lived up to all of the hype.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Light and bubbly on the palate, with complex Saaz hops, lemon, pepper, and spice. Big yeast character, and perfect balance. Alcohol is perfectly integrated. Long, evolving finish. I gave this a 4.5 at first, but was so impressed by the end of the glass that I had to come back and give it a 5. So interesting and delicious. Too bad I only had one.  This beer is what so many others try (and fail) to be. The sophisticated way to brew an intensely flavorful, hoppy beer (as opposed to many of the ""extreme"" american brews).",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,everetends,3.91,"750 ml bottle I picked up in Cheers in Carrolton, GA. I have been dancing around a bottle of this for a while because . . . well, I always know it is going to be there and I pick up seasonals or limited release brews instead. Well, after Frank riding my ass for a couple months, I picked one up. Served up in a tulip glass.  A: Pours a really vibrant, straw colored, pilsner yellow. The show stopper is the friggin head. I don't give out fives on a regular basis but the head just blows me away. A very careful pour builds a huge multiple finger head that doesn't go away. As I let the beer sit for a moment, the head continued to build and reached a finger over the rim of the glass. This is the tightest, richest, foam I have experienced in a beer. The head almost resembles a creamy whipped cream at times when it is not disturbed. The lace is tight and incredibly sticky as it just sets on the glass and doesn't move. Its ridiculous actually. Just stupid. The carbonation doesn't stop in this beer, constantly and quickly rushing to the top an supporting the head. Really good looking brew.  S: The aroma that strikes you first is a really big belgian yeast character. There is a really nice lemon and orange zest and peel scent coming out of here. Then there is a touch of apple peel in here as well. There is also just that smell of a perfect pilsner. At times, it just smells like a simple but well done pilsner but it also has those Belgian characteristics.  T: Yet again the first thing that hits you is the Belgian yeast and character. Just that really nice earthiness that comes with that Belgian yeast. There is a nice presence of sour and juicy lemon along with the bitterness of the zest and skin. There is a touch of alcohol flavor in here, but it is really clean and light, kind of like a low alcohol and incredibly smooth vodka. There is a slight bit of metal coming out, but it isn't to crazy. The pilsner flavors are there as well, but just enough and mixes wonderfully with the other elements this beer has going on.  M: Light to medium in body with just a wonderful amount of heavy carbonation. This beer is very crisp and refreshing. Just so easy going down and incredibly light on the palate. The ABV doesn't have any burn on the palate or the throat. Just nicely controlled. Aftertaste is mostly some Belgian yeast and a touch of metal.  D: Very drinkable for a decent sized beer. This is a nice combination of flavors and beer styles. It just goes down so easyily and is nicely drinkable. The only problem is I could see the ABV catching up with you because it feels more like a pilsner rathe than a Belgian. Just very light and enjoyable. Sa it took so long to get around to it but I feel like I finally have an appreciation for a beer like this. Well done and just amazing.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,jdubjacket,4.11,"Being a beer advocate for this long and I've never had this before. Picked up a 4-pack of this, which came with a Duvel glass. Pours a golden color with a huge fluffy head. It's a cloud on top of a beer. Lacing stays on the side of the glass the whole beer and head retention is outstanding. There is a steady flow of carbonation coming from the bottom of the glass the whole time. Smell is belgian yeast with hints of sugar, candy and alcohol. Sweet, crisp taste that starts off sweet with sugar and evolves into a more bitter taste that has hints of seafood almost, but it is just subtle enough to be enjoyable and not disgusting. Despite the appearance, the beer is not overly carbonated and has a mouthfeel and drinkability. Overall, this is a great beer and I'm surprised I haven't had it yet.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

The aroma is fruity and pleasant; there's an extra bit of uniqueness that I can't quite pinpoint. Very nice though.  The taste is very clean, straightforward pilsner, but sweeter and more complex. It's light and crispy in the mouthfeel, but interesting to the bottom of the glass. A very interesting brew and incredibly drinkable.

Head was very long lasting with a lot of sticky lacing. A wonderful spicy aroma that can be picked up from a distance. The flavor follows where the aroma has led. The spice is the most noticeable, but is not overpowering. The secondary flavor is the unique yeast. A crisp, full body that leaves no aftertaste. Very drinkable, having several of these will make for a great evening. A true world classic.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,sonicdescent,4.12,Poured a nice gold with a bubbly white head.  Smells fruity and almost wine like. Very nice.  Taste is a very dry fruit taste and a biscuity flavor. Not as complex as a westy or bernardus but good no less.  Mouth is dry and thin with heavy carbonation.  Drinkability is good but I couldn't do too many of these in a row.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,bowersdm,4.21,"Poured an 11.2oz (I think) bottle into my Duvel tulip.  A - light golden color with no head...are you kidding me? The head was massive. half of the tulip was beer and the other half was head. I'd estimate 4-5cm of white pillowy head that actually seemed to get bigger instead of dissipating as time wore on. The most peculiar thing was when it finally did dissipate, a 2cm cylinder in the center of the glass (directly above the 'D' etched into the bottom) continued to rise until it eventually toppled over. The glass was left coated with layers of white foam.  S - yeast, some fruit, and what I think it lactic acid (it reminds me very much of Weihanstephaner 1809, the sour smell, that is.)  T - very low malt. there's a subtle spiciness throughout with noticeable fruity esters (apples, maybe bananas) and a hoppy finish with more fruit and spices. As the beer warms, a slight lactic acid sourness develops, but it's VERY slight.  M - I think the nucleation point in the glass (the 'D') helped adequately carbonate this beer because otherwise it would have been waaay too carbonated. it had a nice, crisp mouthfeel.  D - very easy drinking and the alcohol is hidden very well.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,UGADawgGuy,4.06,"Appearance -- Poured carefully into my Duvel tulip, this beer cannot be stopped from forming an absurdly massive, meringue-like head. This is the reason the Duvel tulip is so big: to contain that prodigious, snow-white foam. And it is beautiful indeed. Oh, and for the duration of the drink, the beer produces INSANE lacing. Actually, scratch that -- it's not just ""lacing."" In fact, it looks more like full-sized cumulus clouds clinging to my glass. Vigorous carbonation punctuates a pale golden liquid -- the color of some white wines. If I'd swirled the bottle's yeast into the glass, it would have clouded the beer; I've learned that I prefer Duvel without the sediment. At any rate, this is a BEAUTIFUL beer to look at.  Smell -- Again, I get kind of a white wine character, accented by fermented pears and something vaguely apple-like. In other words, the best single word I could use to describe Duvel's aroma is ""fruity,"" but that doesn't do it justice. There's also just enough of a hint of Belgian yeasty funk to let you know it's there. This is a truly unique-smelling beer.  Taste -- This beer defies categorization. In my mind it's in its own category. I've heard that there are other beers out there that mimic Duvel in some way, but I can't help but believe that any attempt at imitating this one would fail miserably. Such complexity...white grapes, powdery yeast, pears, mild apples, and a tiny, tiny hint of funk.  Mouthfeel -- Similar to a lot of German hefeweizens, with prickly, fine-bubbled carbonation and a light body. When I've had this with the yeast swirled and poured in, the resemblance to a hefeweizen is even stronger. Please note that I'm referring strictly to the mouthfeel when I say that; the flavors are altogether different. This beer enters the mouth and travels down the throat without coating or warming perceptibly. Clean, clean, clean.  Drinkability -- I've only ever had Duvel during ""sipping occasions,"" so it feels to me like a sipping beer. The 8.5% ABV isn't apparent by way of heat or astringency, yet your throat somehow lets you know that you can't guzzle this stuff down. As such, I hesitate to call the alcohol ""well-hidden,"" but it's certainly not in your face.  Highly recommended to all lovers of beer, Duvel is something you've just got to try at least once. Chances are, you'll be coming back for more.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,Stimack,4.25,"Poured to a nice golden color with a big, thick white head that has good retention and left nice sheets of lacing down the side of the glass. The first thing that the aroma brings to mind is yeast that gives off a nice fruit aroma, banana, apples and slight citrus. Also spicy smells waft out which are nice mixed with the hop aroma, Saaz? The flavor comes across as sweet at first from the malts then breaks to a mix of fruit (apple and/or pear) and spicy pepper. At the end the hop aroma identified in the nose comes out on the pallet and mixes extremely nicely with the carbonation levels. The 8.5% alcohol is so well hidden that even as it warms I am not really picking it up, just dynamic flavors that play together so well.

222,695,argock,3.39,"Poured from a 12oz brown bottle into an oversized wineglass. Freshness date on label. Single purchased from Wine Warehouse (Charlottesville, VA) for $3.45.  A: Unbelievable white head with easily the best retention of any beer -- I think it is actually growing bigger after pouring and sitting for a few minutes. The head's consistency is like frosting made of bubbles. The clear golden hue after careful decanting accentuates the active carbonation.  S: Tart green apple, sharp yeast, and noble hops aromas are most prominent.  T: The flavor, however, is a let-down. There is unique-good, unique-bad, and unique-and now I've tried it. Duvel fits category three. The flavor is of apple skins, breadiness, and noble hops. It's enjoyable but nothing otherworldly. There are at least 10 other Belgian ales I'd rather drink.  M: I did not enjoy the bubbly, champagne feel which was overly drying. The body is way too light for the style.  D: I can see why people like this beer -- there are few other beers with this refreshing combination of quenching tartness, light body, and beautiful, appealing appearance. I love the look of this beer, but the tartness and light, bubbly feel are a negative. I would rather drink La Fin du Monde, Maudite, St. Bernardus or Watou Tripel, or even Victory Golden Monkey anyday.  12/11/09: Trying an 8-month old version (best by 4/11 date).

The mouthfeel is soft and dry and quite nice, and the drinkability is really excellent, it's light and refreshing and doesn't feel like 8.5% at all.

222,695,Thesoundandthefury,3.9,"I saw a gift pack that had 4 duvels and a duvel glass and decided I couldn't pass it up and that now was the time to try it.  A- I poured the beer into the Duvel snifter class according to the directions on the back of the bottle. This produced a HUGE 4 finger head of tight, medium sized bubbles. As the head subsided, lacing was left all over the sides of the glass. Some of the best lacing i've ever seen.  S- Yeasty, some banana, spices, and a light sweetness all came through in the nose. There wasn't as much smell to this brew as I had expected.  T- Not knowing what to expect because I hadn't read over other reviews, I was a little shocked that there wasn't more complexity to this beer. At 8.5%, I was hoping for lots of different flavor layers. Very light tasting with banana and clove, almost reminded be of a hefe. A little bit of citrus in the mix, but it comes and goes without showing itself too much. The finish is slightly bitter, but in a good way.  M- Duvel is quite the carbonated beer if going on pour alone, but once I took a few sips, I realized that the carbonation doesn't come though as much in the mouthfeel. A bit thin feeling for 8.5%.  D- I could drink one, maybe 2, but there just isn't enough complexity to keep me interested much past that.

Also there is a hint of spice and faint fresh grass.  Taste: The taste is incredibly fresh and tartly fruity. There is pale malt here, possibly a mild trace of hops and some green apple and possibly bitter lemon.

Brilliant, bright clear golden straw capped by a billowing fluffy white cloud that hangs around until the end, leaving thick patches of stick on the glass.  Mild grass and fresh green apple in the nose, with just the very lightest hint of clove way in the background.  Light on the tongue yet still rich in body, with a nice bite of carbonation. Clean pale malt flavors combine with a faint hoppiness and slight touch of clove spiciness on the palate; alcohol is virtually undetectable until the beer warms, making this wash down as easily and refreshingly as a pilsner, finishing a bit dry and leaving one wanting for more.

Can I say it just smells special?  The pour takes well over a minute so as not to make the head get to such levels that it overflows. It still is three inches tall! Parts of the foam dissipate leaving taller bits that look like animal heads- or devil's horns. The beer itself is a perfect translucent gold.  The taste is quite dry, very little sugar to it. Up front one notices lemon, orange and a TON of spices. The hops, all from Bavaria, are moderate and citrus-y. The body is quite light for such a high alcohol content so near the end the alcohol note is very prominent and warms as it goes down.  This beer should be savored but golly, do I ever just drink it fast. it's just incredible. One imperial bottle isn't enough for me.  Note: I can't put it down. This is deserving of all praise. This beer has it's own personality. It's as if it is a living entity that does what it wants, not what you ask of it.  Once again, ""A true devil"" indeed.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,bonkers,4.23,I poured from a 750 ml bottle into a tulip glass. The beer pours a very clear yellow with an impressive white head. The aroma is spicy with phenolic notes. The flavor is sweet and spicy with alcohol notes throughout. The finish lingers with sweet alcohol. A light bodied beer that is easy drinking. Duvel is a great beer.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,ricke,4.48,"Serving date: 2009-01-26. Served in tulip.  Presentation: 330 ml bottle with freshness date on label (Best before September 2011). Some brief recommendations on serving temperature and pouring procedure on the label.  Appearance: A very pale golden yellow, basically totally clear as most of the yeast stayed in the bottle. Despite a gentle pour, the white head is enormous and rocky with big bubbles in the foam. Incredible head retention with big chunky lacings on the glass. The production of bubbles in the brew seems endless.  Smell: Lemon, ripe green apples and a distinct yeast aroma.  Taste: More lemon and fruit - mostly apples. Some sweet malts becomes present just for a little while. Then, a more sour fruitiness develops in tandem with some spices just before the finish. Here, a slight perfumy character becomes evident as well. The semi-dry finish is subtle but distinct with a nice mix of gentle bitter hops, more sour notes and a complementary sting from the alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Light body, but the head provides creamy foam to every sip more than halfway through the beer. The seemingly endless carbonation provides pleasant bubbles. All in all, a nice mouthfeel.  Drinkability: This beer is truly well-balanced, but still bold with fantastic flavors. However, I would say that it's in the drinkability department that this one truly excels: it just drinks very very well. Of course, the alcohol will sooner of later take its toll, but it should be noted that it's not before the very end that the taste of alcohol becomes prominent.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Smells of grassy earthness, spicy coriander, a nice sweetness with mild hop aroma in the background. Tastes spicy crisp up front followed by a medium sweetness followed quickly by carbonation and residual dryness. Tastes of lemon, white pepper and grassiness with a great balance of sweetness. Hops barely present. Great carbonation that lends to the dryness and crisp bite to the beer. Alcohol is ridiculously hidden.  A fantastic beer, truly reprentative of the style. Great balance is the key, too many belgian ales are boozy sweet.

M - Agree with the poster below. A champagne experience.  D - I'd seen many people mention this beer on the site.

I've never seen a head stay this thick this long.  S - Light, slightly Yuzu-like citrus, mostly hops and yeast  T - If refreshing had a specific taste, it would be this. A strong hoppy start mellowing into a clean pale ale taste, like a bitter citrus, before its amazingly clean finish. 'Kick ass' is the only appropriate description i can think of.  M - Screw That miller high life crap. THIS is the champagne of beers. The fizz is strong but pleasant, and the logic defying head adds a dimension of smoothness to its bite.  D - Absolutely dangerous. I don't taste the alcohol much, but the 8.5% goes right to your head. i could probably drink this 24/7, but I'd never be coherent again for the rest of my life. Best to stick to one or two drinks worth.  At first, I was skeptical of the high praise this beer has gotten, and I don't remember exactly enjoying it when I first tried it, but now that my tastes in beer have grown considerably, I can say that this one deserves all the hyperbole it gets.

222,695,jdense,4.5,"There's something to be said for any beer that inspires 100s of imiitators. Duvel is such a beer. Served from the classic caged corked big bottle into the stamped tulip glass, the amazing rocky head iis truly a sight to behold, and an important lesson for BA wannabes who think that the less head is better. Brilliant quite clear orange in color, with orange peel and coriander up-front, and a pretty significant alcohol aftertaste. Having tasted Duvel in the corked cage, 330ml and on cask, I must advocate for the big bottle, the bottle conditioning sets it apart from its brethren. For anyone looking towards gaining an appreciation for Belgium's weighty contribution to the world of brewing, this beer is an absolute must. Looking forward to cracking my stash open in about 6 months. The scary part is despite the high ABV, this is a very drinkable brew-very tasty!

Cloves, pepper are dominating. Nice usual wheat flavor there. Malty sweetness hiding there too with some apple peel.  T: Nice crisp taste. Pepper is strong, cloves being somewhat more hidden than in the smell. Wheat is stronger too. Yeast is there, as well as a nice and subtle hop bitterness. Very nice malt sweetness to end it. Alcohol is very well hidden.  M: Light, but still carbonation is high, giving the brew a nice crisp feel. Not watery at all, creamy-like feel to it too. Nice warmth at the end too.

T: Slightly soured apple, grape, and pear juice with a sharp yeast funk, touch of alcohol and a soft wash of hops.  M: Wickedly crisp and prickly.  D: Refreshing and delicious, a subtly complex beer.

M/D= Excites the taste buds with a smooth medium bodied feel. Very drinkable, could hit you faster than you would think because of the 8.5% ABV.  Notes: All in all a very crisp and refreshing beer.

222,695,Bootscraper,4.66,"I have never previously had the privilege of enjoying this infamous beer. When I saw a 4-pack gift set with the bulbous stemmed Duvel glass, I thought it was the perfect opportunity to take some home for a review. Served at around 52-54 degrees F into the Duvel glass listening to Devendra Banhart's ""Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon"". Cloudy, in some lights it shown a light gold, but mainly radiated a very very light yellow (almost off-white). Do I even need to describe the head? I mean, this pure white extremely pillowy behemoth towered several inches in length right up to the top of my glass, and was continuously fed by a stream of bubbles coming from an embossed ""D"" from the center of the bottom of the glass. I recommend even just chewing on a good wad of the foam for a tasty experience. The lacing was consistent, and there was still dried-up blocks of foam at the top of my glass when I finished the beer. The mellow smell was that of very rich, almost roasted, malt. But I also noticed little bit of wheat alongside it in there. It took me a good few minutes to specifically sort out the flavor going on here. But I decided: It tastes mildly of sweet malt and also of soft, flowery hops right away off the bit. As the sip concludes, the malt gets a little richer, but mainly those hops come out to play and also get bit more bitter. There is a nod of wheat throughout the sip as well and is left on it's own for a brief after-taste. On more acute level, the whole of the sip gets just a little bit pleasantly sour as it goes on. Finally, an alcohol taste finishes the story, but really only amounts to just a tiny warming... at most, it kicks up a slight pinch in the back of your throat, but that is my only real discrepancy... quite awesome really, considering the 8.5% ABV and all. It's also quite amazing how none of said flavors really overpower any of the others, and everything is true to a pale style of beer by being very mellow. Light, borderline medium, bodied... it starts off in the mouth very crisp like a refreshing pilsner. As your sip continues, it gets a bit chewy (this may be the first beer I have had where I can adequately pick out that adjective), especially if you get a sip with a bunch of that magnificent foam. It's pretty modestly carbonated as well, which says a lot considering that epic devil of a head that a bottle summoned. Also true to the style, there is nothing really harsh going on in the mouthfeel either, as this beer is only slightly sticky, yet hardly dry in any places at all. This beer is drinkable is fuck. My only concern is how well some of the subtle perfections might be coaxed, should this beer be poured into the ""improper"" glassware"". Overall, this beer really is not over-rated.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,tconboy,3.75,"Pours a clear straw gold with a nice dissipating head and moderate lacing. Smells a little skunky with some malt and spice. Flavors are a bit complex and blend pretty well, definitely a bitter aftertaste. Pretty light mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. This beer is much more impressive when considering the 8.5% abv. Overall a solid beer, and it's always a plus that you can find it at any local convenient store if your are in Belgium.. but if I'm there I'm drinking something else.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,talkinghatrack,3.95,"a - Light brown, nice foamy head. Too much foam, really. I do like the way it slims down into a little foam nugget with each glass, though. [Note: this is from my early fast pours]  s - Good but almost a little skunky until the head drops by 2/3. Then I finally get the spices and malts. Nice job hiding the alcohol notes - probably from the large head. I'm ranking this on its dropped-head smell.  t - Nice, complex malty and sour. Spices up front. Slightly bitter aftertaste pushes you to your next sip. No warming hits or rubbing alcohol notes for an 8.5% ABV.  m - A little malty but overall pretty thin  d - Given that I have to wait about ten minutes for the head to drop and can only pour a 1/3 full glass at a time, I have to factor that into the score. Taste-wise it's above average. Solid alcohol masking.  Not sure that I'm seeing the A+ that it gets here but let's see how my scores add up. I think it has to get a boost for masking its 8.5% pretty well even if it isn't top notch in other departments.  UPDATE: Wow. This is the first beer I've experienced where pouring style actually makes a considerable difference. I poured my third glass slow and easy and it really cuts down on the head while quite noticeably ramping up the carbonation. Pour it normally (1/2 tilted, 1/2 90-degree angle) and it foams up and tastes very flat. Pour it as directed and it's as bubbly as champagne. Very interesting. I think I prefer it somewhere in the middle.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Four finger white pillowy head that slowly fades down to a transparent golden body. Messy lacing with gobs of the massive head still clinging to the glass. Nose is a Duvel.. heh, smells as good as it always does, pilsner malts, belgian yeast, light hops. Taste is just that, slightly sweet and grassy, very carbonated, greatly balanced.

Farm smell hit me right after uncorking, which quickly dissipated and left behind some pleasant bready yeast and lemon. Tastes similar with pleasant - but not very strong - hoppy finish. Fine bubbled carbonation, and surprisingly velvety. Highly, highly drinkable, I'd gladly put away a few.  Overall: Refreshing quad that's well priced and quite attainable.

As it slows down the head gets smoother, creamier.  s- tart citrus of lemon, orange zest, a little banana sweetness. bready malts. overhanging slight smell of an over light-exposed beer, but it could be my imagination.  t- banana up front with a strong lemon juice sourness. bready in the middle and through the finish with a little fruit sweetness. Nothing incredibly complex here, but not bad either. The sourness comes on a bit too strong for me.  m- creamy, but with near champange like levels of carbonation. this is fairly pleasing.  d- this beer is just a tad bit too tart for my liking. some of what it's got is good, but I can't really get all that into it. maybe just not my thing. It's not bad, just not what I'd usually choose to drink.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,bluesoul,3.94,"A - Mea culpa, being rather new to the field of beer and without all the requisite glassware, this Duvel was poured into a standard 16 oz. pint glass. This, of course, did not work as a full four finger-high head of foam with a look and consistency of white meringue hit the rim before I was even done pouring, so I let it sit for a few minutes and got the other 3 oz. or so in there. It really is a thing of beauty, a nice gold though opaque for me as I found out about the yeast all too late, and superb lacing, leaving bands down the glass.  S - Slightly sweet but with a pretty strong malt note as if to signal you're about to drink a big beer. I don't think I'd have been confident enough in the banana note to mention it without seeing the other citations of it on here so it's here but I wouldn't call it in the forefront. Rather nice.  T - I've gotta say it's slightly tart, and I can't pick much out in particular except the alcohol hitting the back of the throat on the finish, a byproduct of the above-average ABV. It's rather dry, like a champagne almost. Finish is very clean (dry) with no bitterness to speak of, just that slight alcohol tinge that I'd wager you'll notice less and less as you drink it, but if you're used to lower ABVs I'd say it'll be detectable but likely not a show-stopper for you. As soon as it was gone I felt myself wanting one more sip.  M - Carbonation seems just a bit weak to me, maybe just because I'm expecting a ton with this massive head. Body would be fairly full and creamy, partly because you'll likely have quite a bit of foam with every sip. Hits a sweet spot in cellaring temperature, and then seems to get progressively heavier as it warms (or as you imbibe the 8.5% ABV).  D - I have to say, I like this beer quite a bit, but the high ABV will likely knock you on your butt before you can really have a ""session"" with these. I'm a relative novice to beer and this could well be a ""gateway beer"" out of macros and into beer nirvana. I will say that I sampled two other beers today and about 2/3 of the way through the Duvel I would say drunk is a pretty appropriate term at the moment.  For those in Louisville or Lexington, Liquor Barn sells these as singles for a dollar, as opposed to the $3 or $4 you'd normally pay or $6 in bars like O'Sheas or Nachtbar. At a buck it's probably one of the best beer values around.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,farrago,4.75,"The white foam whipped to a fine consistency across the surface, a maelstrom of tiny bubbles, cloudy dark straw yellow, yet allowing for visibility of the streaming beads. Focused penetrating power to the nose, lemon and white grapefruit citrus, onion skin, apple, pear and pomegranate fruit, fresh yeast yet to ferment, light mixed baking spices, hoppy without seeming caught in the ""hops versus malts"" dichotomy. Medium-bodied, with the firmness to appear denser and larger. The ginger, clove more evident here, teams up nicely with the lemon, grapefruit citrus. The carbonation nudges more than pushes. Apple, apricot, cherry fruit, more snap than juice. Allusion to honey, grain to granola flavors. While well-paced, there's also a creaminess to absorb any bumps in the road.

There is some slight spice from the hops and the malt is very sweet and sugary. I admit that this style is not one of my favourites, but Duvel is the defining beer of the style. Not a lot of alcohol at all, while the yeast is quite pronounced.  The mouthfeel is pretty thin with a medium carbonation.  Good drinkability for the ABV and overall.

A big chewy beer bursting with toasted grains and a perfect sour sweet balance. I found it to be mildly tangy and carbonated at first, but this seemed to diminish (likely due to the 8.5% abv washing over my tongue combined with lessening carbonation).

D-Very,very,very drinkable.Wonderful balance,smell and taste.I still can't believe that it's 8.5%!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,CoolJosh,4.62,"Thanks to treyrab for including this in my intro to craft beer way back when. Long story short, I gave Trey $100 five months ago to buy me some ""good"" beer. Some of the stuff was ehhh, some as great as the Southampton Grand Cru. Long story short, this is one of the few beers that I have left from Trey's buying, so here we go.  Shit, It's a fizzer. I lightly cracked the side of the cap, and it viscously foamed out of the side. I was fortunate to capture at least 8 or 9oz.  A. It looks good. Slight hazy yellow. Plain and simple. No color tones. To be honest it looks a very good lager. A nice foamy white head. Decent lacing around the glass which shows a nice body to the beer. It actually looks like a single belgium.  S. HOLY WOW!!!1!!one!!! This smells unbelievable. One of the best smelling trippel's I've laid my nose on. Incredibly smooth, with tons of banana, orange and lemon zest coming out very well. Tons of the fruit comes out in addition to a very mild hops presence is apparent.  T. Great fruit presence. No alcohol is present, which really makes for an easy and enjoyable drink. I'm getting some freat apple taste, some banana, tons of lemon, and a little bit of orange peel. It's so well blended and so smoothly constructed. It's a little bit on the lighter side which is this beers only weakness. This beer is awesome.  I will be purchasing a couple of large bottles, I'd like to try this again in the near future and aged, as this is an perfect representation of the style.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Choppr,4.6,"A - I poured this offering into a Duvel Logo tulip glass that came with a 4 bottle gift pack. The glass has etching on the inside bottom to promote/maximize the head. Beautiful golden coloring with exceptional voluminous head.  S - unmistakably Belgium... sweet, malty  T - sweet up front, fruity and effervescent with a little bite  D - Beautiful Belgian. It has a high abv so you are getting bang for your buck. Highly drinkable. Enjoy!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Gyle41386,4.7,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle purchased at Total Wine in Columbia, SC.  Pours a clear golden color with a HUGE foamy head that left soapy spiderweb lacing all over the glass. Just looks beautiful in the glass. I had always seen the pictures of the beer in the tulip glass where there's more foam than beer and thought they must have been doing it wrong. Not the case. Reminded me of the movies where the parents leave the children at home and they get into the washing machine or dishwasher and suds absolutely fill the kitchen. You could take a bubble bath in this head.  Smells fruity with some hop spice. Citrus and floral notes are evident.  Taste is also fruity and sweet, and there is a gentle hop finish. Excellent balance. Dries out considerably while you drink it. The alcohol gives a warming sensation.  This beer is smooth, crisp, and very very creamy. Very drinkable.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,TheTrevor,4.32,"Finally getting around to trying this one. It poured a pale cloudy gold with a fluffy two-finger head with a lot of lacing. The smell is fruity with some yeast and a bit of alcohol. The taste starts off with some fruity sweet malt that gives way to some yeastiness that fades into balanced hops and a dry finish with a little alcohol warming, without any overwhelming alcohol taste. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with some fine carbonation that provides a very pleasant crispness. An incredibly drinkable beer, especially for the proof. The shining example of the style, a great beer that's a must try for anyone interested in beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,schoolboy,4.9,"Can you say perfect? This is a beer clearly inspired by the devil himself. I just want to spend the rest of my living days drinking this non-stop. Water and food are unnecessary. Only Duvel.  The rest of the reviewers were correct, of course. This is an excellent brew, one of the greatest. I want MORE! All other beer is pretty lame compared to this. It is delicate, yet it kicks ass. It has a ton of flavor, yet it never offends. It is real purdy in the glass too.  It makes me want to move to Belgium.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Mistofminn,4.47,"Re-reviewed on 03/10/09  Went out and bought a four pack of these cute little bottles. The only reason I didn't get the 750 ml caged and corked bottle was because I wanted to cellar 1 or 2 bottles to see how they mature, but I also wanted to enjoy it on the spot. It has been 3 months since I've had a Duvel and I need my fix!  Pours a clear light golden color. Lively carbonation and an aggressive pour produce a massive white and bubbly head. After a few minutes it shrinks to a chunky centimeter or so, and it stays that way through the last drink.  Ah, Duvel! Spicey yeast and fruity goodness! A little bit of hops are present. To me, Belgian Strong Pale Ale's are very similar to Tripel's, and this one stands up to the best of them. There is no alcohol that I can detect.  Down the hatch, golden nectar of the gods! Oh, fruity waves crashing into my taste buds. How gentle, how smooth! This has truly been touched by the hand of god himself!  Ok, now that I'm done being corny. Incredibly crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Very light. Alcohol isn't in the least bit intrusive. Overall, one of my favorites!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,clayrock81,4.15,"Poured into my tulip glass for a slightly seethru gold body that had a voluminous soapy head that was sticky and left lace patches everywhere as it scaled down my glass. A great citric and floral burst in the hops along with fruits usch as orange and pear and hints of sweet malt. Medium-bodied and a little slick, citric hops abound on the tongue and are balance with hints of pepper and spices and a pronounced fruit taste of orange and maybe banana and pear. Also a sweet malt base in the body and even a little bready and chewey. One of the greats to have anytime.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,bmwats,4.33,"Poured into my official Duvel tulip.  A: Cloudy golden color. Light carbonation pours into a 4 finger frothy, craterous white head. Almost like a milk shake. Bubbly holey foam remains as the head slowly creeps into the body of the brew leaving foamy clinging lacing on the sides of the glass. Settles into a half finger uneven layer of thick foam on the surface throughout the experience. Leaves solid, albeit spotty, lacing as you drink it down.  S: Yeast, wheat, citrus hints.  T: Hops, yeast, and lemon. Hint of sweet honey, as well. Slightly bitter, and hoppy. Dry finish.  M: Creamy feel. Yeast overwhelms a little at first. Citrus taste comes into play, bitterness remains.  D: Solid drinkability. Strong alcohol taste, but not too much. Nice refreshing drink due to a light creamy feel.  Well, this is a good brew. Good flavor, great atmosphere, very distinctive soft feel gives it a really solid drinkability. Great quaff.

Smells yeasty and fruity with a charcoal like note to it - very inviting. Enters your mouth in very clean fashion with great ""cut"" - the nose follows nicely into the palate. Finishes dry with a slight hop bitterness to it. Medium bodied with good carbonation. This is extremely drinkable and deserves the BA following and high scores. 11.2 ounces disappeared way too fast.

T: Complex light to medium fruit warms to wheaty esters. Complicated and delicious.  M: Heavier than your eyes would have you believe, though not quite chewy. Altogether very smooth and dangerously good.  D: Scary. I could session this stuff, though I wouldn't be standing afterward. It's deceptive as the complex flavors distract from the relatively high alcohol content.

The good parts.. comes in a sweet looking bottle unlike anything else, is pretty drinkable and smooth, and the 8.5% ABV is very well hidden. The bad.. has a very bland taste to it.. like really bland. To me it's like a watered down hefeweizen, I was expecting a lot more different types of flavors from this one. I dunno, when I pay $3 for a single 12 oz I want something extraordinary.. and this just doesn't cut it. The Stoudt's Maibock 12 pack I got on clearance for $6.99 has a helluva lot more taste than this.

Smell apple, alcohol, very clean smelling not strong, simliar to a lager but the quality comes up much better.  Taste Wow not even close to an American lager in taste this is good. Some fruitness/sweetness along with some spiceness in the taste. I get both wetness and dryness all in one swallow. Finishes a bit tangy not quite bitter but close.  Mouthful Very clean and refreshing. Nice quality beer in the mouth.  Drinkability. I think this may be one of the most drinkable beers I have ever had. Refreshing cool, and plain good.

222,695,Brew33,4.46,"Duvel. I had been wanting to try this beer for some time and I finally have.... I was not disappointed.  I wasn't sure I was going to like this. Generally I like American style beers. Big flavors, big aromas. This beer is a little more subtle and clean.  To me it smelled a little bit like a Hefe. Slight banana and clove aroma. The head was puffy and white as snow, clumpy. The beer itself was one of the palest beers I have ever seen.... Zillions of bubbles....  As for the taste, wow. Amazingly clean and crisp. Subtle yet strong. Slightly spicy, I get a little Granny Smith Apple too. Champagne dryness that is remarkable. What a beer. You get a slight alcohol twinge but it isn't overpowering. Very little hop prescence.  Butter smooth in the mouthfeel dept. Which is another crazy part of this beer. It is so crisp in taste yet so smooth in mouthfeel. The drinkability is pretty high considering the high ABV.  Great beer. I was left wanting more of this.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

The nose is of pears with a bit of alcohol evident.  Pear/apple continues on the palate. The alcoholic warmth is there but well integrated.  This is incredibly drinkable but the high ABV makes it very dangerous.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Minimal lacing as it streaks down the glass back into the beer fairly quickly.  S: Spicy yeasty with hints of sweet fruit and a bit of pepper. Slight hops detected.  T: Malty sweet wtih fruit flavors of banana, apple, melon coupled with the spicy yeasty flavor of clove and maybe some cinnamon. I even get some peppery spicyness. Finish is long as the sweetness gets overcome by the drying hops flavor. Nice!  M: Medium but coating. Not over the top, but it sits and feels good in the mouth. Slight alcohol taste, but it is very welcomed. Crisp and clean.  D: High, the 750 went down very nicely. A nice drinking easy going Belgian Pale.  Overall another very good classic Belgian beer that deserves the praise and great scores. An excellent beer that is readily available.

222,695,InsolublePancake,4.13,"Alright, I'm finally using my Duvel tulip for its intended purpose.  A- Beautiful light gold with a big white head. The legendary head is tempered somewhat by my wetting the glass before pouring, but it is still substantial.  S- Lots of yeasty aromas and a lemony tartness are prominent. I don't know why, but I kind of expected this to smell sweet. Instead, it seems to have a saison-like dryness. Not that I'm complaining; it's very good.  T- The flavor actually starts off somewhat sweet before segueing into grainy malt. The tartness that was hinted at in the smell shows up, too, although it's not too strong. The finish is tart and fairly dry with only a touch of bitterness. Very refreshing.  M- Light to medium body with plenty of carbonation, although not too much.  D- Very good. I never would have guessed that this beer was 8.5% alcohol. I could easily have a couple of these.  Overall a very good beer, worthy of its status as a ""benchmark"" BSPA. Although I can't say that it's my favorite of the style, it's still a great example and one that every beer-lover should try eventually. Plus, without it, we wouldn't have those sweet Duvel glasses. Anyway, definitely recommended.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Looks like a washing machine overflowing. Tons of lacing too. Extremely bright yellow color. Smell was very floral. Duvel tastes unlike any other beer out there. Tons of bubbles really attack your throat. Light and hoppy, heavy and smooth at the same time. You can find yourself drinking this quite easily, but also you can feel that this beer is no joke and certainly has some substance to it and has a bit of alcohol backbone. This is one of the first Belgian beers I have ever had, and will always be one of the best.

222,695,KickInTheChalice,4.48,"Carefully poured from the stubby 11.2 oz bottle into a Duvel branded glass. The label says best by 04/2010.  Appearance: The appearance of this beer is absolutely perfect. With a very careful pour (I have tried a number of times) I easily get a full, gorgeous head each time. It laces nicely around the glass, and most of the head will remain for the duration of the beer, supported by a never-ending supply of carbonation from the bottom. The color is a golden, pale yellow, with visible cloudiness from the yeast.  Smell: This is when you truly start to wonder if this is champagne. The smell is very crisp, with a mild aroma of green apples and a little bit of alcohol in the background. The alcohol is not as noticeable as I would expect out of an 8.5% ABV.  Taste: The pale malt is what I notice first, with the yeast gradually working its way in. The middle brings a mild taste of apples and some sweetness to the front. There is a subtle taste of the hops that is barely present. I don't notice the alcohol until the end of the sip.  Mouthfeel: This is one incredibly smooth beer. The bubbles dancing on your tongue allow you to feel the crisp carbonation, while the combination of alcohol, yeast, pale malt and just a hint of hops is light and refreshing.  Drinkability: Since each sip is crisp with flavor and carbonation, at the end of each sip, my mouth is asking for another. It's tough to argue.  I worked my way through 3 very enjoyable bottles dissecting this one; overall it is a very well put together beer. I took off a point for taste, simply because I prefer a different type, but I may revisit this later. It is tough to argue with someone who says this is a perfect example of a Strong Pale Ale.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,jjanega08,3.81,Review Number 50!!! A little milestone for me. :) A= amazing! It's a nice golden color that's completely clear when you look through the glass. The head is not to be messed with. Pour it right the first time or you will have to deal with too much or too little head the whole way through because this one lasts all the way. Its clear white like snow and chunky too Big bubbles that kinda look like soap bubbles. Awesome lacing on the glass as well. S= I picked up booze in the beginning followed by a very tart apple smell to it with some citrus hops deep in there. T= A little boozy when it's cold but as it warms up a little the apple tartness takes over nicely with some hoppy bitterness to it as well and last is a citrus bite M= Light smooth and clean all the way. No stickiness or anything here. D= decent. For some reason I just don't think i enjoyed the taste of this one as much as everyone else so that would defer me a little bit. Also the price is very high so I prolly couldn't afford to drink to many and last but not least the booze would take me down quickly.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,ecoastman,4.23,"Drinkability - a very enjoyable beer. However, I prefer strong beers to have strong, complex and pronounced flavours. This is, in part, to slow down the high octane drinking.  On a personal note, I prefer a Tripel style Belgian like the Canadian made La Fin Du Monde.  This beer is light tasting and too many could easily be consumed in what might turn into a messy and violent session. It's not my favorite, but it is an excellent beer.  Appearance - a pale, clear, straw-like yellow. The fine champagne carbonation provides a fluffy rocky-tipped head with excellent retention and makes the beer look very inviting. Nice lacing along the way.  Smell - very mild aromatic qualities. A clean aroma with sweet, hoppy, perfumy, grassy, floral, citrusy aromas. It basically smells like a good average ale with no outstanding odours.  Taste - similar to what you smell. The mild flavours are very well balanced. It starts hoppy but the bitterness is mild. The finish is dry and the volatiles from the alcohol are slightly noticeable. Mild but complex ""belgium-like"" notes are detected after the finish. This beer is widely considered as the ""standard"" for the style.  Mouthfeel - ultra-light from the high carbonation while smooth and watery. A slightly course finish from the alcohol which quickly dissipates.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

The real highlight in this girl's look though is the ridiculously frothy head, cavernous, and leaving suds all over the glass's sides. The nose is nice and citrusy, with hints of wet wood and pepper.  This beer has some sparkling viscosity upon touching your lips, and then becomes incredibly light, going down very smooth. Flavors are predominantly yeasty, sour dough, citrus, and just an overall tart flavor. No note dominates more than the other, and it has just a general ""beer"" flavor to it.  The alcohol is incredibly masked on this one, as I'd be sure I was drinking something more along the lines of the 5.5-6 range. Though after a few sips you do begin to get a nice warming feeling.

Taste: Grainy, lemony-zest, accompanied by a floral uprising of excellent hop presence. This one is a tad spicy, good fruit boastfullness, along the lines almost of a Champagne.  Mouthfeel: Pretty damn carbonted, this one feels like it's burning a hole in my tongue. My Duvel chalice displays the bubbles excellently with this beer, you really don't appreciate your Duvel chalice until you pour this in it.  Drinkability: At 8.50 ABV, this is like drinking water, an excellent balance of hops and overall satisfaction, I can easily polish alot of these off yet at such a high ABV, it feels like your drinking a lite beer. This is a classic beer that I'm glad I finally tried and look forward to having again in the future!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Clubchat,4.3,"SAQ de Val-d'Or  A - It pours a hazy clear golden with a good head, good lacing too  S - Fruit (banana, apple, bit of plum), strong belgian yeast, alcohol is definitly present  T - Well-balanced hop-malt-alcohol level for the style, spicy & sour in final  MF - Very carbonnated, sharp & fizzy, sour on the tongue  D - Really a fabulous beverage, one of my favorite for sure",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,pumpkin1,4.35,"Poured into my Duvel Tulip glass.  Appearance is light golden in color with approx. 3 inch pure white head. Very nice. Lacing appeared down the glass until the very last sip. Thick foam in the center of the lacing.  Smell is apple, like a tart granny smith.  Taste is pure goodness. Orange, corriander and biscuits. Amazing.  Mouthfeel was good. Seemed very carbonated to me but went down very, very smoothly.  This is my favorite Belgian beer. One for me is just fine.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,SykDoc,4.08,"Poured this from a bottle into a snifter. It pours a cloudy golden appearance when held to the light. Streams of carbonation can be seen. The head is white and a good 3 inches with a slow decrease.  The aroma includes notes of yeast, apples, and bananas that are mild compared to the overall scent of champagne.  The taste is reasonably similar to the nose. It is quite complex and blends very nicely with the mouthfeel. A mild hoppiness is noted along with some spice, although the apple and banana seems to linger.  The mouthfeel is quite carbonated but smooth with a medium body. Overall, I think this beer is quite drinkable although I'm afraid to see what happens if I had several of them, because of the alcohol content. It is quite good and I will enjoy this again in the future.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,cindiwindi1025,4.9,"I have to say right off the bat that my bottle of Duvel exploded when I CAREFULLY popped the cap - I am left with literally half a bottle and am kind of hacked off about that. Otherwise....  A: Pale, straw yellow color that is cloudy and has light effervesence. BIG head - my glass has been 80% head the entire time - that seems to have a delicious life of it's own. As the liquid in the glass is consumed, the lacing from the head holds it's territory on the glass. Nice!  S: Strangely, this does not smell like beer. It smells like a mix of champange and pop.  T: The taste is incredible. It's a light-sweet, banana...banana bread, but not as bready as banana bread. It's faintly bready, but it's sweeter than breadier. It's damn delicious.  M: Smooth, milky, creamy. This beer definitely packs some carbonation and I'm not sure how it's not prickling the heck out of my tongue but it's not.  D: This is now (I say this way too oft) my favorite beer. It's damn delicious, light enough to be drinkable yet isn't forgettable. It packs a nice alcohol punch but on the down-low...it's so effortless. My absolute favorite of favorites....",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Hojaminbag,4.73,"This is one fantastic looking beer. Hazy yellow body with just a few yeast particles that escaped from the pour. Dvuel boasts a huge, solid white head that is thick and rocky, leaving a tower of foam on top of the ring that settles onto the body. Retention is fantastic, the head sticks around during the entire drinking of this beer. Lacing isn't so much lacing as walls of chunky foam on the sides of your glass. A great looking beer.  Sweet sugary aroma combined with some ripe fruits. Apple and banana come to mind. Banana is probably the strongest fruit aroma. A little bit of alcohol. Overall, Duvel actually smells a little bit like champagne.  Taste is similar to the aroma, but I think better. Lots of sugary sweetness with some fruit flavors. I taste apple, pear and banana. Unlike the aroma, the banana isn't dominant. A good, bready, pilsner malt flavor rounds things out nicely. Just a touch of alcohol and a lot of dryness toward the finish. Duvel is full-flavored and complex, while remaining balanced; it is a great example of a Belgian Pale Ale, if not the best example.  Medium bodied with a somewhat slick feel on the tongue, but a with dry finish. A ton of active carbonation that suits this beer very well.  This beer has pretty good drinkability. I probably prefer to sip rather than down it, but it is well balanced and worth spending a little bit of time enjoying. As beer goes, it tastes a little bit like a very dry champagne, but the sweet grape flavors are replaced by sweet malt and yeast characteristics.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,OlieIPA,3.71,"I've been having a lot of stouts lately that haven't had too much head, so I've been pouring my beers pretty hard. Anyways, I decided to do this while pouring this beer....big mistake! This beer is so heady, that I wasn't even sure it even had beer in it. LOL. Anyways, let me get serious with this review.  A: Big and frothy looking head along with a rich golden color.  S: A mix of apple cider and banana aroma followed by subtle Belgian spices.  T: Again, a strong apple cider influence along with some sort of citrus fruity character.  M: A light to medium body that leaves your mouth refreshed and rejuvenated; lower carbonation than expected.  D: Good with no hints of alcohol; a good beer to enjoy after a long day.  Overall: A good beer, not mind-blowing for me. It's definitely worth a try if you get a chance.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,ChainGangGuy,3.96,"Appearance: Pours a clear, golden body with a tall, airy, cloud white head. Notable head retention and tons of fine, sticky lacing throughout.  Smell: Delicate malts with soft touches of clover honey. Mild floral and spice notes, along with fruity hints of pineapple and banana-flavored bubblegum. Lightly boozy, but it's a classy booziness, mind you.  Taste: Soft pale maltiness with a light honey sweetness. Splash of dessert wine. Bits of banana, chewing gum, and ripe pineapple. Slight sour yeastiness. Light floral and spicy Noble hop character and bitterness. Peppery alcohol, particularly on the otherwise drying, fruity finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Moderate carbonation. Very slight stickiness throughout.  Drinkability: Rather drinkable despite the 8.5% ABV. A respectable stalwart member of the classic Belgians.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,snaotheus,4.22,"Bright golden color, not very cloudy, surprisingly large head and exceptionally strong lacing (it never faded, it was still on the glass in the morning). Nice hops background, slightly yeasty taste, and a sunny feeling in the mouth. I could drink a few of these if they were available.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,popery,4.53,"One of the best Belgians. The head is simply gigantic and it is a Belgian Strong Pale that lives up to the color part of that name. It's a light yellow beer, and the head is sterile white in color. It's also an entirely wonderful head. It's like the most aggressive bubble bath in the world. There are large and small bubbles that pile atop one another and take ages to settle away. The smell is all Belgian. It's earthy and spicy and perfectly blended with the alcohol. The flavor is tart and earthy, like eating a sour apple while sitting in hay. The good folks at Duvel make phenomenal beer. God bless the Flemish.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,paco1029384756,4.4,"Pours a light gold color with 3 fingers of fluffy white head.  Scent of sweet malts, sugars and some fruits. Light considering the strength, no alcohol detected.  Taste of sugars, yeast and some malts initially, a more potent malt character comes in with a hint of alcohol. Finishes with some yeast and malts lingering for a short while.  Mouthfeel is light and crisp, carbonation is strong, but welcome.  Overall, this is just a damn good beer, and I will more than gladly drink it again. It just makes me wonder why I took so long to try it.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,germanbeer1,4.35,"By far one of my top three Belgian beers. It has an outstanding gold-colored body with a very faint smell of fruit. What I enjoy about Duvel is that the taste is incredibly smooth with only a very small amount of fruitiness, yeast and alcohol.

Aroma of slight funk, alcohol is apparent.  Classic combination of yeasty breadiness, slight hoppiness, and mellow sweetness makes this one of my favorites.  Medium body , with slightly dry finish. Over carbonation is to be expected.  Overall one of my favorite sippers.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,markpiazza,3.83,very nice tasting beer. Kind of fruity taste. The only problem is that my buddy bought a 4 pack and 3 of the 4 as soon as opening them overflowed terribly. Why is that with this beer. If it wasnt for that this would be a regular in our beer fridge. now im not sure of getting this one again.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,hokies1999,4.88,"This beer pours a very golden hue, similar to Bud but that's where the similarities end. The beer is bubbly like champagne throughout the entire drinking experiance. It has a sweet floral aroma, a sweet fruity nose with a champagne like mouth feel and white wine like finish on the sides of the tongue. Duvel is a confused brew. It's an ale that thinks it's a world class champagne. The only thing that reminds me this is an ale is the finish that is not as dry as champagne.  Duvel should be savored with each sip. It's obvious care and effort went into this delicate brew. I can't believe an ale of this golden hue can have so much sweetness and flavor. Truely reminded me of my breif time in Germany.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Golden, straw-like color.  Some spice as well as fruity overtones in the aroma. Sweet malt taste as well as fruity and spicy notes. A nice lingering light spicy aftertaste. Light on the palate. A crisp and delightful finish.  I could drink this 24/7.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,WalrusJockey,4.89,"Poured into the Duvel branded tulip.  The beer smells, to me, similar to a brut or dry Champagne. The light, fruity, sweet-but-not-sugary sent is nothing if not enjoyable.  The color of the beer is similar to that of many lighter beers, and not dissimilar to a great many crummy beers. The most visible difference is that Duvel, when poured properly, has a massive (~50%) head, which, in the branded glassware, is sustained long enough for the bottle to be consumed.  The head itself is light and sweet, with fruity elements, wonderfully enjoyable. The beer is similar, although certainly less sweet and fruity. Personally, I am no fan of sweet beers, but Duvel rides the line perfectly, with a flavorful sweetness, combined with a dash of crisp tartness.  The beer is, as many of you know, 8.5% ABV, which is shocking considering the delicious, non-tart flavors. A devil of a combination, indeed.  Post Script- the branded glasses are Highly Recommended as well. Well worth the price.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,FACEMEAT,3.51,"Poured from a 12oz. glass into snifter.  A: I was not at all impressed with the pale straw color, but the head was one of the most substantial and beautiful I've seen. Gorgeous lacing left on the glass.  S: Alcohol and a sweet wheatiness predominate.  T: Dried apricot and earthy wheat were the first flavors I noticed. Upon warming, the flavors intensified and I noticed a spicy pepper finish as i drew near the end of the glass. One thing I was slightly put off by was the strength of the alcohol flavor throughout. Normally, I don't mind an astringent alcohol bite, but I felt it interfered with this beer's flavors.  M: The color suggests a thin, watery mouthfeel, but Duvel is anything but.  D: Aside from the alcohol overtones, this is a delicious brew.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,DeliriumDuck,4.68,Nice thin head with a golden body.  Aroma is a bit musty with a hint of lime.  The carbination combined with the twang of the alcohol scream champange but the secondary flavors say otherwise. The alcohol is subtle with an applesauce hint which is masked by a wheaty bitterness and wonderful amount of alcohol. A unique balanced beer that I would love to discover in the back of my fridge.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,kcillini77,4.7,"Head retention is amazing on this beer. Pour it correctly to avoid too much head. No pouring straight down the center for this one.  Looks a lot like a domestic lager in terms of color, but the taste is anything but. Smells of hay, flowers, spicy hops. Taste is similar and is very yeasty.  Just a great beer. I was craving some last night but the store I picked it up at didn't have it cold, so am enjoying it tonight. Should never go very long without filling my Duvel tulip with its namesake.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,skylab,3.97,"I like this beer. A lot. It was quaffed initially from a bottle which is probably not the proper etiquette for such a beer but sometimes we do not have time for frivolous formalities.  My ex-brother-in-law brought some over one evening - which made me suspicious from the beginning - and he showed me the receipt from the purchase. To say I thought he overbought would be an understatement. $15 for a 4-pack? After one sip I had to re-evaluate my position. This stuff is righteous!  We used a cabinet-mounted opener to open the first bottle which was a mistake. It resulted in an overflowing, overpowering blast from the bottle which we felt ruined the initial impression of taste. This was also true with the second bottle. The third and fourth bottles were opened with a ""church key"" and the experience was entirely different. No overflowing blast and a much more crisp, tingly impression up front.  I MUCH preferred this crisp/tingly impression. Many beers I have tasted have disappointed me by a lack of carbonation. But this one - opened by key - did not disappoint in that respect. I like a little tongue-tingle from the carbonation process. I believe it is part and parcel for the experience and has a definite place in the taste spectrum. That's why ""nitro beers"" lack in taste in my opinion. Lotsa head but no taste; like a cheap date. But I digress...  Anyway, short story long, this is a beer not to be missed. Very drinkable - if not frat-boy material - but it definitely drinks softly and carries a big stick. A really big 8.5 stick. Not overly sweet like a barley wine but certainly not weak like your average mass-produced Belgian. Use with caution. Perfect for forgetting one of ""those days"" at the office. Just don't plan on leaving the house.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,nightswatch,4.58,"Oh Duvel. Oh how I love it. Theatrics aside, this truly is a phenomenal beer. Poured properly and into the right glass, the lacing is uniquely tenacious (not to mention gorgeous) and the nutty head persists for HOURS. It truly looks appetizing like no other in a tulip. It smells great as well. A fair bit of alcohol in the nose. Whats truly exceptional about the beer is its mouthfeel and drinkability. at 8.5% it really is a devil, and the alcohol is hidden so well that it will put you under the table if you choose to session it. Its perfectly carbonated and even sweet on the tongue, and leaves just a slight crispy finish coupled with enough alcohol to make you want to dive right back in. It tends to be prohibitively expensive to drink on a super regular basis, but on occasion its a tremendous treat.

T - the same spiciness as in the aroma (coriander and pepper) with hop bitterness. Very little sweetness from the malt.  M- Medium-bodied with the carbonated effervescence making its presense throughout the palte  D- Quite. I'd have two if I had two.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,HalfFull,4.15,"Poured from a stubby into my new 'Duvel' glass. Pours a light golden with a volcanic boil emanating from the bottom center of the glass. Head is well represented but not as robust nor as meringue like as I've seen in pours elsewhere(just realized that was at 8000 feet!). Offers sticky lacing and a nice easily regenerated frothy head, but not the retention I expected.  Smell is somewhat odd yet rather enticing, mostly of muddled and candied fruit with some semi-sour yeast notes. And the malty structure grows on you a bit. I sense I'm converting to a degree, or maybe not. Otherwise this brew reminds me a bit of a typical Euro lager, albeit with a more robust mouthfeel and a higher ABV. Yet that alone is not enough to encourage me to purchase again. A Damnation I would prefer. Will try again if I see it poured more richly as I may have had a corked bottle. Otherwise I don't see Duvel getting any more of my money,  Edit: August, 2009:  Picked up a 750ml. bottle and the meringue is back. A ridiculous head forms and fills the glass for like three and a half weeks. The cork put a dent in my ceiling and I was careful. Alas, I would like to consume this beer as opposed to just look at it. Patience my friend.  Smell is improved over the stubby but not by much and remains quite sweet on the tongue. Lager notes are not present either. Carbonation is a friend to this beer and apparently the stubby bottle may be a victim of carbonation loss, particularly with respect to the robust bottle conditioning of the 750 ml. bottle.  What a difference...review updated accordingly..",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Crisp, yeasty, fruity (lots of apple) and spicy. Sour at the end. M- Medium bodied with good carbonation. The alcohol is noticeable in the back of the throat but not in a boozy or unpleasant way.

Pilsener-like malt and hop profile, but smacked with Belgian yeast. Absolutely glorious.  The effervescence challenges that of champagne. In fact, it tells champagne to fuck right off.

It was quite expenisve i beleive but not sure because i got my beer store to get me 3 types of beers and i just bought all of them for 37 dollars.  I got a 4 pack of samuel smith's winter ale, the 4 pack of duvel with special glass, and a 6 pack of hobgoblin ale.  This is the first belgian ale that ive tried before that is not a wheat ale.  Might as well start at the top =).  Ive always heard so many great things about this beer like how it is one of the best beers that you can buy and now i strongly agree!  Smell: The banana esters in this beer will slap you in the face if u spin the beer alittle and smell it.  Apperance- A beautiful golden color that is kinda cloudy (im not sure if this has yeast in the bottle and this may be why)  Taste- this beer taste amazing and unlike any other beer ive ever tried (maybe the yeast strain or bohemian hops which ive never had b4)  Fruity,dry taste with the perfect level of carbonation and also this beer has a tiny bit of a quality champange taste to it.  Mouthfeel- perfect I cant put it any other way.  This beer is soooo delicious i think most beer drinkers out there would absolutley love this beer.  Another thing is that at 8.5% ABV this beer should knock your dick in the dirt but amazingly at 8.5% this beer goes down very very very very easily and just by drinking it you prob couldnt tell it has a high % like that, even though u can taste the alcohol when going down ur throat.

An almost spearmint like coolness burns in the mouth, tingling and peppery.  Drinkability is astonishing. High abv is almost completely undetectible.

Tastes of lemon zest, fruit tang, alcohol takes over the palate for a bit, and ends with some nice lemon sweetness.

The smell is really amazing...I smelled bananas right away for some reason, that went away quickly and i picked up the citrus fruit. The cirtrus I get are those tiny sloppy oranges that you would get in school lunch, i think they were mandarin oranges. The taste is kind of lemony citrus, the mid pallet is straight orange/mandarin, and the cirtrus and spicy finish lasts nice and long. There's almost no alcohol burn, but my stomach feels warm.

It looks like someone cut out styrofoam and laid it on the top of my beer.  There is a constant stream of bubbles and the beer seems very alive.  In the mouth it is very lively and has the perfect weight. It is not too light or watery but it isn't heavy and lethargic either.  The blend of spices comes across right away. Coriander is most prominent but there are strong hints of red and black pepper and even a little hoppy bitterness. The flavor is strait forward yet mysterious. It has a bit of a white grape, sour finish but not enought to make you pucker.

Pours a luxurious, clean (OK, slightly hazy) lemon honey body with ample carbonation rising to soapy meringue head with great lacing and good staying power. Light enough for Pilsener tones.  Mild spice (coriander, orange peel, the usual suspects) mesh well with very light Germanic malt and Saaz-ish hops and vibrant yeast electricity to create a light, fruity aroma.  This is extremely clean for such an enjoyable flavor profile. Mild shortbread cookie tones with hearty yeast electricity to generate a thirst-quenching, tingling classic Belgian pale.  Mouthfeel approaches perfection. Crisp, tingly and spicy but full flavor provides deep, enjoyable palate presence with slight piney Saaz hop bitterness to the finish.

As I journeyed to the specialty beer shop trying to find a pack of these, I pondered at how much food money I'd be slappin' to get this. A few minutes and a decidedly slimmer wallet later, I had the Devil. Would it be worth it?  Just after pouring this cloudy liquid gold into a snifter, I realized...it was.  A--A golden yellow with that foamy white head you get by following the directions on the bottle. Thought it was just the condensation on the glass at first, but actually soft and cloudy.  S--Sweet and fruity, with a savory base, but if I had to pick a ""low point"" this would be it. Mind you that low point is still fantastic.  T--First sip told the whole story. This is what they serve for breakfast in Shangri-La. Sweet, crunchy, to a lingering fruity (apply?) aftertaste.  M--As it goes into your mouth, clouds of tiny bubbles rush around and leave a creamy, smooth and somehow still light and refreshing tingle. A bit of alcohol fumes just tickle the sinus cavities and remind you that you are communing with Beelzebub.  D--This is scary. I put down two of these heady brews at way too much a pop and was still ready for the other two. It's taking a lot of willpower to save the others for another good night.  All things considered, I'm still relatively new at the beer tasting game. However, I've found my high point.

When sniffed I got a yeasty bready smell and nothing more, it smelled quite brut. The taste was simply boozy and nothing that I thought was too remarkable, but I'd be idiotic to not mention that it's flavor is remarkably clean- despite how weird it sounds after saying it was unremarkable. I kind of felt as thought I was drinking a cocktail. it also could have something to do with the temperature at which it was served, but I did warm it with my hands and had the same feelings about it. In the mouth it has crazy carbonation which I didn't mind at all. Its quite comparable to a brut champagne in my mind.

A--Pours a massive volcanic head, better measured in hands than fingers, that's pure fluffy white with lots of loose bubbly sheeting leaving cotton candy lacy all down the glass as the head won't quit through the tasting. Body is pure tawny, a little more brown than a pilsner and clear as stained glass with a nice bubble thread percolating from the bottom ""D"" in the glass. This beer seems alive.  S--Tons of yeast, smells like dough, like a proof starter for a fancy breadloaf. I also caught some lemon astringency that clarified and stung the yeast, followed by some fresh hoppy bark that cut into my nosehairs. Strap in, kiddies.  T--Doesn't disappoint. This is like beer that goes to 11. Every aspect--the yeast, the malt, and the hops--is on overdrive, and somehow doesn't compete or crowd out. Everything compliments, and there is nothing but pure fermented grain coming through here. The yeast really assaults you at first with that Belgian glory of musty citrus, and the backend of the hops smacks you with dry like a cold wet fish you can't get off the line. To push the metaphor, this puppy don't let you off the hook. Malt vertebrae keep everything from teetering wildly off course.  M&D--I hate carbonation. I like a beer that tastes like a door after you remove the hinges--a thudding flatness. But the devil won me over, as the bubbles make it more champagne-like than astringent. Absolutely refreshing and absolutely drop you on the floor potent at the same time.

Taste is superb: hoppy and bitter, with a bit of sweetness. At 8.5% you can definitely taste the alcohol, so this one's a sipper, but that makes savoring it all the better. Some spicy and citrusy notes from the yeast are complimented by a solid bitterness. Other reviewers have commented on how Duvel tastes almost like a wine or champagne, and I'd have to agree with them-- hard to describe, you've got to try it to know what we're talking about (maybe the acidity?).

I thought that with all the rave reviews and high expectations this beer would drastically fall short, but it is absolutely delightful.  I poured my unaged Duvel into the Duvel glass. Oh how I have wanted to use this glass to hold its true beer. This is actually a first for me - but not the last. I plan to house many beers in their brewery's glass as soon as I can collect more. The head was full - all the way to the top just like in Michael Jackson's book. Then the 1/2 inch lacing stayed for the rest of the beer.  The golden, clear, and very carbonated look is matched with the aroma. This may sound weird, but the smell is like that of an elephant ear from the fair. I can smell cinnamon, nutmeg, bread, and many other spices in this beer. Wow this is amazing and I haven't even gotten to the taste!  The mouthfeel is really surprising. At 8.5% ABV I was expecting a little heavier feel. By far and away the mouthfeel is much lighter and much much more carbonated than expected. The pilsner malt is really doing it for me here. But, I do know that the malt is just one small aspect. I believe the yeast strain that was derrived for this ale is the key factor to the unique flavors and smells. I would love to try other beers made with the same strain.  The taste is like several beers at the same time and each sip brings out a new flavor. The first sip is twangy almost like a wheat. The next like a bitter german pilsner. I must say I really enjoy Belgium golden ale. For a beer produced in such great quantity Moortgat has done a fine job in maintaining quality. I feel quite blessed to have received my bounty.  The end note of this beer is clean and hoppy. I enjoyed it greatly and will enjoy the other three in my closet.

222,695,EnojysAnyBeer,4.13,"MMM... this is good beer but didn't live up to the BA hype. Try a Maredsous from Duvel for something truly special. After reading countless reviews praising the divine grace of Duvel, I decided to rate another tasting... unfortunately, I realized I was drinking the same beer.  A- The head on this really sticks out: bone-white and formed of bubbles varying in size from microscopic to 1/4inch. Color is transparent yellow-golden  S- Smell is potent and reminds me of fruity bubblegum  T- Reminds me of bubblegum and soap at first. After a few sips I get some sweet malts but can't get past that bubble-soap flavor.  M- Feel is good. Not too light, no too heavy. Just right for a beer. However, carbonation is foamy and annoying  D- Drinks well for 8.5%ABV. At least it gets me drunk quickly",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Duvelmonami,4,"Duvel is the Belgian beer to start with. The smell, the appearance, the taste, the mouthfeel and drinkability are out of this world. Whether one tastes Duvel out from a bottle or from the tap, the beer is simply exquisite.  The latter is often considered as the definitive version of the Belgian Strong Golden Ale style...  ''Definate'', maybe not, (some microbrewery beers outclass commercial ones) but one would agree that drinking Duvel is an experience and an unforgettable one too.

Appears a pale golden yellow with a huge two inch white head that is kept alive by very lively carbonation. Lots of lacing down the side of the glass.  Aroma is very fruity with sweet tones of candi sugar and a sort of bready, yeasty funk. A bit of spiciness in the back.  Taste is what I expect from the aroma. Starts out nice and sweet with fruity tones then gradually becomes more spicy and finishes with some earthy hops.  Mouthfeel is medium-light, the carbonation level makes it very crisp yet creamy.

222,695,PatronWizard,3.44,"Poured this chub into a glass...  Looks like sparkling cider only with a much bigger head. Very pale. Completely alive with bubbles. The middle slowly sinks but the constant flow of soft carbonation acts as a perpetual head replenisher. This is one of the most dynamic beers I have ever seen. I was debating on whether to give it a 5 for appearance because I'm pretty damn stingy with the 5s, but after almost an hour it was still brimming with life. I decided the glass had a better chance of biodegrading than this head ever dying.  More aroma than the pale color suggested. Alcohol, plus....pineapple, or apple, or I don't know. Maybe acetone.  The taste is out of my descriptive range. Not really strong or bad, just elusive. To be honest, it reminds of the smell in the air when my wife does her nails.  Very light, very crisp, very dry. Too close to champagne for me.  Drinkability is like sparkling cider. How much could you have?  Overall: didn't hate it, but didn't love it either.

Aromas of light yeast, green apples, assorted spices. Very, very drinkable and the 8.5% is almost impossible to taste. Medium/high carbonation, medium body, creamy mouthfeel. Refreshing. Clean and crisp, slightly bitter and lacking the in-your-face sweetness of other high ALC% beers. Some fruity malt esters in the middle. Great balance. Amazingly quaffable for as potent as it is.

Smells of yeast and light fruits along with an array of spices such as clove, pepper, banana and a small whiff of alcohol.  The taste is quite complex, yeast and fruit then an alcohol warmness then finishes off with a slightly dry quality. Probably the strongest aspect is the sweet malts. Several complexities that I cant quite put a finger on.  Mouthfeel is crisp and smooth with a small bite of carbonation. Every drink has the distinct possibility of leaving a foam moustache.

Citrus and other light fruits are again present in the taste, but the hops come forward to add some bitterness. The sweetness is still rather overstated. Some spice, and big alcohol. Mouthfeel is somewhat sticky. Not really a fan of this one at all; the ever-present sweet pear taste combined with the alcohol just aren't appealing.

Being an experienced imbiber of this ale I was careful to pour gently in anticipation of the ever growing billowing white head.  First sniff their is a noticeably peppery spicing with a bit of apple. In addition to the aforementioned there's a wonderful interplay of hay and perfumy hops.  The ample carbonation creates a satiating feel, but remains light and airy making for a dangerous combination with the abv. The grass and hay combine with a lemon citrus for a quick zip of flavor that rounds out to a dry and spiced finish.

Lovely floral aroma which deepens as the beer warms up. Yeasty taste with soft edges and a mild sting as it goes down. You'll get plenty of fruit, too, but the breadiness is most present. Very bubbly but very, very smooth. Frankly, I was expecting something more explosive-- I've found that American takes on Belgian styles are bigger by comparison, generally speaking, and I drink more American than Belgian beer-- but I found this to be a pleasingly subtle experience.

A - poured a clear golden yellow with much bubbling within and a massive rocky 3"" head that retained beautifully and towered over the top of the tulip glass. Excellent islands of lace as well.  S - dear me, this was quite a trip! Fresh hoppy notes mixed with light malts, hints of lemony citrus, and yeast. It wasn't pronounced at first but it did so as it warmed  T - very balanced hoppiness and maltiness, much like a good German pils but with a deeper level of complexity of the Belgians. Hoppy bitterness, floral and citrusy pucker.  M - light bodied and well carbonated. Soothing on the palate  D - extremely drinkable for a 8.5% ale. You nearly don't taste the high alcohol until it warms a bit.  Overall - Wow this is astonishingly drinkable for an 8.5% abv beer. Quite different from what I expected. The pilsener taste was a pleasant surprise. I'd say this could be a white wine substitute. Substantial enough to complement a pizza or an Italian sausage or could very well be paired with some fish or grilled chicken. Swirling the bottle and adding yeast gives it a whole new level of complexity and added cloudiness to the glass. The alcohol will catch up to you so if you bought a 750 mL like I did, please enjoy it with a special someone. As the temperature increases, so does complexity and detectability of the alcohol. I will definitely buy again and see how it ages.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Smell is considerably more complex with that unique Belgian yeast strain along with fruit and spice.  Taste is equally enjoyable having complexities that are beyond my simple palate. Banana, fig, spice, and clove? I wish I could give a better evaluation but I'm still developing a vocabulary for the beglians.  Mouthfeel is typically high in carbonation and alcohol. Drinkability suffers as a result of the aformentioned.  Enjoyable and worth a try. This is probably the status quo for belgian strong pale ale so all others can be judged accordingly.

The yeasts and funky citric hops, fruity, wonderful. It even smells good through the two inch head, which doesn't happen often.  Sweet, candied, malty, fun beginning, a deliciously spicy hopping, the yeast bangs in, its a cacophony, a symphony.

222,695,Brianmerrilyn,4.46,"For some unknown reason, I've passed this one by at the store or gin mill for the past two years. I reckon it was the color that confused me, but as soon as I saw it was a Belgian Strong Pale Ale, my desire to obtain and consume grew. Obtained a 750ml bottle that had been sitting in my job's pantry for about six months and they were going to throw it away!!! Brought home and forgot about it for a few more months. Finally asked my wife where it was and she told me she put it on the porch in front of the house. With the hot weather, I was not very encouraged about what would come out when corked. However i endeavoroed to persevre and chilled it in a picher full of ice for an hour which may have been a mistake. Almost killed myself when uncorking, 2 seconds after I untwisted the fastener, the cork shot up to the ceiling of my shed and punctured a hole in the insulation.  The head was so large that it filled the entire snifter and had to pour out entirely for the first and hopefully last time in my life. 2nd pour came out with a four finger head, no chunks, small hills of creamy white foamy head. The color was murky golden with sediments at the bottom of the glass.  S: Not as stong as I would have predictd, yet I chalk that up to being stored incorrectly. For the most part, spices and cloves came first, yeast and could not determine if faint sweentess was estery or candy/gum.  T: A bevy of flavors coming in and out starting with moderate sweet malts, the spicyness following the nose, bitterness coming in third with high ABV ominimpresent.  m - Thick, rich and creamy, heavy carbonated to say the least maintaining a fantastic balance. As it warms, the alcohol becomes more noticiable but not overpowering by any stretch of the imagination.  D-Luscious. This is a heavy weight in my book under the Belgian Strong Pale Ale classification. The complexity is beyond impressive. Much brighter than other BSPA's but not weak in any category. Takes time to pour properly and gets better as it warms up.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Carbonation is staying busy!  S - Fruity, maybe apple with a little alcohol noticed.  T - Man that's good. Again the apple presence is slight, with a light malt and alcohol balance. Great taste.  M - The carbonation and head combine for perfection!  D - @ 8.5% alcohol I would normally say only 1 or 2, but I could drink these all day/night.

222,695,ryrust5301,4.23,"Poured from a 330 ml bottle into a Unibroue tulip glass. I don't have the monster Duvel glass, so this one will have to do.  Appearance - Even in a smaller tulip glass this beers head is awesome to behold. Well over three fingers in length, with a creamy, white, cloudy, puffy look to it. Color is of a lite pale gold, almost a straw color.  Smell - Very yeasty with a peppery hop aroma. Very lite neat fruitiness to it as well.  Taste & Mouthfeel - Once again very yeasty as in the nose, but a clean malt creaminess doesn't let the yeast run away with things. Crisp and extremely refreshing feel to this one. Alcohol is just enough to make it's presence known, but not overpower. Finishes with a nice spicy pepper bite.  Drinkability - This one is a highly seductive sipper. No heaviness to it makes it so easy to consume, but be careful of the abv as you'll have no idea when it starts kicking around in your head. I make it a point to come back to this one often.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,TwinSox33,4.66,"This fine ale poured in a Pilsnery-like fashion, with excellent foamy head. The head retention remains until the last sip, and the foam rings run down the inside of the glass!  The beer smelled amazingly like a Pilsner, even though it's an ale, kind of interesting here. The smell was of (Saaz?) hops, and a bit of fruitedness.  The taste was exquisite. It had hints of citrus, a slight unidentifiable fruitedness, and a nice balancing presence of Budvar like hops. There was a fine malt presence, and a nice spicy/peppery yeast action.  Drinkability: Give me another! It's wet&quenchy, and then fades dry. Intregueing and fantastic. I CAN'T beleive this is 8.5%.

T & M: I am amazed by the taste of this beer considering the high alcohol content. It is simply not there. This is an exquisite tasting beer. There are many different textures. I do get a bit of pilsener, I also get some spiciness as well. This is one complex brew! Mouthfeel is excellent, this is a beer that remains on the palate and does not go away.

The beer pours a light golden with a pillowy white head that holds beautifully and leaves as much lace as possible on the side of the glass. The aroma is full of bready malts, golding hops, and spicy phenols. The taste recounts all of these aromas, a wonderful spiciness from the yeast and hops and meanwhile the malty sweetness and breadiness balances beautifully.

Balance of this beer is exceptional.  Mouthfeel: Medium body. Very, very, very carbonated. Did I mention it was carbonated?  Drinkability: A very good beer.

I poured ""unhurriedly"" like the label said and still had to back off a bit due to the enourmous fluffy white head. Let it settle for a second, but the head didn't really reduce, it just transformed into this amazing rocky, chunky, clumpy, uneven, crater-like creation. The thick clumpy lacing was akin to dish suds or bubble bath (I mean that in a good way). Lumpy head stuck around till the very end, leaving a foamy clump in the bottom of the glass.  Smelled slightly spicy, with yeast, peppery clove, and a moderate fruitiness.  Flavor of light malt up front, all the elements of the nose in the middle including a pear-like fruitiness, with alcohol and a hop bitter in the finish that remained in the aftertaste. Pausing for a minute or two between sips revealed a residual flavor reminiscent of white wine/champagne.  Mouthfeel was smooth, yet mantained a crisp bite.

222,695,gonzo46and2,4.55,"As belgian strong ales go, this one is very different than one would suspect. The normal flavors many associate with Belgian strong ales are not as prominent. Bannana/bubblegum tones from the wheat and yeast, candy-like fruity sugars,etc. This is not La Fin Du Monde or a Trappist beer. The malt flavor is more toward the pilsner or pale lager taste spectrum. That being said, it's really drinkable and I really liked the black pepper spiciness. And trust me, It is way more complex than most pilsner/pale lagers. It just looks beautiful in a glass with a crystal-clear pale golden color and a huge foamy white head. There's a good amount of bitterness and complexity but the sweetness you'd normally get in such a high ABV is just not there. I'd love to try a beer that is similar to Duvel in taste.

As the beer recedes down the glass it leaves a glob of whipped-cream like froth suspended in the middle, very nice.  Aroma displays a grainy malt sweetness with underlying fruity esters. Flavor starts with a spicy fruitiness that quickly gives way to a quenching, sharp dryness. The high carbonation accentuates the dryness and gives an explosive quality to the mouthfeel. There is also some hop bitterness in the finish, but it is overridden by the spice and tang. The alcohol is hardly noticible behind all going on here, you'd never know it weighs in at 8.5%.

My original review sounds borderline silly at this point and must be replaced. Here is a fresh review for a beer I am excited to try again with my newly formed appreciation for Belgian beers..  Here goes.  About as bright of a golden beer as I've seen. Perfect clarity and lots of active carbonation. The head is almost two fingers thick in a wide mouth wine glass...so that's rather hearty.. Pretty nice retention and a good amount of lacing stuck on the inside of the glass..  Aroma is bright, fresh... light malts..a bit of clove and a sense of the yeast. Some fruit notes, but nothing I can specifically point out... Maybe peach or white grape.  Very nice....I had a feeling I would enjoy this now... it's not nutty, but I get a sense of almond.. Juicy fruit gum? Really delicate . Some nice layered malt tones behind the fruit.. Very light and crisp.. Towards the end there is a nice subtle but definite lingering hop effect. This is very nice combined with the crisp nature. Some spice tones, but nothing is overpowering..  Body is feather light but with lots of flavor. The carbonation bursts the flavors into your mouth... This hides the 8.5% ABV very well...  Very drinkable... Could be scary on a warm summer afternoon..",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

There's a little alcohol heat and juiciness, some lightly sweet malt, orange peel and some peppery spice on the ultra-clean finish.

222,695,BullCityB,4.95,"Poured into a goblet, it's a beautiful straw gold ale with a rocky foam head that shows no signs of dissipating two minutes after the pour. It's a simply gorgeous sight on a hot day! Tiny bubbles are constantly rising to the surface and contributing to the aroma... speaking of which...  The aroma is a heavenly concoction of pears, apples, and spicy citrus with a touch of grain. Beervana, I say. I really hate to give it two fives out of the gate, but I can't find fault anywhere so far.  The flavor is, again, near flawless. It's a dry beer on the finish, but up front is a load of sweet flavors from the yeast - apples and pears mostly, with a touch of spice perhaps. There's a little grainy malt, but the finish is a quick flurry of noble hops. It's marvelous. 8.5% ABV? You would never know, there isn't a hint of alcohol here.  Mouthfeel may well be the only place that I'll mark this beer down. It's just slightly too prickly for my tastes, though it remains quite creamy and delicious. I would give it a 4, but for the style it's not overcarbonated, so I'll compromise at 4.5.  As far as drinkability, I could quaff this stuff all day. Maybe it's just the heat, but this hits the spot. I simply can't fault it for anything here.  Ok, I don't mean to seem a sucker, but this beer is almost impossible to fault. It's creamy, delicious, and aromatic beyond belief.

Ample carbonation creates a creamy smoothness unlike any other beer I've experienced. The taste has some fruity esters, pale malt sweetness, and spicy yeast.

Nonetheless, there is perhaps one style that identifies a nation more than others. This to me is it. It also has its own goblet. Gabe at Two Brothers seemed to be on a mission to educate us late one evening and started opening various Belgians. Pale yellow and slightly hazy in the glass, the noticeable thing is the head like a meringue that lasts the entire time: such fine structure and density; amateurs beware when pouring.

222,695,spointon,4.61,"I had this one from a 750ml brown bottle with cork and cage - poured in a Duvel tulip snifter glass.  A= This beer poured a beautiful pale yellow (almost paler than straw) that was almost perfectly clear except for a bit of yeast cloud in the glass. The head was out of control, 3+ inches of foamy white goodness. I seriously could have eaten this head with a spoon for the first 10 minutes or so. The head clung to the glass on the way down, more chunks than lace.  S= The aromas of this fine brew are a bit muted for my taste, but they do offer mild fruitiness (orchard fruits - apple/pear) and a sense of the looming alcohol.  T= This ale hits the tongue with a crisp, clean, malt flavor, followed by fruity yeast and a warming alcohol finish. There is also a nice level of hops - they are present as flavoring without being overly bitter. A big beer that doesn't taste too big (hence the devil reference).  MF= This ale has a big carbonation release throughout which lightens the already light/medium body. Completely cleanses the palate with its crispness!  D= This is a world class beer that is the benchmark of its style. I liked it the first time, and love it more every time I have it!!!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Champagne type bubbles rise to the surface througout the duration.  smell- Abundance of citrus and spice. Hints of malt and pepper.  taste- Extremely smooth and easy to take. Comes on sweet in the beginning but a little bitter and dry by the end.  drinkability- Hands down the best beer I have ever had. Was fortunate to have a friend recommend this to me at a restaurant while out of town and fell in love. A perfect combination of taste and strength.

As the head recedes, you get a nice clinging lace.  Smell- Nice complex smell that consists of a nice straw, light alcohol, yeasty, light citrus (lemon, orange), like pepper. Nice..  Taste- This reminds me a bit of bells batch 8000, although it's not really the same style. Initially, I get a nice orange, lemon component but also a dryer tart fruit and finally some pepper. The alcohol is pretty nicely hidden but as it warms, it becomes a little bit more evident.  Mouthfeel- Initially, the carbonation is a bit cloying, but can be spritzy, in a good way.

222,695,PatrickJR,4.18,"Poured from 750ml bottle into oversized snifter.  A - I probably didn't pour this correctly, because in the snifter I got a massive head, maybe six inches or so that took forever to die down. Nice and pillowy, with exceptional lacing and a nice patch still floating in the middle. Hazy bright yellow in color.  S - The main aroma is phenolic; plastic-like or something like the coating on a pill. Some spicy hops in the background, with myriad of spices, notably white pepper.  T - Faint malt to begin with, but then the brew unleashes it's full medicinal flavor. It's not terribly unpleasant, but it is a little overbearing. The finish yeilds a trace of hops providing ample bitterness, with a touch of citrus. Phenols return in the aftertaste, following slight, and pleasant, alcohol burn.  M - Moderately carbonated, but very slick. Seems a little out of balance to me, as if carbonation and slickness are busy competing. Surprisingly full bodied considering the color.  D - The beer gets better after the initial phenol shock on the taste buds which makes me think the more one drinks, the more one could drink. I definitely wouldn't have a problem kicking these back, but I wonder how long I could endure the medicinal flavor before I felt like I was chewing band-aids. It seems highly drinkable, but I'm only guessing.  I had Duvel once before, but regretfully I was fairly intoxicated when I got to it. The one thing I remember was it's phenolic character and that still stands out to me upon soberly revisiting this ale tonight. A good brew no doubt, but at least slightly overrated.

222,695,rodcom,5,This is my favorite beer in the whole world! From the minute you open it you know it is different - huge carbonation (if you are not careful it will explode when you open it). You then have to carefully pour it into a glass or it will overhead and spill out the top. You then look at it and it will be a golden color bubbling up much like champagne.  Then the real fun comes with the taste. It is a perfect tasting beer with a bit of citrus flavor and goes down so smooth.

The body is crystal clear and a pale golden color and is very nice to look at. It smells like dry hops mixed in with some citrus fruits and spices, I also pick up some hints of banana bread in there. It rolls on to your tongue pretty smoothly with a light semi-crisp feel to it, it has a medium body, but it is a bit more on the lighter side of the house. It's a bit bitter overall with some sweet undertones and a tangy aftertaste, the alcohol is very well hidden you can't even taste it in its aftertaste.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,jdoncbus,4.32,"Poured into SA Imperial Pils glass. Appearance is a vibrant, yellow-gold with about 6 columns of bubbles rising towards the fluffy, two finger head (think of ocean surf); good amount of lacing.  Smell is of clove, various spices, lemon/orange citrus rind, & earthy yeast. Notes of raw sugars and ginger-caramel make their presence known. An interesting note is that I pick up so many different things in the aroma, the final being sour cream frosting and faint champagne.  Initial reaction is a crispy beer that hits the palate with bitter yeast, grapefuit, butterscotch, apricot, and peppery spice. A very nice balance between slick and tart leave the mouth with mild numbing & distinct alcohol warmth. Similar to the smell, a complex beverage that keeps the senses on their toes and discovering different things.  Duvel is certainly the real champagne of beers in that it has many qualities of a beer and champagne (which obviously comes as no surprise). Honestly, I cannot stand champagne but enjoy this beer a great deal. My personal tastes wants a little more malt but this beer is certainly opening up the Belgian gates for my palate.

S: yeasty and fruity. also vinous, somewhat like a pinot grigio or other crisp white wine.  T: like a perfect white wine on steroids. Flavors of pear, apple, combined with yeasty tartness, mildly sweet malts, and balanced by hops, that don't seem too assertive, but aren't passive either. Incredible, wonderful balance and a terrific array/depth of flavors. Also some alcohol coming through.  M: strong bodied. This beer is everything that you would not expect from something that looks so angelic and light. Moderately carbonated, but also rich and creamy.  D: absolutely delicious - one to savor sip by sip, and do sip slowly, because it can kick ass.

222,695,prototypic,4.38,"Appearance: It pours a light golden straw color. There is a haziness to it that adds quite a bit to its appeal. The head is an enormous four fingers deep. The bottle suggested to ""pour unhurriedly"" and I now understand why. This is the biggest head I've seen on a beer. Nearly unbelievable. It's extremely slow to recede and leaves thick sheets of lace all down the glass. It's damn near immaculate.  Smell: It drops off a little here. There's plenty of citrus fruit (pineapple, apple, a little orange, and pear) aroma. It's sweet smelling, but not overly so. There's very light spices and banana present. Wrapping it up is a faint yeasty smell that blends perfectly with a slight alcohol aroma. Ultimately, it just lacks the punch that it needs here. If this could be reconciled...wow.  Taste: Apple, orange, and pear flavors strike first and permeate throughout. It's fruity and sweet, but not in a citrusy way. It's more laid back and even keel. There is a bit of malty sweetness that's balanced perfectly by light hop bitterness. Perhaps this is one of the most balanced beers I've ever tried. It is a little yeasty and that flavor remains into the aftertaste. Alcohol is barely noticeable. It's very well masked and a true testament to this beer's balance.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Surprisingly, it has a very light feel to it. Carbonation is top notch and it goes down very smooth. Clearly its feel is an invitation. I could drink a number of these despite it being 8.5%, which leads to my next point. This beer is deceptively strong. Its abv is masked so well that it in no way feels or tastes like a beer of its strength. Simply another complementary feature.  Duvel is clearly all that it's cracked up to be. I was initially skeptical of its ""Top 100"" status, but I was gladly proved wrong. This is a stellar beer. It could be slightly improved with beefing up the nose a bit.

The aroma is fruity with banana, somewhat, sharp piney-herbal hops, and a hint of alcohol.  The taste is light, mostly sweet with a light bitterness that is more sharp and spicey than truly bitter. It has light fruit, banana, spiciness, a hint of toasted grain, light yeastiness, and a pleasant, smooth alcoholic quality and warmth.

222,695,santa109,4.58,"Stored and served at cellar temperature (53).  A: Poured a light golden with tons of bubbles rushing to the very big foamy head. Large clumps form in the head after a few seconds and stick around until the end. Foamy lacing clings to the glass. Served in the Duvel tulip, it is a beautiful sight.  S: Apples, spicy pepperiness and some other fruity esters.  T: Interesting yeasty spicyness that I can't identify which then fades into a nice hop crisp finish. Yet there is a sweet undertone all along with a bit of fruit on some sips. But on most of them, the delicate spicyness really shines. As it warms (closer to 60 degrees), a bit of medicinal taste appears. A delightful beer.  M: Extremely creamy on the palate with a nice cleansing feel. Carbonation is a bit stronger than average and helps with the cleansing feel. The smooth creamyness from the head is soothing, the perfect mouthfeel.  D: Every sips makes me want to have another. The alcohol doesn't seem to poke through all that much but you can really feel it's warming presence. Although the abv commands respect, I would easily go for another.

The beer itself was a slightly cloudy yellow... I drained the last drop out of the bottle and was pleased to see some rather sizeable chunks floating around in my beer!  Nose: Rather typical of most belgians I've tried... nice banana and spice mingle together.  Taste: Like it smells... lightly toasted malt with a subtile banana and spice (slight clove).

222,695,TheSarge,4.09,"Finally, I have some good Belgian brew to break up the monotony of German lagers and weizens.  Initially poured, this had a clear and pale golden color, but there is sediment at the bottom that clouds up the beer when all the contents are dumped. There's a massive amount of bright white head, and is sticks around for a good while. Carbonation is easily observed in the body of this brew.  There is an arid hoppy aroma, which is nicely countered by a robust malt presence. There's a slight grassy node here, along with a citrus, grapefruit like fragrance.  The taste is immediately citrusy, more of an orange with some rind left on it, as opposed to being totally bitter like a grapefruit.  Upfront, it's a little difficult to detect dominate taste characteristics, due to the massive amounts of carbonation. This has champagne like consistency, as is common with this beer style.  There is definitely a warming effect from the alcohol, but it's not overpowering.  Altogether, this is a great beer and a nice change of pace for me. I'll definitely add this one to my list of favorites.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

A buddy of mine and I had purchased a home-brew kit and followed the directions assiduously. The results actually resembled beer and we were so proud that we painted our first bottle gold and saved it as a trophy for posterity.

Light fruit flavors like apples, pears, and white grapes combine with yeasty spiciness to make a wonderful flavor profile. Some alcohol is detected to let you know that this is a strong ale indeed.

Had a fruity, somewhat apple like, yeast smell.  This is a fantastic beer that offers slightly sweet, but not too sweet malty goodness that's creamy, but a bit dry also. One sip leaves you wanting more. Although it is creamy it's clean and crisp and just a damn good beer.

Looks great!  It has a sweet citrus taste with some bitter at the end. Kinds of a heavy sticky mouth feel but clean. Very refreshing. The alcohol is not over powering at all when served cold. In some ways it resembles founder's devil dancer with out all the green hops over tones.  It smells of flowers, citrus and almost has a cream soda smell going on.

Every time I pour this I try to see how high I can get the head to extend past the lip of the glass. It is pure white with large bubbles. After about 5 minutes it will dissipate around the edges and leave an idea of head floating. The beer itself is a cloudy light gold with champagne-like bubbles right in the middle.  Smell: Spicy and peppery yeast. Just a little fruit sneaking in.  Mouthfeel: Very light and bubbly in the mouth. A little hops but alcohol well hidden.  Taste: Beautiful spicy yeast flavors with some chewy lemon on the swallow. Very well balanced with alcohol well hidden. Pure warmth on the finishing exhale. The inch they have you leave is the bottle is amazingly nutty and yeasty.  Drinkability: Light, crisp and balanced. This one always leaves you wanting another.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,TheDeuce,4.06,"Duvel...finally, in a corked bottle.  Poured into a wine glass, big fluffy head on top of a pale golden color.  Smell of flowers, hops and alcohol, heavenly aroma.  Taste/Mouthfeel is strong, alcoholic, flowery, at the beginning. A slight acid bite appears with lingering sweetness and fluff but a silky smoothness. Varying flavors, almost saison like in the finish.  Drinkability-Complex, a lot going on but smooth and flavorful and overall drinkable.

S: Balance between sweet malts and a bit of yeastyness... lots of fruit notes.. lots of pears and peaches... lots of alcohol comes through though.  T: The taste is very much like the nose... the yeast and alcohol don't quite blend the way many other in the style do it for me.  M: Medium to light body... crisp finish.  D: The taste just doesn't sit well with me... ive tried time and again to like this beer as much as ""im supposed to"" but i find the beer coming up short each time.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Very nice strong head, reminded me of the meringue on a lemon meringue pie. Color was a hazy golden color.  Taste - Smooth, no bitterness at all. Very floral in taste. Best part is that the taste stays with you for a long period.  Aroma - Very Sweet Smell.  Mouthfeel - Gives a clean fresh feeling after impact. Mouth feels super clean.  Overall - Funtastic beer. Really great ale. World Class.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,laituegonflable,4.21,"Pours a light champagne yellow with a very impressively thick head of cumulous white foam. Stealthy but constant carbonation. Thick, sticky lacing. Outstanding-looking beer.  Nose has lots of malted wheat characters. Hints of sour, underripe fruit; cherries, pawpaw and the slightest touch of nutmeg. Very pleasant and complex.  Taste is dominated by sticky wheat malts throughout palate, blended with the same hints of tropical fruits suggested by the nose. A sign of a truly classy beer to my mind when the taste matches the nose so well. The palate is however slightly short, but it's imbued with such assertive pleasant flavours it's definitely worth it. I can bearly tell it's 8.5% as well, it's complex, sweet and rich but the mouthfeel is sticky and wonderful and there is no sign of a vodka-like alcohol burn as I experienced with Lucifer - for example.  This brew yells out that it was brewed by someone who genuinely understands beer. Very, very impressive.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

S - Fruity, like pears or apples, a bit nutty perhaps hazelnut or almond.  T - Fruity upfront followed by an earthly hop that was quite interesting. The linger was very impressive. Very crisp, not all what its cracked up to be, kinda overrated.  M - Light bodied and very well balanced. Left the palate very clean.  D - A slow drinker at 8.5% but very enjoyable and recommended.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Nice slow pour leaves a massive, foamy white head that has great retention and leaves plenty of clumpy lacing. Liquid is a pale, clear golden color. The etching in the bottom of the glass agitates a constant stream of carbonation. S: Ripe fruit (apple), yeast, spice and a little bit of alcohol. T: Very creamy, smooth with very active carbonation. Slightly sweet with taste of ripe fruit, some peppery spiciness and a light hop bitterness. Mild yeast presence in middle and finish with slight tight of alcohol and very clean and refreshing.

222,695,Slatetank,4.75,"Thanks to bierman2000 - poured from two 11.2 oz brown stubby bottles w/ freshness dating of 10/2010 into my Caracole and La Fin du Monde tulips so I could enjoy both bottles at different temps.  Deceanted slowly as directed A - A pristine golden w/ nonstop currrents of bubbles riding the liquid to the snow white head. The head is frothy and whipped w/ a gentle mousse-like smooth texture that is satiny visually under the light.  S - The aroma is both nutty w/ a subtle fruit element that is a yeasty ester w/ traces of Belgian funky character and the spice note is hinted at in the aroma.  M - The strong ale dances as it hits the tongue and with its highly carbonated essence spreads out w/ a dry texture that is preceded by a creamy quality in the feel. Mildly warming w/ a very faint sweet element and hop spiciness.  T - This ale's flavor is both dry w/ the hop and yeast notes rushing forward and a toasty grainy malt that fits perfectly when nestled whithin the other ingredients company. It tastes sweet and creamy w/ a hint of alcohol w/ a fruity tartness that only presents itself momentarily so more hops and spice can be noticed. The crisp malt keeps a central role in the flavor as a fonundation w/ a very pleasant dry malty and spicy blend of flavors. The warming boozy taste is gradually more noticeable, but barely. I found the fuit to be gentle, melon like in the taste w/ such condensed and focused, excellent clean notes in the flavor profile.  D - Very pleasant, legendary in the realm of 'Devil' beers. It took a lot less time to drink 22.4 oz than I would have imagined while reviewing. That is a nice quality considering it is 8% strength. I like the balance of subtle malt, hops and yeast that seems refreshing colder, yet more focused and less disjointed whe it opens up. The aroma and sweetness blossum at closer to 55 degrees and is more pleasant to my taste. A very fine compliment to my filet and asparagus, a second bottle seem mandatory practically.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Slynger,4.7,"Ah, zee Duvel. Beautiful. Pale golden locks which rocks a huge fluffy white head.  Glorious golden orchards greet the nostrils with malty sweet and yeasty, peppery, spice all playing equal roles. The perfect amount of warm alcohol completes an outstanding nose.  The taste doesn't back down a bit. A perfect match of the nose, with an incredible light medium body that brings a messagingly prickly sharp effervescense, while managing a smooth and creamy, warmly carbonated mouthfeel.  Truly the outstanding classic of BSPA's.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,BeerTaster,4.78,Appearance briliant golden yellow huge white head that stuck around for a while. I think the appearance was one of this beers strongest points. Smell I smell Sazz as well as some english hops also had some yeasty notes as well. Taste nice cookie/breadlike backbone followed by a wallop of spicy hops and alcohol.

222,695,IPAcraig,4.43,"Not much more can be said about this libation. This was poured into my Duvel Tulip from a 33cl bottle.  Few beers look as good as this one. It has the biggest imaginable head that never goes away, with a tower of suds that remains in the middle. Perfectly transparent light gold body.  Nice aroma of pears with a hint of spicy peppercorns.  Clean crisp flavor, light fruit with a very dry finish. A wee bit of hot alcohol in the finish.  The beer feels very light and well carbonated; not much else could be expected after the massive head.  I will always go back for more Duvel. I dont get the complexities in this brew like others, but this is still one of the finest beers in the world.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,wschumac,4.73,"330 ml (11.2 oz)bottle drank from Tulip shaped Duvel Glass at around 50 degrees F.  A - When I opened the bottle immediately began burst with energy. Poured mildly cloudy, light amber color but clear after settling. This beer is very carbonated and pour perfectly into the glass with 2"" white foamy head. Head lasted about five minutes remained throughout leaving rings, very dense and frothy.  S - Smells like perfection. Smells almost fruity with a hint of grainy punch. The aroma is complex but simply extraordinary. The aroma creates yearnig for what is to come.  T - Complimentary taste preluded by its smell. Light but strong at the same time. Hidden complexities in this brew. One of the best in creating warming feeling throughout. Slightly lingering aftertaste makes you yearn for more.  M - Velvety and smooth complex feel for such a light looking beer. Head creates feeling of carbonation but smooth from lips to the belly.  D - Excellent all around beer. Fulfilling in every way.

S - Smells almost like sour green apple candy, with hints of green grapes and white wine. Fruity smell of overripe pears and apples. Through all the fruity smells comes the strong scent of wheat and Belgian yeast. T- Very light tasting beginning with lots of wheaty malt tastes and moves towards a complex sour network of fruit flavour, as many as in the nose, but more pronounced as the smell and taste mingle. A nice burn of alcohol emerges as the beer warms, not overpowering and belying the powerful %ABV. Flavours of white wine, green grapes and even grappa, brandy, and light fruity scotch come through in this beer. M - So sparkling and effervescent, tingly and light, beyond refreshing. D - Surprisingly and deceivingly high.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,mikesgroove,4.16,"So here, we have this wonderful brew. No believe it or not, with over 800 reviews I had never done one for this. I was shocked when I noticed this, but to be honest it had been a long time since I had last had a bottle, so I knew I was going to have to pick up another one to be able to review it properly, which is just what I did on the way home last night. Got this 750 ml bottle and took it right out of the cooler section, put it on ice and brought t it home. Served it at around 50 degrees and poured it into a Rodenbach chalice all night to finish this one off.  Appearance - Poured an extremely vibrant and bright straw colored yellow. Very clear, I mean very clear, one of the clearest beers I have seen. An absolutely enormous amount of carbonation on this one. In fact, when I popped the cork it damn near woke up my son. This was a seriously well-carbonated beverage if I have ever seen one. A huge white head, pretty much immeasurable formed across the top and spilled over the sides of the glass coating everything in huge frothy bubbles. This would not fade at all, and I mean at all. There was just a huge pillow like layer of foam across the top of this throughout the session, and it must have literally took close to seven pours before I could fit the whole bottle into glasses. It just would not give up. Huge side glass presentation, leaving sticky blobs of foam pretty much everywhere throughout the glass. The carbonation bubbles were streaming up from the bottom of the glass so quickly and in such abundance, if I did not know better I would have thought it was champagne. Overall, I was very impressed with the look of this one, I could see why people rave about it!  Smell - The aroma was very light and airy, and to be honest much fruitier then I thought it would be, which came as a bit of a shock at first. I had expected a strong grainy Belgian pale, but this was quite nice and light. Waves of light fruit and light grain came over me all at once. Hints of light pear aromas, mixed in with apples were now commonplace. A nice light alcohol smell mixing in and giving it a little bit of depth and letting you know this was quite a bit bigger then you thought it was. Very light cereal and earthy grains coming on now, and just a touch of something sour sitting off in the background, not too strong, just maybe a hint of grapes. Not bad overall, and much lighter then I would have thought.  Taste - The flavored followed along the taste perfectly. A wonderfully light mixture of soft bright fruit flavors that was layered on top of a light alcohol warming with ample amounts of fresh light grains thrown in. Hints of pears and apples were more then abundant here and were really showing off how well this was put together. A nice light cereal grain was the backbone, blended seamlessly with the yeast and a nice light grassy flavor. Some hints at a light sour grape were near the end of it. The finish was very quick and clean, but very dry. It was a weird champagne like dry if you know what I mean, just kinda leaving it all out there.  Mouthfeel - The feel on this was superb as well. Really one of the lightest, and definitely one of the most highly carbonated beverages I have ever had. A very nice blend of flavors really hid the alcohol well and I could have just kept on going with this one as it was just effortless.  Drinkability - As for a nice strong Belgian, this was about as sessionable as you can get. Light flavors were abundant here, really being very bright and expressive and allowing it to be refreshing at the same time that you could be exploratory with the flavors. Really quite well put together and I would have definitely had another when I was done.  Overall, I thought this was outstanding. Now is it worth the hype and the high rating, hard to say. Something does not get such a high ranking after almost 1200 reviews without having something going for it. Are there better ales out there, sure there are, but this is a classic, and will always be. If you are looking to introduce someone to the style this would work perfectly.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,BoitSansSoif,4.38,"A-Light, pale straw with a nice head that lasted until it was almost gone.  S-Fruity notes w/hint of spice and honey. The combination is reminiscent of bubble gum.  T-The malts are terrific, and the sweet aromas make you think the ale is sweeter than it actually is...delightful. There are hints of spiciness, and the hops wash the palate clean at the end. Class act.  M-Medium bodied with perfect level of carbonation. This drinks nicely, goes down smooth, and makes you want more. The alcohol bares itself just before the finish, and it makes me feel good all over.  D-I just had this stuff tonight after several years without. I forgot how good it was. I'm going to stock up next time I'm at the store.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,LittleCreature,4.38,"Appearance - 4.5 Poured four fingers of fluffy cream coloured head that has brilliant retention. Colour is a cloudy pale amber.  Smell - 4.0 Highly floral aroma entices with smells of musk, stone fruit, sweet malt and fruity yeast.  Taste - 4.5 Lower alcohol profile than the 8.5%ABV suggests. Starts with smooth malt, honey, fruit and a little spice. Warming alcohol in the slightly bittter, biscuit-like finish.  Mouthfeel - 4.5 Constant light carbonation and moderate weight in the mouth make the beer go down very smoothly for a strong ale.  Drinkability - 4.5 I could easily go for a second in a sitting, which impressive considering the strength.  OVERALL - 4.4 Truly a great beer by any standards, and one of the most drinkable strong Belgians. The brewery reccommends that 1cm of beer is left in the bottle due to the yeast for fermentation. However, I felt compelled to drink that also after finishing my glass. Delicious!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Palate starts with citrus, again, but the spices are not as defined. Finishes quick. Excellent!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,IgotsHops,4.27,"Picked this up in a large corked bottle. I had heard about this beer but never tried it. Poured out into a wine glass, got a huge 3.5 finger head. Gorgeous golden, crisp color. Strong carbonation Strong banana ester scent, mild (very mild) even hop aroma, light honey-like notes. The banana ester was much more evident when I got half way through the glass and had the space to agitate and swirl the brew around. MAN that banana was strong, clean, and impressive. The taste was that of banana, honey, super pale malt, light bittering hop that was very well balanced. Dry and highly carbonated with a slight warmth from the 8.5% ABV. As I am not a huge fan of the banana flavor, this was quite good for the style, and everyone that tried it agreed that it was exceptional.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,JayQue,4.38,"Wow!!! I lost about an ounce when opening the stubby brown bottle. Huge pillowy white head that holds up throughout. Spicy aroma, Belgian yeasts and astringent citrusy smells.  Tastes like a witbier on steriods. More subtle than some Belgians on the sourness but plenty of complexity and very smooth.  Mouthfeel is rich and drinkability is great.There was a big pillow of head on the bottom of the goblet...kinda like sucking the last bit out of a milkshake.  I could see swilling several of these before I figured out it was 8.5 percent abv.

There were no unpleasant odors lurking about.  Taste started with the citrus flavors, and a little spice, like pepper. I can see how that could detract some people, but I enjoyed it. Finishes with crisp apples.  Very carbonated, which gives it the crisp feeling. Hides the alcohol well and is highly drinkable.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

The beer is a clear honey color with a nice soft floating off white head.  Smell is crisp and has hints of green apples, spicy hops and is all dominated by strong yeasts.  Taste is very well balanced. It has some nice pale malt sweetness that moves into an some fine fruity and yeasty flavors. This beer has a spice that is accentuated by the above average carbonation. All those combined flavors yields a sharp pleasing beer that still has a soft silky, almost creamy texture on the mouth.  This is a beautiful beer well worth the price of admission.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,AleDrinkToThat,4.83,"Appearance: Beautiful pale hazy golden hue, under a fluffy three-finger head. I wish I owned a tulip glass, but a goblet worked for me well enough. The head dissipated really slowly, and left fluffy patches here and there as it laced really, really well down the sides.  Smell: Strong yeast, with honey, tart fruit and hops bouquet. The alcohol makes a strong showing as well, and understandably so!  Taste: The yeast and fruit hit immediately, with the bitterness and alcohol hitting immediately thereafter. The honey hits on the finish, leaving a sweet, delicious aftertaste even when the beer is well on its way to your gullet.  Mouthfeel: Sharp and crisp. The low acidity of the fruit and yeast combined with the high alcohol content make for a fantastic combination of sweet, bitter, and tart.  Drinkability: With the 8.5% ABV, you'd better drink them slowly. You should anyway. This is the kind of beer whose taste you should savor. I loved it, and could drink it all afternoon on a nice mild sunny day (or, let's face it...pretty much anytime). Better walk home, though. ;)",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Okay, I'll say this: Duvel is good, drinkable, and enjoyable. There is nothing 'wrong' with this beer. However, it is *highly* over-rated.  So while there is nothing wrong with Duvel, nor is there anything particularly distinctive or memorable, except for the artful way the 8.5% ABV is hidden.  The beer world has moved on since Duvel's heyday. It's a fine brew, but you can find other ales these days, Belgian or otherwise, that are far more interesting, challenging, and palette expanding.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,JohnnyM2002,4.16,"Sampled from an 11.2 oz bottle, poured into a white wine glass.  A - Pours a beautiful cloudy straw-color with a fluffy white head that leaves behind long-lasting lacing on the glass, all the while a small white ring floats atop the brew. Can't expect any better from the style.  S - Yeast and spices first rise from the glass, and they are quickly met by scents of bananas, pears, and tart apples; alcohol is present in the background.  T - No matter how many times I drink this, I come up with a different description of the taste, so this is as best as I can put it. Initial flavors of yeast, barley, and spices are dominant upon a flowery base. Strong fruit notes of tart apples, bananas, and oranges, with maybe some sweet berries in the background. Full body that reveals new flavors with every sip, finishing with a creamy alcohol tone. In all its complexities, one doesn't lose sight of the many flavors working together - they are just difficult at times to pinpoint.  M - Full, creamy body with strong carbonation and a very strong juicy (but not sweet) finish. Alcohol is present after a few seconds.  D - This is my first time reviewing a Duvel because I could never find the words to describe the whole experience, and I still feel somewhat dumbfounded as to my description...it is definitely something you need to try, but as with everything, drink in moderation and don't underestimate it. It is a very refreshing and crisp beer, so the 8.5% is quickly forgotten about. Suitable for almost any situation/dinner in which white wine would be appropriate - beit a sweet or dry selection.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

It smelled and tasted of fresh, dry fruit, yeast and a bit of alcohol. It was extremely warming and very drinkable for the high ABV. I would recommend this to those who enjoy Hoegaarden because I think it shares a couple flavor notes with it.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Earthy Belgian yeast with lots of citrus and tropical fruit. Sweet candy malts and fresh floal hops.  Again of blend of fresh fruits that yield a delicous balance between sweet and sour. Candy and grain malt with a fresh hop bouquet and tart Belgian yeast.  Thick and creamy texture up front with a crisp dry finish. Just enough carbonation to enhance the flavor profile without getting in the way.  Exquisite example of the style. Vast in complexity while keeping perfect balance. Pairs especially well with seafood and fine cheese.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,DavidSeanNJ,4.73,"I can't believe this is my first time enjoying a Duvel.  Chubby bottle poured into a Duvel tulip (what else??)  A- This is the best looking beer I have ever seen. An incredible massive head emerges from a slow pour, as directed on the back of the bottle. This head might be 3 inches. Deep rich golden color, carbonation bubbles flowing through the middle of the beer, rising quickly and fast.  S- Smell was of citrus zest (mostly lemon)- floral hops and yeast. Alcohol is also noted in the nose.  T- Taste is as balanced as possibly imaginable, with the 8.5 % abv well hidden, but prevalent to those who are not ready for it. A peppery spice mixed in with citrus flavors, hops, and biscuit.  M- Mouthfeel was crisp and carbonated- thirst quenching at times.  D- This is to be sipped and enjoyed.

222,695,DLucky,4.46,"Q: If stranded on a deserted island in the middle of nowhere what beer would you like to have and why? Be succinct.  A: Duvel, because it is the perfect balance of ale flavor and lager finish. And with 8.5% ABV, you won't need much of it to forget you're stranded on a deserted island in the middle of nowhere.  But seriously...  I've been drinking Duvel for over 5 years, I guess it's time to get serious and write a review on the subject.  Appearance: Beautiful innocent straw colored beer with the fluffiest of white heads. Brussels lace clings to the edge of the glass forever, defying gravity until it dries everywhere but where you have taken your last sip.  Smell: Bright, fresh bubbles almost make me sneeze. fruity aromas give way to a deeper, malty odor. Not as much spice as I would have hoped.  Taste: Ma-ma. Full, warm flavors dominate the mouth, filling every nook and cranny. The smallest of hop bites pucker the bottom of my cheeks while yeasty malt flavors really whomp on my tastebuds. Alcohol is present, but neither overly sweet nor linear/hot. Just warming and happy.  Mouthfeel: full, slightly syrupy at first then copious bubbles scrub the pallet clean. near perfect mouthfeel  Drinkability: Could be the single most versatile food beer i've ever had. I have put this up against big flavors, light flavors, desserts, even cooked with it and it just goes with everything. The only reason this is not a 5 in this category is the alcohol content. Ounce for ounce, it is perfect, but very few of us drink just one ounce, eh?

S: strong aromas of apple, yeast, banana, and spice  T: nice floral hoppiness, yeast, rich fruit flavours (apple, pear, stone fruit), a slight touch of sweetness, and a dry spiciness on the long finish - very well put together  M: medium bodied and crisp, sight cream, good carbonation, and a smooth, refreshing, somewhat dry finish.  D: I love this beer! Despite the its high ABV, it's decently easy to drink. However, for me, I prefer to sip slowly and enjoy the complex range of flavours, textures, and physical features that it offers. Truly one of the greatest Belgian Pale ales out there - very highly recommended.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,CrellMoset,4.53,"Served from a .33 L bottle into a Duvel tulip glass. Best served before date 05/2009.  Appearance is absolutely gorgeous. Head is a thick, billowy white, and retention is out of this world. Carbonation is as lively as any I've ever seen, hue is a beautiful yellow gold, and lacing is thick and full. This is how God intended beer to look. For the record, after I had consumed the entirety of the beer, lacing remained on all sides of the glass, and the carbonation kept going until the bitter end.  Nose is airy and light, with the citrus (orange and lemon) and yeast sourness prevalent, and the floral crispness of the hops playing the subdued but nonetheless important part of second violin. Slightest hint of alcohol is present in the harmony.  Taste is indescribable, but I'll try for the sake of the review. It's so balanced, so damn smooth, with the tartness of the fruit and the sourness of the yeast and the bitterness of the hops and the sweetness of the grain and the spiciness of ... something, perhaps cloves, perhaps something else ... all playing off one another, no one overpowering any of the others, each making its own important contribution in concert with the others. The sourness of the yeast and sweetness definitely become more prevalent as this magnificent brew warms up.  Mouthfeel is very smooth, despite the carbonation, which isn't nearly as formidable once it's in your mouth as it appears it probably should be. The finish is outstanding.  Drinkability is superb, and I could finish a four pack easily if the diet I was currently on allowed for it. I'm writing this as I finish off the last few sips (carbonation is STILL going, and there's lacing three and a half inches up the sides of the glass - unbelievable!!), and the alcohol has definitely crept up on me by this point, but you definitely don't feel it until it's upon you. This sets a very high bar for other beers of the style, and I highly recommend this to anyone interested in exposing themselves to Belgian beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,hustlesworth,5,"""pour unhurriedly""  it's been a long time comin.  A- most ridiculously excellent looking snow-white head forms with no effort at all. it's light, airy, and nerf-like and it rises out of the tulip glass and blooms into the shape of a fully blossomed rose. and that's only half the bottle. how can this beautiful thing be the devil? the pour with this beer is a process, and i respect that greatly. this head morphs in a psychedelic fashion into something that resembles the matterhorn, or the K-13 in asspen (for any south park fans) and as the foam sets, it becomes rigid and resilient and rubbery to the touch and leaves groovy geometric fractal patters of lace. body is a pale golden and clear initially, with many streams of tiny champagne bubbles replenishing what the laws of physics take away, then by the end of the bottle we have a beautiful hazy banana peel yellow, still with rising bubblies.  * a dented ping-pong ball size clump of lace is still clinging to the inside of my glass about 1/2in down from the lip...and i finished the beer 1/2 hour ago. i took digital photos, i wish i could post them somehow. i'd give duvel a 5.5 if it was possible.  S- sour belgian yeast and tart citrus, lemony candy, sour apple, pear, sour cherry candy, all in all a very aromatic citric acid. wildflowers, gardenia, and a tropical beach come to mind when taking in the spicy floral hops. pale malt and raw barley also, it is my understanding that the malt is steamed to retain the beer's pale golden color. white wine (reisling, spatlese), oranges and the smallest hint of clove become apparent as the devil warms.  T- ahh where to begin...bubblegum/banana and white pepper spiciness, alcohol hides well but can't escape my olfactory sensors! i know you're there. fine champagne, candied citrus, again almost unnoticeable clove, maybe some mace or nutmeg flavors as well, i'm not sure about anything right now. very belgian, very unique yeast taste is pungent but cleaner in the smell taste and feel than others such as orval. green apple, unripe pear, white grape, all sitting on a very pale, very light malt background. delicious. mildly bitter grassy floral hop finish fades away like a lucid dream.  MF- light, crisp, refreshing feels so much like a pils but most def is not! damn! ranges from tart and puckering to powdery to prickly, to juicy, transitioning flawlessly into an ultra clean finish. finnish! hah! it's beyond my conception at this time how a beer so light can be packed with so much flavor and alcohol.  D- i need to go get a snack and lay down. and then have another devil. i might have to edit this tomorrow with a fresh review. unless all 5's really is possible...it can't be.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

The smell is dominated by lemon and pepper, delicate hoppy spice and ripe summer fruit. The taste is upfront peppery spice, some due to hops but a good deal of it is from the alcohol. Incredibly brash and right out in your face just under the pepper is a fair amount of sweet pale malt along with a lemony tart kick with a bit of yeast ester as well. This beer feels very lively in the mouth clean yet drying with a near stinging peppery bite that invites another sip almost slightly harsh but in a good way.

It never really recedes at all, and large bands of foam stick to the glass with each sip. Color is a clear golden yellow. The etching at the bottom of the glass sends a column of bubbles through the center to the top.  Smell has a distinct Belgian yeast mustiness with a bit of cloves, apples and bananas.

Duvel poured a brilliant straw yellow. It was a very slow pour, and I allowed the head to slowly build. The carbonation was fantastic. A thick, long lasting white head built within seconds. The aroma was a tart apple smell very much like a white Riesling wine. As a matter of fact, the entire ale was quite dry, vinuous and tart. A definite sweetness was detected in the middle, but the skunky, apple esthers overpowered this beer, making it more of a wine than an ale. The finish was dry, with a lingering of juicy fruit and apples remaining.  I suppose this is the King of Belguim Ales, but it's not my cup of tea. A warning, the alcohol will hit the uninitiated.

222,695,letsgopens,4.35,"Poured from a snub nosed 11.2% bottle, this BSPA pours mostly clear with a rich golden color. Attractive, uniform rising bubbles are visible. The frothy, highly effervescent head stand bubbly, tall, and holds very well when decanted roughly. Soapy, spotted lace clings to the glass and the head rejuvenates with a simple swish.  A bit sweet and very yeasty on the nose. Some light honey and fresh, toasty wheat. Plenty of lemon, coriander, and clove provide citric tang and spice. A hint of banana and grassy notes as well.  Formidable and very bright in flavor. Boisterous but still crisp/bright. Spicy and a bit sweet with buttery wheat, doughy yeast, clove, coriander, citrus (lemon), sparkling apple juice, a hint of booze, tart berries, banana, fresh cut grass, and a hint of bubblegum. Pungent and big flavored not to mention very complex. Lots of big Belgian character. Some more yeasty/starchy fruit lingers through the finish.  Again very bright and crisp on the palate with high carbonation. A bit of booze warmth arises especially as the brew warms a bit. Semidry finish with a starchy film that lingers on the tongue (not as bad as it sounds, just reminds you that your drinking a big wheat beer that's all). Very complex and probably the best beer of its style. Tasty is an understatement.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,therica,3.85,"My rating is based on the warning that you'd better let this stuff set for at least 5-10 minutes after pouring, or you'll burn out your nostrils with a biting gas, and your throat as well.  Pour it slowly- as the bottle say, ""Pour Unhurriedly.""  A= nearly clear-yellow, immediate massive head at least equal to the fluid. The head gradually settles, forming chunky thick islands of foam that look like half-melted marshmallows.  S= nice, inviting, florals, evidence of the hops-bitters, slight reminder of lemonade, some bubblegum scent after it's been sitting for 10 or more minutes. Very Belgian-Ale typical. Whiffs of strong alcohol.  T= a little watery for my taste, and yet it rates so highly. Lots of sour-bitter hops, florals, typical trademark Belgian flavor, evidence of its 8.5%ABV alcohol on the tongue.  M= a bit more alcohol-burn than I like, and aftertaste more reminiscent of wine-sour than hops-bitters. A little more watery and lacking balanced flavor and bouquet than I'd like, afterwards.  D= as far as alcohol, not very drinkable in quantity, and for my own personal tastes, there are many other Belgian's that I'd prefer if I were going to knock off a quantity of 8.5%ABV beers.  I've had this in Belgium, where I noted a malt scent and slight sweet hints in the nose, possibly a taste of cardamom, and how it seemed to change character in the taste as it sat, over time.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

This beer is incredibly smooth, crisp, and clean with flavors of lemons and pears. Very balanced, not too hoppy, no to malty, quite refreshing. Drinkablity of this beer is good, however be weary it does sneak up on you. Its called Duvel for a reason.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,SMark,4.5,"I poured this beer from a 330ml brown bottle at 55° into a balloon wine glass. A thick 2 ½ fingers plus white foamy head resulted with nice Brussels lace being left when it dissipated. The coloring was clear and golden with nice carbonation being held under the foam. A best consumed by date was on the back label.  A clean, bitter, off aroma which I credit to the yeast was easily detectible. The beer turned more fragrant and heady with each additional smell.  There was a good mixture of sweetness and bitter with the initial taste. A slight candy sugar lingered in the background.  A musty taste which was not offensive and I lack better descriptors seemed to prevail. There were also a lot of intangibles for me lurking in the background. A slight taste of coriander and citrus fruit was detected with subsequent tastes and swishing in the mouth.  This is another enjoyable beer to be savored and not consumed at the pace of a lighter, refreshing beverage.

After hearing so much about this beer, I was definitely impressed with the appearance... The aroma is so intricate and complex that it is hard to describe... somewhat fruity with a smell of bananas... Taste is equally complex with a nice, pepperish sting to it... The mouthfeel is good, somewhat acidic... and due to the hefty alcohol percentage, wouldn't want to down too many of these bad boys in one night... a distinct alcohol taste is definitely present, and the beer contains a white-wine character... Definitely an interesting brew, though the price is pretty steep... Wouldn't advise to drink too many of these in one setting, best enjoyed occasionally...

A- Murky golden/yellow color and one of the nicest heads ive ever seen on a beer. Very fluffy white head remains and leaves excellent lace mainly in part due to very good retention.  S- Lots of spice and yeast, fairly fruity as well, with mineral aromas characteristic of a pilsner, interesting.  T- Very tasty!! Flavors of fruits up front, green apples, pears, some citrus and lemom. Flavors of yeast and clove caress the tongue, followed by spicy hops midway resembling Saaz hops. Bitter dry finish is surprisingly spicy. Alcohol is hidden, but not unnoticeable.  M- Magnificent! Very smooth with incredibly good carbonation. Effervescent.  D- Fairly good considering the ABV.  Overall I will be grabbing more of this for sure. Awsome beer and one of my favorites. Good for special occasions, just take it easy because the alcohol can creep up on you.

Malty is the first thought that comes to mind, but as you get to the end, it smooths out nicely. I would say the carbonation makes it seems there is more alcohol than what you actually taste.. Great finish.  The malt and alcohol come to the tongue first, followed by the carbonation. Tough to swallow with the first sip, but becomes great as you drink.  I believe I will be drinking another and buying more in the future.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

I let it warm up for 30 minutes and a few bready flavors came through.  Drinkability: Not bad but not particularly memorable. Maybe I got a bad 4-pack?  This beer ended up disappointing me. When I had it several years ago, it seemed to be quite good, but for some reason this time around reminds me way too much of a high gravity malt liquor. I don't taste Belgian yeast notes, I don't taste a good mix of malty flavors.

Picture perfect 2 1/2 finger meringue-like foamy white head and a concentrated stream of bubbles emitting from the bottom of the glass. The color was hazy gold and there were nice lacings clinging to the glass.  The beer had a floral and fruit aroma with a hint of spice. There was a characteristic yeasty nose typical to the belgian style beer.  The taste was crisp and clean, medium to light bodied with a slight bitterness balance by sweetness.

222,695,SeaBiscuiT,5,"This is the best beer I've ever tried in my entire life. I first tried it about 9 years ago on an Irish Pub in Buenos Aires. I instantly fell in love. I friend of mine told me, one of his friends was always reluctant to try this beer, every time his uncle was offering him one. He uncle always said to him ""You have to try a Duvel, you have to try a Duvel"", and this guys was always negative about giving Duvel a try. So finally at a wedding, his uncle brought one for him to his table and he said ""Here you go, now try it"". And this guys said to my friend, that that was a magical moment in his life. The moment he tried it, everything around him changed to a better color almost with a background magical music like the ones you see on fantasy movies. That was life changing for him, and since that day; Duvel became his favorite beer.  When my friend told me that story, I remember that that was pretty much how I felt about 9 years ago at that Irish pub in Buenos Aires.  Since then, Duvel became 'my beer' and I wasn't able to find another beer that taste as good as Duvel. I tried many beers, including Trappist Westvleteren 12, which is ranked #1 here in BA. I like many other ones, and even though I can say La Fin Du Monde is my #2 favorite beer on earth, no other beer came even close to my mouth's soul as Duvel.  The only not positive think I can say about the bottle of Duvel (1 Pint 9.4 fl. oz. / 750 ml) is: it has too much foam when you first open it and you first serve it. You have to wait to your second glass until the foam 'calmed'.  A total pleasure to me is a cold Duvel with salty peanuts. Highly recommended.  Appearance: handsome label Smell: like an expensive perfume without being perfume Taste: like Duvel. No other way to describe it. It's unique. Drinkability: Drink with a lot of respect.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,tlinner,5,"My absolute favorite beer of all time. There's nothing I can say that hasn't been said about Duvel (it's complex fruity taste, accompanying hoppiness and perfect mouthfeel are legendary) so I'll just reinorce the mass consensus that this is a brew that must be in one's repertoire if one is to consider themselves a beer lover. It's remarkably drinkable for a 9% ABV, so watch out not to treat it lightly; and with its distinctive taste and massive head it really separates itself from the pack. There's no doubt in my mind that Duvel is the greatest-tasting readily available beer on the planet, and if you've never had one, you're in for a treat. There's no greater pleasure for me than when I go to the local English Pub with a friend and introduce them to Duvel.  p.s. A word of advice: pour with the utmost care and only ever in a proper Duvel tulip glass, otherwise you'll literally be overwhelmed by the head.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Smell is candied fruit, apples, low amount of yeast (refreshing as a big Unibroue drinker!).  Mouthfeel is perfect. Smooth, with good carbonation. Taste was a bit light at first so I let it warm for the while. Sweet taste hits the tongue first, followed by lots of dryness, citrus finish with noticeable spice. Clean and crisp.

Beautiful pale golden with the most amazing head that I have ever seen on a beer. It looked like meringue, it was so thick. Nice carbonation as well.  Nice pungent smell of yeast and hops. I knew this was going to be a good beer.  Nice clean taste of hops and yeast, just what I expected from the beer. This beer actually followed up a Trappist Rochefort 8 and in my opinion, blew it out of the water. There was absolutely no comparison. Wonderful beer that I will definitely be having again.

Duvel pours nicely, providing a nice, rich white head atop a light golden body. The flavor was clean and crisp, and its dense carbonation reminded me of champagne. Though its taste was decidedly pale ale, it was somewhat sweeter than most pale ales I've encountered. It finished very nicely, with a very slight hoppy aftertaste that I enjoyed. I was very impressed with it overall. It wasn't a beer of which I would have several in a row, but it was a brew I can easily enjoy by itself or with another immediately afterward.

Smell: The nose is a little soapy and earthy with a touch of light malt sweetness. There's a little tinge of funk to the scent as well.  Taste and Mouthfeel: The beer drinks crisp and dry and comes across rather light for a beer of its size. There's hints of nutmeg throughout and there's a mild sweetness from the malts. A good amount of earthy character also makes the bulk of the beer. The yeast lends a decent tart edge.

Smell- Very fruity in the nose, hints of banana, nutmeg, and very subtle hopping, despite the high abv. its not noticeable in the nose.  Taste- For such a heavy abv. its surprisingly light, initial taste is fairly sweet which quickly transforms to a juicy middle with big flavors of perfectly ripe fruit, mango in nature. At the end the alcohol takes over and finishes out. Overall a delicious, well balanced brew.  Mouthfeel- A big creamy beer flavor that really fills the entire palate.

I like this beer a lot, but Belgian strong pale ales are not my favorite. As I have noted, this reminds of a pilsner but with more alcohol. Duvel is one of the best example of a Belgian strong pale ale though.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Patrick999,4.31,"750 ML bottle of Duvel....I admit, I didn't get the pour right until the last pour. Even though I ""poured unhurriedly"" into my Duvel tulip, the beer I poured was almost all head. As I said, I didn't get it right until the end. I don't think there's a tougher beer out there to pour correctly....but once I did so, it's a solid 5 in appearance. Liquid right at the level of the ""Duvel"" lettering, head the rest of the way up.  Smell - big, phenolic aromas, a little cotton candy. Spicy too...Duvel always strikes me as a fairly odd, distinctive-smelling beer. I can't quite put my finger on it.  Taste - that Belgian candi sugar taste, some sour mash, and a fair bit of spiciness. Mouthfeel not as sharp with carbonation as you might think, given the enormous head - goes down with ease.  Drinkability, forget about it. In my opinion, every BSPA worth its salt should score a solid 4.5 or above in drinkability, but this sets the standard. You could, if so inclined, drink this until you pass out. It's a dangerous beer - feels way too light and fluffy for 8.5%. Incredible.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Poser,4.46,"Pours a light golden yellow topped with a thick, foamy head. The top is solid white, thick, frothy and never seems to completely go away. The appearance is just exceptional. Smell is a little more subtle than I would have expected but there are definitely some spices and sweet malts present. Goes down very smooth and creamy with a layered taste that you can't quite explain the first time. There's some sweet malts, some bitterness, even a hint of earthy texture.  If I was stuck on a deserted island with nothing but an infinite supply of Duvel, I would consider myself lucky.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,TheManiacalOne,3.2,"Acquired from grub courtesy of the Birthday Club 2, so a big Thank you goes out to him. Poured from a 330ml bottle into a tulip glass.  A: The beer is a bright yellow color with a large foamy white head that fades very slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.  S: The aroma is of bananas, light malts, Belgian yeast, some spice and a touch of hops.  T: The taste starts out with a strong sourness and flavors of Belgian yeast and spices. Theres a mild hops presence and a thin malt character. The after-taste is slightly bitter as there isnt very much sweetness throughout the taste to counteract the sourness and bitterness.  M: Very crisp and a little smooth, medium body, medium-to-high carbonation, clean and very dry finish.  D: Tasty, goes down easy, not too filling, nice kick, good representation of style, I had tried this beer at a tasting once long ago and didnt like it very much, however, that was before I had tried many Belgian beers. I liked many Belgian beers that I tried since then and realized that I may not have given this beer a fair shot, thus I was anxious to give this beer another try. However, I was disappointed again. I realize now that I simply dont like this beer as much as I appreciate its craftmanship.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Smell: This is the classic (This is going to be a recurring theme) Belgian strong pale ale nose. Fruity esters bring pears and gala apples. Behind that is a musky hoppiness, followed by a touch of pepper. Unfortunately, the aroma isn't doesn't quite pack the punch I had hoped for.  Taste: Whatever the nose lacks in intensity, the flavor profile makes up for. Again, the fruity esters bring pear and apples up front, followed by pepper, and hops in the mid-palate, and some funk-the-funk Belgian yeast before a dry finish.  Mouthfeel: This brew is medium-bodied and dry with soft carbonation.  Drinkability: This is the classic BSPA.

Added a lot to the experience of the beer.  S: Spicey aroma to the beer, nothing overwhelming.  T: Spice is much stronger in the taste than in the smell. The back-taste after swallow leaves a whole different flavor and great taste for this beer. I tend to notice the alcohol on the back end but not in a bad way, and not as strong as is.  M: Very very smooth and dominated by the residual head that sticks throughout.  D: Again, noticed the alcohol but still a beer that is much too drinkable for its 8.5%",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Bubbly lacing clings to the sides on the way down.  Smell -- hops, a light scent, but inviting.  The taste is smooth, buttery, hops and slight bitterness. But it's very well balanced with maltiness and a touch of spices. The mouthfeel is wonderful and this is very easy to drink. It would make a great session beer.

Poured very slowly resulting in a perfectly clear golden color.  S: Juicy acidic fruits along with some floral hops. In the back of my mind I keep thinking witbier. Slight presence of alcohol.  T/M: First taste makes me think witbier, too. Has a strange tasting bitterness to it that leads to the alcohol and big medicinal phenols. Citrus twist at the end for a dry finish. Higher carbonation makes it pretty light on the palate.  D: Has a very different taste than what I was expecting. It's not bad but not something I'll get often. Easy to drink and refreshing, though.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

The smell is great; citrus (especially orange), hoppy. Very nice.  The taste has a fairly strong hop flavor to it; to me the bitterness of it is very minimal and there is a nice balance of carbonation. It has a strong citrus taste to me. It is almost like a really nice champagne.  Overall I would give this a 4.5 out 5. It is really complex and big tasting. You have to give it a couple of sips to really get a lot of the complexity out of it.  I would recommend it to anyone.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Overly carbonated.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,PittBeerGirl,4.73,"Poured into my Chimay chalice; Unfortunately it only held 9 or so of my 11.2 oz of Duvel. Without the last two ounces this brew was pretty transparent and just looked like another tripel so I drank just enough to get the rest of the bottle in the glass and the last 2 oz. really made a difference in appearance and mouthfeel. I'm going to have to get myself a Duvel tulip glass.  A-Very cloudy translucent pale golden yellow body that pours with 2 fingers but eventually fades to a wonderful 1 finger smooth and creamy white head. Lots of lacing is left behind in the glass. A volcano of tiny bubbles constantly rises to the top the whole time. Cloudiness is uniform but yeast sediment can be seen constantly stirring with the bubbles.  S- This brew has a great smell but it doesn't show as much promise as every other characteristic. The smell is rather light. What dominates the nose is a combination of spicy yeast and spicy hops with a hint of hop bitterness. What I would expect from a good saison but it doesn't highlight the complexity of this brew.  T- A wonderful balance of citrus, peppery spice, pear, spicy yeast, and a bready yeast sweetness upfront. The finish is much more dry and clean cut with a bouquet of bittering and refreshing hops making their presence along with a peppery spiciness and the slightest presence of an alcohol acidity/warmth. What lingers is a magnificent combination of yeast, spiciness, and just a touch of bitterness and sweetness.  M- Amazing. Medium carbonation and light body. Texture is delicate and velvety-very smooth and creamy. The mouthfeel even lingers with the taste. excellent.  D- Well after the initial pour and throughout this review I only have one sip or two left of the Duvel. 11.2 ounces was certainly not enough of this brew. This is an excellent example of a BSPA (my favorite style) and one I will purchase again and again. The ABV is almost undetectable and this is one that's complexity will have you sipping and sipping again.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Full body to this one with the feel of the spices with the pepper to it. This is an excellant beer,just sit down and relax and enjoy,the flavors all blend in just superb with just the right touch of spices and bitterness and that creamy feel to it.The 8.1% alcohol,hell man,you can't even tell.Duvel is a little on the pricey side but worth every penny.Do give this one a try,well worth it...excellant!!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,BlackHaddock,4.38,"I was suprised to see I hadn't reviewed Duvel when I checked the Best of BA list the other day. I thought I had better get round to it.  All the best superlatives have been used by other BA drinkers and I don't want to copy anyone. So this is just an amble type of ramble. Needless to say, I think this is a fantastic beer and have scored it accordingly.  I started drinking Belgian beers on a regular basis back in 1993 and I have always thought Duvel to be a great beer and a leader within the stronger Pale Ales produced in Belgium.  I have two Duvel glasses and there are always some bottles in my garage waiting to be cooled and drunk. My local supermarket (Morrisons) has Duvel on offer at £4.00 for three .33 litre bottles, that's about $8.00 at todays exchange rate.  Being a member of the CAMRA Investors club means I have a few shares of the Duvel Moortgat brewery (part share of $67,000) and have had the pleasure of visiting the said brewery in 2005.

Sweet, slightly grainy and yeasty flavor followed by the slightest hint of alcohol.  M- Slightly thin and extremely carbonated.

222,695,gmcfarre,4.92,"11.2 oz stubby bottle poured into New Belgium Chalice  A - Wow, I ever-so-carefully poured this beer into my chalice. Seeing that the head was rapidly rising I stopped about halfway through the bottle. After a few seconds of looking at BA.com, I turn back and the head is billowing out of the goblet and onto my desk. I've had Duvel and other Belgian Strong Pale Ales many times and never seen this happen.  Ok, the head has settled a bit and left amazing lacing and an intense rockiness that remains at about 1 inch throughout. Body color is light, golden straw and somewhat clear. Head is eggshell white. A beautiful beer once it is reigned in.  S - A floral bouquet of light hops and well-presented spice to match. Flavors complement each other incredibly well. Light citrus and pepper come to mind. Alcohol is well hidden.  T - Smooth, slight lemony citrus kick things off with a bit of malty sweetness to boot. Belgian spices come to play in the form of pepper and perhaps coriander. Alcohol becomes more present as this beer warms, but its spiciness never contrasts with the other flavors, it only complements them. A real joy to drink with its subtle complexity that combines to form a delicious whole.  M - Moderate carbonation adds a lively punch to an otherwise light, smooth and somewhat creamy beer. Aftertaste leaves much flavor to be admired, but little in the way of a drying bitterness.  D - A classic beer that I have enjoyed many times but never reviewed. Although it has always been tasty, this beer really shines when you are actually thinking about the flavors and how they complement one another. A must-try and the definitive Belgian Strong Pale Ale.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Maracuja,5,"This beer poured perfectly clear until the end of the bottle when the yeast was roused. A perfect decant was not possible as the head was literally rising out of the glass! Hazy yellow-gold body with an orange-cast topped by a dense, rocky bright-white head that holds extremely well - buoyed by a tight-beaded effervescent carbonation - and leaves some exceptional lace. Aroma is quite fragrant: fruity, yeasty, candy sweet and malty, lightly peppery with a touch of spicy hops. The body is light/medium with an extremely fine and highly effervescent carbonation that is pillowy soft and velvety smooth in the mouth. The flavor is surprisingly full and rich, starting with a candyish malty sweetness, becoming dryish in the middle with some earthy and lightly spicy hop flavors, and finishing long and malty with some more distinct Saaz notes and touches of bitterness. The alcohol is amazingly well hidden. Impressively balanced with a fresh hop presence and bitterness that dances amongst such sweet malt character. Amazing. As Michael Jackson notes, Duvel is equally impressive served chilled, or as it warms toward cellar temperature. This makes it quite drinkable, and enjoyable, as a glass can be savored over a period of time. One of my favorite beers in the world, and absolutely recommended.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,dnichols,4.48,"Poured a 330 ml bottle into a mug.  A: Pours a clear, bright, and light gold with a massive head that intially takes up more space than the liquid (five fingers or more). The head is sticky and leaves curtains of lace down the inside of the glass.  S: A complex and pleasant aroma. I can pick up some fruit, malt, and yeast.  T: Combines both sweetness and spiciness. The sweetness has fruity hints of pears and Jonathan apples, with a dollop of honey. The spiciness is influenced by a white pepper flavor that complements the breadiness. Very enjoyable.  M: Smooth and refreshing, sweet and sharp, and complex and balanced.  D: Spot on. Carbonated and smooth. Kicks a little--while being very refreshing. No lingering bitter aftertaste and no overwhelming sweetness. . Comment: I have passed this beer over in the pastbut no more.

222,695,ThatWineGuy,3.8,"Purchased four hours ago and it got mixed up on the drive home; the yeast is well distributed, I probably should have waited at least a day or two to let it settle before opening. I used a Chimay goblet. Exp date Jan 2010.  Pale and pretty much see-through hay colour. High fluffy white head started at three fingers and never went below one or two. Effervescent carbonation, fast rising tiny bubbles. Smell of yeast, hops plus, sour dough, over ripe fruit, maybe peach or banana. A full, chewy mouth feel but with sharp acidity. The taste had me going: cinammon, thyme, more over-ripe fruit but the bitterness has an edge that is sharp and abrupt. I thought the finish was disappointing, not what I anticipated on opening. it reminded me of banana peel. There was some spice in the aftertaste but again with a lot of fermenting fruit sourness.  The 8.1 per cent alcohol was plainly evident and blew me away. I wondered if this was opened prematurely and just needed to mature.

Don't really taste the alcohol at first, but it seemed to settle to the bottle of the glass as I got a decent sized mouthful of it later. Still, tasted very good.  M: Nice and light and pretty refreshing for a high ABV beer.  D: Definitely a good, drinkable beer. Smooth, great tasting, and very refreshing.

222,695,illidurit,4.41,"I realized I hadn't drank any Duvel since getting a Duvel glass, so I thought I'd revisit this classic properly.  The 'perfect pour' according to Duvel's website comprises liquid halfway up the lettering and head from there to the rim of the glass. I manage this feat effortlessly, confirming the spot-on engineering of the trusty tulip. The beer is clear pale gold and the head is a bright dense white. The head is so perfect in this glass that even though it's about 3 inches high, the liquid slips right underneath as you tip the glass, saving my nose and upper lip from an embarrassing beerstache.  Smell is appley, flowery, yeasty and sweet. Banana phenols and hints of spice and pear.  Taste is of green apple and soft mellow fruits, citrus twang, wheaty malty background with floral and herbal hops. Phenols and spiciness are in the flavor as well as the smell.

The flavor profile is very nice, if not hugely impressive. Good, if somewhat understated, flavors of apple and melon. The beer has some moderate sweetness, with just enough bitterness to keep it all in check. The beer has a nice clean finish, with the 8.5% abv. well disguised. The beer is surprisingly drinkable.

222,695,BucBasil,4.83,"Appearance: Poured into the Duvel Tulip from the stubby bottle. ""Pour Unhurriedly"" the label told me, before explaining how I should prepare this precious brew. I followed the instructions, and what resulted was a full four-finger perfectly white, sparkley head that went right to the edge of the tulip. This magnificenthead sat atop a pure golden liquid. And when I say ""pure gold"" that's what I mean. A jet stream of bubbles risies from the middle of the bottom of the glass, due to the ""D"" etching in the glass. Fantastic.  Smell: Delicate honey sweetness. Crisp apples and clean alcohol finish out the nose. Very inviting, very clean and refreshing. There is a bit of hop twang somewhere in the mix there.  Taste: Creamy honey gives way to a light fruity taste, then finishes clean with a hint of spice and hop. As good of a taste as I could ask for, progressing through each new taste slowly, allowing its complexity to shine through. Mouthfeel is very crisp, and can become excessively so (biting) at times, revealing this beers only weakness in my eyes. However that fact says a lot about the quality of this beer, and the mouthfeel is still lightyears ahead of most beers out there right now.  Drinkability: This beer is ridiculously drinkable, making its 8.5% ABV that much more dangerous. I could go all day drinking this stuff, and I think that's why it's called the Devil. Duvel translates to ""Devil.""  Notes: Duvel is about as perfect a beer that I can think of. I often use it as a reference when reviewing other beers, and I think it exemplifies what a fine golden ale can be. Everything progresses naturally from pour to last sip, and creates a total sensory experience that must be experienced to believe. Also, this beer is incredibly available. I have found this beer at most stores I've been to, from ABC to several local liquor stores. If they don't have it, request it.

Took a long time to settle before I could pour the rest of it in the glass. Even after having about 2-3 minutes to settle after first being poured the head was still over an inch thick. The beer itself is a nice cloudy light to medium golden color. the beer has very excellent lacing indeed. Has a fairly malty aroma along with some lemon and apple perhaps along with some spice. The taste is malty and sweet upfront with some fruit hints. Apple, banana, and citrus are present, followed by a trace of hops. It has crisp and frothy medium bodied mouthfeel. Moderate to heavy carbonation. Very easy to drink in the manner that great beer should be. This is one of the best Belgian beers I have ever had.

222,695,brewone,4.55,Nice floral note right off the bat. Slightly sweet with just a touch of hop aroma. Also a slight phenolic spice aroma Thick white rocky head. The beer itself is nice pale gold color and crystal clear. Beautiful lace left on the glass through the end of the beer. Flavor - slight bitterness noticeable along with a phenolic spicyness. Slight malt sweetness and flavor. Nice light malt and mild hop aftertaste. Taste some florally continental hops used. Saaz? Light body with clean spicy finish. Slight alcohol warmth. Very nice drinkable ale. I wanted another before the first was done. The aftertaste is very pleasant. I love the spicy floral hop flavor and aroma. Leaves me wanting more.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

S: Spices, some lemon/orange, somewhat medicinal.  T: Lemon and other citrus upfront, pears, yeast esters, with a hoppy finish that is quite understated, from the Bohemian hops which are mentioned on the label.  M: Smooth, dry, spritzy, creamy, and phenolic.  D: Very good for an 8% beer, a classic of its style, Duvel is a great beer, quite simple really, but quite delicious.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,entheogen,4.78,"I don't know why I put off this beer for so long. I feel like a massive idiot now.  Upon cracking the bottle and pouring, I got a 3 finger off-white head in a tulip glass. The beer itself is pale straw color and crystal clear, with streams of bubbles running from the bottom of the glass. The bubbles making up the head are very uniform in size. Nifty.  I smell malt and sour green apple, mostly.  It tastes tart, fresh, and dry, and is very effervescent. Fresh flavors like straw, with fruity additions like bubblegum and pear. Snappy alcohol at the finish that does not feel hot. Delicious and never overbearing. Duvel is very smooth in the mouth. I will be coming back to this one for sure.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Perfect look to this beer in my tulip glass, pale golden straw color with a big fluffy and carbonated head - perfect 10. Aroma is fruity with some green apples. Taste is awesome, crisp and fruity like champagne, and this beer is evil (named after the devil and all), slipping in the alcohol, which is unnoticeable. Refreshing but a sipper.  This is one brew that lived up to the hype. Mmmmm, evil beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Pops like a bottle of chamapne, pours a golden yellow with massive head, thick, rocky, and left large amounts of lace. Smell is of sour citrus, some alcohol, and other fruits, I swear I detect some banana and at times reminds me of a hefe. Taste is superb, thats the only way to describe. High carbonation and an almost creamy feel to it. This might be the best beer I've every had so I dont have too many words to describe it other than that. Only a 4 for drinkability as it does pack a punch to it so a couple glasses of this and I couldnt handle any more.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,TheDragonTony,5,"330 ml Bottle says it is best before January 2010. Opening the bottle I could feel the pressure release and even with a gentle pour I got 3/4 of a glass full of head, cloudy white head that would be absolutely wonderful if it wasn't dominating my glass completely.  Appearance: Wonderfully golden and clear with exceptional carbonation bubbles flowing freely up my glass, and the aforementioned beautiful white head.  Smell: Yeast and some hops are present, but mostly I smell apples and pears.  Taste & Mouthfeel: Silky smooth and very creamy. The active carbonation makes this ambrosia quite crisp as well. Hop bitterness up front, very fruity in the middle with spicy malt and esters as well. Finishes with a nice dry note.  Note: This is easily one of the best beers that I've ever had. Beyond that if the name (Devil) is anything to go by it is a compelling reason for me to sin more. Hmm... maybe I will take the label's advice and try to drink the rest of this four pack with ""good-looking strangers.""",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Not sure if it was the glass, but did have the strings of bubbles stringing from the bottom to the top much like champagne.  Light residual lacing, thick wet foam dissapears after a minute  Beautiful transparent gold color, scent of Jasmine and Chrysanthemums  Initial hint of bitterness followed with light malty flavor. Hints of spice; pepper/cloves, very crisp.  Dry finish, bitterness that follows through the throat.

Massive white angel-food-cake head billows up and lives forever; an iceberg of cream sits in the middle with big bubbly arcs all over the glass. Aroma reveals rich and sweet bread / dough malts, fruit and musty yeasts, and distant hop spiciness. Cream and flowers throughout. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and sharply effervescent with a dry quality. Flavor is well-matched to the nose with the addition of a considerable sourdough malt quality; notes of lemon and pepper from the hops. Aftertaste is primarily sour and tingly.

Huge blobs of lacing on the glass. Has a clear golden color that becomes rather hazy when the sediment makes its way in.  I do not have a great nose but this beer is powerfully fragrant with some floral hops, yeasty spiciness, just a touch of horse barn and alcohol.  A strong but delicate beer on the mouth not overwhelming but very complex. Slightly sweet and creamy with some bitterness, notes of light floral hops, a bit of sweet malt and a nice yeasty tang.

The wonderful head leaves behind strong lacing. I'd give it a 5.5 if I could.  S - Rich, creamy bubblegum yeast, sour cherries, earthy wheat stalks and some spicy peppery spices. Alcohol is slightly detectable.  T - Taste starts fizzy and thick, then the yeast takes over; bready and creamy and thick on the mouth with a bite, but different than a hop or carbonation bite. There's a short cherry-like sourness in there just before the finish, which is a thick yeastiness.  M - Medium to thick consistency with very slightly elevated carbonation.  D - Overall a solid beer. I'm glad I bought 4 of them.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Huge, gigantic, fast rising head. Head is very white. Good head retention, & good lacing.  Taste: Lemon, pepper, clove, banana, orange peel... it tastes just like it smells. There is some sort of malt flavour here as well, but it is hard to describe & it definately takes back seat to all of the yeasty flavours.  Mouthfeel: medium bodied. The carbonation is crisp, prickly, & plentiful. It has a drying effect on your mouth.  Overall, I like it very much. It is a spicy, yeasty, yummy Beer. I will have some more in the near future.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Flavor starts off with bright maltiness; bringing lots of bread and honey. There is some crisp apple in the middle. Finishes abundantly spicy: spicy alcohol, spicy phenols, and spicy (and grassy) hops. Finishes dry with a nice finishing bitterness.

The brown stubby bottle had clear freshness dating and some informative tips on how to pour.  The beer pours with a massive & dense chiffon like white head. Excellent lacing. The beer its self is a light yellow.  The nose is a mix of spices, yeast, straw and malts.  The taste is a bit sour with white pepper, malts and wet straw. There is a bit of pears and the hops come late but are evident.  The mouth is blessed with great carbonation.

Cork went off with a bang, and into the cup with an eternal excess of foam, that had the texture of whipped merengue. It was majestic on the surface, delicate, irregular peaks formed spontaneously. Racing carbonation was visible in the hazy golden ale.  Smell was lightly fruity pear yeast esters, with a light spicy grain element.  It had a delicate, effervescent feel that was perfectly balanced by a light maltiness, followed by pear and apple notes from the yeast. Dry finish, high on the drinkability scale. Duvel seems to be universally appealing to beer fans, wine drinkers, foodies, and even the adventurous macro drinker.

222,695,basica,4.35,"I had a second Duvel quite a while after my first one and this time I tried it Oosters. Duvel pours out with a thick lasting head. Emanating from the mouth of the Duvel Tulip glass was a nice aromatic yeasty, spicey smell which translates to a nice wheat and yeast tasting beer with a clear dash of spices which probably includes corriander. I could really appreciate it this time as compared to the first time when I had it. The taste was satisfyingly strong with a closed to full body mouth feel. Carbonation was average and the 8.5 ABV felt surprisingly drinkable. The finish was slightly dry and the after taste seems to be more on wheat and spices. It was sad that the after taste was not as strong and not really lasting on the pellate. The first time I had the Duvel, I felt that it was slightly bitter and the alcohol seems to kick in fast. Duvel was my first strong Belgian ale and perhaps back then I had not developed the correct form of appreciation for this kind of beer; now I have.

The taste has a malt front, notes of pears and apricots, and then a...now take this the right way...pleasant soapiness to it. Seriously, it tastes like soap smells but in a good way. The finish has a nice refreshing hop bite. Definitely the best of the style. The mouthfeel is silky with a nice carbonation (no wonder) to break the whole thing up nicely.

Definitely a favorite.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Poured into a snifter from a 11.2 oz. bottle, which took almost 10 minutes to pour, due to the huge head it created. The beer poured a clear almost white color, settling to a light gold in the glass. Huge thick creamy white head, that very slowly dissipated, with thick spots of lace on the glass. The aroma is slightly fruity. The flavor is not as complex as expected, but still interesting. Fruity flavor, I'm assuming from the yeast, along with a slight hop presence. Light mouthfeel, along with a not-so-smooth finish. The beer had a slight hop-harshness at the end, but still this is a very drinkable Belgian. I can see why it is so popular.

S: An outstanding aroma comes off this beer. Wonderful pear and orange fruity ester nose. Perfumy hop aromas compliment. Alcohol aromas are soft and perfumy. Malt character just peeks through. Peppery phenols also just peek through.  T: Malt flavor is pretty strong and adds good backbone. Fruity esters are strong - citrus and a little pear. Sweet alcohol flavor present. Light phenolic character weak. Dry bitter finish. Very complex.  MF: Medium though seems lighter because of high carbonation. Some alcohol warmth.  D: Excellent.

222,695,bluemoonswoon,4.07,"Maybe I'm being a little harsh here but this was my personal experience with this beer.  11.2oz bottle poured slowly into oversized wine glass (the glass was sitting upside down in a cupboard for some time, I gave it a smell test and seemed clear but for some reason I feel that this beer was contaminated in some way by the glass, I'll rinse out next time for sure)  Head forms almost as soon as the beer hits the glass, the end result is three fingers of pure white pillowy head coupled with a clear yellow for the beer itself. It seemed a little too clean and a little to bland for my taste but I only say so because of by preference for darker beer, the head was beautiful though...  Smell is quite nice and complex. Upfront is the yeast and malt which impart a sweet cookie-like aroma to the beer, later on with a bit of agitation get some faint floral aromas from the hops.  Bubbles hit right away and a little too overpowering for my tastes as it made it a little harder to get my finger on a specific taste. My gut tells me sweet biscuts upfront, malty flavor in the middle with a little fruit, bananna and apple on the tail end with a hit of hazelnut, still no easy task with the carbonation that hits upfront.  The longer I drink this the more it seems like I'm drinking milk, take that for what it's worth I guess. Not a bad or good feeling, it's just lingering.  All in all a very drinkable beer, but I think I would like to give it another go for a deeper appreciation.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Good yeast smell too.  Taste- Nice citrus up front with a complex finish, floral notes hit at the end as does the hops. Very well balenced beer. You can tell they-ve been making this one for a long time. Great example of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale.  Mouthfeel- lots of bubbles, delivers the flavor well. Gets better as it warms up.

The appearance is nothing short of spectacular: golden liquid with huge pillowy head, nearly spilling from the top of the glass. Smell is of foural hops.  The taste is unlike anything else. A sharp bitterness is immediately apparent, I can only assume comes from the hops, though I don't know what kind is used.  The mouthfeel is one of the best I've ever had. Sharp carbonation seems to scrub every are of your mouth. Even after witnessing the huge head, the level of carbonation is surprising.

T - The first sip explodes in the mouth, overwhelming me... very bold profile. Sweetness is quite low and it has a very dry finish. I'm finding it hard to describe the distinct flavours... also has a bit of an alcohol note.  M - Almost champagne like. Sprtizy, light and dry.

A: The color is a pale golden hue, it looks almost like a macro lager. Very clear as my careful pouring left all the yeast in the bottle.  S: Lots of yeast, some alcohol as well as some light fruit.  T: Some light pepper as well as the light fruits. A very nice balance between the sweetness, the slightly bitter hops and the pale malts. Warming alcohol at the end, but not nearly as much as one would expect with the 8.5%.  M: Not as syrupy as some other Belgian pales that I've tried. It has an exceptional mouthfeel: medium bodied, great carbonation, creamy yet smooth and at the same time crisp and clean.  D: A very drinkable and refreshing beer for all the alcohol is packs.

M- Creamy and sweet.  D- A very enjoyable beer. I have had this beer before, but I have never slowed my drinking down to enjoy the nuances of this ale.

Rocky foam over pale straw-gold, bubbles, lacing as foam slowly recedes. Aroma is just fantastic, pils malt with a tantalizing phenolic spice. The phenolics are quite evident during the first taste. The finish is dry, with noticeable alcohol. In the mouth, there is a thin lightness, the digestible character of Belgian brews that Ive read about.  I am drinking it unpaired with food, but on a full stomach. Its malty and spicy aroma and crisp flavor work well all by itself, but I dont think Ill drink another right now.

S: spicy aroma with a hint of hops.  T: has a spiced pear flavor, moving into a light malt taste mixed with some bitterness and ending with a bitter aftertaste. The spicy/light pear flavor tends to dominate the rest with the bitterness complementing it.  M: very light for a heavy beer, well-carbonated and effervescent.

It will stick around for a while, giving you a chance to admire the color and the aroma.  The taste is not overwhelmingly of alcohol, even with it's 6%+ ABV. It feels nice on the tongue, with moderate carbonation. If you drink this from the bottle, you get a much different feel than if you drink from a glass after a proper pour to release the gas.

It has a pale golden shimmer highlighted by a fantastic array of dancing carbonation. The head is a perfect white that stays forever. It's so firm you'll think is a meringue.  Smell - It has a refreshingly smooth aroma. A subtle sweetness captures this sense and begs to taste.  Taste - The first mouthful is unexpectedly awkward. After a few sips it fits exactly where I want it to, and is very hard to put it down. It starts off sweet and finishes bitter.  Mouthfeel - The carbonation creating the action upon the pour comes back to haunt it causing a coarseness on the tongue.

The aroma is of wheat and spices initially. As the beer warms some more citrus notes become apparent and maybe some banana.  The taste is very complex. Initially taste strongly of wheat, but as the beer lingers on the tongue it becomes tart and spicy. Alcohol sweetness is also present. I would not mind having this beer anytime.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,BuckSpin,4.4,"Presentation: 11oz bottle in (what else?) a Duvel tulip glass!  ASIDE: Props to the Moortgat family who, on the reverse of the bottle's label, give proper pouring advice, temperature recommendation (40-50F) and this lovely suggestion to ""...enjoy with discerning friends or good looking strangers""!!!  Opened with a PFFT, and initially poured (s-l-o-w-l-y) with an almost steak on the grill like sizzle sound, crisp, lite, full of vitality. Strong yeast up front, spicy with soft clove, a trace of coriander, excuse of white pepper, sweet alcohol, summer straw. With some air citrus fruits like grapefruit & pineapple are detectable. The nose continues to grow & bloom. This is nice just taking time to savor the developing bouquet. More time and the malts roar back, strong straw & hay are present as well as some apple cider hues.  Head is downright insane - easily 3 fingers (even pouring s-l-o-w-l-y) of super thick, sticky, tight, pearl white foam that looked like a winter mountainscape of sculpted peaks. Lacing is staccato & curtain like.  The body is a slightly hazed, lemon kissed pale golden hue, a nice parade of bubbles rising from the beveled D in the glass bottom. Much love went into making this a sensory treat.  Mmmmm...light, crisp, clean. The yeast play with the grapefruit qualities, a pleasing, cider dry, almost sour bite....nice. Malts are bready, dry crusts off artisan loaves, slight straw/hay accent. Its a bittersweet dryness with a soft crunch on the palate. There is a lot going on, a very complex ale. Its not requiring me to be a sipper, but definitely demands, or commands the respect of, some pacing...which is fine with me. I like it when a beer sets the pace, not I. Where am I going in a hurry anyway?  The clove & coriander take a more assertive stance on the palate, dancing atop a floor of those summer fields malts which have flattened to a bittersweet composite. Hops come alive, and the whole dance company sings farewell in a deep, sad voice, leaving in a bitter aria with an encore of an aftertaste that grows with warmth and heat (very nicely in the background until this point), coating the mouth & teeth in a fuzzed, sticky, chewy residue, almost like it wants you to be sad its gone.  Bravo to Duvel. An incredibly complex beer. This was very enjoyable, and there were no dead spots from pour to gulp. This is a beer I could see revisiting again & again, to try to learn more, to enjoy again, to fall siren to its amazing simple song. An outstanding beer. I am fast becoming a Belgian Strong Pale Ale fan. Highly recommended, dare I say almost ""required"" drinking to grasp the genre.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,sleazo,4.21,"From Fresh Direct  A-Golden clear with a huge soapy head, lots of lace with a steady stream of bubbles keeping the head alive. Gorgeous, this is what a beer should look like. I would like to confuse some American macro drinker with the colour.  S-Candy sugar, followed by a perfume like alchohol. There is also some hints of clove, pepper, slight banana and faint sour yeast.  T-A little more bitter than the smell. Still the first sip hits you with some sweetness then you get a bitter follow through and plenty of that spice on the end. The aftertaste leaves those spices with black pepper being the dominant flavour. The alcohol pervades the taste and is a presence.  M-Creamy with a lovely ammount of carbonation. Almost the perfect motuhfeel for a beer of any style.  D-The alcohol is perhaps a little too much in the forefront which hurts the overall drinkability. This however is a masterful beer that is in my rotation. Plus fresh direct delivery is a good thing.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,RedChrome,4.28,"Crystal clear very light golden yellow color. Creamy pure white head of over two inches took over ten minutes to settle down. Carbonation is jubilant enough to obscure vision through the glass. Lacing clumps are huge and pillow like.  Aroma smacks with spices and very crisp light fruit scents. Apple blends with a light white pepper in the major smell. Earthy malt has a hay like quality. Overall light and fruity on the nose.  Crisp grapes abound with a light peppery apple finish. A slight secondary flavor of earthy grass develops in the back of the mouth. There is an faint light hops bitterness, but it dies quickly to the sweetness.  Clings with a carbonation burst to all the surfaces. Light on the tongue but sturdy enough to retain the flavors.  A great beer in the style. This one would work excellent when paired with lox. A must try for anyone who is looking towards the style, and a solid hit for anyone with a taste for beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Word of caution...pour slowly. When I had this at a restaurant in Cooperstown, NY, the waitress was a bit rushed in the pour as wasted several ounces...it was tragic. S: Very nice hop aromas, slightly sweet. A nice ""prequel"" of the taste to come. T: This is what pale beer should taste like...nectar of the gods. Perfect blend of hops, barley, malt & yeast. The bottle conditioning gives a slight boost to the flavor. M: High carbonation gives a moderate tingling; good aftertaste and an enjoyable experience. D: Very drinkable and always enjoyable. I first had this many years ago in Switzerland, then again 2 years ago in Cooperstown. It has only been in the last year that I've been able to find it here in Omaha.

222,695,buliwuf,4.45,"Presentation - stubby, 11oz dark brown bottle with the words ""pour unhurriedly"" and instructions on how to do so  Appearance - a brilliant, clear yellow, like a cheap lager, yet with copious amounts of carbonation. But even poured slowly, which I thought I was doing, a massive, thick, meringue-like head formed and nearly overflowed the glass.  Nose - a tart, flowery, spicy aroma, with a yeasty undertone. Some fruit coming through, though what I cannot say with any accuracy, maybe pear and apple.  Mouthfeel - crisp, dry, light, and very carbonated  Taste - wowwhat was just described in the nose meets the palate and then starts working together in a symphony of flavors. A sharp, apple-like flavor comes in at first and is over taken by a yeasty undercurrent, only to be replaced by a peppery spiciness that is sourish at the same time. Extremely complex and difficult to describe. There are still chunks, literally, of foam sitting on the surface of beer, despite the glass nearly being empty, and the entire glass is laced over from top to bottom.  Overall - Well-deserved for its reputation and definitely a standard-bearer for the style. A must-enjoy beer for Belgian aficionados.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

White, thick, foamy head is generally rocky, and laces the glass.  Smell: Mild aroma of spices, yeast, and some malts. A bit of alcohol seemed present as well.  Taste: Has a spicy malt taste to the beer. The spices I presume come mostly from cloves, hops, and the alcohol. There's a bit of undefined fruits and yeasts in the background too.  Mouthfeel: Light- to medium-bodied; generally smooth. Carbonation is soft yet tingly.  Drinkability: The finish is a bit harsh with the alcohol, but it never really comes out to bite you.  Though it's an enjoyable beer, I usually find Duvel far from impressive. It is, of course, manditory to try for those who enjoy Belgians, and I'll certainly have it again, but it is hardly near the top of my list.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

S - Suitably complex, start getting wheatiness followed by citrus fruits but there is a hint of underlying bitterness. A beer that truly deserves a decent ""nosing"".  T - Creamy and with masses of flavour. Fruity with a lingering bitterness from the hops. Warming alcohol in the finish.  M - Very smooth and lots of carbonation. Has a dryness also.  D - Feel my rating is a bit harsh here but this really is an intense beer. Taking into account the alcohol content having more than one seems to be a waste. One is very drinkable though.

Smell - In my opinion, it was exactly what beer should smell like. I am only slightly hesitant from giving it a 5.0 score. It is a confident smell of quality ingredients.  Taste - Clear orange/citrus smell. Delicious.  Mouthfeel - Altogether, this beer has character. I can't do it justice, just offer my advice to try this one.  Drinkability - Went down faster than expected and was amazed at how little the alcohol was effecting me. When that deception's truth caught up to me, I agreed with the name choice.  Quality brew. I like this one a lot.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,MCDuhamel,3.56,"Poured at fridge temperature into a Unibroue branded tulip glass.  A: A pale straw, very clear beer with high carbonation, but with some sediment appearing after the slow pour. I say SLOW pour because that is the only way to pour this beer, which forms an absolutely enormous, white head even with a very gentle pour and even when chilled down. The head actually continues to expand for a few moments after pouring is complete, and then slowly collapses into a large-bubbled foam similar to the cap on an over-frothed latte. Eventually, the head dissipates to a loose bead on the top of the beer. Surprisingly, lacing is only moderate. A beautiful beer to look at.  S: Aroma of noble hops, some spicy phenolic notes, and yeast. A very light catty smell.  T: This tastes almost like an ""imperial"" Pilsner and less like a Belgian strong golden. Crisp, clean malt supported by continental style hops. Some lemon, citrus flavors in the middle of the toungue. There is a spicy note that gives it some ""Belgian ale"" quality. Again, a very slight catty note that I sometimes detect in Pilsners. There is a slightly astringent quality to the finish.  M: Light, almost spritzy mouthfeel.  D: Quaffable, despite its high alcohol content.  Overall: I find this a little too much like a lager and less like an ale for my taste. It is well executed, but not as complex as I would expect a Belgian ale to be. A quite good beer, to be sure, and one I will certainly drink again, but shy of outstanding.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,matsputis,3.48,"Pours a very pale straw color, the foamy head leaves large bubble lacing on the sides (it seems decorative) and a rocky island in the middle.  The smell is primarily bubblegum and light fruity flavors.  The taste flashes across the tongue. It's very clean, no alcohol presence. I picked up some apricot in the finish.  For mouthfeel, the only thing I could think of was the carbonation. Wayyy too carbonated for my tastes - almost like drinking foam. It's probably what makes the flavor dissipate so fast.  It's definitely unique, but I'll rather spend my money on any other Belgian because of the carbonation. The taste and smell are solid though... the price hurts.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

I poured this beer into a chalice of no speciality and half the damn thing was thick white cream. My face was in this beer before I could even reach the actual liquid through the head! Gotta love that, and on the two other pours the head stayed, even after sitting in the sun for a good 10 minutes. Thats damn good. The smell is like a hefe suprisingly, a little acidic though. The taste is like a hefe with balls, or like the Chimay White, but a little toned down. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but hey, its a pale beer, what do you want? The drinkability takes a huge hit after the first chalice-full, it just brings the alcohol out a little too heavily for how light the beer seems, so it plays tricks on you.

Toward the end of the pouring, the beer didn't even make it beyond the head- it hit the foam and just created more. Beautiful dark golden color, the head dissipates slowly, and leaves lacing all down the glass. Beautiful.  S: Fairly aromatic, similar to a citrus wheat almost, with citrus notes, some yeast, and malts.  T: Great taste, comprising elements of lemon and orange citrus, banana, and malt.  M: Warming, somewhat light, mildly carbonated (a lot of it was dissipated in the head).  D: If I could, I'd drink it much more often. A glorious brew, with a slightly high ABV.

Perfection. Head was taller than the beer itself (poured in a cognac glass remember), pure white. The beer was bronze-ish golden. Lots and lots of carbonation. Looks like a dark champagne.  Aroma: Yeast, a little alcohol, but not much. Smells refreshing and light.  Taste: Hell yes. Theres a lot going on in here. Im getting lots of hefe flavors like banana. Also some sour pilsner type tastes. More alcohol than I like, even more than youd expect at 8.5%. The funny thing is, even with all that going on, it still seems refreshing and light. The mouthfeel is a lot like champagne with the huge amount of bubbles.  Notes: I had to drive 80 miles one way to get this one, and paid about $12 for four of them. This is $3 I was happy to spend.

Pale straw to light gold coloring with a heavy, steady stream of carbonation up the center. Very clear (looks like a nice pilsner). Tons of Belgian lace through the snifter  Im convinced this beer coined the ubiquitous phrase. S: Lots of sweet/fruity and grainy malt coming through the nose  hint of some pilsner malts somewhere in there. T: Fruity in the front followed by a nice spicy, pepper bitterness. Very good balance here. The label says 8.5% ABV but I cant tell at all. I can also taste some of the dry grain, similar to that of a pilsner. Extremely dry in the finish with a linger alcohol taste. I definitely see where the champagne comparisons come from. M: Fully mouth-coating. Decently carbonated, but very, very fizzy. D: Very drinkable. Refreshing (uncommon for so much alcohol).

222,695,MiguelMandingo,4.18,"This is my third beer review. I havent had many Belgian Strong Pale Ales before, but this is a tasty beer.  Poured a 11.2 oz bottle into my Duvel tulip glass.  Appearance  Clear golden color. Incredible head retention  2 to 3 fingers of pure white bubbles. Lots of lacing.  Smell  Citrus malt and yeast. A second whiff brings out a flowery aroma and some kind of spice that I cant put my finger on.  Taste  A very complex sweet citrus. Extremely crisp. I don't really taste the hops as much in this beer as I have in many others.  Mouthfeel  Light bodied. Lots of carbonation  almost like champagne. Has a very dry finish that makes you want to have another sip.  Drinkability  Very drinkable. Hardly notice that it is 8.5 ABV. It is funny how the best beers hide the alcohol so well.  It is truly amazing how delicious this beer is, while at the same time it could be mistaken for a macro when just looking at it. I don't know how they pack so much flavor into such a clear effervescent beer. It is kind of deceptive, but in that good way. Of the Belgian Strong Pale Ales the only other ones I have tasted are the Delirium Tremens, and La Fin Du Monde, and I much prefer Duvel to either of those.

222,695,MrMcGibblets,4.25,"poured a beatiful gold with an awesome rocky head into a duvel glass. lacing? how can there be lacing when the head doesn't move? the bouqet on this is exceptionally complex. some things that i can detect/remember are: bread, honey, dough, floral notes, apricots, yeast, and much more...i was annoying the gf due to constantly smelling this beer. taste was of the above, like drinking a wonderful liquid bread mixed with honey, flowers, and light stone fruits balanced beautifully by the subtle yet present on the tongue hops. finish is not overpowering but long. medium/full bodied, mouthfeel is spritzy, quite carbonated but not fake carbonated like a macro, drinkability is great for a beer of this body and abv but i know i can't have too many or i will be drooling on myself again by the end of the night like the last time i had the devil.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Bitterbill,4.6,"Pours from 11.2oz bottle(room temp) a clear light gold with a huge billowy head of foam that hardly shrinks at all and has lots of lovely lacing.  The smell is very floral with strong notes of yeast and hops. Very nice..  The taste has a nice sour-bitterness(lemon?) up front with a lot of malty tones in the background and a heaping helping of yeastiness that is very complex and tasty. At 8.5%abv, there's some warming as it goes down but it doesn't show up too much in the taste at all. Very very nice indeed. The sourish finish is also very flavourful and lingering and that demands my taking another sip...great stuff!  I'm just pouring the last bit into my glass and I'm getting some sediment making for a more cloudy appearance and wow...the malt just kicked it up a few notches and some apple and clove. So many flavours come out of this brew during various times in the session. You just *can't* lose interest...it refuses to let you. ;^)  Bottom line: This is a very tasty Golden Ale that I've enjoyed every time I've had it. Highly recommended!!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,schusterbauer,4.78,"crisp yellow with a picturesque head that rises and falls at will. what should beer look like? this. aromas of sweet and spicy malts and notable yeast, only hinting at traditional belgian odors. champagne in the mouth -- crisp carbonation and a dry finish. drink quickly and enjoy the carefree nature of the beer, or sip slowly and discover the hints of fruitiness, floral elements, and spices. drinkable, addictive, and never hints at its abv (until it hits your constitution, of course).",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Yotus,4.53,"Poured into a chilled tulip glass. Massive, white head with copious release of CO2. Hieroglyphic-like Belgian lace - almost indicates the date and time I took a sip!  Crystal clear, golden - more depth of color than a standard Euro Pilsener-type beer.  Unique yeasty aromatics, no spicy phenols of the type usually associated with a lot of other Belgian ales - much cleaner, but still complex with some earthy undertones. Almost wine-like in its dryness.  Solid Pilsen-type malt backbone, but with a very light body. Very crisp with a Saaz-type hop character. Dry finish makes this a very dangerous beer to drink, as the alcohol character is subdued.  A very unique beer, very drinkable and one of the driest beers I've ever tasted.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Jcdolan,4.1,"A pint for $8.95 was purchased for me in Massachusetts on my birthday (a little pricey if you ask me). Nice looking offering, corked, with and an interesting write up about the brewery and how to serve the beverage was printed on the bottle. Poured into a glass it was yellow with noticable hazeyness. Poured like it was champaigne, with tons of bubles and a rediculously thick white head that stayed on the glass and looked like a solid substance when I was done. I could tell this was going to be a good beer. The smell was fruity/citrus with alcohol. MINOR hints of hops broke through at times. Taste was very complex with alcohol taking over at the end. Almost too complex of a taste to describe. Very pleasing however. Tingley mouthfeel that smooths out and goes down easy. This drink is very strong but very enjoyable. Clearly a well brewed beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,rkuhnel,4.48,"From the Northcoast Coop here in Eureka, CA this set me back a full $7.99. Serious money, but then this is a serious beer. Poured into my Duvel glass it was a slightly cloudy golden color with a gigantic head that looks like a mushroom shaped cloud. The head lasted a long time and left big chunks of lacing in the glass. Aroma is cloves spices with a lot of coriander, floral hops, and yeast. Mouthfeel is rich and greasy. Simply wonderful. Flavor is yeasty, with some floral notes. Nice dry finish and good to the very last drop. A really nice brew",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,MrHungryMonkey,4.26,"11.2 oz funky little bottle. Served 40-45 degrees in a sniffer.  Pours a pale yellow slight haze. Amazing head, almost looks like meringue  foamy, creamy, and soft. It lasts for a long while and leaves thick lacing. Ample carbonation. Cant say no to these looks.  Sweet malt, sugary and light toasty biscuit/nut. Hops balance well: floral and spicy, interesting sharpness pokes out.  Medium bodied and thick. Dry and complex. Twangy hops first, floral and spicy. Deeply sweet malt base, toasty biscuit and mild nut. Sweet and tart fruit character. Distinct yeastiness. Mild warmth, seems to struggle with the alpha acids. Decently bitter. Plenty of carbonation, enough to eat through ones tongue. Finishes tart, bitter, and dry.  As it warms in temperature, it warms accordingly in alcohol - almost astringent flashes pop out every so often. Yeast personality becomes more prominent. Sweeter more-complex malt and bitterness. Deeper we plunge into the rabbit hole.  The infamous Duvel. Strong yet subtle. Almost painfully enjoyable. What can I say? Interesting brew, at least. Not to be taken lightly. Or perhaps best: a force to be reckoned with.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Smells of of sweet honey, fruit juice and malts; almost candy like.  Very crisp and smooth for both mouthfeel and flavor. Almost has a champaign-like quality. Hints of fruit juice and, again, a candy-like malt flavor. Hops are there, but are balanced so well, it is hard to tell where one flavor ends and another begins. Alcohol is masked and balanced extremely well.  I could drink this one all night...not before I lost my senses so I'll keep it to one or two so I could enjoy every second.

Smell: Clean and crisp light malt, faintly sweet, yeasty and bready, not fruity, a little green, grassy, faint alcohol, banana bread.  Taste: A dry sweetness upfront, light and grainy, clean and crisp ,alcohol and hops in the nose, clean, incredibly dry finish. Light lager like malt, zero metallic flavors, light fruity flavors.  Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied, nice and fizzy carbonation, enough to make you want to burp, clean and crisp like a soda, but smoother, not abrasive.  Drinkability: This beer is amazing, always delicious. I'd describe it to myself like an alcoholic lager with more flavor, with hefeweizen banana bread flavor, but cleaner and lighter than both.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,theformula,4.48,"A: Gorgeous, angelic golden body that strangely lager-like, with the most massive, foamy white head...wow. Very sticky lacing with everlasting retention. Near perfect.  S: Soft hops, yeast and sweet malts lend a complex aroma, but foremost citrusy hops and yeast. Some nice bubble gum and fruit esters going on as well. An herbal/floral aroma is present.  M: Medium body with a puch of carbonation, giving it a pretty full and crisp mouthfeel.  T: Not much to complain about. This is complex. There's beautifully bitter (a little piney and citrusy) hops, Belgium candy sugar, and honey-sweet malts. The mid-section shows off the candy sugar with bubble gum, along with a balancing yeast bite and mineral notes. Finishes with a very subtle alcahol spice and a dry, champagne-dry finish.  D: Even on my second taste, it's still king of its kind. Complex, crisp, big and drinkable. The 8.5% ABV is so very well hidden. Why is it called ""Devil"" when it's nearly god-like in perfection?",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Atch,3.91,"Poured from a 333 ml bottle into a large goblet  Appearance: cloudy golden color, weiss like. Nice carbonation and an icredible meringue like head. I poured it so carefully and my first bottle is more than half head which goes down eventually, but remains throughout the glass. Insane lacing as well.  Smell: I get a slight citrus, maybe pear also.  Taste: Call me crazy, but I almost taste a hint of banana and the pear I smelled. Being 8.5 abv I would never guess. For me the alcohol is almost undetectable.  Mouthfeel: The beer feels wonderful on the palate. It has a medium but very smooth feel. I like the carbonation lasting the whole glass.  Drinkability: I would Definitely have Duvel again.  Comments: Mostly sticking to American pale ales, this was different for me. And I loved every minute of it. I wish I would have tried this beer years ago. I know for most people this is a pretty mainstream beer, but if you haven't tried it or are looking for a change... This one won me over.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

MASSIVE 3+ finger foamy white pillowtop head, takes forever to diminish. You need a goblet for this bad boy.  S: Smells deliciously sweet, not too cloying, and reminds me of ripe fruit, namely bananas, pears and even apples. Nice!  T: A very complex brew, at the right temperature it almost tastes like a high-quality sake, specifically a pear-flavored one. An immensely tangy bite beyond the initial fruity burst, and a bit hot on the finish. Very enjoyable though.  M: As is the case with so many Belgians, this beer is incredibly carbonated; drink it too quickly and you'll be burping like a newborn. Still nice & creamy though.  D: Pretty easy to drink given the high ABV, though 1 bomber is more than enough in a sitting. I'd definitely go back to Duvel again.  Recommended.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,udubdawg,4.25,"squat 11.2 oz bottle.  poured and drank two of these in quick succession. On the first I didn't see the pale tendrils of yeast escaping the bottle until it was too late. Still it was fascinating to watch as it slowly dispersed throughout the beer. It created a whiteness that made the already pale golden beer seem even paler. On the second I watched more carefully, and was able to keep the yeast in the bottle to be enjoyed later by itself.  It occurred to me that unless someone shoved a bottle of BMC-style lager in my hand last summer at a BBQ, I haven't had something this pale in a very long time. There is no mistaking this for macro-crap-lager though. The head was big and frothy and slightly off-white despite the careful pour. Perfect the 2nd time around when I was even more careful. Head retention is terrific, and lacing is in huge clumps all over the glass.  Nose is very clean and fresh - lemon, and some other fruit I'm not sure of - Pear? Aspects of the smell are redolent of some wheat beers. Definitely a bit of alcohol noted along with an undefined spiciness. Intriguing.  Taste is very nice. Refreshing to say the least. Rather sweet, but with a nice dash of sourness and some bitter. Alcohol is noted but not overwhelming. Yeasty and a great drying crispness as it finishes.  Mouthfeel is great - everything about this beer is crisp and clean. Carbonation on the high side of medium, but it does not detract from the... Drinkablity? I'm opening my 3rd, and better finish typing this while I still can. Can't believe I missed this beer until now. At 8.5% it'll knock ya on your butt, so watch it. I think it was $8.99 for a 4-pack, and if that is correct it was worth every penny.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,MMansfield,3.78,"Bought a single at the NSLC.  Appearance: Pours a very hazy peachy orange/yellow colour in an over sized wine glass. Huge fluffy, bone white head with amazing retention.  Aroma: Rich malts with tons of spicyness and loads of citrus. Quite a complex aroma, a little too complex for this intermediate nose.  Taste: Very complex flavours here. Managed to pick up on caramel. candied fruit, maybe some coriander. Yeasty and smokey, hard to get a handle on the taste.  Mouthfeel: Lots of body, a delight with a very warm alcohol finish.  Final Statement: Although I respect Belgians a lot, I'm still not a huge fan of them. I see their strong points, and will savour one here and there, but I'm still a die hard English style ale kind of guy. Duvel is the best Belgian I have had though, I highly recommend this one.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,theopholis,4.61,"Appearance- A light golden color that is a tad hazy (Probably due to the bottle-conditioning and my sloppy pour). Has an epic, thick, white head that has some decent staying power and leaves behind a white, frothy lacing.  Aroma- Cool mix of both sour and sweetness. Never smelled anything quite like it. Has some light, indescernable fruits and a hint of citrus. The aroma is very tantalizing.  Taste- Very complex. There's a lot going on with this beer. Has stong fruity tones that start out like the aroma, but then get puckerish. Almost no hops (either bittering or flavoring). Just enough to keep this drinking like a beer. Also get some fresh-baked bread in there.  Mouthfeel- Pretty light body, with lots of carbonation. I'd say it's over-carbonated, but the high CO2 level brings out the sweet-sour complexities very nicely, and really get the beer dancing over your toungue.  Drinkability- Very drinkable.

Light fruits and spice come through in aroma - specifically, pear, banana and peppers are most noticable. It's a floral, yeasty, fruity champagne - which while not sounding all that attractive, turns out bloody brilliant.  Lighter fruits and alcohol shine in the aftertaste, but are overshadowed by the immediate upfront taste of clove, spice and sweet malts. It feels creamy and exotic and goes down almost too well.  Despite the alcohol content and its high carbonation, it's extremely drinkable, although in my opinion La Chouffe is more so.

Deceptively pale, explosive carbonation in every part of the glass; not just the middle or up the sides, everywhere. Three-finger head after a perfect pour that is stiff on top and rocky. Bright white in color. Smells kinda like a tripel with light spicy hops and winey, light fruity smells. Also somewhat phenolic. Taste the crisp and light spicy hop profile and the sweeter pale malts. Lighter mouthfeel and extremely bubbly. Slightly drying with a pleasant bitterness. Laces the glass from the highest point of the head all the way down.

222,695,jmalex,4.57,"This one's been sitting in my fridge for a while now, and I figured what better reason to crack it open than, well, for no reason at all!  APPEARANCE: A wonderful golden color that is barely hazy. A huge, rock-solid white head sits on top and shows no signs of going anywhere anytime soon. Let it be known that I should've heeded the warning on the label and poured this much more unhurriedly.  SMELL: First hit is of strong yeast, but some light fruits begin to shine (apricots, peach) as well as a hint of citrus. I took a few extra whiffs of this one, and with each one, I cannot help but think that this is the quintessential aroma of a BSPA.  TASTE: So complex! The fruity tones really shine in the taste and even morph themselves a bit from the smell. Now some darker fruits such as raisins and figs can be tasted. Playing backup is a surprisingly pronounced hop presence as well as a bready yeastiness. The alcohol is nearly undetectable.  MOUTHFEEL: Smooth and easy. Carbonation may be a tad high for my tastes though.  DRINKABILITY: If going by the ""how empty is my glass by the time I get to this section"" test, this one has to rate pretty darn high. And with the 8.5% ABV, look out! Two or more of these (and believe me, I could), and you'll be well on your way to a great night.  So perhaps there was a reason for me to pull this one out of the fridge tonight.

Lacing could be a little better.  Smell - Very lager like, with hints of bannanna. A little bite from the alchohol is present, but understated.  Taste - Very dry with a nice spicyness. Hot alchohol hits the tongue, and fades down the throat. Slightly cloying with the diacetyl crispness of a lager. Although an ale, it seems more lagerish to me. *edit* As it warms some more fruity esters can be found.  Mouthfeel - Thick creamy explosion happens as soon as the beer hits your tongue.

Either way, it tastes great... apples and citrus mostly, alcohol comes throught at the end but not overwhelming. Nice warming of the tummy on this cold winter night.  It's got a great body and perfect amount of carbonation. Leaves a slight hoppy finish.  I don't know if I'd drink more than 2 of these in a sitting, but they're awfully easy to put down, and at the price I found it, it can't be beat.

I admired my pour, then drank... ooof-ah, I spent that much money on skunk beer? wait, lemme sip slower, I'm gulping this stuff. ok, that's better. I don't smell or taste fruit, I smell yeast/wheat and taste a hint of champagne with an alcohol bite then a hint of wheat. bubbles, lots of bubbles, I burped loudly then held one back and let it out of my nose, I got that wheat smell in my nose again. ok, am I ashamed of myself for dropping the money on this beer? no way, overall it ain't bad beer, I like the bottle, the glass, the foam in my nose, and the high abv buzz factor I have right now as I enjoy my 3rd of 4 bottles, I thought it would be good to write the review now as after my 4th, I might ramble on and on and... ooops, my bad! this is a good beer, worth the price and I think anyone who likes Belgian beers should give it a try.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,hseritt,3.83,"Came with a tulip glass. While pouring I found the foam to rise extremely fast causing me to wonder if perhaps I was pouring it wrong. The head actually dissipated quickly and left a very nice lacing. I did notice that when I first poured the beer was very clear-looking especially for a high alcohol one. After pouring though, the color came to a very nice golden color.  The smell was very good. It gave a very good but not overwhelming hoppy smell. The smell revealed something vaguely underneath waiting to show itself.  Very surprisingly the taste waiting to come forth was something similar to a lightly sweet berry taste. Much of the alcohol though held the berry foretaste from coming through completely. There were also hints of other tastes like bananas and orange but very light.  My glass of Duvel really had a nice light feel to it. Not too much but definitely not a flaccid feel.  Honestly, this is probably not a beer I would buy a lot of at a bar (the price at Lassiter's Tavern in Atlanta for this was $7USD a bottle!). I would definitely buy this one occasionally from a good beer store.

The liquid just slightly cloudy with dozens of minature bubbles running up in columns of greatness. Duvel smells like a light crispy beer with hints of orange and sweet malts. It tastes fresh and balanced, but no single ingredient stands out. The 8.5% alcohol content is hidden in the flavor, making it dangerous or awesome depending on the circumstances In my mouth the beer is crisp and light with slightly heavy carbonation, but this does not ruin the drinking experience making for a great beer anytime, anyplace.

222,695,JoeyHotrod,4.73,"One of the best beers in the world and for good reason, Duvel is a treasure to behold.  The appearance is golden, much like that of a pilsner with a massive white fluffy head that reaches the very top of my Duvel tulip. This beer is a joy to look at and pretty close to the equivalent of beer sex. Belgian lace is left throughout and the head lasts the entire duration of the glass. Impressive!  The scent has a slight banana feel, but is dominated by spice more than anything with hints of other fruits coming to the forefront as well.  The taste is heaven in a glass. It's as flavorful as they come, with hints of saez hops and an ever so slight hint of bitterness, all this balanced out by just enough malt.  The drinkability and mouthfeel are both well above average and both are quite suitable for a session beer. When I say session... I mean session... this one simply put goes down with ease and could easily be drank over and over again. (scary given the 8.5 percent abv.... an 8.5 that is virtually nonexistent in the taste.  I'm disappointed in myself for waiting this long to review this gem. I'm a long established sucker for Belgian beers and have been since shortly after discovering better beers and this is truly World Class and every way.

I can't believe I haven't drunk this one much more often. M: Tiny pricky bubbles below medium body, kind of dry. Very good taste, wonderful aroma and altoghether an exceptional beer.

The taste too is extrememly sweet, but with a big kick of peppers and alcohol to follow. The ladder will slap your tongue around, and the vast carbonation numbed my tongue. AHHH!!

222,695,MICAMD,4.53,"The first beer I indulged in with my new Duvel tulip. It just seemed fitting.  A- One of the coolest looking beers I have seen. It is obvious the glass was made for this beer. The ""D"" engraving at the bottom of the tulip really does wonders for the carbonation release and head retention. Beautiful clear golden color. Frothy white head that just doesn't want to go anywhere.  S- Fruit, Belgian spices, a little bit of alcohol. Some of that sourness that comes with the Belgian spices or yeast is apparent as well.  T- Sweetness, a massive amount of complexity. A lot more flavor than one would expect from how clean and clear this beer looks.  M- Very light due to the massive amount of carbonation. The alcohol becomes a bit more warming near the end, but is hidden very well overall.  D- Very good. At first I didn't see what all the fuss was about with this beer, but after having tried it a few times, my eyes have been opened. Well worth the money.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,BBM,3.9,"It pours a lovely golden yellow color with a big, foamy white head that stuck around a long time. The aroma was that of some fruits (bananas), Belgian spices, and a hint of alcohol.  The taste is very well balanced, with fruits and spices up front and a big, warming alcohol finish. It is quite bubbly, and almost champagne-like in texture. Still, it's really a solid beer that is worth your money. Drinkability is a touch lower because of the high alcohol and astringent finish. Otherwise, a very good beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Poured a beautiful cloudy subtle golden with an awesome white, creamy head that didn't diminish. Just an excellent flavor. A well balanced blend of malts and flavors. Exceptional mouthfeel and drinkability, with a super clean finish. I shared the four-pack with my wife and enjoyed watching her response to a relative quality brew. A newfound favorite for both of us.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

I'm ready to amend if need be.  poured (very, very carefully) a gorgeous, unfiltered gold with an explosive head. this beer stands up in any glass, but in its native tulip it is stunning. the aroma is pretty complex-- belgian yeast and an unexpected witlike note with a just a bit of sourness. tastes like it smells (fantastic) and hides the alcohol very well, although you'll realize it's there when you're both hammered and thirsty.  it's full and strong on the palate; alcoholic warmth doesn't come through until well into the bottle.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,AltBock,3.81,"This is my second beer that I'm having in honor of fellow BA and Mexico's Beerfly guide, Pepeton. It was his birthday last week. I first had Stone's Double Bastard for his birthday, but I had to cut out most of his birthday greetings from my review because it was too long. Now I'm going to match his Duvel review.  I got the little 330ml/11.2 oz. crazy looking bottle. It's a very unique bottle. I wouldn't even know what to call the shape of the bottle. It has a big bottom and then goes into 2 humps that connects to the small straight neck of the bottle. Can I call it a Penguin bottle? You have to see the bottle for yourself. If you lived in a beer barn all of your life, then you wouldn't know that Duvel is Flemish for Devil. It just has a plain simple front label with the word ""Duvel"" in big red letters and the Duvel coat of arms above it. No big 12 foot red devil ruling over the 12th level of hell with a pitchfork in hand, just a simple plain white label. The back white label has pouring instructions, information about the beer, US Government warning, and a small black box in the bottom left hand corner that has a best before date and a number that has to meaning to the consumer below that. Mine was best before May 2009.  Appearance: I didn't have the Duvel glass they have pictured on their website or label, so the closest glass I had to that was a Corsendonk Christmas Ale goblet. Worked out just fine. The beer was a hazy golden light lemon yellow or you can say it was a healthy urine yellow. Either way is fine. It had one of the best head of foam that I've seen on a beer. As soon as you pour it, this big fluffy white cloud of foam just rises up so fast that you have to stop pouring half way or it will just overflow the glass. It had excellent retention that left behind 2 tons of white foamy rings and white lace. Sometimes there is more white lace around your glass then beer in your glass. Like the bottle, the head of foam rising up is another thing you need to see for yourself to appreciate from this beer.  Smell: It had an aroma of just cloves, pepper, a hint of yeast, splash of alcohol, and some Belgian fruits in the background. It was more peppery than anything else. Still good, just a bit too peppery.  Taste: It tasted like the Devil himself was dancing on my tongue while wearing his red hot clogs! It really didn't taste like that, but I just had to put it down. It tasted like they really subdued the devil inside this beer. He tried to retaliate at the end, but no problem, they got him a second time. What I'm trying to say is that this beer had strong peppery hops with it's alcohol friend in the beginning, but as soon as it emerged, it was subdued by cloves, yeast, a pinch of toasted malts, and some Belgian fruits. The peppery hops/alcohol tried to come out again, but to no avail. It was already too weak from being conquered by the other flavors.  Mouthfeel: I would have to say that it's in the medium bodied range with an aftertaste of pepper, a smidge of your common bitter hops, and a slight taste of candy sugar in the background.  Drinkability: The back label told me to enjoy this perfection of a beer. Is this beer perfection? Not really. Is it good? Yes! Would I buy it again? Yes, because of the cool funky bottle and to see the massive head of foam just rise up from out of nowhere.  Happy Birthday Pepeton! I Hope you enjoyed my 2 reviews that I had in honor of your birthday! If you're reading this, please send him a birthday beermail. He will appreciate it very much.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,cowace2,4.26,"I call this the most beautiful beer in the world. The way this beer looks in the glass is the way every macro brew beer commerical out there tries to get their beers to look on TV.  Golden color is gorgeous, topped by the legendary enormo-head. I told my wife I had topped it with whipped cream and she believed me.  Smell is good, but not earth shattering. Light fruits and malt. Alcohol is apparent which I don't like.  One of the better tasting golden beers around. I'm a stout man, so I'm always skeptical of beer I can see through. This doesn't disappoint. Wonderful mix of fruits and malts. Bit of alcohol present at the end. Very clean with a delightful aftertaste (how many times does that happen).  Maybe a bit light and fizzy in the mouth for my tastes.   I've been drinking this beer a long time, and I've taken to calling it the ""Budweiser Select"" of Belgian ales. Bold Taste, Clean Finish. Expect Everything.  But for real, in this case.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,joeskirkie,3.81,"I poured unhurriedly as the 11.2 oz. bottle suggests, and was rewarded with a beautiful clear straw colored body topped with a rich foamy white head.  Yeast and malt on the nose, lovely.  Mostly yeast on the tongue as well, with maybe a light sour apple in the background.  Crisp and bubbly, it finishes clean.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,rarevos,4.8,"Poured unhurriedly from bomber into Duvel tulip.  A: Pours a translucent golden-yellow with huge white head. Etching in the bottom of the glass causes carbonation to shoot up the center of the glass in a torrent; the head is consequently higher in the center than at the edges. My wife and I call it ""the Duvel button.""  S: Light grain up front with crisp apple, clove, pepper, and a hint of estery banana.  T/M: Sweet, light malt up front. Nicely estery with some clove, pepper, banana and crisp, dry apple. Finish is lightly bitter with a touch of warming alcohol. Mouthfeel is light, crisp, nicely carbonated. Not overly fizzy for such an active beer in the glass.  D: Insert standard line about high drinkability despite high abv here: ___.

222,695,BeerBelcher,4.56,"This beer is to be admired - widely available and still widely praised. Duvel taught me that beer had texture in addition to taste and aroma, and is a wonderful thing to behold.  This beer pours a pale yellow with secondary fermantation providing plenty of cloud-like head (it towered 1 1/2"" over the rim of my Chimay glass). Smell is slightly sweet and very aromatic. The taste is yeasty, spicy (cloves?), and wonderful. Mouthfeel of this beer is unique; it is so soft and smooth. Duvel is an awesome drinking experience.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

A very careful pour yields a glorious golden ale with a long-lasting, tightly beaded white head that actually keeps growing if you let the glass sit there.  My nose detects pale malt, pear rind, and yeast. Not alcohol.  The taste is crisp and clean. I get fruit (apples, pears) and yeast mostly. Hop bitterness at the end. And warming of alcohol after that. Everything is crisp and clean and dry.

222,695,brdc,4.38,"330 cc bottle from the gift pack. Poured into the Duvel glass that comes in the packet, even slowly as recommended, generates a beautiful, foamy white head that lasts a very long time, eventually leaving a thick lacing. Interestingly, which I had never noticed before, is the ""geyser"" that the previous reviewer mentioned that keeps the carbonation flowing from the middle of the glass. The beer itself is a very nice, golden color, and smells lightly of bananas, clove, alcohol, hops and earth. Taste is very good and well balanced, with some hops, light malt and bananas again with an underlying alcohol warmth. Medium body and very easy to drink for such a high alcohol content.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Kendo,4.33,"A: Poured -- unhurriedly, as the label recommends -- from a 33 cl bottle that said it was best before 06/2009 into the proper Duvel glass. The result? A pale yellow body with a HUGE, 2.5 finger pure white -- I mean PURE white -- head. A geyser of carbonation gushed to the surface from dead-center in the bottom of the glass, fortifying the head with further bubbles. The head sat and sat and sat, diminishing in size only minutely until I started drinking -- at which point sticky, marshmallow-like clumps grabbed the side of the glass. A sight to behold all around.  S: Spicy (peppery) and fruity (green apples?) in the nose, with a hint of clove, but also a musky, almost-skunked scent. Clove smell was more noticeable as it warmed.  T: Nice balance of lemony bitterness, peppery spice and clovey yeast. A citrusy, lemon peel bitterness lingers long after each sip. At times that aftertaste reminds me of some German-style pilsners I've had; it coats the mouth with a semi-dry feeling.  M: Light in body, well-carbonated. The effervescence leaves it generally dry and clean, but at times I find the carbonation leaves it a little too fizzy for my taste.  D: Excellent. Very drinkable all around, especially for a beer of this strength, alcohol-wise.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Here is where it went down hill. Sweet malt taste, but suprisingly uncomplex. I drank it at 55 degrees and even as it warmed it seemed very two dimentional. Drinks pretty easy, but was too sweet for my taste.

222,695,BoozySmurf,4.3,"Thanks to Jessica & Toni for the gift pack. Merry Christmas to me. I poured a chilled bottle into my duvel chalice unhurriedly as instructed, but this baby was a foaming beast. The meringue-like head, eventually, settled and after two pours the bottle was empty. Clumps of foam stuck to the glass as the head rescinded into the golden liquid. Appearance was slightly hazy from the yeast, and very effervescent. I guess that's why the bottle made an audible ""pop"" when I opened it. Aroma was malty, sugary sweet with peppery hop notes and lightly phenolic. Taste was on the sweet side as well, but there was enough bitterness for balance. Malty, yeasty, and the alcohol was barely noticeable. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied and amply bosomed, er I mean carbonated. Drinkability was very good. I had two bottles to toast the new year in style.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,FtownThrowDown,3.69,"Appropriately poured into my Duvel chalice. First off, without taking my first drink, visually this is the best looking beer I've ever poured! Half the glass is huge, frothy, rocky head. The bottle pours perfectly into the glass, no room to spare. The carbonation being released from the inscribe ""D"" on the bottom of the glass leaves a steady stream of beautiful bubbles constantly rising to the top of the beer. Nice! Smell is yeasty with some alcohol and lemony zest. The mouthfeel is really smooth considering the carbonation that is prevalent. This is a really easy drinking, enjoyable beer. This is a very sessionable beer due to the taste and smoothnesss, but be careful it packs a punch and after a few of these you'll definitely be feeling it. This has been a very pleasant surprise and something I'll revisit quite often.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Gmann,4.41,"Poured out of a 750 ml caged and corked bottle. The color was a hazy straw color with an insane white puffy head that left fantastic lacing as it dissipated. The smell is juicy, a bit sweet. However the taste is not overly sweet. There is a bit of a sweet maltiness to it, a bit of champagne, then it end dry with a little twang of bitterness. The mouthfeel is full bodied with fizzy carbonation. This beer has great balance and is scarily drinkable. Has always been a favorite of mine since I first tried it.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,bluejacket74,4.03,"Served in a snifter, the beer pours a clear golden color with a large puffy white head. Head retention and lacing are both excellent. It smells like yeast and spices, and also like pears. It tastes the same way to me, but with more sweetness, spicyness and fruityness to the taste. The mouthfeel is light/medium, with a lot of carbonation, almost too much. Drinkability is good, but not great because of the very high carbonation.

222,695,kenito799,4.8,"750 ml bottle ""good until 2/2009"" poured into a Duvel glass  I figured it is time I review this beer since it was my introduction to the art of Belgian beer craft. Since I first tried it I have tasted many more Belgians (with many more to go)....  Gorgeous yellow-golden color, clear (bottle stored upright, yeast only came out in the last pour); giant actively rising massive foamy white head, recedes slowly leaving big chunks up and down the glass, with a perfect coat of lace.  Aroma is beguiling; there is fruitiness, citrus, pilsener maltiness...super-active carbonation foams in the mouth early after the pour, later calms down some.  The flavor carries through with a dancing array of complex, transforming flavors...refreshing like a pilsener, yet ale-like fruity sweetness and pleasing bitterness dance across the tongue. Every sip brings something new; no aspect of the character dominates, the pilsener/Belgian ale kaleidoscope of flavors makes this both a refreshing, delicious beer and one that can be contemplated.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

This is kind of the gold standard when it comes to appearance. A rocky, yet fluffy white head with fine white bubbles and lacing that never stops. Aroma of belgian farmhouse funk and sweet malt and light candi sugar. The taste expands on the aroma with a mellow bitterness over candi sugar and light malts. Very drinkable.

Taste mimics the aroma. There is more alcohol present in the taste than the smell lets on. The remaining head gives some creaminess to the mouthfeel.  Despite owning large snifters, I am glad I bought the gift pack with the Duvel snifter.

First thing I noticed was the pure clarity of this brew. It's amazing. My pour was a little bit under par but it had a huge white head. It was thick and shapeful. Lacing all the way down the snifter. Carbonation is astounding a constant line of bubbles from the base of the snifter. Fruity aroma. Taste of alcohol and mild hop combination.  One of the best brews I've had. The paleness is deceiving.

Spice in the back of the mouth and throat. Long finish - dry, spicy, yeasty, somewhat astringent.  Great mouthfeel - astringent, spicy, finely carbonated. But it can get a bit too fizzy at times.

I can't believe I haven't tried this yet.  Poured into my Duvel tulip glass (thanks, AKSP). Splendid, bubbly bright golden yellow in color. BOISTEROUS head threatens to overrun the glass. Thick and long-lasting white lace. Aromas are a myriad of spices, estery fruit, maybe a dash of alcohol. Flavors are intense. A rush of spices at first, with the middle seeing lots of fruity and ""wheaty"" influence. Warming ABV near the end with a long-lasting spicy/hoppy finish. It got better and more complex as it warmed closer to room temperature.  Slick mouthfeel and dangerously drinkable.

Fruity, complex, just the right amount of bitterness, a sweetness that isn't cloying. And while a strong beer, you won't notice the alcohol until it is far too late. It sneaks up on you, and then pounces.  Think of this as some sort of liquid feline, and you, dear reader, are the rodent...  My only real gripe with this beer was the amount of carbonation.  I suppose it is possible that it should be like this, but for me, it felt TOO carbonated.

The nose brought out aromas of peaches, citrus and sweet malts with a subtle scent of hops and alcohol.  Initial taste is an evanescent hoppy bitterness that transitions quickly into a malty, fruity finish accompanied by a strong, warming taste of alcohol. Very nice overall, but didn't have the richness and complexity I anticipated.  Beer brings a crisp, highly carbonated mouthfeel.  Overall, a good beer and very drinkable for its style. It seems like a good sipping beer -- nice to unwind with at the end of a long worknight. I will say, however, that it wasn't as good as I expected. I actually found the lower-rated (on here at least) and less expensive Don de Dieu from Unibroue to be much more enjoyable.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,bgraney,3.98,"Just like the label say's, it's golden. A little bit hazy with a spectacular head; fluffy white filled with moon craters with an almost marshmallow like consistency. Aroma was on the spicy-citrusy side but the first thing I thought of was green apples. Smooth, well balanced flavor, mellow citrusy expansion but confined to the tongue area. Not much flavor left once the alcohol burns off. A little thin in the mouthfeel I thought. It seemed to fade fast. Very drinkable for a strong ale. Flavors are laid back, allowing for a full night of sipping.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

With a citrus, fruity, yeasty aromas. Flavors of Citrus, tartness, hops, yeast. Mouth feel is light bodied, with high carbonation. Gaseous feeling. A beer to try, with very little complexity, yet is not overwhelmed by alcohol. It is a decent interpretation worth a try. After warming up and carbonation dies down more of a flavor and aroma.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,Damian,3.83,"Drank from an 11.2 fl. oz. bottle purchased at Julio's Liquors, Westboro, MA  Poured a somewhat hazy, light straw with a huge, five-finger bubbly head. The resulting chunks of froth eventually faded to a dollop of foam in the middle of the glass, which lasted for most of the drink. Tons of bubbly, sticking lacing throughout.  Smell was of smooth Saaz hops. Grassy and hay-like notes were apparent. Clean and fresh like the countryside. Some alcohol noticeable as well. The aromas became gradually more intense as the beer warmed.  Taste was hoppy as well (Saaz hops), with an astringent alcohol bite. Some alcohol warming throughout the entire mouth. Peppery notes were detectable along with a slight grainyness. Crisp, clean, snappy hop finish, but not as dry as expected.  Mouthfeel was medium-light. Carbonation was somewhat heavy and tickled the tongue.  This is a nice beer to pair with fish. It is fairly easy drinking regardless of the fact that the alcohol can become a bit overwhelming.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,RustythePelican,4.04,"This is a fine beer, and pairs well with a variety of foods. Pay heed to the 8.50% ABV, however - it really sneaks up on you.  Appearance: Poured into a Duvel glass; even with a light pour, 50% of the glass was filled with a dense head. Color was surprisingly light. I'm always impressed with the ""fountain effect"" of bubbles making their way from the bottom of the tulip glass to the head.  Smell: Not particularly noticeable, particularly for a Belgian ale.  Taste: Perhaps a little mild for a Belgian ale. Sweet, tongue-coating malts predominate, with a very faint hop taste on the finish. Absolutely no aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Dense carbonation makes this beer ""thick"" without being heavy.  Drinkability: Fabulous. Take time to enjoy a Duvel. A great beer for introducing someone to the beers of Belgium.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,barefootbrewer,3.74,"This beer poured a clear light yellow with a thick creamy head. It is highly carbonated and you can see the carbonation bubbles streaming up from the bottom of the glass (this beer was poured in a Duvel glass and the bubbles emanated from the bottom center of the glass). It has very nice lacing. It has a sour/sweet smell. The taste is hoppy and cereal, with a bit of sourness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a heavy dose of noticeable carbonation which is brite in the mouth.

Thick white foam, looks like meringue. Very light golden color, with continuous bubbles rising to the top, looks almost like champagne. Very nice fruity, yeasty smell. Nice light, dry taste. I mainly taste some apple flavor and yeast. Even at 8.5% ABV, I'm not tasting any alcohol. So, be careful. This is very good, a wonderful sipping beer. I think we can move Miller High-Life's title over to this as the true ""Champagne of Beers."" I think this beer is too good that I'll have to limit it to special occasions.

The smell is of belgian yeastyness, slight pepper and fruity. The Saaz hops come through too. The first sip gave me a huge wheat impression. Some lemon zest shows along with some alcohol. As it warms the malt flavors come though more distinctly along with some earthy tones. Very lively highly carbonated mouthfeel. Dry finish. Overall, this one didn't dissapoint. A beer that is worth the hype it gets.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Smells fantastic  T - very subtle alcohol kick in the finish that is also very sweet, no dry hoppiness to be found here, very smooth indeed. Lemon zesty is less apparent, but sweet malts are definitely there are the start, at times this tastes like a hefe weizen on steroids  M - A previous reviewer was right - it is slightly too carbonated at the pour, but as it warms through the glass, it becomes wonderfully subtle, a nice gentle spritzy feeling. Very clean on the palate for a strong ale.  D - not one for a session, but as a sipper its great, wouldnt want more than 1 in a night, a belgian to savour!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

The star of the show is the sniff, which is as Belgian as you're gonna get, and contains some Yuletide elements like nutmeg & cinnamon. The taste is similar, but with more bitterness than I expected. The mouthfeel is rich at first, thins out, and ends dry as hell.  In closing, I have no idea why in the hell it took me so long to try this legend of a brew, but it will be followed by many, many more.

222,695,monkaass,4.13,I tried this beer for the first time and I was pleasantly suprised with the incredible mouth feel and wonderful smoothness even before enjoying the first swallow of this fine Belgium ale.  I noticed a high carbonated bite that made me wince slighty but not enough to quel the fine complexity and taste of this beer.  This beer is most enjoyed when you have the opportunity to slow down which is required right off the bat when you are forced to slowly pour this brew. I feel that this is the type of beer that can put a huge smile on your face when your mood calls for a Belguim.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,surcorx,4.51,"This is without question a beer like few others. It would not matter even if you didn't enjoy its taste--though I could hardly imagine such a thing. To simply view it in Duvel glassware is enough to realize you are experiencing something special. The foam is not merely substantial, but astonishing. Pure, snowy, creamy soft white foam that does not quit! It is beautiful to behold. The bottle itself reminds you to pour unhurriedly. It doesn't matter, because no matter what you do this thing is going to rise.  How does it taste? Very good. Extremely good. It is hard to describe. There are no overwhelming characteristics outside of the head. It is well carbonated, and pleasantly drinkable. At the same time, it is ever so slightly sweet yet an assertive bitterness just sneaks in and then quickly dissipates. It is strongly reminiscent in appearance and somewhat taste to a filtered hefeweizen. Yet, it's taste is much more assertive, spicy and mildly bitter. It is clean and refreshing, yet more complex and sophisticated and could easily be served with nearly any cuisine. The name Duvel is Flemish and means devil and the devil is certainly in the details of this beer.  This is an excellent beer. Highly potent, but drinkable nevertheless. It will sneak up on you. Enjoy.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

The nose is full of estery goodness, banana and lemon, and a touch of pale malt.  The flavor is strongly citrusy; lemon grass and orange peel, mild malty sweetness, and a lightly hopped finish. Extremely dry in the finish.  The mouth is heavier than I was expecting from such a pale beer, but then it does have 8.5% alcohol. However, it's not nearly as filling as, say, Rochefort 10.

Clear lager-like golden beneath topped with the most gigantic white head that fills the rest of the glass. Lasts forever, leaving clumps of foam on the glass during drinking. I could sit and smell this all day,although describing aromas of banana and Juicy Fruit doesn't quite convey it. Explosive flavour on tasting with a lingering length.

Like Faust, I'm conjuring the Duvel...here goes nothin'.  This one has a giant 4 finger head that just keeps rising like a monster from the depths. Lots of tiny bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass like champagne, and the big bubbles in the head look like a honeycomb. Lots of small wet spots of lacing coat the glass.  Smells like wet barnyard hay. Grassy, lemon rinds, dry pine forest needles, dried flowers, and a touch of alcohol. Also, hints of sweet honey.  Tastes strongly pastoral. Farmyard hay, dusty yeast, lemon grass, and spicey hops. There is alot going on here. It's almost assaulting to the taste buds at first, but also very nice once I became aquainted with the assertive and unapologetically bizzare flavor. Sweet in the middle with a dry and dusty finish with loads of alcohol.  Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with lots of tingly carbonation and a very dry finish that lasts quite a while. Decently drinkable, but the high alcohol content and uniquely dry flavor could prevent me from drinking more than one or two.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Head is snow white, and towers tall. Rocky and pitting, is the head.. Lacing is extravagant. Final pour clouds the body a bit.  Aroma is unique. Saaz hops, lilacs, wet flower blossoms, earthy yeast, and notes of white grapes and Anjou pears.  Mouthfeel is pleasant enough, with a light medium body and a velvety and assertive carbonation.  Taste is complex and interesting, with fruit notes of green apples, kiwi, and white grapes layering upon an earthy yeastiness, accented by a clean and dry Saaz hoppiness. White grapes and bitter Bohemian hops serve up a clean and crisp finish.  I'm really blessed by revisiting this one. This is a Belgian Blonde Ale as the gods intended.

Very citrusy scent with some sweet malts coming through. The taste, oh my what a taste! The taste is lightly sweet and mostly of the malts but with some slight hops kicking through the end. Hints of yeast are there as well. The mouthfeel is quite outstanding with a lively carbonation that feels great on the tongue.  Highly drinkable beer. It exudes great aromas and flavors.

M - Crisp. Perfect for the flavor.  D - This went very well with my fish and though I like much hoppier beers, this a perfect beer to eat with.

222,695,uberabr,4.94,"A: Poured from a unique 12 oz into a tulip. This is the lightest beer Ive had in a while. On the murky side and yellow, lemonade colored, with some golden hues. Nice light, white, fluffy head and good carbonation.  S: A very sweet maltyness. No real hops. You can feel them in the nose but they really just expand on the light, fruity malted quality. Well played! Lemon peel and limes with a dash of mint followed by a delicate balance of grassy and buttery notes with a hint of black pepper. Very complex and understated. I havent even tasted this beast yet, I could really just keep on smelling it (but I wont!).  T: Very sweet, but not sugary sweet, more of a caramel-honey. Light and buttery. The malt character comes through mostly in the aftertaste. Theres a hint of lemon citrus but not the obnoxiously heavy malt-liquor twang that is all too common in high AbV citrusy ales. Speaking of ABV, wheres the alcohol?  M: Light and full. Crisp, clean, and perfectly carbonated.  D: This is one of the most drinkable Belgian ales Ive ever had. I wish I had bought the big bottle. I don't like giving so many 5's but I just can't think of anything I'de really improve. I guess you just can't beat 140 years of craftsmanship!

Rich hazy golden color. One fine looking beer.  Rich nose with banana and nilla wafers. Hoppy profile with a rich sweet malt body and gentle but busy carbonation. Richness and hoppiness are well balanced. Alcohol is tastefully presented, and easy to palate. Slightly warming. Is this the predecessor to American Double Pilsners?

It's a nice light yellow color, slightly hazy, with a big fluffy white head of foam. There is lacing all the way down the glass. Carbonation appears medium.  Aroma is lemon citrusy/yeasty, very clean and inviting. A little bubble gum in the background adds to the complexity. Maybe a hint of alcohol and noble hops as it warms.  First sip is on the sweet side, but it's quickly overtaken by lemon citrus. Very refreshing and clean, with a yeasty bite. Hop bitterness is fairly low, and hop flavor very low. Very well balanced beer. There is a sweetness there, but it's still a crisp beer. Aftertaste is citrusy and yeasty, very pleasant.  Mouthfeel is medium, with a fairly active level of carbonation, which zings across my tongue. The beer is crisp and clean, but my lips are slightly sticky from sweetness. Cool! Warmth comes through at the very end.  This would be a great beer to introduce neophytes to Belgian beers. It's definitely Belgian, but not overwhelming in any way. Its very well made, well balanced and crisp, with enough ABV to please anyone. It also has a nice ""yeastiness"" which is typical to many Belgian beers.

Sharp bittersweet taste with pear and apple-like flavors. Some alcohol mixed with light phenolic flavors.  High carbonation and light-medium body. Crisp and dry finish, very refreshing. The 8%ABV is hidden nicely.  Duvel means Devil. Only gets smoother as it warms. This is an extremely delightful beer. Definitely top of the beer food chain.

I didn't think too much of this brew before and I'm thinking I might have drank it too cold and in the wrong glass (Straight out of the fridge and in a Pilsener glass) This time I let it sit a while, and drinking out of an oversized wine glass.  I poured this one nice and slowly as I remember the crazy head this gave off last time I tried it, It poured a translucent yellow with a head that remains on top ever so slightly. The smell had some banana clove notes almost like a Hefe Weizen, but at the same time had the signature smells of a belgian ale (that nice fruity aroma that I can't quite describe, but almost all belgians except lambics have it).  At first taste, it tasted as i remember, but as it warmed slightly, the flavor became quite enjoyable. Sweet banana clove and a very delicate aroma of prunes made its way through the palate, coming to an exceptionally clean finish. For a 8.5% ABV this is remarkably smooth and quite easy to drink.  Much better than I remembered it to be. I'll be sure to keep a bunch of these in the fridge over the winter, it warms you up nicely.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Smell: Fresh apples; tart and musty yeast; spicy alcohol; light, sweet malts; and piquant, herbal hops. It smells nice but it doesn't have the depth that I expect from the style.  Taste: Brilliantly spicy from a chord of alcohol, hops, and yeast. Light and mellow at first, then piquant and zesty as you swallow and bittersweet in the finish. Fruity, vinous, bitter, earthy, and paradoxically bold yet light.  Mouthfeel: Airy, soft, chewable, and sticky. Slightly syrupy.

Belgian Pale Ales have since become one of my favorite styles.  Appearance  Pours a hazy yellowish-orange. The head is massive and frothy. I had to wait several minutes for head reduction and even then with substantial lacing.  Smell  Lemon scents, yeast, perhaps a bit of grass. Pleasant overall but not overtly noticeable.  Taste  An excellent ale. You are hit at once by strong hints of spice and citrus that reappear more subtly as you progress. Some hop bitterness is noticeable but I really couldn't taste the alcohol until I had nearly finished the second bottle.  Drinkability Perhaps a bit too drinkable for an ABV of 8.5%.

A totally enjoyable experience.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,pjwilson,4.53,"appearance: pours into a wine glass with massive carbination, yet the heads fades quickly enough, which works out ok. The beer is a very light yellow color, with some haze. The carbination continues throughout the glass.  smell: yeah i should probably get a Duvel glass, yet I'm not at home anyways. Still the smell is pretty mild by any standard. I do get hints of pears, and bit of that crisp bone dryness. Just kinda weak to merit a higher score.  taste: now that's a beer. The crisp dryness is the key here, with flavors of peaches and pears added by the yeast, but in a restrained amount. Tasting about as dry as a beer can get, I'm tasting the bitterness of the hops, and it seems almost like there is pepper in here.(I have no idea if there is or not)  mouthfeel: So light, so smooth, so great. Really typifies how a Belgian Strong Pale beer should be, deseptive. Hence Duvel.  drinkability: yeah, this one goes down good, really a fantatic drinker that sort of demands quick drinking. Yes you savor it, but it's pretty hard to go slow on it. This beer is worthy of the respect it gets. A must try, and a must re-buy.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

I smell corny but I think a lot of people would get pissy at me but hey fuckem. I smell a spicy coors light, and I swirled and warmed the beer to no end.  T: Meh. I think I just dont like the mouthfeel, but that caried over into the taste. Like drinking air that has spicyness. Not a real fan. The taste has very limited hop presence with a ... no wait no malt prescence because it was so carbonated I couldnt taste a damn thing...  M: Light, dry did I say light? For being so alcholic it doesnt carry over into a unique taste or mouthfeel. Just like an extremly fizzy beer with very few good qualities. Carbonation waaay to high, and I know its a Belgian, which apparently gives it supernatural qualities, but Im calling it saying I think what they did to this beer sucked.  D: I struggled and struggled to finish my 750 mL, but ended up tossing the rest. If you want a quick buzz go for it. But a good beer? Try DFH or stone. Because all I tasted here was hype.

Nice light spices, fruitier than i remember, some bananas, apples and fresh peahes. sweet and nice.  Taste. Dry and peppery. Light fruit flavors- some apple and spices- just a touch of clove. High carbonation and high alcohol gives it a nice bite on my tongue. Good yeast character. Aftertaste is just slightly tart, and has more pepper characteristics.  Mouthfeel. Tons of carbonation, just the slightest sip will fill my mouth from that carbonation. Body is about medium and behind the carbonation it seems a little slick.  Overall, just an excellent beer. Honestly i'm not into it being so dry, but it is still great. I have mentioned the alcohol in some places, but i do think it does cover the alc content quite nicely. I would love to have this again and again, but personally i'm a la fin du monde fan (sweeter).",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Fermentation aromas include honey and lots of fruit (apples and peaches) and also a spicy component that I pick up as peppery.  Huge pillowy white head that really fills the oversized tulip Duvel glass. Pale golden colored and clear with lots of inviting rising carbonation bubbles.  Flavor is very malt dominant. It's a full flavored of malt, mostly belgian pils flavors. Hop bitterness is pretty high but there's very little hop flavor or aroma. I get more of the honey flavor effect and nice yeasty-estery effect that is both like bread and fruity. There's a lot of complexity in the flavor but it's all so well blended that it is also really straight-forward tasting.  Body is mediud. Carbonation level is a little biting that adds to the bittering effect. Not at all alcoholic in the mouthfeel but it has a warming effect in the stomach.  A great beer. It's strong and complex enough that you could sip and savor it. But it's brewed to hide the strength so you could also drink it as a thirst quencher. One of my favorites.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Leave it sitting for more than a minute and it'll solidify into a legitimate beer merangue. Carbonation never stops and the lacing is unparalelled. Smell is actually of a slightly sour and spicy malt. Again, my first though was ""pilsner!"" though I know well that it's not. The taste is fruity, yeasty, and malty all at the same time. It has a lot of the characteristics of a belgian ale, but crossed with a german malt flavor. The yeast is there, but it's not the star of the show like many other Belgians. Mouthfeel's not as thick as you might expect from the head. Goes down easy and is VERY drinkable for a beer over 8% This is great!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Deconstructionis,3.58,"This is a hard beer to pin down. I'm not a huge fan of Belgian ales but then this is not really typical of Belgian ales  . It's way fruitier and more estery than I usually like but yet it somehow works, but just barely.  It's a hazy yellow with the most monstrous head ever. Huge and the word I usually use --persistent-- doesn't begin to do it justice. I think if you left it alone it would be perpetual; the beer would evaporate eventually but the head would simply petrify and be discovered by 23rd Century archeologists.  The aroma is yeasty and fruity with something else I can't describe in the background-- maybe rye bread or some spice. It is also very volatile for some reason; even with the huge head, you get a lot of vapors.  Tthe taste is extremely tart, fruity and on the verge of being cloying but it somehow finished very clean with just a hint of the bitter hops. It's not like the Trappist Ales and Lambics but there is noticeable alcohol warmth. Again, when /i describe the beer, there are alot of individual characteristics that are not usually to my liking, but for some reason I do like this.  The body is medium and it's to the dry side despite the sweetness, if that makes sense. The mouth feel is bubbles; it has extremely intense carbonation-- maybe more than any beer I've ever had including American macros. It is almost overwhelming and if you drink too much it feels as though it might come out your nose before you can swallow.  I'd label this more interesting and unique than drinkable. It's good but I doubt I'd ever be inclined to drink more than half a 750 and even that's pushing it.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,SilentSabre,4.23,"I have had and reviewed this before, but I felt that this was such a classic and my palate has changed so much since then, I should revisit it. It poured into the proper glassware a cloudy pale yellow with a big snow white foamy head that stayed around for several minutes. Thick sticky lacing clung like webs to the sides of the glass. Constant streams of CO2 bubbles travel upward fueling the foamy cap. Nice look ale, this. Smell is fruit, hops, and alcohol and in that order. Almost reminds me of a toned down tripel. Taste is more of the smell, with a semi-dryness to it countered by an appearance of cooked fruit. This is a little better than I remember it being, or rather, I am enjoying it more this time around.

222,695,Osiris9588,4.61,"Pours a pale golden color from a brown, 330ml bottle with a freshness date of 03/09. The carbonation results in a cyclone of spouting up through the center.  The white fluffy head takes up half of the tulip, it's creamy and stiff and I think would stick around forever if I didn't eventually take a sip. A merengue dome solidifies a good half inch abouve the rim. The foam around the edges eventually recedes, but a puffy, marshmallow plateau remains in the center. The immense lacing clings to all contours of the glass in an intricate spider web pattern.  The fragrant aroma consists of citrus, apple, honey, clove, yeast and malt. Flavors of lemon, orange, apple, pear, candied malt, clove, caramel, subtle hobs, and warming alcohol. The mouth is light and vibrant with ample carbonation, yet complex. Plenty of citrus dancing on the front, mellowing into a mid section of malt and spice, then finishing with a touch of hop, a citrus aftershock, alcohol, and a refined touch of syrup sticking sweetly to the lips.

The nose is filled with bananas and other light fruits and maybe a hint of lemon. Has some sweet malts and European hops. The mouth has these fruits all over it. Also some light grains and maybe some bread also. Theres sweetness in the taste and aftertaste. As warms you do get a very light warming in back from alcohol. Is thin/medium body with medium carbonation. Crisp and maybe a bit sticky. This is a very good brew. Great for a nice hot day.

Pour was complex, and even with the ""warning label"" regarding the relaxed pour, I over filled twice! Wow amd I out ofpractice!! The head, good god the head! Big, white and looks like a well-whipped marangue.  Smell - Yeast, yeast and more yeast (and malt)! There is a peppery spicy bite to the smell that barely comes thru the yeast presence.  Taste - Now that I've written the ""Appearance"" and ""Smell"" sections, the head has finally decreased low enough to enjoy! Very creamy presentation (due to the carbonation) with a crisp presence. I would have expected this to last for days due to amount of carbonation feeding the sip, but it cleared well with little after taste. A majority of what I tasted was a excellent yeast-based and malt-based balance with a bit of a spice finish.  Mouthfeel - wow, the depth is so pronounced. This is as close to perfect of a balance as I've had in recent memory. This is a dense beer, but not heavy at all. The density does not feel totally due to the carbonation present at pour. This is all taste, not air.  Drinkability - This is one of my top 5 beers. Please pass me another, and another.

Touches of yeast, bready, clove, some bananas, spices. It starts off rather sweet and evolves into a very tart and semi-dry finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied but feels very light, champagne-like carbonation - tons of tiny little bubbles. This beer, in many ways, does remind me of a fine glass of champagne.

222,695,zebedee,4.06,"At 2 quid a bottle, this stuffs dearer than petrol, so heres hoping it doesn't taste like it too! Admittedly, I've already had this before, but the glassware left something to be desired. I still haven't got me tulip glasses yet, but anyway, I digress.  A - Poured into a large bowl type goblet, which I guess, is just a big wine glass. A pale straw coloured liquid flowed from the stubby bottle, filling the glass and producing a 3cm head of fluffy, almost pillow like froth. Actually, 30 seconds or so after pouring, the head increased somewhat in size, fed from a constant upward stream of fine bubbles, until it was teetering over the brim. A marvellous sight indeed. All I need now is a flake (cliché). Plenty of lacing left on the glass as it slowly emptied.  S - Spicy, citrus. I picked up a strong alcohol smell initially, but as the beer warmed/oxidised it faded. Cloves, cardamoms, faint cinnamon lemons and tangerines. Not overpowering in the least. Very pleasant indeed.  T - The first sip, after fighting my way through the deep sumptuous head was dominated by alcohol. It kind of reminded me a bit of gold label and special brew from my formative years on various parks and bus stops. Not good. However, subsequent sips produced a more satisfying result. The alcohol taste diminished, leaving a faintly sweet citrus and clove taste, with a hint of freshly baked farmhouse bread. This stuff must be wholesome.  M - I wasn't hoping for something chewy here, and I didn't get it. Quite a light mouth feel, subtly carbonated. In fact, I feel the light mouth feel of this complements the taste nicely. Nice residual coating after the beer descends the gullet.  D - The price and the alcohol content are prohibitive for me, being the piss poor lightweight I am. However, I don't think I'd want to session on this. It seems too good to just knock back without savouring every drop. Besides, Belgian beer, in quantity, has the tendency to put me on my arse, so there.  I'm not too sure if I scored this beer in excess of its worth, as I haven't reviewed that many beers, or tasted that many of this particular style. However, even Carling swilling philistine friends of mine have been impressed with this, so maybe it deserves its score.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Absumaster,4.33,"Duvel is just a style on it's own and although I was somewhat sceptical before reviewing it, I have to agree with a lot of people.  Color is bright yellow golden and it has a extremely stable head and a lot of carbonation. Smell is odd, sulfuric with bananas and the alcohol is present. Taste is dry and bitter like a good lager, but with more malt and alcohol in it. There was also a kind of greenish taste, but this is probably the DMS. I also have some associations with hay or straw. Could this be the malt or the hop? Duvel is very drinkable, but hits you in the head after 3 glasses and even then I don't feel like quiting.

As it warms up a bit, the alcoholic content is noticeable in the aroma. Upon tasting, as with the aroma, the malt and citrus-like yeast character are out front with a very light hop accents on the finish. As it warms up, the alcoholic strength is more evident.

Poured in its own wide chalice it creates a thick head that slowly settles. The color is yellow with lots of bubbles.

222,695,BuckeyeNation,4.88,"Effervescent Spanish doubloon gold beneath a massive alabaster head of frothily creamy foam. I don't have a Duvel glass, but I do have a flared-top snifter that is almost identical other than the decal. The cap retains a melty, bubbly, 'scoop of mousse' look as it falls and leaves a wonderful array of abstract patterned lace on all available surfaces. As I knew it would be, this is one gorgeous beer.  The nose is no slouch either. It's immensely golden fruity (apples and pears) with more than a little musky hoppiness and an equal amount of spicy yeastiness. BSPAs are similar to my favorite Belgian style (tripels) and this one is the equal of all but the very best of those. A wee whiff of alcohol adds strength of purpose.  At long last, the great Duvel has come into contact with my taste buds and I have to say that it's everything that I'd hoped it would be. It's amazing how such an aggressively flavored beer can be so light in the mouth, so gentle, so dreamily drinkable. I think that Brouwerij Duvel has it wrong when they recommend drinking this fine ale at 40-50 degrees. I started my bottle out at 50 and the flavor is becoming deeper and more complex as it warms.  The flavor profile is a nearly perfect combination of sweet and snappy pears, lemon zest and peppery-clovey yeast. Just when I think that one member of that trio is most dominant, the others catch up and overtake it. I'm stunned at how compulsively drinkable this beer is; my hand keeps reaching for the glass instead of recording my impressions. As with all great high ABV beer, alcohol is noticed on the palate, but is such an integral part of the whole that eliminating it would make for a lesser flavor experience.  There's too much flavor, too much underlying sweetness and too much glorious hoppy bitterness for the finish to be considered clean, but then I've always though that clean finishes were overrated. The final few ounces (which have come much sooner in this review than usual) are even more chock full of flavor and even more peppery, more tartly fruity, more noble hoppy and more delicious.  How do they make the body/mouthfeel so cumulus cloud light and airy, yet substantial enough to keep the beer in contact with the taste buds for so long? I got used to highly carbonated Belgian beer a while ago and now wouldn't have it any other way. This stuff is pure pleasure in the mouth and the angelic mouthfeel is a big reason why it's disappearing so devilishly fast.  I had a pretty good idea that I would like Duvel when I finally got around to trying it. I didn't realize, however, just how truly special it is. I don't know if 'it's a style unto itself' as the brewery claims, but it's certainly the best BSPA that I've ever had the pleasure to consume and is the new gold standard by which all others will now be judged.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Very grainy, bitter finish, preceded by a floral hop note. This is truly like a Belgo-fied double pils. A wonderful, spicy alcoholic taste.  Mouthfeel is medium thick, and very highly carbonated.

Subtle flavors of banana, bubblegum, and spice, with some bitterness and slight tartness on the finish. Very well balanced, and the whole is more than a sum of its parts. Very nice.  Mouthfeel is crisp at first, but with a very creamy body as well- really perfect for this style.  Very drinkable- perilously so.

The color is pale yellow to amber. carbonation is indeed one of this beer's strong points. Smells of yeast hops and lemon zest hit your nose along with the alcohol and fruit. A clean fresh lemony taste followed by a slightly sweet fruity taste. There is a dark alcoholy aftertaste that is quite nice. Very clean mouthfeel. Even though this is a strong beer, it is very drinkable and I would love to have a couple of these 750's at one sitting.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,BretSikkink,4.5,"330 cl bottle into Duvel tulip. Mammoth head - pour unhurriedly indeed.  Liquid gold sums up the appearance nicely.  Taste is godly. Just a beautifully balanced bruiser at 8.5% - eminently drinkable, too much in fact. The only thing keeping me from a 5 in taste is a slightly cloying sensation as the beer sweats in the Chicagoland humidity. Is it banana? Clove? The alcohol presence really exerts itself as the bottle winds down and warms up.  Overall a beautifully crafted beer. Kingpin of its style, and given its generally good availability, I would say I will be drinking this again and again with no compunctions.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,demcorhip,4.18,"Appearance Poured with a huge solid head even though it was slowly poured with care. White head almost with body of whipped cream persisted while the beer was enjoyed, leaving thick white lacings inside the glass. Beer was clear and light gold in colour.  Aroma Sweet and fruity, more lemon than coriander. Bready smell, and there was also a hint of alcohol.  Taste Very clean tasting, with a lemon/coriander bready flavour. Accentuated with just a hint of hops.  Mouthfeel Wonderful creamy head. Was slightly tart. Flavours very well balanced and clean.  Drinkability An amazingly easy beer to drink. While their was a hint of alcohol in the aroma it was not noticable while drinking and tasting. A wonderfully decadent session could be had with this brew. This is something ill be enjoying again.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,warriorsoul,3.95,"Finally cracked open my 750ml bottle.... Straw in color...two full fingers off bright white head that sticks around for most of the glass and produces some thin lacing. Spicy aroma...banana, mild clove, lemon zest. Semi-sweet and very well balanced with all of the items mentioned above...the alcohol is adequately masked. A generous hop bittering shines through too. Mouthfeel is smooth, yet quite carbonated...finished dry and clean. Dangerous one here...goes down too easy and is well received from me this time of year. A must try if you are working to expand your pallet towards the style.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,dblinkhorn,4.1,"Poured from a 750ml bottle in an 11.2 oz glass tulip goblet.  Appearance - Straw color and very, very clear. No haze whatsoever. Four to five finger head at first, even with a very slow pour. Dissipates to a constant half-finger head that laces all the way down the glass, also thick and velvety.  Smell - I smell plum, fig, and floral aromas. It is a very pleasing smell from this beer. A slight spice smell is also evident. The alcohol smell is well hidden.  Taste - Moderately sweet. I can taste plum and fig, as with the smell. The finish has a very slight alcohol burn, not overpowering at all. I can taste a bit of nutmet as well, and the spice is more evident than in the aroma.  Mouthfeel - Nice level of carbonation. Only slightly more than ideal, in my opinion. It doesn't turn to foam in the mouth. Very smooth in my mouth.  Drinkability - Very good. The flavors are complex and refined. It is very smooth and the carbonation is near ideal.  Overall this a very quality Belgian ale. The flavors are strong but not overpowering. The mouthfeel is smooth and pleasurable. It has a very nice smell as well. I definitely recommend this to anyone who likes Belgian ales.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Super light and fluffy  Smells of fine,herbal and spicy belgian yeast upfront and semi-sweet Pilsner malt. Fresh herbals, golden wheat, dry leaves and green veggies round out the nose.  The most impressive aspect of this classic is the BALANCE. It's perfect, with semi-sweet, crispy, wheat flavored malt. The malt is super light and crispy pilsner malt. Very herbal and spicy yeasties combined with a green, leafy hop finish. right on. The yeast is packed with flavor, earthy, musty, wheatie, sour grapes...it's got it all! and the clean, crispy pilsner malt adds a sublime edge that forces you back for more!! The finish also has a bitter, earthy, dry and tangy yeast/hop flavor. To be honest, I feel most American brewed versions pale in comparisson to the lively energy in the yeast strain that provides so much unique flavor.  Feels very clean and crisp, refreshing and active with a decent bite and gritty, dry edge, with a Belgian smoothness at the end, extremely complex feel. Lush and velvety going down and the perfect, dry finish.  This is a pure classic.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

(Note that I couldn't find a real Duvel Glass for this so you may have to void certain things I saw like the nose)  Appearance: WOW! HEAD GALORE! Tons of effervencense comes up through a beautiful hazy straw color.  Smell: I smell grain, there's probably something else there but that's all i'm picking up.  Taste: It tasted like sourdough bread almost.  Mouthfeel: Best creamy head ever. The beer itself is actually kinda thick and smooth. I get a little tiny bit of a grainy bite but not much.  Drinkability: I could easily drink 4 of these and be retarded but I would feel retarded because why would I spend that kind of money unless I bought it outside of a bar. I would hope that I would be able to appreciate it well enough after 2.

222,695,cproioi,3.37,"The General Manager of The Beer Sellar Bought this beer for me, which I am greatly thankful for.  This bottle conditioned beer pours a straw yellow almost to the color of American Macro Lager but not as urine looking. Pours a huge fluffy white head that takes forever to disipate. It took a couple of minutes, close to 3-5, for me to pour all the beer into my glass. It smelled strongly of Belgian yeast with a nice amount of malts. The taste followed the taste with a fruity yeasty taste with the sweet malts but left my palate with a semi dry body that was suprising for such a thin body. I was expecting to be extremely dry but it had just a bit of the residual sugar build up on my tounge. It was a nice beer for a hot day, which it was 94F with a heat index of over 108F.

A tough beer to pour, it says ""pour unhurriedly"" right on the bottle and they mean it! You have to lay your glass nearly sideways and pour very slowly when starting to pour to avoid a huge head build up. Taste is good, and clean, with a little bite at the finish. Tastes fairly simliar to a pinsler except with loads and loads of flavor. A hint of fruit, and maybe a breath of peach are present too.

222,695,Backer2004,4.15,"Even though I could have tried a Duvel since October, when NC popped the cap, I always held this one in higher regard and wanted to wait until a special occassion. Last Saturday night was that unnamed special occassion.  Unfortunately, this was given to me to pour in a 20 oz. pint-type glass. Lots and lots of head, some due to my bad pouring. This one just typifies a very good Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Perfectly balanced with hops and malts, not hot at all (very smooth). Nice mouthfeel and easy to drink. I've enjoyed others by this style even better, but in my opinion, this one should be the standard of high quality..",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,instrumentality,3.78,"I was limited to pint glasses for this one, which perhaps wasn't the best container. I poured the contents of this tiny bottle slowly enough where I didn't expect 2/3 of the glass to fill up with foam. It fizzed like a soft drink, and the fluffy, bubbly head took its time to settle, clinging to the sides of the glass and leaving a small cloud settling on the pale, transparent yellowish liquid beneath. I added more beer and once again, the head rocketed up. I waited a good 5-7 minutes, hoping that with time I could eventually empty the entire 11.2 oz bottle into the glass, but eventually I ran out of patience and decided to deal with the foam mustache I'd be receiving.  The smell, which shot out of the bottle as soon as I popped the cap, was a wet, malty, biscuity, and phenolic/band-aid odor.  The first sip (foam mustache included, although the foam was so light and fluffy that it was easy to get through to the liquid beneath) was very malty with piney, somewhat bitter hops and just a splash of banana, and a slight creaminess in the body. The alcohol was barely noticeable, amazingly enough considering the 8.5% ABV. A bit too much malt for my taste, but I could still appreciate the moderate complexity of this beverage.  I had Duvel once before and I remember not particularly enjoying it. I'm still not overwhelmed by it, but it's definitely palatable and very easy to drink. I'm not so sure about paying $3 for a 11.2 oz. bottle, though, but then the liquor store where I picked it up isn't known for reasonable prices (I also paid $10.99 for a Chimay Blue).  I'll grab this one again, preferably in a 4- or 6-pack if it's available.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Estarrio,4.38,"Pours a pale blonde color. The head is white, frosty, persevering and reminiscent of a white water rafting experience. They are not kidding when they tell you to pour unhurriedly!  The aroma is subtly sweet, floral, and fruity with a slightly citrus feel. The esters mix well with candied sugar, doughy yeast and acidic citrus notes.  Taste is sweet at first of light fruit, champagne and coriander. This quickly mixes with a contrast of equal warm alcohol and slightly bitter hops. The aftertaste is a pleasant mix of all the flavors combined. Lots of esters, candied sugar and earthy yeast qualities throughout.  This light bodied, well-carbonated brew is a pleasure to sip.  This is one of the defining Belgian strong pale ales and it is easy to see why.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,dfried,4,"Clear yellow straw-like color, giant frothy and oily white head. It looks very much like a pilsner minus the head. The aroma is very sweet and a little fruity from the malt and candy sugar, with a little citrus-like character from the spicy hops. The taste is of a nice thick syrupy Belgian, but sweeter. A lot of esters in the flavor some tart apricot, almost cherry like, and then even some white grapes. Hops are there, mainly for balancing though, they just add a little tangy-ness to the mouthfeel, which is pretty light and tingly. Dangerously drinkable at 8.5%.  I do recognize this as a landmark beer, and respect it for that. And I think it's really good, but I feel like some gush over it a little more than it deserves.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,TheFeintingGoat,4.24,"An 11.2 oz. bottle poured into a snifter at a very unhurried pace (a must!).  A - A medium golden color that blends very well with the thick, foamy, epic head. It is very carbonated, and something about the rush of bubbles makes me love this beer even more. Quite hazy as well.  S - If I can place this scent, which I'm not 100% confident in doing, it would be that of Lychees, more than likely from the yeast. It smells remarkably like a certain Alsace wine ""Gewurztraminer"" (try it, you'll like it). There's also a cracked wheat smell worked in there.  T&M - It tastes considerably lighter than its heavy apperance, and when worked around the mouth becomes a medium heaviness and develops a slightly chewy texture. As it's swashed around, it moves from tart to smooth, depending on the position in the mouth and this makes an enjoyable oral expierience. As tart as it gets, it is never overpowering, and always balanced but at the forefront. It never assults the palette as the slight fruity texture mellows it out. On the back, you never taste the alcohol going down, and for an 8.5% beer: marvelous. It seems to have just the right amount of carbonation to finish it off smoothly.  D - I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. It's accessible, interesting to the palette, and a perfect after dinner drink. I haven't found anything that would go well with this meal-wise (though I know nothing of Belgian food) as it always seems to steal the show, but working it in as a meal finisher is a must. This beer, however, commands respect--for a number of reasons. First and foremost is the price, 10.99 for four 11.2 oz bottles. I try to keep a four pack in the house, but at the rate they keep disapearing I might reserve it just for special occasions. Second, it's not a beer that you can drink a few at a time. It's layers command you to savor it and to drink one takes a bit. Well worth it though. Finally, it's 8.5% alcohol, and packs more of a punch than you'd think.  Final verdict - Well, let me start by saying I have a fairly heavy moustache (pssh to those who trim!) and there has not been one time drinking this beer that I've not sucked the stray beer out of it. I enjoy and respect this beer, and it's finally nice to find something truly good in a local grocery store (hannafords). Bottom line? buy this beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,RJLarse,4.1,"I picked up a couple of bottles of Duvel at a grocery store to taste, review and enjoy. I poured this beer in to a tulip.  Pours a pale yellow/gold color and is slightly hazy. A HUGE foamy head forms, and can barely be contained by the glass. Advice on the label is sound, pour unhurriedly. The head is very resilient and produces heavy, sticky lacing on the sides of the glass.  The smell is sweet. There are strong floral aromas and soft fruit scents. It smells like melons, cantaloupe, honey dew, bananas and some aromatic sweet spices.  The taste has a malted grain presence, but the fruit flavors are also prevalent. There is a mild hop finish, and a bit of an alcohol bite. The flavors are reasonably well balanced.  The mouth feel is crisp, dry and smooth. The beer is significantly carbonated.  This is a drinkable beer, but the ABV dictates moderation.

Its not a bad smell, but there is nothing distinctive that i can pinpoint in it, nor does there seem to be much variety in what i smell. the smell is, as i have rated it, average and comparable to many othere beers. The taste is amazing, generally i like my beer the darker the better, however, this beer will certainly be on my short list for awesome beers. the taste is clean and even refreshing, despite the high alcohol content, it is in no way overwhelming. there are hints of apple, and the aftertaste leaves you inclined to take another sip. the mouthfeel is terrific. this is extremely drinkable and one could easily find himself ordering one after another. i had tried this beer once before in scotland, and i remember it as haveing a more intense alcohol presence. i wonder if, like guiness, they alter their recipe slightly based on the market they are selling to, or perhaps there were other factors like food or serving type that contributed to my discrepency.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Started out clear golden with a thick white pillowy head with excellent lacing. As the bottle progressed, the appearance turned more hazy amber, still with the same head. Fruity aroma was prevalent from the beginning. Taste seemed a mixture of the fruit and also a hint of spice, possibly clove. The 8.5% alcohol was very discreet; present but not tasted.

222,695,hunteraw,4.33,"Since I reviewed La Fin du Monde last night, I thought now would be a good time to review this other heavyweight of the style.  Appearance: Big rocky white head, golden color, clear... exceptional head retention. Stream of bubbles coming up from the bottom of my chalice (no Duvel tulip yet). Amazing lace. Hard to imagine how a beer could look better.  Smell: Citrus, spice, and that trademark Belgian yeast scent. A hint of alcohol. Mouth is watering.  Taste: Sweet malt at the tip of the tongue, but only briefly before the bitterness takes over, with a Saaz spiciness. Slightly yeasty. Drier than La Fin du Monde, I think, and I'd say the alcohol is better hidden (granted, this is 0.5% less ABV). Some cloves and an apple finish.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, silky, but extremely carbonated. Almost want to let it sit for a while so I can taste more of the beer and less prickly CO2. Finishes very well on a dry alcohol note.  Drinkability: I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't like this. This could be a fine introduction to the world of good beer. One complaint: too much carbonation - I had to drink it slower than I wanted to ;) In the battle of the Belgian Strong Pale Ales, in my opinion Duvel wins, but it's tough to compare. While classified in the same style, La Fin du Monde is fruitier and has more body, while Duvel is dryer, more approachable, and looks better in the glass.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

As always this is a beautiful pour, golden clear with a head that filled the glass out. The head takes a minute to settle and the smell is of spicey hops topped back with a malt ester wind that carries the idea of alcohol. The glass is starting to be laced as I take the first sip. Truly an artful construction of a golden ale with high ester yeast. Slightly fruity and sweet with a spice zing from the hops and alcohol make a play on the tongue.

Smell - Somewhat floral with a very slight hint of hop. Could hardly smell any alcohol, though a bit was there. Spicy and a little fruity as well, just the distinctive Duvel scent.  Taste - Once it hits my tongue I can already taste the spice, not overpowering and not undetectable, the perfect balance. The hops come in next, and this Belgian Strong stands right up and shows you what its got. Nice hop bite in the finish, perfect for a Belgian Strong.

Sweet fruits and earthy yeast aromas abound as the baby takes her sweet time settling down. Tons of lacing. I left the yeast behind, so nice and clear.  Tastes like a dream. Slightly sweet maltiness abounds, and the finish is crisp and dry. The carbonation is definitely a factor here, it's almost like a drinking sparkling wine. Not for the beer drinker who takes two or three swallows every time they raise their glass. But at 8.5%... does anyone need to? There's just a hint of acid, maybe some lemon/orange zest... but the musty, earthy yeast notes (which are mild) keep things in balance whenever the hoppy bitter notes don't. Just amazingly well balanced with an incredible finish.  Dangerously sessionable, I'm not as high on the uber-carbonation as some, but it certainly isn't a bother, and it helps define this extraordinary brew.

222,695,TheBungyo,3.64,This is a pour to be thankful of. Straw colored body is topped by what you'd think of as a nitro tap head. Nose is just too faint for me. I get a smidge of lemon and what I can only call white grapes. Taste is pretty much identical to the nose ... I guess my gripe is that it doesn't do more. It's decent but there's just too much out there that I'd buy first.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Dewey0603,4.35,"This pours a yellow straw with a giant white foamy head. The carbonation of this beer is huge. The smell is wheat, candy sugar, and some citrus,lemon or orange? The taste is crisp refreshing citrus lemon, wheat, candy sugar, and spices,pepper and coriander. The m/f is light and well balanced with a great mixture of flavors. This is a classic beer that should not be missed. A beer for all seasons. Cheers.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

When served in a Duvel glass the bubbles do a dance that I could stare at like a lava lamp.  Smell is sweet candi sugar, slight hops, lemony zest and sweet, sweet malt.  Mouthfeel is excellent and refreshingly light, tingly.  I could drink them all day and all night long. Just excellent.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,hero27,3.58,"750ml bottle. Best before 07/11/06 stamped on the side. 8.5% abv.  Chunky white head..hazy straw color. Head retention is damn near ridiculous..and thick enough to eat with a spoon. Some small yeasties float aimlessly in the glass. Belgian yeast and robust spices take up the majority of the aroma. The flavor has a distinct bready quality to it, with accompanying orange peel, spices, lemon, and yeast. Carbonation a bit too lively for my taste, not quite as smooth as I remembered this being. This may be a brew that could reasonably claim to be the champagne of beers.. it's a classic Belgian ale that has been around forever and isn't going anywhere.  Thanks go to mynie for the bottle.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Beutiful nose promises wonderous Belgian yeast, pale malts, and sweet fruits. Entry bathes the tongue in soothing carbonation and communicates a palate-pleasing mouthfeel.  The finish is very tripel-like with the exception of the well-hidden alcohol. Sneaky, sneaky...little Devil.

222,695,denjen,4.15,"Bought at/Price: Woodman's / $5.99 750 ml Dennis: Duvel, translation: Devil, is one of the best examples of a belgian triple ale you'll probably ever have. Incredibly carbonated, the taste at first delivers a flash of tart yeasts and deep candied fruits...that is assuming you'll be able to pour a full glass on the first attempt. At 8.5% after a few sips you won't be feeling any pain, but the alcohol never takes over the simple tastes that are blended so well. Jen: I would have to say that the second time around with this brew is better (or maybe it is the sudden heat wave that makes it so refreshing). It is light and bubbly, with a bit of tartness at the end. It is smooth with an almost creaminess to it. This brew is well crafted and quite easy to drink, but be careful, it is 8.5%!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Pours a beautiful straw yellow with lively carbonation rising to the top much like a champagne creating one of the fluffiest heads I have ever seen! The head is thick and fluffy like whipped cream. Aroma is fruity, spicey and yeasty. Again, this is probably the most beautiful head I have ever seen! Taste is very dry and yeasty with earthy and slightly spicey flavors. Mouthfeel is light and crisp that can be quite prickly from the carbonation. This is definately a world class brew! I bow down even to the empty bottle as it is contained something of pure art that I greatly admire and enjoy.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,shererjt,3.78,"Poured an effervescent straw yellow with a huge, rich, long-lasting head. Aroma was dry malt, musty hops, and a good bit of Belgian phenolics. Great beer to look at and smell. Decent amount of alcohol in the nose as well. Light-to-medium body, which is pretty remarkable considering its alcohol content. Flavor had alcohol up front, some malt sweetness (though it was pretty dry), and a bunch of hop flavor. Not as much Belgian funkiness as some, but you'd definitely know where this one came from. Maybe some fruit in the taste. Had a bit of creamy smoothness in the mouthfeel that was quite pleasant. Also, very little fusels/harshness. Drinkability was probably as good as it could be considering the puch it packs.  Overall, a very nice brew and a good gateway beer for someone who is looking to branch out into Belgians.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,KlausKinski,4.03,"A true classic. Wide, foamy , creamy head, one of the biggest heads I've ever seen. Yeasty smell with peach aromas. The taste starts with a quite sweetish note, dominated by peach aromas, then , about the middle, the yeasts gives more fruity, banana like aromas, and the end is ruled by an surprising hop bitterness. This beer is , for me, an almost perfect compromise between complexity and drinkability. Recommended.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,jamie2dope,4.03,"Yet another beer that I have great respect for and therefore, deserves a review. Poured (appropriately enough) into a Duvel glass slowly, to form a huge white stucky head that faded into chunks of foam as it faded. Coloration was similar to what champaigne looks like, very lush looking. In the nose were some light fruity apple flavors, a touch of mild earthiness, pears, overall extremely clean. Flavors detected included spicy pepper in the beginning, fruit in the middle, and alcohol hitting you right at the end. Duvel is one crisp beer, and by crisp I mean that it is pretty big on the carbonation. This one seems to turn to foam straight away when sipping, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. I could see myself drinking a few of these and liking it more with each sip. I was never truly impressed with this beer until I gave it a fair chance, and began to appreciate the vast amount of complexities it has to offer. A superb beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Flavor of this beer is more bitter than most belgians. It opens with a sour/bitter almost champagne like flavor without the sweetness and has the characteristic finish of a belgian. Very dry. Not overly alcoholic, but more than I am used to in the style. It is a good beer, just nothing I would call exceptional.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Smell is yeasty peppery spices, malty sweetness, slight fruit and alcohol.  Taste is similiar to the nose. Strong bready spicy character. Bananna and citrus flavors. Quite sweet with a touch of hop. Finish is lingering fruity sweetness and alcohol.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy.  Overall, this is the classic BSPA. Dangerously easy to drink.

Color is brilliant, glowing cloudy gold. Now that's a beer. Aroma is a yummy extravaganza of a treat for the nose. Sweet delicious spice, banana cream and citrus candy. Taste is similar. I can't find any evidence of alcohol here, It would seem the Duvel is decieving and delicious. The mouthfeel is juicy, smooth and creamy with the thick retention.

Aroma is lightly fruity - yeasty, peppery. Clean, crisp spicy fruit in the mouth with adequate malt sweetness for support. Dry yet, somehow juicy apple-like esters and modest phenols. Very pleasant and refreshing for such a strong one. Clean, medium bodied, and well carbonated.  Thats just classic Belgian ale right there.

222,695,marcobrau,4.12,"Yikes! My first review of Duvel. I have to start out by saying that I've enjoyed this beer before, I just haven't got around to putting words to paper about it.  Duvel is one beautiful beer that is stunning in its simplicity. The head that is created by pouring Duvel in its own special glass is incredible and I don't know of any other beer that puts on quite the same display. The head is voluminous, taking up at least two thirds of the glass. I stop pouring and slowly resume the pour and the incredibly fluffy, delicate head (as delicate as a spider web) pushes itself up like tiny mountain range. Once the head slowly -- ever so slowy -- starts to fall it leaves behind sticky, spider web-like structures of beer foam along the sides of the glass.  The aroma is just as delicate as the appearance (pretty much to a fault), with just the softest, slightest hint of spicy hops laced with spun sugar. The mouthfeel is soft, soft like the finest pilsner. The flavor of this beer is of sweet, honeyish malt, balanced just perfectly by subtle hops and its own minerally dryness. Perilously drinkable, Duvel is despite its demonic name, an exceptionally delicate and pure brew. Although seemingly not quite as spicy and hoppy as I recall from years ago, this is still an exceptionally well crafted ale.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,waldowin,4.41,"From a 750mL corked bottle. Cork came out with a massive *POP*, nearly causing me to punch myself in the face.  Pours a crystal-clear light yellow, with an absolutely massive thick-as-pudding head that can actually be molded by your fingers. Intense carbonation visible, and not even slowing after several minutes.  Smell is of butter, flowers, and grapes. Very light.  Taste is of candy sugar, peaches, and a hint of toffee. Light, airy, and delicious.  Mouthfeel is intensely carbonated, but otherwise smooth and sweet. The alcohol is completely invisible.  Had the 750 all to myself, and loved it. Though more than that would require sharing, most likely.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Pingotas,4.24,"I almost always prefer the better brews at higher temperatures - I can discern the flavors better. Duvel is the exception - when chilled slightly, it comes alive with a zesty, almost perfume-like taste that wasn't there when it was warmed. I can barely detect any alcohol, at any temp range. The color is pedestrian, however, and the lacing/head unimpressive. Aside from the boring physical attributes, the gustatory experience makes Duvel a solid choice for any serious beer drinker.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Cresant,4.19,"Opened a 11.2 oz with a best by date of 11/08 and poured (poorly) into a wine glass. I did not pour agressively enough to get a lasting head. It peaked at about two inches and then receded leaving sparse strings of lace. I could revive the head somewhat by gently swirling.  The smell was very pleasant. Yeasty. Frosted flakes and wine.  Isolated streamers of bubble trickled up the hazy pale golden ale.  Malty grains and faint under-ripe bananas is what I tasted. A smooth buttery flavor gave way to alcohol as it warmed. The malt/hop balance changed to a strong alcohol flavor and smell.  I loved the mouthfeel. The fizziness made me swallow faster. A pleasant burn; a sensation that my mouth was filling with gassy bubbles, like latte foam and an overflowing soda. Crisp and active.  This one became more filling as the alcohol presented itself. The sparkling nature of this one reeled me in but then I hit a wall; I dont think I could drink more than one of these in a sitting.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,ultralarry2006,5,"Poured from an 11.2 oz' er into a Duvel tulip glass. First, let me say that this left the most amazing head and lacing that I have ever seen - simply amazing !! The foamy creamy white head was two fingers deep and, it never receded, it was two fingers all the way down. It left the thickest lacing I've ever seen, all the way from the top to the bottom. The color was a clear medium yellow gold, like a lager.  Aroma - fruity and estery, slightly spicy, and sweet, bready pale malt.  Taste - exactly as promised by the nose. Fruity esters, slightly sweet bready pale malts, and all balanced with subtle spiciness from both the laid back hop profile and the yeast, and even possibly, the high abv. The alcohol in this was totally not detectable in the taste, except, as noted to lend a subtle spice note, and this, to me is excellence in brewing a high abv brew. All the components are harmoniously balanced, and they finished together in a clean, crisp, refreshing way. I completely savored every sip.  Mouthfeel - a delicious fullness, with moderate cabonation. Clean finish. Ever so slight hop slickness.  Drinkability - this goes down so very easy and is completely satifying that you have to have the next one one. The high abv is totally not evident from the taste, and only after you've had a few does that fact sink in. Still, if you don't have to drive, or be to work in the morning.. well, try not to get carried away, the hangover's a b&%#$ if you do. This is excellent beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

The aroma is of oranges and lemons with a barnyard funk in the background. It is rather mellow, however, more mellow than other strong pales that I have had. The taste is of citrus with an earthy and alcoholic finish. The mouthfeel is medium-light bodied and very dry. Overall, this beer is easy to enjoy. However, I choose La Fin Du Monde over Duvel anyday, as La FIn is so much more complex.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Pours a transparent gold color with a huge fluffy head that recedes leaving lacing like you see in your dreams. Smells good. Sweet bananas and overripe melons. Taste is spiced and fruity. Lots of melon and banana (like the smell) but also a very pronounced clove. Mouth is medium, silky smooth and dry. Perfection, really.

The head is monstrous (so much so that I was tempted to eat it witha spoon), the loud uncorking was a harbinger of this foamy beast. The smell is sweet, faintly citrus (orange peels come to mind), but not overwhelming. The taste is slightly sweet and nonalcoholoic. The after taste is pleasantly crisp.

222,695,nlmartin,4.71,I poured the beer into a Duvel tulip glass. The best by date was 10 of 2008.  Appearance: The beer poured nearly flawless. The color was a very pleasing golden yellow coloration. There was a rolling boiling carbonation present in the glass. The head was one and a half inches thick white coloration. The head was nearly immortal and never resolved. There was thick lacin remaining behind on the glass. This is one sexy looking beer!  Smell: The beer is loaded with a very nice peppery lemon zest citrus punch. There is a nice fresh bread smell to the beer. The beer has a wild yeast (Brett) smell.  Taste: Holy molly Batman! This beer delivers on the smell. The beer has a pleasing maltyness. The beer has a nice hop combo. The beer has a great citrus and peppery goodness taste.  Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer is medium bodied. The beer is crisp with a dry finish. The beer is well balanced. This is a very tasty beer treat from the Beer Gods.

Aroma: Classic Belgian, almost a Unibroue yeast smell, aromatic malt, white pepper spice  Appearance: Many tiny carbonation streams feed a full white chunky head. Lace hangs over the downward edge in big soapy rings. Glass is a pale gold  Flavor: Aroma broadcasts the flavor pretty accurately. Clean light malt, crisp hops, Belgian yeast, and pepper. No alcohol noted which might be why some call this the Devil!  Mouthfeel: Strong carbonation at almost champagne level, light body, lingering finish  Overall Impression: I first tried this about 3 years ago just as I was getting into BA, and I was disappointed; too much bite, just too funky. Now I find it to be much more enjoyable. I like the Belgian aspects, but the carbonation level is just a bit annoying to me. Even though Im not wowed, I respect the craftsmanship and enjoyed the stubby little bottle (which will see many future homebrews).

222,695,RenoZymurgist,4.57,"I didn't have a Duvel Tulip so I used my well traveled Chimay chalice. Poured a crystal clear straw gold with tons of little strams of CO2 witha thick foamy white head that filled the top 1.5 inches of the chal,ice and then began to grow in the center forming a plateau like foam layer above the rim of the glass. It leaves thick lace on the sides of the glass. The aroma is very dry with a slight bready note and a spicy and fruity character. Very balanced and not overpowering at all. The flavor begins with a crisp rush of the carbonation and then the sweet light malty flavor settles in and blends with a delicate yet very noticeable spicyness from the hops. Then the malt backs away and allows the spicy hops to blend in with the fruity esters and then the whole thing finishes so clean that it is as if you never took a drink at all. For some reason the yeast character reminds me of Ommegangs brews. The mouthfeel is perfect as the carbonation is high enough to give the sweetness of the malt a perfect balance so as not to be cloying. I find it very hard to believe that no kettle sugars were used in this ale as it has such a clean flavor and is so drinkable. I bet i could convert many Bud drinkers to this if it were cheaper and more readily available.

Very thick lacing is everywhere as this goes down.  Smell  This beer smells quite good. Lemons are very present along with some orange peel, pepper, and strong yeast. I really like what I smell here but it could use a little more punch.  Taste  The taste of this beer is remarkable. It leads with a spicy yeast flavor which quickly transforms into a bombardment of citrus. There is a slight hoppy bitterness as well with traces of alcohol. This beer makes you want to savor every drop.  Mouthfeel  This beer almost has a light creaminess to it. Good body anyways. The carbonation is high but does not bite hard. There is a touch of dryness to finish as well. Cant complain at all.  Drinkability This beer hides its 8.1% ABV so damn well its scary. I can drink this effortlessly. Perfect drinkability.

Great golden color, slightly opaque. Poured with a HUUUUGE head...luckily, it came with pouring directions, and if you look closely at the little inch tall picture of the final pour, it has 1/2"" of head (ie, half the glass) so I felt a lot less dumb having 2-3 inches of thick, frothy perma-head. I felt like Willy Wonka had slipped a fizzy-lifting roofy into the bottle! Poured some into an Ommegang Hennepin glass, some into a chilled glass mug.  Taste is light and crisp, aided (in some ways) by a fairly heavy carbonation. Hints of citrus, a bit of hop, and a big yeasty explosion of flavor. As has been pointed out before, you barely taste the alcohol in this bad boy. However, the carbonation definitely leaves the mouthfeel lacking...too close to weak soda, in that its there, and then it disappears...there is too little tail on the taste, too little ability to savor the lingering taste between sips. However, when you do sip it....utter beer bliss.  This is definitely a drinkable beer, almost dangerously so. Definitely good stuff. When there's a lot of alcohol, I prefer to know it bodily.

Really full and rich, but clean and crisp at the same time. Buttery, spicy, slightly fruity. Mmmmm  Mouthfeel is crisp and bitey, with a medium dry finish.  Way too drinkable for 8.5% -- you can't taste it at all.  Note: left three ounces in the glass and swirled and dumped the yeast in. Let it settle a bit -- in my mind, this completes the beer: makes the head huge and rocky, rounds out the mouthfeel, dries the finish, and fills out the flavor. Much better.

222,695,nickss,3.71,"750 ml corked bottle. Best before 9/08 Pours an straw-golden yelllow with an unbelievably immense head. The brew is moderately cloudy in appearance due to the bottle fermentation, but through the yeast I can see millions of little bubbles struggle their way to join their brethren at the surface. Maybe the most beautiful head I have ever seen on any beer.  Initial spicy saaz hop aroma... very pils-esque (not a positive feature in my mind, but that is just my personal preference of course). This is followed by a huge yeasty backbone. Lots of citrusy lemon zest. Malt is easily identifiable in this brew as well, although it takes back seat to the other aromas.  Perhaps it is the intense carbonation in this brew, but I have a hard time discerning any strong independant flavours. Lots of yeast, but other than that, somewhat boring. Perhaps a bit of doughy breadiness. Kinda disappointed here. It's not bad by any means.... I just don't see what is so spectacular about it.  This brew is way too highly carbonated in my opinion. Carbonation destroys the flavour in this case, and makes the mouthfeel too tight and dry. While the overall thickness of the beer is about right, the total mouthfeel is only average.  I have mixed feelings regarding the drinkability. For one, the 8.5% abv is nowhere to be found in this light crisp beverage. On the other hand, the carbonation is so extreme that it kinda ruins this brew for me. So I will leave it at this... while I think this brew is different, and I respect that, it is not for me. I doubt I'll be dropping $8 for a 750ml again any time soon.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,jwc215,4.73,"WOW! I poured this into a Duvel glass. It pours a gold color with an amazing, almost overwhelming head with high carbonation. It smelled floral with a tinge of alcohol. The taste was like biting into a lightly sugared, spiked green apple. It was very refreshing and unique. I ordered another and let others taste it and everyone was simply amazed at the unique flavor. This is a beer unto itself. The taste of alcohol does become apparent, otherwise it would be endlessly drinkable.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Like shaving cream on top of the beer [and it lasted until it the beer was finished]. Tons of carbonation can be seen. Pale yellow.  Aroma comes flying at you...many different things...lots of citrus [lemons, orange]. Spicy. Very nice.  The taste is wonderful. Light, creamy. Again, alot going on here: pears, spiciness, pineapple, citrus, etc. Light hops. Quite complex.  The mouthfeel is nicely balance and cleansing. Overall, a very refreshing, crisp and wonderful pale ale. Very impressive. Amazingly, I didn't taste the 8.5% ABV, but I defnitely feel it.

Light golden color with a MASSIVE foamy head (fills half the goblet) that stays around forever & clings to the sides of the glass. Tons of bubbles rise to the top, especially a pillar of carbonation in the middle where the stem meets the bottom of the glass. Aroma is very sweet with hints of fruit. Taste is surprisingly dry considering the aroma. There is some initial sweetness followed by a dry, white wine type of bitterness. There is a sharp, spicy bite of yeast, hops, and alcohol in the swallow, but nothing overwhelming. Medium mouthfeel that tingles on the tongue from all the carbonation. All in all, pretty good stuff!! Not quite on the level of say, Delerium Tremens, but not a bad 2nd choice, either.

A pepper-like quality sneaks in, along with some citrusand the 8.5% ABV is nowhere to be seen.

Heavy belgian phenolic aroma like bananas and lemons, with a mild medicinal note. Noble hops and a pale malt background round out the nose. Whiff of ester as it warms. First sip is sweet pale malt, with zesty citrus and light fruity phenols gently washing over the palate. Mild yeast bite in the aftertaste, with a snap of well-attentuated alcohol that is subdued by a faint hop bitterness for a nearly perfect balance of flavor. The carbonation is high, but not overdone; the light/medium body and results in a lively yet extra smooth mouthfeel.

Every time I scooped some of the head out, it just kept coming back. Aroma was sweet and winey, almost champagne-like. The beer was quite sweet but had a dry finish with a slight herbal hoppiness. Duvel was smooth on the palate and had excellent balance between the sweetness and dryness. This beer is incredibly drinkable for the strength. In my opinion, this is the ""Champagne of Beers"".

Appearance is gorgeous: thick lucious head, bubbly as hell, excellent retention, never seen anything like this. Crystal clear (this is bottle cond.??) Aromas are estery, alcoholic, dried fruits are detected. Akin to any tripel or belgian pale I've smelled. Incredible carbonation tickles the tongue. Sweetness about with a little sour bite. This brew is struggling to hide the alcohol as it is ever so apparent. As a result, the drinkability suffers; I will definitely enjoy this bottle, but I don't think I could have anymore. Hops are nowhere to be seen. This is simply a mouthful of overcarbonated alcohol.

222,695,StevenGu3,4.34,"Appearance - Welcoming warm golden, very white headed, full of gas. Looks most appealing in its wide mouthed tulip glass (which also helps pouring) Slow pour means dead slow. If anything is off balance in this beer it is that it's on the over gassed side.  Smell - Sweet and yeasty, the thing I like least about this beer.  Taste - The gas hides the strength to a degree, it does not take much in the mouth to get good flavour. The beer is sweet but not fruity, slightly but not excessively yeasty, the aftertaste lingers beautifully, a wee bottle can be made to go a long way.  Mouthfeel - The beer bubbles in the mouth, once you get used to its high fizz its so easy to get comfortable with.  Drinkability - One to be slow sipped any other drink that night would taste inferior! The 8.5% alcohol tastes good, too often strong beers taste too strong.   I like it served a lot colder than is recommended, the cold takes a shade of the gas out. The small 11.2oz bottles are more fizzy than the large.

I really have a hard time describing the smell of Belgians.  T - First sip is has a spicy sweetness up front. I'd try and pick out the fruit tastes but I just can't so I'll leave it at that. In the middle there's a nice sweet maltiness and some hop bitterness to round things out nicely. I've had other Belgians that were just over the top in that yeastie profile - this one isn't. Everything seems to be balanced.  M - It's like a champagne. That's the best I can describe it. Refreshing with a somewhat tart and crisp finish. Not overly dry - just right on the mouthfeel. I actually think it's probably one of the better 'light' beers I've tried in respect to mouthfeel.  D - Each Belgian I try gets better and better with this one being the best. It could be I've grown accustomed to the taste or I just keep picking better beers. I'd like to think with this one, the latter holds true. Careful with this one - it doesn't have the heavy feeling of a 8.5% ABV beer. You could easily get hammered on this one without even knowing it.

Very faint odor, there's very little here at all.  Taste - mellowed sweetness, almost like an imperial pilsner flavor, but the Belgian candi sugar keeps it in the ballpark style-wise. As it warms, more of the Belgian sweetness comes through. Nothing fancy on the finish, perhaps a glimmer of hops. Some warm breathy alcohol, pretty decent on the whole.  Mouthfeel - vapor from the alcohol fills the mouth, very well-carbonated as you might expect. Well done.  Drinkability - good beer, not really worth cellaring though.

The result of this head is an incredible ring of lace around the glass.  Smell: The ale has a slightly sweet candied aroma to it. There are also peppercorns in the nose.  Taste: The ale has a light sweet candied sugar taste to it. Beyond the sugars, I pick up some spices that remind me of a good tripel: peppercorn being the taste on the forefront.  Mouthfeel: The ale's hyper-carbonation provides a welcome cleansing taste with every sip.  Drinkability: This ale is a winner.

222,695,bigdaddyv10,3.76,"11.2 oz bottle poured into a pilsner glass ( should probably get a tulip shaped glass to truly appreciate the complexity's of this beer ).  This is my first Duvel and have never had a beer quite like it.  Even though I gently poured it into my tilted glass the foam head quickly filled my pilsner glass 2/3 full of effervescent fluffy white foam, which was very slow to dissipate.  Duvel is medium to light golden color with lots of tiny bubbles that don't quit.  Smell is of hay,yeast, and fruit.  Taste is of hay, yeast, slight fruitiness, pepper and malt with a touch of bitter. I can taste the alcohol ( not to mention feel it ) but not so much that it is unpleasant.  Duvel kind of reminds me of drinking champagne with all the bubbles and the higher alcohol content but is most definitely beer with a unique taste that is hard to pin down. I think I will have to keep sampling these from time to time to get a better feel for them.  I bought a 4 pack of these at Corral liquor in Granite City IL for 7.99   This is my first post on a beer forum, and I'm not hip to all the Lingo, but I do enjoy Beer and trying new things and have been using this site to pick new beers to try, so hopefully I will eventually get better at my evaluations.

This is hands down the most beautiful looking beer I have ever seen. Straw colored with the most breathtaking stormcloud of white towering foam. If poured correctly you should have roughly half beer and half head in your glass. The head retention is pretty amazing and the lacing extensive. Really a site to behold. The smell is hay, pepper, and lemon zest. Taste is light, crisp at first. Taste of rich spices like coriander and pepper, a little lemon, and some nice buttery malts. Aftertaste is that wonderful spice flavor followed by a nice glowing warming sensation in your belly and body. This must be what it feels like to give your spirit a bath. Alcohol feeling is present and strong, but not so abundant in the taste. Still a quaffer and a sipper...take her real easy. Drinkability suffers slightly because of the high alcohol.

People will look at you and know you are well-versed in beers... but that is the least of concern, to you the drinker. The beer must be poured slowly, as the head gives rise quickly and without hesitation... patience is rewarded. The smell is light, but not mysterious. One can definitely detect a slight hint of weight, and also several fruits. An apple maybe, but definitely a little lemon rind. Very carbonated, and light in the mouth; combined with the taste it is fun to drink, but be careful. At 8.5%, the fun can get ahold of you quick...

222,695,vanrassel,4.23,"Duvel comes by its legendary status deservedly  a first-class example of its genre from start to finish.  It poured from the bottle into my snifter with a large, three-finger head that sat perched over a golden, straw-coloured beer with some cloudiness. The head had considerable retention, and remained till the end, leaving a sticky lace on the glass.  The smell was yeasty with fruity esters and a hint of malt  very inviting, though maybe not as complex as my favourite Belgian pale ale, Fin du Monde.  This is a pleasant, well-balanced experience despite its classification as a ""big"" Belgian beer. It hides its 8.1% ABV (that's what the bottle said  I know it differs from the info up top) well and goes down smooth. I personally favour a bit more carbonation than Duvel offers and marked its drinkability down only slightly because of what I perceive as a bit of a dry, astringent aftertaste.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,kkipple,4.58,"Any review of Duvel would be incomplete without first singing the praises of the head on this beer. The head on a glass of Duvel is massive, tremendous, and a joy to behold. It sits commandingly atop the clear golden beer and takes up nearly 2/3rds of the glass. The lacing is the best Ive seen. It just may bring tears to your eyes. In all seriousness however, the thick, meringue-like head on this beer is just the icing on a very tasty cake.  The smell overflows from the glass. I was initial concerned by a mild skunk tang, but that is soon left behind by a wonderfully sweet floral smell, along with the Belgian yeast that's typical of these kinds of beers. The smell gets sweeter as the beer warms, eventually leaving a nectar scent in the glass.  The taste is light malts with a mild bitterness, with hops, yeast, and mild alcohol present. There's a lesser wonderful spicy clove taste and a fine tartness to round it off. Finishes dry, warming, and crisp. The 8.5%abv is cunningly hidden, and the sheer drinkability of this beer means if you have a steady supply at hand you could be in trouble.  Drinking a Duvel is delightful. I strongly recommend you seek one out. It's just a fantastic beer and one that I can't wait to try again.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

The sweetness of the apples and cloves were apparent right away. Floral hops had a perfect balance that brought everything together. The taste became even better as it began to warm up. Bananas and citrus became more apparent then.  M - Carbonation was just right. Nice little kick in the beginning that made everything come alive. The hops hang on in the back for the entire ride.

And look at that head...I've never described a head as ""complex"" before, but here you have it: fluffy and well-retained, it's always abundant no matter how slow the pour, with a stiffness around the middle that reminds of meringue. One of the best looking beers, ever.  The aroma is a bit low-key: definitely fresh-smelling, with a balanced lightness, nothing is really dominant, all the expected smells of the core ingredients, plus fresh apples.  Taste-wise, Duvel is always a great recommendation for those just starting to move away from macros and into craft beers. It's not extreme but not at all unremarkable. It recalls a malt-soaked apple peppered with cloves and banana, with a subtle alcohol/yeast nip.  Feels light and crisp in the mouth, with a good bit of banana-like creaminess. Nice zing to the carbonation.  Very versatile when paired with food...just enough alcohol content to relax with...not so much alcohol that you can't have 2 or 3 in a sitting.

222,695,becktone,4.88,"I won't be the first to say it but this beer has absoutely the best appearance I have ever seen. It ends up being a pale golden color.Infact the color reminds me of lemon jello shots. The large amount of carbonation in this beer makes it look quite alive. The head can be described with the following: four finger, billowly, pillow-like, whte, rocky/craggy. Not only does the head look great but it looks great the entire time one is drinking it, excellent head retention. Also a great amount of lacing, this looks like one good beer.  The aroma of this beer is also good. Not quite as potent as I would like (the more potent the aroma, the easier it is to describe it). Don't get me wrong, it's not like the aroma of this beer is hard to smell. It's just that if I could hold on to the smell a bit longer and have it be a bit stronger it would be much easier to describe. I get a butterscotch aroma from this beer. I also detect small amounts of diacetyl. I don't detect any hop character. It has a very distinct aroma, however, I can't seem to put a finger on it. It does however smell great.  The taste of this beer is great. It is very well rounded and complex. I can't really describe it much more than that. It has a sweet candy-like flavor that is balanced by just the right amount of hops. I also detect some spicyness in the flavor of this beer. This beer may contain 8.5% alcohol, but you surely can't tell by the way that it tastes.  Feels great in the mouth as well. It finishes dry and has a champagne character about it. The amount of carbonation is high, but I believe that it compliments the complex flavor and style very well. It is certainly not light on the palate, it has a pretty full body. In fact, this surprises me because in my experience pale ales in general don't have a full body. They are usually light-medium bodied, whereas this beer has a full body.  This beer is by far one of the best beers that I have ever drank. It has a great appearance and a taste that is quite good as well. This is a beer that I'll be buying again and again. It goes down incredibly easy espicially for having such a high abv.

Golden, straw-like color with the fluffiest, most pillowy white head imaginable. The head seemed to explode right out of the bottle. Floral and citrus fruits make up the aroma. Mostly orange and lemon. The flavor brings out more of the the fruit and also has a spicy character to it. It matched perfectly with the meal I was eating at the time which I'll talk about in a minute. Big flavor that's easy on the palate. This beer really changes over time. It starts out crisp and spicy and as it warms, turns into a pleasant, mellow beauty.  I had this Duvel at a restauant paired with Alaskan black cod marinaded in mushroom soy and garlic served with a ginger-coconut sauce and sweet pepper salsa.

Way too intense, it makes ginger ale look flat. After it finally reaches a manageable level, rings of lace are marked down the side.  S - Floral notes dominate over fainter white grape, pear and banana odors.  T - A strong ascerbic hop kick initially, not a pine flavor, but more of a floral flavor. A bit of faint white grape and pear in the taste. There is a light-bodied maltiness and a lingering hop bitterness in the aftertaste. Abv is completely masked.

Almost looks like some forgotten water-carved desert valley in AZ. As I drink this beer, the head collapses and leaves big awkward clumps of head hanging out on the surface. The color of the beer is soft honey. Truly one of the most visually entertaining beers I can ever imagine drinking. The smell consists of tangerines and plumbs, an enticing spicy yeast and what I can only describe as dark brown lake water. These smells are magnificently intertwined with each other that make this really unique. Tastes surprisingly bland compared to the smell, but far from bad. Im getting some very dry grapefruit rind, black pepper and fruity orange jello with a medicinal, dry yeast finish. If I allow some air to stand trapped in my mouth, I pick up strawberries. I must add that this is the most prominent spicy yeast flavor Ive had with out it being too dry. The mouth feel is medium bodied with a lot of unobtrusive carbonation that disappears when I swallow. This beer is surprisingly simple, but wonderfully put together and an absolute delight to watch.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,MagicLantern,4.09,"Poured into a Pint Glass. I'll get a Duvel Glass soon.  Appearance: Pouring this beer for the first time was amazing. The whole glass turned into a thick head. And I when say thick I mean like cool whip thick. It looked wonderful and gave me an immediate appetite. The head was long lasting, slow to fade, and laced the glass perfectly. The lace was about 1/8"" over the beer through out my entire sample. It did not fade, break up or go away. I covered my beer and the edges of the glass was something to admire.  The beer had a rich gold color with the color deepening as it neared the center. My notes say, ""Translucent beauty."" A light carbonation bubbled through the entire beer and just made it look like what I imagine a beer is suppose to look like. For that reason I gave it a 5. Even in the wrong glass it was picture perfect.  Smell: Fruity, maybe banana. My notes are sparse here. I have written, ""Didn't smell bad, didn't smell great. Smell is subtle and light."" I think that's why I have it a lower rating. I just couldn't smell much.  Taste: Sharp! Bitter! Spicy! Yum! That's what I wrote and thats what I like. A crisp light burn follows from the carbonation which gives it a great aftertaste. I did not taste any sort of alchohol after taste. The flavors of this beer float in your mouth long after you drank it and it's a very pleasant feel in deed.  Mouthfeel: I want to point out that this beer got better as I let it warm. That is, it started great and finished better. With that in mind, it was smooth through and through.  Drinkability: I was going to give this a 4 for drinkiablity. It was a great beer that I could probably drink at anytime, but I didn't want to over rate. Then my girlfriend came along and she doesn't drink beer at all because it tastes ""like beer"". Maybe it was the note book, or maybe it was my crazed look, but she picked it up and said ""Let me try a good beer."" She tried it and said, ""This is fantastic."" This is the first beer my GF LIKES. That merits .5 doesn't it? So drinkability is a 4.5  Price: Reasonably priced the quality of beer. Buy yourself the four pack with the Duvel glass so you can drink this right. If you still not convinced accept the next one offered, you won't regret it.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,RedHaze,4.55,"Pours a pale golden color with a montainous rocky head that actually grew as it sat for a few minutes, and hardly fades away. There's tons of lacing left behind on my glass.  Smell; at first I was a little dispointed in the smell, as it came of more tame than I was expecting. I let it sit for a few and came back and it really opened up. It has a really nice lemony citrus and a spicy pepper like smell, with yeast and hints of bread dough.  Taste; that spiciness really jumps out at me, followed by citrus and a nice malty bread dough, with a bit of a grassy quality thrown in. There's enough of a hops to add just a touch of bitterness in the finish. I thought the carbonation would have more of a bite, instead it's really smooth and creamy, and very refreshing.  I had this beer many years ago, and didn't care much for it at the time, but now I have to say that this is one hell of a beer.

Pours beautifully golden slighly cloudy with a huge head into the Duvel chalice...really, really huge...fun to watch it slowly recede with nice lacing and little sinkholes throughout ( I'm sure there's a better beer geek term for that,sorry ).  Smells nice..malt, yeast , slight fruit.  Taste at first was a little disappointing...first few sips..""what's all the fuss about this stuff ?""...way too carbonated for me , interfering with the flavor. Anyway, that sure changed....once it de-gased a bit and warmed just a little, the complexity came out...there's so much going on on the palate...I kept looking at the simple gold color and wondered where all this was coming from. There's fruit, malt, sweet, hops, alcohol.. and more...all well balanced....every flavor I love in Belgian goldens was there in just the right amount. 3/4 the way through this glass I had decided that this is just a perfect beer and deserves all the praise it gets.  Drinkable....I would have a few. I'd love to make this one of those that's always in the fridge, but it's a little too pricy for that.  I told a few friends about this..and a few weeks later they said they had almost exactly the same experience...although you may resist initially ; the Duvel gets your soul in the end.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,skillerified,4.13,"Clear yellow-golden color that reminds me of apple juice. Mammoth, white, bubbly head takes up about half the glass. The head looks glued to the sides the way it's lacing. Lots of fine, champagne-like carbonation bubbles rising very rapidly.  Scent is very fruity. Pear, apple, and banana in particular. There's a caramel scent too. Smells pretty good, but I was expecting a little more.  Taste is more complex than the scent. There's the fruit (particularly apple) and caramel, but there's a spicyness too. I'm getting a slightly tart flavor too. Some grain-like flavors. Quite tasty.  Smooth and mellow as advertised. Mostly sweet, but with a refreshingly bitter finish. Feels very clean on the tongue. Light to medium bodied. Fairly well-balanced too. Pretty unique and almost refreshing really.  This is tasty. I'll have another and recommend it to my friends.

Very crisp malty aroma with plenty of Belgian yeasty fruitiness woven in. Has a nice breadiness to it as well. The aroma of alcohol begins to show as it warms.  This is delicious. A nice crisp malt taste followed by a fantastic fruitiness. This leads into a nice bready flavor with some tasty noble hops and finishes quite dry.  Full body and plenty of carbonation.  Too drinkable for an 8.5 ABV. This is a fine beer.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,SacoDeToro,4.14,"The beer poured a pale golden yellow with a huge white head that took quite a few minutes to settle.  The aroma was a wonderful bouquet of spicy Belgian yeast and fresh grainy malt.  The taste was warm and peppery with a smooth and moderate hop bitterness. The malt provided a creamy sweetness to balance out the spiciness and warmth from the high alcohol.  The mouthfeel was light considering the style and the carbonation was very high.  Many beers in this category have a tendency to be syrupy and cloyingly sweet. While Duvel is a ""big beer"" it manages to be complex and delicate at the same time. It is very drinkable and satisfyingly refreshing.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Here goes...  Pours a slightly hazy golden straw-like color with miles of white poofy head that leaves lovely lacing around the glass. The head won't stop! It grows and grows! Smell is malty and peppery- makes my nose twitch a little, actually. Lemon, lots of lemon. Spicy.  Taste is also lemony with a strong maltyness dominating. Some juicy fruityness and a hint of bitterness at the end. It's tasty, but... pale? I think is the right word. It just doesn't impress me like it should- the big WOW isn't there- it's just not flavorful enough.  Mouthfeel is lively and bubbley, smooth, a bit chewy, and crisp. Clean feeling. Overall a very drinkable brew- not overwhelming, and certainly easy to drink considering it's alcohol content. But it just doesn't do it for me like I'd like it to.

Fancy label, printed on good paper. hiyooo. This poured a gorgous pale gold color that kinda looks like a wheat beer, nice and hazy. Cool linear specific carbonation and some trippy yeast spots floating within(hey I tried to be careful!). The head is amazingly rocky and white. Very airy. I tasted the head and got stung by pepperiness! The smell is nice and spicy, citrus is there. Alcohol smell not kicking my ass though. And not in the taste either.

I don't mean to disrespect this great beer but, when I popped and poured, I was reminded of the old baking soda and vinegar days with a 2 liter plastic bottle . Just look at it the wrong way, and the head explodes. Goldenhoney colored, it hangs like gelatin in the glass when left to sit for a half hour; particles of carbonation or something else (yeast?) are suspended like grains of gold in amber.  Smells of alcohol, malt, yeast, apricots and spice. Tastes spicy and malty, like witbier, with apricot and a lingering mellow aftertaste of straw and apricots. Feels like a mimonsa in my mouth. Pleasantly viscous. I'll have another...for the rest of my life.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Very golden in color and very clear. Smell was lightly fruity and quite spicy. Flavors were not overpowering and it tasted somewhat fruity with hints of sour apple and citrus fruits, with a bit of the spiciness detected earlier in the aroma. There is a well rounded bitter finish to balance it out nicely. Mouthfeel is greatly carbonated, crisp, and not overly thin. The higher alcohol content is artfully masked.

Once out, the beer gave off tremendous fruity esters musty carbonation. Now I am not entirely sure how Belgian Strong Pale Ales are supposed to taste (well, yes I do) and this is highly disappointing. At first there is a wonderful tickle as it enters, then sour, plain sourness, almost like the beer was stale. I wanted to shake up the sediment to get a different taste.  One area I highly commend this beer in is it head. Meringue like from the beginning to the end. I will not be re-visiting this one.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

A bit of a yeasty taste, hops are in the background, but don't really appear till the very end. Feels sharp in the mouth, and dry later on. Feels very light. Hop bitterness is more pronounced in the aftertaste rather than the actual drink.  As it warms, some tart/sour notes appear in the early part of a sip. Alcohol aromas are more pronounced, but the nose is still very floral. More complexities in the taste now as well. Sour bananas, bitter hops, a bit of spiciness as well.

There are better looking beers and some have more complex, dense flavors and aromas, but this one goes down and drinks soo nicely. For an 8.5% brew to be so seductive, this is an amazing beer.  Inceidently, I think it's better from the small bottles, if you can get them.

This beer pours an enourmous, cream-white, snow-soft head that is uncontrollable and looks like a good creme brulee in my personal tulip. The color is a dark gold that's just cloudy enough to keep you from seeing through it. The head absolutely refuses to die down and remains a half-finger thick, thanks to tons of rising champagne-like bubbles! Huge lacing!  Smell is very faint but proper for the style of a golden ale - not much to say about it.  The taste first surprised me - here, thought I, is something very normal - until I swallowed and exhaled. Huge, floral, sweet notes blossomed on the back of my tongue and built through my whole palate, leaving a tiny, well-balanced bitterness and a sweet alcohol warmth in my belly (which my tongue completely didn't notice). TONS of sugary citrus, orange peel and gentle spice notes. Awesome!  Mouthfeel is really good - so much big-bubbled carbonated fizz which swirl the tastes across your tongue, but not enough to wash away the aftertaste, which is a plus because in my book the aftertaste is this beer's strongest point. Sweet and complex enough that I can't think of any outstanding flavors to describe it by. This is like champagne combined with beer!  Drinkability is totally exceptional. This ale has an astounding 8.5 abv - astounding because I don't taste it at all. I could, with dazzling ease, drink myself silly on Duvel.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Smell is intense, the head bringing out the volatiles, with lots of breadiness and spices mixed with bright fruits and a touch of hops. Taste is mostly breads and peppery spices, the yeast really bringing out some musty character, with bright Saaz hop bitterness in the finish. Fruits are apparent throughout, apple and pear alongside a touch of bright citrus. Mouthfeel is excellent, stellar carbonation persists throughout, and it is very crisp and quite refreshing for a BSPA, while still being warming and full enough to enjoy on a cold night. Equally suitable for drinking right after mowing the lawn or while curling up in front of a fire with a good book.

Huge white head developes perfectly in a tulip, as it settles it leaves chunky lacing and forms mountain peaks in the frothy goodness. Tons of fine carbonation billow to the surface. A touch on the unfiltered side but I've read this is from the yeast.  Yeast is evident along with some candied sweetness, some spiceyness.  Taste: Whoa this is one carbonated pup. Extremely crisp and sweet. Fruity and malty are the main focus but it somehow finish clean and bitter with a nice alcohol finisher.  Notes: This is a monster of a beer.

Do the beer gods smile down upon the Duvel family more than the rest of us?  Whatever their secret, this is perhaps the most uniquely outstanding beer to ever meet my lips. As you pour Duvel from its bottle (into your Duvel tulip, no doubt), a thick foamy head comes quickly rushing up, and with it smells from a thousand different points of light. Currant, caramel, fruit, sweet alcohol, the aforementioned rose - just a few of the notes in this veritable cornucopia of sensory orgasm.  This is also perhaps the most refreshing beer I've ever had.

This beer has a great balance between it hoppy character and a sweet taste to round out on the tongue. The great taste lingers in your mouth which is all for good.

This seems to me to be the perfect example of this style, even if its not my favorite of this style.  Pale golden straw with a fluffy dimpled pure white head. A few bubbles are in no hurry but definitely dedicated to their task of joining that clouds of froth forming into pads where a tower of bubbles does its part to maintain the cover for the duration of the drink. Smells really good, candy sweet and dry yeasty notes intermingle and caress my anxiously awaiting olfactory sensors. Taste is dryer, with just a bare hint of sweetness laced with dry champagne. The yeastiness noted in the nose is subdued, in part due to the carbonation coming alive and foaming on the tongue just as you begin being able to taste it. Hops finish up almost resinously bitter, but in balance with such a light malt profile. With a light body and that carbonation that sparks to a rolling boil in your mouth, the beer is pretty refreshing, and hides its 8.5% to a degree.

It poured out crisp and pale gold. formed a huge champange head that stayed floating till I was almost done. the smell was fruity and floral with a little bread dough. Taste was awsome. Sharp hops and sweet on the tounge. If it didn't taste so good I could easily chug these little guys down one by one. Awsome beer. going to buy the 4 pack next time.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,sockeye101,4.04,"Not knowing what I was getting my self into I grabbed a 750ml bottle of this one of the local Fred Meyer's and figured it probably wouldn't be anything noteworthy, seeing it was from Freddies. But man oh man was I wrong. Duvel has got it going on!!! Beautiful golden color and a massive, thick, chunky head that clung to the glass and remained there until the glass went in the dishwasher. Smell was sweet and fruity with malts and hops. The flavor was very distinctive and full of fruity tones and hops and malts. I highly recommend this Belgian.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,ahking,3.97,"A truly unique beer. Aroma is floral and fruity (pineapple, citrus). Pours a golden pale yellow color with a large sustainable head. Liquid gold. Its hard to classify the flavor of this beer as it is so unique. There is a sweetness of honey, apples, and cedar. This beer is quite hoppy, but balanced very well. Hops and malt are equally strong and each distinct -- they don't blend together on your tongue as well as a pale ale would. While this is lighter bodied ale, it is certainly not a weak beer. Alcohol is evident but not overwhelming. This beer gets very nice as it warms.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,maddamish,4.06,"Appearance: Poured a nice golden color. Clean and clear in appearance. This brew had a big creamy head to it that did not quickly dissipate. I had to let it sit for a couple of minutes before I could pour the rest.  Smell: Creamy sweet smell mixed with bread notes.  Taste: What a wonderful beer. Fruity, bready and sweet. Very creamy and just as smooth going down.  Drinkability/Notes: This is a solid beer all around. The drinkability is high but watch it, this is a higher end alcohol beverage that will sneak up on you. A beer for people who don't like beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Litterbean,3.83,"Pours a straw like yellow with an orange hue. Big fluffy head.  Smells of yeast and grassy hops. Underneath there's hints of sugary sweetness and fruit notes.  Crisp, clean taste. Pear, apple, and some faint orange in there. The use of pilsner malts is apparent. A leafy hop taste balances it out.  Good carbonated mouthfeel, and a smooth sipper. Not bad at all.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,wl0307,4.33,"750ml bottle--not shared with other beer lovers but just blissful me drinking this mighty beer in a huge bottle... BBE 09/2008.  A: the bottle pops open and pours into a big tulip-shaped wine glass a golden-hued nectar, coming with a fast effervescent, rocky, meringue like fluffy but bloody tight paper-white beer head with very good retention; the highly-carbonated body is not just fizzy--it's like raining/then drizzling bottom-up, or even like a hot spring!! Massive, it looks... the foamy cap sustains the best I've ever seen. S: fruit-esters, lemony+orange-peel, coriander seed and clove, candyish pale malts, while slightly woody aroma with sweetish edge and profound yeasty note sustains solidly in the background. Overall, floating, refreshing, lightly perfumy, and deceptively light!! T: refreshingly fruity malts on a bed of perfumy and vegetation-like hoppyness catapults the strength in no time! Then overwhelming yeasty flavour is combined with a thin-bodied citrus-fruity edge, slightly sour-sweet but very tangy, to cause a profound yet very floating mouthfeel of fruitiness. Pretty dry in the aftertaste, like being dry-hopped, but it doesn't stop there, as it becomes drier and drier, dragging all my senses onto a single point deep down the palate... and the woody yeastiness and hoppyness leaves more marks on dryness than on bitterness, which makes this beer extremely light and easy to quaff without even noticing the strength. M: exceptionally light and lively on the mouthfeel, this is one of those beers hiding their strength just too devilishly well. But for my palate the body is slightly too thin. D: overall this is hellu'va fine beer. I once saw a Belgian guy quaffing this beer straight from the (330ml) bottle at lunch time when I visited Mechelen, Belgium. While I was sipping ""elegantly"" a small bottle of Het Anker's Goulden Carolus Classic in a goblet, he drank Duvel like a Bud/Stella Artois/Corona, and he consumed two bottles of them in 20 minutes!!--now I could imagine why, but still disagree with the way the beer was ""wasted"". He liked it anyhow... and so do I in my own way.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Derek,3.82,"A: Crystal clear, slight yellow hue. Tons of fluffy, white head, decent retention. The lace really looks like lace!  S: Bready, pilsner malt. Clean hop aroma.  T: Bready, pilsner malt. Fruity yeast profile, with a touch of earthyness. It's a little cidery, though the alcohol is well hidden. Very well balanced... starting slightly sweet, with a crisp, slightly tart finish.  M: Moderate body, moderately high carbonation.  D: Should be approachable/enjoyable by all. Not a session brew though.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,EStreet20,4.78,"Well my batting order for trying the Belgians went Chimay, Corsendonk, and then Duvel and this was my favorite beer for a very long time. NEver got around to reviewing it till now.  750 ML bottle ppured into my Duvel tulip.  A - A 5 by far, especially because this is one of those brews that has its own look. It's a pale golden color with tons of carbonation feeding a HUGE head of pure white foam. Over all the time I've been drinking this I've perfected the pour that is desctibed on the bottle and illustrated by video on their website. A pale golden color up to the middle of the letters in Duvel and then a bubbly white head filling the rest of the tulip. Truly a marvelous sight. The most lacing I've ever seen in a beer.  S - The pilsner malt comes through in the smell along with some granny smith apple and an alcohol kick. The yeast is prevelent throughout as well.  T - One of the best balanced beers I've ever had. It seems like the malt sweetness, yeasty taste and slight hoppiness all take turns on this one. The alcohol provides a grand finale of warming at the end. Definitely a unique and wonderful taste.  M - A ton of champagne bubbles tickle the tongue. They make the warming feel even better.  D - I want more every time I take a swallow.  Notes: An old favorite. both sentimentally and tastewise. Glad I finally picked up a bottle for review. I forgot just how good and unique this beer is and I now remember why my avatar and desktop both feature Duvel pics. A truly great Belgian strong pale ale and A great change of pace for me from all the hop bombs and stouts I've been into lately. I love this beer. One thing I will say though is that I've never drank this beer without proper glassware and I don't know if it would be quite the same without it.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,JanM,4,"A well crafted beer that makes me happy. It pours with a bauta-head, and with rings of lacing like sediments marking every gulp. The color is light yellow and it smells of yeast and citrus. The yeast is coming to the fore in the taste as well, complimented with citrus and spices. It ends with a dry, bitter bite. The mouthfeel is very fizzy, a little too much for my taste. Unlike many other beers I tasted this one tasted better in the first sips.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

(i know, duh, right? well i was skeptical until that little experiment) regardless, it looks great, golden and wonderful  there is so much going on in the nose i don't know where to start, it's almost like perfume. complex, sweet but also a strong alcohol smell, buttery toast in the background with a nice floral fruity bouquet up front. every sip gives new insight into the world of better beer. my first taste and first review, but i will re-visit this brew soon. this is definitely one for reflection. jesum crow, what an incredible beer!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Oxymoron,3.85,"Sampled multiple times. About time to review it. Poured a off straw colored yellow with light hues of amber. Head retention was ample and remained throughout the tasting. Decent lacing as well.  The smell has a strong indication of Belgium quality. Some light malt with a touch caramel. More noticeable is the spices and fruity esters. Definite cloves and cinnamon as well as some bananas and a bit of pears as well.  The taste has a good malt backing with a basic taste but the real flavor is noticed in the spice, yeast and fruity esters. The spice has some good biscuit flavor that reminds me of an apple pie. The fruitiness accentuates this but has more of a banana taste. This becomes more noticeable in the aftertaste. And the yeast has a smoothness to it that is not overly alcohol even with a high ABV.  The body is med to high. Very easy to drink with low phenol flavors. Overall a good example of a Belgium is pretty widely distributed.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Finite,4.63,"This brew needs no help getting a head forming. The head is thick luscious and pure white with marvelous head retention and amazing lacing on the glass. Carbonization is a perfect flow of bubble. The colour is a dark lemon to light orange which is slightly pale. The brew smells of sweet fruits and well balanced spices.  The taste gets better as you go. At first I was unsure if I liked the taste but after a few sips I was enjoying it thoroughly and by the end I was I love. The flavors on the palate are unlike anything if witnessed. Its sweet but lemony with hints of pepper and spice yet in the background at the back of my throat is the alcohol, untouched just reminding you of its power. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with great carbonization. The flavors in this beer are delicate yet at the same time there is something powerful and devilish about this beer. Its a real sexy flavor range but quite strong at the same time. It really feels like this beer lures you in to something sweet but packs a punch just as you start to relax. The aftertaste is a perfect reminder of you last sip, tasting of citrus rine and spices with hints of bitterness.  This beer is one of the best Ive tried. Its a real trip and every sip packs a seductive punch. I will have a six pack of these in my cellar always.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Hibernator,4.4,"Duvel Served in an Allagash Belgian tulip glass Bottle Conditioned Best before date labeled for 10 2008  * Thanksgiving 2005 *  Pours a hazy golden yellow with a bunch of tiny carbonation bubbles. Looks like a pilsner with champagne bubbles in a haze. The head on this beer is unreal; it looks like it has the consistency of shaving cream. I was expecting a big head for a bottle conditioned beer, but this Duvel is massive. The head is sudsy, fluffy and all over the glass. One of the most aggressive heads I have ever seen. Patterns of sticky lace decorate the glass.  Whiffs of Belgian yeast....a blend of spices and light fruits.  Spicy and fruity with pear flavors and white pepper. Very clean and light with a creamy quality on the palate. Distinctive Belgian yeast taste. This is such a great beer with complex flavors that make this an interesting beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,delicious,4.25,"Poured from a 330mL shorty into a dedicated Duvel glass.  Bubbles erupt like a volcano from the pit of the glass, erecting a scaffold of spongy head that is tenacious in its longevity. The bottle advises to Pour unhurriedly, and even while heeding this warning, the head soon reaches the top of the glass. The body is a golden yellow, made slightly cloudy by the yeast. As it is consumed, the bitter tasting head laces the glass like clinging stockings on a curvy, tulip shaped leg. The aroma is floral and bitter with a citric acid bite, and completely fills the nose as the glass is tilted for a sip. Some coriander is noticeable. The beer feels full in the mouth as flowery bitterness dances a stimulating and erotic tap-ensemble on the tongue. The bitterness is multi-faceted and complicated; it feels like much more then one glass is needed to fully understand it. This beer is visually fascinating and has a spectacularly complicated nose and flavor, but I'm just not sure if I LIKE it! Maybe I'm just not ready, or maybe I'm not in the proper mood. This beer will have to be revisited for further conclusions to be drawn.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,AltTrinker,3.86,"A shorty 330ml freshness dated bottle poures a HUGE, solid foam head. Great care needs to be taken to slowly pour this beer so as to not over-develop the head. The head lasts forever, leaving lacy traces all over the glass with chunks of foam in the center of the beer. I chose to pour the yeast, giving a slightly turbid, pale golden color.  The nose initially gives a sharp, bitter aroma that mellows to a citrusy, lemon and corianter scent. The taste is more muted than the aroma with pale malty sweetness noted in the mouth, followed by hoppy bitterness down the throat that lingers on-and-on. The mouthfeel is light to moderate.  This is an eminently drinkable beer, especially to perk-up the taste buds before the evening meal. The 8.5% alcohol is well hidden in this smooth, very drinkable ale.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,LesStewart,3.83,"Great though I don't know if it's worth the difference in price that it often manifests.

The head is a thick creamy white cloud that turns rocky after the beer sits for a bit. This beer has nice Belgian lace throughout the drink.  S- The smell of perfume and light yeast and hints of pears and pepper are noted in the background.  T- Soft fruity notes are blended with a hint of spice and sourness. The fruit has qualities of pears, oranges with a slight buttery corn hint but it is very light. This finish has a nice hop bitterness that mixes with the spiciness of the beer.  M- Light mouthfeel with a hint of fizz in the texture. No astringency or alcohol warmth.  D- This beer is truly light and it does have some nice complexity in flavor. The buttery corn notes as it warmed seem to interfere with the other flavors but not a great deal. The head is simply incredible and the lace just last and last.

The head slowly fades, leaving a nice lace on the sides of the glass.  Smell: the aroma is of yeast, grass, and citrus.  Taste: the yeast is very prominent on the tongue, along with a pepper spiciness, citrus, decent malt levels, and crisp bitterness. Alcohol is slightly noticable.  Mouthfeel: super crisp at the start and finish, and the finish is slightly dry. Medium bodied brew.  Drinkability: superb drinkability as this is one of the more refreshing Belgian beers on the market.

Smell: Rich and yeasty with mild scents of hay and alfalfa. Mildly sweet and refreshing.  Taste: Mellow immediately with tastes of the aforementioned yeast. Moments later hints of pepper and medium hoppy bitterness present themselves. Mild undertones of an undetermined sweet fruit. Perhaps banana?  Mouthfeel: Strong and immediate, the flavors fill the mouth and the strong carbonation makes the front of the tounge tingle.  Drinkability: I find this to be more of a sipper than a slugger, due in fact to the strength of the brew and the delicate nature overall. More of a ""treat"" beer for me.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Golden2wenty1,4.13,"Picked up a single at some liquor store in Milwaukee on Oakland across from the Miramar Theater.  Pours a golden yellow/light amber, clear, with ample snow-white creamy head fed by a steady stream of bubbles from my chalice. Nose is musty/yeasty up front, with citrus, apricot, pineapple, and a slight hint of alarming vinegar in the end. Taste starts off similarly with tropical fruits, yeast, some grainy/grassy notes, and again, the slightest bit of puckering vinegar. Mouthfeel is typical Belgian pale - light, dry and bubbly. This was a tasty BSPA, but I've certainly had better. That vingar sourness just through me off a little. I tend to like my BSPAs a little sweeter. Still a good example of the style though.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

It is very satifying as a sipping beer to gain the flavors.  -=[Drinkability]=- I wanted a while on this one.

Served in champagne flutes after being left out for an hour. Unbelieveable frothy white head piling out of the glass. Quite difficult getting it under control. Nice straw color, quite carbonated, a bit hazy.  Smells of spice, cloves, corriander, some bananas, apples, pears. Just a tiny bit of citrus and grass.  Taste is mostly palate scrubbing bubbles, so it's almost an absence of taste. A little fruit manages to hit the tounge, but mostly spice and carbonation burning/lifting. The fruit doesn't last, but a dry aftertaste lingers.  Mouthfeel is carbonated, as mentioned! Medium body.  Highly drinkable, alcohol not noticeable at all.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,mattdavis452,4.67,"Poured from a bottle into an oversized wine glass. Head builds much more rapidly than most other beers, albeit a very fine, frothy head. There's a reason the bottle says ""Pour unaggressively.""  Smells slightly fruity, not so much of a citrus smell, but other fruit-like sensations are present.  The taste confirms the smell portion; mild to medium notes of fruitiness, but well balanced and exquisitely enjoyable. Crisp mouthfeel that leaves you wanting more, however, too much is not recommended due to the 8.5% alc./vol.  Drinkability is excellent. Indeed, I find myself agreeing with another quip found on the side of the bottle: ""Enjoy with discerning friends or good looking strangers.""",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,TurdFurgison,3.93,"Poured from a bottle into a scoopy-shaped chalice (Delirium Tremens chalice).  I can't really add anything new to the description of this famous beer that hasn't already been said. My take on it is that the appearance is awesome, mostly due to the clumpy sticky head which never dissipates. The taste is good, but not strong. I think I prefer more robust flavor than this offers. But the drinkability is high because nothing slows you down (goes down easy).",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,alysmith4,4.06,"The duvel is definitely in the details. Upon close examination, one can see a steady stream of tiny bubble spirits rising from the underworld of the glass. The smell is of fire-roasted banana, with a pinch of satan-chewed bubble gum. The taste is very smooth, and the flavors come together as it warms in the demonic inferno. Enjoy it on judgement day, but be sure to pour and drink slowly so not to open up the firey gates of hell!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,crwills,4.23,"My first BA review! So, I figured I'd start with something easy and well known.  Reviewing my fourth of four bottles of Duvel in the last couple of weeks. Poured into an oversized wine glass, a very cloudy amber colour with a massive head, which leaves sticky residue on the glass when faded.  Smell is citrus fruit (oranges?) and spice, with a hint of grass.  I started the evening with a Brasserie RJ Ambree Speciale (also a Belgian pale ale), and it's incredible how different the mouthfeel of the Duvel is. Smooth, sticky, and doesn't remotely taste like 8.5%. A little more carbonation than I like (being a beer newby I'm still into the heavy stouts), but very drinkable.  Taste is citrus and pine, with a moderate sourness and a pleasantly bitter, hoppy aftertaste -- and maybe sour apples.  Overall, a great beer, and dangerously drinkable for the ABV. I will definitely be picking up more the next time I'm at a decent LCBO!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,sinistrsam,4.45,"It was good to see that the establishment that offered this Belgian used the Duvel snifter-style tulip glass. The head was among the most impressive I have seen and smelled on a Belgian; large, white, and with hints of sweet fruits, citrus, bananas, yeasts and candy sugar. The taste was excellent, creamy and yeasty finishing dry and smooth. There was continuous carbonation, but enough to completely distract from the flavor. One of my favorite Belgians and a must-try for any beer drinker.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,rhythmpirate,4.08,"Appearance: This truly is a great looking beer; bubbling golden base with a massive puffy white head. Once the head finally subsides it looks like sculpted rock almost. The lacing is immense, with bubbles on the inside of the glass all the way down a good 10 minutes after finishing my glass.  Smell: A very fruity smell, hints of apples and grass, with underlaying elements of yeast. Also a slight hint of perfume and spices underneath it all.  Taste: Upon taking the inital sip you get a quick bite of a malty flavour. Then once you've swallowed it down, a distinct after-taste comes along. The after-taste is slightly bitter, but also very satisfying and more-ish.  Mouthfeel: Very carbonated, much more so than I was expecting. Its a little bit too fizzy for my tastes, but that doesn't spoil the fact this is an incredible beer.

Malty in the taste, fruits and a candy sweetness  a small kick of the Belgium yeast taste.  The disappointing: wow, what a highly carbonated brew, almost champaign in the fizziness.

I finally worked my way through the entire World Beer section at the local megamart here in Incheon and I've been saving this for last as motivation to get me through the Korean and American macros. It's the most expensive individual beer in the store but I've got a feeling it's worth it, I've heard a lot of positive reviews of this beer. Pours a pleasant cloudy golden color with a solid, lasting puffy, foamy,head. I smell fresh citrus, herbs and alcohol, strangely reminiscent of champagne. Mouthfeel is crisp and satisying but a little heavier than I expected. The taste is dry and not as flavorful as i expected except for the alcohol, which is pronounced. This is a good beer but not exactly to my taste. The alcohol is a bit higher than I generally prefer to taste, although it's still a quality bevo.

Tremendous, frothy-white head, as was certainly expected, (poured into a proper Duvel glass, I was pre-warned).  Mild flowery/malty nose, reminds me of some Euro pilsners I have had, (maybe a little like a fresh draft Bitburger).  First pour. Fresh, crisp bite up front. Slight warming from the ABV, yet does not affect drinkability at all. Mild citrus with some spice highlights. Some yeast and grass, too. Nice creamy texture from occasional bits of head in some sips.  Second pour. Slight haziness I didn't notice the first time. Peppery finish becoming evident. Light on the palate, but still plenty of flavors to enjoy and savor. More spices coming through as it warms. One to savor, no doubt.  Mouthfeel is outstanding. Light but complete and not watery, love the creamy head.  Drinkability is deceptive. I have heard there is a reason they call this one ""Devil"", it would be too easy to drink a few of these down quickly on a hot day. At this ABV, that could be trouble...

This beer as a spicy aroma. I detect pepper, cloves, and a slightly malty sweet aroma. I detect very little in the way of hops. This beer has a strong spicy flavor. It has a sweet malty taste also. It is slightly hoppy. The 8.5% alcohol is hidden very well in the flavor. This beer is crisp and smooth. It might be just a little overcarbonated, but not so much that it detracts form the flavor. This beer leaves a spicy aftertaste. I think that this beer might make a decent session beer, but with an ABV of 8.5%, you might have a little trouble drinking it all night. Ultimately, I think this beer was great. Try it if you see it.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,evh883,4.03,"Belgian is my favorite nationality of beer and this was definetely one I can put high in the rankings. As soon as it comes out of the bottle you know you have something special. A massive, everlasting, frothy head looms up over the sparkling, hazy yellow beer and leaves behind very heavy lacing on the glass.  The aroma is very malty with a pleasant smell of hay. The yeast aroma is the most dominant though with notes of leather and sweat (doesn't sound to appetizing but in this case it's great!).  An tongue pleasing sweetness caries from beginning to end and complinments the excellent mouthfeel. A nice fizziness with a hint of astringency show up here.  Overall, you must try this beer no matter what your preference. It truly is an excellent beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Naes,3.89,"Golden in color and a bit cloudy. The head is enormous, frothy and white, which laces wonderfully. The aroma is a bit spicy and yeasty. Its flavor is malty with spice and a bit of alcohol showing through as well. However, I must add that this is a nicely blended beer, the alcohol is barely noticeable. Medium in body and highly carbonated. This beer goes down quite easy for such a high ABV, so beware.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,twelvsies,3.34,"Had this beer awhile ago, and wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be, given the hype. Decided to give it another go and get pretty much the same results. It is one of the most visually pleasing beer I've ever had, I'll give it that. Big mountainous head, milky white, piling out of the top of my glass. Smell and taste are sugary sweet, with traces or Belgian spices and spicy herbal hops. Taste is nice, but there's a strong alcohol kick to it that doesn't seem to belong in this beer, and I have no beef in general with a little alcohol kick. And maybe a little overly sweet. Basically I'm pretty underwhelmed with this beer. Maybe if I'd had lower expectations I would've liked it more, but it still seems like an average Belgian ale to me.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,PisoMojado,4.28,This beer must be served in its appropriate glass. Tilt glass and pour slowly. A thick head will form and stick to the glass as the beer is slowly consumed. Duvel has a light golden color with a spicy scent. This beer goes down smooth and the spiciness almost tickles the throat. Duvel is an enjoyable beer. Its light and somewhat hoppy character mask the bold 8.5% abv. A trip to Moortgat brewery is impressive and educational. Only 20% of the brewery's production is exported. The rest stays in Belgium.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,revdrjbob,3.61,"This has to be one of my favourite Belgian ales, a superb beer looks great, drinks well. Thanks to peorgarmpe.  Poured into a Maudite goblet, half filling the glass, high white head a pale yellow gold hard working beer. The bubbles work hard like champagne, the head sits so hugely that it's a shame to break through it to drink...  Couldn't really smell anything until I got rid of some of that tasty head. Smelt of malt, yeast, spices, alcohol. Aromas of spicey Saaz(?) hops, intoxicating.  Tastes awesome, I remember the first time I had this, I thought I'd died and gone to Valhalla. Complex flavours of spices, malt, ripe pears and fruits, giving way to an easy bitterness. The alcohol comes through nicely, though the body is still that of a lower abv beer. Perfect. The finish is long, gets drier the more I drink. I top up my glass, watching the head grow again. It's almost pornographic.  Deceptively strong, not a big quaffer, but I'd like to give it a burl.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

The head will lessen but stick around and lace the glass with white frothy bubbles. The smell is light and spicy with a hint of alcohol. The taste is nice smooth, crisp and carbonated. You hardly notice the alcohol, but it warms the body. Head still existent throughout. A drinkable beer indeed.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

A - Pours a thin, light golden color, a little hazy with a head that kept on growing, I left it for a minute and it almost cascaded over the glass. The lacing on this is also more than I've ever seen, for people who like head, divulge in this!  S - Hmm, the head was so big I couldn't smell much, and even with the head gone, I couldn't get a lot of aroma either, but I do have a foamy mustache, yay!  T - A very sharp, crisp taste. Gives merit to the pilsner malts, didn't notice much in the hops or the alcohol, this is a great tasting brew.  M - Very light on the mouth, a nice bubbly texture, the old line ""There's a party in my mouth and everyone's invited!""  D - Awesome, awesome drinkability. Really the only downside is the high ABV, that you can't taste, so you might buy a sixer of this and take down a few and it will hit you hard.  I thought I'd like this beer, but I am really enjoying it, it really suprises me how good this is.

Taste is of spicy orange peel, and black pepper mixed in a pilsner brew with definite Belgian yeast being implimented. Mouthfeel is slightly harsher than smooth with a slight sweetness, bitterness, and just a touch of off skunkiness that's hard to place. Drinkability is ok.

222,695,FenwaySquid,5,"Presentation: 330ml bottle (BBD January, 2008) poured into a proper Duvel tulip glass.  Appearance: Poured a bright golden color (deceiving if you know nothing of Belgian ales) with a head that took up about half of the glass. Both the color and head are exquisite.  Aroma: Pepper, some spiciness and malt as well.  Taste: Crisp and refreshing, a clean malt flavor is present throughout. You get a little bit of the alcohol in the finish, but for a 8.5% ABV beer it certaintly goes down easy.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy, the carbonation is also excellent.  Overall: This beer is perfection in a bottle; one of, if not the best that I have ever tasted.

The white creamy foam has endurance and that cool topography of a Belgian ale.  The aroma is sweet and flowery with a finishing curl of sourness. Apples, malt, and wild fermentation. Lovely without overdoing any of the constituents - a shortcoming among most new world attempts.  The taste is bright and crisp with barley and cider flavors, tart with yeast remnants and just a final bit of dry breadiness. There's no excess of sugar in the body which makes it a warming, filling beer without the young sweet affects. Really quite excellent.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

I poured it into a snifter glass.  The beer itself poured a beautiful gold with a 1+ in. white, frothy head. The head retained incredibly well; it stayed as I drank the beer down and left thin, semi-sticky lacing. The beer smelled wonderful: malts and a grassy sweetness. This beer tasted and drank so well. Crisp. Clean. Flavorful and direct but eluding with a medium body. The 8.5% alcohol was not evident or overpowering in the taste. The beer got better as it warmed... I wish I had bought a few more of these. It's insanely drinkable. A simply great beer. I will be coming back to this one.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Feeling really blothed may have something to do with the scoring. I had to go with the 750ml due to the price. If you over do it when pouring you can enjoy the fluffy head. This brings a new meaning to head texture. The Golden Ale has earned it's name by matching the color to the style. It's different when all of the ales I have had consumed are darker. I like the smell really well but when tasting, throws me the other way. I can really taste the increase in alcohol in it.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

The nose picks up yeasty bread aromas right away with some cidery fruits at the end. The taste is beautifully malty with an estery sweetness and a spicy hop kick; the alcohol warmly creeps up as this hits my throat. There's some mild apple candy business going on, too.

There are sweet notes of wheat, fruit candy, and a mild bitterness. The aftertaste got flavours of wheat dough, alcohol and some bitter hops.

Aroma has citrusy and spicy hop notes with a fruity ale yeast and biscuit like malt background...certainly appealing. Flavor begins with a crisp hops profile of citrus, spices, and minerals followed by a distinct malt profile of biscuit and dry toasted bread flavors, then a background of fruity ale yeast. Intriguing and original, really a combination of a pilsner and a blegian pale.

Aroma is distinctly fruits - plums, green banana, some spice and some leafy hops. A whiff or two of alcohol in the back. Intriguing and beckoning...  The taste is slightly sweet almos candy sugar, some spicy, leafy, hops, a strong presence of alcohol and more fruit and spice. A complex and tasty brew.

222,695,asabreed,4.67,"33 cl. bottle, purchased and enjoyed with mustard crusted rabbit at Can Can in Richmond. I figured there was no better time to try it.  Appearance: Huge head that slowly dissipates at a crawling pace down the glass. It wasn't going anywhere. Nice champagne-like color, though this was a pretty gorgeous lemon yellow color with tons of bubbles climbing their way up.  Smell: It was nice to have this chilled and keep getting my nose in the glass as it warmed. The alcohol is present, but it melds perfectly with the banana and candi sugar aromas. Some citrus, yeasty bread. Some pepper, spice, and lemon peel. I suppose this is what a Belgian Strong Pale Ale should smell like, but this is one of the best aromas I've ever gotten from the style, from chilled to room temperature.  Taste: Does justice to the aromas for sure. Sweetness is balanced with the yeasty flavors, and a slight hop bitterness at the end. Banana, alchol, and candi sugar are at the forefront, but there's certainly a near-perfect balance going on.  Mouthfeel: What I was hoping for with the taste and aromas. Light to medium body, perfect carbonation. I don't think this could be better.  Drinkability: Duvel's fairly expensive, yes, but it's definitely worth it. I think rather than a corked and caged, I'd know prefer the 4-packs, which I certainly will make a staple since I know I can get them around here.  This is an all around exceptional example of the style, and surely one of the best. I'd recommend, if you haven't had many, trying some from some other breweries, then trying Duvel to see what you think. Either way, it's a great beer, and one worthy of celebration.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,SkeeterHawk,4.38,"Appearance: Almost completely clear yellow straw color at first pour. The beer had a huge thick head on it made up of mostly large bubbles. Now this is what I would call mousy. Drinking the beer left a thick Belgian lace on the glass. After quite a few minutes, there was still a very prominent head being held together by a bunch of bubbles rising.  Aroma: Through the foam I get a good bit of citrus in the nose. There is so much going on in the aroma, but the hops are there to add to the complexity. As it warms a bit, I notice a faint banana in the background. The Pilsner malt is also becoming a much larger part of the aroma profile as it sits a bit.  Taste: This is a really clean beer that is medium bodied...however you can't even tell from the generous carbonation. The flavor is as complex as the aroma. There is a lot of malt presence for a beer this light. You can pick out some really subtle spiciness from the Hops, but this really blends well with the whole tasting experience. As it warms up, I am getting a lot more spice that is deeper than just the hops. It is gaining a very slight peppery note. This is probably about the only thing that is noticeable from the alcohol. Other than this, I wouldn't think that this beer had 8.5% ABV at all.  Opinion: Of course you know that I am of the opinion that this is an incredible beer! It is light, and very well balanced. The mix of subtle flavors masks the bite that this beer packs. After finishing this 750mL bottle myself, I am feeling a bit warmer. I highly recommend this beer!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,andjusticeforale,4.6,"I've had this several times but thought that last night was a good time for a review. I poured a cold bottle into a tulip glass anddid it real slow to achieve some clarity.  It is a pretty beer. Perfectly golden with a faint orangey hue, a big, pillowy, bitter, yeasty head that is most similar to whipped cream. Fantastic carbonation. Perfect amount.  The nose on this beer is complex and sweet and it makes you want to swirl it and smell it over and over before each sip.  Upon first sip there is a cold deep sweetness, balanced absolutely perfectly by a hoppy bitterness; they both must be there and coexist, they make the beer refreshing, they cover the strong alcohol, and provide a wonderful aftertaste. As you progress with the glass, the flavor becomes a bit maltier with some citrus and fruit. The bitterness eases up.  Two final thoughts. First: I have heard that beer is linked to simplicity. In that respect, this beer is as complex as anyone would ever need- and there is no sense drinking black glasses full of swamp mud and coffee grounds to have a ""superior feeling"" about your beer. This is as good as it gets.  Secondly: I was at a homebrewing store and talking to a frequent Belgian traveler who said Belgians, and Duvel don't travel well; it was a much better beer in Belgium.

Sweet candied malt character. A wonderfully balanced peppered spice that gives the sugary sweetness a nice kick. A touch of earthiness and hints of citric fruit; lemon and orange peel.

Taste is biting hops, coriander and cool, sweet malt with a big warming alcohol in the gullet. Bitter, spicy finish. Addictive. Spiceness increases as it warms.

222,695,Zraly,4.43,"Poured from a 750 ml. Light, golden hue topped with a soft, pillow-like, white head that clings dearly to the side of my glass. It appears to be soft and delicate. An eye catcher to the female eyes.  The delicacy pours over into the subtle nature of the general smells: alcohol, bread, and a nice hint of noble hops.  The flavor is absolutely divine. Smooth to the bone. Light and bubbley on the tongue, but full of rich, fruitiness that rounds out on the palate. There is a fun snap that lingers, somewhat lemony in quality. Mild, phenolic afterglow keeps things on the clovey-spicey-warm end of things, and reminds you that you are drinking a heavier, belgian ale. Because the truth is that this lil' devil will sneak up on you and knock you onto your pushin' cushion in terms of alcohol. The alcohol is more than appropriate for this paradoxical, little number.  You could easily pair this number with a variety of foods. A nice veal francese wouldn't hurt.

This is a very fine beer, indeed. Pours to a clear golden yellow pilsener color with a very lively carbonation, particularly from the etching in the bottom of my Duvel tulip. This is an extremely heady beer. As it is tipped back, the four finger head forms a marshmallow mountain in the center of the tulip. It truly is a sight to behold, as it the abundant pillowy lacing.  The smell is very bready and yeasty, paired with a generous serving of clove notes. The pilsener malts provide a distinct pils character, but it is much more exotic than that. Also quite sweet from candi-sugar, but not disgustingly so like many strong belgian beers. Underlying all of this is also a sweet berry flavor. It's quite good, especially when it warms up a bit.  The taste is very delicious. It's like a pils, but not bland and skunky/saazy. Despite the alcohol content, it is just as refreshing as a good pilsener as well. The taste profile matches up quite well with the aroma.  The mouthfeel is quite light and refreshingly swillable (though this is quite far from swill). The finish manages to stay quite moist with a small otherwise un-noticeable alcohol burn coating the mouth. Despite the high proof, this is beer is damn drinkable.

222,695,JohnfromDublin,4.03,"Tasted on 12th June 2005, bottle best by end 03.2008. Poured into my Duvel glass. As a previous reviewer stated, it's hard to control the pour. Massive head formation, white foam on a straw/golden colour with a slight haze.  The first smell is faint, probably due to the head, slight hops, bitter honey maybe some ginger.  Taste very good, not sweet, mild alcohol fruit changing to some bitterness. Silky smooth mouthfeel. A very well rounded beer; it's the full monty start to finish. Head returns with a swirl of the glass.  Footnote: I measured the Duvel glass tulip afterwards and the volume is 600ml (20 fl. ozs). Even with my bottle being 330ml, the massive foam head easily fills the space. I don't know how the glass was designed, but it is a perfect accessory to the beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,OatherS,3.52,"The short stubby bottle has a white label with a nice crested bottle cap.  Appearance: Poured just a tad too quickly and the head is MASSIVE. Effervescent, champagne like quality. The head is very slow to fade. Laces nicely. Very transparent golden color. Awesome.  Smell: Not very strong aroma. Somewhat of a fruity odor, with a slight alcohol smell as well.  Taste: Very nice smooth almost liquor type flavor. The strong alcohol percentange taste is there but it is not over powering.  Mouthfeel: Not quite as bubbly as I thought from the head and bubbly appearance. Nice and smooth.  Drinkability: Definitely a sipping beer, drink this one slowly.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,BEERchitect,4.58,"Everytime I open a bottle I am always asking, ""Now why is this not the best beer in the world?"" There are few beers that single-handedly define the style ideally. Duvel does it as well as any other beer.  A careful pour is needed as the beer's head fills the chalice at about twice the pace of the liquid itself. Medium straw and with brilliant clarity. The carbonation contiunes to build a head that is shows great stability, longevity and airiness. The beer leaves impressive lacing thoughout the session.  Moderate, yet complex aromas of fruity pears along with sharp acrid scents of under-rippened berries and apples. Softer pilsner malts soon find the olfactories, giving a firm malty base for the esters, acidity, and spices. Noble hops give a perfume and lemongrass note that again gives complexity while balancing the malts. Spiced with subtle white pepper and zesty alcohols, this beer takes on a ligtly vineous, berry-like, citrusy, lightly tart taste. Again the hop flavor perplexes the taste with a light earthiness that complements the fruits with vibrant lemmon counterparts.  The beer is as dry in the body as a beer can be without getting chalky or powdery. Acidity cleanses the palate very well. The beer expands wonderfully in the mouth with its abundance of controlled carbonation, yet evaporates with a cotton-candy like whimsy. Alcohols accentuate the carbonation and accompany the spiciness into the finish. Effortless to drink and dangerously smooth.  The beer is basically ideal!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Frozensoul327,5,"From the 750ml bottle. Even better than the 4 packs. What can I say? This is the ultimate of beers. Poured out to an amazing clear and beautiful golden color with a white cloud like foamy head. Dream like aroma of sweet spice and crisp herbs. The taste is heavenly, with the carbonation demanding attention from your tastebuds to savor every drop of this brew. Flavors of citrus, sweetness and bitterness were most noted, but this beer is almost beyond words. Finished crisp and clean, like it was daring me to not take the glass from my lips. The ulitimate beer in my opinion. Well worth the price tag of the big bottle. Highly recommended. This is the end all be all of world class beers in my opinion. The only brew that has every earned all 5's in my reviews. This is beer from Heaven. Grace be to GOD, this brew is the ultimate.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,allengarvin,4.65,"750ml bottle, poured into a Duvel chalice glass. Pours a light, pale, and slightly hazy yellow-gold, crowned with a huge supporting head of foam. Nose is spicy, even peppery, with lots of phenols, accompanied by a floral and fruity scent. First taste is dry and citrusy, reminiscent of lemongrass, or perhaps curacao orange peel. Fruity and floral, like apple blossoms, light and delicate. Finally, it finishes dry, lingering for long moments. Body is very light for the strength, deceptively so. The mouthfeel and texture is very effervescent.  I've reviewed nearly 300 beers, but somehow I'd not gotten Duvel, despite it being a favorite I drink 2 or 3 times a month. One of my favorite beers of all time, light, easy to drink, but with a substantial punch. A classic and a style unto itself, without equal.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Aroma is nice light fruity, apple and banana most noticable on top of nice bready malt. Light spicey pepper and grassy hops sneaking into the mix also.Very nice and inviting.  Taste is where it falls short. Kind of, the overpowering carbonation that distracts from the wonderful flavors reminds me of Corsendonk's Brown Ale, not quite as bad though. Taste coming thru the fizz is nice bready malt, fruit banana's dominating again, finishes with light pepper and grassy hops. Will admit by the time I finished the last of the 750ml the carbonation had almost died down to acceptable levels. Don't think a beer should have to sit for an hour to breath though.  Mouthfeel is light and crisp but thecarbonation makes it less the good not bad really but definatly not good.

Rocky pure white head plumes above the glass and taunts me. As I sip, sticky pactches of foamy lace are left behind. Floral aroma greets my eager nostrils and fills them fresh cut apples, herbs, bitter lemons, some grass, and a little brash alcohol. Taste begins deceptively mellow - one sly devil of a brew. Smooth bready malts take the lead before being outshined by strong spices and some herbs. Yeast is noticeable and transitions into clovey bananas before giving up to warming alcohol. Finish is bitter lemons with some alcohol and a slightly drying acidity. Crisp, clean mouthfeel compliments the complex flavor.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

The head is smooth and sandy looking. The beer is well carbonated and looks very nice with all of the bubbles coming up from the ""D"" engraved in the center of the glass.  Smell: The aroma is very pleasant with a very fruity base to it. There's some green apple and a sweet, straw scent.  Taste: Big malt flavor up front with seemingly creamy fruit flavors. Apple, pear, vanilla, and a spicy/peppery end. There is a floral flavor mixed up in the bready and pasty ending. Some light hop flavor near the end.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth and light. It has a clean and dry feel in the mouth. Very pleasant.  Drinkability: This is an excellent beer all around. It's nice that such a great beer is so readily available, too.

222,695,bultrey,4.71,"Wow... I haven't reviewed a beer in a while, but after revisiting this old standby, I realized I had never reviewed it... and needed to.  This is an exceptional beer -- perhaps one of the most balanced and smooth Belgian strong pale ales ever created. The appearance out of the bottle is amazing -- no matter how careful you are, this produces a pillowy, meringue-like white head on top of a relatively pale yellow liquid with lively carbonation. The effect is intensified if you pour it into a tulip glass. The smell is very yeasty and doughy, with hints of orange and coriander. What an astounding taste. Sweet biscuity flavors up front, followed immediately by mango, pineapple, pear, and an extremely dry cidery finish that carries with it a long, lingering spiciness that is reminiscent of white pepper, coriander, and lemongrass. The crisp finish makes this a natural match for many foods, but particularly spicy foods such as Indian, Thai, or Middle Eastern. The mouthfeel is smooth, with lively carbonation. Drinkability is off the charts, and the relatively high alcohol percentage is oh-so-very well hidden. One of the classics.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Lnedrive14,3.95,"I had read the reviews on here but I was still a bit shocked by the head. Although i poured as per the directions on the bottle, I still had to wait a while to drink anything but foam. After the pour, you can see bubbles frenetically racing through the beer, which is a light blonde in color. Aside from the head, the beer actual looks too much like a light beer.  But the taste is anything but light. Instantly you feel the warming presence of 8.5% alcohol. The flavor manages to be strong yet easily drinkable. Lots of fruit flavors throughout the tasting process. Initially I tasted the apple flavors, but the banana had the more lasting impression.  After the rave reviews I was expecting a lot from this beer. For a pale ale, I suppose it was decently complex, but I guess I was just expecting more. It is quite refreshing and would be great on a hot day.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Boilermaker88,4.92,"Ah, Duvel. I hadn't had a Duvel in quite a while but last night seemed like a good time to get re-acquainted. Poured from a stubby 11.2 oz. bottle into a tulip glass, Duvel had a lightly hazed golden color topped by a massively pillowy white head. Looked like merangue and stuck to the glass like glue. Carbonation kept churning up from the bottom of the glass, stoking the head constantly. The nose had a fruity sweetness and nice spicey bite. Caught a few whiffs of wheat, faint banana, and apple skins. Noticeable alcohol fumes waft from the glass but aren't a detractor. Rather, they blend in quite well and accentuate the other aromas. A couple good pulls and I caught the exceptional balance Duvel possesses. Nice maltiness up front, more hints of apples and tart green grapes, and a pleasing peppery hops flavor that compliments the sweetness. At the back of the tongue I picked up the taste of wheat. Oh yeah, there was an omnipresent alcohol bite. The feel was light, lush, and velvety. Duvel remains one of my favorite beers. The beer's character and seamless integration of flavors makes it the defining example of the style, IMO.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

This beer finishes sweet and mildly Belgian style yeasty, which is a good thing. One of the best tasting beers in the world, overall very drinkable and very good.  Lighter to medium bodied with a noticable alcohol character that does not really dominate or detract from the fruity and amazing flavors.

222,695,MattBrooks,4.33,"Duvel, as most everyone on this site knows is one of the best Belgian Ales around. At 8.5% alc. it can really pack a punch, but try serving it instead of wine (it does come in a 750ml bottle) at your next dinner party and you may just be surprised at the reaction you get.

Frothy lacing effects. I kid you not, as the head settled it formed a rosette on the surface of the beer. The bottle mentions almost off-handedly ""Pour unhurriedly"". Take their advice!  Aroma: Subtle. Notes of alcohol (almost whisky-like) and light hops. Candi sugar and clean, citrusy malt.  Taste: Sweet as it hits the tongue, then warming as the alcohol finds the back of the palate. Dry in character. Definitely a keeper.  Light mouthfeel. This would make a lovely apertif at the end of a good meal. Belgians - they are masters!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Spicy fruit scents in the nose, lots of yeast and spice, maybe some peppery alcohol.  Taste: Crisp malt taste with lots of alcohol and a little bit of an apple and other fruit flavors in there. There's some pepper and spice that comes through with the big alcohol, but overall it's a pretty easier drinker for its heft.

222,695,GCBrewingCo,4.16,"The beer poured into the tulip crystal clear pale goldne with a white everlasting frothy head which fell slowly to lace the glass.  The aroma was strongy estery with an alcohol spice phenolic. The aroma had an apple peel character followed behind by a light caramel maltiness. The aroma was also floral  The flavor was crisp and highly carbonated with a light malty presence that was accentuated by more floral, fruity and apple flavors. The bittering component kept the malt presence in check. Speaking of Czech, this beer has a strange similarily to a Bohemian Pilsner. The main disparity between the two is fruitiness.  The finish was dry with lasting bittering and crisp fruitiness long into the aftertaste. The body was medium light to medium and very highly carbonated. The alcohol was present in the aroma causing some spicy phenolics, not present as all in the flavor, back again at the finish, and reared it's head one last time in the warming sensation after consumption.   11.2 ounce bottle. Best berfore 10 2007 on bottle. Purchased at Green's in Atlanta, GA. Served at home in a Duvel glass...how appropriate. The first time I had this beer I dubbed it ""headache in a bottle"".

Fruity and spicy aroma. Floral hops mingle with a peppery character. Very light sweetness mixes nicely with fruitiness.  Starts with a creamy sweetness mixed with light fruit (apple?) flavour. This changes to a pleasant spiciness with some additional sweetness. Mostly phenols and a bit of peppery bite. The finish is very smooth warm alcohol that ends on the dry side and allows a bit of the hop bitterness to peek through. Bitterness is restrained overall, but provides adequate balance. Quite a delicate flavour overall with no one aspect overpowering anything else. Very nicely balanced. The carbonation is on the high side, but doesn't interfere at all with the creamy texture at any point. Medium/light body.

It has that pilsner aroma that reminds me of a less fortunate beer. Not really a whole lot going on in the scent.  The taste is super light and crisp. Not an extremely bold flavor, but it tastes great. Spices and pilsner malts with an ever so modest hop character to round out the whole affair. This is like a heavyweight ABV light beer. Very strange and wonderful. You could guzzle these down and be caught totally unaware by the alcohol which remains completely undetectable in taste or smell. Very excellent choice for warmer weather, when a refreshing and high powered beverage is called for. This sucker is a very good beer. It deserves the adoration that so many seem to have for it.

Pours like the picture, the hazy orange hue with a pile of marangue like head. The head grows for a while after pouring, then starts to fade while leaving thick lacing everywhere.  Smell is nice, but I've smelled better from belgian beers. Perhaps Duvel's weak point, there isn't as much aroma as one would expect from such a flavourful brew.  Duvel's taste is great, from sweet to dry with a hint of bitter. Sugar and wine type flavours, pepper and spice, all layered on top of a hint of citrus.  Duvel's mouthfeel is what I use to judge beers of this style. There is a bit of weight to is and the carbonation is just right. Enough that you feel it, but it is not an irritant.

Oh yeah, alcohol is pretty present, as well.  mouthfeel is spritzy, lots of carbonation, pretty nice. feels like the beer is whole in your mouth, as in, beer with a good sized head. id' imagine this is probably the case. drinkability is good, though, it's going to take some time to polish off 750 ml.

It really is a thing of beauty. The beer has a pale lemony straw cast to it, and a little tornado of carbonation swirling in the center. The head lasts forever, yielding a rocky, clumpy lace. The smell of pine and pears at first. Hint of grapefruit and granny smith apples. A whiff of alcohol. The first taste is apples and oranges, herbal bitterness, and subtle malt in the center. The citric fruit and gentle bitter hops are hand in hand throughout. It has a bitter but fruity finish. I'm not sure how that happens, but that's the only way I can describe it.

I wasn't wowed by Rare Vos either which is very similar to this but findable for about half the price. Extremely drinkable at 8.5%... vitually undetectable. Very mild in taste.

A wonderful spiced belgian ale, pears are the fruit notes in this one. This is the 'Belgian Strong Golden'. The carbonation in this brew helps enhance the dry finish.

Overall impressions: This is a thing of beauty in all aspects. Next time you see it pick up the four pack with the tulip glass - it makes for an amazing presentation. This beer is incredibly drinkable, yet complex at the same time. One of my favorite beers to date.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,NiceGuyMike,4.87,"What can be said about a near perfect beer? Near Perfect for starters. I enjoyed this feast of brew while eating some Latin food. A great pairing.  Appearence: good, beautiful golden yellow. A bit cloudy though Smell: nice and fruity with a bit of yest. Taste: a wonderfully creamy belgian flavor. More to come on this. Mouthfeel: normally I don't put much stock in this, but it had a nice creamy champagne feel. Drinkability: all day. A bit potent, but very drinkable.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,karst,4.88,"Ordered from a local english/american pub/resturant in Rolla, Mo. I asked to open and pour the beer. The going on 40ish gal behind the bar removed the cap and sat the unpoured bottle beside a Duvel glass and bluntly stated: ""you can't take the bottle from the premises"" and ignored me not offering a menu or any further service.  Looking for a special brew for the 100th review I was looking forward to a great experience, so much for the atmosphere. Pouring the beer a perfect head formed while the obnoxious person behind the bar complained about the music and swore. A great nose arose that could only have came from Belgium. I knew its taste would peak my appetite and when a male owner/cook came to the bar I thought I would be offered a menue. At least no one was smoking and I was going to appreciate the fine aroma. Looking around the bar I saw nothing to advertise the presence of this awsome tasting import only Budweiser, Millers, and Killians decorated my surroundings. A second waitress/owner sat at the bar and lit a cigarette. I warmed the Duval tulip glass with my hands trying to drive its temperature to a minumim of 40°F from the near 30° it was served at. Finally as the last few sip went down I obtained ideal temperature range. A constant fountain of beads eminating from the center of the stemed glass built a marshmallow sized island with a finger thick layer of foam around it. This head was so persistant that I considered asking for a doggie bottle to take it home. But feeling ignorned and unwanted I did not take a chance on the employees/owners having a sense of humor. Great beer.. wrong place to drink.  At last finishing an unending banter with another employee the waitress/barmaid returned taking the bottle and glass and asked for ""five dollars"" without a please or thankyou.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,MarkBlackout,4.31,"I love Duvel. It has a crisp, balanced character I don't find too often in Belgian beers. Its appearance is unparalleled.. the first time i properly poured one i was astounded (and still am every time!) This is an utterly sophisticated drink that could appeal even to those who don't drink beer. Highly reccomended: I'll leave detailed descriptions to those who are better at that sort of thing.  Also: I use my Duvel tulip religiously for a variety of beers. I got this 750ml on sale for $5.99 and it was a joy to employ the tulip for its intended brew!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,skybluewater,4.65,"Poured into a standard pint glass, because I don't have a tulip. Looks pale gold, and becomes cloudy when I pour the yeast. Huge, very strange head of very light foam (starting to see why the glass may be important) that leaves almost no lace. Smells of clove and bananas. Tastes of spicy clove, banana, and yeast. Be careful when drinking, because this is a pretty refreshing beer (especially on a warm summer's eve) where the ABV is barely noticible-this isn't called the Devil for nothing.  Despite the lack of a proper glass, I found this to be quite a good beer, although one that may take a bit of getting used to. I may re-review this one when I have that tulip. --- 3-6-2005:  Still don't have that tulip, but I decided to re-review this one. I'm glad I did. My palate has apparently grown up since I first reviewed Duvel, and I now consider it to be one of the best beers in the world. I still wish I had a tulip, but I don't think it matters, and it certainly didn't affect the taste of the beer, nor the drinkability. The aftertaste is a bit too dry for my liking, and the smell is a touch weak, but other than that, this is one good brew.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,vwahaszee,4.82,"When I poured this I thought I did a terrible job, and maybe I did, but the picture on the bottle shows a lot of head there as well, so I guess that's normal. As for the beer itself, it was about as smooth as anything 8% that I've had. Tastes a lot like Maredsous, another one I liked. The beer just kind of floated its way down into my stomach. I finished it without even noticing my progress, I think that says something about a beer. Oh yeah and I wasn't drunk either, so it must have been the Duvel.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,dren,3.81,"Watch out when you pour this baby...there is even a warning on the bottle. The head explodes into something similar to what the picture shows above. Very foamy and long lasting. I like a small creamy head and this just was a little too much, so the next few I poured with great care and very little head was produced.  A very vibrant golden color reminicent of...believe it or not...Schlitz. The smell and flavor are far from the Schlitz though. Fruity with a small touch of spice. Reminds me of apple juice. The beer goes down very smooth. Some say you can't tell that there is an alcohol content above 8% but I can taste it. The taste isn't biting like the taste you find with high gravity malt liquors though...more of an acidic apple juice flavor without the acid bite if that makes much sense?  I was expecting great things with this beer, but I didn't quite receive them. It is just a very good easy drinking beer, but not outstanding. Very well ballanced I might add too. I enjoyed it, but for the price, I wouldn't buy it again. Watch the alcohol content, it will sneek up on you.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,palma,4.68,"Yeah! now here's a REAL Belgian! There are many imitators out there, but there's nothing like the real thing. Light gold body looks much like champaign. Big airy white head. Smell is peppery spice with fruit notes, particularly apple. Tastes as you'd expect from the smell. Spicy, with many complex fruity notes. Light malt throughout. Mouthfeel is amazing. Looks so carbonated and harsh in the glass but man is it smooth! So unexpected. Not like champaign, this beer has tiny light smooth bubbles, and is not fizzy at all. It goes down so easy. Big time refreshment here. This 750 ml bottle is too damn small. 8.5 abv is hidden mad well so watch your back! Especially since this brew is so easy drinking.  Notes: make sure you consume out of the proper glass (oversized wine glass or tulip). It makes a shit load of a difference. Also, if you're in the beer store, try to pick up a bottle that has the best before date arriving within a year or so rather than one that has 3 years left. A fresher bottle just does not deliver the same great aroma and flavor of a slightly aged one. A year makes a huge difference with this brew IMO.  Notes II: holy bejesus! The devil is kickin my ass here!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,gotbeer,4.2,"The appearance is cloudy, with an obviously thick head. This is not a beer you need to pour aggressively to get an acceptable head. The smell is great with a slight hint of hops. I'm not sure what it is about this beer that is different- be it the bohemian hops or the belgian yeast? Either way, the flavor is great. Excellent balance of hops and malt. Incredible fruit flavor.

Slightly hazy pale yellow-gold color, with massive amount of carbonation, bubbles just kept coming, full chunky white head, nice lace trail. No strong smells, light citrus, some coriander, typical lager smells. Flavour is also quite light, more tangy citrus and some spice, touch of weiss yeast finish. Nice finish of balancing hops. Smooth finish, its not until the beer hits your stomach that you feel the warmth from the high alcohol content. Perfect for a cold day.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

The have mastered the art of blending the basic ingredients with only the finest adjuncts the world has ever seen. Duvel is a prime example of this gift. Long known as one of the best that Belgium has to offer, Duvel makes a point to demonstrate what a good beer should taste like every time you open the bottle. Pouring a golden orange colour, it resembles a cross between a strong ale and a pilsner. Beautiful head perches atop the beer, thick and frothy. The sences are overwhelmed with the aroma of sugars, grapefruit, apples, pepper, and other spices. Almost like walking into a bakery. The taste is spicey with strong fruity flavors, a spicey kick and a sweet finish. This is a beer you really want your sences at their peek for.

It pours a cloudy lemon yellow color and has a thick white head that leaves a ton of lace in my glass. It has a fruity, yeasty aroma and a very yeasty fruity flavor.

222,695,pentathlete,4.63,"I stumbled--luckily--onto a 4-pack (330 ml) with Duvel tulip at the local craft outlet (Mug & Chalice, Chesterfield, VA).  Pours as advertised. Cloudy yellow, large foamy suds-like head that stayed put. Column of bubbles erupted from the ""etched-D"" at the bottom of the glass until I consumed the whole thing. Tres cool.  This smelled very much like the Hennepin from the Moortgat-operated Ommegang. Yeasty, floral, citrus-rind.  The taste was immediately malty and hoppy: is that what bittersweet means? This alternates between tasting like a lager, an ale, a saison...I can't keep up.  The mouthfeel was not as full and creamy as I had hoped, given the size of the head on this drink. But it was consistent from start to finish. Perhaps the hops asserted themselves too early, but then the malt comes through. This beer gives you everything at once and it is up to your brain to figure it out.  Now, given the 8.5% abv, this should have some alcohol kick. I tasted none of it. I felt it around the 11th ounce. This beer is scarily easy to drink. I will not consume this if I have to drive because I don't think I could limit myself to one or two.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Looks like it should--beautiful almost-cloudy golden, with gorgeous big bubbles in the carbonation and a soft, pillowy, cloudlike head. Smells like a Czech Pils, which was scary, but the nose changes when the head is disturbed (like in drinking). Hops, citrus? Orange rind.  What a mouthfeel! Lively and smooth, exactly how it should be. Tastes good, not too many specifics that I can pinpoint, but generally floral, mild orange, hops, and some light esthers. Damn I love this glass. Just beautiful all the way through; amazing lacing and the head is determined.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Beastdog75,3.74,"(330 ml bottle, white label, ""best before 09 2007"")  Ah... this is my first ""evil"" beer. Duvel may be a mass produced beer, but this beer is still proof that a big brewery can still be considered a ""craft"" brewery. This beer might not be everyone's cup of tea, and I myself probably wouldn't make this beer a regular habit, but this is definitely a must try for anyone who considers themselves a serious beer drinker.  Duvel pours a deceptive gold color, to which the uninitiated might confuse it with a standard fizzy yellow beer. When poured in the Duvel glass, the head is gargantuan, and a flurry of bubbles are visible within the golden liquid. The foam retains extremely well and leaves some nice sticky lace. The aroma had some light sweetness, spiciness, and yeastiness to it. As it warmed, the smell become increasingly more spicy. The bubbly mouthfeel hits the tongue and ""stings"" it slightly, and combined with the alcoholic warmth this beer feels a bit ""hot."" The flavor has some light sweetness and fruitiness, but the main flavor includes a huge spicy and peppery flavor. The alcohol does show up a bit in the flavor as well. The overall flavor combined with the hops make the finish drying and bitter. In the aftertaste, the dryness/bitterness linger on with a green apple-like fruitiness accompanying it. Further on (about 5 minutes later), a herbal/tea like aftertaste arrived. I was tasting this beer well after I finished off the glass. The beer concludes with a nice warming sensation.  This is a beautiful looking brew with a unique taste that is surprisingly easy to drink. I didn't know what to think of it at first, but the taste grew on me (I would say it improved as the beer grew warmer). A classic.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Pours a golden color with a massive, and yes, I do mean massive white head that simply will not go away, and leaves a nice lacing on the glass. A slight fruity, golden raisin with slight spice and lemon aroma. The taste is of multiple fruits (but not overbearing or overpowering) with some citrus and bannanas, and a great balance of spicy hops and a wonderful bitterness. It fills the mouth perfectly, without being too heavy; you can &lt;barely&gt; feel the extent of the alcohol as you swallow- you really get the perfect amount of bite in this. Even though in terms of alcohol I've definitely hit my limit, I desperately want another one IMMEDIATELY.  Overall, one of the most perfect beers I've ever had. Really, it's so fantastic, that I can't explain strongly enough how wonderful it is. There's really very little that I can complain about with this one.

Absolutely delicious, medium bodied with plenty of soft carbonation. Belgian yeast flavors show up along with a sour sweetness and a bit of an apple-fruity taste.

The yeast at the bottom of the bottle is not evident in the Duvel glass. Smell is similar to a light nutty wheat malt with light/medium flowery and spruce lemon/lime hops. The taste is a sweet solid, moderate, and nutty wheat malt; moderate herbal, spruce, grapefruit, and lemon/lime hops; a light doughy and nutty yeast; and a sweet finish with hints of white wine or champagne, butterscotch, and possibly vanilla. The mouthfeel is a light/medium body, dry texture, soft/lively carbonation, with a slightly metallic finish.

Strong fruits and sugar make up the clean and pure nose of this brew. Taste is massively sweet and spiced applepie and pear, yet somehow it does not seem unbalanced at all. Aftertaste could linger abit longer but still very good. Alcohol comes through mostly up front and lends it's warmth to the drinker.

This beer is almost indescribable. It seduces you with fruity and spicy aromas and flavors, yet every drink begs another, until the 4 pack that you bought is gone. And, of course you're incapacitated on the floor from the 8.5 ABV. Think of a heavy bodied beer, how it tastes/feels, then somehow make it as easy to drink as iced tea.

Fizzy yeast that tickle the nose. Nice  Bit hit of fruity yeast upfront. Nice. Followed by a really juicy citrus BANG that is from either the malt or the hop--I can't tell. There is a really nice alcohol dryness at the end.  The mouthfeel is what takes the cake. It's like I'm tasting the stars. Or wait--that's a bit of a trite simile.

A nice mouthwatering smell.  Taste- Very sweet and sugary fruitiness. Some bitter hops and a light tinge of medicinal alcohol.  Mouthfeel- This is one damn carbonated beer. Way to much for me. Took me about an hour to suck down this bottle, which was good because the taste came out a bit more as the carbonation went down.  Drinkability- If I let this one sit for an hour before drinking it would have been better. The carbonation is about the only drawback in this beer for me.

Poured into a large sniffter, this beer appears to be clear. It's a golden honey, clear colour. But no, that's an optical illusion. It appears clear, but it's actually quite cloudy. I couldn't see through the glass like I thought I could. Large, puffy, five finger head that ever so slowly settles down to three. Lace abounds the glass like etched artwork. I wonder, how can this look any better? Simply put, it can't. Such a delicate aroma. Spices, peppers, sweet and pale malts, juicy apples, ripe pears, and an almost juicy hop bitterness. Tastes just as good as it smells. Starts out with a bready maltiness, mingled with a pepper and spice taste that tingles the tongue. Middle is very fruity. Dry apples, pears, and just a touch of sourness. Citrus maybe? Leaves with a spicy bitterness, with still a bit of sweet and juicy fruit. Damn, what a mouthfeel. Smooth, thick and creamy.

The head also seemingly defies the laws of physics - it sits unevenly on the beer, asymmetrically dipping into the beer around the rim. Tough to explain, but it really doesn't look like something that should occur in normal gravity. Beautiful, near-perfect aroma of muscadine grapes, pears, Belgian yeast, and a whiff of alcohol. Taste is a little understated. Like a typical Belgian blonde, the palate is dominated by yeast, a touch of light malt, and a fleeting sweetness on the finish. Mouthfeel is a little foamy. Still, very drinkable. A wonderful Belgian ale.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

The taste was so far out there and unique I loved it immediately. I dont have regular access to it so when I saw the gift pack of 4 bottles and a glass I jumped on it.  Pours a gorgeous golden color with a head so thick you need a spoon. You could even float a bottle cap on it Jim Koch!!! Great lacing all the way down the glass. If it wasnt for the huge head I would think BUD-really!!!  Wonderful aroma. Sulphury. Phenolic. Earthy. Woody. Spicy. Extremely complex. Black pepper essence.  Extremely citrusy flavor. Spicy notes. Yeasty. Malty with a tart finish.  Body is extremely complex as well. The beer is very ""bright"" on the tongue. Somewhat sweet at first but dries out quickly.  An amazing brew. My first all 5s.

Tons of white head that leaves good lacing and doesn't go away.  Smell is not overpowering and slightly sweet. Fruity smell of apple cider and fresh apple peel with a bit of grain.  Taste was clean, crisp, and refreshing. No trace of the 8.5% abv anywhere around and not overtly bitter or sour, slightly swet.  Mouth is amazing. Rich, creamy, and well carbonated. goes down smooth as silk.  If not for the 8.5% abv, this would be awesome for extended sessions.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,trumick,4.68,"Pours a pale golden color with a huge head that stays forever. The lacing stuck to the entire glass for the duration. The head looks like a fluffy cloud after the beer sits a while, nice.  Smell is of wheat, banana, yeast and slight alcohol.  Taste is very nice, clove, banana, lemon, yeasty, with a slight bitter, dry, hop finish. My,my,my this is lovely.  Mouthfell is great smooth, velvety, (did I say the most smooth and refreshing beer ever) medium bodied with excelent carbination, small bubbles.  Drinkability is incredible, I could put these away all night. The alcohol is nicely balanced with the malt and hops.  This is the best example of this style that I have tried. Duvel is smooth and deceiving. This beer will sneak up on you and kick you in the arse. It is sooo smooth and tasty, you won't notice the alcohol until the Duvel boot is planted forcefully on your backside.  Great, Great Beer!!!!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,bashiba,4.06,"Pours an absolutly stunning Golden Yellow with a huge pillowy white head that seems to linger forever, and leaves tons and tons of thick white lacing all the way down the side of the goblet. Maybe one of the best looking beers I have ever poured.  Smelled of a heavy honey and citrus flavors with a nice creamy maltiness coming through.  Tasted as it smelled with a heavy sweet honey malt flavor mixing well with a zesty citrus and wheat flavors that is quickly balanced nicely by the decent earthy hops.  Mouthfeel was very creamy and pleasant which lends to a very good drinkability on this yummy belgian.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,twilight,4.95,"This is the quintessential Belgian Beer. Yes, it's way too commercial and too popular, but, really, there's a reason for that. It embodies all the characteristics of Yum City. The pour into its own tulip is a golden body with a thick pillowy head even with a slow, unhurried pour. I love making it froth and almost escape from the glass. Huge, thick feathery down lacing along the glass. Scent is sugar and spice and everything nice. Well, just spice and sweetness wafting forth. Taste is a bomb of spiciness and bitternessa dn finishing off slightly bitter with a warm sweetness and ending with the hops. I have to mark down mouthfeel only because the bubbles are occasionally intrusive. They fill the mouth and you really have to fight them to taste the beer and then it's over and you have the nicest hops and spice coating your tongue... I really could drink this all night. Bring a couple of four packs or a few 750's and you've got the perfect night.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,chunkylover53,3.48,"I tried this once before and was unimpressed. But then I had it in the proper galss and it made a world of difference.  Duvel pours a beautiful cloudy yellow colour with a huge head. It looks like someone dropped a big chunk of merengue in my beer. I had Mike Meyers come over to make fun of it so it would cry itself to sleep on it's huge pillow.  You'd think that this would make it difficult to drink, but when you use the correct glass, the head moves back into the bulbous part, revealing a nice fruity, wheaty brew.  Still not amazing, but much, much better than drinking it out of a normal chalice.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Fish113d,3.98,"When I poured this into my Duvel goblet ""Trusty"", it poured a nice honey/gold color w/ a nice large foamy head that SLOWLY dissipated, and appears to be a medium to full bodied beer.  UPon smell, I had a hard time distinguishing anything major, but I found it to be malty w/ a slight belgian fruitiness (if that makes any sense)- citrus maybe.  Taking the first sip, I caught some pale malts w/ honey, and even some light hops flavor w/ some fruitiness that I was not able to distinguish what fruit it was. However, great flavor!  Mouthfeel- the carbonation stings the front of your tongue right away, and the body is more medium than it looked. This even left a pretty pleasant aftertaste. I had 2 bottles due to how drinkable it was!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,CAMRAhardliner,4.75,"Ahhhh Duvel... one of my favorite beers of all time. I cant believe I never got around to reviewing it yet.  It pours a cloudy glowing gold color with torrents of multi-sized bubbles racing to the top. The head is a sight to behold. Its enourmous and lasts forever. It has big bubbles at the base and mocroscopic bubbles at the top that make it look like vanilla ice cream, truly remarkable. It coats the glass with loosely formed rings of thick lace.  The aroma is a delicious blend of bready malts, citrus, floral hops, green apple skins and candy sugar. Theres also an incredible yeast smell thats spicy and typically Belgian. The taste is remarkably hoppy and also very citrusy and malty. Its reminiscent of Orval. The hops are grassy and herbal and the malt has a great perfumey character. The flavor is very full and rounded.  The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and creamy. The finish has an alcohol kick and then a prolonged, intriguing green apple tartness mingled with hoppy bitterness and Belgian yeast. This beer is close to perfect, everyone should try it.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,dgallina,4.63,"Pours a pale, cloudy yellow with a very substantial white head which slowly subsides into lots of clingy lacing. Aromatic and appetizing, with plenty of hop flower smell backed by alcoholic spice and yeasty notes. Mellow, subtle, and rounded flavors. The floral and hop bitterness are intertwined and constantly vying for your attention. Very well balanced with neither flavor over-powering the other. A great dry finish which leaves you wanting more. Lovely creamy, yet carbonated body. Very light and easy to drink despite the 8.5% ABV.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,WetCoaster,4.38,"Appearance: Slightly cloudy pear gold with very active fine carbonation. The head is simply a marvel to behold; pure white, whipped cream thick, rocky with endless retention. It leaves little foam ""icebergs"" after a while, although a quick swirl will instantly bring back a perfect head. Wow. Needless to say, leaves thick lacing on the glass wall. For this style, it's just flawless.  Smell: If you had to bottle ""Belgian Ale"" fragrance, this would be your first choice. Billowing waves of scent first reveal sharp citrus/lemon, pear, and a bit of spiced apple. The ""meat"" of the scent is an herby, yeasty spiciness with strong notes of clove. As it warms, a caramel maltiness makes itself known.  Taste/Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is suprisingly light and crisp, given the big ABV. The flavor starts spicy, with the usual corriander/clove mix. The body is all sweet candi sugar and caramel malt. The finish sours up with a combination of citrus and bittering hops. Good stuff.  Drinkability: Insanely drinkable for such a big beer. Light, crisp, but also quite complex and flavorful. Really hard to beat.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Aroma: champagne like with some peppery spiciness and some malt in the background. pretty good.  Taste: astringent hops with a good malt backbone that provides a nice texture and good bitterness. Dry, bitter aftertaste with a nice alcohol presence. Wonderfully crisp, bitter, and smooth.  Mouthfeel: crisp but not thin. carbonation is prickly and does a great job.  Drinkability: 8.5% hardly noticeable. I'll definately have another.  Notes: This is a quite enjoyable brew that I could drink every night. I love the hops. The bitterness is just wonderful.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,rousee,4.68,"Pours a pure blonde gold -honey color with an extremely appealing degree of murkiness. You can almost see the other side of the glass, yet you can't-like a mirage in the desert. Pours one of these fluffy lemon-merengue pie type heads and settles within a few mins. to a speckling of foam on top. Fabulous thick lace is left on the side of the glass with nice consistent rings.  Lemon, honey, sour apples and some maltiness are the things I am getting on my nose when I take a whiff. Very clean and some grassines too.  Taste is just amazing. There is some tart chalky fruitiness up front. It has some stickiness but finishes light and dry. The alcohol is not very strong tasting and this comes in at 8.5%. This is a testament to the expertise of these people. They own Ommegang and I have been buying Ommegang stuff cuz it was 1/2 the price. There's a reason this stuff costs more..(besides being imported)  Mouthfeel is great-Kinda dry but satisfying, warm and clean. Drinkability -I need to make sure I never have more than 2 or 3 of these bomber bottles laying around or I will simply have to drink them all.

222,695,blitheringidiot,4.06,"This thing practically jumped into me Duvel glass all by itself, filling up with about ½ DUVEL and ½ cloud like pillowy snow white head that popped and stuck to the glass as it dissipated. Slightly hazy light straw hues with a fountain of beading bubbles erupting from the etched calligraphy D from the bottom of the glass. (A must have for any beernut.) After a minute or so to settle, the second pour went thru the four inch meringue clouds. A perfect pour that left stratus lace and a mini volcano of puffy capping throughout the pour that is fueled with effervescent bubbles.. This might be the most ever written about the appearance since Bells Sparkling Ale.  Belgian yeast strand aroma.  Yeasty bready doughy taste. Peppery awl-kee-hawl esters abound with some JuicyFruit gum A bit vanilla bean malts ease up and a short sticky bread pudding aftertaste.  Light to medium bodied. Rock solid carbonation that wont quit a bit and is in it to win it.  8.5 % ABV is scary due to the simple delight of the brew.   Last swigs: So the hunter has become the hunted. Duvel is a Belgian institution inunto itself. Now, so many other Belgian styled American beers more readily available at more affordable prices have surpassed this offering in many ways. Special tanx to BA Shapudding for the DUVEL glass. Truly, proper glassware is essential to enjoyment. I have a bomber in the cellar that will be excitedly opened at a later date to do an update.

222,695,orbitalr0x,3.83,"Duvel pours a cloudy yellow with hints of orange and an incredibly massive foamy head. I was pouring slowly and the head simply erupted. Looks nice in the glass...almost the same as on the bottle...and it's not going anywhere. The smell has a spicy peppery hint to it along with a nice pale malt profile. Hints of alcohol and floral hops come through in the nose.  The first taste is wonderfully smooth with a nice malt profile and hints of peppery spice. There are some light citrus tones as well...and as I drink some nice lacing begins to build up on my glass. Hops balance out the brew well. The yeast seems to impart a sort of outdoor/earthy flavor on my tounge as well. Overall good flavor on this one.  The mouthfeel is good, but there is a bit too much carbonation for me here. Seems a little too fizzy going down. Otherwise it is very smooth. Drinkability is good as well and I could see myself having a few of these.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,travolta,4.33,"750ml bottle; corked.  Appearance: I will start with the head. The head from this beer is white, tiny bubbles producing a very foamy froth. Lacing is all over the glass and retention, well, you could die waiting for this ale to fall asleep. The color was a straw yellow. At first it was champagne white, but the more you pour, the darker it gets. As it sits, the head will get rocky. Colorado has nothing on Duvel.  Nose: When I brought my nose to the rim of the glass I was greeted pleasantly by my new friend. I smelled pineapple, dry crackers, and tiny bits of lemon holding up the rear. I could also smell spring water. I may be crazy, but when I picture standing next to a clean stream or spring, this would be what I would smell.  Taste: Crisp. The tiny bubbles excite and awaken your tongue from its usual slumber. Do not swallow to early, for the bubbles will fight you all the way down. The taste is buttery, slight lemon and alcohol. Some freshly baked crackers, or light wheat bread.  Notes: A VERY drinkable beer. One of the many things that draw me to this beer is that the novice and the expert can with some patience enjoy it. Few beers offer such calm complexity.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,abcsofbeer,3.88,"I have heard so many good things about this one that the anticipation was heavy. The beer label says to pour carefully and to take your time, which is what I did, being that it is bottle fermented. It pours a very pale amber, straw color with a good deal of carbonation bubbles rising to the top. By pouring slowly, I was able to create a perfect head, about an inch thick, a white, rocky froth. Belgian lace is all over the glass from the beginning to end.  The aroma is distinct, an alcohol tinged banana coconut smell. Hard to pinpoint, though. The taste is faintly alcoholic and yeasty. It leaves a slight bitter aftertaste. This is a distinct and unique beer that has few equals.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,jahsausage,3.46,"Trying this beer again after about 5 years, back then me and a friend drank it out of a bottle and complained. This time around I poured into the closest glassware I could find to the one pictured and it came out a nice ""hazy lager"" colour with a pure white head that refused to go away. This time around I can certainly appreciate the taste a lot more, it is definitely a ""yeasty"" beer which can scare a lot of people off. The taste is probably the best i've had in this range of alcohol strength, how the hell do those belgians manage to hide that alcohol taste? it continues to amaze me.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,stjarnflikka,4.38,"First off is the pour wich is an enjoyment in itself. The beer bears a golden colour and is quite ""fuzzy"". Its not clear and bears traces of yeast. With a little aid from the special glass the bubbles create a wonderful fountain from the center bottom swirling up to the high, high foam mountain wich is snow-white.  The aroma bears a strong fruity and yeasty smell with an underlying tone from the alcohol. Its fresh and distinctue.  The taste hits you quite aggressive and is clearly malty and fruity with an underlying citrus-smell. After a while you get a dominating sweet and malty taste with finishes off as quite dry and somewhat alcoholic. Surprisingly the alcohol does'nt take over or anything like that, good and bad (depending on how many you drink ;p)  Some people seem to think that the taste is too powerful and the 8,5% should say: ""dont drink more than one!"" but i totally disagree. I can sit and sip at these little suckers all evening and all night long.

222,695,meathookjones,4.51,"This came in a corked 750ml bottle. After finally wrestling the cork out of the bottle I poured this into a snifter where a huge fluffy white head formed that peaked over the glass. The body was a hazy yellow color. The head gradually collapses into a rocky cavernous landscape with chunks of lace strewn about the glass. The second fill of the glass the body was much murkier. The aroma had hints of apple with a spice and yeast notes present as well. The spice was the main contributor to the smell as this warmed to room temp. A bit of malt sweetness is the first thing you taste before the spice comes in and sticks around though the finish. This has a very clean and crisp taste that has a strong bready and yeasty presence. Mouthfeel on this is medium to full with a very filling quality about it even when you take a small sip. Drinkability is perfect, I could drink this all day or until I hit the floor as the 8.5% does not show at all.

Pours a cloudy golden yellow with a super frothy white head that lingers for the duration.  The aroma screams spices. Not much fruity aroma detected at all.  The flavors are malty and citrusy. Honey, lemon, and a hint of pepper that warms the beer well with each drink.  The mouthfeel is robust and definitely not shy with a lingering spicy taste.  A very strong beer not intended for session drinking but a good choice for a belgian ale nonetheless.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Bierman9,4.11,"Newly sampled after purchased from the bar-car on the Eurostar from Brussels to London... Small bottle with a white label and red lettering. Medium-to-pale golden and clear, Duvel has lots of bubbles rising topside. It was topped by a huge, billowy, white, marshmallow-like head. The initial head/bier ratio was about 2:3. The fluffiness lasts and lasts, to the last drop, and lacing is top-shelf! A lovely sight!! Nose exhibits some bready malt along with a spicy/peppery character. The body of Duvel was medium, yet it had a prickly feel due to the abundant carbonation. Taste produces a sort of bready/crackery malt giving a smidge of sweetness to the palate, and even a hint of tartness. Then comes the pepper and spice notes for a lovely finish. Yeasties poured in at the end of the session clouded things up yet added more spicy aspects. I can also feel the ""heat"" a bit as it descends. Much better than my last experience, especially while zipping through the English countryside. Prosit!!  overall: 4.2 appearance: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | mouthfeel: 3.5 | drinkability: 4.5  *** ***  (Original review of 16MAR02). Had this from an 11.2 oz bottle. I like strong Belgians, Dubbels, Trippels, but, frankly, I was not impressed by this. Light golden-straw color; a bit hazy, with a big whipped-cream head. Nose was spicy, yeasty, even salty. Medium body, but a bit prickly on the tongue. More spiciness in its flavor, slight fruitiness, crisp and ends dry. Not bad, but not my top bier. But everyone has different tastes, right? I respect others opinions, so let's move on and drink some more.... (4.0/3.5/3.5/3.5/3.5 = 3.60)  74",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Pegasus,4.45,"Appearance: Hazy brassy golden in color; yields a massive snow-white head when poured properly into a Duvel tulip chalice. The head is remarkably persistent, there is a profusion of thick sticky lace, constantly renewed by the slow-rising streams of carbonation. Great clumps of foam linger to the bottom of the glass.  Aroma: Densely spicy, with strong clove notes, earthy yeast notes, and bread malt.  Taste: Begins with a slightly sweet malt note and green apple peel, towards the middle of the taste, bread and yeast notes dominate, finishes with a wave of mild and warming alcohol  Mouth feel: Slightly tingling carbonation combines with a rich and full feel.  Drinkability/notes: A ubiquitous classic, the fact that Duvel is so readily available may cause one to hold it in contempt, resist this temptation. A remarkably elegant beer that compares quite well to champagne. I suspect that the experience is greatly enhanced by the use of proper glassware. This is a beer that is not to be missed.

The head on this beer is as good as it comes. Very thick and fluffy throughout the entire glass. It never got less than a quarter inch thick. As far as the aroma goes, this is where the tulip shaped glass shined! All of the floral fruitness is concentrated to the exact spot that your nose hits as you take a sip. Yeasty explosions fill the nostrils and remind you that you are enjoying one of Belgium's finest. Taste...this beer has all the pieces to make this a true classic.

222,695,Cwrw,4.62,"Aged for 1 year and a half.  Luxurious ultra-foamy aspirin white head forms quickly, remaining until the first sip, after which it slowly puts on a magnificent churning, foaming show, until it reaches a good 3 or 4 centimetres. Upon my word, the head is like a living thing. Untouched, it remains like styrofoam. Sometimes it appears so thick it looks like ice cream sticking to the side of the glass. Lacing is the thickest I have ever seen. The liquid is almost rose-wine coloured, slightly pink and occasionally almost white. Light light orange and very pale, with only fleeting golden glimpses. Whilst at first it appears to be transparent, held up to the light it is clearly not, but quite thick and murky. Aroma immediately is sugary aged peaches or nectarines, along with a baking-bread yeast smell. A definite aged smell to this bottle: musky, dusty, and very mature. The sweetness borders on sourness, and some honey aromas become clear. Candy apples, pears, apricots, sugar-rich candy, light but very bready malt, ripe green apples, soap characteristics; not as spicy as it is sweet. Taste delivers on the aroma fully. What struck me immediately was how incredibly drinkable this was for a strong Belgian. The taste is a superbly balanced experience. I was expecting cloying sweetness with some fruity yeast, but it has so much more. The hops, undetectable in the aroma, complement the sweetness expertly. Dusty, full yeast taste on the middle, giving green apples again strongly, along with other fruits, perhaps pear. Toasted malt with strong caramel and semi-sourness, almost akin to tomato juice if tasted strongly enough. Very full, yet it disappears in effervescence on the tongue in a slight tingle and foaminess. When exhaling with the beer in the mouth, I get strong dough or pasta tastes. Some fresh pine wood tastes. The aftertaste for me personally was all green apples and sugary pear. Yes, the phenols are there, but at first I did not even notice the alcohol--it was that smooth and balanced. Certainly it does not suggest 8.5%. This bottle seemed to be very foamy, but not overly gaseous in the mouth. The lees, tasted separately, give super fresh apple and fresh dough smells, dust and ultra-sweetness. The lees give the beer even more of a white appearance, almost like a wit-bier. Smooth in the mouth, very full, it tasted basically as though I had poured some dry yeast into a glass full of lukewarm water and consumed it. The yeast made the beer warmer. Personal verdict: one of the best. This is classic beer, and when aged it accrues even greater proportions, like a classic novel written a hundred years ago. This is something most people will revisit again and again, with friends, on memorable occasions. This beer is one of the few I have found that have an indescribable quality about them; it is not easy to put into words why this is such heavenly liquid.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,ithacabaron,3.93,"Appearences can be deceiving.  But then you'd expect that from Duvel, the devil of beers, laughing heartily with it's devilish deviltry.  It pours a bright blonde with an enormous, creamy, dense head on top, a beautiful sight to see, but not one you'd expect for it's headiness and strength.  Aromas are of over-ripe fruit soaked in liquor, and delicious yeast, a full mouthful in itself, pulling the drinker in.  Tastes are of rum-soaked apricots, black pepper, ripe banana, and, way in the back, cooked green apples. The very first sip is warming and tempting, but urging you on.  Mouthfeel is very creamy and smooth, appropriately heavy on the tongue.  Drinkability is lower, if only because the intoxication (alcoholic and otherwise) gets to be too much when several are had.  Still, a fine beer for all occasions, and I imagine it would be fun to use this in a bait and switch on a Bud drinker. Ha!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Aroma of great peppery lemon seed with yeasty brightness. Flavors of hay fields and banana trees. Vanilla and freshly cut grass. A white pepper spiciness lasts forever. A little harsh biting carbonation at first, but after sitting for ten minutes or so a creaminess appears. Medium-thin body is pleasant and crisp yet lasting.  Every time I have this beer I feel differently about it, so my review may change often. There have been times where I would have given it a perfect score, and times that I am disappointed by a harsh bite.

The head subsided in such a way that it reminded of what happens when you heat marshmallows and then let it cool quickly, sort of a deflating effect. Left a nice blanket of foam over the beer.  Smelled fruity and alcoholic.  Flavour of malty sweetness throughout each sip. A mid sip hop bitterness is present, but only slightly noticeable. The warmth of the alcohol really takes over towards the end. Taste is a tad phenolic as well.  This just feels so damn smooth and creamy in your mouth. It's like it explodes in your mouth after you sip it in (well maybe that's a bit exaggerated, but it's close).  A good session beer except for the 8.5% abv.

222,695,noclue,4.73,"Serving type: 750ml bottle corked and caged. Served in tulip glass.  Appearance: slightly hazy golden yellow. Huge fluffy billowing head with soapy sticky lacing.  Smell: Spice, ground pepper. Fruity, yeasty, sweet, sweet malt aromas.  Taste: Sweet and fruity up front. Wham! sweet and fruity turns to bold and phenolic, which fades into spicy hops and alcohol. The alchol is present, yet pleasant and very much wanted.  Mouthfeel: Light and smooth. Streaming effervescent carbonation is crisp and refreshing.   Drinkability/Overall: So light and crisp that you forget about the high ABV. Easy to drink and a pleasure to enjoy! A devil of a treat!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Bierguy5,4.08,"From the stubbie bottle pours a slightly hazy golden liquid, with a thick, fluffy white head. So far, this is one great looking brew. Some lace on the glass, as the head shrinks, but never fully disappears. Swirling the glass brings another rise to the head. Smells slightly yeasty, with some spice to it, almost peppery. Pale malt flavor, with some tartness, slight fruit notes to go with a slight spicey flavor. Slightly bitter in the finish. The alcohol is noticable at the end. High carbonation makes this have an almost creamy mouthfeel. Overall, what a classic! Nothing is overpowering. This has a good amount of alcohol, but you might not notice it until it is too late. Damn you devil!! Welcome to the dark side!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,kosmoraios,4.43,"One of my favourite commercially-available beers of all time. This beer is best enjoyed in a tulip glass. Pours a nice, golden color, and is a bit hazy with the ""in-the-bottle"" fermentation yeast. Has an excellent, foamy head that remains the entire time you are drinking it. You can eat the head with a fork. The smell is exquisite, with spicy and fruity tones and a bit of malt. The taste is wonderful. I enjoy belgian ales, and this one is excellent for a bottled beer commercially available in the USA. It is a strong, crisp, spicy ale with a bit of fruitiness that goes down incredibly smooth. I highly recommend this for anyone, anytime, but especially one who is trying out the Belgian style. Excellent ale!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Gagnonsux,3.09,"I'm still not a huge fan of Belgian ales, but I enjoyed Duvel a lot more than the two Chimay varieties I tried earlier this week.  Appearance- Hazy golden color with slight orange tint. Head is enormous and very thick and creamy. Lots of lace are left on the sides of my Duvel glass.  Smell- Spices and mild apple smell. Not too overpowering, but still not my favorite beer smell.  Taste- Sip begins with mild hops bite which leads to a rounded spice flavor. Hints of apple are noted. Overall taste isn't too strong in the spice department as I found Chimay to be. Finish is dry and crisp. Definently a complex taste, but not a style I'm into.  Drinkability- Wouldn't want to drink too many of these because Duvel is fairly heavy and strong in alcohol. I think this would be a great introductory beer to the Belgian style, as it is complex and not as overpowering on the palate as the Chimay Tripel and Dark.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

According to the picture on the package, this is normal.  It tastes very sweet with a fruity yet bitter aftertaste. The first sip tasted a bit reminiscent of my Colt 45 days, but it has a very extravagant array of tastes that follow the initial shock.  As for drinkability, I'd say this is a beer to try once in a while.

There is obvious citrus in the aroma, as well as banana and raisins. The fruit is spiced with hints of clove.  Taste: The sweetness from the fruit flavors help to smooth out the sharpness and slight bits of sour. The carbonation is slightly sharp and it tingles on the tongue. There is a bit of grape in with the other fruity flavors. Great mouthfeel  Notes: This beer has a nice warming quality. Because of it's great flavors and it's balanced taste, this one will stay in my good graces.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,tfinn,4.41,"I was thinking ""orval"" in my mind when I asked the steward at the beer store for two bottles of duvel. ""do you want the small or the big bottles?"" he asked. the big ones of course.  pours bright clear golden yellow with a wonderfully large fine creamy-bubbled head, fed by champagne-like trails of carbonation. lacing? but of course!  the smell is primarily sweet fresh malt with aromatic hops somewhere deep in the profile, beckoning the drinker to imbibe. reminds me of sweet straw. (not grass.)  taste is a perfect balance between sweet maltiness and bitterness. (I keep trying to think of how it could be improved, but fail to come up with ideas.) there are some sharp flavors in here, perhaps phenolic in nature? definitely not fruity esters. it could be the yeast: it settles out very well in the bottle, but I'm sure some of it remains in suspension. I'm one of those people for whom sour and bitter are very close in taste; it wouldn't surprise me if people found sour components in the flavor, or just found it overly bitter. for me it's perfect.  mouthfeel is thin yet thick with complexity. it's a little grainy, but that works in this situation. overall impression is light, but still substantial flavor-wise. the fine carbonation helps the proces. the finish is clean, with perhaps a faint hint of alcohol, but nowhere near what is expected for an 8.5% beer. its drying properties only encourage another drink.  drinkability? going through a full 750ml of duvel would not be a problem due to its exceptional attenuation and clean finish -- but I know better. this devil is one to make deals with in moderation.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Left good sticky lace and had carbonation to make champagne jealous. Sweet, bready and fruity aromas. Pale malt, tropical fruit and a herbaceous sweetness. Light, tart belgian yeast at the end. Complex taste. Bready malt, pineapple, apples, pears and a light citrusy yeast. Finished with a bittersweet flavor that was a bit like fennel. This had a little funkiness to it but in a good way. The alcohol was also present but hid reasonably well. Great melding of flavors. Light bodied with a creamy, bubbly mouthfeel and a crisp dry finish. Great drinkability.

Aroma: Saaz present initially in the nose, and it does well to bring out other spices from the yeast--slight clove, slight orange as well.  Taste: Saaz very prevalent, and provides a delicious spicy balance to the Belgian yeast. Orange/clove, maybe even a bit of cumin is present in the palate. There is a yeastiness that gives a bit of a bready flavor, yet there is a tartness that complements this breadiness well--almost like the raw dough of christopsomi.  Mouthfeel: Body is light and the alcohol definitely comes through and kicks you through it.

Watch the gas - a bottle of this stuff nearly killed me when the cork decided to release itself.  The head this beer forms is ridiculous  it will occupy half your glass. However, the mouthfeel is not too gassy at all, and is very creamy.  The aroma is very malty and yeasty, akin to jam tarts, and a minute hint of alcohol.  The flavour is like a lager that was made yeasty, very malty and very strong, and it is really rather a nice drink. Hints of citrus notes can also be detected, and there is a nice bitter finish.

222,695,studentofbeer,4.4,"duvel, my first belgian love.  i opened the short bottle with the new ""old"" white label and up spurted some head right to the top of the bottle, despite the fact that it had been at rest forever. You know why they built the duvel glass so big.  I pour the beer into a duvel glass. the huge head puffs up tremendously, looking like an unfinished sculpture. The beer itself is a straw yellow with an orangey hint when you look straight through the glass. its not a beautiful color, though it is amazingly clear, and when you see it with the monstrous head it looks like a work of art.  my first swoop through the beer's aroma brought out grassy and kumquat flavors, with a bit of that special funk one associates with belgian yeast. now that the head has fallen to a much smaller level--though still with a contorted shape--i stick my nose deep in the glass and reveal a bundle of fruit flavors--green apple skin, pear, peach, and key lime pie along with floral overtones much like hibiscus. though the detectors in my nostrals may be shot by now, there's also a deep bready flavor that pokes through at the end of the fruit and flower medley.  on to the taste. those bread flavors really start to come through in that first big sip--it's sweet and soft with a bit of fruit character on the middle of the tongue, though less than the nose. A sweet herbal taste descends into a dry, mineral-like finish. from what i understand this beer began its life long ago as an english or scottish ale, and the firm bready middle really recalls that region. the saaz hops and super pale malt (pilsner malt?) bring it over to the belgian side.  Duvel sits up there with some of the best. the complexity of the taste is not overwhelming, but the balance between sweet and dry is phenomenal. also, the 8.5% abv hides incredibly well in such an ""open"" beer-- the hops and malt are in almost perfect unity, one leading to the other, and the strength doesn't reveal itself at all in the flavor profile. the best indication that it's there, other than the bottle, is i just tried to write ""halt and mops"" rather than malt and hops.  as an end note, once the beer warms a bit a peppery alcohol taste steps in front of the warm bready flavors. in my opinion this is definitely a beer to enjoy on the cooler side of the temperature scale.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Suds,4.58,"Ive had this beer dozens of times, I was shocked that I hadnt reviewed it. From a corked 750 ml bottle, it pours with an enormous white head. The head is head itself is absolutely amazing. Stable and rocky, with large pockets between the bubbles. It reminds me of glass insulating foam (the kind used on chemical piping). Lace is phenomical. The aroma is flowery, a mix of hops and esters. Its got a peppery tinge to the smell as well. The beer itself is crystal clear and effervescent. My glass has a scoring at the bottom, and the steady stream of bubbles that rises from it looks vaguely like a flame on a roaring fire. The taste is sweet up front, followed by an intense hoppiness. I remember the surprise that I experienced when I first tasted this beer. Its so intensely flavorful. In some beers, the aroma is the dominant attribute, but with Duvel, the mouth-taste is essential. Its full, and almost chewy. I get a yeasty taste throughout the beer as well. This beer is simply marvelous.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,MediocreatBest,4.16,"I bought a gift set that included the Duvel glass, and let me say, this beer looks dead sexy sitting in it's own glass. Golden in color with a bit of roange and a giant white clumpy head with tiny bubbles surging towards the top in a column in the middle of the glass. It smells like freshly cut grass and pears, and though it doesn't really make sense, it smells like it's color. It tatses like i'd think grass would with a touch of peper. the carbonationa nd alcohol burn on the outside edge of the tounge a bit and the aftertaste is lemony with other cirtus characteristics.The head lingers for a long time. It is thin in the mouth but the carbonation really gives it a fuller feal. While you can taste hints of the 8.5% abv, it adds to teh beer, and overall youwouldn't think the abv was that high making it quite drinkable. I probably drink this beer slower then most, a definate sippin' beer because the flavor burst on your tounge with each small sip, and as it warms the pear/cirtus flavor comes out more and the slight peppery flavor disapears. I think pepper might be the wrong word but i can't think of how else to describe that flavor.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,govtmule,4.59,"Poured into Duvel tulip glass that came in the 4 pack. Wonderful pillowy white head about 2 or 3 inches thick.

Smelled floral, spcies, some alcohol. I liked the beautiful strong aroma.  Tasted an array of spices. I thought I detected some grapefruit.

222,695,DPMomutant,4.29,"I poured slowly...very slowly...and got a 3 inch head (admittedly not in the recommended type of glassware). Very creamy, very sticky, and a good portion of this just will not go away. Body is a cloudy golden, a bit lighter than I expected....why do I think it won't taste that way?  The smell is quite spicy, and that's a good thing. A great combination indeed.  That spiciness really comes out in the taste. Almost covers the alcohol. Very little bitterness at the end with an unmistakable white grape aftertaste.  This doesn't feel bad going down. A bit more carbonated than I would like. The alcohol is a bit noticeable in the warming feeling you get about 15 seconds after each sip.  This is my 4th beer tonight and the other 3 were not particularly big. Halfway through this I start to notice. Makes me think I probably shouldn't have too many of these even though I could.  This is becoming quite available in this area so I think I'll be picking some up as the occasional nightcap.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,TagoMago,4.63,"Presentation: 33 cl. stubby bottle poured into Scaldis tulip glass.  Appearance: This pours with the biggest head I've ever seen in a beer. It takes several minutes to pour, though well worth the wait. Patience is a virtue. The beer has a very beautiful, pale yellow color, with some yeast cloudiness. The head retention is superb and super creamy, and a nice lacing coats the glass, lasting well after the beer itself is gone.  Smell: Spice and yeast with some fruity (citrus) overtones.  Taste: This beer is very crisp, yet smooth, and has a nice, rather refreshing effervescence. Up front tartness with sweet, citrusy fruit. The finish is quite dry and a bit spicy.  Overall: This is one amazing beer, and it deserves all the credit it receives. This beer is incredibly drinkable with its deceptive 8.5% alcohol content. This beer looks beautiful when poured.

Aroma of yeasty malts and spices greet the nose hairs - nothing overpowering, yet inviting. Taste is fairly clean for a belgian. Starts off very clean and carbonated, then the flavors kick in . Slight tropical fruitiness along with a slight bready malt. All flavors are subtle here. A nice fine carbonation holds this together. slight hoppy finish to keep things dry.

Breadiness, fruity (grapes, plums, various unnamed exotic fruits), and you can definitely smell the spicy hops used in the brew. Taste is equally impressive: still very bready, but there is so much more. This is a very spicy brew, in part, I would think, because of the hops, but also I seem to taste plums, grapes, and maybe coriander?. There is some alcohol heat as well, but it is not overpowering as in some other belgian brews. I understand now why there are so many proponents of this beer. A fine one indeed.

Wonderful ale, great drinkability.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Foxman,4.03,"It pours a cloudy, vivid lemonade yellow, enlivened by carbonation. A hellacious many fingers of pillowy white head swells and stays a long, long time. the anticipated Brussels lace adorns the glass.  In the aroma, a light, mellow malt sweetness wafts in along with a credible note of coriander. A tangy yeast sourness finishes along with a rounded doughy kicker.  Upon sipping, a gentle malt sweetness surfaces first in the flavor as well. A mild lemony tide, ever so slightly acerbic, mingles with a playful spicy nature. A yeasty sourdough tang nips the palate almost whimsically. An understated but veritable alcohol presence glides on through the middle. A vague sour undertone lingers at the finish. Overall, the sum flavor profile is fuller than any individual component.  Slightly more than light bodied, it coats nicely, and the flavors left behind leave sensations as they fade.  ""Pleasant"" pretty much sums it up, and while not amazing, pleasant works real well. The individual pieces are light in nature but they combine to flesh out a lively identity. The ABV is real and present, maybe the most substantial of the separate elements, and you have to regard it, but the full flavor and effervescence make it nicely drinkable. So even if it doesn't floor me, I'd never feel cheated while I'm drinking one.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,GeoffFromSJ,4.43,"A beer well-deserving of a very good reputation. Poured from a 14 oz. bottle into a tulip Duvel glass. A truly exceptional appearance. Nice gold color with a creamy white head which lasts a while. When it does go down, it maintains a pretty thick lace. The smell and taste are intertwined. You can just smell the spicy, fruity Belgian yeast esters. The taste definitely has those. It reminds me of Grand Cru's I have tried. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth. And honestly, that is a hard category for me to rank. The esters, while they make for a very good taste, it reduces its drinkability for me. A truly great beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,DaveGood,4.6,"Duvel poured a nice pale golden yellow with a large white head that had an incredible amount of staying power. When it finally diminished, it left a nice lacing all the way around. The smell was a nice spicy aroma with hints of citris. The taste was fairly sweet with citris flavors on the front end and a little bit of a peppery kick to it on the tail end. The carbonation made the mouthfeel failry light and gave it an almost champagne-like quality to it. Overall the drinkabilty is remarkably high as it is a very smooth beer. Of course, that can be quite dangerous due to the alcohol content. This is definitely one of the best beers that I have had the privilege of drinking and I recommend it to any and everyone.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Head was composed of small bubbles in a large white setting. It then settled down and left a sticky, sugary, cotton-candy look on the side of the glass. Aroma was very clean, fresh, and floral. The flavor was very nicely balanced among all elements. No flavors jumped out at me, it wasn't too sweet, too hoppy, too anything. But it was good!

The taste is a smooth yeast, citrus and banana flavor at first, very similar to a hefe weizen. Quickly, the hops and the alcohol give you a strong kick and the taste becomes way more aggressive, with a thick mouthfeel and a dry long lasting floral hoppy aftertaste. I like how this beer combines two very different feelings and tastes, and how the change in taste is very sudden and kind of unexpected. After a while, the two distinct aspects mix together to form this beer's unique character. Very nice.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,mwrseeley,4.18,"The thing that impresses me most about this beer is its appearance. I am not talking about the colour, which is attractive, but about the incessantly rising bubbles that replenish and form the head.  The aroma is a pleasant combination of oranges and lemon working in conjunction with a yeast-induced light clove and banana aspect. The taste is initially sweet and finished slightly bitter.  I could easily detect the strong presence of alcohol on the palate.  Duvel may very well be an acquired taste. It reminded me, to be honest, of a beer that had been crossed with cognac or brandy.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,rajendra82,4.83,"Pale yellow body that is initially clear and displays an onrush of carbonation reminiscent of Champagne. Outrageously sized head is at least four inches tall, with a full two inches of it standing up on its own outside the goblet I poured it in. Once I poured in the yeast, the body became substantially hazy looking, quite similar to a Hefeweizen. The aroma is like ripening tropical fruits with no detectable alcohol smell. Taste is very refreshing with bananas in the main flavor profile. There are also notes of sourness in the taste like a Lambic. The mouthfeel is silky sooth, enhanced by the tiny carbonation bubbles. There is no way to guess the strength of the beer unless you look it up or feel it going to your head. What a masterful work of art!  P.S.. - I finally bought the glass pack to enjoy Duvel in a tulip, and it made quite a difference. The carbonation was good before, but now there are a ton of bubbles constantly streaming up from the D etched on the bottom of this glass. If you ever are looking to buy a tulip style glass, this is the best way to get two of them for a great price and see a demonstration of the magic they do on a beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Crosling,4.25,"I had read that the pour was crucial and to be honest, I fucked it up a little. The head exploded and now stands before me, appearing like a mountain sitting almost 3 inches above the glass. We will be referring to him as Mount Duvel. He is slowly subsidding and turning quite ugly, developing lumps and hairy mumps. The ground beneath Mount Duvel is sinking and Mount Duvel is gaining more strength and more power. Do I dare put my nose near this thing?  As I put my nose near the glass, I hear a monumental explosion. Suddenly, chunks of bubble gum, lemon drops, pears and peppers come spewing out.  Without warning Mount Duvel destructs and the tasting begins.  The flavor is surely not overwhemling but still has its many strongpoints. Very spicy and peppery with some pineapple, green apples and pear. The finish is well hopped but somewhat lacking only leaving a banana/clove spicyness and then quickly it scampers away. The high carbonation definately affects the mouthfeel.  Very good beer though.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,AllThingsNinja,4.21,"A 330 ml bottle served in one of the Duvel tulip's included within the gift pack poured up to three fingers of light, sculptable foam. There was good retention, and ample Belgian lace. The aroma was dominated by alcohol, and strong spicy scents. The flavors were well balanced and earthy with grain, spicy, and hints of the strong alcohol. It's a smooth drinkable beer, that I will enjoy again.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,fdrich29,4.48,"330ml bottle from a gift set that included two tulip glasses. Best before 9/2006.  The head on this one looked like the top of a rootbeer float, thick, rich and very creamy. The head started out three fingers and settled down nicely to about a quarter inch. Lacing circled the top of the glass, towards the mid point the lacing formed clumps around the glass.  Smells strongly of alcohol and grain. A lot of carbonation feel in the mouth with a smooth, sweet taste that arises after a moment.  Extremely light and drinkable. I'd still grab a Fin before this, but I have a newfound respect for this Belgian Golden and look forward to drinking the other three bottles in my fridge.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Trentonator,3.65,"What a head! This thing looked like a junior high science class volcano project, the head was a good inch above the rim of the glass, with no spillage. The initial taste had some bite to it, you know this beer has some serious ETOH. I liked the smooth taste and mouthfeel, it had a bit of a rubbing alcohol aroma to it though. Overall, I liked this beer, just didn't fall in love with it.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,slushthelush,2.8,This beer looked very good going into the glass. It had a great white head on it. The aroma was very noticable. This was the first time I have ever experienced a Belgian Strong Ale. I guess I just don't care for the sour aftertase which I believe is typical of the style. I am sure it is a great beer it's class. It is just not for me.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Shaw,4.2,"The cork on my 750 mL bottle of Duvel blasted off like a rocket across my kitchen and bounced off the wall almost five feet away. I consider that a fortutious sign.  This ale is a brillant golden color with a large frothy super-white head and tons of carbonation. The head does shrink a bit but it leaves a lot of lace on the glass.  Duvel smells of grain (not quite malt) and alcohol. No hop aroma.  I can't believe I've been enjoying this style of beer without knowing that Duvel is the original Belgian strong pale ale. Shame on me. Well of course Duvel tastes good. It is crisp and sharp with noticable alcohol. I'd say the flavor is a bit more subtle than Lucifer, another one of my favorites in this style.  The mouthfeel is super bubbly, what with all the carbonation. Duvel practically explodes with fizziness in my mouth. It also has a fairly light body with a bit of slickness from the alcohol.  Overall a very good beer. If you enjoy La Fin Du Monde, Rare Vos and others, try the ale that inspired 'em all.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,99bottles,4.63,"Purchased a few 33 cL bottles of this for a bargain. I brought them home and whipped out the Duvel tulip glasses, which are the only way to drink this beer. This guy pours out a beautiful pale golden color, and has the most incredible fluffy white head billow atop of the beer. There's instructions on how to pour it so that it does that too. Just in case. The smell is of active little hop, some citrus, small fermented esters. The taste is wonderful. Can something be rich and light? It glides easy, with clean feel. Again, light citrus and hop prescence with a very clean malt to give structure. Interesting spice notes play with the body of the beer. No way you'd know about its high ABV. This is the best looking beer on the planet, and among the best tasting. They're not just being cocky when the last of the pouring instructions tells you ""Enjoy perfection.""",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,luigi205,4.92,"This beer is my all time favorite. It pours frothy. Has a wonderful aroma and taste. It is a heavy beer, so I wouldn't recommend it with a big meal.

222,695,rdrummer,4.47,"A hazy, pale, golden ale with a large white head and vigorous carbonation. This smells great with a peppery maltiness and some spiciness underlaying it. The aroma is evident as soon as the bottle is opened. The taste is a clean, malty ale with almost no bitterness, and a hint of sweetness. There are spices present that I have a hard identifying but this is a powerful elixir. It has a clean, bubbly feel in the mouth and then the alcohol hits. It is excellent from the first drop to the last. It gets more drinkable as it warms up. The only drawback is my inability to drink more than one due to the alcohol content, but I'll be back tomorrow.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,ark57,4.48,"It is a clear, pale golden color with a big, fluffy head. The aroma has some delicate hops with a touch of citrus. It is smooth and light. The finish is a spicy, crisp dryness.

222,695,soper2000,4.66,750 ml corked and caged bottle Let me preface this by saying this is my favorite beer. It pours to a crisp golden hue which is protected by a massive white head. Champagne like bubbles rapidly race to the surface of this beer. Aroma is of spice but with some notes of yeast. The taste is clean and yeasty but balanced well with some spicey aftertaste. I thought the 750 ml bottle had less hoppiness than I am used to in the 33 cl bottles. The same duvel character remained though. Mouthfeel is exceptional as this beer goes down creamy and bubbly. Drinkability is also amazing considering the massive alcohol content of this brew. I wish I could have more than a couple of these in a night and still feel fine the next morning. This beer is a true masterpiece in my mind.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Dmann,3.85,"Very interesting beer. This one poured a pale yellow color with a really nice frothy white head that left little specks of lace down the glass. The smell was quite unique, with a slightly bitter apple scent and a grainyness to it as well. The taste was quite dry like champagne but with better flavor. The apple scent came out slightly in the flavor but I mostly detected a peppery spice which was very nicely paired with the bubbly mouthfeel. This is definanlty not a beer that I could drink all of the time, but I think it would pair well with many meals and would convert some wine and champagne lovers to beer as well.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,ColForbin,4.63,"Duvel pours with a giant head that takes a long long time to diminish. Almost whipped cream-like. The beer is a cloudy golden color. Nose is full of hops and spice. Taste is very bitter, with some finishing sweetness with a slight bready flavor. A true classic, served best cold unlike most Belgians.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,sulldaddy,4.06,"I pour this into the logo tulip glass that I acquired with the beers. THe brew is a very clear yellow similar to a pilsner in appearance. The head is bleached white and foams up easily. Fades very slowly and looks almost marshmallowy as it settles. I have one column of bubbles rising in the center of the glass this seems almost planned. Aroma is some bready yeast scents, pepery hops, maybe some cloves and a hit of alcohol too. First sip gives me rather sharp bubbly carbonation and average body. The flavor improves as it warms with a slight sweet malt flavor first, some general spiciness in the middle, and a crisp mild hop finish. Verysmooth and drinkable and no taste of the 8.5%.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,sprackops,4.48,"11.2oz capped bottle  Appearance: This one rushed out of the bottle with an enormous head that began to fizzle out after about five minutes. I left most of the yeast in the bottle. In the Duvel tulip it looks simply spectacular - bright gold with columns of carbonation rising to the top in a manner which appears much more controlled than other beers. This is supposedly an effect created by notches on the bottom of the glass. A very elegant effect.  Smell: Quite complex, with hints of coriander, pepper, yeast and various fruits from apples to citrus dominating at different times while enjoying the glass. Very nice.  Taste: Starts off sweet with a bit of yeast in background, balanced by a gentle but assertive tartness. The presence of crisp apple from before returns here, subtly obscured by the sweetness of candi sugar, coriander and herbal hops. The ABV is hidden very well. Perfect dry finish.  Mouthfeel: This is probably the creamiest pale beer I've had the pleasure of trying. Not nearly as heavy as something like an imperial stout, but this beer certainly has a unique presence. Level of carbonation is perfect for the style, in my opinion.  Drinkability: I could see people easily drinking themselves into stupors with this without realizing it. This makes for as easy drinking as a nice pilsner or wit, though it loses some points here as the ABV makes this one a poor session beer.  Before I had this one I'd heard it described as ""beer crossed with champagne"", and while that's a fine description for a layman, I'd have to say it's much better than that. I'd keep this one around 365 days a year if the price was right. Certainly in my top 20.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Crystal clear, pale straw color w/ a billowing bright white head that drapes and blakets the cruve of the goblet. Steady streeams of carbonation rocket to the top from the etched 'D"" in the bottom. Aroma is clean; light and spritzy - hints of vanilla , lemon zest and fresh rolls. Sharp, saazy hop up front- tart and lemony. A bit of carb bite on the tongue gives way to medium bodied malt with a hint of melon sweetness. Then the hop takes charge w/ warm, peppery bittering through the finish. Mellow, long, lingering dry aftertaste. I bet this bottle would have been better w/ another year in the cellar. Classic Belgian Golden Ale.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,RootedFool,4.83,"Purchased a stubby bottle (just under 12 ounces) from the North Coast Co-op in Arcata, California.  Gigantic head -- fluffy, bright cloudy white. I've never seen lacing like this -- globs of foam literally clinging to the glass long after the head recedes!  Smell is of spices (corriander, pepper corns) encompassed by the sweetness of malts. A very big smell here. I also pick up on candied cherries and grapefruit rinds submerged in sugar.  Taste is a dense spicy maltiness, followed by a peppery hop and alcohol aftertaste. Quite rich and rewarding after waiting for the massive head to recede. Mouthfeel is heavy enough to deal with these big, bright flavors.  This beer deserves the hype!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,claytri,4.18,"Duvel poured a cloudy effervesent light gold with two fingers of white head. It had an aroma of malt, fruit and flowers. The taste was sharp with hints of malt and good hop bite to it, a finish that had a mint and bananna taste to it. It was well bodied with a honeyish feel to it. This is a fine beer and the taste and body make you want to drink it in volume, the bite though encourages a little slower pace.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,JamesBerry,4.47,"Pale pour, with a monstrously large head (the bottle's ""Pour Unhurriedly"" caveat was no lie). Classic ""Belgian"" aroma: light and airy, yet bold and fairly spicy. There was a rather pleasing taste of bananas and fruit. Smooth, medium body. Slightly sour aftertaste.

Not in your face, but sniff it again and there is so much there!  Taste... subtle again. Think honey. Tobacco. Spice. (But all in the background). I want more. And more.  As for the texture... yes it's creamy, yeasty, thick and sooo refreshing.  I don't criticise but, much as you would like to, you just can't drink this stuff all day.

222,695,Ieatlambfries,4.41,"Well, mine had a white label and a tag explaining that this is the new label. But I'm assuming it's still the same great Ale.  The appearance was superior. A hazy bright gold, with a huge 3 finger white head of large bubbles. The head retained for almost the entire drinking experience. When the head did begin to recede a bit it left great lacing, picture perfect. In fact I just changed my appearance rating to 5. The smell was good. Very yeast filled and musty. It only lost points due to the alcohol which overpowered the others a bit. The taste was also exceptional. Grains, musty yeast, and some spiciness and alcohol in the background. I didn't taste the fruit notes in the middle that some have described, but I only had one. Alas, maybe next time. Mouthfeel was very good as well. Very carbonated, bubbles looked like they were being powered by a small motor. Extremely crisp. Drinkability was excellent as well. I wish I had more than one.

222,695,Quaffer,4.16,"11.2 oz. Bottle  Appearance: Damn, Duvel always looks greats, especially sitting in a Duvel tulip glass. This beer poured a hazy, pale yellow with a stark white head that lept up out of the liquid. It easily reached over three fingers, even with a careful, down-the-side-of-the-glass pour. As it settled, it gave new meaning to the word rocky. It became an uneven landscape of dense, white foam and coarse bubbles. It took a very long time to dissipate, and never really disappeared since it was being fed from below by the ""bead from hell."" The streams of bubbles were so strong and numerous that it seemed as though gas was being forcibly injected into the bottom of the beer. An incredible amount of sticky lace was left behind. Beers just don't look any better than this.  Smell: Right after the pour, the aroma was a combination of fruit and spice (mainly pepper and coriander), with notes of yeast. As the head settled, some alcohol rose up to join the other smells, along with a light graininess. Also at this time, the fruitiness evolved into an aroma that was very apple-like.  Mouthfeel: For the amount of carbonation that was present in this beer, it was relatively smooth. There was a tingle on the tongue, but not nearly what I expected. It was thin-bodied and very dry, leaving me wanting more as soon as the beer had left my mouth.  Taste: Overall, the flavor was light and continued to build from the moment that the beer hit the tongue up through the aftertaste. Upfront, there was a fruity sweetness that became even sweeter (but not cloying) as the flavor progressed. Hints of malt and yeast flitted about upfront, with the malt flavor developing into the finish. There was a very light alcohol spiciness on the finish as well, but it was not as strong as one would expect from 8.5% abv in a relatively light beer. This beer could definitely sneak up and bite you if you aren't careful!  It has been quite awhile since I have had the oppurtunity to drink a Duvel. It disappeared from the Wichita market a number of years ago. It was one of my favorites in my early days of drinking real beer, and I am glad to see that my opinion has not changed. I do think that I like the larger bottles better, though. Not sure why, but they just seem to have a little more flavor and a little less dryness.  A big thanks to noclueaboutbeer for hauling this one out to Kansas all the way from Connecticut.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,moulefrite,4.38,"Ahhhh, very good indeed. This beer has a classic feel to it that lives up to its classic status. The color is rather deceiving with its rather pale golden color. It looks much lighter than it truly is. The head is quite nice-good and sticky, snowy white and long lived. Aromas are fairly complex and inviting-malty, somewhat anteseptic and spice driven with some citrusy hop notes as well. The mouth feel is damn nice! Refreshing with good dryness and medium to full body, this is a solidly balanced drink-never flabby or sticky. Flavors are classic in that they cleanse with a sweet/spicy clove-corriander? and, banana like flavor much like a German Hefe, while at the same time offering Belgium richness and complexity which kicks the beer up a notch. This is like a Hefe Squared! Interesting how easy this beer is to drink-remarkable really! I will be re-visiting this brew with food very soon as it seems to offer great potential.

Smell consists of mainly yeast with some alcohol, but not much. Taste is out of this world. Starts out with some of that alcohol kick, but it's very well hidden with the yeast then finishes off with some apples/pears. 8.5% is a little to laugh at, you can't taste it at all.

Very mild flavored, not too sweet at all. It .has a bit of woody tartness in the finish.  This is much drier than most Belgian strong pale ales. There is a bit of spice and fruitiness in this, but it is hard to pin down the exact taste.  Extremely pleasant! Taste more like ""Beer"" than most Belgian beers of this type, I really like it.  Mouthfeel is thicker than you would expect for such a pale colored beer. It is just about right, satisfying but no sensation that you need to chew it.  Drinkability is very good!

The taste starts off fruity almost of green apples and turns to a bite of bitter in the end with a lasting aftertaste and a strong mouthfeel.

I only worked the cork a little bit and it came flying out. I didn't hear it land, and I still don't know where it went.  Appearance: Very very very light in color, but I wouldn't say that is bad. It was a little too clear for my liking though. Most people were gravitating toward this just because of the lighter color. The head was soft and ultra-white. I almost thought I poured a glass of champagne.  Smell: Nothing surpising. There was mainly a midrange fruity smell with a bit of a sharp edge.  Taste: Nice. Not utterly spectacular but definitely good. I was expecting more of something, but I don't know what. The flavors seemed toned down in a way. My brother said it tasted like a white, but I don't agree with that.  Mouthfeel: Bubbly and a little tangy.  Drinkability: Yes.

Initial taste is all fruit and sugar sweetness, but then a rich roasted malt quality begins to appear, followed by alcohol warmth. Finishes with long lasting sticky sweetness.  All in all a very intriguing ale. Champagne like in it's appearance and carbonation, but a malt monster at the same time. Amazing something that looks this light is so full of flavor.

The head last forever and will dwindle down to a never-ending white lace.The color is a bit hazy with the yeast mixed in. The aroma is of wet hay, grasses, and malt. There is a bit of yeast mixed in the aroma and a mild hint of fresh green grapes. Clean crisp taste awaits your taste buds. Yeast, hops and malt all combine to make and enjoyable statement on your tongue. There is a bit of alcohol present but I thought I makes its present, ever so slightly at the end.

Sweet candi sugar and musty hops with accents of spicy yeast and a completed fermentation. Citrus notes and black pepperiness, not unlike Orval. Tastes complex like a sneak attack on your tastebuds; sweet and dry, tart and zingy. Effervescent like you would not believe, bubbly to the tongue. Beautiful tight lacing in glass. It's complexity makes it one of the best beers in the world, whereas the recipe history stated that Duvel was initially formulated to compete with the growing pilsner boom of the 30s and 40s.

Smell: Crisp citrus, grapefruit, yeasty(slight must)/crackery, sweet candy malt and floral hop notes. Taste: Smooth, light-medium bodied sweet toffee malt, almost lager-like. Crisp carbonation and gentle floral/citrus hops dry the mouth when suddenly the cheeks and tongue start to numb with alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel: Velvety and light.

222,695,Jason,4.68,"330 ml stubby brown bottle with a best before date of 09 2006. Quick tips on how to pour the beer as well as Bottle Conditioned on the label.  Appearance: A perfect amount of foamy head from a trained pour into the appropriate Duvel glass, the lace clings to the glass in patchy clumps. The clarity is great as the pouring went well and the yeast stayed in the glass. Very pale in colour, some would confuse this with a lager as far as the light golden hue.  Smell: Hints of apple skin (juicy fruit), clean alcohol and a slight yeast bite in the aroma.  Taste & Mouthfeel: Clean pale malt flavour throughout. Three big flashes of yeast, hop bitterness and alcohol hit the palate. Big cleansing crispness makes you want an other sip. A tad juicy in the middle, with a big warming alcohol landing middle to end. Mild medicinal phenols peak in the middle and nearly vanish as the alcohol takes over.  Notes: A top shelf brew, this one does it for me and then some. Pretty much sex in a bottle and the devil told me to drink it. Duvel is close to dry champagne but so much more. Between the bitterness and the sheer crispness, this beer is what I expect from the Belgian strong pale ale style.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Sammy,4.2,"A pleasant beer in every sense: interesting bottle, light hazy color, nice head. Pleasant taste not overpowering. Found it a bit creamy and sweet and not overly dry, but higher than average alcohol does affect mouthfeel. perhaps it was my batch or the chemistry changes depending on storage and age. Nice with food and would have another anytime.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,BierManVA,3.13,"I'm a bit disappointed with this one. Not quite what I expected. Not a bad bier mind you, just disappointing for the price.  Very light color with heavy carbonation. The smell and taste are just not there in my opinion. Very weak. La Fin du Monde is by far a more superior style of this bier. And for the price as well.  Disappointing....",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Andreji,4,"Even though this is a very good beer, I did expect it to be a little better.  Pours a golden but not completely translucid tone with carbonation that runs up only through the center of the glass- an interesting image- and builds up a creamy and sparkling white head that lasts longer than expected.  The smell, a mixture of wheaty/ malty contrasts with some soury ingredients, makes it certainly complex. But what you dont identify here and that perhaps I found somewhat reppeling was that the tasting, as you progress, you find the alcohol being ever more perceivable. That held me back from another one and left me a bit disappointed, but not enough to undermine its overall quality.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,JustinBathurst,3.58,"This beer was recommended to me by a friend whose beer tastes I trust quite a bit. What I discovered was that this particular kind of beer is not for me. Quite a lovely appearance, especially in a nice duvel abbey glass, and not bad just before dessert (but of course after a meal, good lord not on an empty stomach).  Everything seemed to agree with me until I actually tasted it--far too full of a spirits-like aftertaste for me. Not my thing, but pretty interesting nonetheless.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Charthepirate,4.15,"Even though it's a strong ale it screams Hefewiezen.  Not an attractive color when poured, but the big billowy head is a work of art. The head seems to stay and stay in these big gorgeous clumps till your last sip.  Smell is spicy and wheaty.  Flavor hits like a hefewiezen at first, but right away some citrus, pepper and a variety of other flavors. The peppery bite will catch you off guard. Finally a warming sensation from the alcohol. Not my favorite style, but I can see how this beer is so fantastically rated.  Its peppery bite is the most defining characteristic on the mouth.

Pepper in the aroma and taste - thats the alcohol coming through, and coming through right, some spice, green apple and lemon. The hops remind me of hops from a lager not an ale.

Pours a cloudy yellow under a huge and billowing white head that takes its sweet time to settle. Nice lace, but the liquid is just too pale for my taste. The smell is pleasant - pepper and spice. The mouth is way too carbonated and heavy with sweetness. The bubbles actually hurt the tongue and palate. I'll concede that there is a lot of complex tastes here, but none of them is really what I want in a beer - standard francophone sweetness, a bit of pepper and clove, very little in the way of malt, and practically no hops.

222,695,ToneControl,4.35,"This is a very strong, warming beer, but it is very drinkable.  Since my homebrewing days, I have always decanted live beers into a jug before pouring into the glass, so as to avoid disturbing the sediment. For me, this help reduce carbonation a little, to a degree that pleases me. Done this way, Duvel is crystal clear after just 2 days in the fridge.  OK, this is a classic, it's hard to get this strength in a balanced drinkable beer (unless you already appreciate strong treacley lagers such as Special brew/Elephant beer, and the Scottish super lagers). It has a very round taste, and for me the hops don't really appear. I assume they are there as a balance, but they don't really stand out compared to some of my other favourites. I agree, in a way the mouthfeel is a little like champagne (as mentioned in various reviews here), but since I drink more Duvel than champagne, I'd say it was the other way round!  Since it's so easy to find this beer, you should really try it out.  After reading another reviewer's comments about drinking it with a chilli, I may try it with a curry - although most Brits drink lagers with currys, I have heard recently from some Indians that red wines work well, so I guess a really heavy beer might also do the trick",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Nose features aromas of herbal hops, yeast, mild spice, fruit and maybe a touch of candy sugar. Taste is complex, round, and quite enjoyable. The yeast character never strays far, while notes of passion fruit, apricot, sweet malt, candy sugar and spice lead to a zesty hop kick on the finish. Effervescent mouthfeel lends itself well to this beer's overall characteristics. Incredibly drinkable for an 8.5% ale, Duvel is something else. Truly a favorite, this is the beer that morphed me into a Belgian ale fan. Wonderful stuff and a must-try.

I ordered it at the Other Side Cafe in boston with a bowl of chili and was in heaven.  The huge head caught me off guard, but the duvel glass allowed the beer to be drunk without me ending up with a face full of foam. The little ""tornado"" of bubbles from the base of the glass is great, too.  This beer feels like champagne in the mouth- nice tight carbonation. The floral, hoppy flavors show little of the high alcohol content of this ""devil"".

Fine balance of belgian hops and malts, light fruitiness, more citrus than sweet. Spices present themselves, but not in memorable fashion. The mouthfeel is crisp and micro-bubbly, as much as any champange. It imposes itself and therefore detracts, on the flavor a bit. Tastes present are citrus malts, genuine Belgian hops, apple, and coriander. Even at 8.5% you have to search for alcohol flavor, which is dangerous if put in the wrong hands.

All the stars were lined up.  The bottle hadn't been in my possession very long, but it must have been rather old. The beer was rather dull and fizzy.

Pure citrus all around. Interesting. The taste is much the same, pure fizzy citrusy beer. Hints of lime. But then, I suppose a lot of fruit once fermented could taste limey.  ABV of 8.5% however.

Initial pour was a perfectly clear gold with an agressive white head that fills the remainder of the glass. As I swirled the bottle and decanted the yeast sediments (which is my personal preference), liquid gold turned into hazy apricot. Aromas are sweet and spicy--bananas and cloves perhaps and there is some grain in there to hold it all together. The first sip is an arsenal of spicy fruit flavors with a nice bite from the carbonation and alcohol as if the beer is reminding you show respect where its due. Everything becomes extremely balanced and much more mellow as I take a few more sips, which is where the deception begins.

This reminds me of being 12-years-old and wanting to shave so bad that one day I went into the bathroom while my dad was at work and lathered a can of shaving cream on my face.  I haven't touched the beer yet. I feel so unnecessary.  This would be nice in a flute; more effervescent than champagne. The head needs to be controlled (or paroled). It's like pouring from a tap that's gone haywire. And having to sit around for ten minutes while this thing settles sucks. Straw golden body like an American lager, hazy but a good deal of light comes through -- Los Angeles in June.  All hops on the nose -- spicy, cidery, sharp. Is this a Belgian or a Pilsner?  Tastes like a smoky hefe. Very clean, lagery, with mild gumball from the yeast and some alcoholic exhaust. The strong hop aroma is all but lost on the tongue with only a minor tang that immediately fades out. Sweet and malty (creamy indeed), but where's my Saaz?

222,695,Loki,4.53,"Sampled from a 33cl bottle at Falstaff in Paris and served with the proper Duvel glass. Hmm....neon Duvel sign in 1st floor window, I wonder who provided the glasses?  I have to say I had no idea what to expect from this beer. I didn't know what style it was, only that it was highly rated and I hadn't had it.  Poured a golden pilsner yellow with a volcanic eruption of head that did not allow you to empty the bottles contents in one effort even using proper form. Tiny streams of bubbles in the beer. The creamy white head was very pillowy and looked much like a fluffy white cloud on a beautiful North Carolina summer day. The head retention was very long (as I was trying to pour the rest of the beer in the glass) and the lacing was quite impressive as well.  The aromas were fairly muted at first, then came alive quite quickly. Scents of fruit, yeast, candied malt, and then hints of spice and hops. Very inticing and a little surprising, I would not expect such candied malt scents from such a light colored beer. If I smelled this blind I would have guessed its color more in the range of a Triple or a caramel color.  The taste was just as surpising as the aromas, but along the same lines. Full and rich the flavor started with candied malt and some sweet fruit. The middle started to become dry and slightly hoppy, but finished very crisp and clean. The alcohol is very well hidden, but you can note its pressence. The alcohol profile complements this beer and I don't think the flavor profile would be complete without it.  The body was light to medium light with amazing effervescences and carbonation that dances on the tongue and tickles the throught. The carbonation is very close to that of a good Brut (dry) champagne. This beer was as good cold as it was when it warmed. It did not last long enough to get to warm, but we were sitting outside and it was 93 at midnight, so it did warm some.  A wonderful beer that I cannot wait to experience again.

222,695,RoyalT,4.38,"Appearance  Very light colored (yellow) for a BSPA. The head is monstrous even with a conservative pour. I emptied the bottle in my glass, went upstairs to watch the top half of a Mariners inning, came back downstairs, and it was still there.  Smell  A complex aroma. I can pick up some fruit, malt, and yeast. Pleasant.  Taste  The light appearance is deceptive. This is a heavy hitter, and its not just malt, yeast, and light fruit. You have to wait for it, but theres nice spicy bitterness and even some evident hops past the crest of the standard BSPA flavors.  Not to go overboard, but this is a good brew. It is fun and complex. I know that it is sold at thousands of grocery stores around the country and I may sound like a bumpkin for belaboring the point, but The Devil is very interesting indeed. I have often dismissed it myself in the past (thinking of it in the 3.0 or 3.5 area), until I actually sat down and took some time with it for the review.  Mouthfeel  Again, this is right on. Well carbonated and smooth.  Drinkability  The bottle didnt even make it to the end of the review. So what if half the Bud-drinking losers you know have it in their fridge's  its great!  Comments  I really developed an appreciation and respect for this beer after taking my time with it. This is well done.  PS: Large amounts of sediment that I'm not supposed to drink - but I do.

A very foamy white head, lots of carbonation. Poured a straw color into my Chimay goblet (so I don't have a Duvel glass - sue me!). Scents of sweet fruits and honey. Taste of honey and bananas, and a nice crisp zap of hoppiness that keeps it from being too cloying. Definitely did not notice the high amount of alcohol, so this would probably have led me to dance in the middle of the street if I had a large supply of them on hand. I'll have to get my wine snob old man to drink this as part of my ongoing campaign to get him to respect beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,nkmu,4.4,"I had a glorious 750mL bottle all to myself several nights ago, and I now have a new favorite. One thing that struck me most about this beer was the perfect level of carbonation-- I can't really explain it, but I want--nay, need!-- to feel it again. The main taste to me was of fruit, specifically apples. Maybe that's just me though...  I was raving to my girlfriend about the beer, and told her i could think of nothing i wanted to do more than sit in a dark, silent room while drinking a bottle of Duvel. she suggested something she could do to me in that room that would improve the experience-- yep, it's still my wildest *beer* fantasy. time to make the 45 minute trip it takes to buy more!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Sixpack595,4.38,"While not quite as pretty as Orval I think it tastes quite a bit better. With chunky white head, clear straw coloring, and a faint, slightly spicy aroma this beer still presents it's self very well. Very crisp with a slight spiciness and a bit of bitterness. Not as sweet as I expected, and very, very drinkable. I found it a much better beer as it warmed, or it could just be the 750ml bottle of 8.5% goodness warming me...either way its a winner!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,far333,3.6,"Reminds me of champagne almost from start to finish. The fizzy white head quickly recedes down to the top of the slightly hazy honey/straw colored beer. Nose is sweet, a bit fruity, with hints of honey. Flavor is also sweet, with hints of honey and candy. Mouthfeel is crisp, a bit tingly. Average drinkability due to sweetness and carbonation.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,BobLuvBeer,4.07,"Pours with a 1 head, Full carbonation and cloudy, yellowish color. Very light in taste, with a bite of hops. Carbonation almost explodes in mouth on first sip. Head remains throughout glass. Strong hop presence. Beer practically floats off the tongue and hops grab onto the sides of cheeks and the flavor lingers there. Excellent amount of lace. As beer warms and settles, hop flavor mellows and the beer seems to thicken up and gains a citrus finish.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,IronDjinn,4.39,"Poured from a sweet looking 330 ml brown bottle, best before date May 2006. Looks like heaven in a glass, slightly hazed golden hue, massive amount of carbonation action (more fun than watching sea monkeys), and a massive chunky white head that stayed all of the way and left some serious lacing. Light citrus aroma, some coriander, a bit of hay. Flavour is very light and subtle at first, considering that this is 8.5% abv, but it all seems to come out in the finish and linger, mostly citrus tones lightly surrounded by spice. Very smooth mouthfeel, deceiving, as the angel on my one shoulder says to stop at one, but the devil on the other side says to go hog wild. This is very, very, very fine ale, all the hype was true.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,WesWes,3.95,"The beer pours a light golden color with a frothy white head that lasts. The nose is fruity with belgian spices. There is a banana smell and a hint of corriander. The taste is good; again with the spices and the fruitiness. This is a good Belgian ale straight from the heart of Belgium. The mouthfeel is a bit too intense. The carbonation reminds me of a few bottle conditioned homebrews that went wrong. The beer is light bodied. It is a good drinking beer and one that I would love to enjoy again, although Ommegang's Hennepin is better.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,euskera,4.2,"750 ML bomber..  Nice woosh when you pop open the cork. Pours our a murky golden blond with one hell of a head, almost cotton candy like. Smell is fruity malt, with apple overtones. Stunningly drinkable, nice medium body with the fruit overtones. This is what a light bodied ale should taste like. I would drink this any day of the week..",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Rumrunner,3.87,11.2 oz. bottle  Pours a very unclear light straw color. A big head which dissipates some but stays until the end. The scent is very green tangy apple. There is some slight pepper and spice as well.  The flavor is strong green apple. There is a slight grassy flavor as well. Very tangy and finishes with a very dry crispsness. A very champagne like finish.  It is smooth with a tiny bite. A very crisp feel in the mouth. Refreshing. A quality ale for a hot day.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,TheDM,3.46,This brew poured an extremely invigorated head of long lasting finely sized white bubbles with an excellent lacing and a cloudy wheat yellow colored body. It has a very mild malt-hop aroma and a flavor of fizzy banana clove and bread. It is a very smooth brew and hides its alcohol content well.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,barleypop,4.62,"I am sure glad I finally got around to trying this one. This is my definite favorite in its style.  The beer rushes to life as you unleash it from the bottle. Once slowly poured, it shows a thick dense head with a golden orange colored body.  The nose is very fruity. Most prevalent to my sniffer was an aroma of lemon,banana and spice.  The fruit comes alive on your tongue with agressive hops and carbonation. Very velvety on the tongue. Excellent finish. I enjoyed this one with a sharp cheddar and it was a nice combination. I can't wait to try this one on tap. Truly a special ale.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,granger10,3.45,"I'm sorry, I know this is supposed to be a great beer but I just did not care for it too much. The head on the pour was too much for me to handle, out of control. At each taste it felt like the beer was turning to foam in my mouth. Because of that mouthfeel dropped. The taste was of a complex fruit sweetness that I did enjoy but nothing special. The balance was not there and the finish seemed too yeasty to me. Give me a Maudite any day over this.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,vitesse,5,served in the famous little 12 oz. black stubby bottle... this beer lived up to every bit of the hype. truly a world class beer. maybe the single greatest all-around beer i've ever tasted. every bit deserving of its huge reputation. perfectly complex and balanced belgian beer flavor. balances sweetness and acidity perfectly. beautiful pale golden color and great thick fluffy head. lots of lace on the glass. just perfect. worth every cent.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,GreatPondBrewer,4.52,"My 100th review. I feel like I am losing my virginity. Forever I will now be branded with a mug, but enough of me lamenting my aging this beer deserves my full attention. I can mope later.  I chose this beer because the first real piece of glass I got was a duvel tulip glass, and now it can finally be put to its proper use. Housing an enrmous head. This head looked like someone had taking a can of whipped cream and just unloaded it into my glass. However, below the frothy, white clouds lay a beautiful straw colored liquid. As the head finally receded it left some of the largest lace I have ever seen. There were huge rings of it all down my glass and it was rocky and bubbly like soap suds.  The smell was of delicate malts that reminded me much of a white wine. Dry and sharp with just a hint of fruity honey. There was just a touch of the yeast to add a more earthy smell.  Tasting this was quite a sensation. It was crisp and refreshing, but it was not overly light by any means. The barest bit of hops and carbonation hit the front of my palette while a malty, bready taste full of honey and green raisins. The final third of the taste was just a little peppery displaying the 8.5%ABV quite nicely as it flowed down my throat. The aftertaste was suprisingly not dry but watering. What an interesting beer.  The mouthfeel was very much like a chardonnay or dryer white wine.  (There is still lace stuck to the top of my glass!)  Overall this is a great beer that I will never turn down. It is light, but at the same time full bodied. It is crisp and refreshing enough to drink on a hot summer day such as this, yet I could easily drink a couple of these on a frosty autumn night. I now join the ranks of true BAs.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Realale,3.93,"Pour a full clear gold, with a huge bright white head composed of very large bubbles. The head settles slowly to a rocky, incomplete 3/4"" cap.  Nose is subtle. Some base bready maltiness, a touch of yeast, and a bit of phenol.  Midweight in the mouth, with a nice round malty feel. It is simply full of malt, and quite yeasty, despite a clean pour. The malt becomes bigger, and the beer more complex as it warms closer to cellar temperature, than fridge temperature. Some earthiness appears, as well as some spiciness. Great soft, fine carbonation from the bottle-conditioning adds a lot of character.  It is a subtle beer, but that can be a very nice thing, as it is here. Small bottle. Best before date of April, 2004.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Jables,3.9,"incredible drinkablitility light, yet strong. The flavor is balanced but the abv is high enough to have you singing by early early evening. This review is from notes. The nose is malty yet I can slightly smell the aromatic hops. The taste is sharp and yeasty , the prototytpical belgian strong ale, but witth hops to boot. The flavor is even and balanced yet strong enough to beat an average beer to a bloody pulp.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,jcalabre,2.91,Originally sampled on 12 October 2002. This review is from my notes. I was underwhelmed by this beer. Pours w/ a big frothy white head; opaque golden color; I really thought that this would be a Grand Cru style of beer. It really wasn't anything special. The taste didn't do much for me.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,taez555,4.7,"The infamous Duvel. Pronounced Do vull, not Do vell. Flemish not french.  tasted it out of an 11.2oz bottle. It poured a HUGE white head with large bubbles that just sat unmoved for several minutes. The body was a bright golden translucent yellow.  The smell of this beer was amazing. A full yeasty smell with a beautiful pear aroma. Almost reminisant of some german weis beers. Lots of fruit and soft spice hints.  The taste of this beer is amazing. Very easy drinking. Waves of flavor. Starting with soft chewy pear and apple fruit flavors, followed by subtle earthy hop aromas that blended well with the fruits. It then finishes with the reemergence of the fruit flavors and lingers off onto the soft bitterness. Almost reminding me of soft melted butter.  This beer is really the epitome of Belgian triples. No wonder it's one of Belgiums biggest selling beers. So complex and yet so light and easy drinking at the same time. It's amazing this beer is 8.5% alcohol. It sneaks up on you slowly, but you'd never notice it while drinking it. An amazing beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,BierReise,4,"Nice looking golden ale with a head white as snow. Interesting aroma, like another rater said almost a buttery aroma. Very smooth and drinkable despite the unnoticable high abv. I've never had this one before but it reminds me of the Urthel I had recently. I also taste a blend of fruit but nothing leaping out at me. This ale gives me a very relaxing feeling and I can see why some have such an affinity for it.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,beergeek279,4.8,"Served from 330 mL bottle. Color poured a pale yellow with a good amount of head. The smell was that of fruit, with a bit of alcohol to it. The taste is fairly dry, almost like brut champagne, and the alcohol is somewhat detectable, but not overwhelming. The mouthfeel is fairly carbonated, with hints of alcohol. As for drinkability, I could drink these as long as I could hold out :) I had heard many good things about Duvel, and having tried it I have to say I heartily agree! Along with its darker cousin Maredsous, this is certainly one of my favorite Belgians!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,assurbanipaul,4.33,"This has always been one of my greatest faves, a fact I've often regretted the next morning. Pours into a thick, sturdy head that takes its time dissipating and leaves good lacing on the sides.  Cloudy in appearance yet bright, clean and crisp in taste. It has a strong and clear nose, sharp, yeasty with a very light citrus. A testament to brewing skill when a brew has an alcohol content this high and you aren't overwhelmed. Sneaks up on you, though.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,SheepNutz,4.43,"I had the Duvel in a 11.2oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. Despite pouring it very slowly, there is still a good 2.5 fingers of fluffy head. The head dies down to about 1.5 fingers, but that's it. There is also a good amount of lacing left on the glass. The color is a pale orange-yellow that is slightly cloudy. The smell is very fruity, mostly banana and citrus. It is very pleasant. The taste is a great blend of fruit, spices, and alcohol. It isn't overly sweet though, there is a good malt/hops balance. The beer has a great strong mouthfeel to it. The drinkability is just a little lower, because the alcohol doesn't seem to be masked, as in other stong ales.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,hotstuff,4.12,This brew poured an extremely large white foamy head. It left an excellent lacing on the sides of my mug. It was observed to have a yellow in body.

222,695,usualpulp,4.47,"Pours a bubbly golden color, with a fluffy white almost creamy looking head. Fruit aroma is very present and can be smelled while pouring. The taste of Duvel is wonderful. Very fruity and hearty tasting, while being quite refreshing at the same time. Its easy to forget that this brew is 8.5% abv. The power of this beer sneaks up on you. Banana flavor is very present here and very well balanced with the cloves and hops. So many flavors stand out, but none of them are too overpowering. Definitely one great Belgian beer, and a must try.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,philipt,4.53,"I was astonished to see that I have not yet reviewed this beer, it being one of best in my book. Duvel is responsible for my love of great beers, particularly Belgians.  Many other brewers try to imitate Duvel, and many reviewers compare other similar beers to Duvel, and for good reason. This is simply one of the best examples of a strong Belgian golden ale.  Perfect appearance. Clear, pale yellow in color (that is until the yeast is roused in the bottle) with a towering, rocky, pillowy, bright white head. Creates substantial lacing. The aroma is malty sweet, candy-ish, estery, and fruity, with a touch of spiciness. The body is incredibly light and smooth, but all the while this is an intriguing and complex ale. The taste is initially sweet, with candy like flavors. Subtle notes of pear and apple complement the sweetness. The sweetness is followed by a fresh hop flavor and spiciness. The alcohol is predominately hidden and the beer finishes slightly dry.  Thanks, Rodney.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,tavernjef,4.48,"Stubby bottle: Unique color of light yellow, very gem-like in character looking much like a sparkling white wine, with lots of bubbly carbonation. The head on this was a monster, an amazing sight to behold, tall, bright bleached white head nearly over three inches. The head is super foamed cream, looking like light styrofoam, or more so, close to a meringue. Upon the first sip, the head barely moves, only where the liquid touches does the head dissolve, leaving huge cliffs of foam clinging on to the glass. I wouldn't even call it lace, it looks just like the origianl head just stuck like glue in marshmellow clumps all around the inside of the glass. Miraculously amazing!  Smell is super zesty clean of light lemon and orange peel and spicy, notes of yeast and sharp hops. A super sniffer and strikingly complex with brightness.  Taste is more of the same, mirrored of the smells, light, smooth, zesty clean and fresh with pops of lemon, orange, yeasty peppered spices, other bright fruits of apple and pineapple all just complexly mixing over the palette and taking it for a ride of enjoyment - finishing strongly twinged of bittering sweetness, zesty clean, and actually somehow smooth. Feels lightish-medium body but packed full of carbonating action with a perfect smooth hold and slightly drying and tart. How'd they do that. So complex in character and flavors its hard to use words to describe it, just drink it and see, you'll become stupified with levels of wonderment.  On another note: after drinking about half my glass I was shocked to see that on the bottle it is labeled 8.5% - that sure doesn't seem to be an effect until its ""after-effect"", so I say its sneaky head swimmingly delicious.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,MJR,4.36,"Appearance: Into it's proper glass, it pours a clear, pale gold with the characteristically massive head that intially takes up more space than the liquid. The head leaves gobs of sticky lace down the inside of the glass. Tons of bubbles race to the top, from the heavy carbonation. A truly classic appearance; if this doesn't rate a 5, nothing does...  Smell: The aroma is quite perfumy with a touch of spiciness, along with a faint fruity sweetness. Hint of bready yeast... A touch of Saaz is in there too.  Taste: Combines both sweetness and spiciness with a nice, firm Saaz bitterness. The sweetness has fruity suggestions of pear and apple, with a touch of honey, while the spiciness has a peppery note. The yeast imparts a touch of breadiness. A bit of a phenolic character shows up later in the finish. Finishes with a light alcohol flavor. Delicious!  Mouthfeel: Light and spritzy with carbonation for days... It's very prickly on the tongue, with a dry mouthfeel.  Drinkability: Suprisingly good considering it's strength. This beer is well known for it's ability to hide it's 8.5%abv. You don't notice how strong it is until it sneaks up on you...  A world classic. I can't add anything that hasn't already been said...",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,johnrobe,4.26,"A classic brew. Every beer lover must try this one. It pours a deep, slightly hazy straw color with a voluminous, champagne-like, brilliant white head. The fruity ester and yeast smells are quite subtle and do not betray the treasure yet to come. Silky smooth, the ""Devil"" comes on in a wave of lightly sweet bready malt combined with a bit of banana and mildly spicy esters. There is no hint of alcohol taste despite the relatively high alcohol percentage (8.5%) making this one of the most aptly named brews around. Deceptively smooth and drinkable, this beer can unleash a stealth attack on your sobriety lest you take care with your pace.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Skywave,4.2,"I liked this beer very much. It had a hoppy and malty sweet ""continental"" aroma. Fluffy white head and hazy golden liquid. The taste is amazing. Soft malt and bready yeast notes with a nice crisp hoppiness. finishes clean and refreshing. This is a strong beer that you could easily mistake for a beer of a more moderate alcohol content. Be careful!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,WVbeergeek,4.5,"Sampled from a 250ml bottle this legendary beer pours a very pale hazy golden hue, with a highly carbonated champagne like tawny white head. What a perfect pour with one of the most amazing head retentions I have seen, will have to credit this with the priming of the candied sugar. Brilliantly spiced aroma along with a thicket of musty maltiness and a decent amount of hopping. The mixture of malty sweetness, bready yeast notes, and striking bitterness equates to one of the most amazing beers in the world. The mouthfeel is a complex combination of fizzy carbonation and syrupy sweetness. If and when they begin to keg this stuff it is going to be the true end of the world. So, drinkable just imagine what it will be like on tap.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Pour it into the predescribed bowl-shaped glass. The aroma is fruity and very complex. The taste is very smooth and sweet with a lot of carbonation. It is slithgly dry, but sweet at the same time - I can't explain it well. This is a great beer and I would highly recommend it. The taste is one of a kind with a bit of spicyness about it. I love the taste, but I don't think I could drink more than one of these at a sitting because it seems like a very full bodied beer to me.

Creamy, creamy goodness just waiting to be pierced.  Smell: Fruity nose that is much more complex than my smelling skills are talented. Alcohol very present, but not distracting. Just adds to the bouquet. I smelled this for several minutes before I took the first sip, in ecstasy the entire time.  Taste: Starts creamy and sweet, then the fizzy carbonation hits. Bitter, slight cork and oak dominate the middle. Finishes slightly numbing and dry, with more woody, earthen notes.  I've had this in Belgium in the smaller bottle, and I definitely thought the 750 mL to be drier and woodier. Very impressive and wonderful brew.

I drink it moderately chilled.  A fair amount of hops with a nice malt balance. Biting carbonation. This tastes like pale ale and wheat beer all in one.  This is way too drinkable for a strong one. 8.5% but hard to tell until you are done! This is by far the most drinkable strong beer I have had.  Too bad I live in Iowa. Can't get it here.

222,695,nomad,5,"Pours a clear light gold color with tons of carbonation. Has a fluffy bulbous head at first, settling to a soft one. Nice lace and stain. In the proper glass, its a beaut.  Nose is a delicate and amazing mix of malt, wheat, and hops, embodying the definition of clear and crisp, yet still complex. Sweet, soft, and inviting, as it opens it has phenols of banana and pear with a slight vinuous edge.  Taste is creamy and malty with a hops tinge at the end. Also has a strong sweet nectar side to it, a light fruitiness akin to a version of green apples or white grapes decreased in strength (not a negative). Nice blend of stinging hops and crisp wheat underneath it all. Dry hoppy and chewy wheat-like finish, slides down your tongue with too much ease of a smooth moderate mouthfeel.  Way too drinkable considering its completely invisible alcohol content. A seemingly moderate beer yet undeniably edible. Simple, elegant, but complex, plus one of the best glass designs. It started a revolution in Belgian brew styling and continues to be a true classic. The scion of its own style.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

I grabbed the appropriate style glass, poured this baby and waited for the head to settle...10 minutes later, I was all set. The head took up half the glass, and really didn't settle down until I was about half down. Sort of a hazy buttercup yellow. Nice lace left in the glass.  Spicey in flavor, with a hint of citrus. Also, I did start feeling the alcohol in this before I was through...didn't really taste it though.  I gave this a 4 for the taste characteristics. While this was very balanced and smooth, I enjoy a little more flavor. Still very good.  pat",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,canucklehead,4.4,I haven't had this beer for a few years and I tasted it up against some Trappist ales and forgot how complex this brew becomes once it warms up.  Huge head and beautiful golden colour are trademarks of this beer but the nose is fruity and hoppy with a freshness that makes me salivate with anticapation of the first taste. The beer gets bigger with each mouthful while its drinkabilty is deceptive. I tried it cold and it still tasted full and big and when it warmed up the great balance really came to the front.

Thick, rocky head -- more or less sits atop the beer like a fluffy pillow. Very floral, spicy aroma. Fruity in the sense that many fruits -- melons, oranges, etc -- have a bitter rind and a sweet inside. This beer is more or less the same. Bitter and sweet. Very, very tasty and definitely not as hard to drink as the abv might suggest.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,SamuraiJack,4.55,"At last... Living as I do in the middle of nowhere, I suppose it's less odd that it's taken me this long to get a chance to taste this - the original in the style. First - obviously this is a beer for those who like Belgian beers (it's odd to read so many negative reviews until one realizes that the common denominator in all seem to be a dislike of the style). If you want to know if you are going to like Belgian style ales then this is the benchmark and the starting point. If you like Belgian style ales, you owe it to yourself to go get this beer. Initial pour shows a huge and incredibly active head, white and chunky and sticky. Eventually it fades into a very sticky lace. The beer itself is a gorgeous pale cloudy gold in colour. Aromas are of spice (cardamom?), pepper, malt sugar and underlying hops. It is unbelievably fragrant - even distractingly so! First taste reveals a beer that is overwhelmingly creamy and smooth. Mouthfeel is perfection in my opinion due in part to the perfect balance of the smooth creaminess and the crispness provided by the active carbonation. While many talk about the sweetness of the beer (be it honey or candy sugar in source), this sweetness is balanced ideally by the bitterness and sharpness in the foundation. Fruit esters swirl on the palate, riding on the malt and that odd and oh so tasty spice flavor. The finish is perfectly dry, leaving you hungry for more. There are beers that look gorgeous after your pour them and then disappoint when you drink them. This is not one of those beers. Each stage in the experience of this beer builds on the last - beautiful looking beer, leading to an incredible fragrence and then... the taste. Refreshing, crisp, flavorful, balanced... and right when you think ""this beer is perfect for me"" the alcohol kicks in and you suddenly remember that it's more than 8%ABV. Youch!!! If I had could only have one beer in my fridge for the rest of my life it would be this one. It's that good.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,GeoffRizzo,4.57,"Pours a cloudy yellow with a thick, soapy and bubbly head, very active. The head will maintain throughout, and thin, sugary lacing will dominate the interior of the glass, very well formed. Initial aroma is huge - spices, hops, even some vanilla, cloves and fresh bread is noticed, the aroma seems to change somewhat throughout the duration, but is always quite pleasant. An initial combined taste of fresh fruity, sugary, bubble gum, spicy flavor is quite nice, with an immediate belly warmer feeling going on. The alcohol is noticed throughout, but does not seem to be overpowering. Very creamy and delicious throughout, crisp, malty and fizzy finish, leaves you begging for more. A sipping beer, take note though, this one will sneak up on you in a hurry, the Duvel feeling will last for quite some time! For $8.50 a 4 pack, a little over 2 smacks for a Duvel, a near steal, this is an awesome brew!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Darkale,4.53,"Immense, foamy, large-bubbled, hissing head; the beer itself is a slightly cloudy gold. Aroma is hoppy, spicy, and fresh, like a summer day after rain. Crisp and cinnamon-tasting, with just enough creaminess to make it one of the most sippable (is that a word?) beers I have ever had.  Lacing is very good, and the head just will not quit. If you think it's gone for good, give the beer a few swirls -- just a few -- and it comes roaring back. Even with only 3 inches left in my tumbler, I brought an inch of head back with a couple of whirls of the glass. I really wish I had a proper chalice for this beer. Now that the Belgians are winning me over, I'm going to get one, and serious drinkers of this beer (and its ilk) really should have a proper glass to do it justice.  A definite must-try. Amazing.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Ave,3.25,"Not having tried this until just recently, I was surprised at what my eyes & nose was presented with. Bright golden in color, slightly murky like a heffe & with a massive foaming head. This brew of course really dose better in a tulip or bulb. It settles in & becomes very foamy even as it dissipates in density it holds its volume. Very impressive! The smell is almost overwhelming, as it seems to be with most of the big Belgians. Very sweet & fizzy in the nose with that wonderful Belgian yeast aroma.  The flavor is unfortunately not to my tastes, being as sweet & fizzy on the tongue as it is in the nose. It taste like Belgian Champaign beer. Not a bad thing I guess, but I don&#8217;t like most Champaigns. It is supper yummy, but just too sweet.  I can get my way through a liter, but not much more than that really.  Ave",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Mark,3.59,"Hazy light golden color, almost yellow. Exceptional frothy white head, nice rings of lace. Aroma seems similar to almost every other Belgian or Belgian style I've tried. Ditto on the taste, I can't identify it but it's a spicy hoppiness. I know it's also the yeast, espescially with Duvel as I have heard they don't use spices. Spritzy mouthfeel, almost champagne like ( a drink I don't care for) 8% on or abouts but pretty drinkable for such strength. I've tried to get in to the genre but it's not easy for me. My apologies to lovers of Belgian ale's but I can take or leave them.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,BeerBuilder,4.12,"Hazy, straw color with a thick white head. The aromas are medicinal, and fruity. The flavor is somewhat fruity; apples maybe? A sweet herbal flavor also comes through. This smooth, medium-full brew is easy drinking, finishing with a dryness that sticks with you. It has a strength that will easily sneak up on you.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,SaunaKing,1.86,"Nasty! I have heard Duvel mentioned many times since I started visiting this site so when I saw it in the store for the first time I couldn't resist trying it. The bottle had a best before of November 2005. Seems like a long shelf-life, maybe thats the norm for this style. It is a pale yellow lemony colour and is cloudy with a very large frothy head that just wont go away. You supposed to drink this through a straw or something? The smell was active and yeasty with a hint of skunk. The taste is not for me, I would compare it to a wheat beer which I am also not crazy about. This beer tastes like what I imagine a beer tasting like in the middle of the brew process. A real struggle to finish the bottle.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,GreenCard,4.05,"Golden/straw color with a billowous, fluffy, white head. If you pour this correctly, you'll be left with an ever-lasting blob of foamy head. Big-time lacing and lots of aromatics: pear, citrus, alcohol, pilsener malt and a saazy hop nose.  Despite the high alcohol content, this is an extremely light-bodied beer due to the judicious use of either belgian candi sugar or honey (lots of debate in brewing circles about this). Though you can definitely taste and feel the alcohol, it is not over-powering. It's effects kind of sneak up on you. A Devil it is. The buzz I get from this beer is different than from anything else... maybe just psychological, but I get a little ""devilish"". A FUN beer! Anyway, about the flavor... crisp, malty, fruity (again, pear), a well-balanced hop bitterness (most likely Styrian Golding), and a smooth, dry finish. Spritzy, refreshing carbonation, and very thirst-quenching.  I can't think of one single detracting element in this beer. It is the definition of the style. No surprise, since it was the first of its kind!  Drink it in it's traditional tulip-glass or something like it. You want something that tapers at the top to make sure the head stacks up nicely and you harness that wonderful aroma. Also, I prefer the Duvel in a 750 ml bottle over the 33 cl one. The flavor, carbonation, and head formation are a bit more robust in the large bottle (my feeling is that they dose the large bottles with more sugar than the small bottles).  Note: On 22-03-2005, I decided to drop Drinkability to 2.5 and Taste to 4.0 because I'm sort of tired of this beer and I don't think it should be in my top five. Not sure if it's just me or if the beer has changed.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,phattgeek,4,"Hay not a bad beer, the yeast might turn some people off. Duvel has a some-what cloudy amber color, a thick head that lasts forever, the taste is a real mouthfull, malty,fruity,spicy,dry,and smooth.

222,695,IPAlot,4.22,"Dare I say it, I like the Yankee Hennepin better. Still, a wonderfully balanced beer. Any beer that is light in feel and color, yet manages to put forth character and depth is an ace in my book.  11.2 oz bottle drank out of Delerium Tremens bowler.  Appearance: A frosty blonde. A crackling effervescence and slightly sticky head. Champagne-ish.  Smell: highly suggestive, it makes me think of women, like it is almost a perfume. Peppery, coriander, tangerines.  Taste: Smooth yet crackles with some of the finest carbonation yet to fill my mouth. Again the Champagne, with spicier kick. Like the best gassed beers, the feeling after it goes down the hatch is all giggly and wonderful.  Must taste side by side with Hennepin someday, they are both champoins strong pale ales.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,kwill,3.8,"What can I say about this beer that hasn't already been said?  Pours a clear golden color with a thick white head that seemed to stop just short of the top of the glass. Maybe I had some residue or something in my glass, but I turned my back on the glass for a minute, turned back around and the head had grown aggressively and was rising about 2.5 inches above the rim of the glass.  Smell is crisp and clean with a hint of hops and that familiar Belgian sweetness. Taste has a noticeable sweetness with a touch of hops and spice. Mouthfeel has definite carbonation and finishes very clean.  A very good beer, but there are many other Belgian's that I feel are much better.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,scottum,3.32,Seems a bit overrated to me. Pours out very pale with way too much head and froth all over the place when I uncorked the undisturbed bottle. Quite sweet with the whole Belgium citrus/grain/spicy thing going for it. There are many better brews from Belgium that I enjoy more so I plan to stay away from this pricey monster of a beer. But my advise to BAs is to try it as most floks seem to like it.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,bierman2000,4.88,"A strong Belgian golden ale doesn't get any better than this one. The color just shines thru the light and it is very drinkable , a true gem, with just the right amount of sweetness and a bit of hop balance. The foamy pour lets the beer breath and this beer truly is the Devil as the alcohol is not noticeable, until you stand up afer a few.

222,695,kbub6f,3.6,"Bought locally (Grapevine refrigerated shelves), 2-3 weeks in my fridge, served 45F, reviewed 45F-55F.  This beer poured with a huge, white, foamy head, collapsing to a dense meringue. The bottle says to pour slowly and it's easy to see why. The head clings thickly to the glass in clumps of foam.  The color is light yellow with swirls of fine sediment. Streams and streams of champagne-like bubbles rise quickly.  The smell is fairly subtle: sweet, spice, yeast.  The front is strongly sweet. The middle is spicy, citrusy, both sweetness and tart. Tingly. The finish is dry with noticable alcohol.  Overall, this is a decent beer: tasty, fresh. The alcohol doesn't really overpower the beer, but there's little complexity in the flavors to support it. I prefer Orval and Chimay... and La Trappe, come to think of it.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,AfricPepperbird,4.83,"750ml bottle, uncorked properly, poured slowly, with intense concentration.  Duvel is a pretty beer; the head is thick: it will stubbornly occupy your glass and produce a creamy, immovable topography of its own design. The color is alchemic, with a cascading effervescence not dissimilar to fizzy French wines but with duplicitous aspects that, for this price, cannot be found in real Champagne or elsewhere.  The aroma is complex, overwhelming. Spice, fruit, oppressive maltiness. The taste then expands; intense fruit esters. Banana, pear, citric sourness; ruthlessly, at first, a rude, invading stampede, but then following with a finish that lingers long as it dissolves into exotic, florid memories. The dénouement is sophisticated, an ethereal stretch; it is the proper occasion for a taste of cheese, a nut, or a bit of fruity juxtaposition. It is also the time for intense thoughts, and for deep, rustling feelings.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,TXHops,4.36,"Malts: Danish Summer Barley Hops: Styrian Goldings; Saaz IBUs : 30 SRM: 8 ABV: 8.5% Hops added three times during the boil. Dextrose added prior to primary fermentation. Two yeast strains used. Infusion mashed. Secondary cold fermentation for 1 month. Dextrose and yeast added during bottling for 3rd fermentation. (Based on info compiled by Michael Jackson.)  At the time of my writing this review, there were over 120 other BA reviews already for Duvel. As a result, I wont waste the words necessary to describe the Coors Light-pale body, the famously meringue-like head that would make a properly-poured Guinness feel inadequate, the gushing fountain of bubbles emanating from the etched bottom of my proper Duvel glass, or the stunning, textbook Brussels lace down the sides of my glass. Instead, Ill talk about what I think makes this beer different. For starters, the nose, which has the characteristic Saaz bite, also has a smell that seems to embody the concept of carbonation. The overall, non-component smell of Duvel is that of sweet corn growing near the sea. Please pardon my weak foray into poetry, for thats not my intent. I mean that Duvel literally smells like walking in a cornfield bordering a body of saltwater: like sweet Tostitos.  The indescribably smooth body gets this characteristic from the immeasurably small bubbles that eventually compose the head. I heard once that Champagne, as it ages, witnesses its bubbles literally become smaller and more numerous, lending the desired creaminess to the mouthfeel. Duvel creates this sensation even when brand new. Taking a swig, its hard to even taste any liquid until Ive swallowed, the bubbles are so numerous and foamy.  The taste is sweet and apple-pear like, with perhaps some lesser hints of figs, lemons, vanilla and lightly almond-flavored pastries. The long, long finish exhibits more of the sweetened Tostitos flavor (perhaps more like Capn Crunch cereal?) before it sours a bit in the back of my mouth. The souring, however, is less prevalent than it is in the VAST majority of other Belgian Ales, whose sweetness is almost never fully mitigated by hop bitterness. Since Duvel has a touch of acidity to begin with, the sourness is not entirely unanticipated, nor unpleasant.  For a Belgian Ale, Duvel is one of my all time favoritesnot as sweet as most, and slightly hoppier. Its also so amazingly elegant and well balanced. Even not being a big fan of this style, its hard to find faults with Duvel",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,AudioGilz,4.8,"The cork flew right out of my hand with a literally deafening pop sound. My right ear is still ringing and I think the neighbors called the police. This amazing beer pours a pale, hazy yellow with a huge white head that loves to hang out and tease you. I smell a very pleasant fruitiness, mostly lemon. The mouthfeel is very crisp from the high carbonation, but it's a most enjoyable carbonation. To simply state the complexity of taste: sweet, fruity, spicy(mostly on the finish), simply amazing. This beer defines what high drinkability is. 8.5% ABV? You would never have a clue of that high level without the label on the bottle stating it. Not to sound repetitive, but this beer can definitely be dangerous. I'm going to struggle to limit myself to one 750mL bottle.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,HossMcGraw,4.89,"So good it's painful. This is a beer you don't ever want to stop drinking. One of the best qualities of this is the sound it makes when you pop the cap. The ""whooshing"" sound of the air escaping lasts twice as long as most beers and if you put your hand near it, you can feel that it's twice as powerful. It takes much longer than most beers to pour also because the head was so large. I once tried to take a sip of this straight out of the bottle, and was punished with a head that rushed out and foam went everywhere. I learned my lesson: A beer of this quality requires respect. As for the taste, a strong yeast flavor is the first thing I notice. A wonderful flavor of ripe fruit follows. Apricot, apple, peach, it's all there. It's got a slightly alcoholic finish which doesn't bother me in the least. It just serves as a reminder of the strength of this brew. The apperance could have been a little darker, and the mouthfeel a little thicker, but other than that, It's pretty close to perfection. If you haven't tried this yet, you need to right now.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,BitteBier,4.53,"Hazy golden lemon color and a formidable head (even after a gentle pour) with the consistency and color of stiff egg whites. Persistent carbonation adds to the attraction of this pretty pour. Smell is very pleasant though a tad weaker than one might expect given the ""action"" of this beer. Clean malty grains and yeast with some spice on the edges. A really wonderful, interesting taste. The easiest aspect of the taste to pick out is the yeasty, bready finish. Sweet grains start it out, giving way to noticeable carbonation and an astringent warmth and finally the afore-mentioned finish. Mouthfeel is clean and pleasant--the flavors linger without coating the mouth. Given the strength of this ale, it has an ominously drinkable character.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

Very good Belgian.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,bog,5,"There's not too much to say about this beer, and yet there's so much to say. It is perfection. Each time I taste it, I can taste a different aspect: it's sweet, yet not overpoweringly sweet while a little bitter; it's spicy, but not so much to hide its flavors; it tastes light on the tongue, but it has depth (it feels like no other beer I've had). It's as though someone took an excellent Pilsner and slapped an amazing brew on top of it. At 8.5% alcohol, you'd think that you could taste the alcohol, but the flavors all work together to leave no hint of alcohol, making it that much more dangerous. This only bad thing I have to say about this beer is that my local beer stores often run out of it leaving me to desire it almost all the time.  Serving Note: While I don't buy into the Belgian ideal that every beer deserves its own glass, there's something satisfying about pouring Duvel into its glass and letting the head almost overflow taking up half the glass. It's a beautiful glass of beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,JohnnyDuvel,4.68,"My favorite beer (hence the nickname). A much copied style (and copied very well by many), this stands out even amongst the great competition. There is just a little something extra-tangy in the taste that I haven't experienced, even after trying many of the greatest Belgian ales (my favorite style). The appearance and taste are legendary. Huge, lemon meringue looking head, fruity, spicy taste. Unbelievable drinkability for such a potent beer! I'm sure these strong ales aren't for everybody, but every beer lover should give this a try. As for you Belgian beer fans, try it head to head against the ""competition"". Somehow, the Duvel is totally unique. Enjoy!!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Mitchster,2.47,"Phoosh, off goes the cap with a blast. Pouring it slowly was not enough to tame this wild head. The head literally GROWS before your eyes, forming a peak of meringue so thick, you can float a half dollar on it. The beer itself is highly carbonated. It actually formed whirlpools of spiral bubbles in my glass. The color is crystal clear straw golden. Aroma is typical Weihenstephan Weizen yeast, with that banana/clove tang. Pretty typical in the aroma department. The taste is also pretty typical bavarian wheat, but with a warming punch of alcohol. No lambic aroma or taste. Has a sweetness in the back of the throat for the finish, and not much for hop flavor. Fumes of alcohol warm the nostrils after a hearty gulp. Aside from the wonderful head, I don't know why this beer earns such stellar reviews. It may be a Belgian-style strong pale ale, but it tastes like a typical bavarian wheat, and not even a good one at that. In my opinion, it tastes like a ""DoppleWeizen"". I had a hard time finishing just one bottle, and would not buy another in the future.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Naerhu,4.3,Amazing mountainous head and a wonderfully integrated pepper/citrus/alcohol aroma. It has a good citrus/ alcohol flavor with a creamy medium/light body.

222,695,kunzbrew,4.5,Pours a clear straw color until the last drops of the yeast fall into suspention then the beer turns a hazy which is quite pleasing. The citrus fruit fills the nose with hop overtones that are lovely. I wonder if they use candi sugar like homebrewers do to get the high alcohol content.

The beer is golden with the thickest head I've ever dealt with, there were icebergs of foam. The lacing was thick and pervasive. The beer had a cloudy, mucky appearence as well, with lines of bubbles dragging up the sides. The smell is of fruits and alcohol in my book, even here I notice some champagne-like characteristics.

Thie beer pours a syrupy golden colour with an ultra dense rocky head that just won't quit, and it smells excellent. The aroma of Duvel is hard to pin down but it is very spicy, peppery, and full. The taste is more of the same and not as alcoholic as many would expect a 8.5%abv beer to be. The mouthfeel is slick, smooth, and full which lends an excellent level of drinkability to this beer.

Duvel was my introduction to great beer. I read an article about the 10 best beers in the world. Duvel was #1, so on my first trip to Europe, I couldn&#8217;t wait to try it. I remember sitting in Brussels' Grand Place with my father. They came out with that lovely golden brew with a beautiful head of foam. We were amazed by how good this was! I have seen this reaction from many people to whom I&#8217;ve introduced this masterpiece. At Belgo in London. one friend mentioned liking Pawel Kwak, so we each agreed to order the other&#8217;s favorite. Needless to say, after that round, we both ordered Duvel. It is the perfect &#8220;food&#8221; beer, especially for highly-spiced or &#8220;sweet&#8221; cuisines like Indian, Thai, or Szechuan. My only quibble is I think the &#8220;white label&#8221; is better than the &#8220;black label&#8221; version despite protestations from the importer that they are the same. The &#8220;white&#8221; seems smoother and less carbonated. Winstonian says that the &#8220;white&#8221; is lower in alcohol, but I have no corroboration. More amazing is that this is no &#8220;boutique&#8221; beer. In fact, it is practically the Benelux Budweiser, and is still made by the family-owned brewery. I admire the Unibroues of the world, but this is the original and still champ; le vrai roi des bieres!  Backwash: Often someone on the forum asks which beer would you drink if it were your &#8220;desert island&#8221; beer. Well, I can&#8217;t think of a better one: refreshing, complex, satisfying, and devilishly drinkable. Appropriate in almost every circumstance. I&#8217;ve seen a novelty item, which enclosed a cigarette and match in a glass tube, marked &#8220;break glass in case of emergency.&#8221; Well, this is the beer I would want in that (bigger) tube.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

It poured a rich golden blonde with a sweet aroma and luscious fruity essence that was one of the main attractions I had hoped for. The taste was rather clean and crisp with a warm spice of after taste. The ABV of 8.5% was cleary masked in the flavor though it later help in keeping warm.

Possibly the head with the most flavour of any beer I have tried.  This is a fantastic middle ground for luring over lager fans to the ale side of beer.

Very fine bubbles of carbonation can be seen trailing up through the liquid. The lacing this beer leaves on the glass leaves no doubt why the call it ""belgian lace"". The aroma is unmistakably Saaz hops, with some similarities to Pilsner Urquell. However, this beer has much more going on in the nose. An overall sweetness, with some fruity pear notes dominate the aroma. The taste is fantastic. At first, it doesn't seem like much is going on, but then the flavors start developing. None of the tastes are stronger than the others, as this is a beautifully balanced beer. Alcohol notes of sweetness are present immediately, but just a hint. Then a light peppery citrus flavor appears, only to be replaced by a spicy bitterness. Then some sweetness reappears, but it's different than the initial sweetness. The finish is clean but yet flavorful. The mouthfeel is very good, but the carbonation seems a little strong as it tickles the back of my throat. For 8.5% ABV, this beer is amazingly drinkable. the alcohol is present in sweetness only, and that nice warming feeling your throat gets as you swallow the beer.

Pours a slightly hazy beautiful golden color with perhaps the most magnificent head I have ever seen on a beerthick, rocky, and creamy white that you can have billowing out of the top of your glass with no spillage. It also has an outstanding retention and laces the sides of your glass as the head eventually dissipates. Nose is clean and fruity with notes of citrus, sweet malts, pepper, and spice. A light fruitiness of orange and lemon come through in the taste upfront with a nice blend of sweet malts and bitter and spicy hops. Smooth and creamy in the mouth with a very nice carbonation.

Awesome appearance with a slightly hazed yellowish hue and one massive white rocky head that lasted longer than Duracell batteries. The aromas were a bit strange at first with a slight skunky twang to the aromas, but after letting it sit for a while, nice fruity esters and spices with a slight hint of yeast in the background revealed themselves. The taste was out of this world with nicely blending of yet again, fruity twang, spices, and light yet not sticky yeast and alcohol on the tail. It has a light to medium bodied mouthfeel and it leaves you wanting more. Simply amazing! Op uw gezonheid!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,BeerGlassesCollector,4.25,Pours a golden colour topped by a huge nice head. The aroma of this beer is a bit spicy with hints of malt. Flavor is malty and spicy. Mouthfeel is quite strong due to carbonation and don't forget that the alcohol level is 8.5%. One the finest strong pale ales of Belgium.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Wildman,4.1,"This beer poured a pale straw color and formed an amazing foamy-sudsy head like a float that left circular lace. A beautiful heavy carbonation was present. An aroma of malt, citrus and spice. A flavor of malt, citrus and spices with a mouthfeel quite tangy, but not overpowering brought on by the heavy carbonation and the citrus elements. Truely a great find with the new Ohio law change. Also good review for my 500th Karma level.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,feloniousmonk,5,"Huge, billowing lacey, white-as-the -driven-snow head that must be properly poured into it's own glass, or the closest equivalent. You know, I've seen people gulp Duvel out of the bottle, and I didn't have my gun on me? Their loss! This is a golden beauty whose aroma has to savored and worshipped. Spicey, fragrant, floral, angelic. Pours clear and golden like a lager or a pils, but, buddy, it ain't! Letting the yeast in with the pour gives an extra amber/ orange haze: go ahead, drink the yeast, it's good for you! Flavor floods the tongue, Saaz hops jitterbug along the taste buds, and the finish will not quit the mouth. Overwhelmingly pleasant! Head settles some, but remains as a 1/2"" ring. Excellent with the Thai ginger & curry noodles I'm having. The flavor, the spark, the spice, it all lingers on and on. Is there any greater delight? Do five stars mean anything at all if they are not applied to a brew so fine and lovely?",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Popsinc,4.6,"Golden in colour, large white head. Nicely hopped nose. This beer goes down like a champagne, well carbonated, with a dry finish. A nice balance of hops and an alcohol kick that is hidden in the wonderful mouthfeel of this classic. be careful, this one will sneak up on you!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,mjohn27603,4.43,11.2 fluid oz. bottle best before 4/04 served right out of the refrigerator. Poured very slowly as recommed by the bottle and fellow BA'ers. I got a fizzy carbonation like a seltzer. Aroma reminds me of cider. First impressions of taste indicate dry flavor with a hint of spiciness. Fizzy carbonation leaves light impression in mouth. High alcohol kicks in by stealth - deceptively drinkable.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,RBorsato,4.95,"Hazy pale yellow with a full white head and good carbonation throughout. Spicy hop aroma (Saaz and Styrian Goldings) with a light fruitiness. Fruity flavors dominate (orange zest, pears) and alcohol is evident as it warms. Medium bodied but a very light impression for the strength. Also, very effervescent (a bit airy for me) with a smooth and dry finish.  Best Before: 05/2004 Tasted 11/11/02 [11.2 oz bottle]  Note: this beer was #4 in Stuart Kallen's ""The 50 Greatest Beers in the World"". Hard to argue with that one !",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,bditty187,4.73,"Golden hue with a slight haziness from the yeast, the white head is magical in its fluffy nature, a soft pour can easily produce three fingers in height of a pillow head. This is an outstanding looking beverage, even more so if you serve it in the Duvel glass. The nose is lemon, pepper, spice, yeast, and sweet malt. The bouquet is delicate but alluring. The flavors on the palate are remarkable with a wonderful blend of citrusy grapefruit and lemon, pepper, intermediate hints of sweetness and full-blown hoppy bitterness. The beer finishes dry yet fruity and spicy. Good acidity. There is a creaminess and liveliness produced by the massive carbonation on the tongue. This is more than beer, it is magic in a bottle. Obviously the high alcohol content makes this a devil of a drink, mainly because you cant detect it, and, well, it is so damn pleasant to quaff it is impossible to be satisfied with one glass. Its like champagne but far more sophisticated. Duvel is flawless. It is worth every penny. Id say this is my favorite beer all-time.  In Omaha four-packs run $12.00, however in Kansas City they run $8.00, a good buy!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,TheLongBeachBum,4.68,"Pours a very pale golden color, totally translucent at first but can resemble a wheat beer if the yeast is mistakenly decanted into your Glass. Carbonation is very high, resulting in a very stiff egg-white head that is both rocky and extremely uneven, and rises VERY quickly when poured  first time drinkers, you have been warned!. Yeast resided firmly in the bottom of the bottle I had, and a swirl was required with some reverse decanted beer back into the bottle to extract it. Nose was incredibly spicy, with some light peppery traits, a citric fruity presence, and a definite alcohol aroma with some malt-sweetness in the back. Introduction starts with some alcohol, a light spicy Saaz hop bitterness coupled with a little malt-sweetness is detectable. Citric, fruity lemon tinges were also perceptible as the beer warmed. A powerful beer, whose mouthfeel is totally solid and can be quite dominant at times. Aftertaste is quite short lived I noticed, something I have never paid particular attention to before, but noticed for the first time when I did this Review. This does not detract from the beer at all. The finish is astringent and bitter, with a feint alcoholic kick right at the death. Extremely clean drinking beer that is, despite its heavyweight 8.5% ABV, very easily and dangerously imbibed. A highly accomplished Belgium Golden Strong Ale. For me, this beer is THE definitive example of this oft mis-aligned style, and one that I hope to continue enjoying for many years to come. If Trappist beers are indeed Godly, then this is definitely the Devils Beer.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,aracauna,4.06,"Pours pale gold with a massive crown of stiff white foam. The foam fades unevenly, leaving peaks and crags. It actually looks fairly dry and sticky. I had expected the body to be cloudy from yeast, but it was clear. The yeast was firmly attached to the bottom and I had not left any beer in the bottle to swirl with thinking that enough yeast would come out that I wouldn't have too since I wasn't wanting a lot of yeast in the beer. The aroma was typical spiciness of the style, with a little of the spicy noble hops (saaz) complimenting the yeast spice. Lemon and a faint sweetness were also present. Duvel seems a bit maltier than other belgian strong pales. Besides the malt and typical yeasty flavors, there was a very faint hint of vanilla and cantaloupe melon. There was also a very faint cheese flavor in the finish. The flavor leaves the palate quickly and is rather dry. I was expecting more spice from this beer, but it's actually quite balanced (possibly because the yeast was stuck in the bottle).",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Anonmatel,4.15,"Love it, My experience was dimmed the first time however, The Barmaid poured it improperly. Having said that, i still enjoyed it immensly. The wide variety of tastes and smells in this brew alone, peppery, fruity etc. I couldn't tatse the alcohol in it that much.  A wonderful beer that i can never get enough of.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,DerKaiser,4,"This sure is a pretty beer. Nice and golden with a huge white, lumpy head that hangs around forever.  The taste is nice and peppery, with hints of apple cider and clove in there as well. Finishes abruptly. However, I wasn't quite as impressed, overall, as most of the other reviewers have been. I even purchased the proper Duval glass the second time around (which I love), to make sure I wasn't missing anything. I mean it's a very good beer and I'll certainly never turn one down, but I'm much more impressed by La Fin du Monde, which seems all lot more complex. Bottom line is Duval is definetly a must try for every BA.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Lupe,4.83,"Pours absolutely beautiful: hazy pale-golden color with a creamy-chunky head that leaves woderful lace. The aroma is fruity and sweet, some yeast, and spicy notes. Light to medim body with a soft, smooth mouthfeel - carbonation works nicely. Full, rich flavor with a malt-candylike sweetness. Next comes some bitterness and spiciness. A lemon rind-like taste pulls it all together with great balance. great either chilled or after warming a bit. Alcohol stays hidden, making it very easy to drink. A temptation from the Devil. A -class beer!!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,hyuga,4.88,"When poured slowly into a Duvel glass, this beer is beautifully presented. Half of the glass is filled with the pale golden elixir, which is only slightly hazy since I left about 2cm in the bottle to keep the yeast out. This is topped off with a huge, rocky, pure white head that leaves a generous amount of lace, yet stays very well. A steady stream of bubbles rises from the very bottom of the glass, helping the head's wonderful staying power. Spicy aroma of pepper and fruit esters, along with some malt presence in the background. On the palate, delicate yet spicy pepper tickles at the tongue, creating a tingly yet smooth mouthfeel. Slightly fruity sweetness is the major player here, and goes perfectly with the spiciness. Very slight hop character shows itself in a rind-like bitterness around the middle and in the finish. The finish is otherwise sweet, but is dominated by the aforementioned hop bitterness. The high alcohol content is not at all noticeable, making this dangerously drinkable! This is a god among beers, truly a masterpiece and worthy of its high esteem. One of the wonders of the beer world.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,sponberg,4.38,"Bright gold with a huge white rocky head that lasts forever. Bottle said ""best before 6/2005.""  A fruity sweet (pear/apple) nose leads to a sweet, malty, fruit estery (banana, green apple, pear, pineapple? clove?) flavor with a wonderfully mouth-filling character. The finish is remarkably like a granny smith apple dipped in malt. Vastly drinkable for its strength.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Gusler,3.62,"The pour produces a stupendous white, foamy head, heaps of lace. The beer is straw in color, clear, with a splendiferous nose, citrus, bubble gum, malt, hints of ripe pineapple, ""Quite Sniffable"". Front is malt, sweet, the top light, the finish acerbic, dry, sparingly hopped. A good beer, but I will take an ""Orval"" over this beer anytime. Ranks #494 on my current 1000 beer master list.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,NeroFiddled,4.68,"This beer poured perfectly clear until the end of the bottle when the yeast was roused. A perfect decant was not possible as the head was literally rising out of the glass! Hazy yellow-gold body with an orange-cast topped by a dense, rocky bright-white head that holds extremely well - buoyed by a tight-beaded effervescent carbonation - and leaves some exceptional lace . The aroma is quite fragrant: fruity, yeasty, candy sweet and malty, lightly peppery with a touch of spicy hops. The body is light/medium with an extremely fine and highly effervescent carbonation that is pillowy soft and velvety smooth in the mouth. The flavor is surprisingly full and rich, starting with a candyish malty sweetness, becoming dryish in the middle with some earthy and lightly spicy hop flavors, and finishing long and malty with some more distinct Saaz notes and touches of bitterness. The alcohol is amazingly well hidden. Impressively balanced with a fresh hop presence and bitterness that dances amongst such sweet malt character. Amazing. As Michael Jackson notes, Duvel is equally impressive served chilled, or as it warms toward cellar temperature. This makes it quite drinkable, and enjoyable, as a glass can be savored over a period of time. One of my favorite beers in the world, and absolutely recommended.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,jmatthew,4.8,"A classic in every right. An intricately crafted, perfectly-balanced, golden yellow champagne of a beer under a lacy mountain of foam that dances perilously close to an avalanche when poured. With sweet fruit and spice, this beer packs a warm alcoholic kick in the arse without a threatening taste or mouthfeel. Smooth and beautiful.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,mzwolinski,4.58,"Beautiful light gold color, with a thick foamy head that won't quit. Slightly hazy from bottle refermentation.  Aroma reminded me a bit of a hefeweisen, though a bit spicier, hoppier and with a stronger nose of alcohol. Cloves and bananas seemed evident.  Taste is champagne-like. Slightly yeast with. Spicy hop flavor with a medium-light malt body. Somewhat dry finish -- very smooth. Quite a nice beer, and very drinkable in spite of the alcohol.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,beerluvr,4.87,"This classic pours with the ""patented"" massive and huge pillowy white rocky head. Slightly hazy liquid gold with vigorous carbonation in the glass. Nose is crisp, fresh hops, clean maltiness with a hint of pears evident. Taste is also crisp, slightly acidic and hoppy...very lively, with light-bodied maltiness to mellow things out a bit. Finishes long, dry and bitter. A classic, easy-to-drink golden ale...the 8% alcohol is hardly noticable, imbiber beware!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,yen157,4.53,"One of the greats. A slightly cloudy, yellow brew with a rocky, perfectly white head. Banana and cloves in the nose, very nice. The spice in the beer, which comes out first, was accentuated by the carbonation. Next came the alcohol along with the hops, slightly bitter and warming, followed by the malt. The only aftertaste is a little tartness and vanilla. This is one of the beers that started my love affair with the nectar of the gods, or in this case, the devil.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,beernut7,4.32,Pours into the goblet with a heavy frothy white head. The head sticks around for the whole trip. The very pale golden color is enhanced by the thin ascending bubble trails that permeate the brew. The very fragrant aroma has scents of Belgian yeast and lemon with hints of alcohol. The bold flavor is tart with a strong yeast character and a huge alcoholic warming quality. This beer beats out any good wine I have tried. A very tasty libation with a kick and a half.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,garymuchow,4.38,"Poured slowly as suggested on the bottle. Looked like water as poured, but noted the fizzy sound. Huge head that settled very slowly with big bubbles. Later much laciness on the glass. Aroma changed over time. Initially light malt with fruitiness and spice that turned to clove. Pale yellow color and clear. Taste has complexity. Starts off light, moves to spiciness (cloves and some fruitiness) with malt, then a shot of alcohol (that stays to the finish), and concludes with mild lingering somewhat bitter dryness. Thinner mouthfeel and despite the huge head the carbonation while evident doesn't seem excessive (yet there is some experience of fullness). Very interesting beer. Seems worthy of its higher ranking amongst all beers. I will try this again.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,zerk,4.62,"Appearance is a nice gold-yellow with a very impressive head. Head lasted for 15 or more minutes, and settled to a very nice lace. Quite a bit of carbonation as well.  Aroma was very pleasant, yeasty and clove-like.  Flavor was very balanced, not too much hop or malt, and a dry clove finish. It's light and crisp, with a high amount of carbonation.  You have to watch out... this beer is quite strong, but doesn't taste like it is. It'll sneak up on you if your not careful (as I can attest.)",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Bighuge,3.18,"The beer pours similar to champagne as you can here a fizzle as you pour. The beer is a slghtly hazy light golden. Head is bubbly, fizzy and white. Nice bready yeastiness on the nose with some subtle fruitiness making an appearance also. The beer is somewhat jacked up with carbonation. A bit gaseous in the mouth. The taste is pleasant. That's about it. There's a bready yeast characteristic on the palate as well. Some slight accents of alcohol. And fruitiness. Orange comes to mind. The beer's light to medium in body.  For some reason, I just can not get as hyped as a lot of beer lovers do over Belgians. Maybe there is an anti-belgian beer chromosone in my family's gene pool (as my brother ZAP feels the same way about Belgians).",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,beertravel,4.78,"Probably one of the best beers in the world, this foamy, golden Belgian Ale is meticulously crafted and not allowed to leave the brewery until ready. The distinctive large white head and the mouth-watering smell of spices on the nose rewards the drinker with a burst of spice on the tongue that one will never forget. Again, the drinkability does not belie the fact that it is a high gravity brew, so be prepared to savor the experience responsibly.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,budgood1,4.43,"the devil finally caught up with me, and i sold my soul. bright pale with a huge frothy head. the massive carbonation made it very easy to inhale the fruit and spice in the nose. very bubbly/prickly on the tongue, like a sparkling wine. a much lighter body than i expected. the unique taste of the fruity yeast and pale malts makes for a moderately spicy, delicious brew. the hop bitterness gets twisted up in the carbonation, and lingers on the tongue. the 8.5 abv is lost in all the sweet, spritzy, effervescent action. way too refreshing for so much alcohol, so be careful. the only drawback i could find is the way the carbonation gets in the way of deciphering flavors on the tongue, making for an odd mouthfeel (the bubbles just dance in my mouth!). nonetheless, a great brew worthy of the hype. i think the devil is telling me to go buy more....",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

There is a thick rich white head with lots of action and a fluffy lace.. It just looks deliciously evil. The lace sticks to your glass (chimay gobletin this case) and lips like frothed milk.  There is some special yeast in store for you upon tasting. You are enveloped in smooth yeasty richness. The balence is helped along by hints of fruit and hop bitterness. This beer is not for the timid, but at the same time it slides down effortlessly. The look of this brew is hypnotic. Why on the bottle would they tell you ""not to drink the yeast"" is beyond me!

Light vinous flavors and swallows with a lot of carbonation. There's a slight hoppy cut to the initial flavor and in the mid-mouth feel. There's a lot of sparkling wine-like flavor. It is interesting. A modern classic, finely brewed -- but not for my normal tastes. Tart and bready at the same time. But I found it to have a higher than expected drinkability.

I must admit, Belgian style beers are not my all time fav, but I do enjoy them, and this one in particular. It poured out a nice light yellow color, reminiscent of champagne. A light pillowy head formed at the top and appeared almost meringue-like but not super creamy. The aroma was light and spicey with some subdued yeast. Had a pleasantly light, citrus and spice flavor with a light alcoholic echo in the background, almost unnoticeable. Nice effervescence, dry,slight yeast, and nice warming after effect.

Duvel has a very pronounced, fruity aroma, lemons and pears. The first bottle I had, I did not realize that there was some yeast in the bottle (although I love the yeast). The beer is very refreshing, and very fruity. Somewhat dry finish, very pleasant. For a beer with this amount of alcohol, I do not get the alcohol warmth from other high octane beers.Looks great, smells good, very drinkable, but to me it misses the essence of a good beer. Great for its style, but it ain&#8217;t my style. Addendum: more than a slight hangover the next morning.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Thrasher,3.96,"My initial impression is that this beer is overrated. That said, it's still pretty good. I am unclear on the delineation between a tripel and this style; no matter. Prolific frothy head, very pale; vaguely reminiscent of Aying's Jahrhundert although milkier and lacking the lager characteristics. Also a hidden spice but this is very subtle. It is an unseasonably hot and humid day today, and this seems to be affecting the beer in positive ways. It is crisper, more refreshing. This is the 3rd bottle of a 4 pack and the most enjoyable so far. The first 2 (and this one, to a lesser extent) had vague euro-skunky characteristics, much like Heineken. Expiration date is 5/04 so that can't be it.

Frighteningly easy to drink. Peppery and a touch tart (via green apples and pineapple) on the palate. Bready backing with a well hopped finale. Styrian Goldings work their drying magic Highly charged-up, at first, but it just gets better as it sits, as the delightful flavors are brought out more and more. I never would tire of this.

Price for a case around Philly will leave you crying & asking were is all my money! It's between $45-50 a case!",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Jordan,4.32,"Extremely carbonated (quite a spectacle), head froths so easily and endures long long after initial pour. Super pale yellow, almost white. Mellow spices on the nose, a typical belgian scent. Initial shock comes when the razor sharp bittersweetness hits your tongue, follows through with a spicey almost hot notes. The flavor penetrates deep into the palate, leaving a long aftertaste. A sharp tangy crisp mouthfeel. Would be quite the summer refresher beer, despite the 8.5% ABV. Always wanted to try this infamous brew, was worth $9 for the four-pack.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,QXSTER1,4.9,Giant rocky white head that lasts forever and laces the obligatory Belgian Chalice. Fruity malt in the nose followed by a deceptively smooth taste for the alcohol content. Spicy malt followed by a long dryish hop finish. Lovely to watch the champagne like bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass as I savor this first class Belgian.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,mmthompson33,4.94,"This beer deserves its place in history. Just the right mix of hops and sweetness for a crisp, clean flavor that somehow hides its devilish alcohol content.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,BKotch,4.65,"What can I possibly say? This is a world classic, one of the greatest beers brewed, bar none. You've got to drink this one in the proper glass if you want to contain the massive head. Fruity and complex in a clean, delicate way. More than 750 ml and I'm down for the count.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,John,4.9,Outstanding brew. Remarkable fruity flavor imparted by the yeast. I prefer to let this warm a bit and let some of the carbonation dissipate before drinking.,Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,Brent,4.76,"Nice and peppery. So smooth and mild, I can't believe it has an abv of 8.5%. Wait, what's that buzzing sound I hear? I guess I can believe it.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
222,695,AaronRed,4.38,"I reviwed this a year ago and felt tit was time for an update. Poured into the glass with a big rocky and creamy head. Clear- doesn't look strong. Spicey smell- almost like wine. Taste is smooth and crisp, but dry. Some flowery taste as well. So drinkable, it's scary.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94

222,695,Todd,4.83,"Presentation: 33cl custom shorty with a bulbed neck. Best before date: 03/2003. Serve chilled.  Appearance: Cloudy (from escaped yeast) and pale. A grande creamy, chunk head adorns the top and sticks with great stay. The colour and head are perfection incarnate.  Smell: Delicate spice, pepper and clean malt sweetness.  Taste: Smooth and extremely creamy on the palate. A lively carbonation creates a light mouthfeel and crispness. Upfront flavours are bitter and sweet, with a lean on the sweet; distinct fruity malt esters, bold spiciness and rind-like twang that mellows and balances. Finishes slightly grain/dry with some residual spice and dextrin notes.  Notes: Deceivingly seductive and powerful. It lurs you with mesmerizing eye candy, then as the absolute refresher, then whacks the shite out of you with an 8.5% abv club. It's not called the ""Devil"" for nothing.  One of the best beers on the face of the Earth. Bow down to this god of beers.",Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Belgium,Belgian Pale Strong Ale,94
