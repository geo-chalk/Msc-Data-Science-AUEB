10099,2093,cjgiant,4.31,"It's about time I rated this after all these years.  Pours an orange-tinged amber with high clarity and a nice off-white head that is replenished from visuble carbonation steams. Nose while cold is muted malt with a more obvious citrus rind scent - more grapefruit than orange/tangerine. Taste at this point has toasted malt much more overt than the nose. Grapefruit pith provides an early bitterness, but is backed by an interesting and familiar earthy orange marmalade. The sweetness that underlies the significant bitterness reminds me of DFH in general and Burton Baton more specifically in this case.  The beer starts light but seems to gain a bit of weight as it finds its way to the back of my palate. It shows a little of its alcohol content with a warming sensation as it gets all the way back. Warmth, as it usually does, rounds out the somewhat distinct stages of the beers tastes described above. It also brings out more in the nose, specifically to me some orange blossom / honey and a fair dose of pine, along with a little spice or alcohol bite (can't quite decide which).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,PsDavito,4.5,"Definitely a go to. It’s just good. Hoppy nose, malty backbone, not too heavy, citrus notes, it’s an all around well crafted brew. Costs a few more dollars in South Alabama but with this one you get what you pay for. Cheers.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,tyden46,3.75,A little bitter for me but I appreciate the balance between malt and hops. Generally not a fan of bitter IPAs but this is one of the better ones.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,JimDcos,4.79,I'm no expert but if someone asked me to name the five top beers in the USA this IPA would be in that list. A dark amber color with a rich head that lasts. At 9% ABV this is not one you would want to be pounding down on a fishing trip; it's one of those rare brews that invites sipping and relaxing. Depending on ones palate it can initially come across as a bit bitter on the first sip but continuing on there are nice spice and citrus notes to enjoy. You owe it to yourself to try at least one of these 12 ounce marvels.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,sucail,4.65,"Dark amber color with an off white head. Smells mostly of citrus, but also some sweetness, and a hint of booziness as it warms up.  Taste wise, it’s a bit bitter with a strong hop flavor at the start and in the aftertaste. All that is underlined by a really nice, sweet caramel malt flavor that gets more pronounced in the middle of the sip and as it warms up. I also get a buttery bread note that reminds me of brioche rolls. Feels a bit thicker than other IPAs, with a good level of carbonation.  I’ve only gotten into craft beer within the past year, but this is probably my favorite IPA I’ve tried yet. A great balance of hops and malt.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,AZgman,3.87,"I guess it is just me, but this beer has too heavy of an alcohol finish. It is pretty tasty, (especially for 9% ABV), but I just as soon not have that much potency in a beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,dano213,4.23,"12oz bottle purchased from the fridge as a single for $2.99. No bottled on date, just a best by date of Mar 2023. I don't know how they calculate that...this bottle is probably not more than two months old. When are breweries going to stop putting best by dates instead of using bottled on/canned on dates? I have no problem with a best by date as long as it is accompanied by a born on date.  Look: Pours a very pretty amber color with an eggshell colored head. The head was very frothy and one-finger high initially, then it reduced to about a quarter finger tall.  Smell: Tons of pine and orange zest on the nose. It smells resinous, but not dank. Some green bell pepper aroma after swirling the glass. There's a touch of caramel or crystal malt coming through on the finish. It also smells a bit boozy, especially initially. A lot of that booziness blew off though. Overall, the nose It gives off a nice warm, winter-spiced impression and it smells intoxicatingly good.  Taste: For being 9% ABV, this is incredibly drinkable and delicious. Okay, I am feeling a warming sensation in my chest because I am probably drinking this a bit too fast. But still, it hides the alcohol very well. Up front, it has a nice caramel malt flavor that plays really well with the orange zest and pine flavors. The beer goes down smooth and leaves behind a mild to moderate bitterness with tons of pinecone, spruce, bitter orange, and spice notes. Some alcohol burn on the finish. I should be sipping it, but it's so tasty that I want to drink it quickly.  Feel: It's medium plus bodied and that mouthfeel is slick and oily with a bit of chewiness.  Overall: I haven't had this beer in a few years, and I don't know why not. It's one of those beers that is so old school that it loses a lot of its appeal when you see it on the shelves or in the fridge, partly because it is so old school and a bit ""out of style"" and partly because there are so many other beers that I haven't tried yet that I want to try. So yeah, it's easy to pass this one by, but it deserves more respect. Enjoy it fresh and enjoy it!  Excerpt from the website: Continual hopping provided a beautiful balance to our Imperial IPA - allowing us to add a foolhardy amount of hops throughout the boil without making 90 Minute crushingly bitter. With rich pine and fruity citrus hop aromas and a strong malt backbone, 90 Minute IPA created pungent, unapologetic flavor that led Esquire to call it “perhaps the best IPA in America.”  COLOR Golden amber AROMA Heavy piney and citrus hop aromas FLAVOR Brandied fruitcake, raisiney, citrusy MOUTHFEEL Full and malty with slightly lingering bitterness",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Hooded,4.33,"Notes from 6/28/2022. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Spiegelau IPA glass. The beer is clear amber with 1.25 fingers of off-white head. Retention is good especially for a DIPA. There's a cap. The intensity of aroma is slightly below medium. There are notes of grapefruit, a little lemon, pine, malt, wheat bread or maybe brown bread in general, and a hint of fruitcake. The intensity of taste is not quite strong. The flavor has a lot of malt, a lot of hops, boose, grapefruit, pine and a general citris flavor. The feel is thick, slightly slick, and has a moderate astringency level. Overall, it's a very good dependable DIPA. The aroma is somewhat better than the flavor. I buy a Six-Pack of this about once a year when I want a DIPA I can count on.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,slugman,5,"I just picked this up at the store. I suspected Dogfish would be awesome and I had not heard of this one. Poured cold into a glass, I am so happy. This is a pro-brew. No after taste, no BS. This is a serious brew that people should try. I will be looking for the 6 pack. The grocery store only sells the big can.  Give it a try, I think you will be happy, even if you are into the ""fruity IPA"" that I love.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,JesseJames81,3.9,"Appearance: Pours a rich, golden reddish amber color, with a thick white foam head. Good retention and leaves behind some sticky lacing.  Aroma: Sweet bready malt and pine. A subtle touch of citric fruit.  Taste. A pronounced maltiness followed by hoppy layers of citrus and pine. Some bready biscuit notes. Malt backbone and a bitterness that starts half-way through, and rides all the way to the end. Finishes fairly clean.  Overall: This is one interesting, well balanced beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,LucidoMMA,4.35,First review here goes. Glassware used - Lagunitas pint glass Appearance- pours an amber color with a 1 finger foam head.  Smells sweetly like of caramel and apples.

10099,2093,ReverendSoup,4.73,"Something they did with the hops and the malt... the BITTER is SWEET. Like, simultaneously. They are one. Poured from can into my lucky pint glass and paired with cooked-from-frozen orange chicken. Amber colored with 3-finger, long-lived foamy off-white head. Smells lemony-piney, reminds me of Murphy's Oil Soap... that's a compliment, I promise, I used to be a housekeeper. Precisely zero complaints on look, smell, or taste. I do wish the foam would cut it out a little so I wasn't getting half a mouthful of it every sip, but you can't win 'em all. It is very pretty, at least. Top notch IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,TheRealLLedgerwood,2.6,"So bitter! Also, the color looks off and the bubbles are too small. I understand this is highly rated but it is not to my liking. Beer buyer beware!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,TheBricenator,4.17,"Look: Rich amber-red with a formidable eggshell head that erupts on the pour and holds as a pillow, slowly receding and leaving great lacing behind Aroma: Pine needles and sap, grapefruit, fir needles, orange, raw hop cones, and some bready malt Taste: Starts out with layers of pine and hop cones that pile on one another for prominence and followed by nice notes of freshly baked bread. Citrus fruits peek in once the conifer barrage settles down and mixes in before pine and fir return for the close Mouthfeel: Full, medium-high carbonation, and a decently dry finish with zero hint of the ABV Overall: This is good stuff and a classic. One of the first DIPA’s I had 15+ years ago and cool that they still make it and in stovepipe cans to boot. C-hops are prominent and the strong malt presence showcases this as an old-school DIPA, which I like. Tasty and fun to try again after many years",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,DrOfGolf,4.71,"Poured out as a copperish color with a foamy head that slowly subsides. The smell is of malt plus a nice hoppy aroma.

10099,2093,MadMadMike,4.23,"12 oz bottle from a 6 pack. Right fine IPA. Balanced bitter & malt. It’s got the look, the pungent aroma that non-IPA people hate, a nice long finish. Recycle. Repeat.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Saluki,4.35,"Looks and smells good. What matters most is taste and this is not a light weight, which it isn't supposed to be. Heavy on the malt would be only criticism.

10099,2093,Shiredave,4.26,"Large format 19oz. can with NOV 2022 stamped on the bottom. This pours a beautiful, medium orange-amber color, gloriously clear with a tall head of off-white that peppered the glass with lace. The aroma is less than I remember - more citrus than 20 years ago and less malt sweetness in the nose. Some caramel and grain notes are there but not the blast of scents this had when produced, in smaller, more lovingly made batches. As it warms and I swirl, more floral hops come forward as well as some more grainy wort. Flavor is much better than expected - not as rich and malty as I recall but firm in it's malt character if a bit less balanced. Hop flavors from mid/constant boil seem less, this that when it first came out defined the term ""juicy"" for beer. Mouthfeel is a bit thin but just fine for style and maybe the only improvement over the first few years when it was a bit on the heavy side. Finish is mildly and pleasantly alcoholic complimented by lingering grassy hop flavors and bitterness. This still has good balance and hop flavor w/out sacrificing malt character. Not bad for a big batch beer. A previous reviewer said "" Old school goodness"". I couldn't agree more.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Vykk_Draygo,4.51,"Amber, with good clarity. Head pours moderately thick (about a finger), and is an off-white eggshell color. Fade to a persistent cap with little lacing.  Aroma is initially malt. Thick, sugary barley. Floral hops, sweet pine, lime peel, then toffee. Going back in, I get grapefruit, pineapple, and mandarin oranges.  On the palate, it's thick, sweet malt. Toffee, caramel, sugar, dried fruit, and candied orange peel. Sweet piney resin. Lasting bitterness. This is about as close as you get to a barleywine without crossing over.  The taste and aroma continue to evolve as it warms. The malt becomes more prominent, but it always finishes with a pleasant piney bitterness. Overall, this is a delicious beer that is right up my alley. I love that orange hop flavor coupled with thick barley malt.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,mactrail,3.58,"Clear orange amber brew is quite handsome in the tall goblet with abundant foam. Hugely hoppy and quite bitter, but not too unpleasant. Interesting dark roasted malty taste. Grapefruit and piney hops.  Distinctive woody taste. Just the thing to hop up some Blonde Ale I am stuck with. From the 19.325 oz can.

10099,2093,Perioddicals,4.41,L - Poured from a 12 ounce can into a Dogfish Head IP Glass. Two finger off-white head. Pours golden and hazy. Decent lacing.  S - Bitter citrus and floral IPA scent  T - Taste is more complex than scent. Has some maltiness to balance the bitter floral and citrus. Very balanced for an IPA. Each taste goes back and forth between malt and hop.  F - Nice medium oily feel.  O - Top notch IPA. Drank the same night as 60 Min IPA. Both are wonderful beers that are definitely in my annual rotation. The 60 Minute is the IPA standard for me.

S: mostly tropical fruit, some pine, a hint of malt.  T: a nice piney bitterness, grapefruit tartness, a touch of sweetness, and a bittersweet hoppy roasted malt finish.  F: a full viscous body, similar to a good barrel aged stout. Creamy and coats the tongue. Beautiful execution for a dipa.  O: an above average ipa in every aspect. The mouth feel was my favorite part, but there were no major weaknesses. Definitely a better ipa for malt centric beer lovers.

Taste: Grapefruit up front, plenty of herbal and grassy notes follow. Bitterness is there but it isn't unpleasant. Malt is doing a great job balancing all those hops. There's some bread crust and a really nice toasted note that lingers on.  Feel: Medium bodied. Plenty of carbonation. Chewy but refreshing. I can't feel any alcohol warmth at all.

Never mind the impressive for me off-white head and hazy deep golden hue, the aroma and taste were cursed by what I believe is some kind of malt extract. very artificial tasting which for me, ranks this beer below most Malt liquors. Maybe the Can recipe is different from the six pack recipe? Extremely disappointed.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,bobwm,4.75,A great balance of hops with the sweet malt base. The warming nature of this beer just mellows you out. By far one of the the best beers by Dogfish Head.

Bouquet: Dry pine needles, dehydrated orange peel and a unique sweetness that hits like mild pineapple and lemon drops sunken in a deep pool of amber malts.  Feel: Touches down like an American strong ale fortified with luscious hop oils. Low but unyielding carbonation whets the citrus and hop bitters present.  Taste: A hard edge of bitter hops tempered by a thick quilt of malts sweetened with fructose and a few scant drops of table syrup.

It was one of the first imperial IPAs that I tried. That version of this beer was very hoppy, fruity, and had bursts of citrus hop flavor. This current version is just too sweet and malty for my taste. Dog Fish Heads brewmaster at the time decided that this beer needed to be held back for a certain degree of time before it was actually distributed. That decision in my opinion was horrible. I have always had the impression that this brewmaster had no idea what a hop bomb was all about. I still feel that way now. This beer taste like more like an imperial Bluepoint toasted lager more than an imperial IPA. This beer is forever ruined even if it's only a week old, and I've actually had it that fresh.

So, when the local gas station surprisingly had this it brought memories of yesteryear. I was not disappointed! Outstanding on all levels.

10099,2093,JJKBeerLvr,4.45,"Poured from a 12-oz bottle into pint glass in June 2021. There was no brewed date on the label. I drank this less about 1 month after purchase.  Appearance: Deep gold color with huge white head. It is a bright and has a clear color, like other IPAs. Head is very thick, and it lasts a minute time, leaving a small covering. There is a lot of lacing on the glass.  Smell: The aroma filled the room while the beer was being poured. Strong aroma of citrus, pine, and hops, as well as some sweetness like pineapple. Also, a little earthy or straw aroma. Overall, the citrus aroma dominates the other aromas.  Taste: Sweet taste with a strong bitter hops edge. There is also a nice malt sweetness as well. This matches the 'powerful malt backbone' statement on the label. There is a typical hops and citrus flavor, but with some sweetness as well. This is bitter like most other IPAs. Has a very nice after-taste that lasts a long time. Overall a nice balance and very drinkable.  Mouthfeel: Medium-Strong bodied, which makes this very drinkable. Medium-Strong alcohol, which matches the 9.0% listed.  This is a very good and interesting IPA. It has a nice mix of citrus, grapefruit, hops, malt, and other flavors, which makes it enjoyable. I like the overall balance, and that the citrus flavors are pronounced but do not dominate the flavor. It has more of a hop edge than many other IPAs. This would be a good IPA to drink often.

10099,2093,blazerkor,4.34,"It smells so fresh.  There is sweetness and a citrussy fruit scent.  It almost smells like a hoppy pear.  The sweetness is still there when I taste it but more prominent is the complexity of both citrus and dank hops and bitterness.  It's light and refreshing. It feels smooth, sudsy and easy to drink. The aftertaste is long lasting and politely bitter.  Overall it's a really good IPA. I love how every brewery's IPAs have their own distinctive taste and this one has it's.  Delicious really.

Smell is floral and sweet, with hints of orange and mango. The taste, oh the taste. The body is heavily floral, with hints of cherry, orange, and vanilla. The hops come out on the finish, slightly dank, but the bitterness is surprising low for an imperial. The feel is creamy, and you’re left with a rich coating on your tongue, which I assume comes from the high ABV. This is my new favorite IPA. It’s as rich in its own right as most barrel aged stouts, and balances sweet and bitter amazingly.

10099,2093,BerkeleyBeerSleuth,3.97,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into a 16 oz pint glass. Bottle says best by August 2021 so I imagine this beer is about halfway through it's shelf life.   This is the first imperial IPA I ever had but I never got around to reviewing it. All I remember from years ago is it went down like beer punch. Let's dive into a proper review of this classic.  The appearance is a dark reddish-amber with a 1inch head that clings to the sides of the glass. Right off the bat I get a whiff of ruddy caramel malts, some candy aroma. The hop aroma is more herbal than piney. Some citrus aroma, and hints of blueberry. The taste is on the malt side, the hops really don't jump out off this one. Rasberry black tea like flavor. Pie crust. Refreshing flavor, just slightly chewy. Lingering malt finish. The alcohol is well concealed. This is such an easy drinking beer. I always referred to it as a classic east coast IPA (before the whole hazy New England IPA thing). It doesn't have the bitter hop astringency or tropical flavors of for example a Lagunitas or Green Flash west coast IPA. Rather this beer is bordering on being a light barleywine. Darken it just a tad more and up the abv and it woud be into barleywine territory.  Overall, not quite as good as I remember, but still very good. A unique alternative to the face melting bitterness of a lot of the IPA's I am used to drinking.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Fragmented sheets of lacing. Aroma is citrus and pine hops with a malt backbone. Taste is sweet caramel malt, with a hop punch that is dank, piney, with a bit of citrus. Aftertaste is a sweet caramel and pine candy bar. Fuller mouth feel, and an invitation to swirl the beer in the mouth. Very good carbonation. Has a bit of a dry finish due to the alcohol percentage.

The color looks like a typical pale ale. The malt tries to get in there, but the hops quickly usurp the flavor. It's not a citrus flavor like cascade, but a pleasant bitterness nonetheless.

10099,2093,mikeinportc,4.32,"Botted 07/01/20. At 75 days, probably the freshest I've seen/had it, so might as well review it. :)  Slightly hazy orange-amber, with light, creamy, off-white head.  Smell is candied citrus rind - mostly orange, a deep, rich, rounded pine smell, toffee, and a sweet, bread+honey malt aroma.  Taste is similar to aroma, but milder, and more evenly balanced.Starts with a syrupy orange flavor, followed by light pine, then a blend of toffee,bread , and floral & herbal hop flavor. Light-moderate bitterness balances the sweeter elements. In actuality, it's probably more bitter than I'm perceiving it, given what it's countering, but it's not that noticeable.  Feel is medium, initially mildly creamy, becoming lightly prickly as the very,very fine carbonation kicks in. Leaves a syrupy coating on the tongue .  Overall, thoroughly enjoyable. A classic for a reason. Worth a try . :)",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Just an all around good looking brew.  Nose is mild toffee and caramel malt with small citrus and tropical notes. Almost has a candy like quality without being sweet. A very distinct fragrance, you know when it's 90 minute sitting in your glass.  Taste expands on everything present in the nose. A smoky, almost burnt caramel toffee presence is the most forward flavor profile. As it warms brown sugar comes through as well. The hops are on the back end. They are more subtle than a typical IPA. The malt is the star of the show and the hops are the second act. I love how different 90 minute is in this regard.  Mouthfeel is medium to fullbodied with mild carbonation. A nice density. A little heavy. It certainly has a substantial feeling to it.  90 Minute is possibly one of my favorite ""sit back and relax"" brews. It doesn't break the bank, its smooth as hell, it's 9 percent, it's rich with flavor without being overly complex, but enough to be consistently enjoyable.

Its actually the opposite of what I thought it would be! The smell is like an aged cherry with bitterness. It smells strong and looks clear and clean, its actually pretty. Never called an IPA that.

Taste is strong, hoppy, boozy, and bitter in the best possible way at first, then lightens up a bit towards the end for a semi-sweet citrus finish. Very complex on the palate.  Feel is not as heavy as you might expect from a 9ish% beer. It is strong, but doesn’t completely obliterate your taste buds. Carbonation is on the high side of medium.

It’s complex, take your time drinking it and noting different aspects as you taste each sip. Changes with temp too - start cold and enjoy the changes as it warms up.

Alcohol isn't really noticeable, and I'm sure it is hard to hide it at that ABV.  O---Effing awesome. I have no idea how I've never had this one living in the Philly area my whole life. I will definitely be getting more of this one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

It is a champion product for IPA’s. I guess in a word, “balanced” is the right choice, but make no mistake, this beer hits the high notes, and delivers on the quality scales. Unfortunately due to the laws of supply and demand, which I totally get and applaud, the price in NJ is up to $13.99 for a six pack. That should tell you everything you need to know. Still, it’s totally worth it. Sorry guys.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Sdberg99,5,Simply put - this is the best IPA ever. I have tried them all from Heady to Pliny to Hopslam to Sculpin and Zombie (all tasty) and everything in between. I love a good bourbon stout and a Pilsner but make no mistake if I were left to one beer for the rest of my life - that’s a sad proposition- it will be 90 minute.

10099,2093,Bsimpson91,4.9,"Exceptional Beer in every way possible! Beautiful rich aroma. Candied sugar, Caramelized Malt, nuanced with hints pine and citrus. The taste is Invitingly sweet and sticky along with a citrusy build up of hop flavor without the bitterness. In the front, you get a supreme Malt character that is full of depth and complexity throughout the entire sip. Reminds me of new Oak aged homemade wine, full of that glazed donut or Red velvet cake richness. The hops do a great job to level out the sweetness without crushing you with bitterness.The middle is a swell of complex flavors that just carry you off to Nirvana. The finish is warm like a mellowed whiskey. The Body of the beer matches up well with the flavor. Low Carbonation, Medium to full body, creamy texture on the pallett. Smooth as silk. This beer would go very well with a heavy Dinner. Char broiled Steak, Barbecued Pork shoulder, would pare well with a very sharp cheddar.

10099,2093,defunksta,3.92,"Appearance: Pours an amber color that is bright. Has an apricot hue. A mild, but sticky head. Aroma: A citrus hop aroma that is overshadowed by an overwhelming candiedsugar malt sweetness that reminds me of a Belgian Tripel. Flavor: Strong bitterness upfront. A candiedsugar sweetness evolves into a dark fruit and roasted sweetness. The bitterness with dark fruit sweetness reminds me of an imperial stout. A slight citrus and candiedsugar that evolves into a dark fruit and roasted toffee & caramel malt profile. This is very similar to a barleywine. Alcohol is apparent. More malt and less hop flavor than I would expect for the higher imperial IPA status. Feel: Heavy, oily. Smooth. Alcohol is appreciable, but balanced in the strong malty sweetness. Not too dry and some sweetness is appreciable.  Overall: Definitional a malt focused IPA that has darker flavors than your average IPA. Candied sugar followed by darker fruit and roasted toffee. It drinks like a darker tripel without the Belgian spice. I would actually describe this beer very similar to a barley-wine. Has the appropriate hop flavors and bitterness, but focuses so much more on the darker and sweet hop profile.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,Dyldey,3.29,"A very good beer before IPA’s began blowing up in a town near you. Too malty for my taste and the feel is mass produced at this point. Again, this was a very good beer before everyone had a local brewery squeezing fresh IPA’s weekly that were packed with citra and simcoe. Compared to the mass produced it’s good - compared to your local brewery - not fair at this point. I give a ton of credit to dog fish for pushing the limits when no one was doing it. IMO they were the trailblazers to the freshly squeezed beers. Now there is just so much fresh, local beer that it’s tough for them to even compete. I have been to their brewery and they have great suds...but if we’re rating the 90 minute it’s gone from great (8 years ago little competition) to present day average and decent if nothing else is available.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Smells of pine and a bit of alcohol, not overpowering. Maybe just a hint of sweet floral in there as well.  Tastes of bitter pine resin with a bit of alcohol heat. For a beer this big, there isn't a lot of malty sweetness. It's there, just not as prominent as in some of the other DIPAs/TIPAs I've had.  This is one well balanced beer-not a chore to drink at all. Combo of bitter hops and alcohol on the aftertaste.  Overall...I'm not a hater on 60 Minute, but this is a much better put together beer IMO. It's about 30 minutes bigger :) And a standout in the big DIPA category by not carrying a strong malty sweetness.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Tastes of malt caramel, some floral hop character & alcohol. It has a nice nose & some subtle lacing. Something along the lines of candied apple, perhaps melon.

Hop aroma is there, but somewhat muted. Hints of alcohol in the nose.  Big hit of malt, hops, and alcohol right off the bat. Malt gives way to hop flavor (mostly pine to me) and alcohol as it progresses. Overall a fairly nice balance that shifts slightly hoppy late. A more unified flavor profile than many DIPA examples.  Med-full body and medium carbonation. Has a fairly smooth mouthfeel, and just a bit of alcohol warming on the backend.  A style that generally isn't my cup of tea, but a pleasant and drinkable example from DFH.

Hoppish scent that was slightly more than a malty nose with a bit of alcohol. Taste is truly one of a kind. As an imperial ipa you would think was piney or bitter. Not at all. Depending on your taste, great or disappointed. I enjoy the crispness of the hops with this smoothness of the malt. A very clean finish with a tingly carbonation at the end. For an imperial this has a light mouth feel. Very drinkable with rich easy slight alcohol finish. A true ipa fan will probably be dissatisfied with this but I found it to be a great, refreshing beer regardless of where it fits in the beer spectrum.

The taste is good but again, surprisingly weak tasting.

Mouthfeel is medium with a decent amount of bitterness. Actually, just about the perfect amount of bitterness.  Overall, I prefer my IPA's to tilt in the favor of more hops, less malt.

The taste follows the nose pretty closely with lots of pine needle and pine sap, crystal sweetness without cloy. Caramel and biscuit. Some citrus presence through orange zest, grapefruit, and blood orange essence. Zesty and bitter citrus rather than juice, with the pine most forward. Crisp and clean overall.

10099,2093,Rug,4.31,"So, I'm revisiting this, my first review, directly after my 1000th review. This is a classic that I need to revisit and properly review. Updated 2/26/22, best by 7/22. Let's get into it  Pours a clear orange gold with 3 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing. Going up a quarter point  This is wonderfully balanced in the aroma, dank and sweet together. I'm picking up on aromas of resinous hops, sweet caramel, orange rind, bready malt, light grapefruit, and toffee. Going up a quarter point  The taste follows the nose pretty closely in this beer, an admirable quality for a classic. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting orange rind, bready malt, caramel, piney hops, white pepper, and light grapefruit. The swallow brings notes of resinous hops, toffee, bready malt, white pepper, orange marmalade, and grapefruit. Going up a quarter point  A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a creamy yet crisp beer. Finishes mostly dry with a nice balance. Going up 3 quarters of a point  Well, this is certainly better than when I first reviewed it. But I think that's less of a reflection on the beer than it is on my palate over 1000 reviews. All scores have gone up, overall going up by a half point  ----------------------------------------------------------  Bottled 8/1/18, Original Review 10/29/18  Picked up a sixer and will definitely age some of this. Clearish orange color with a two finger head, smells of piney, fruity, floral hops. The taste is unfamiliar and dark at first, but settles to a sweet and bitter tropical taste. Very floral and hoppy on the aftertaste. A thinner mouthfeel than expected but with moderate carbonation. IPA is not my favorite style, but DFH did a damn good job on this one. Truly a classic brew, highly complex but balanced.  Original score: 3.96/5 rDev -7.3% look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75  EDIT 2/4/19: After 6 months of sitting on this same batch, it has mellowed in an interesting fashion, the hops are inconsistent, only coming through in certain sips. The stone fruit character is brought out by this, which hides the 9% ABV very well. It's hard to say if after 6 months the quality has gone up or down, so I will leave the rating the same. It's different, but still fantastic. I look forward to trying it after a year  EDIT 8/1/19: It was bottled exactly a year ago, and coincidentally it’s IPA Day! After a year, this is nearly an all out malt bomb. It has lost its’ signature hop characteristics completely and almost tastes like a different style, perhaps a blonde ale. Once again, I will leave my rating the same as it wouldn’t be fair to lower it after a year, even though it doesn’t really hold up. I have 1 more, so I might as well just give it another year  EDIT 9/14/20: Back to the same batch of the first beer I reviewed once more. I’ve learned so much about beer since then and have grown to appreciate so many styles and flavors. 2+ years in the cellar. A lot of sweeter molasses and sherry appear in both the flavor and the aroma, lending to a smooth sweetish citrus vibe. The hops are still present in the back end but thing crazy. Still very good after all this time and I’ll always look back on this beer with nostalgia",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

When they say that there's a malt backbone, they weren't kidding. Perfect balance between the hops and malt, shining together in perfect harmony. There's a creaminess, richness, caramel, nuttiness, spices, sweetness, and a whole lot of flavors I can't quite pick out.  O: One of the best imperial IPAs I've had.

10099,2093,DoghouseReilly3946,3.89,"Dogfish Head 90 Minute IIPA - 9% ABV - 90 IBUs Date: 08/01/18, enjoyed on 09/05/18. Appearance: Deep rich copper color with two fingers of off white head. Aroma: Sweet malts up front followed by a pleasant but somewhat restrained dank hop aroma. There are some sweet tropical fruit aromas as well, such as pineapple and mango. Overall, 90 Minute is wonderfully aromatic and juicy. Taste: The nose would led one to believe that this was going to be more malt driven, however, the first sip reveals a very balanced relationship between the hops and malts. Sticky and resiny Pine hop flavors come out on the taste more as well. While it is balanced, there is a big sweet bread malts character to combat the intense hopping this beer gets. Tropical fruits from the aroma are here as well, but are harder to nail down to a specific fruit. As the beer warms, it gets sweeter and stickier and exhibits a nice full palate coating mouthfeel. Biased comments: Its a classic, what else can I say that hasn’t been said. Its a totally enjoyable palate wrecker, that is perhaps a tad too sweet, but has a place in my fridge anyway. Also, its now in six packs.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Profundobaso,4.28,"Look - poured from a 12 oz bottle. Light copper in color, a small half-inch head with lacing. Smell - surprisingly, malts first, then hops. slightly sweet. would not think this is an imperial IPA just from the smell alone. Taste - once again, a dominant malt presence that is supplemented by strong, but not overpowering, hoppy flavor. a fairly sweet finish, with a bit of warmness in the end from the booze. a really nice experience. Feel - medium bodied, light to moderate carbonation, and heavy on ABV at 9%. however, alcohol is well masked and not too detectable, especially when cold. Overall - a really, really good beer, and a thoroughly enjoyable IPA. Unlike the trend of current craft IPAs, 90 Minute's malty backbone has always made it an extremely balanced beer, and easily approachable by many. A great go-to beer for any occasion.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Thick foam head trickles away leaving good lacing on glass Smell - Bottled only a month ago but not much of an aroma. Malt and some floral hops. A Belgian note. Taste - Powerful flavor. Malt is the main thing, like biscuits and french toast but the hops are very present as well. Fairly sweet. Extremely well balanced, not much bitterness and cannot pick up the alcohol much even at 9% ABV. Carbonation is medium-low. Certainly a medium-heavy body, not a beer that will be good for parties. The thing i like about the hop profile is that it isn't really grapefruit, its more earthy, piney, oily.  Overall, a really good brew.

10099,2093,Billybrewer,4.96,"I believe this is the best ipa in America. Pleasantly in between the 60 minute and 90 minute, it adds mor3 bitterness than the 60 minute with the experience of the 120 without the hangover regrets (usually). It has the best aroma Imo. The owner of DFH designed his ipas in a very grass roots way. He used a converted vibrating football game popular from the 1950s, and used it’s vibrating action to add hops over time to his beer. While this may sound strange, it’s this approach to experimentation that was the basis for Sams small batch microbrewery. My feeling is that this experimental approach is so engrained in its culture, that it will continue to turn out awesome beers for a very long time that break new ground. While they have amaging ipas of many types, my favorite is the 90 minute. It’s a bit more expensive than 60 minute, and hard to find, but if you see it, buy it.

10099,2093,Mindcrime1000,4.1,"For rating number 200--a long time favorite of others that just finally became available here on the barren prairie...  One of the prettiest IPA's I've seen. Amber and shimmering with just a touch of haze and a fantastic head that lasts and lasts.  Despite being an IPA, this brew has a strong malt presence on the nose, although the hops deliver in mostly a floral way. The aroma overall is somewhat muted and a little disappointing given the billing and notoriety--still, on its own merits a fine aroma.  The flavor comes to the rescue though. Again, a strong malt backbone that presents with tropical-fruit sweetness and nuttiness, followed by a wallop of both floral and citrus/piney hoppiness. Not devastating but definitely tongue-tingling with just a touch of background booze. Excellent.  The mouthfeel is very complex. The strong malt base brings a viscous, almost chewy character, but the booze and carbonation thin it to a crisp, though definitely not dry, finish. Substantial but not heavy, and not sticky.  Overall, a yummy 200th brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Ahypercube,2.5,"So for my 99th review, I have one of the most highly regarded brews in the world here. For number 100, I've got an even more special something: my first true whale beer, Pliny The Elder. Super excited to drink that. This one, on the other hand, I'm just trying to get out of the way.  I wanted to like this beer a lot. I've picked it up a few times. The first time I figured I must have gotten a bad batch. By the third time, I had had enough. It's been over a year since I've bothered with this brewery. But I figured I'd review this trash and say my piece:  This is the most overrated beer in the world.  L: The idea of it is very satisfying mathematically (90 minute boil, 90 IBUs, 9% ABV, yada yada yada) and when poured into a glass, the perfectly clear viscous amber body and the persistence of that creamy beige head indicate that this could very well be an excellent beer.  S: Unfortunately the illusion breaks there. Almost no hop presence in this crap. 90 IBUs is probably a measurement from a pre-2010 batch that they still get to claim despite converting production toward a shit product with cheap ingredients. Sitting under my nose, it drags up whiffs of oxidized wheat crust, overcooked carrot, peach, some apricot, green apple peel, agave nectar, milk chocolate and honey. A touch of sage on the finish indicates that it does indeed contain some hops.  T: Tastes like a cheap imperial red ale. Tons of stale bread crust, canned peaches, canned mandarin, caramel, milk chocolate, and stale barley malt. Blechh. Can barely get through a bottle without chugging most of it.  F: What can be said about this beer is that it does not bother you with it's repulsive flavor for very long. On top of that, it has a very smooth and creamy texture.  O: From reading a few reviews on this site, I've noticed that those dating pre-2006 are, without a doubt, describing a completely different beer than those dating post-2010. That would be a great explanation for why this beer that deserves a rating closer to that of Shock Top has the world-class numbers it's working with. If you want to try a beer that tastes like this, I recommend you try Trader Joe's Drive-Thru Red Ale.

Through the bottle neck, I can smell malty sweetness with some hops, not so much citrus but more earthy/piney (likely a bit too old for any citrus to remain). Sipping gives a touch of carbonation and the taste matches the smell, similar hop flavors, mainly malt. It starts piney, goes into malt fairly quickly and for a while, then after the malt fades a bit of bitterness and dryness rises to finish it off.

Despite its reputation as a strong IPA with a lot of hoppy notes, it's incredibly balanced.  Feel: A little thin and highly carbonated.

Aroma is caramel malty up front, earthy & piney hops, some citrus fruit at the end. Definitely a changeup from the fruity/piney/danky aroma profile of West Coast IPAs & DIPAs I'm used to.  Taste is earthy, malty & piney like the aroma. The fruit honestly taste more like dark fruit here than citrus. It is a nice mix, but very different from most IPAs and DIPAs out.  Mouthfeel is where this brew shines, very balanced all around, booze well contained, solid bitterness, clean & dry finish.  Overall, a very well-crafted DIPA that's really not about the fruitiness, which is just different from pretty much the rest of the market.

Not only did he tell me it would change my life, but it would affect how I did things from here on out. It did change my life, and it started with the 90 minute IPA by Dogfish Head. I was working at a winery at the time, but it was so snowy outside (oregon terms) because of this, work was cancelled. I was still able to drive around with four-wheel drive, so I listen to my peers and seeked out a location where I could get my hands on this elusive beer. I purchased a four pack and brought it back to Monmouth. The ensuing hours later provided plenty of entertainment and joy.

I’m unsure how much I like this. I’m glad I tried it though. Pretty easy to drink for a 9% beer.

10099,2093,Pantalones,4.24,"Last bottle of a 4-pack split between my sister and I (a Christmas present from my mom to both of us.) Bottling date is 10/(smudged)/17, so maybe 3 months old at most -- this one has been kept in refrigeration (bought at a grocery store, kept in fridge after) so I know it should be pretty fresh.  This is a really nice looking beer -- foam is a thin layer upon first pouring but then expands and slooowly starts to shrink back away in a fluffy cloud-like uneven way, the color is a nice dark orange, mostly clear (a bit of a haze is visible with the aid of a flashlight, but it's not like witbier/hefeweizen... or orange juice) with loads of tiny bubbles rising up in two curved streams.  Smell is somewhat mild at first, but pleasant. Fruity and piney/almost cedar-like hoppy smells are the most noticeable thing here. There's also a richer caramel-type malt in the background, compared to other IPAs I've had. After a few sips, when the foam has shrunk away just a bit, those piney hops come out in full force, becoming by far the most noticeable smell of the beer. Interestingly, toward the very end of the glass this flips around again and an almost toasted-sourdough-bread sort of thing starts to come through the wall of hop aromas. Always interesting to see a beer with flavors or smells that shift as you drink it, especially when it continues to be pleasant the whole way through.  Taste is different than a lot of other IPAs -- rather than being all hops with little to no malt, the malt seems to almost be the primary flavor, but with piney, slightly fruity, and bitter hops layered over it. The malt is rich just like in the smell, has a bit of a caramel-esque quality to it but not quite -- slightly sweet but balanced out by the bitterness of all the hops so the beer overall never really ""feels"" sweet. Getting a slightly unpleasant thing here and there that I'm not sure how to describe (maybe a wet fabric/hair sort of deal?), but it's only there for a moment and not on every sip. My glass may be to blame for that one as I don't recall tasting this ""off"" flavor in the bottle I had before the current four-pack (a much older bottle, almost gave a ""lite barleywine"" impression more than IPA, but still pretty good), which I drank from a different glass when visiting family a while back. Since I only noticed that thing once or twice each time, and only in this glass, I'm blaming the glass and not letting it affect my score of the beer itself. Burps are nice piney hop flavor all the way. At first I wasn't super impressed but this is really growing on me the more I drink.  Feel is light and crisp at first, then more substantial-feeling. A little odd to transition from one extreme to the other like that, but it works! There's a hop-oily lingering feeling in the mouth for a while after a sip or two, and the bitterness, while never seeming at all harsh or overwhelming, somehow seems to go all the way down the back of your throat as you swallow a sip of the beer rather than only being felt/tasted on the tongue. Seems heavier than a lot of IPAs, which I suppose makes sense considering that it's 9% ABV and this was (if I recall my beer history correctly) one of the ""OG"" double IPAs back before ""double IPA"" was even really a defined thing.  So here's a confession -- I glanced at the average score and went into this review (based on my impressions of the previous bottle) thinking that there was no way I'd give this beer a 4.2ish average, maybe a high 3-somethings or an even 4 at best. And then as I actually drank the beer and put my thoughts down and converted them into numbers... I found myself enjoying it more and more from one sip to the next. This is a beer that grows on you, for sure -- if you tried it just once and weren't a fan (or even thought it was ""good but not great""), I would recommend you give it another chance. This was definitely a lesson in why my policy of always trying a beer twice before putting your thoughts down in a review is a good idea -- some beers just get better the second, or third, or fourth time you drink them.

The aroma is rich and overall sweet, with melon, orange, light resin, and cotton candy covering down on the hops.  Very sweet and malty. Distinct flavors of caramel, pudding, orange marmalade, and cotton candy.  This beer is medium bodied, slick, and has enough carbonation to stand up to the sweetness and viscosity.  At just over a month old, this isn't the hop bomb of reputation. Based on this OG east coast IPA, I can see where the reputation they have for being malty comes from. It carries the alcohol well, has some good hop flavor, and the sweetness and bitterness are subtly balanced.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Retention and lacing are above average. The aroma is faint caramel and faint citrus/pine. The taste is semisweet caramel with a citrus undertone that transitions to piney moderate bitterness with a touch of alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, adequately carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. There is some residual hop oil and unfermented sugar that keep the feel sticky, but not cloying. Overall, very good. A classic east coast IPA. Still enjoyable, but not nearly best in class.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Thick cap retains well. Moderate lacing.  S: super resiny, sweet, candied citrus and a touch of pineapple. Navel oranges. A little boozy and syrupy on the nose. Behind the feel, the smell of this beer is perfect DIPA.  T: bitter, boozy arrival. Alcohol and hops. Malt across the middle stops just short of sweet. Lingering sweet but slightly unripe orange citrusy bitterness.  M: heavier end of midweight, moderately high carbonation. Surprisingly clean. Actually the mouthfeel may be the strongest part of this beer.  O: reminds me of sixpoint resin. Full hoppy citrusy sweet aroma and a malty but not sweet and powerful palate.

10099,2093,-steve-,3.5,"Poured into a standard pint glass. Slight tinge of orange colour to this beer that I was not expecting (although there is no reason why it shouldn't have some orange in it). Nice citrus particularly orange comes through on the nose. Malt (caramel) sweetness also evident. Massive malt sweetness and orange comes up front on tasting. As the label suggests, the malt puts the hops in its place so to speak, making the hops seems rather subdued. Overall I find the malt bill to be cloying and overpowering. I can taste more alcohol than hops. An IPA? Where's the beef?",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Foamy and almost creamy head of very light yellow, with excellent retention and sticky, chunky lacing. Opened bottle, first aroma was dough. After the pour, that gives way to a nose of dankness, aged fruit, toast, tropical fruit, white wine even, and resin or pine. Leathery and dank throughout to the taste, mostly short of perfumes or soaps which is definitely a positive, with orange and grapefruit and peach and mango as it warms and sloshes around, a medicinal booze finish, a bitter but toffee-like aftertaste, and rindy retro-olfaction. Medium-bodied, silky smooth at first with slowly-rising fine and tingly carbonation bringing the texture closer to cream. Less alcoholic heat than ABV would generally indicate.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

( Which I also enjoy very much) Mild fresh baked bread, flowers. Feels smooth and quaffable for a 9% ABV. Not too slick, Not too dry. Delicious example. Again Kudos to DFH !!

Cherries are very prominent in the smell, with other notes of pineapple, melon, mango, pear, and red apples. Roasted toffee and caramel are present as well.  A mix of cherry and orange peel smoothly flood the mouth delicately with very notable creamy carbonation, with a following grapefruit peel and hoppy aftertaste that balances the malty goodness. Dark fruit, melon, syrup, and candied sugar provide a sweetness to the beer too, along with different spices.

S: Hoppy and piney, with potentially a hint of tobacco smell mixed into this orangy concoction T: so drinkable, honestly tastes great. Dangerous because of it's lack of kick.

10099,2093,spectru,4.07,"7/29/2017 - Deep golden color, slightly hazy, with a creamy foamy head. Head retention is pretty good. Nice aroma, with a hint of alcohol. Rich smooth taste, not bitter.  Dogfish Head taste test: 60 Minute IPA vs 90 Minute IPA The 90 Minute is slightly darker and has a creamier foamier head. The 60 minute is milder, the 90 minute sharper. 60 minute = 6% alc. 90 minute = 9% alc. By the time you finish them both, the taste test really doesn't matter so much.  90 Minute IPA is my favorite IPA, so far.  1/18/2021 - 90 Minute has moved to a back burner for me. I've been drinking other IPAs. I like hazy IPAs e.g. Hazy Voodoo Ranger. And drinking 90 Minute much less, but occasionally. Tonight I had a glass of it and hardly noticed it. I must be becoming beer jaded. Adjusted rating from 4.42 to 4.0  9/24/2021 - Haven't had one for a while. Been drinking Juicy Haze Voodoo Ranger lately. Thought I'd give my old friend 90 Minute a visit. So a new review and then I'll see how it compares to my first one. Perfectly clear, a nice darkish amber. small cream colored head recedes to a persistent cap, some lacing, and nice, a gentle slosh paints the glass with lace and forms a good rim around the head. It's a nice looking beer I think I'll raise the Look score from 4 to 4.25; I smell almost nothing - my sniffer is dead; I'm almost surprised by the flavor: smooth, rich, calmly robust - not bad at all and not how I remembered it. This tastes good with no hint of harshness. No wonder I liked this beer so much. It's much smoother and not as sharp as I remember it. I'm gonna bump the taste score up from 4 as well; Mouthfeel is much subdued over my memory of it - meh. The feel score drops from 4 to 3.5; Overall I'll give it a Four, I guess. Flavor gets a little sourish near the end.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,davisrs,4.75,"NOTE: I compare all other beers to Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale; there may be better out there, but many that are worse. This gives a 2 finger aromatic head that lasts. The color is a cloudy dark straw. There is slight aroma from malt and hops. There is a really nice balance of taste from malt and hops which is more citrusy than Sierra Nevada. Bitterness is fully balanced throughout the palate with a hint of malt which offers a smooth finish. Very little bitter aftertaste. perfectly balanced flavor! Definitely not as bitter as Sierra Nevada 40 IBU or Torpedo 65 IBU.

This is a much finer beer than I remember because, for one thing, I've learned to appreciate more malty notes; but mostly it's because Dogfish Head is a great brewery. I would say the flavor is more like a (very) hoppy barleywine. Which, with my current palate, suits me just fine.

Earthy, biscuit malts swell up in the middle before stepping out of the way of the hop finish. Mouth feel is thick, with a huge, velvety texture. It's quite filling. Overall, this beer is 9% and definitely carries the presence of a 9% beer. While not extremely high, it is in dangerous territory.

10099,2093,GHow,4.93,I purchased a single Dog Fish Head 90 minute at local for a tasting. Poured a super chilled bottle into a glass that presented a IIPA smokey orange red glow. DFH 90 pours fine foam head and leaves a great lacing to my glass after each sip. No over powering hop aroma that would register on anyone’s 'skunky beer meter. ' Its smooth malt hop flavor has no palate harsh biting after shock even for a 90 IBU. Somewhat sweet flavor that could disguise the alcohol kick that comes with this fine imperil. I would recommend this to anyone’s rotation pool.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Bullyy56,4.38,"I probably shouldn't have had this one on the same night as Stone's Enjoy by, but at least I can tell the difference between these two imperial IPAs. The look is a lovely Amber-orange, a very nice foamy head, not quite off white and rich looking The smell is a bit subdued, but you still get all the notes of grapefruit, some other tropical fruits, and a slight sweetness from the malt. The taste is almost exactly like the nose, the hops are also subdued initially, but as the beer warms up you can get more of the hop-bitterness on the back end, backed up by that lovely malt backbone. The mouthfeel is what I call a rich lightness bordering on medium. Very smooth all the way through, a highly drinkable DIPA. Overall, what I get from this beer is that its a subdued version of Stone's Enjoy By, which ain't such a bad thing. Since this is more readily available in my area, it probably would be my go to DIPA (Until I try more of Lagunitas' stuff, that is). It's definitely an enjoyable, outstanding beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Stephenmheadley,4.14,"Dark coppery color from the rich malt in the beer, this is a serious double IPA.

10099,2093,AdmiralOzone,4.27,"Clear dark honey amber color with a beautiful cloudy white head that dissipates to a small layer of lacy topping that clings to the glass. Aroma is grapefruit, pineapple, pine and caramel. The flavor is a very nice mixture of bitter and sweet. The feel of this beer is it's only weak point in my opinion, as I feel it needs a touch more carbonation.

10099,2093,rw_0121,4.55,"Look is very nice and coppery. Somewhat oily looking.  The smell is fairly decent, but not among the better qualities of this extremely good beer. It's somewhat like hay.  The taste is exceptional. I'm not generally a fan of IPAs, but this is top notch. There is a good deal of complexity; which is to say a nice mix of pine, malty sweetness, and perhaps a hint of ""pale ale"" instead of IPA in there. The aftertaste has a nice ""bite"" to it, but the flavor to me wasn't quite as good as the earlier part of a drink.  Overall, a solid 4.75 . Great beer, but I'm not going to inflate the score to perfect just based on reputation. The minor factors bringing it down just a shade for me were the aftertaste and that if you keep it in your mouth a little too long, it's not quite as pleasant.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Smells hoppy and the taste is balanced nicely for people who like a strong IPA without that hoppy kick in the face. Feels just a little light. Overall, it's phenomenal. I think they got a little crazy with the malts... it has a weird kinda sweetness to it. Just a bit too much sweetness for me, but I love my hops more than I love my wife.

Has to be good to keep going back at $60 a case. This is tied with Troegs Double Bock as my favorite beer! This is a truly outstanding beer!

10099,2093,nicholas2121,4.49,"90 Minute IPA brewed by Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, with an ABV of 9.00% This American Double/ Imperial IPA pours out a deep golden amber color with a nice white head. The head of this brew is about two fingers thick. There is also a decent amount lacing to this IPA, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell of 90 Minute IPA, is rich with sweetness, earthly grains and malts. There is a mildness of hops in the smell of this brew. The look and smell are really inviting. Now for the taste, it is bold with flavors. You first pick up on the hop bitterness then the earthy grains and malts. There is also a nice amount of sweetness in the taste of this brew. It is really hard to pick up on the 9.00% AVB in this brew. It goes down that smooth. This is a nice medium to heavy bodied brew. You can feel that this IPA is heavier than most on the market, not saying that is a bad thing. The mouth feel is Bold Hoppy, Sweet, Clean and Refreshing. Overall I'm giving 90 Minute IPA a 4.50 out of 5. I would definitely buy this brew again. Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, did a super nice job with this American Double/ Imperial IPA.

This comes right on the tail of my admittedly critical review of Dogfish Head's 60 Minute IPA, and the fact that 90 minute actually saw completion before its younger cousin just might showcase a case of striking oil upon first dig. The smell is a perfect mingling of pungent, almost fruity hops, with an absolutely insane merging of hop characteristics to follow in taste. Earthiness, dankness, bitterness, the whole shebang. It finishes with a really well-rounded, mouth-filling malt backbone that wraps up the whole experience, all isolated to a single sip.  Nerdom complete. This is a good beer.

A beautiful ocher colored brew with heavenly white head, a staying power that was impressive and a lacing that was more of a sheen than lacing - very impressive. The smell was muted - not so strong with the hops, not so strong with the spices, but good nonetheless. The feel was light yet crisp and somewhat biting - something else that was unique and unlike I have experienced.

Note: Original rating was 4.25 Second review 6/29/17 ) Pours golden Amber with medium head and lacing to finish. Apparently my tastes have changed as Dogfish Head's self-described ""pungent"" smell/taste is now more a heavy influence: could not quite put my finger on it until a reader described it as a ""very hoppy barleywine"" and Dogfish Head noted ""different grains"" as influential. Bingo. Not a fan of barleywine or some grains with excessive influence. Smell, taste, aftertaste are all affected by this. Malts, hops, bitterness profile combine to overcome my bias. Personal preference leans toward several others: Green Flash West Coast IPA; Prairie Phantasmagoria; Founders Double Trouble; Stone Citracado; Stone RuinTen Triple IPA and Stone Ruination Double IPA 2.0; Sixpoint Resin, Hi-Resin & Puff; Coop Alpha Hive.

It has 9% alcohol, and I'll drink a single bottle at night only when I need a heavy hit. Otherwise, I'll drink something with less alcohol. The Dogfish Head 60 doesn't match the 90, and the Dogfish Head 120 is over the top. As with most of my beers, I buy mine at Kahns in Indianapolis where they're kept in very cold cooler and have a rapid turnover. As I've said in other reviews, the Imperial IPA hops fall off rapidly, so these beers must be drunk at once. I suspect many bad IPA reviews come from beer that has lain in the refrigerator or on the shelf too long, or not kept cold, or gone bad at tap from an old, seldom used keg. Always buy your beer from the brewery itself, or from a cooler at a liquor store with rapid turnover. Take your chances at the tap, unless it's close to the brewery, and with high turnover, such as 3 Floyds' Zombie Dust (Munster, Indiana) on tap at Wrigley Field, (Chicago).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

That's not to say that it's not hops forward- it definitely is- but the malt cuts the bitterness with a bready sweetness that I really liked.  In the overall tasting, I realized I am definitely partial to less hoppy IPAs with lower alcohol contents. A friend I was tasting with had the opposite preference; lots of hops and high alcohol. Yet at the end of the day, we both chose Dogfish 90 Minute IPA as our favorite of the group (all of which are listed below), which I think speaks to the beer's versatility and overall appeal.

10099,2093,Shadowkreep,4.61,"Beer was on draft and complemented the wings that were accompanying it. The flavor was very malty initially, but then the citrus undertones start to take over and coat your tongue very pleasantly. Not a fan of IPAs but i heard Dogfish Head has a great selection and was not let down. The head was small, almost non-existent and the color was a darker orange tone. The smell was pleasant and reflected the citrus notes. The hops were not overbearing in the traditional sense as you would think of an IPA.  Overall, it was a well crafted beer and i will enjoy it again, perhaps over a grilled cheese next time!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Zythophile,4.51,"Bottle Date: 6/15/16 Palate Contaminants: meat and potatoes  Appearance is a clear, dark amber that's really more orange. Not much head.  The smell is like a hoppy marmalade. A little malt, a little bit of floral scent. If it was a bit stronger, the grade would be even higher.  Taste has more malt and less citrus, but the degree of sweetness is in the proverbial wheelhouse for my own taste buds. There is also some bitterness up front, but it fades quickly so to not wear out its welcome. There's a good amount of earthiness, as well. The hops are the headliner, but they're there to get along with everybody. The marmalade does get stronger as it warms up.  It's definitely similar to Burton Baton, but less impactful and with a slight bit warmer feel. Not too carbonated, not too flat, just right. Not too boozy, not too thin, just right. It's easy to knock back, so be careful since it's an niner.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,IPA-enthusiast_026,3.87,"This is only my second imperial IPA that I have had, but it blows the other one away by a lot (3 floyds arctic panzer). It has that sweetness with a strong alcohol flavor, but nothing too overwhelming.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,HeadyTopperLover,3.09,I have to rate this as an IPA that fails the most important of all tasting tests. That is that you undeniably smell and taste the alcohol. To me this ruins the whole experience and I'm not liking the beer. Dogfish 60 minute is much better.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,RABouffard,3.97,Poured from growler into tulip. Pleasent tropical fruit hop charecter with a toasty (perhaps too toasty) malt backbone. A little bit of grapey booziness on the very end. Good beer but perhaps a bit overrated. Would love this beer if the malt charecter was just slightly less roasty.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Erikforreal,4,"Second IPA I've tried and I really enjoyed this one as well. Like I've said in other reviews, I'm by no means an expert but if you're looking to try and IPA, I'd give this one a go. I could see myself getting this one in the future for sure. The hoppiness is there for sure and it's got a nice flavor to it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,MacMalt,4.24,"Poured from bottle into snifter. It poured an orange-bronze color with one finger of foamy, egg-white head and extensive lacing. It smells of sweet malt, orange peel, and resinous hops. The taste is a nice blend of malt and hops: it features bready malt, sweet fruit, brown sugar, and hops. There is a slight bitterness at the finish but overall the hops don't bite. You can also taste the booze. This ale has a nice thick body, is moderately carbonated, and the 9% ABV packs a punch. Overall, this is one of the best ""malty"" IPA's available. I don't drink it a lot but when I do I enjoy it!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Rogerlb,4.03,"Pour is clear amber. Aroma is hoppy, alcohol sweet, orange peel? Taste is along those lines, I think this beer excels in its balance. Bitter hoppiness, slight booze, malt and pine, none of this overpowering. Even throughout, citrus, and it's stronger than it feels. Astringent stickiness on the tongue in the aftertaste. Hops without the bad part of being too hoppy. You know, you dodged a bullet. Now I get it.  I've had better IIPAs, but for now let's call it the best gateway Imperial IPA ever.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Mateo2699,3.81,"Pour is a clear copper, nice white frothy head with excellent lacing. The aroma has plenty of resinous hops character, with hints of tropical fruit such as mangos and peaches. No malt backbone detected in the aroma. With the taste, talk about a 360 degree turn with the ""no malt"" detection. Pretty much all I'm getting with the taste. Hints of resinous hops, but the sweet biscuit like malt is the showcase. Mouthfeel is relatively thin, but the malt profile still is mouth coating. Overall, not a bad beer that's apparently accessible in many parts of the world.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,mickyge,4.21,"No a bad DPIA a little on the fruity side, crisp mouth feel. Slightly bitter finish and a bit boozey at the end. I liked it but the higher abv, 9 %, caught me off guard.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,Bruno74200,4.27,Bottled on 11/19/15 so not very fresh (but glad to have it in Europe at all). This definitely an experience and I wouldn't rate it as a dipa because it doesn't have the profil. It's mostly on the dark fruits and the brown sugar from the malts. There is a load of pine and citrus hops. The toffee smell van make you think that's sweet but it's quite dry and balanced. Unique.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Riff,3.56,"Poured from bottle into a tulip glass. Poured out a copper color with an off white head about two fingers thick that slowly dissolved. Smells primarily of bread from the malts with a hint of pine to it. Flavor follows being primarily malt heavy with a little pine from the hops following. Flavor lingered a little, again mostly the malt. Didn't notice much bitterness from the hops or really much hop flavor as is. Feel is light with no carbonation. Overall it's a decent beer but not one I think I'll pick up again, too heavy on the malt for this style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,ronjohn,5,"IF THERE IS A BETTER IPA - I BEG YOU TO TELL ME WHAT IT IS! if any beer I've tasted deserves a perfect score, it's this one. as perfect as an IPA gets. perfect balance of malt and hops, bitter and sweet. subtle and strong. ""it's like a party in your mouth."" There are many beers that I enjoy - this one puts most of those to shame. the only issue I can take w/ this beer is that it's a bit heavy so I'm full after 2 or 3 and I like to keep going!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,krbrevard,3.12,"I get to be one of those negative reviewers. This beer gets a ton of hype but it really does not live up to it when compared to other IIPAs/DIPAs. First off, it is not balanced. The malts overpower the hops in the smell, foretaste, and midtaste. Only in the aftertaste do I get anything that resembles the sweet stickey pineyness of hops. What does that mean in the grand scheme of things? The color is spectacular but it is just an unbalanced average beer, favoring the malt side of the scale which I do not prefer. After about 30 minutes sipping, smell resembles alcohol. It know it's a 9+ percenter but other DIPAs certainly mask it much better in the aromatics and taste.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,OldSwampy,4.11,"Bronzy gold color with an abundant off-white head that leaves decent lacing on the glass. Nose of woodsy, resinous hops, but not too strong, with a definite malty presence as well. Taste: a double IPA that is malt-dominant? Hops emerge from the malt as the taste evolves, but this was not a ""hops forward"" IPA, even though the hops are obvious and tasty. The flavor is more of a back-and-forth duet between malt and hops, both making delightful contributions. Mouthfeel a little slick, moderatly sudsy as good IPAs often are. A great beer.  Bottled 3/30/2016, per the bottle stamp.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,jeffrx,5,"Great aroma and a very strong, yet enjoyable beer. I can't find anything I don't like about it. The bitterness and high ABV are not that prominent.

10099,2093,Squire,4.1,"Deep clear amber gold color with good cap and lace.  Clean aroma of rich bready malt and citrus hops.  Taste is a marvelous balance between malt and hops. I was expecting more bitterness but this is surprisingly constrained in the bitterness department. Oh, they're hops aplenty in there but a rich hop flavor comes across without accompanying bitterness. Very complex flavors well mated.  Full texture with balancing carbonation.  Altogether an outstanding brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Outstanding!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Flickerdart,4.11,"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Beer is translucent brilliant amber with half a finger of head, which quickly subsides.  Smell is malty with hints of rye. Hops are just a hint, evident only after vigorous swirling.  Taste is unexpected for something that calls itself an IPA - there is hop bitterness up front, but the lingering taste is almost biscuity. I wouldn't say malty - malts are sweeter, this is not exactly that. The mouthfeel is not very exciting - carbonation is average, it's neither chewy nor especially smooth. You can definitely taste the alcohol - there's something of a barleywine taste to it.  Overall, it's very interesting, but doesn't rise much above that for me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Beginner2,3.85,"At 15k ratings and 10% above the #2 in a style, I'm not going to add much. Plus, I should add that this is hard style for senior citizens like me to get used to... or at least drink the whole thing by myself on an empty stomach.  6/1/17 re-tasting and confirmation: too much hops and alcohol. Both interfere with normal food. But for spicy food, the high hopping works.  This is listed on the ""1001 Beers To Taste Before You Die."" You decide if it deserves to be there.

There's some hops and bitterness that clearly establish this as an ipa. There isn't a bunch of weird adjuncts. Some pine, a ton of malt and caramel.

Copper orange in colour, well filtered, with a thin white head that dissipates in a few minutes. Smells of simple malt and herbally earthy hops. No tropical and not much citrus to speak of. Easily distinguished as an imperial beer by its thick boozy, caramelly sweet feel. It's been a while since I've had 90min, and frankly I'm disappointed. It's good but not great. Spoiled by too many Vermont and west coast tropical fruity hop bombs I suppose. If you're not into that, and like the malty, potent ales, this may be the one for you",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Beertsipper,4.35,"One of my go to DIPA's. Pours a copper gold with beige head. Nose picks up in, malts, papaya, hops.. Taste follows the nose. Flavors are almost perfectly in balance.

So it's a pretty good beer, but it's not necessarily gonna be my go to when I'm looking for craft, then I remember that it's 7% abv and I file it back into the league.

10099,2093,vladdswrath,4.28,"Pours a deep but crystal clear copper with a big 2 inch head that holds form like a memory foam mattress. Smell is rich and fruity, like juicy fruit gum layered under the usual citrus and pine. The flavor follows suit, with the malt being a little sweeter than most brews yet offset by the hops being a little harsher than most. Even so, they are balanced perfectly, leaving you with an easy drink. Mouthfeel is chewy, but not oily or sticky again, very well balanced. This is a delicious brew that lives up to its reputation, although I think the industry as a whole has caught up a little bit, which makes this beer seem a little less special than it once probably was.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Look: Pours and settles a crystal clear orange color, with a thin amount of white lacing, resulting from non aggressive pour.  Smell: A lot of juicy tropical fruits up front, consisting of mangoes, and grapefruit, along with some strong notes of earth, and resiny pine along with the bitter hops.  Feel: Insanely light body, almost like air, and has a heavy amount of carbonation.  Taste: Actually seems like the opposite of the aroma. Very profound taste of the earthy resiny pine, along with some hop bitterness up front. About midway through, the juicy fruits appear, and blend into the aftertaste, along with one more bitter hop bite.  Overall: I usually steer away from the bitter beers, but do enjoy them sometimes, and I prefer the fruitier ones over the piney ones.

A biscuity note in the aroma along with a sense of sweetness, accompanying the solid hop nose that has an earthly character.  Initial taste is of caramel sweetness, followed by some mild bitterness and earthy hop flavors, rounded out by a distinct, yet moderate level of booziness.  The feel is above average with a nice carbonation level that seems to have a more delayed release, with minimal head on initial pour, but a good frothy mouth feel as it foams in the mouth.  Overall: This is a very good, malt-forward version of a double IPA, and a good break from the more common, bright and citrusy DIPAs that are hitting the market these days. The 90 min IPA has a good balance of flavors that leans a bit more in the malty caramel direction than a hop bomb.  Great beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Maybe I'm alone on the malt-bubblegum profile, but that's what I'm noticing. The most quenching IPA I've had.  F: Balanced while complex. Smooth with a sustain rigor to the beer all throughout. The feel to this beer is what really brings it all together as a world-class IPA.  O: It seems that most craft breweries aim to have the backbone of their business be a solid IPA. For some reason, IPA's dominate the craft beer market. Don't get me wrong--I love IPA beer. But a lot of times what ends up happening is you get this hop override or a misguided malt presence.

Yup, you got it. This one. Poured into a tulip, the appearance was a hazy burnt orange color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated immediately. Light stringy lacing. The smell had sweet orange, bitter citrus rind, and a light amount of grapefruit. Caramel malts play with the balance. The taste was bittersweet all of the way through. Lingering caramel to citrus aftertaste with a semi-dry finish. The mouthfeel was about medium bodied with a good sipping to sessionable sticky sweet sort of feel. Not cloying, but good.

The fact that you can get a beer of this quality and freshness (just a few weeks old) on the train is a very good sign of the state of beer culture in America. I remember when the best you could get was a skunky Heineken there.  Into a clear plastic cup, the beer is a very nice deep clear copper with a 1-finger light tan head. Smell was a little subdued, but it is more on the earthy ripe fruit side, though some pine was coming through. Some sweet malt too.  Beer tastes great. I like IIPA's like this that have some malt character to balance the hops. The feel is very good--highly drinkable but with excellent body. Neither watery nor oily, which I don't love in IPA's.

10099,2093,DavidS333,5,"90 minute double/imperial is a beer/ale, from a beer-brand which I had seen before, and hence whose Double/Imperial I was intrigued to try.  The beer its self is not too carbonated, it doesn't share the tendency that many Double/Imperial's possess whereby they bubble out of the bottle as the bottle is opened. The froth/head is smoothe smelling, and smells/tastes quite good in general.  Along a spectrum of light->medium->thick, I would consider this beer/ale of medium thickness, its color is not very transparent, and is of a sort of harvest gold color. The smell is ""seasoned"" I would say, not in the sens of suggesting the presence of seasoning(like a Christmas season IPA for ex.), but in the sense that it seems very smooth, and in a sense palatable.  The taste of the beer, is smoothe, and somewhat rich. It doesn't possess the really distinct hoppyness of some Double/Imperial's, but it does posses the pronounced hoppy aftertaste characteristic of this type of beer/ale.  The beer's hoppy distinctiveness sort of lingers around the periphery of the beers overall rich smoothness, and overall I would say this is a great relaxing beer per se. This might be a great beer to pair with steaks, with buttered asparagus for example, or with a rich-buttery white fish(like seabass/monkfish) for example, or a desert, and might hence be a good choice for a ""relaxing"" with the television or with friends in general type of beer.

10099,2093,tcoppi,4.7,"Look: Very clear amber-orange with maybe a hint of chill haze. Smell: Very citrusy, floral and malt notes with just a touch of hop resin. Not overpowering at all. Taste: Much maltier than the smell would indicate, but there are distinctive citrus notes with just the right amount of hop bitterness to balance. Very slight alcohol aftertaste, but you have to look for it. Feel: This feels like the perfect DIPA. Overall: This is exactly what I want in an IPA - great hop flavor without overpowering bitterness or resin character, and a malt backbone to hold it all together. You'd never be able to tell it was 9% until it hits you.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Cfred371,4.01,"I didn't notice, but the beer was bottled in mid June, so it's almost three months old. I'm curious if some of the taste and aroma are affected by age. Look: Amber hued with plenty carbonation. I poured somewhat aggressively with little head Smell: malts Taste: malt flavor at first with some hops coming through in the middle and then more malt Feel: about right Overall: considering what I was expecting to what it tastes like, I'm surprised and a little disappointed, but I think it's largely due to an older bottle.

Sweet malt, mixed with bitter hops and a slight amount of citrus with some caramel and biscuit notes. A slight amount of earthiness to this one as well. F - Medium body with a medium amount of carbonation. O - This is a great IPA that displays a good amount of malt and hop character. Compared to the 60 minute IPA, I believe this one has a stronger hop presence and a somewhat thicker mouthfeel with less carbonation as well as a less malty profile.

S - Smells of pine, hops, with a nice undercurrent of earthiness.  T - Very nice, well-balanced melange of Flavor and buttering hops with some pineiness and that earthiness that I love so much. Then aftertaste is a nice balance of residual malt sweetness and the last remnants of the hop earthiness.  S - good carbonation level, medium body, bit of an oily slipperiness at first that moves into a very slight dry, puckering finish.  D - Not my favorite DIPA, but probably in my top 5.

After admiring the the bronz/copper tones and big hop aroma, the taste was just what I needed, hops up front,malt in the middle, and hops on the sides, yet balanced and smooth, no boozy end flavors or astringent aftertaste.

10099,2093,taxandbeerguy,4.14,"355 ml bottle served just above fridge temperature into a Amsterdam Boneshaker snifter. Purchased while cross border shopping but it worked out to like $3.50CDN per bottle. No freshness label given.  Appearance - Medium pour yielded a dark copper colored beer with just over one finger of sparkling fluffy white head. Very modest carbonation is made up for by great retention and a swath of lacing just plastered to the glass.  Smell - Big and boozy, plenty of hops, with a decadent caramel booziness with floral notes and roasted grain in the background.  Taste - Quite sweet, not quite cloying due to lots of malt, tastes like caramel with some floral hops up front too and the roasty grain in behind. Very tasty and well put together. Mild bitterness in the aftertaste, despite 90 IBU's. Some heat arises as the alcohol content finally makes itself known. On the maltier side of DIPA's.  Mouthfeel - Smooth and sticky and the flavors cling to your mouth and lips. Carbonation is slight and the body is very full.  Overall - An excellently crafted DIPA, that delivered everything I was expecting of it. I was hoping for more of a hop dominated DIPA, but this is smooth and a very easy sipper. Would happily purchase this frequently if available in Canada.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Zonk,4.37,Definitely on the maltier side for a DIPA. Pours a light orange with thin head. Nose is a bit muted to me maybe because its less hop focused than similar brews.

The smell had a sweet grapefruit with some extra lemon and a balanced caramel malt. The taste was bittersweet fully all of the way. The mouthfeel sat about a light to medium with a decent sessionability about it. Carbonation seemed to follow the DIPA style. Nice grapefruit - sweet to bitter edge rolls over my tongue. Overall, good for the style, not sure why Esquire calls this the best IPA in the U.S. Hmmm...its good, I just don't see it being the best one.

The maltiness is also unusual for an IPA. It nicely balances the hops. 90-Minute is not sweet, though - just well-balanced. Alcohol is well hidden. Very drinkable.

10099,2093,StevenMilligan,4.4,"This may be a little biased. Poured this after finishing my final paper for my last class for my B.A.  L: Beautiful sunburnt orange, heavy one inch head that follows the beer all the way down. Good lacing too.  S: Light pine, lots of English malts.  T: Spicy hops, pine is gone. It's been replaced by medicial, herby hops. Malt backbone is very present. It carries the beer. Definitely a change up from the usual harshness of the American IPAs i frequent.  F: Thought it was going to be heavily carobnated by the pour, but it's only moderate. Mouthfeel is creamy and a little chewy, and the head...man that head sustains the duration of the beer. I don't know if I finally got my glasses clean or what. But it's exceptional.  O: Love it.

10099,2093,hopphead31415,4.05,"I love the Imperial IPAs by Dogfish Head and I also have been to a couple of their Ale houses and have tried their beer sampler, but was not sufficiently prescient to make mental notes that were detailed enough to write a review after the fact. However, I stopped at the local warehouse and picked up some of this Imperial IPA for the explicit purpose of reviewing it. It is a pleasure to do so. And with a beast like this that boasts 9% ABV and, of course, 90 IBUs, you can’t go wrong.  Look-It pours a clear golden amber color with an angry giant head which settles into a foamy soapy and delicate finger or two deep head. The lacing is absolutely beautiful and droops slightly, but has a sticky component to it.  Smell-I get grapefruit, pine, and toasted English malts. The malt variety that they chose was an excellent idea, because Esquire magazine said was “the best IPA in America”. It has a brandy and smoky bread smell, too that carries over into the taste.  Taste-The taste is toffee and citrus like grapefruit that lingers throughout the entire experience, but is also dominated late-in by an intense hop flavor and bitterness from the strong hops. The brewers boast a “ridiculous amount of English two-row Barley” that comes out toasted and delicious. I also get some resin and buttered biscuit notes.  Mouthfeel-It has a full-bodied and syrupy feel that is so pleasant and not overly sweet. Somehow, my aversion for overly sweet syrup malts has been avoided here and the barley malts are well-balanced and fine-tuned.  Overall-I would describe this beer in few words rather than many. I would describe this variety as memorable and delicious. It is fine-tuned and powerful. It is Dogfish Head! Cheers!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,NateMoss,1.94,This just doesn't do it for me at all. The English barley and malting make this taste more like a tart brown ale than an IPA.

Not bad looking, a little hazy which I like in a double Aroma of sweet malt, a little unexpected toastiness, generic citrus/piney hops but no distinct notes Flavor follows closely, sweetness and a little hidden nuttiness like you'd get from a brown ale followed by bitterness and pine resin Thick mouthfeel almost like a Guinness, not a huge fan Overall...meh. A classic, but it's been far surpassed by newer brews within the style and is now a 3rd/4th tier DIPA at best (think RJ Rockers, Terrapin, etc)",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,armystrongmd,4.44,"Served on draft at the brewery in Milton, DE.  Appearance: Clear gold/amber, thick off-white head. Medium carbonation.  Smell: Big hop aromas, fresh citrusy/piney, maybe a hint of grapefruit. Also smells a bit sweet.  Taste: The draft is much better than bottle, the bottle comes off as a bit sweet for me by comparison. This is a nice little hop explosion in the mouth without being overwhelming at all. Just a big hop flavor with a sweet malt backbone to keep it even. Supremely drinkable for a DIPA. The 9% ABV is well concealed, I would have probably guessed more like 7.5% if I did not know better.  Mouthfeel: Medium/full body, a bit thick but not when you take into account the ABV.  Overall: Quite possibly the sweet spot for, dare I say it, a session DIPA. Delicious but dangerously drinkable. This is my go-to beer as I can always find it and it's reliably excellent (unlike the 120, which is awesome but scarce and inconsistent year to year). Not as refreshing as the 60 so I typically would have one of these before or after dinner, but not during.

Taste: Rich maltiness with fruity, fig like flavors, with a toasted edge, giving way to a balanced bittereness that gradually increases in strength. Mouthfeel: Medium body with moderate carbonation Finish: Dry, resinous feeling left on the tongue, with strong but not sharp Overall: A great, classic IIPA.

10099,2093,MaximalC,3.56,"*Bottled 3/09/15  Pours a transparent amber color with more than an inch of soapy, beige foam. Simple, mild aroma smells of grapefruit, toffee, and pineapple.  The taste is predictably hop-forward, with prickly, resinous, herbaceous hops coming through straight away. Alcohol provides tangible bite that accentuates the hops. The malt profile is bready with a touch of caramel sweetness. Medium body and carbonation lay the foundation for a somewhat oily, semi-creamy mouthfeel.  Perhaps three months is just too much age for an IPA to keep its form, but this comes across a little coarse for my tastes. There’s a biting aggressiveness that just won’t quit, and it ends up overwhelming whatever details may be lurking beneath. A very different animal from its milder, 60-minute brethren.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,jmasher85,4.74,"Nailed it! This one is right in the danger zone! I had it aged quite a few years, and compared it side by side to the 60 Minute and 120 Minute. Those are both fantastic, but the 90 hits the sweet spot. Maximum hoppy power that's stronger (and I mean this guy is strong!) and more intense than 60, but not an almost overwhelmingly sickeningly rich beer bomb like the 120.

10099,2093,bassfishingguy,4.42,"12oz bottled 2/26/2015.  Appearance: Pours a bright amber color with quite a bit of white head. The lacing is very evident, as each sip leaves a personalized ring on the glass (note, enjoyed out of a pint glass rather than the suggested snifter)  Smell: Right off the bat, I get quite a bit of fresh hops. As I continue to drink this beer, I can smell something citrus and sweet. Not sure if they are part of the same flavor, or two completely different flavors.  Taste: This is a very mild/smooth beer for its style (compared to some others I've had like Hopslam), and I really like that about it. The citrus smell I was getting I can definitely taste, as well as that sweet smell. The first taste that really hits me is pine, and the rest of the flavors seem to follow with a slightly bitter hop finish.  Mouthfeel: Not quite as filling as I'd like it to be, which makes it unbelievably drinkable. For a beer 'best savored from a snifter', this one is a little too easy on the taste buds. Carbonation sounds high upon opening the bottle, but I actually got a light/moderate level of carbonation.  Overall: Being relatively new to BA (but not craft beers), I've had my eyes opened to different highly rated beers. Being relatively accessible, I want to try what I can. I was pretty impressed with the smoothness of this beer given what it has to offer.

10099,2093,dmgeng,4.6,"I've had this amazing beer before but I hadn't had a chance to review it until now.  A - Beautiful deep orange color. Mostly clear with a big bright white head and great lacing.  S - Pungent hop fragrance with lots of citrus, grapefruit, pine, and resiny tones. Could smell it before I picked it up. Almost perfume like from the magnitude of aromatics.  T - Full flavored with a ton of hop character that has citrus, resin, pine, and grapefruit. Full bitterness but it is complimented by the hop candy like sweetness on the front of the tongue. The malt is lighter and only stands to compliment which is how I like my DIPAs. It is cleaner and more of the straightforward citrus/grapefruit character than some of the new DIPAs but overall great flavor.  M - Full mouth-feel with good carbonation. This beer has all the flavor but with higher carbonation and significant bitterness this one doesn't stick to the palate profusely.  Overall, a terrific DIPA. Great aroma, flavor, feel, appearance, but with some serious hop bitterness to go great with spicy foods. There are more tropical hop flavored beers out there but this one does the more traditional West Coast style perfectly. This brew is serious on the tongue and I would strongly recommend it to anyone that likes hops.  Glass- Tulip",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,ARoman,4.39,"*transferred from old noted - 12/28/2015* Poured from tap into 10oz flute. Pleasant and mild aroma consisting mostly of hops and grass (maybe more floral than grassy) but I could pick up whiffs of citrus (orange mostly), and mild, buttery caramel. It pours sparkling golden-orange with nice finger-width, slightly off-white, head consisting of evenly sized small bubbles. This pour had the benefit of a glass which must?ve had etching on the bottom - there was a constant stream of carbonation feeding the head, giving it a presence throughout the drink (the flute has an etching on the bottom), and leaving a nice lacing around the glass by the end. Even in a plastic glass, the head retention is generous, creamy, and fluffy and has a lot of sheet lace. The taste is a balanced medium high, citrus bittersweet. It?s a nice, medium body, a bit sticky with a mild hop flavor lingering. The constant head gives it the benefit of being creamy and frothy throughout, but it doesn?t feel fizzy at all. It’s a medium body, a bit sticky, that’s creamy and thick but also smooth with flavors of bread toast, biscuit, and caramel with some citrus. There?s a reason Dogfish Head gets so much credit for their beers, and this is a shining example of how to make and Imperial IPA without over-doing any aspect of it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,m_hall,4.32,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip. A hazy orange-amber ale topped with an off-white one-finger head that has decent retention. Very good lacing, as to be expected from a heavily-hopped ale.  Aroma is sweet, citrus fruits, vanilla, garnished with a floral hop overtone. Not as pungent as many IPAs, though.  Flavors are rich fruits, banana, caramel malts, light, pastry-like breads up front. Grapefruit, lemon zest, and pine-y hop notes come in strong after, but the strength of the malt backbone keeps the 90 IBU bitterness from devastating the taste buds. Finish is fairly long and sweet/sour, accompanied by a noticeable alcohol warmth.  Mouthfeel is smooth and and not overly heavy. The body of this rather malt-heavy beer is offset by a fairly strong carbonation.  A well-known, well respected Imperial IPA who's reputation is well-deserved. The muscular malt character here does much to offset the strong hops. Many die-hard hop-heads may not appreciate this, as the result lacks the overwhelming blast of hop-bitterness that many other IPAs flaunt.

10099,2093,mobrado,3.48,Had this reasonably fresh and it still reminded me more of a Barleywine or a hoppy Strong Ale like Brown Shugga than a DIPA. Malty and sweet with moderate bitterness. Not nearly as hoppy as I had hoped.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Smells sweet and fruity; grapefruit, mango, oranges, and pineapple. Also slight notes of banana and spice. Nice mild taste. I get pine, citrus, grapefruit, orange, and kiwi. Sweet, yet tart on the back end. Dry, sticky aftertaste.  Overall, a decent IPA. It didn't prove to be what I've heard. In comparison to a lot of 9% IPA's, this beer is tame and mild. I'd call this a session beer, if anything. Again, not bad, just not what I was hopong for.

I got a lot of bread off the nose with this one along with some pine and earth tones alcohol is hidden well in this. strong bitter pine to start and mellows out with the barley flavor. Very well rounded taste from start to finish. Mild aftertaste. light to medium carbonation with this one. Felt very full yet smooth to drink. Unlike most IPAs out there (especially this one is hopped for 90 minutes). The barley really mellows out that dank and bitter hop taste. Overall Im glad I picked this one up. On a different spectrum than a lot of the IPAs out there that scream bitterness. Ive had 60 minute a few times, but this is my first 90. Will definitely get this one again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,ThaneMcC,4.41,"Pours a coppery amber with copious white foamy head that resolves to a fine lacing. Smells of hops (pine/grapefruit), very floral, rich bread like aroma Sweet forward with a nice balance from the hops and clean finish. Not syrupy, nice astringent quality synergies with hops and hardly detectable ABV.   Overall, a very enjoyable beer, in a blind taste test - I was unable to differentiate Lagunitas Brown Shugga' and this beer. Either a testament to how great these beers are, or how unrefined my palate. Regardless, I would put this on my rotation of great American IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

But there was a lone bottle in my local grocery store and I thought, why not. So, with that in mind... I started this around 56F. It poured an OMG beautiful golden amber, perhaps the prettiest beer I've seen. Nice whitish head that lasted long enough to appreciate. Smell was mostly citrus hops. Maybe some grapefruit, but definitely citrus. Aroma was the weakest link. Taste followed, but slightly out performed the aroma. Feel was medium body and quite creamy. In fact, there's many a stout that could take a lesson. I found myself wanting to really like this beer, but ultimately it is not my thing. My rating is probably unfair because I'm not into IPAs, but if you are, or want to try one, I heartily recommend this beer!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

If you were to look at it and how clear it was, you'd never guess it had this creamy, full-bodied mouthfeel. It's really exquisite  O: I can see now why it's rated so highly.

Smell: Awesome. Citris and Pine with some sweetness from the malt and resin from the hops. Smells very fresh. The head is just slowly dissapating, popping hop aroma all over the place.  Taste: Boom! Tastes following the nose here. Very big and bitter with pine and citrus. Malt is sweet and balances the power of the hops. You can taste the booze, but its terciary at best. Love it. My favorite of the 30, 60, 90, 75, and 120.  Mouthfeel: Very well done here. Just the right amount of carbonation as to not make this big beer feel heavy while drinking. DFH always does a fine job with this.  Overall: In a world plastered with DIPAs and Hopbombs, this carries DFH's flag very well, imo. Very easy to drink, and never disappointing.

10099,2093,JohnnyI,4.45,"Well, I picked up a couple of bottles to review, and before I knew it the vultures were circling. My wife seized the opportunity while I was finishing my pale ale reviews to help herself to the 90 Minute IPA's chilling in the fridge. I was able to get a 5 oz. sample out of the deal though. LOL. Even in her IPA tulip the beer demonstrated amazing clarity. You can see every detail of your hand holding the glass through the body of the beer. I really like the copper-amber appearance, with its unique cinnamon highlights. The frothy 2 finger head and ample uneven lacing add to the allure. The aroma has a nutty brown ale quality with an abundant rustic hop character. Scents of sweet breads mingle with hints of sour citrus. I'm actually surprised by the super malty flavors of this one. A bold brown sugar sweetness compliments the myriad hop complexities, and threatens to steal the show. Noticeably absent is any real sense of bitterness. Typically with a mega-hopped brew of this stature you can expect a dry, bitter bomb. Not the case at all with this one. Instead you get a lot of nice fruity flavors, earthy spice, a little mint and very reserved citrus pith. Everything comes together in a rich, hearty body. The perfect carbonation helps create a creamy texture that might just be the best I've ever had in an IPA. This may also be the only DIPA that I've had where the malts truly stack up to the hops, and the resulting balance creates an entirely new understanding of what an IPA can be. Make no mistake, at 90 IBU's this one is not lacking in the hop department in any way. It's just a bit of sleight of hand for the malts to seduce you in to thinking you may have a barleywine in your possession instead. Admittedly, the sweetness can become a little much, but no more so than the bitterness of most other Imperial IPA's. In the world of creative craft beers, this one stands out to me for its originality and pure personality.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Instead the bitterness and alcohol just kind of linger there.... interesting. There is an herbal and tea feel from the hops, though, that lead into the apricot flavors.

This beer (which is very different than the 60 minute IPA) has a glorious finish that is round and smooth. It is just so beautiful. It almost makes me want to cry.  I have developed a quick appreciation for this and other high alcohol beers. NOT for the alcohol, but because they share a characteristic that I find beautiful They are like a fine spirit that you sip slowly because it is so elegant.

M: Medium body. O: This is the Imperial IPA that sets the standard. All Imperial IPA's are better or worse. Its well dry hopped, well balanced and dry but with a slight sweetness.  This is truly a world class IPA fresh. Take note of the bottling date on the neck of the bottles as this is excessively dry hopped and much better fresh.

10099,2093,slee196,4.67,"Dogfish IPA is my go-to and I've tried all 60, 90, and 120 min IPAs. In short, I can't get enough of them. 90 min IPA has a full body with rather aggressive hoppy tone/taste. I think it's a bit strong for those who are not familiar with IPAs. So, for instance, my friend who only drinks mainstream adjunct lagers tried this beer for the first time and he said it was ""too bitter and too awfully strong"". However, I think the opposite. Despite the apparent bitterness, this beer is NOT overwhelming; it's actually very well-balanced, pleasant, and smooth. Its structure is admirably delicate. It has a great drink-ability. When you first crack it open, the amazing hoppy scent will grab your attention. And at your first sip, you will notice the malty backbone and piney undertone. Then, at your second sip, you will be surprised at how refreshing it is despite the high hop content. It ends a bit dry and sweet and leaves you with a great aftertaste.  My advice: I highly recommend this beer if you are already into IPAs. If you are trying IPAs for the first time, go with something more mellow and build up your palate before trying this one so that you can fully enjoy the experience.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,JohnRyanJosey,5,"I've been loving this beer for a while, so I guess it's time I reviewed it. It is my beer of choice during the summer, as my other favorites are just too heavy when it's hot outside. This is a phenomenal beer year-round, and is very refreshing no matter the temperature outside. I am currently enjoying this from my trusty stein. Look: Pours a gorgeous clover-honey color with a three-finger head that stays a while. The foam dissipates unevenly, rather like thick heads do when you know the beer has been made right. Smell: Hops. Lots and lots of hops. The grapefruit-citrus aroma of good hops overpowers any other smell. Taste: The taste is amazing. Hops are right up front, and they are strong. However, this beer is wonderfully balanced. It is not very bitter, as the hops would lead one to expect. There is some small bitterness, but it is the pleasant bitterness of grapefruit, not like eating a peel. There is a huge amount of English two-row barley malt that balances out the hops, making for a beer that is not only extremely hoppy, but very malty as well. It fades into a mellow aftertaste of citrus and sweet malt. Feel: It goes down exceptionally smoothly. It is velvety, a little more like water than oil in its consistency, though its flavor is anything but watery. Overall: Try this beer! This is about as hoppy a beer as I can stand, since I usually prefer darker beers that are maltier, like Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale. This beer has enough malt to keep it from being too bitter, and it has enough hops to satisfy any hophead cravings you may have. It is extremely drinkable year-round, but be careful: it is 9% alcohol because of the absurd amount of hops and the malt necessary to make it balanced. It is the only beer that I have ever tasted and immediately thought, ""That is genius."" And I still feel that way. A ridiculously good beer that any beer drinker, and, especially, any fan of IPA's, needs to try.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,DaverCS,4.85,"Bottled on 3/5/14 (a little age on it – but I have tried it fresh also)  12 ounce bottle poured into a snifter glass.  Appears dark orange with hints of amber and yellow. Excellent lacing on the glass. Smell immediately hits herbal notes and ends with a nice rounding out malt sweetness.  Taste is totally well-balanced. This is what all IPA’s should be. While I understand some love Hop-bombs, this is shows more mastery. It is a perfect balance between hop bitterness and malt sweetness. Not one flavor dominates the other. Initial taste is the hop presence. It isn’t that citrusy more herbal with only light notes of fruit near the middle of the sip. This beer is bitter, however, it is so well balanced, I wouldn’t have guessed the IBU’s were around 90! After the first round of the herbal hop bitterness, the malt backbone rushes in to balance it out. The beer finishes with nice alcohol warmness. I would recommend this beer with something rich and meaty, like osso buco or a thick pasta with a hearty ragu.  Overall, this is an awesomely crafted, well-balanced beer. For anyone new to craft beer, this is an excellent example/ starting point for a great IPA. The beer is bitter, but isn’t the typical hop-bomb that tends to alienate non-IPA drinkers. The only downside to this beer is that it is a little too thick, which may be due to the extra malt. I think a tad bit more carbonation would give it a little more of a lightening lift. I would rate this beer a 97/100!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

What I actually tasted was something especially sweet, with a fairly prominent alcohol taste. Not all that amazing. So sweet, in fact that I don't think I'll be drinking it again.

10099,2093,Rocknrao,4,"I think I got a skunky pour perhaps. I dropped into an innocent looking tavern in the mission on a Friday night, while waiting for dinner companions to arrive across the street.  It was heavy and bitter. Not the effervescent kind of bitter that you get from a really fresh keg, but rather a dull, palate numbing sort of bitter.  It was a deep amber yellow in color and it left copious lacing behind on the glass with each sip.  I didn't get any fruity or tingley after taste from it, just a different kind of bitterness.  Based on this beer's reputation, I would say I probably got stuck at the dog end of a draught gone by.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,dd43,4.12,"Perhaps like few other beers with which a lot of drinkers are familiar, dogfish 90 minute dispels the misunderstood notion that IBUs equate directly to perceived bitterness. This beer is so malty that they had to crank up the alphas as a counterbalance. A classic American double IPA. Clear, rich and dark orange in appearance, with a nice finger of head that lasts a few minutes before receding.  Aroma is caramel and malt heavy. Light pine on the nose leads to a more pronounced spruce in the flavor profile but again those malts are just so big. Some allium character will creep in. Not sticky in the mouthfeel but certainly palate coating. This is a beer that can be consumed over the course of a half hour or more with no problem. It changes as it warms. And don't let that booze sneak up on you. This is a put the kids to bed and camp out on the couch for a spell sort of drinking experience.

Follows the nose. Taste lots of piney hops followed by a deep malt backbone. Malt consists of caramel, honey; hops consist of pine and mild grapefruit. Overall, quite superb.  M: Thick and creamy.

Incredibly sweet malty, fruity and caramel aromas. I also detect floral and perfumy aromas as well as slight citric and piney hops. Lots of hops in the taste, however, the sweet malt is quite prominent, almost cloying but not in a bad way, more in a nectar of the Gods. Medium bodied and low carbonation once the drink warms; quite easy to drink. This might be high ABV, but I could drink many.

Excellent retention and huge sticky lacing.  Very fruity aroma. Bright citrus grapefruit, orange, and apricot combine with raisin and floral aromas. A bit of dank comes out as the beer warms. Toffee and an indistinguishable spiciness. Juiciness dominates.  The flavor definitely hints at late-addition hops, with only the slightest hint of bitter astringency but a ton of juicy hoppy flavors. Tropical and citrus overwhelm the palate with noticeable caramel malts in the background. Slightly resiny and a touch of dark fruit as well. Brandy-like alcohol flavors. Finish is well-balanced, and even a little sweet though far from cloying.  Medium-heavy bodied and moderately carbonated. Somewhat syrupy and slick.  Overall 90 Minute is a wonderful beer. It's pretty well-balanced but doesn't truly stand up to many of the best DIPAs that I've tried. Still, it's a classic.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,SmashPants,4.12,"Bottle: a thick dark brown embossed 355mL bottle with a decent label.  Appearance: poured into a tulip glass - a light haze with an amber-orange hue. Plenty of very fine carbonation across the profile. A decent off-white head hangs about for ages, and drops to a half-finger with fantastic lacing.  Aroma: plenty of hops, but not as sharp as usual with an American IPA. They come across a lot more fresh and floral, which is a nice change. Predominantly floral with some pine and citrus. Some light biscuit malt backing.  Taste: very much smoother than I was expecting from an AIPA. Lots of those hops again, but a smooth, fresh and floral version. Not necessarily better than the normal AIPA, just a different version of it. Rather nice, actually.  Aftertaste: some bitterness comes through from the hops, but really it is still more smooth with that biscuit malt still evident.  Mouth feel: moderate in feel with a lovely silky smoothness. Somewhat dry on the finish. Carbonation is perfect.  Overall: this is a fantastic take on the American IPA. The dry-hopping and continual hopping really allows the full, fresh flavour of the hops to come through. The price is a bit prohobitive at around AU$170+ for a case of 24 x 330mL, but that's to be expected when so many hops are used in a beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

T- Heavy malt load and resinous hop flavors are trumped by, you guessed it, sugar and alcohol. Less so than in the aroma thus allowing flavors to develop.  M- Thick, chewy and resinous.

Clear through, which seemed odd for a big hop beer. June 2014 bottling date poured Sept 2014. Too long?  Nice pine-dominant hop aroma. Poured cold, so I let it sit awhile. It need it. First sips were not as flavorful as ""maybe the best IPA in America"" should warrant. However, I do have a West Coast bias, so...

I recently saw this on sale so I thought I would give it a good overview now that I am more in tune with the style and I will have to say that after trying some other bruisers that this one was a bit disappointing. I say this because I have become somewhat of a hop addict. I felt that there was too much malt in the beer making it a bit too sweet for what I prefer. Nevertheless, I will give it a higher mark because it was the beer that got me into the style and for that reason it does deserve a higher place in the pantheon of DIPA's.

10099,2093,orcrist_cleaver,4.67,"A: Medium gold to light amber. A little opaque. Minimal head, and O.K. lacing.  S: Big tropical fruit. Pineapple,mango, and honeydew..Spicy orange citrus. Raisins, apple. Very rich malts. Caramel sweetness and the sensation of dark rye.  M: Oily, slick, medium body. Moderate carbonation, but lacking any significant 'tingling' sensation that might accompany IPAs. Makes it very easy to drink for it's ABV, and holds well to the richer flavors of this IPA.  T: Lots of resinous pine cones. Orange citrus. Lighter fruits-apricot and pineapple. But what makes this beer distinctive is its great malt backbone contributing a bready aspect to cope with the heavier flavors of raisin and fig. Slight buttery and brandy alcohol sensation on end, nut sweetened by presence of aforementioned fruits. The heaviness of the malts is definitely reminiscent of Bengal Lancer or an IIPA, but the citrus, piney, dank hops give it an appropriate hop presence found in most DIPAs.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S: bright resinous pine and sticky citrus orange fruit. leafy hop notes and just a dense nose. floral and everything you want out of a serious IPA.  T: grainy hops but still the density of it all is mind boggling. Presence of alcohol is highly noticeable. The serious take on dry-hopping goes a long way here for the fact it masks the high ABV. Beautifully well rounded but a tad hot. Not for the meek  M: medium bodied with sticky oil coating the mouth leaving a long lasting residue with grainy hop not and light malt.  O: Duuude, this beer will put hear on your nose, not in your nose, but on it. Definitely something I've never experienced. I've had 60 minute and 120 minute but the 90 is quite surprising for the boldness yet complemented by elegance. Very deceiving and seductive.

10099,2093,brureview,4.47,"7/14 I wanted to update my review because this is the first time I've tasted the beer in a Spiegalgau IPA glass-perfect for this beer and any IPA.  I noticed this time a much stronger pine aroma/taste and an excellent balance of hops, tropical fruit, pine, and bitterness.  I have to buy more of this beer. It's one of the few IPAs I can drink on a regular basis.  3/12  The smell of hops whisks off the head of this IPA. There is a hoppy puckiness to the mouthfeel. A great quality of this beer is its finish- highlighting a smooth melding of hops and grass, There is the presence here of a perfectly balanced hops aftertaste- the ultimate IPA experience.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Appearance: Pours a clear golden amber with 1 finger of head  Smell: Earthy hops and fruity esters  Taste: Hop flavor with underlying sweet, malty syrup notes with slightly boozy finish  Mouthfeel: Feels thicker than average for the style  Overall: While this is a great beer, its not my personal flavor preference for a double IPA. There is a significant amount of malt used which throws off the balance with some booziness and warmth. I still enjoy this from time to time but I personally want an unbalanced double IPA in the opposite direction.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,ThePaintedGrey,4.12,"12oz. bottle poured into tulip. *Re-reviewed*  Original review written on 3-02-2014: 4.61.  A: Looks to be a deep red amber hue, until held to the light and a bright, yet hazy, goldenrod color appears. A gorgeous off-white cascading effect results in a gloriously large and creamy head, about two fingers and then some in stature. Retention is acceptable and a decent sized creamy cap remains throughout much of the beer. Significant amounts of lacing can be found all down the glass. Head retention seems a bit weaker than I recall from my last review.  S: Strong grapefruit juice aromas with a tender dash of pine resin. Perhaps a touch of plums? Something in the dark fruits realm going on in the middle of that grapefruit. Strong caramel malts fight for dominance over the juiciness. Nothing in this smell, however, points to this being a hop-heavy DIPA.  T: An EXTREME mesh of hops and malts, with both of them truly duking it out for the lead role. Malts add a ton of sweetness: think honey-drizzled oats, hints of caramel, sweetbreads. The hop medley is interesting. Instead of going for a pungent profile as many DIPAs do, Dogfish Head opts for a really interesting combination of spice and citrus that definitely offers a respectable touch of bitterness, but never truly overpowers the malts... it adds more of a complimenting accentual flavor note.  M: Full-bodied, borderline huge. Thick and malty and as smooth as glass. Lightly creamy texture, good carbonation. Lots of warming properties from the alcohol. The brewers down at Dogfish Head are truly artists when it comes to perfecting the feel of their beers. This is in my top 5 beers in terms of sheer textual perfection.  O: I used to hold DFH's 90-minute in the highest regards, praising it as one of the best DIPAs on the market. While I still feel it's a remarkable beer, it just doesn't push the same buttons as it used to for me. This beer struggles for balance, with the malts often taking the upper hand. While that's not an issue for everyone, it's certainly not what a bitter-freak like me looks for. With that being said, this is an excellent beer that I'll continue to drink in the future, but it'll be reserved for my maltier moods.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Decent retention and light spotty lacing. Body is relatively clear with medium amounts of visible carbonation.  Smell: Grapefruit like citrus, sweet caramel and toffee, pine, slight earthiness, touch of booziness.  Taste: Big malt sweetness balanced by hop bitterness in the finish. Flavors are more citrus and pine with lots of sweet and toasted bready malt character as well.  Mouthfeel: Medium/full bodied with a slightly sticky mouthfeel. Carbonation is medium.

Taste: Awesome! There's a little bit of sweetness to it. Tastes incredibly balanced between the malt and hops. Citrus, specifically orange.

10099,2093,Atkinson,4.16,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Bottled on 5/30/14. Tasted on 7/28/14  Appearance: Half-inch soapy head, nearly pure-white. The color is a transparent, golden-copper. Lacing initially holds a very nice level of retention, but fades fairly quickly. Still have some lace lingering towards the top of the glass after a long drink-down, though.  Smell: Sweet hop aroma followed by some caramel maltiness and hints of alcohol.  Taste: Hops hit you from the onset and stay with you until the end. It's a puckering bitterness. Alcohol warms your throat and nose towards the end. After taste is much more fruity than I would have expected.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth but thick with moderate to low carbonation. Dries the mouth.  Overall: A very solid Imperial IPA that I would recommend to any hop-head. Not particularly my favorite flavor profile for an Imperial IPA, however, I can still appreciated the quality. Would like to try on-tap, would buy a four-pack if I could share some with friends or family. I would give it 90-93 overall.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Taste: Potent bitter bite hits you right away, but is quickly displaced by a smooth and sweet wave of thick caramel. A bit of alcohol on the tail end reminds you that this one packs a punch and warms you simultaneously.  Mouthfeel: A medium to heavy bodied IPA with moderate carbonation.

Unfiltered honey-golden color, two-finger head with persistent lacing. Aroma is light roasted malt, and fragrant floral hops. Flavor, as you probably all know so well, is out-of-this-world amazing, malt, sweetness, a bit of apricots, a bunch of pine, and delightful hops, well-balanced, and not at all mild. Mouthfeel is medium, not quite chewy. Overall this is the most amazuing flabbergasting tasty IPA I have ever sampled. But what do I know?

Not much citrus, but it's there.  Taste - Very malty and bitter, and an unfortunate amount of alcohol cuts through the taste. I caught slight notes of citrus and pine, but the malt overwhelms most other flavors. I'm surprised at how much alcohol I could taste, especially as I kept drinking. This is not what I would consider a well-balanced DIPA. If you're looking for fruit you'll be disappointed.  Mouth - Thick, syrupy and yet creamy. The carbonation is right, but it sticks to your mouth longer than I prefer.  Overall - This is the first 90 minute I've had in a long time, and in my opinion it does not compare favorably to the newer DIPAs on the market - especially if you prefer juicy, fruity, and fresh tasting IPAs like I do.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Such as this beer: I got a variety-pack of beer from the local market and gave this highly-rated beer a try. I am not totally disappointed.  I poured this bottle into a pint glass, got a 1"" head that lasted longer than most, and a not-too-strong piney smell. What I think saves this beer for me is the ""ridiculous amount of English Two-Row Barley"" that Dogfish Head uses after the 90-minute hopping. The taste is strong with both hops and malt at the front, the finish is pretty dry, but for me, a little too sour.

S: Hits you square in the face with big oily pine hops, but covers its tracks with citrus and active malts notes. I can sometimes pick up traces of alcohol, but it tends to vary depending on the age of the beer.  T: Delicious, and unlike many other DIPAs. Big, chewy, bitter hops... feels raw, but is complemented by toasted, bready malts after the initial tasting. Finishes sweet and dry with warming feel of alcohol. This one keeps the taste buds working hard with each sip.

There is also a hint of alcohol hiding in the background.  Taste: Wow, a big hit of pine and spice, then some booziness. I also get booze in the aftertaste as well as some pine and onion and pepper.

10099,2093,captaincoffee,4.14,"I continue to love what Dogfish Head has done for the brewing industry...particularly their willingness to go beyond what is traditionally ""sellable"" and just try to make interesting beers. They are like the ultimate homebrewer with a big budget to try whatever hits their fancy. I also loved this beer when it first came out. Big and bold; sold in stores when the only beer you could get like this was at the brewery of some of the good microbrews. Pours amber with tight bubbled head that doesn't rise very high. (I'll skip the nose for now). Taste is bitter up front and is very well balanced by full malt backbone. Great mouthfeel and balance in this brew. It also finishes very well with lingering hops on the center of the tongue. I would have rated this beer much higher had I gotten around to writing a review years ago when I first tasted it. The problem with DFH90 is that other breweries caught up over the past few years and are not available in specialty/beer stored (Lagunitas comes to mind...I'm on the East coast). This beer simply doesn't carry the hop nose I personally feel is required to be in the top tier of imperial IPAs now available. Don't get me wrong...I like this beer very much. I just bought it today because I was on a business trip and this was available at the local Safeway supermarket.

Color - Poured a cloudy brownish orange with an off white head, particulate similar to very artisan beers  Smell - Not nearly enough hop aroma, malty  Taste - Bitter and malty with a hint of vomit. It seems they need to up the aromatic hops and lower the bittering hops, and lower the amount of malt. Plus switch yeast to something with less vomit aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - good, smooth  I do love ipa's and maybe I am biased towards the west coast style. This isn't a bad beer, it is just not that good of an IPA these days.

This beer is similar to Burton Baton which is by far my favorite beer that Sam has to offer.  Pour is great, keeps a nice frothy head for at least a minute. -left a great skirt behind the whole way down the glass. - Great dark color, not sure where at SRM but it isn't too dark, dark copper.  Smell is strong and bitter - The exact smell you hope to expect, you can almost smell the carbonation.  Taste - Great taste. Of coarse the hops ring through at first but as it goes down it leaves an alcohol warmness that is not overwhelming but would make for a good beer at the beach or on a chilly day, very versatile beer.  Mouthfeel - Full mouth feel and the carbonation doesn't over-present itself but it is present.  Overall -Great beer, much better than 60min, 75min, and almost on the same level as Sam's 120 minute.

Aromas of honey, pine, flowers and citrus. 90 minute is a malt first DIPA in the vein of hopslam but there are lovely subtle flavors that make this beer an exception to my ""I prefer dry IPAs"" mentality. Sweet malts and honey lead the flavor profile. The hopping provides floral, piney and orange citrus aromas and is not overly bitter. There is apparent alcohol in the finish but it is not unpleasant. I would prefer a more prominent hop flavor overall but the flavors are very well integrated. The carbonation is active and beer is a bit viscous, providing a creamy mouthfeel.

10099,2093,DeanWormer,4.49,"There are over 3,000 reviews below, and most of them analyze the components of this ale. Those are incredibly helpful and valuable, but there are already so many of them. So what I'll offer instead is not so much an analysis as a strategy.  I love big DIPAs - I'm passionate about them. My favorite is Great Divide Hercules - I've given it straight 5s on this site. But at $14 / four-pack at my store, that's $3.50 a bottle. I like to have one each evening, but that'd be over $1,200 a year. I'll have a Hercules when it's time to celebrate - like at 5:30 pm on the day before vacation begins - but I want a more cost-efficient day-to-day go to.  For me, that's Uinta's Hop Nosh (formerly ""Hop Notch"") - $9 a six-pack or $1.50 a can. Not technically a DIPA, but a very good alternative for a lower ABV and a much lower price.  But how about when it's time to celebrate and kick back - just not at the rate of 2 1/3 times the price of my daily brew? Aha - that calls for 90-Minute.  This is a great, great DIPA. Flavorful, balanced, hoppy yet malty, it's near the forefront of American Double IPAs. And at $10 a four pack - $2.50 a bottle - it's a perfect compromise between my regular and special-occasion ales. Esquire once said it was perhaps, the best beer brewed in America. Not quite IMO, but it's very, very close.  BTW, what's up with Dogfish Head? They can brew some of the most sublime ales on the planet. There's 90-Minute, Burton Baton is a work of art, if your palate isn't adjusted to the happiness of a DIPA, then 60-Minute is an excellent IPA - but then they dump fruit and spices in their brews, run them through their goofy ""enamel animal"" so that you can screw up their brewmaster's creation with whatever abomination you wish - it's as if Ferrari took a set of keys to the paint job of every other car that rolled off its line. But 90 Minutes is the real deal. And if you're a devotee of Imperial / Double IPAs, it's one of the great values among broadly available craft ales.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,MXGringo,4.75,"Probably my favorite beer/ale of all-time. That's a bold statement, and I rarely like to make statements that strong, BUT this is just a superior IPA. It has everything: color, smell, mouthfeel, taste, and a high ABV to boot. It's so smooth and delicious that you won't even notice the 9% abv. But, be careful...it is there!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,JCarey,4.6,"Let me start off by saying that I am not a huge fan of Dogfish even though I grew up minutes from the brewery and Sam is a family friend. After a 5 year hiatus from DFH beers after a bad night on Raison D'etre, I tried a My Antonia at Stingray's in Rehoboth and decided to reintroduce my palate to DFH. I didn't get a chance to sample 90 at the brewery(120 was available, so duh), so I picked up a 4-pack.  Poured in to a Snifter from the bottle as recommended. Thick, white, foamy head, leaves legs and a cap throughout the glass. Perfectly clear golden amber with some medium size carbonation bubbles rising from the center. No haze. Perfect.  Aroma is a super subdued IIPA. Fruity, along the lines of a big fruity white wine, resiny/dried herb hop character with a big, sweet, bready/toast malt backbone with a bit of booze. Got dock it some points for not being super aromatic, but nearly perfect.  Smooth bitterness, sweet caramel, warming alcohol. Nice and sticky mouthfeel from the hops, with a bit of spiciness. Medium-full bodied from the malt with a nice sweetness and malt character in the middle, and the alcohol coming in at the end to dry up and balance everything out.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,JulioH,3.84,"This is a good IPA, yet it doesn't follow the trend of most breweries.  Pours a nice yellow beer. Little carbonation formed. Smell doesn't have strong hops, only a faint amount. Taste is more like a regular ale. There is no bitterness to this beer. There is no cloudiness to this beer either. I guess since this beer is bottle conditioned, they decided to call it an IPA. Other than that, this is just another ale.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Kuaff,4.06,"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler at Brouwer's Café in Seattle.  It presents an inviting bright honey-like shade of orange with a frothy, white, one finger head.  I get some citrus and malty breadiness in the aroma, but not a lot else in strength.  The flavor is indeed hoppy, with some citrus backed up by a malty finish, but it doesn't pack a huge punch. I find it quite noticeably boozy, as well.  The feel is kind of between medium and full.  It doesn't hit me with hops as effectively as other DIPAs I've had, but it's still good.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,LoveThyBier,4.72,"I'm a dark beer lover. IPAs are traditionally amber to light in color. As most IPAs are of various levels of bitterness from the hops used, when I discovered Imperial IPAs, a new fondness for the style was born. This is smooth and not overpowering, but still has the right amount of bitterness that lets you know it's an IPA. Great beer all around that may be better on hot days. I alternate this with Old Rasputin from North Coast Brewery for longer drinking sessions.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,CharlesBarkley,5,"Poured into the Golden Chalice handed down from my German ancestor Hans.  Apperance: Hazy sweet pixie dust and fairy butterflies tinkling and dancing through the dark almost syrupy albeit languid fields.  Smell: Pungent, yet tender. These dark waters strangle the nostrils and do not hold back its forceful grasp without kicking and screaming. Every second of this free-wheeling head trip of a scent manages to conjure visions some would call a ""carnal desire"".  Taste: Freshly mowed grass at dusk on July. The maltiness is present, yet the hoppy nature of this beast tickles an arrangement of compacted symphonies for the expanding palate.  Mouthfeel: Its aural tentacles spread out and engulf the mouth in waves of dark melodic spirals and dissonant fuzz, washing over the palate ebbing and flowing like night tides.  Overall: A true work of art.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,WhiteHillsStore,4.27,"I can't imagine what I say hasn't been said before, but really a terrific IPA that is usually (depending on the state) easy to get. The color is a hazy yellow with a lot of citrus hops in the nose. The taste is fantastic with great hop flavors in the beginning with sweeter flavors coming through after that. This beer is thick and has a little bit of a molasses aftertaste that lingers and enhances the flavor of the hops. Would definitely recommend.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,LooseGasCap,4.41,"Wow. This is the second bottle of this brew I have ever had and it is outstanding. I enjoy hoppy brews best and this one does not dissapoint. The unique thing about this beer is that it is 9% ABV and drinks very smooth. I am enjoying this one slowly and with nachos, of all things!

Head average (4 cm), off white, creamy, slowly diminishing to 2 mm layer. Lacing excellent, covering most of the inside of the glass. Body medium orange, clear. Flavor of flowery hops with no alcohol, no diacetyl; no chalky aftertaste although the alcohol becomes more noticeable as the beer warms. Palate medium, slightly oily, lively carbonation.  A beer whose appearance says “Drink me!” and doesn’t disappoint. This beer is about the hops and they shine through.

High carbonation and retention.  Smell- Caramel and toasted bread with grapefruit citrus aroma mixed in.  Taste- Has a sweet and quite pronounced caramel malt prescence that takes up much of the flavor profile. Maybe just a tad bit of roasted quality but caramel stands out. The citrus element resides in the taste as well with notes of orange, perhaps pineapple in there too. This adds to the sweet complexity. There is the hoppy dry finish on the back end that lingers. Complex.  Mouthfeel- Moderate in body with a thick creamy feel. Alcohol can be detected. Ample amount of carbonation.  Overall- Like many Dogfish brews, 90 minute has a lot of flavors going on. Definitely on the sweet side but I enjoy that. An interesting and tasty DIPA. Maybe one of a kind style-wise. Interesting, an absolute must try.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Hides the alcohol. More like a hoppy Amber ale than an IPA. Earthy, piney, resin, balanced but not like a West Coast IPA at all. I need more hops, citrus, and grapefruit.

10099,2093,Jim_Benz,3.7,"I brought a four-pack home from Denver and was really looking forward to this beer. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd expected. But, for me, that's oftentimes the case with a DIPA--when they crank up the caramelly malt, it sends my diacetyl sensers into overdrive, and the beer ends up tasting green. But that's just me; I don't care for strong caramel flavors in beer. Anyway, here's my overall impression:  A: Beautiful, clear orange/amber coloring with a nice white head that leaves a ring and patchy covering all the way to the last sip. Very inviting.  S: Sweet and grassy. Minimal citrus, lots of malt.  T: If I ignore the powerful caramel malt flavors, I still find myself wishing for a little more kick from the hops. What I pick up instead is a little grassiness (which I like) but not much spice or citrus, let alone serious bitterness (which I doubly like). It's not a hop bomb, by any means, more of a hop-enhanced malt bomb that focuses on flavors I don't care for. However, in judging this beer, I know the malt flavors are spot on for what many people like--think Deschutes Immersion IPA (not a double, but certainly a malt forward IPA) and you'll know what I mean. In the end, it's just too sweet and caramelly for my taste. That shouldn't necessarily be the defining characteristic when I rate this beer--it's just my particular taste--but still ...  M: Perfect carbonation (it helps cut the caramel) but a little sticky and sweet, which is also the predominant aftertaste, along with a little grass from the hops. Medium bodied, I guess, mostly due to the sweet caramel. Nothing special.  O: Not my cup of tea, but probably pretty good for the style, or so I hear. I'll try another in a few days and see what I think then. In the meantime, maybe I'll go buy a six-pack of Two-Hearted Ale.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,shacawgo24,4.94,"A-Copper/dark amber with glossy orange edges. Brighter body in light, glossier edging. Off-white two finger head is creamy and bubbly. When head flattens it becomes a sizzling silver starry bubbly top layer. Head is impenetrable, you won't see the body from top view, even to the last drop. Your last sip will be slow sliding foam. A bit dull and dirty-murky when not held in light the body is. But it does scrub up like a new penny in light.  S-Oranges and lemons. Hoppy. Fresh. Brown bread. Bran. Caramel malts. Toffee hiding in there. Booze a la dark bourbon. Sniffing some more, grains are inhaled. Honey. Burnt sugar. Soy sauce and sweet whiskey on warming. Any beer that can make me smell those many things, (while smell may not put me in a dream state) it makes me think, decipher and appreciate.  T-Caramel malt & orange/lemon citrus upfront. Then those classic 90 minute hops come in. Dark bready, sweet, piney and citrusy all in one. Pineapple too. With the sip all these flavors are in harmony, one taste seems to dominate then another jet blasts in allowing you to choose and focus on a set flavor. So much going on but controlled and contained. On warming a salty-sweet flavor kicks in like a dark ginger/plum sauce and/or 120 Minute IPA super cheesy-sour/sweet notes.  M-Perfect mediums of body and carbonation. Starts sweet & alkaline sour like a grapefruit, airs of pine in the middle blows into a drying yet oily hop finish. Pine in the after with hints of resin leave the tongue comfortably numb. But if improvement can be made to this beer it's in the feel. It should be thicker on the onset. It waters down on a maybe average/probably below average rate. This Double IPA should have better body retention. And carbonation a tad higher and longer lasting as well. Even more sizzle, more HOPS! 90 Minute feels like a regular IPA, like 60 Minute almost. It should have a Herculean body that stands up even on it's last legs. What should be a DIPA is really an Extra IPA.  O-90 Minute was the first craft beer I had that made me think and say, ""this is the best beer I have ever had"". A great springboard to discover even better craft out in the world. You will return to 90 Minute always even if you master your palate. It's bold, flavorful and versatile in all departments of palate. It can benefit from tweaking, mainly in feel. But the smell and taste are perfect. If 90 Minute had the robust, thick, sizzling feel of say Dogfish Head-Palo Santo Marron, it would be unbeatable. 90 Minute looks and tastes dark.

It hits the taste buds with that strong imperial IPA taste and the 9.0% alcohol (ABV) gives it that hard edge and wakes you up (or puts you to sleep if you drink too many). It pours darkish, with a reddish amber tint, finger sized tan head, and some carbonation. The main taste is bitter, with hoppy, caramel, fruity, and sweet.

It hits the palate in the right ways.  O: This is a great tasting IPA that is very easy to find here on the east coast. I would say that at $9.99 for a four pack, it is very well priced.

My first try at the style, but I've been jumping on the hop wagon more and more so I thought I'd really take a dive.  Pours a clear amber with a one finger foamy white head. Smells delicious, hops and lots of them. Not intense at all however.  Decided to let this one warm up a bit to bring more of the flavors. And boy is there flavor. Strong hop aroma enters my nose as I drink. Look, it's an imperial IPA. It's hoppy. It's intense. But it's so well balanced and surprisingly smooth. Mouthfeel is creamy and pretty full.  Boy, I like this beer. Leaving me wanting more, but at 9% I'd better tread lightly.

Collar has large bubbles and very small bubbles that hold together for a medium thickness. Wisps hold throughout. Aroma is resiny and toasty malt, a touch of citrus as well. Taste is that big malt backbone with the hops playing a much smaller role than I remember. I definitely haven't had this beer in a few years, and my palate has changed considerably. I get some of the resin and citrus in the palate, but it's mostly a caramel malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is sticky sugar-like, medium body, medium-high carbonation.

Smells of sweet fresh hops, citrus, pine, and possibly caramel. Tastes of sweet malts, slight caramel, a hint of bitter hops; but yet completely smooth and indulgent. Light, creamy, and full bodied mouthfeel. Extremely well-balanced, complex, DIPA that cannot be ignored. Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA is my recommended all-time favorite Imperial IPA.

The aroma is of spiced hops and herbs, pine, wet earth/dirt, and distant citrus (orange and lemon zest mostly). It tastes of spicy, earthen hops, rich wood, wet earth, pine, and citrus. The mouthfeel is rich and full, but not heavy. Finish is crisp and refreshing with only a slight resinous sensation.

Strong hop, with some peppery spice, pine and citrus, stone fruit (again peach), against a malt sweetness that closes out with a subtle, in no way overpowering, bitterness.  M - Some mild drying. There is no sign of the ABV here. It is not a quick drinker, but it is easy going down.  O - Each time I drink this, I am more impressed. There are few DIPA that compete for balance and drinkability.

I assumed this would be a bolder, hoppier version, and boy was I wrong. It was by far the sweetest IPA/DIPA I've ever had, and that's not a bad thing, I'm just not sure if it's normally supposed to taste like this. Huge malt backbone, lots of tropical notes, with very little hop bitterness. If you put this in front of me and told me it was a pale/amber ale I completely would have believed it. Definitely did not seem like a DIPA. Alcohol was imperceptible. I don't remember thinking it was cloyingly sweet, but I'd imagine others might think so. My girlfriend even liked it, and she hates hoppy beers.  Very interesting DIPA. I'm not sure if this is what it's supposed to taste like, but I'm looking forward to trying it again.

It reminds me of walking through a forrest right after the rain and smelling something extremely earth and delicious.  T- For those of you who have had a 90', you understand. Simply delicious and super hoppy.  F- The first sip of a fresh, properly chilled 90' will sting the tongue mildly from the carbonation, but this is not a bad thing by any stretch.

The overall smell is actually rather on the mild side, but offers a promising, rather hoppy smell.  The taste is pretty solid. It's fairly inoffensive in flavorings and not as strong tasting as some double IPAs. They did a very good job of balancing out the hops and malts in this beer, and likewise, it goes down very smoothly. I haven't yet tried it with food, but it seems like it would compliment my cooking (a lot of spicy and Mexican style foods) nicely as well.

The bottle boasts its creative style although the bottle doesn't really express ""Imperial IPA comin' at ya"" but overly refined with off reds and pinks surrounding the standard Dogfish logo.  Pours as a standard IPA color, 3 finger head quickly desinigrates to a frosty sugarcoating on the top.  The smell is sweet, dried apricots, melon and a subtle note of butterscotch.  The taste starts with a sweeping hit of alcohol that kicks back to a citrus-less sweetness. I've never had a sugarplum, but this would be my idea of what a wintery sugarplum powdered in large sugar granules would taste like.  Finishes WAY thick and chewy hit you pretty good too as the 9% alcohol washes down your throat. Solid beer, but nothing special from Dogfish. A company that prides itself on experimenting with flavors to make unique beers made one of their more standard and uninteresting grogs with this one.

10099,2093,falloutsnow,2.78,"From: Binny's, Champaign, IL Date: Bottled 2014-01-07 Glass: Tulip  A bit disappointing. After not drinking 90-minute for many years, when DFH removed itself from non-Chicago markets, I was happy that the brewery once again began distributing here. The beer I taste, though, is something of a lackluster reunion, with obvious ethanol and more malt influences than hops. The result is something like a barleywine with unintriguing malt selection and brewing procedures. Not a beer I'll pick up again.  Pours a 2.5cm tall head of off-white colored foam, small in size yielding a frothy appearance, with slightly above average retention of 1.5 minutes, the foam fading to a thick ring around the perimeter of the glass. Lacing is excellent, a complex wash of intricate patterns cling to all the walls of the glass. Body is a dark golden orange color, bordering on mineral brown, with light bringing out brighter golden-orange hues. Carbonation visible through the transparent body,  Aroma is not that impressive, with a rather vague and one-dimensional caramel-like sweetness being the most apparent; herbal and woodsy, with a bit of tropical fruit, hop notes along with some peppery ethanol well in the background.  Overall flavor is of rich malt sweetness with notable caramel-like sweetness joined to a strong hop bitterness and ethanol presence, with modest woodsy and herbal hop flavors. Front of palate tastes light caramel-like sweetness; ethanol; floral, woodsy, and herbal hop flavors. Mid-palate of rich malt sweetness, pale and caramel-like, with medium to medium-high hop bitterness and floral, woodsy, and herbal hop flavors, as well as some moderately apparent ethanol (increasing in obviousness with warmth). Back of palate tastes ethanol, moderate hop bitterness, and a background of caramel-like sweetness from selected malts. Aftertaste is of ethanol, herbal hops, moderate to strong hop bitterness, and a light background of bread-like malt sweetness.  Beer is medium-heavy in body, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a smooth (5/6) and lowly foamy (1/6) beer. Ethanol readily apparent as burning on the tongue and back of throat, mild heat in nostrils.

Would have liked a larger head to get some more aroma. *much larger heads in subsequent drinkings, have adjusted  Taste - Malt hits you in the face with the bitterness from the hops to follow up, the bitterness lingers, but it is not overwhelming.

Then you get a warming smell of pungent alcohol and a sweetness that resembles pineapple that develops throughout the entire smell of the beer.  Taste - Citrus that is slightly sweet and rich gives a feel of honey and caramel. Malts definitely add a graininess to the flavor that hits the palate after the initial citrus. Finishes with alcohol and roasted flavors.  Mouthfeel - Full body. Carbonation is just right, not to intense and refreshing.  Overall - This is not the first time I've had this beer for a reason.

10099,2093,Emnmarko,4.78,"A- Semi clear, roasted amber color. Decent creamy head with some hang time. Plenty of carbonation. Scant lacing but eh, who cares?  S- Fresh citrusy hop aroma, over malty nuance's. Fruit, maybe banana.?  T- Wow, first impression is amazing! There is a lot going here. I'm inundated with a roasted malt blast that is quickly followed with an appropriate amount of hop bitterness. A little alcohol heat right on the heels of the flavor wave. A perfect balance throughout .  M- Nicely carbonated. Takes to the trip to the ole stomach without so much as a fit!  O- Now this is one fine beer! I highly recommend it. Dogfish Head found a perfect balance with this IPA. A nice kick at 9 percent without the overbearing alcohol kick despite the taste. Its been a while since I've had a 90 Minute, but I'm not going to let it be too long before I get another.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,TheBrouMaster,4.65,"A - Pretty dark for an IPA: amber, with a reddish hue. Solid two finger head with very good retention (1/2 finger head even to the end of the glass). Beautiful lacing all up and down the glass. Translucent.  S - Very mild for a DIPA. Citrus and hops, but no strong grapefruit or orange peel like I'm so used to in an IPA.  T - Super smooth and malty; wow! Yeah, it's a hop bomb, but the balance is maybe the best I've ever had in an IPA. Huge, huge malt profile, but nothing undesirable at all. Creamy. Citrus and pulp. Absolutely amazing.  M - I repeat: smooth and creamy. A bit of alcohol and carbonation sting, but very drinkable. Cloying as the beer warms slightly.  O - This beer surprised me. I've had the 60 minute, and I kind of expected a hoppier version. While technically true, the amazing balance with the huge malt load absolutely shocked me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

This beer is very fresh tasting, kind of piney, but it actually goes down very smoothly. It absolutely has my respect even if it is not my favorite beer. This is one IPA I actually think I may enjoy better out of a bottle than on tap to cool it's upfront bitter taste, though give it a chance because it is definitely a quality drink (if you can't tell already based on the fact that its from DFH Brewery)",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Taste: I got complex hoppy fruitiness, with flavors that included tangerine and pinneapple. Corriander and other spicey notes, with some piney earthiness.  Mouthfeel: medium body, bit of welcome dryness, heavy carbonation but not overpoweringly so.  Overall: a flawless, rich, delicous IPA that really distinguishes itself.

10099,2093,NeedBeerHere,4.17,"Pours out a dark amber in color with a nice white, one-finger head with good retention and nice lacing. Smell is of some nice sweet caramel malt, with a nice floral bouquet from the hops. I get pineapple, guava, orange, and basically more tropical fruits from the hops. The nose seems to be very well balanced for the style. Taste is really almost exactly like the nose except the malts and hops are more forward but still just as balanced. There is a slight bit of bitterness in the taste that stays in the mouth and doesn't hit the throat much. The mouthfeel is sort of thinner than I expected but it seems to fit the style. Overall this is a REALLY well balanced beer for the style. I thought it would be a hop-bomb but it is nothing like that. Just a really well put together beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,wvsabbath,4.34,"Serving Type - Bottle  Appearance - Tanish golden brown with some red tint. White head that disappered very fast  Smell - Hops, pineapple, oranges, grapes, alcohol, caramel malts, spices, some sweet sugars.  Taste - Has a nice mix of sweet floral hops, caramel malts and added wet hops. Hops are citric, orange, pineapple with some lemon and added spices. Malts are caramel flavored, along with a smoked/burnt flavor. Alcohol is noticeable in smell and in the flavor. Sugars add sweetness and works well with the hops and malts.  Mouthfeel - Sweet hops coats the tongue at first sip. Malts come in and coats the palate with the caramel and burnt flavors. Alcohol is present on tongue and palate from start to finish. Aftertaste is warm, sweet and malty.  Overall - A really tasty beer. Unique flavor profile for sure. Has great balance being a strong dipa. Malts are just as present as the hops yet are not overpowering. This is not a bitter beer at all and still easy to drink at 9%. Worth a drink for sure.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I gave a friend some and he said ""it tastes like the pellets you add when brewing).  The beer is just wonderful. It is a handful of taste as far as hops concerns.

10099,2093,MattyG85,4.31,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Surly Darkness chalice. Bottled on 11/27/13.  Appearance: Pours a bright and fairly clear copper amber orange with a moderate amount of bubbles. About two fingers of white head that slowly settle into a thin creamy layer. Leaves a lot of creamy lacing around the glass.  Smell: A big and fairly ripe hoppy aroma that is very balanced by the bready malts. Upfront scent of earthy and floral hops with lots of hints of wet grass and some pine. Citrus presence is subtle with some hints of orange peel, lemon, pineapple, and slight grapefruit. Big malt balance with hints of biscuit, grains, sweet caramel, toffee, and cracker. Also some subtle hints of candied sugar and dark fruit. A very earthy and pretty nice aroma.  Taste: Like the aroma, although a little more stronger with the oily hop presence. Big taste of hops upfront with earthy and floral notes of wet grass and pine resin. Citrus hop notes of orange peel, pineapple, grapefruit, and lemon zest. Hops have a nice biting but not overwhelming bitterness. Big malt presence with bready notes of biscuit, grains, caramel, toffee, yeast, and cracker. Slight undertones of dark fruit and candy sugar. A very solid taste.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Very chewy and earthy with a drying finish. Alcohol heat is subtle.  Overall: A really solid take on a Imperial IPA. Much different than the typical West Coast style. The hops are backed by a big malt presence. Balanced but still bold.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,NickSMpls,4.37,"A very classy and well-regarded DIPA -- with good reason. Dark honey look with thick and slowly fading head. Pine, fresh mango and fruit aroma comes out and advertises what's in store. A rich, solid blast of pine notes from the hops. The malts play a best supporting actor role to the academy-award winning hop profile. The DIPA of 9% ABV is noticeable, but not hot. Compared to a west coast hop bomb, this one is much more approachable, but hardly a beginner's beer. Savor it year round.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

T - Citrus and Pine are what I take out of this IPA, but there are indeed others.  M - Medium body that pair well with the carbonation. Smooth and sweet.  O - This is a solid choice IPA.

Thick webs of lacing coat my glass. Not sure that a IIPA could look more perfect.  S - Sweet and malty like an amber, but it wakes up and has a big hoppy aroma. Sweet tropical, floral, and earthy hops.  T - Malts are up front and are sweet amber and honey. Pineapple and orange are the big hop players, but there are other floral and dank earthy hops blended, Finish is bitter and piney.  M - Medium bodied and superb carbonation. Smooth, sticky and sweet.  O - This is a very nice IIPA that DFH has brewed. I really like how it is big and sweet like an amber and moves into a big hoppy profile.

Looks delicious. Typical IPA floral, piney nose. Very tasty but towards the end the hops are bitterly unleashed and slightly detract from overall balance. Mouth feel lingers on the tongue, slightly chewy. Very tasty IIPA, just short of world class.

Almost perfume like. Definitely one of the more malty smelling DIPAs I’ve smelled. Not very citrusy.  The first flavor is a grapefruit bite. Then there’s pineyness and a bit of grass. Quite floral. Very sweet.  Then the beer is quite malty and the crystal malt in there reminds me a lot of Nugget Nectar. However, instead of just the sweet crystal malt linger, there’s a slight bitterness that cleans the beer up. The huge amount of crystal malt. A good amount of booze on the back end.

M: Full syrupy mouthfeel with slight hop zing on the back end. Sweet coating on the teeth and gums well after my final sip.  O: The beer was bottled exactly three months ago from the date I reviewed it.I found this to be both an amazing beer as well as an amazing example of the style.

10099,2093,BastardKing24,4.6,"This beer is just great, I should have reviewed sooner.  Pours bright and clear amber with a huge head that stuck around for a few minutes. I wouldn't be surprised if the bubbles lasted 90 minutes lol. Probably finish it before then. 30 minutes in and they're still there.  Smell is right away floral hops, fruity and complex, with orange, lemon, pineapple, kiwi, peach, pear. Not getting much pine smell in this, it's all fruit.  Taste is yummy, to say the least. Tons of complex fruit and hops, tasty malts, fresh multigrain bread. If you use your imagination you can sort of pick out any light colored fruit flavor, its that rich, but not overpowering. 9% leaves you wanting more and also doesn't have a alc. burn. It has a little bit of citrus but I'd say its more on the peachy and mango side of fruity.  Mouthfeel is rich and robust with medium carbonation and a sticky hoppy resin feel.

Malt comes strong in the nose to leading to an excellent balance. 5.00  Taste - Hop. Beautiful balance between alpha acids and the mellowing effect of the malt. Spice notes linger in the back with small amounts of cardamon. Long finish that lingers with malt primarily.

10099,2093,Redneckwine,4.43,"Pint glass on tap. It should be noted the pub was a little smelly with fried foods and god knows what else, which may have affected the nose adversely.  Appearance - Light amber, 1.5 finger head recedes to whispy cap, streaky lacing.  Smell - Big citrusy nose, caramely...at this point the stinky pub smell is interfering with more feint qualities.  Taste/MF - Mellow carbonation with medium/heavy body, very smooth. Tasting tangerines, grapefruit, apple, slight white wine, orange, light caremel malt presence. Hops are dominating in the best, juiciest way possible. Finish is semi-sweet with just a breath of alcohol (well hidden considering the ABV). Subtle lingering hoppy bitterness balances out things nicely.  Overall - The best DIPA I've had so far. This beer was smooth and juicy with a subtle sweetness, without being too cloying/syrupy. Immensely enjoyable and something I will most likely go back to in the bottle at my house (without any stinky bar smell to interfere).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Pours an amber clarity, with a decent white head. Lacing clings to the glass.  Dank pine, with notes of ripe black grape prod the nostrils, though polite in aroma strength. After those sensations comes a memory of sweet malt and bread.  The front of the tongue is prickled by pine & citrus rind, with a smooth, somewhat bitter, finish on the back of the tongue. The complex hop profile presents citrus and fruit, giving way to a smoother, diacetyl sulfur and booze. The sweet malt graininess hits rewind, as if to rewrite the front-end bitterness that came before it.

Much rather drink this ipa over any sierra nevada. Im not a sierra nevada fan. I could drink this IPA all day long like an all day ipa. May be 9% but does not phase me because I am american.

While obviously I wouldn't go so far to write off the ipa's that I'm sure are out there and better than this one, 90 minute IPA is perhaps one of the greatest experiences in an Imperial IPA I've had.  Beautiful golden red and chestnut brown body with a think white head and lace. Pours smooth and creamy. Smell is heavy in the malt and hop categories, very crisp and refreshing, a little citrusy. The taste follows the smell nicely but has a nice bitter coffee aftertaste. The hops punch your mouth in the face in a way that's balanced out nicely by the fruity esters and creamy mouthfeel.

Lacing is present Smell: Aroma of bread crust with a bit of pine. Taste: A sweet hit to the tip of the tongue gives way to piney bitterness. Taste quickly evolves to a bready, toffee malt concoction with fresh Northern woods in winter intertwining the malt. To me, there is some stone fruit and berry flavor in the finish and aftertaste, but I don’t find evidence that it should be there given the hops that were used. The hops profiles for the hops used in this beer should be citrusy, but I don’t get citrus at all. So, either the continuous hopping brings out something different in one of the hops or (more likely) I am misidentifying the flavor I am getting, it's weird though. Feel: Mouthfeel is tongue-coatingly full. There is plenty of carbonation. The carbonation feels smooth like a blanket rather than spiky like a cactus. Overall: This is one of my all-time favorites. It is one of the IPA’s that first attracted me to IPA’s. It is very malt forward and viscous. The malt and hops are exquisitely balanced. Despite a rating of 90 IBU’s I think this beer is gentle on the palate. This is world class beer, a classic that should be tasted for its place in beer history alone.

Oily lacing left on the side of the glass that slides right down into the beer leaving only a few traces where it started. A small carbonation geyser coming up from the bottom but not too strong. Just right, Head receded leaving a clear ring around the outside of the glass with the carbonation concentrated to the center. These are the tiniest carbonation bubbles I have seen ever. Its hard to even detect that there are individual bubbles on the surface. It looks like a cloud floating on the top of the ale. PERFECT!  S: Hops. Something else there but not sure what it is yet. Seems kind of like a musky piney earthy smell. Its nice but very unusual and hard for me to pinpoint. While the hops is up front, the smell is not aggressively strong. Its very nice and subtle. If I had a better olfactory set  T: Wow. Hops up front but not crushingly strong. Lots of complexity behind it. I am getting slightly sweet maltiness, pine, citrus and maybe caramel. At the very end is the ever so slight revelation of the ABV. It is very hidden. Extremely well blended and balanced.  M: Very smooth and creamy to start followed by the bite of the hops. Finally the bitterness is revealed and only in the back end can I slightly detect the warmth of the ABV. I would never guess that the ABV is 9 if I was blindfolded and not subject to the feeling of alcohol in my system.  O: This beer is a sleeper. Its fantastic. Its so complex and so well balanced that I keep asking myself what have I missed or what is missing here? I keep on finding more in the flavor. I want another one. This beer pulls all of it together into a cohesive mysterious lady. Be careful. She is very seductive and will lure you into her web of complexity.

Then we dry-hop it in every tank."" Brewed in the style of an American Imperial IPA. This is the big brother IPA to the 60 minute, available year round in 4 pack bottles and on draft. One of Dogfish Head's finest successes. this is a beer that revolutionized the hop addition process in brewing.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to the Dogfish Head Signature glass. Served north of 52º Fahrenheit.  (Appearance) Pours a frothy ivory head over a bold copper orange body with very high clarity. Carbonation is plentiful and varied. Retention is average, lacing is light and streaked. 3.75  (Smell) Caramel grain malt with a moderate sweetness. Smooth herbal, resinous and citrus hop blends intertwine with a modest bitterness. A moderate mineral earthiness is also present, hints of white grape, pear and honey add inviting depth to the aroma. Mild ethanol doesn't distract the aromatic diversity of this Double IPA. The balance of this beer is fantastic with just enough malt and hop character to keep things exciting. Potency is medium. 4  (Taste) Clean, smooth bready caramel malts collaborate with a resinous, floral and lemony hop profile. Bitterness is fantastic, just enough for a strong trailing bitterness but doesn't overshadow the malt character in the finish. I appreciate the unique use of British malts and a mild mineral profile which smooths out just about any gap in flavor this beer could have. I enjoy the high drinkability, flavor and balance that this beer has, it is a deserving standout beer amongst a world of Double IPAs. 4.5  (Mouthfeel) Smooth, clean, fluffy with a mild chewiness. Carbonation adds a middling crispness for a frothier texture. Body is medium for the style, medium+ overall. Alcohol presence is light to none. 4.25  (Overall) This is one of the most drinkable Double IPAs you can get for your money. With the perfect balance of hop and malt character I find little worthy of criticizing in this beer.

Smells great!  T: Great Odin's raven is this tasty! Sweet like and amber but punches back with a bouquet for hops that balances so well with the sweet malt they are almost one! Pineapple, honey , floral pine, lemon, slight moscato, light white pepper, earthy hops, biscuit with marmalade, and back to piney hops. Deep, dank, and super tasty!  M: Goes down smooth but coats the moth sticky and sweet! Just the slightest hint of booze.  O: Amazing! Easily one of my new favorites. Expertly crafted. The balance on this is incredible and so drinkable for 9%. Do yourself a favor and pick it up. It is worth it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,CA_brewster,4.54,"Appearance on this beer is awesome. Clear orange/copper color with a good head and tons of lacing down the entire glass. Delicious super resiny hop aroma that tickles the nose but not without some sweet malty characteristics coming across as well especially as it warms. The taste is incredibly balanced. I was expecting this to be a serious hop bomb and don't be mistaken this is quite a hoppy beer but compared to some west coast imperial or double IPA's the flavor of this brew is not dominated by it's hop qualities and one can really pick up on it's roasted malt characteristics. This is a great beer but I think that is pretty much common knowledge by this point. I honestly don't even really know why I bothered reviewing this. Go get some, it's damn good.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Das_Reh,4.21,"I would just like to apologize for my former score of 1.75. My palate was not ready for DIPA's and I judged too subjectively.

10099,2093,inglebk,4.78,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter.  A: Best looking DIPA I've seen. Copper Orange color and absolutely clear. One finger white head with awesome lacing all over. If there were a beer beauty pageant... Yeah.  S: Nice hops up front, alcohol, caramel.  T: No doubt my favorite tasting DIPA. There may be better out there but I haven't had it yet. Some say its too sweet but that happens to make it perfect for me. I love a hoppy beer with a big malt backbone and this is one for sure. The first thing I get is the sweet caramel and bready malts. The bitter hops take a second but eventually spread across the entire tongue. Pepper, spice, and some alcohol. Not 9% but a nice warming at the end.  M: Carbonation is perfect. Not thin at all. Nice syrupy stickiness.  O: I had to fight not to rate this beer a 5 because its perfection to me. Bottle over growler and tap hands down. I always have this in stock and handy somewhere. Makes it even better that 2 bottles put down quick can get you buzzin. The best offering from DFH and the best DIPA I've had.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,ThisWangsChung,3.33,"Re-review. 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  A: Pours a clear copper color. The cream-colored head has both a nice size - at three fingers high - and good frothiness. Retention is very good, also. No doubt, this is an aesthetically pleasing brew.  S: There really isn't much 'wow' with the aroma. Generally, it seems to bring a lot in the way of herbal and even tobacco qualities, rather than citrusy or tropical fruit ones. The caramel/toffee from the malt backbone is supremely evident, also. I'm not disappointed by the light hoppiness, even though it's not even a month old.  T: Slight herbal notes are quickly washed away by the big malt backbone. There is a large amount of caramel, toffee, marzipan, and even brown sugar. A touch of minty flavor lingers post-swallow, and there isn't an ounce of bitterness anywhere. I've always felt 90 Minute - if nothing else - had one of the better malt backbones among DIPAs, and that confirmation still rings true. A shame the hop profile can't keep up. Not only does the hop profile not keep up, but it becomes somewhat boozy after warming up sufficiently. Basically, it feels and tastes like it's 9%, no more, no less.  M: It really has a soft fullness that so many DIPAs lack. Buuuut, I don't want soft fullness in a DIPA, I want light crispness and a drinkability to bely its high ABV. It's reasonably drinkable, though the sweetness starts to haunt the palate after about half the bottle is gone.  O: Never had a DIPA before? Then give this a try - it's ridiculously easy to find (in most states), not bitter, and less than impossible to drink. For my personal tastes, it's still too malty. Even a measly year ago, this was a nice fall back option in my craft-derived portion of MD, but now that the selection is improving here, it's hard to muster any desire to purchase this again over other (superior) beers.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Michael_DuBois,4.69,"What's not to like about this hop heavy little jewel? It is clean and refreshing with a bouquet that made you feel as if you were walking amongst the hop fields of Willamette Valley on a crisp summer morning in the shadows of the rolling hills of the United States Northwest. Too poetic? Yeah, maybe.  This ale was freaking awesome though! The rich red color of the brew was a kin to the cap that kept it safe within its bottle. I released it from its holding into a pint glass adorning the logo of the Milwaukee Brewers. I keep company from the great state of Wisconsin....please don't tell my MN friends, they wouldn't understand. The first sip was strong with hops, citrus and my brain kept telling me there was a hint of arugula but no one in their right mind would introduce a peppery micro-green into an IPA. Nonetheless, I got notes of pepper and spice...and it was fantastic!  About half-way through the glass I began eating a spicy chili prepared by friend and that's when I really started to appreciate this arugula flavor that kept popping into my senses. Inexplicably, I poured the last ounce of beer into the remainder of my chili, stirred it about and then...CRUSHED IT! Intrigued by my actions, the rest of those in attendance poured a little of the beer into their bowls and followed suit. We all silently stood up from our chairs. Made our way into the kitchen. Fixed another bowl of chili and cracked the last 90 Minute IPA and divided it up amongst us....directly into our chili.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Sticky globs of lacing! Smell - floral and pine hop forward, but some caramel malts and candy. Taste - tasty bouquet of hops, well-balanced with caramel malts! Very easy to drink at 9%! Feel - a tremendously balanced DIPA, subtle hop bomb delicately matched by the malt profile! Overall - clearly a fantastic brew; however, for the price for a 4-pack in CO, I'd rather go with a few other DIPA's. R",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,BethanyB,4.25,"Appearance: The excellent clarity allows one to see the carbonation in the body of the beer, which is a dark gold color with an orange hue. Massive off-white head, with a creamy top that occasionally gives way to a good-sized bubble, kind of like boiling milk. The foam lasts until the bitter (pun only slightly intended) end.  Smell: The malt smells of freshly baked French bread. Yum! Plenty of citrus hops, and some tropical fruit. Tells me I'm in for a treat!  Taste: The French bread smell turns to buttered toast on the tongue, and mixes nicely with the citrus hop flavor. The tropical fruit is present as well, and its sweetness hits the palate right away, alongside an immediate bitterness. Combined, these sweet and bitter flavors almost produce a dark chocolate cheesecake taste.  Mouthfeel: Medium-light body, with medium-high carbonation.  Overall: A crisp, well-balanced, tasty IPA. Perfect balance between hop bitterness and flavor. The C hops, while prominent, are not over-the-top. The bitterness is high, but not harsh. An excellent choice for both hop heads, and people just getting into IPAs. For me, this was much preferable to the 60 minute IPA. Much more flavorful.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,polloenfuego,4.19,"Enjoyed from a tulip during a blackout Inna windstorm.  90 minute IPA came highly recommended to me by many beer friends. I had always avoided it because I assumed it would be over hoppy for me. I was wrong.  The beer poured a lovely copper color with a decent two finger head that lingered, eventually breaking down but not surrendering. The smell was citrus and pine with malts. The taste was, as I expected hoppy. But the hops was pleasant and robust. It was full of flavor and The caramel and malts that accompany them made for a pleasant experience. The mouth feel was smooth and drinkable with good carbonation and a nice warm feel left after you finish.

10099,2093,spoony,4.4,"From a 355 ml bottle into a tulip.  A-A normal pour produces about one and one-half finger of eggshell-colored foam. The head drops after a minute to a collar. There is some lace, but not as much as I would have expected given the hops in this thing. The brew is amber color and mostly clear.  S-The smell is big and mostly bitter with earthy, herbal pine and spicy, peppery orange scents. A fair amount of semi-sweet caramel malt is present, as well. Alcohol is warming and slightly fruity, but is mostly drown out by the oily hops.  T-The taste, like the smell, is big and quite bitter. I get zesty orange, pine, herbs, and white pepper. The malts are semi-sweet and provide a nice dose of caramel and fruit. The alcohol is warming and well-integrated. Old school and delicious.  M-The feel is pretty substantial with a good heft, moderate carbonation, and a fair bit of oily dankness to coat the palate.  O-This classic was one of my first big IPAs (now known as IIPAs) many moons ago when I first got into beer. I remember thinking it was so bitter and chewy that I could barely finish the bottle. My how my palate has changed as I gulp down the last drop this evening. Today's bottle was a reminder of what a good, old-school IIPA tastes like: bitter, herbal, full of pine, big hop oil, but with a healthy balance of caramel malt and well-integrated alcohol.

This IIPA was very thick and chewy with plenty of hops on the front end that gave way to a smooth vanilla malt finish.

Citrusy, piney and malty flavor with notes of tangerines, walnuts, grapefruits, resin, toasted malts, caramels, and finishing with earth and pepper. Dry aftertaste with a lingering bitterness from both hops and roasted malts. Full body with low carbonation with tiny bubbles. Alcohol of 9% abv is very well hidden.

The smell was fantastic, strong fumes of oranges, grapefruit rinds, with a pleasantly sweet scent that reminds me of flowers and honey. Some hops and bread as well.  As expected, beer is very hoppy and bitter. Bitterness and pine-ness is very similar to 60 minute IPA but intensified but it is balanced very well with sweet flavors that many IPAs do not do. This makes the beer more drinkable without making a face every time you throw some back. The beer finishes with a nice, crisp bready finish. I taste some nutty flavors, roasted malts, and spices that are tinkle the back of the mouth.  Beer is creamy and full-bodied, finishes off with a very refreshing, crisp feel to it.

10099,2093,HookerBrews,4.65,"For my second review, I am choosing to do another Dogfish Head. I simply can't get enough of the complexity and unbelievable flavors that this staple craft brewery is able to produce. As I review, I am watching an episode of Brew Masters, which follows Dogfish founder, Sam Calgione, and his adventures into off-centered ales.  Appearance: The 90 Minute pours a rich, golden, and very slightly cloudy amber color. Its appearance is rather effervescent, especially for an IPA, and looks almost like a saison in the glass. The head retains fairly well and has a pleasant ivory color with bubbly, enticing lacing.  Smell: As an expertly crafted IPA, the usual aroma suspects are present in this beer. A big, but not overpowering, whiff of sweet hops hits your nose along with the smell of mild lemon. The aroma has a backbone that I can't quite identify, but my mind says juniper berries and very slight hint of the high alcohol content.  Taste: As any lover of the 60 Minute IPA will tell you, Dogfish knows how to pack a big punch when it comes to hops. The 90 Minute is certainly no exception, but it doesn't really have the huge hoppyness that the 60 Minute has. The hops are present in full force, to be sure, but something else is at work in the flavor other than a hopped-up assault. A blend of sweet and bitter hops hits your tongue, immediately followed by a deep, bitter hop profile that has an unusual malty note to it. The after taste is an intense mix of hoppy bitterness, lemon grass, and a strangely bready taste reminiscent of sour dough that really lingers in your mouth. This brew is definitely not for slugging back and is really meant to be enjoyed slowly and deliberately. For an IPA, the whole flavor profile is quite unexpected and complex. The continual hopping process clearly adds a unique dimension to the brew and the distinctive hop blend becomes more pronounced as it warms up in the glass.  Mouthfeel: This is a medium-bodied brew with very active carbonation that bubbles all across your tongue. The beer achieves a very full texture that is quite fizzy and effervescent.  Overall: This is far from your average IPA. It's amazing how 30 more minutes of boiling and hopping can make the 90 Minute so different from the 60 Minute. This is a true imperial IPA that tastes mature and commands respect. Dogfish, as always, has achieved something unique and complex with this brew. Many IPAs seem to measure themselves by the amount of hops they can cram in. The 90 Minute is hopped generously and the bitter punch is certainly there, but there is a rich flavor that makes this a really wonderful beer that stands out from the rest.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,dc87,4.19,"A - Thick, slightly off white head. Dark amber/copper body.  S - A nice and interesting smell. Some citrus and floral hops, with just as much sweetness.  T - A complex and emphatic taste, though not 'big' or overwhelming. Up front, a rich taste comprising of fruity hops and some sweetness. This is followed by some sweet and syrupy notes. Surprising but pleasant levels of sweetness given that this is an imperial IPA, and a little more than I'd hope for. Ultimately quite a dry aftertaste.  M - Medium bodied. An exciting and slightly tangy level of carbonation.  O - Very interesting, distinct and drinkable.

Aroma: Intense, oily hop notes with some pine...can smell some nutty breadiness as well. Nuttiness becomes more pronounced as it warms.  Taste: Big hop explosion just a moment after it initially hits the palate, serious bitterness balanced out by some sweet malt character. More of the nutty flavor towards the finish, and almost a roasty malt quality as well.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, medium body with light but lively carbonation. Very smooth.

10099,2093,stacket1,4.33,"Had this outside during summer at Baltimore harbor.  Appearance: amber/caramel, no head, bubble rolling rising from the bottom  Smell: hard to ascertain over odor of harbor, but generally was hoppy  taste: Heavy with hops and caramel. Not subtle but hid the high ABV well.  Mouthfeel: thinner than I would have expected from such a strong beer, but was nice to sip and savor  Overall: solid, strong IPA, that was smooth and went too quickly. First drink of the night but easily could have overwhelmed food that did not have strong flavor.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Spikester,4.25,Clear amber with a two fingers of off white head that lasts and good amount of lace. Smell is floral light pine hops and lots of malt. Taste is bitter hops with good amount of bready malts. A bit sweet with a tasty amount of bitter hops. Mouthfeel is full with good amount of carbonation. Finish lightly dry and eventually bitter. Overall a fine beer for this style. The alcohol is virtually undetected so watch out.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,drunkheathen,4.14,"This beer has a very amber golden color, with a nice foam head that lasts for a little while. The first smell I got of was noticeable pine, hops, and citrus. Taste was mild hops, somewhat bitter and a slight taste of the alcohol, but not too much. Very little aftertaste, went down smooth and refreshing considering the ABV. My overall impression for this beer is its a very solid and enjoyable beer, definitely looking forward to this one again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,constantine_272,4.29,"A: Very nice dark amber copperish gold. Well carbonated leaving a steady thin layer of very white foam. Ever so slight haze.  S: Orange rind. Slightly sweet with barley and rye bread notes. Dark brown sugar and molasses. Dried pine needles. Walnut and leather. Sweet smelling with a huge amount of richness backing it. A bit of alcohol.  T: Sweet biscuit notes are the first bits I pick up. Again sweetness of molasses and brown sugar. Woodiness like applewood and hickory. Takes 180 And finishes dry with notes of dried leaf and tanginess of orange rind and maybe a touch of grapefruit. Finishes dry with a mouthwatering saltiness. Long and very mild finishing aftertaste of copper.  M: Finishes extremely dry with very little aftertaste. Slight syrupy consistency, but to be expected from such a big beer.  O: I'm quite impressed. Huge diverse flavor profile without any one flavor jumping out and taking over; each flavor profile seems to have its moment to shine. Well rounded and balanced. Only criticism is that it's just a bit on the big side. It's got a high abv and finishes very very dry, which means one is more than enough for me. Forgivable since developing this much flavor in a smaller beer is pretty near impossible.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Mostly clear, very dark caramel color with two fingers of fluffy white head, that laces with every sip, and all the slow way down, and much carbonation. Good looking.  S: The smell is woody and alcoholic with the citric hops. A bit sweet, caramel malt and a gas pump.  T: The hop flavor is grapefruit and pine, atop sweet, roasted caramel malts. The finish is again gas fumey, alcoholic. This is a sipping DIPA, with salt, pepper and fire too. Complex, firey, and too much alcohol for me, even in a DIPA.  M: Full bodied, a bit cloying. Not that refreshing or cleansing which is the tickle I look for in a beer. Instead of a make out session, it's more like I ate too much candy, sticky, sweet, busy.  Not a top DIPA. Not a top IPA.

Unfortunately, much of it dissipated quickly. Still a gorgeous beer to look at.  S - Plenty of malts: bready and yeasty, as well as a whole grain aroma. Hops are king, though. Earthy, spicy and slightly fruity. Pine, slight amount of dirt. Pepper spice of several varieties: red, black, white, and chili powder. Very slight citrus notes, lime sticks out most to me.  T - Very complex, just as the aroma. Malt backbone is very strong, which I prefer in hoppy beers. Heavy whole grain bread taste, especially just after the swallow. Earthy notes not as prevelant as the aroma, but some dirt and pine are noticeable. Very bitter overall. Lot's of spiciness to the hops. Chili powder and red pepper immediately come to mind. Slight amount of citrus fruit toward the back end. Outstanding and complex taste.  F - Alcohol is almost unoticeable. Very nice finish, I think the strong malt backbone contributes to that. Fairly dry finish. A strong and powerful beer, but easy to drink.  O - One of the best, just outside my top 10. Very complex flavor. Lot's of characteristics to both the hops and the malts. I believe the best IPA's/DIPA's have an outstanding malt backbone, as this one does. Very unique with the peppery tastes.

The nose on this is out of control. Juicy, creamy pineapple - smells like an umbrella drink. The flavor is so solid and well structured, I'd say perfectly balanced malt and citrusy hops. Undetectable booze on 9% abv, and a clean, clean finish. This is just a perfectly balanced, delicious IIPA. Beautifully done.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

This is a sweet tasting IPA, and with strong grapefruit coming through.  Smell is of light fruity tropical hops: mango, grapefruit, blood orange, and strong bready malt character. The smell of mango doesn't really come through on the taste,but it's there in the smell.  This is known to be a world class beer, and I would have to say it's at least a very good Double IPA. I would have to say it's better than the Double Jack, and some others I've had in recent memory.

It's been quite some time since I've last had this beer, so I got a four pack of this along with a six pack of Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA, which I just revisited recently also.  Poured into a clear balloon snifter glass.  A - Pours two fingers of creamy sudsy beige colored head on top of a hazed burnt sienna orange colored body. Beautiful strands of thick lacing.  S - Smell is of light fruity tropical hops: mango, grapefruit, blood orange, and strong bready malt character. A bit coppery / metallic on the finishing end. While not necessarily as pungent and fruity as other DIPA's, this beer has a well-balanced nose.  T - Taste follows the nose, and is a few notches more bitter and warmer than it's little brother, Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA. Creamy and smooth body, perfect carbonation, big fruity bitter hops, pine, grapefruit, and a wonderfully balanced biscuit malt backbone. Bit of alcohol warmth from this beer's big 9.00% abv, but the alcohol is substantially well hidden.  M - Feel is smooth and creamy, with some lingering pine resins & coppery aftertaste. As it warms, it just becomes even creamier and delicious.  Overall, a worthy successor to Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA, but less sessionable with a higher 9.00% abv. Still, a smooth, creamy, extremely drinkable DIPA from Dogfish Head, definitely one of their best beers by far. Another classic example of the style, one that I tend to overlook too often.

10099,2093,ISmith87,4.59,"This beer has a character all in it's own. Sweeter than most of the imperial IPA's out there, it still has a balance to it that ranks it among the best. Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a stout/porter glass...  Appearance - 5.0 - Beer is an amber/copper color that is crystal clear. 2 fingers of off white head that laces the glass as it dissipates into a thin film on top of the beer. And that's without sipping it yet. Leaves sparse lacing as you drink it.  Smell - 4.75 - Floral/citrusy hops that are balanced by hints of onion and garlic. Not so much malt backbone, but it is there with some bread smell.  Taste - 4.50 - garlic and onion are a little stronger in the taste than in the smell, but they are clean and balanced out by a floral hops flavor that is also there. Hop bitterness is present with an alcohol bite (9% ABV).  Mouthfeel - 4.50 - light-medium mouthfeel with a medium carbonation that is characterized by an alcohol and hop bite. Aftertaste is of strong floral/bitter hops, and slight alcohol.  Overall - 4.50 - What makes this beer great is it's original character. With strong floral hops it's slightly different from the citrusy imperial ipa's such as Ruination/Ruinten/Hopslam. It's light comparing roses to grapefruit. Both are good but they're still completely different. I would keep this beer around just to compare to other IPAs, since it is so unique.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Kinda malt heavy, some clove and hints of allspice. 3.75  Taste-strong bitter hops at the front of the tongue. Then sweeter the rest of the way. Very even thru-out, can't say I've had a double this balanced. 4  Feel-full bodied, ABV is right where it needs to be, drinkable. 4.25  Overall-been waiting awhile to try this one, I must say I didn't expect what I got.

Both smell and taste feature pine, citrus, grapefruit, and floral notes/flavors. It's a bit spicy, the ABV is well concealed. The citrus seems to be a bit unbalanced, but the beer is still far more complex than I can appreciate.

T - Very well balanced with the malt and the bite of the hops. Excellent taste all around and I'm glad I can appreciate it more fully. This beer is both spicy and bitter at the same time, without either note dominating.  M - Light carbonation, a little bit of spice on the tongue but overall a very smooth and pleasant mouthfeel.

M: Lighter bodied than most Imperials I've tried. Sweet, refreshing, and not cloying. Excellent carbonation with this one, remarkable head retention.

S: Floral, slightly citrus hops, and hints of alcohol. Sweet malt as well.  T: Much more malty than I expected honestly, balance is nice none the less however. Floral, citrus, and even a tad peppery or spicy hop flavors can be detected. Alcohol is of little concern and only becomes noticeable as the beer warms.  M: Body is lighter than I expected as well, not that this is a bad thing at all because it makes the beer easier drinking and less filling. Carbonation is well done and perhaps better then I found 60 minute.  O: An American craft classic and rightfully so.

Smell: The front is a bitter sweet barley presence. A crisp hoppy body to the aroma. Accents of caramel, molasses, and soy sauce make for an interesting aroma.  Taste: Similar to the aroma, the barley front blasts through. Sugary barley, caramel, molasses, and bourbon. There is a slightly floral hop body with a gummy texture. The finish is a medium dry with more accents of straw, grass, and barley.  Mouthfeel: Easy drinking for 9% abv. Low on the bitterness. Heavier malt presence sticks around for a while.

10099,2093,Caj1,4.28,"Well, I'd been putting this one off for a while since every time I was at the local package store something else caught my eye first. First impressions weren't all that great, to be honest; I popped the top on one of these a few days ago and wasn't the biggest fan, but I reserved harsh judgement at the time. Every beer except the worst of the worst deserves a second chance. That in mind, I'm reviewing this beer, my second of the four pack, as I drink it.  The initial pour gave me a lot of head... a lot; probably I poured too hard. Oh well, no real harm done. The head is slightly off-white, really frothy, dissipates very slowly. I've let it sit for about five minutes and I still have three-quarters of a finger remaining, with a lot of lacing. Color is a very pretty medium-dark amber, closer a very deep straw color when held to the light. It's not crystal clear but I'm not struggling to see through it, and there are a lot of carbonation bubbles rising to the surface with a good deal of vigor.  Smell is good... sweet and complex. Pine, grass and grapefruit predominate at first, with some more fruity ester smell. Some alcohol hits the back of the nose and palate, but it's very faint. Underneath the hops is some diacetyl butterscotch smell and some nice bready malt, almost like cookies.  The first sip reveals more butterscotch immediately before it's swiftly replaced with fruity and slightly astringent hops, really nice. Fruity flavors predominate, some citrus and another fruity sweetness I can't quite put my finger on; I'm not sure whether it's hops or grain, but either way it's good overpowering. They did a good job of masking the flavor of the alcohol. I can taste it ever so slightly, but it helps add flavor rather than detract from it. The piney, grassy notes are more subdued than I'd imagine, which is a shame since I really enjoy those and look for that in an IPA. After the swallow the fruity sweetness remains for a while, hanging back and not really going anywhere, which is fine with me. The astringent qualities of the hops comes through more and more in between sips; if I wait longer, I get more of those flavors, and they taste kind of like a ruby red grapefruit. Mouthfeel is full-bodied, a little oily from the hops and has the tiniest bit of burn from the alcohol; on another note, the sugars in the beer leave the lips a little bit sticky.  My overall impression of this beer is that it's quite good, but a bit overhyped; I'm sensing a pattern here with Dogfish Head beers. They're good and I'd be glad to drink them, I appreciate what the guys at Dogfish Head are doing, but I feel they're slightly overhyped and overpriced. My main complaint with this brew is that it's just too damn sweet; I realize it may be a matter of personal taste, but I prefer lighter, more bitter flavors with my IPAs. All that said, you'd be missing out if you didn't at least try this beer. Cheers to good health and good beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

You can see the intensity of the carbonation and cloudiness, culminating in an alcoholic monster that looks you in the eye and dares you to drink it. The aroma is rich with hoppiness. My tongue could see past the hop attack and pick up the pine and citrus that leaned more towards mango. The malt component helps to balance out what would otherwise become a near-fatal, but welcome, overdose of hops.

Best poured cold out of the fridge just to control the super thick wonderful head that just keeps building.  This is a very hop forward beer with a distinct malt backbone. This is a beer made for sipping to savor every drop.  Sip at room temp to catch all of the subtleties in the hops and malts.  To me, I like to sip it in with an equal amount of air like a fine wine, roll it around on my tongue, catching the alcohol the hops and malts, then swallow.  It's a very sexy beer with a taste that lingers on your tongue making your taste buds scream for more.

Clear and orange/ brown in color. Smells very piney with nice sweetness behind it. Gives off some pineapple smell as well. Fruity and a little floral.  When you first sip this IPA the first thing that hits your tongue is bitterness which quickly gives way to some sweetness and fruit. Good carbonanation. Once you swallow immediately bitterness starts to arise and gets stronger and stronger but never unpleasant. Bitterness lingers for a little but take another sip and the whole experience from bitter, to sweet, to bitter happens all over again. Amazing!  The bottle claims to be 9% ABV but personally I don't smell or taste any of it but you feel it afterward. Nice kick in the pants after an amazing beer. Go give this beer a try.

S: I get mostly a caramel sweet smell. There is a faint citrus smell a bit like smelling the outside of an orange where the smell isn't strong but still comes across. It's not that remarkable.  T: Very full of flavor. There's a rich toasty (not burnt) flavor similar to eating a fresh biscuit, a real grain flavor comes across. There's a back-bitterness to the beer that isn't too strong. A bit of pine flavor. No alcohol flavor which I feel is important to note, due to it being 9.0% ABV.  M: It drinks remarkably lighter than the beer really is. There is no overwhelming sensations in the beer that throw it off. It feels very full in the mouth, but a bit syrupy at times. A bit sticky when drinking. It also feels a bit under-carbonated, but the carbonation seems to work well with the malt flavors.  O: Overall this is a good go-to beer if you're looking for a nice well-rounded IIPA. It's not something to go for if you want a lot of hop flavor; this seems to focus more on bitterness.

Bright caramel amber, thick bodied, and with some of the most impressive lacing I've ever seen. The glass is frigging coated in the stuff. First rate.  Nose is quite sweet, very malty. Rich caramel and sugar, before a good blast of sweet citrus and resin hops comes through. Quite nice.  A sweeter imperial ipa that delivers the hops in parcels of citrus, resin, and mild cone without being as overwhelming as one might expect. Tangerine, mango, sweet grapefruit. A slow sipper indeed, though I am rewarded with a lovely fresh caramel flavour in the finish of each dip.  Smooth, creamy feel, quite silky. A real tongue coater.

It’s got a raspberry kind of flavor, almost soapy, bit of caramel.  Claims to be high on the IBU, but I don’t taste it as that bitter. Pretty drinkable for the ABV.  Used to like it a lot more, but it’s not as good as it used to be in my eyes",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,xrumer,3.64,"I'm a little confused with this beer. I guess i was expecting more bitterness from the hops. It almost taste like 2-row took the front seat and hops took the back seat.

10099,2093,hokieguy95,4.94,"in a snifter glass.  A: deep bronze. Nice lacing from the hops. About a finger head. A beautiful beer. Very clear  S: piney, and a nice citrus nose as it warmed. Extremely balanced nose especially after the warming period with the malts and hops intermingling. I can smell the malt, biscuity profile towards the end of my glass.  T: Hops are piney but not overpowering. The malts offer great compliment to the hop bite. Bready almost biscuity that pushes to the forefront of the hops. Not as balanced as I once thought. Very malty upfront with juicy hops in the finish with no astringent hop bite. Alcohol is nicely hidden.  M: oily hops and a light to medium mouthfeel overall.  O: First off. I am not your A-typical Hop head. I am very particular about them. Of the DIPA's I've tried this is the go to for me. Malty upfront with hops kick. Make no mistake, this is a Hop A-Bomb. If there is a better DIPA, I have not tried it.

10099,2093,fizzgig,4.3,"The ""Imperial"" adjective has unfortunately become necessary to indicate what IPAs originally were in the Victorian era when they were designed for export from England to the far reaches of British Empire to far off and warm places like India. They were specially designed with high original gravities (lots of malt) so they would continue to condition during the long journey and all the hops were an antibacterial preservative. ""Imperial"" is a decent adjective but I would have coined ""Victorian IPA"" as a nod to the historical roots of true IPAs. Nothing you won't learn perusing Michael Jackson's many writings.  A: Dark copper, thin clingy head that wants to stick around for quite a while.  S: Has the typical resiny IPA smell but not as sharp or unpleasant as most IPAs. Maybe caramel and/or toffee I presume from all the malt that comes off a close second to the hops.  T: Definitely dominated by bitters as you would expect from 90 IBU, but not as sharp or unpleasant as most IPAs. The malt comes through with toffee/caramel and supports it nicely helping to balance it out as it does not cause lemon face as I expected. Bitters linger but not overbearingly so. The 9% ABV is hardly noticeable at the time but shows up later.  M: Compare to most cheap thinly malted beers it seems syrupy, but this is a good thing if you crave beers with substance. Carbonation mild and doesn't get in the way of all the flavors.  O: Easily the best IPA I've had to date and I do not favor IPAs in general. I call most IPAs and APAs ""hop waters"" due to their pathetic lack of malt for the sake of cost and they just taste like chalk or bitter soap. This one has restored my faith that the Victorian IPA is not dead (despite being classified American IPA). This is not a casual everyday beer (it's a bit expensive) but something to go with a rich meal, Texas BBQ would pair well.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

This is a very malty DIPA.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation with a bitter hoppy dry finish.  Overall: This is a fairly sweet DIPA, not an explosion of hops that I was expecting unlike Double Trouble and Ruination. It is fairly sweet, too sweet in my opinion from the barley and the malt. It is a great balanced beer and I would definitely have it again. It is very unique. I definitely want to try this on a blind taste.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Thin half finger of wispy off-white froth. Moderate retention efforts and a bit of spotty lace down the glass.  S: Aroma is slightly bland with sweet caramel malts controlling a greater portion of the nose. There is a light twist of citrus fruit and some herbal spice coming through with a mild metallic twinge to it.  T: Firm caramel malt presence with sweetened bread and a hit of citrus peels on the backend. Mixed in with some pine and spiced herbs. Light sticky sweetness but not lingering or resinous. There is a fair amount of overall hop bitterness to the beer and the alcohol is kept well in check throughout the drink. Pretty nice balance and decent hops to pair with the malt forward East coast style. A definite step up from the nose.  M: Moderate fullness with some light frothy spritzing from the carbonation. A bit sticky feeling with an upper moderate constricting bitterness and rather clean finish.  D: I am not a huge Dogfish consumer but this is not bad by any means. Malt forward and slightly sweeter than I care for but with a nice hoppy punch of flavor. Seems like a mix of American and English hop varities used.

10099,2093,bbluemzbeer,5,"This is is Amazing Beer! I am not a big fan of this style but one thing sold me is the after taste does not taste like Pine Sol cleaner. Most of ipa have a pine sol lingering in your mouth after taste which I hate. It is not cheap but I treat myself to a four pack once in a while.  .Appearance: A great looking cloudy orange with amber color with a frothy head.  Smells: caramel, vanilla , pine and little clove.  Taste: Some bitterness on the tongue and some malt takes over. Finishes slightly bitter but not overe powering. Some hint of citrus and chocolate kind of taste in there as well. Real well balanced but  Mouthfeel- Overall great mouthfeel.  Overall: I am glad I tried this beer a year ago. Awesome IPA with great taste , balance, smell and no harsh pine sol after taste.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

T: Tropical fruit candy, well balanced, not blasting my taste buds off with atomic energy as some ipas would. Alcohol present but well hidden. Its smooth. Some bitter aftertaste like a grapefruit. Pine for sure. Extreme balance as there is a low level of sweetness. Sweet, bitter, fruity, spicy, a tropical medly in balance. Honestly, I burp pine.  M: Heavy body, low carbonation. Smooth and syrupy but does not cling to the mouth.  O: For sure a great beer, and I can see why its considered one of the best. Is this the best beer I’ve had? I think not, but for sure its up there.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Settles quickly leaving a thick ring around the rim, and a smattering of bubbles on the surface. Very spotty lacing mostly retreats back into the body of the brew.  S: Nutty and woody roasted malt base. Pine resin and a little clove.  T: Slightly sweet and piney. Woody roasted malt. Bitter pecan shell and orange rind. No components overpowering, very well-balanced.  M: Full, hearty, and syrupy. Slightly bitter aftertaste, but surprisingly not too much.  D: Sip and enjoy. The bitter character and heft will dictate it.  Atmosphere is really nice. Dark hue, slight bubbly white head, and a touch of lacing. Nose is a woody, and roasty with plenty of pine and a little spice. Flavor is a well-balanced combination of pine, bitter pecan, a little citrus on a woody roasted malt base. Full and hearty. Overall, this is a great quaff.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Taste is really malty with a lot of citrus and sweetness. For a 90 IBU beer, this comes off not very bitter at all. The bitterness is there but the sweetness covers it up nicely. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied. Pretty thick for an IPA. Carbonation is just above average. Overall, I love this IIPA. Dogfish Head have done it again. They're known for their strange beers and this is no exception. Wow. I need to find 120 minute IPA now.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I was expecting a lot more hops on the nose.  T- Slight bitterness on the front of the tongue. Great malt backbone takes over mid palette and continues on into the finish. Finishes slightly bitter. Some caramel malt flavors, vanilla, toffee maybe? Definitely a subtle hint of citrus and grapefruit. I get almost a cocoa/chocolate kind of taste in there as well. Pretty well balanced but leaning toward the malty side on this one.  M- Great overall mouthfeel. Slightly carbonated.  O- Very glad that I finally tried this brew. I am a big fan of the 60 and 75 minutes and this just out shined both of them.

The smell is very hoppy and awesome, however the taste is balanced with big malt flavor. Even at 9% abv it is very drinkable and has a nice finish that wants you to go back for more.

T: Sweet malts backed up by honey and toffee notes. Very malt forward IPA.  M: Medium carbonation with a prickly hoppy aftertaste. Flavors stick around for a while.  O: This is a pretty nice beer, and it has a killer mouthfell and aftertaste, but I don't think it's world class. I'm all for malty IPAs, but this one is a little too sweet for me.

Citrus and sweetness can also be detected.  T: Much like the aroma. Hops dominate with plenty of pine, floral and sweet flavors. The alcohol is fairly noticeable but worth it to get the great hop flavors out.  M: Standard beer mouthfeel with medium carbonation.  Overall, a great example of the style. Not for the faint of heart though; it takes a real hophead to fight through the bitterness to enjoy the complex hop flavors but well worth it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Pour is nice golden orange amber with thing off white head, fading quickly.  Nose is nice but a bit a bit subdued, but still a nice amount of citrus and soft hop.  Flavor is a little muted from the age, but still a nice burst of juicy fruit. Mango, honeysuckle, and some pineapple are most prominent, followed by thick but biting hops.  Feel is thick and full, leaving a nice resin stick in your mouth.  Great beer. Need to have it again fresh to really assess it's greatness.

It even LOOKS like a beer that is to be respected. Not yellow and certainly not dark, but a nice deep gold color with a beautiful white head. It is not a heavy beer for being a 9%-er. Definitely tasty tho. Soooo....watch out! This beer has me wondering what the 120 IPA would be like. Haven't had that one yet. Had the 60 IPA...and it was pretty good. This one, (90 min), is a quality beer. A step above.  Den",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,kristenspaintings,4.75,"This is a GREAT beer.  Dogfish has a way of uncovering flavors I didn't know were in hops and barley. There are so many layers to this that it's an experience you have to repeat several times before you can work out all the them.  It has a bitter taste that's a requirement of the style but it's not overpowering or unpleasant bitterness. The other flavors are strong though. They won't let you forget what you're drinking or take a back seat to any food. You can drink this with the spiciest of spicy foods and it'll hold its own.  If you think you don't like IPAs I'd encourage you to give this a try. In fact, it's a must-try if you claim to enjoy craft beers at all.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,BrianJohnson,5,"This is by far the best IPA I have ever had. The malt balance on the hops is absolutely outstanding. The smell is what you'd expect - piny and citrusy.

10099,2093,MRAnderson,4.29,"A: Dark golden almost brassy color with very little head and quite a bit of alcohol legs oh the glass. It is a very filtered beer. leaving a very transparent ,see through beer with no sentiment what so ever. The head when poured aggressively, is a creamy, frothy,with tight bubbles as well as glazed over appearance.  S: very sweet, mangoes, Tropical fruits, sweet malts, the alcohol comes through big time as well, aside from honey, this is Hop slam on Steroids! I would say it lacks the pineapple aspect but it is so fruity with that alcohol just smacking you in the face! I enjoy this smell of this beer completely!  T: Malty sweetness with lots of Fruitiness on the front end with alcohol and hopy goodness on the middle to back end of this beer. There is almost a hint of chocolatey malt on the front end of this beer, its a very interesting DIPA! It tastes great but i have to put it a notch below the greats. The sweet Malts really dominate this beer.  M: Medium Mouth feel with not an overabundance of carbonation in my opinion. The mouth feel is almost thin which allows this beer to go down rather easily.  O: a very solid double imperial ipa! I would drink this again! The Malts really dominate this beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,lordofstarside,3.88,"From the total wine growler station today  Pours a dark gold with two fingers of foam that have kept excellent retention . Good transparency, little carbonation, some good lacing. Smells of hops, citrus, strong malts, and some alcohol. Some pine and peach come through also. Taste follows the nose well, hops, very sweet malts, citrus undertones and floral notes. A little bit of booze, but the sugar is what really jumps out and hangs around. The feel is medium bodied and creamy. The sweetness really hurts the drinkability, also really cuts into the bitterness. The liter I have of it might be a little much  Overall this stuff is well made but I wouldn't care for it often, just too sweet",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,yottachem,4.28,"Served in a tulip.  Appearance: Copper with ruby highlights. Medium-coarse, off-white head. Head dissipates quickly, no lacing.  Aroma: More caramel than bready notes compared to 60 min. Ethanol, light citrus/spicy hop aroma dominates. Some woody, vanilla, barrel-like notes are barely perceptible. Perhaps some apricot in the back of the nose. Aroma much sweeter when compared to 60 min.  Flavor: Malt up front, yeilds to hop bitterness but ebb and flow present in 60 min is not present. Malt is not bready, much more caramel sweet, but not quite ""raisin-like"" sweetness. Hops are very firm (bitter throughout taste) and resinous bitters linger. Presence of alcohol is unquestionable. There are no barrel-like flavors, as noted in the nose.  Mouthfeel: Medium body and medium carbonation (although I'd prefer a bit more carb for this). Alcohol bite in finish and resinous bitter remains for quite some time.  Overall. Definitely not just a bigger version of 60 min. More caramel malt and hop dynamic is not present but is compensated by the bump in ABV while keeping an appropriate balance. Perhaps a bit hyped, but a solid IPA. Definitely preferred over 60 min if I had the choice. Malt is showcased more here compared to the 60 min where the hops are the centerpiece.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I was pleasantly surprised. This beer pours a wonderful amber color, hazy in composition with a bit of sediment through out. On the nose, I pick up floral and sweet scents and the taste follows suit. It delivers the typical bitterness of an IPA but pairs it with some sweet notes. As someone who is not traditionally an IPA lover, I can say I'd buy this one again.  4.3/5.0",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,SFNC,4.57,"To me Dogfish Head's 90 Minute IPA is a standard of great beers, not just IPA's or DIPA's. DFH gets a ton of criticism for their more more esoteric, and sometimes unsuccessful experimental brews, but this one they have nailed. A perfect balance of astringent hops and luscious malt, it still a classic. It pours a rich orange with a modest head, but great lacing throughout the drinking period. The smell does not overwhelm, but is rich with pine, herbal and a light citrus scent. The taste is what makes this a great one. Even after having dozens of these over the years, I marvel at the complexities presented.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,timn,4.47,"A: Amber with a medium, slightly bubbly head. Carbonation is very visible in spite of the darker color of the beer. Pretty normal.  S: Sort of a grassy / floral type of smell. The hops are definitely there, but don't come through nearly as strong as you'd think for a double-IPA. Most IPAs I've had have a powerful, hoppy aroma, but this one is rather understated.  T: Very nice, complex taste. Again, the hops are there, but defintely not overpowering like you might expect. They are balanced by a sweetness -- honey or caramel or something similar -- that comes through slightly stronger than the hops. There is also again some grassy / floral type of flavor.  M: Interesting mouthfeel. It is probably medium in terms of thickness, but has a viscous, almost sticky quality to it, which is unique out of the beers I have tried. The carbonation is noticeable.  O: Very nice beer. Surprisingly sweet and not as hoppy or bitter as you might expect for a double-IPA, but it works very nice overall, along with a unique mouthfeel. I'm not sure that I found it quite as amazing as listed here, but there isn't' much to knock about it either.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I’m glad I did, because this exceeded my expectations based on its BA score.  Appearance – Pours a clear orange amber color with a creamy thick head and light spotted lacing.  Smell –At first I noticed some very nice maltiness, which is not typical for a DIPA – but I like it! A light floral smell, with pine and honey… a great hop scent! Better than most of the California hop bombs I’m used to.  Taste – Malt, pine, honey and a very nice hop flavor. I like that’s it doesn’t have an overpowering hoppiness to it.  Mouthfeel – Lightly carbonated, very smooth, and slightly oily – in a good way. A quick hint of the 9%abv in the aftertaste, then it's gone.  Drinkability – Definitely one of the top IPAs I’ve had. Not overly hoppy, not overpowered by citrus, and includes some malt that I really like. Very well done!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,artoolemomo,3.96,"Appearance- Pours up a fair amount of head which is a little yellowish white color. The body is your typical IPA body, light amber, amber honey with a good amount of translucence. Looks like this one is going to take a while- there a lot of big bubbles in this but no lacing yet. Secondary and tertiary pours only leave a minimal amount of lacing.  Nose- At this point, it's not very intense but appears to a fairly typical IPA head. Citrus, pine, grass, and soap. Citrus (orange and lemon) is the dominant flavor note but still nothing remotely overpowering. It's opening up a little bit but still has the same profile as before. A little bit of the alcohol starts to come out.  Taste- Oaky, woody bitterness is the first note along with some malty, bready sweetness. The bitterness continues to dominate the flavor profile but then flattens out into a weak, watery astringency(?). Some fruity notes, orange, maybe melon. Earwax and wood are still dominate with sweet malt not being as apparent as what I remember last time. The alcohol provides a nice little backbone and I suppose the malt does as well but I still would rather it not be present. It is better than I remember although it does seem a little watery. I will be revising my score to a higher one but it's still just an above average to good imperial. This is getting a little better- the wood is smoothing out and I can taste matchstick and melon more.  Mouthfeel- Not too shabby. Maybe a little heavier than I would like but it does have some smooth creaminess with the right amount of carbonation. It would like this to be crisper but the mouth on this isn't bad. As the opens up, the mouthfeel is contributing more and more to the overall structure of the beer. In a good way.  Drinkability- Pretty easy going- heat is only a factor if you let it linger in your mouth. Nice beer for a spring/summer day.  Overall- Much better than I remember and I may have to return to some of Dogfish Head's other brews. It was starting off as a B+ but I think now it is an A-.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The head is fruity and bitter at first sniff. Notes of pungent hops are on full display. The taste resembles more over-the-top IPAs, but with a balanced complexity and smooth finish.

S- a total mix of caramelly malt and herbal hops. it's rather pungent but not totally pleasant. maybe just confusing to my senses.  T- that is exactly what a double IPA is supposed to taste like. It's a hop bomb, it's bitter, it's a crash course in citrus vs. herbal, but a slight amount of malty stickiness is left on the teeth.  M- It's very spritzy. it's semi dry. medium to medium-light bodied.  O- Not a bad DIPA at all, but not my favorite.

In the nose, strong caramel flavors, with hop flavors barely noticeable. There is some orange marmalade. Quite full-bodied and sweet. I think the hop flavors have receded after these two months and I feel it's unfair to review it based on such an old bottle. However, this is what was available to me at the store, so others may find it in the same condition. It's still pleasant and balanced, just lacks the fresh hop flavor I was expecting. Probably closer to a Scotch Ale at this point, with its caramel dominance. Drinkability is high, alcohol doesn't stand out.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Smell is not unpleasant, but not very IPA-ish. Bready, warming malt profile like a good helles bock. The problem here is that it is not a helles bock. Where are the hops?  Taste is a bit more on course. Slight piney hop bitterness, but predominantly malt on the tongue.  Mouthfeel is pretty standard. Move along.  Idk if I got a bad bottle or if DFH just missed the mark, bit I'm disappointed.

I'm not a huge fan of most pale ales, but this taste is almost a mixture between a pale ale and a darker beer. The flavor is robust, but not heavy.

S: A much heavier, almost dark smell. It smells like roasted pines and tart lemon juice concentrate, with a bit of lime.  T: Tastes like it smells. Citrus and piney going down. It has an aftertaste that quickly recedes, but pops back now and again.  M: Very smooth, that goes down easy with a little bit of carbonation on the end.  O: The 90 minute was one of the first beers I had and back then I had hated it. I don't know if it was a change in palate (but I did like IPAs back then), or if it was just an old/skunked beer. However, I had one last night at a party and loved it, and so I saved one to review tonight. It is a great IPA, especially with its wide and yearly availability. It is quite strong, but not as hop forward as I remember. This beer is extremely well-balanced, with a neat profile.  p.s.

Great scent that lingers throughout.  Taste: Extremely well balanced. I thought I was going to be attacked by the hops, but the malt kicks in and makes for some great chemistry.  Mouthfeel: A bit slick, which for myself is off putting, but the carbonation level makes up for it and keeps it light.  Overall: I'm just starting to get into the variety of IPAs out there, and I really enjoyed this one.

S: This is where this one misses a little for me. Wanted more hops, but they take a back seat to a more malty front. I had to search for the hop scent I was looking for.  T: The theme continued here. More malt with nice hop presence taking a back seat. The finish here was the best part for me. Nice bitter taste lingers on the back of the tounge.  M: I enjoyed the mouthfeel. A little thinner than I like, but crisp with good carbonation.  O: I really enjoyed this one, but prefer the west coast citrus hop bombers over these more malty brews.

Overall a beautiful hop bomb that does not shred the taste buds.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,KTCamm,3.62,"Served on tap at the Ginger Man in South Norwalk CT.  Pours amber colored. Some foam rings around. Lighter on top. Can see through. Very faint smell, tough to pick up much. Hops if anything. All hop bitter taste - hard and long lasting. Some balance, but struggles to hold it. Juicy at first. Not sure this is better than the 60.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Novels,4.26,"One hell of an imperial IPA. Great savory taste, has an extreme hop profile that would satisfy any hop fanatic. Raisins, stone fruit, lemons on the nose.

10099,2093,KYGunner,4.24,"Orange to light amber in appearance the head was stiff and frothy.  Malt and floral hop nose create a backbone to levels of fruit. Watermelon scents are strong with touches of lemon. Brewed tea scents are created by the malts and grain to give the scent a stronger body.  Strong malts for an IPA I catch a ton of bitter hops in the aftertaste. No piney hops but strong hoppy bitterness, this is unlike most DIPAs. I really like the stronger sweet malt body as its offset by the hops.  The label speaks of ridiculous amounts of English barley and its reflected in the taste and body. More English Pale Ale character but true American DIPA feel this is a really fine beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Since I drink from the bottle, I rate the bottle's appearance and not the beer's, and there's nothing special about this bottle. It smells a little better than average, but for me one of the best things about IPA's is their smell and this one doesn't wow me. It seems fairly tame for an IPA; no ""grapefruit blast"" or whatever. I like my IPA's to taste like pine sap on steroids, but this one is fairly mild. Has a good mouthfeel with the right amount of carbonation to keep things interesting. Like I said, better than most, but IMHO, not good enough to be great.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

A deep orange, grapefruit, and apricot smell.  Taste: A real good mix of citric hops, bitterness and sweet caramel malts. The flavor I get the most is caramel malt and pine.  Mouthfeel: Full body and creamy with a little carbonation. Mellow finish.  Overall: A very balanced and drinkable double IPA. More on the malt end. A good anytime beer but maybe more of a winter beer because of its heavier body.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Hendry,3.84,"Lots of other reviews to read if you want repetitive descriptions of appearance,aroma and flavor: no offense intended to the truly knowledgable reviewers on this site. This was the first of the BA ""world-class"" rated beers that seemed simply overrated for my liking.  I realize Esquire mag rated/reviewed this brew off the charts (as blatently advertised on the pricey 4 pack), and BA also thinks quite highly of this DIPA, but for my taste, it was an out and out ""malt bomb"" with a restrained,bland hop flavor. I found this DIPA a chore to get through the 12 oz bottle with an aftertaste that reminded me of cough syrup.  Once again, super high ratings have the ability to raise expectations.There are clearly many that feel this DIPA is worthy of ultra high marks, and I'm certainly not telling other people what to enjoy or not to enjoy: it only goes to show there are different likes and dislikes for every beer. If your tastes lean toward an aggresively malty DIPA this will be a winner for you, and for those seeking complex citrus hop flavors....meh! Easily the most overrated beer for my taste so far,and a ton of choices in the $10-$11 4 pack selections.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Decent spotty fluffy bits of lacing here and there.  S: Really nice grapefruit aroma with lots of caramel to sweeten it up. Hints of tropical fruit and resinous pine. Kinda had a sweetbread type of aroma.  T: Again, lots of caramel mixing in with lots of hops. Tropical fruit is stronger here with bunches of pine. I may have been mistaken on the grapefruit, not picking up any here. The caramel in this is really wonderful - it sets it apart. Again, a sort of a sweetbread flavor mixing in with all the caramel. Maybe even get some honey in here? Very nice and strong sweet malt backbone backing up the hoppiness. The sweetness runs out in the finish and you're left with just tropical fruit, pine and resin. Fairly bitter but not overpowering. Great flavors.  M: Medium bodied, slick, a bit oily especially in the finish. Mouthcoating hop oils.  O: This is one hell of a DIPA. It's very hoppy but not overpowering and is surprisingly balanced. The sweet caramel and honey flavors in this really sets it apart. Great compliment to the bitter hop flavors and serves to accentuate them rather than fight them. Very balanced and super drinkable DIPA. One of the best balanced all-around versions you can find.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Wrigfen,4.8,"Poured great, decent head. Honey colored beer. Rich look, even richer full body taste. Poured with a nice head. While an awesome full body beer, it did not leave you feeling like you drank something heavy and did not leave you bloated allowing you to enjoy more. At 9% you get a nice little kick. This is a great beer to have with dinner or just to sit down and enjoy a few. I would be hard pressed to think of a better beer. A must for all real beer aficionados. Enjoy! I probably would drink it all the time if it was just a little lower in price but still very reasonably priced for a beer in this category of this magnitude. My first 5!!! Dogfish head Burton Barton is slightly better, but because of the affordability factor when comparing this one puts it right there too.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,GreesyFizeek,3.44,"Bottle purchased at Beers of the World in Rochester, NY.  Pours a dark orange, almost red. Almost clear. 1 inch head, strong lacing.  Smells like citrus zest, brown sugar, pine, and alcohol.  The 90 minutes of hopping provide tastes like pine needles, orange rind, and hash oil. The strong, almost overpowing malt bill brings flavors of caramel, brown sugar, maple syrup, and molasses. The malts are too strong, to be honest, and too sweet- they drown out the hops, and keep the beer from being dry.  Sticky, syrupy mouthfeel. Well carbonated.  A lot of people call this a balanced DIPA. I disagree- I think it is unbalanced towards the malt. Not enough hop presence for the strong malts.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,dpodratsky3,4.43,"12 oz bottle poured into pint glass  A: I went into this not expecting much of a head. At 9% alcohol its usually a bit thin, not much of a surprise then that the head wasn't that big. However, what film stays behind looks good. The beer is crystal clear very light orange, golden hues.  S: The smell is intoxicating. Slams you with both caramel sweetness, resin and some tropical hops all at once. I really like the way the caramel malt smells here. Sometimes its a little too over the top and stands out in a bad way. Here it works so well with the hops. It smells like its melted caramel drizzled over a delicious loaf of bread. The hops are there but blend so well into the malt its almost seamless. I can't tell if i really smell fruity hops or if its just the sweetness from the malt. Definitely resiny hops.  T: Taste is still really good, but doesn't quite live up to the hype of the aroma. That delicious bread sweetness is a little too dominated by the hops. It makes the taste a little more one dimensional than the aroma. Piney, resiny hops are super dominant. Huge bitter punch. It does have flavor though. Some DIPAs forgo flavor for IBU's this manages to do both.  M: Carbonation is fairly high, accentuates the hop sting but helps to clean the palate of all the intense flavors. So, well done. Body is light, which is a huge part in why this beer is so good. That sweetness that makes the aroma/taste good would be ruined if the beer was heavy.  O: An excellent DIPA. There is always room for improvement, but this beer is one of the best examples of the style. It's no surprise that its one of the most popular DIPAs.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I think I like it better now, after I have grown a couple of specific taste buds for hoppier brews. I like the taste, I like the abv, I like the 12oz bottle (bombers are really becoming a drag when I want to try something different, ya know?), but it has an almost amateurish taste to it. not a 'refined' sweetness, but a 'forced' sweetness. either way, i'll leave the marks I gave it originally.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Hop flavor and oils are full, round and fulfilling as they surround the exceptional malt base. There are so many flavor dimensions in each sip, it simply has to be sampled to understand. I find that it's okay to sip this slowly, but occasionally to enjoy a healthy mouth-full.  Either way, here's what I got. Full malt flavor, check. Hops that satisfy, check.

Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Spigelu Dogfish head IPA glass.  A- Pours a deep reddish amber (coppery crimson) with a fat 2 finger slightly off white head. Leaves an ample amount of lacing along the sides of the glass. Good head retention.  S- Sweet and fruity with a pronounced malt backbone. The barley is incredilby prominent in the finish. There are also some strong caramel notes and what I detect to be some (albeit incredibly faint) strawberry notes.  T- Sweet fruity flavors from the hops and delicious sweet bready caramel flavors from the malts. The flavor is complex and yet simple at the same time. There is a very malty finish from the barley with some toasty caramel and very slight coffee notes from the malts, as awell as just the slightest bit of a bitter tinge right at the very end, Despite the great amount of malty sweetness there is actually a nice bitter aftertaste that is left behind.  M- The body is on the heavier side of medium. carbonated yet smooth.  O- With all the crazy hype for this beer, I have to admit that on my first try I found it to be a bit overwhelming (only slightly though). That being said, this is still a fantastic beer. MUCH MUCH more malty than I had expected it to be. An incredibly drinkable and hard to put down malt forward DIPA.

S: Not extremely hoppy, but there is a really nice fruit component that might be best described as grapefruit meets maraschino cherries.  T: Nice bitter slap of the tongue on the front end, a bit of candy-coated booze, some candi sugar, and another bitter slap by some citrus in the mid-late palate.  M: Bitter, but that bitterness wasn't gum removing by any stretch. It had a nice, sweet taper to it that was quite good. Some splotchy lacing left on the glass and some inviting lingering left in the mouth.  O: One of the best East Coast DIPAs on the market. Always a pleasure.

Smell - Pungent caramel malt complexity highlights the aroma. Hops take a backseat, but come across as floral and a touch of pine.  Taste - Strong malt complexity upfront - caramel and bread smack you in the mouth and don't hold back. Hops pop up mid-taste and are floral, with a slight hint of pine. Finish is well-balanced and clean, allowing for drink after drink; almost quaffable.  Mouthfeel - Medium to full body, with moderate carbonation. Creamy, smooth and entirely drinkable.  Overall - I really love this beer. Easily my favorite DFH beer to date. I'd love to try one that's less than a month old, because 3 months in, I feel like this one has maybe lost a bit of it's hop sheen.

Appearance: 90 Minute looks...normal. Nothing too special about the appearance. Light and unoriginal.  Smell: Hops, fruit notes, but not too strong. Fairly subdued, though, and the scents are not prominent enough to meet the hype.  Taste: Light fruit, light hops. I would offer this to my BMC friends who have never tried a craft brew; however, I don't think Dogfish Head's acclaimed 90 Minute IPA would like that remark. Honestly, I'm not impressed by the taste. It's decent, but the taste doesn't live up to the reputation.  Mouthfeel: Not unpleasant, but not remarkable. To be short, I do not pick up any remarkable mouthfeel aspects of the beer.  Overall: I hate to criticize, but I'm disappointed by 90 Minute IPA. It's not a bad beer, and I would recommend it to my BMC-exclusive friends; yet, as a craft beer geek, I'm not exactly impressed by the beer's characteristics.

Yes there are hops, but I feel like the malt character of this beer steals the show. It's sweet, rich caramel and fresh baked biscuits all day long. The hops dart playfully in and out but are never rude or overbearing. The alcohol only shows up as the faintest tingle in the throat. It doesn't get much better than this.

I would say that the hops are more present in the 60 minute but that isn't to say that the 90 minute doesn't have it's fair share. The malt is way more pronounced in this beer. Very drinkable at 9.0% and I can see why this is so highly rated. Would definitely buy this again.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,raynmoon,4.2,"bottled 11/28/12  Not perfectly fresh, but 2 months is still just fine.  Moderate lacing, no alcohol legs really, surprising. It's a super rich orange color. Perfect looking. A touch of haze would make it even prettier, but it is so clear and pretty!  smells like super rich toasty malts, with a touch of orange zest in there. Little hop bitterness, but that can be blamed a little on the age. Still smells tasty.  A big beer this is. It's malt backbone makes itself very present throughout. I get a nice amount of hop bitterness and a touch of tangerine. This is more like an American Strong Ale than an IPA, but still very balanced and smooth. It leaves a distinct roasty malt character on your breath, like you had just eaten some caramel malts yourself.  Light carbonation, no tingling from the bubbles, just soft and creamy. It's roasty, bitter and creamy quality would suggest this is an Imperial Stout.  Maybe they should amp up the chocolate malt and make it one.  Seems slightly confused from the style, or perhaps I've been drinking too much Lagunitas. I tend to like a slightly lighter, tropical body on my favorite IPA's. Still a classic though. Nothing to complain about; all good.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,KingEdward,1.86,"Malt and no hop, more like a stong ale than a ipa. This is not good, i have no plans of ever drinking this again. Its a malt bomb that needs about another 50ibus at least in order to taste like an ipa.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,HabiMendes,4.31,"Superb IPA, with an exquisite amber appearance, calls your attention right away. The aroma, of course, is exuberantly hoppy, with a background resin character. The taste is fantastic. I note that, in some other styles, I have concerns about the over-presence of hops. Here, given the style, I was less concerned, but still skeptic.  However, the hop exuberance was very suited to other aspects of the beer. The taste was not dry, and the vigorous hoppy character captures your taste buds really fast. With the kind of food I had (Mexican-style and, later, a Gorgonzola cheese), it was perfect. Excellent tasting.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

It has a pretty clean, dry aftertaste.  Overall it is a great beer. It is well balanced, can't find anything to complain about.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

This IIPA poured a hazy golden color, produced a nice thick white head, retention was great, and it left good amount of lace on the glass. The Aroma of the ale consisted of fresh pine needles, apples and herbal notes. Full bodied, this IIPA has a great malted grain base, ample amount of oily, piney hop flavor, there are some notes of fresh pressed apple juice. The mouthfeel of this IIPA is very smooth and silky... The bitter hop flavor sticks from start to finish. One of my favorite IPA's- Can't wait to sample some of Dogfish's other IPA's.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,--Dom--,4.67,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter. Pours a crystal clear honey color. Barely any head even with a hard pour. Smells of strong citrus, pine, resiny, hop goodness.  The taste of this beer is amazing. Tons of flavor. Despite the 90 IBU's for me anyway, there is no unpleasant hop punch. You get the full flavor right off the bat, but it's such a good flavor. Citrus and pine to start. You can taste the alcohol but I like it. Perfectly sweet enough to balance the hop, but not malty enough to be roasty. On the back end, less sweet, melting into a slightly more bitter grapefruit. It is an exquisite IPA. I can only think of one IPA I've had that is better and it is much less available and much more expensive.  Overall it may be my favorite IPA, and definitely in my top 10 beers.

Then there is the backlash to the hype, and then the backlash to the backlash. This beer has gone from one of the most under-rated in the world, to one of the most over-rated, and has now settled in nicely to where it should have always been: a phenomenally drinkable, flavorful, and distinctly aromatic beer that is palatable for even the most novice IPA lovers. Way back in the day I fell in love with Imperials once the flashy, sexy 90-minute hit my virgin lips. Sure, I've had other love affairs with plenty of other DIPAs since then, and I have 90 less and less frequently, but don't let anybody tell you differently: the thrill is still there everytime I crack a new one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,RichD,4.45,"Poured this bad boy into my snifter.  A: Pours a deep golden orangey yellow. Pretty good size white/off-white head.  S: Smells of pure hoppage. The piney, earthy goodness. However, it seemed to be quite muted. Nothing that screams 90 IBUs.  T: I can't believe this is 90 IBUs. I was totally expecting a hoppy punch in the face and I did not get that. Instead I do get the piney, grassy, earthy goodness, but it's a subtle taste. This is pretty impressive. I had the 60 minute a few weeks back and it seemed to be a lot more bitter and in-your-face. There's a light bitterness that tapers of into nothing. I believe that the generous amount of malts in this beer help to control the bitterness which ultimately makes this a a really great IPA.  M: A pretty medium mouthfeel. A moderate level of carbonation which also helps to offset the bitterness. Also, the 9% ABV is very well hidden. The first thing I thought to myself when I tasted this was, wow, I can't believe this is 9%.  Overall: This is a very solid IPA. Seeing that it's classified as a double IPA, I can't help but think that this is definitely a more malty and less bitter, but really delicious brew. Dogfish Head did a great job with this one and I can definitely see myself picking up more of this in the future. Great job guys!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

There are notes of grassy, piney and earthy hops along with some citrus notes. There is a slightly sweet smell to it along with toffee and caramel malt notes.  The taste is also kind of subtle. There is the brief hop burst up front with grassy, piney hop notes some slight citrus sweetness and it has caramel malt notes near the back. Very, very balanced and it finishes very dry and pretty bitter although the sweetness helps.  The body is medium and there is a creamy mouthfeel. Can't taste or smell any alcohol.  Not a bad beer at all, but I prefer my Imperial IPAs to be more aggressive and less malty.

Finish was dry and malty. Flavor is immensely fruity in the front and middle. Also got floral notes in the front.

10099,2093,barczar,4.2,"Reviewing 60, 75, and 90 minute side-by-side.  Pours a slightly hazed golden caramel color, substantially darker than the 75 minute. A soft, pillowy half inch cream head dissipates quickly in comparison, leaving small lacing around the rim.  Caramel malts are hugely dominant in the aroma in comparison with the 60 and 75. There's a bready sweetness and a boozy character that initially mask the hops. At the back of the nose, though, grapefruit, pine, earthiness, and fresh cut grass are detectable. As it warms, the hops become more pronounced. Dank, skunky notes emerge.  Flavor is much sweeter and boozier than the 60 and 75. Caramel malt sweetness is present throughout the profile. Dank hops, along with citrus notes of grapefruit and tangerine, underlie the malt character. The hop flavors linger into the finish more so than in the 60 and 75, as well. The finish reprises a bit of the bready malt character, and there's more bitterness. As it warms, the citrus really emerges and shows that the 90 really does have more hop character.  Body is fairly thick and slightly syrupy, with carbonation significantly lower than the 60 and 75. There's a lot more alcohol warmth.  Overall, the balance is more difficult to figure out in this brew. Extreme in both malt and hop character, as a dipa should be. Very sweet in comparison to the other two, but still enough hops to give the palate a proper beating.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,AmitC,4.5,"There is not much to review this. Big brother of 60 minute. Big in bitterness, aroma, alcohol and body.  Just making minor changes to my 60 Min review.  Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a large snifter.  Golden color. Very very clear appearance. Finger thick head of white color. Stands as a thin disc. Excellent lacing. Good number of bubbles.  Aroma: Piney hops with a lot of herbal weed presence. Smells a lot like wild weeds in the jungle and that is its point of distinction. If you give this to some beer novice, i am sure he won't drink it just after smelling it. I like the aroma. It is inviting, one-of-a-kind and intoxicating at the same time. Not a very strong aroma but very subtle and complex. You know, it could be any weed, but it is hops.  Taste: Malts upfront and bitter afterwards. Aftertaste is bitter in a distinct way. It really is a different brew. Very unlike any other IPA that i have tried so far, and i have tried quite a few. Not a lot of bitterness but for an AIPA it is just adequate. Dry bitter finish.  Mouth feel: Medium feel. Hop derived astringency that is mild for an hop lover and would be unbearable for a hopophobiac (that is a term i just coined). Moderate carbonation.

The balance makes this memorable.   O. I have experimented with many DIPA since the last time I had a 90 minute, this is a really great hoppy, yet balanced DIPA, the category has those that wreck the palette and those that are drinkable yet clearly hopped up, this is in the not palette wrecking category.

Tons and tons of flavor here; sweet at the front slowly blending to the lingering bitterness of the hops.  Overall:  This is one of my absolute favorite beers across the board. The fantastic taste profile and supreme mouthfeel make this good for so many different occasions: perfect amount of sweet, great texture, and hops for daysss. I cannot recommend this enough; this is a must try for anyone who loves hops and loves IPAs.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Beautiful hazy orange color. Aromas of malt and spice are not immediately noticeable, however, but come through as 90 minute sits for a bit. Light caramel and a bready smell are also present. All aromas become more prominent and enjoyable as I drink the beer. Taste is very balanced, with spices, sweetness, hops and malt all noticeable, no single characteristic dominates. Dry on the end, with spice aftertaste perfect for this early November weather. Perhaps a bit of citrus, orange/grapefruit, on the end as well. Mouthfeel is balanced, very nicely, with medium carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall this is a wonderful beer. Have not had it since last March or so, but recall fond memories of finishing off a case of 90 minute over the holidays last year with my brother and father.

10099,2093,BigCheese,3.59,"Bottled on 9/6/12 so its about 7 weeks old, pretty good.  A: Decent sized white head. Clear bronze color. Head dies down pretty quick and leaves some spots of foam on glass.  S: Grapefruit and pine hops off the bat, then a big hint of molasses and brown sugar. Smells really good actually.  T: Off the bat a mix of pine and biscuity/toasted bread malt. The bitterness is definitely there but not sure about the ""hoppyness"". The malt profile is interesting, nutty, woody, and a bit spicey (maybe boozy). Finish is pine cones and lemon grass with some floral notes.. BItterness doesnt really come through until the end. pretty well balanced overall.  M: Heavy/Full body. More syrupy than creamy, carbonation low. Not sessionable but I could probably do 3 with snacks.  O: Not sure I'd consider this a DIPA although its quite bitter. Maybe an Imperial Amber or Barleywine? The hop aroma is there, and the bitterness is there, but the hop flavor is lacking, could use more late boil hops. Despite its ""flaws"" its still quite tastey and well balanced.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,MrBoh,4.7,"This has long been one of my favorite IPAs (in my top three where I have had trouble really saying which one is better), and one of my favorite beers overall. I have had a hundred or so beers I had never had before since my last 90. So, anxious to see how it stacks up now. Pulled from fridge and let it warm up to the recommended temperature, before pouring the 12oz bottle into my DFH signature snifter.  a- Pours a dark caramely color, 1in+ of head, with a denser head in the center. Head is slightly off-white. The lacing in this beer is ridiculous. Every sip leaves some. Of course some drops, but I still see a lot there, no matter how long I leave it sit. A bit of citrusy alcohol after a while.  s- A definite piney and citrusy aroma. A strong malt backbone scent, with some sweetness on the end. I think it is supposed to smell like grapefruit, but it reminds me more of tangerine. Sweet malty character starts to dominate after a minute. As it sits longer, you do get some alcohol taste.  t- Oh, the taste. Not as hoppy as I remember. Maybe this bottle is too old (that's one thing I miss about the east coast, fresh DFH). A good bit of malty sweetness on the front, a bittery pine in the middle, leading way to a bittery sweet roasted malt charact.er Not dark roasted like a stout, but still a nice roasted character (especially for a beer that apparently uses such a little amount of specialty malt). A definite spicyness starting to make its way in, especially as it sits out longer. Not a whole lot of complexity here, which I think is just right for an American IPA.  m- This is a very crisp beer. honestly, from all my experiences with it, it always seems crisp. Whether very cold, or room temperature. For being 90IBUs its quite refreshing, the sweetness helps this. Very clean.  o- This beer is not as good as I remember. I think it could be due to the lack of freshness. Hoppy beers just usually can't stand up to the aging. Or maybe my palate has just changed. I also prefer a good bit of alcohol taste on big beers, which this did not really have until near its finish for me. Regardless, still one of my favorite beers, and favorite IPAs of course. Has a good bit of sweetness and a strong malt backbone to balance, but the hops are still able to stand out (although not as much as I remember).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,KKB,4.75,"A – A wonderful light caramel/tangerine amber with honey colored accents and a beautiful creamy off white head resting on top for the length of the beer leaving wonderful lacing down the sides. This is a rather beautiful beer.  S – What a more delightful nose. My good glory be to betsy george Washington carver. That is powerful and aromatic and enticing. It has loads of wonderful citric hops, a really nice sweet caramel malty element to it, and some orange and grapefruit in there as well.  T – The taste is easily the best part. You know, when I was writing about the 120 minute IPA I said that it was incomparable to the 90 or 60 minute IPAs. But now I take that back, you can definitely see how the 90 min IPA would lead into the 120 min IPA. But the 90 min IPA is better. The flavors are more reigned in, and the lesser alcohol content lets you truly explore them. This beer relies almost equally upon the hops and the malt, so that there is a combination of delightful fresh pine sappy bitterness and playing off of it is a sumptuous caramel sweetness provided by the malted barley; and then there is a playful lark of fruit that intermingles betwixt the two, providing that nice orange/citrus element. The alcohol is noticed, however it contributes to the beer as opposed to detracts from it.  M – The mouthfeel is gorgeous, just the right amount of carbonation keeps this from being bogged down, it’s juicy and supremely drinkable on the plate and ends with a nice dry crisp finish. Lovely.  O – I make no bones about the 90 min IPA—it is one of my favorite beers. I love everything about this beer from head to toe and I think that it is just so well orchestrated and such a treat to imbibe. Thank you DFH for knocking this one out of the park.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Brandywine,4.47,"Appearance: Clear orange with a fingers worth of white head. Dissipated pretty quickly. Noticeable alcohol legs. Smell: grapefruit, sweet orange, pineapple, mango, peach, subtle touch of resin. Lots of sweet malt. Taste: Follows the nose with dominant grapefruit and orange notes. Extremely well balanced between the bitter hops and the sweet malt. This IPA is all about the tropical fruit notes. Overall: One of the best balanced IPA's I've had.

Same tastes as the smells.. Nutty, caramel, sweet medium body, medium carbonation, creamy mouthfeel. A PERFECT year round ipa.

It's like 120 minute is in my 90 minute bottle.

10099,2093,GMB,4,"Dogfish Head's 90 Minute IPA pours an amber body that is paler than expected. A standard pour produces very little by way of foam. Still, the thin ivory ring that does appear in my glass settles into a beautiful pattern atop the beer's body. This I attribute to the hop-oils. I have an ambivalent reaction to the carbonation. No streams of bubbles are visible; rather, one finds an attractive amount of bubbles that slowly make their way towards the top. On the other hand, the bubbles themselves are slightly larger than I like; I expect this beer to be a bit sharp on the tongue.  The nose foregrounds an appealing mixture of citral hop aromas, alcohol and malt. Light caramel and butterscotch are suggested beneath aromas of raisins, sweet grapefruit, and apricots.  The first sip is chewier and gentler on the palate than I had guessed. A whirl around the tongue produces the kind of creamy, viscous froth I expected to see when I poured it.  This beer's flavors take longer to develop on the palate than most Double IPAs. Up front is the rich caramel from the malt. There follows a quick burst of citral hops, which are immediately engaged by the flavor of alcohol. Hoppy bitterness is at first masked by the interplay by the aforementioned flavors. But as the bitterness gradually builds on the palate, it completes the illusion of grapefruit that was first suggested by the beer's nose and then momentarily glimpsed in that initial burst of citral hops.  The beer has a long, sophisticated hang in which resinous hoppy flavors, bitterness, alcohol, and a lot of malt take turns on the palate. Sweet butterscotch, fresh pine, grapefruit, raisins, sweet and peaty whiskey all make appearances. At its best, the taste of this beer is superb.  But as I slowly made my way through the bottle, I became increasingly aware that the alcohol is less integrated than it should be. Perhaps more aggressive hopping would give it something to complement. I noted in the first sip that it got in the way of other flavors. By the middle of the glass, it appears clumsy. By the last few sips it verges on becoming overbearing.  Dogfish Head's 90 Minute IPA is a delicious Double IPA that offers a unique, memorable flavor profile. Unfortunately, it also suffers to some extent from a lack of balance.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,ChrisH1024,4.45,"Overall, the beer was a fantastic experience of flavor and the bitterness I like in an IPA.  Medium pour into a Pint. It poured a hazy blonde at first and cleared up into a copper color with a little haziness to it. Very good lacing down the glass.  The smell comprised of an almost caramelized maltiness to it, with some nice citrus and floral scents to back it up.  It definitely tasted more full than it looked with a nice caramel beginning and a nice refreshing blast of hops after.  Overall, a very delicious beer that I can drink at any point of the year.

O: Sort of like their 60 minute IPA, I feel like their focus is too much on malts and not on hops. Neither the 60 or 90 minute are balanced properly. I would never believe this was 90 IBUs because it is so sweet. It makes them unique IPAs, but they seem a bit sickening to drink more than one or two in a sitting.

It just happens to fall in that hard-to-reach spot that I personally like... where the beer has body and boldness without turning into a super bitter hop-fest.

Honestly, I don't think the beer tastes much like it smells, but that really doesn't even matter with this one.  Taste/feel: Has to be the most interesting IPA I've had up to this point. It's certainly loaded with hops, but it also has -- as the bottle puts it -- a ridiculous amount of barley. I absolutely love it. It's hop heavy up front and in the smell, but the malts come through on the finish. I love it. There's also a bit of warmth as well, making this a perfect Autumn beer. The feel of this one bothers me a tad, though. The whole beer itself is legendary, but I almost feel this beer to be a bit too syrupy to have more than one in a sitting.

With this beer being so crystal clear the carbonation is visible as tiny bubbles stream up to the surface. I love the appearance of this beer. Perfection!  Smell: There is pine hop, floral hop, citrus hops and a malty and bread like aroma. Toasted malts mixed with super sweet caramel invite more sniffs.  Taste: Starts out with the sweet caramel and toasted malts and this is followed by an increasing bitterness that hits you when you don't expect it. The initial sweetness took me by surprise and I think therefore the bitter notes snuck up on me. The pine and resin notes hit mid to back palate and stay throughout the swallow and into the aftertaste. Stunning!  Mouthfeel: Just an amazingly smooth beer. It is medium bodied that seems sticky. Carbonation is there to some degree and in perfect balance for this beer.  Overall: The absolute easiest DIPA I've had to date.

Smell - Chocolate, Citrus Hops, Caramel, and Malts. The smell comes off as a bit ""warm"", if you will. It's malty but it's sweetness is not too overpowering. In other words, it smells just like what a Imperial IPA should smell like.  Taste - Wow, this one packs a strong hop punch! Strong Citrus hops, sweet caramel, toffee, chocolate and malts. Judging by the aroma, I never would've guessed the hops would've been this strong. Flavor is outstanding, and the other flavor notes help keep the flavor from being too one sided.

All sorts of things are going on here - pines, pinecones, herbs, spices, and floral tones nail you up front. As it warms in your mouth, out comes the earthy esters, grapefruit, orange zest, and sweet malt and yeast on the very back of the tongue. The alcohol provides a nice warming sensation without being overbearing. The mouth is a bit thick and chewy, leaving a sticky feeling in the mouth with a bit of a snap on the tip of your tongue from the carbonation.  One of the best ""easy-to-find-year-round"" DIPAs.

T: Lots of toasted malt, caramel, sugar, coffee. Hop flavor is pretty subdued.  M: Sugary, medium carbonation. 9% alcohol is well-hidden.  O: Decent IIPA, especially considering the wide availability of it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,hopsolutely,4.2,"Definitely a benchmark beer!  Pours a cloudy orange amber with a moderate head that quickly dissipates, but decent residual lacing. Brilliant aroma is a nice balance of tropical fruits and ""c"" hops braced with a robust malt backbone. This balance follows into the taste, which starts with the full hop spectrum crossing every aspect of the palate, but with an underlying caramelized malt sweetness that takes any potential edges off. Citrus, mango, guava, papaya, pineapple - pretty much all forms of tropical loveliness are represented. The finish is pleasantly bitter and lingers for a decent length of time (without destroying anything).  A beer I've enjoyed several times before, but never while within reach of a computer. It remains a benchmark beer to which I will return whenever a 9% ABV beverage is appropriate!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,intensify,4.16,"From bottle, to my favorite snifter. Poured a rough 1 finger head with medium, to fast retention. Cloudy and hazy amber looks beautiful. Potent piney presence as well as a touch of biscuit and some earthyness. I wouldn't consider this beer hoppy one bit.Yes the hops are present, but the caramel and maltyness just even things out so nicely.Mostly sweet, but a touch of bitterness. Can you say juicy? Medium to light mouthfeel. Overall its a tasty brew which the booze hardly, if even, sticks out. Very smooth and crisp. Doesnt get much better then this. This is definately a well balance DIPA.

10099,2093,Beelzebeer,4.63,"12oz bottle, brewed April 23/12, making it 5 months old. Served in tulip.  A - Generous creamy head, nice lacing, golden body  S - Pine, resiny, mild fruit. The age has taken some of the aromatics away, but still a delight  T - Oh yeah. Nice malt off the top, giving way to pine hops, rounded nicely in it's age. I remember it to be a little more robust in its youth, but even a little older, it's still great. The bitter has been replaced with more melding of the malt/hop. The alcohol I also remember being more present but has faded a little quite nicely.  M - Perfect. Medium-low carbonation, without being flat. Feels very ""alive"". Good amount of sugars in it still, giving a hefty (for the style) weight while still going down extremely well.  O - I wish I lived in the states so this could be a regular option.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Absolutely superb! 5/5  S - Balanced smell with a good malty caramelized sweetness and a strong hoppy aroma (piney, herbal, citrusy and a bit floral). 4.5/5  T - Malt upfront as expected. I pick out dry apricots, caramel, and a hint of liquorice that lingers. Then hop comes ahead with a good herbal/citrusy character. A solid spiciness finishes the experience and lingers very well. 5/5  M - Medium-full body. Carbonation is spot on, making this beer extremely smooth. An astringent feel shows up with the hoppy flavors, kicking you tongue in an interesting manner. Semi-dry finish with moderate notes of alcohol. 4.5/5  O - Amazing beer, definitely a classic Imperial IPA with a massive hoppy character and very interesting and complex flavors. The drinkability is astonishing considering the ABV... 12oz is just not enough!!! 4.5/5",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,stlunatic15,4.8,"Along with many other reviewers, I've also been drinking this for years, and have yet to review it. So here it goes:  A - Beautiful, deep golden-copper color. Elegant lacing, with a thin white head.  S - Caramel, grape, maple, and a slight hint of oak.  T - Notes of grapefruit, dark berries, hops, and strong malt. Slight booze flavor as well. Extremely complex.  M - Perfect carbonation. Medium bodied - not too thick but not overly thin either (very well balanced IPA). Fairly smooth finish.  O - I love this beer so much because it simply stands out from your stereotypical Imperial IPA. DFH does a magnificent job when it comes to collaborating various ingredients and flavors, making very complex, yet different beers, while still maintaining the particular style of each beer (if that makes sense).

I feel this is one of the best IPAs out there; it looks great, has a solid head, smells wonderful, has a smooth consistent flavor with no odd aftertaste or quirks as you're raising the glass/bottle for the next gulp.  I also like the fact I can get it for slightly under retail at the brewery and, since it's in tax-free Delaware, not pay any taxes on the case or two I get when I'm nearby. Very nice!  A great beer; I've never had a bad one from a tap or in a bottle.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

It has good head retention with nice lacing. This beer has legs. Upfront I smell malt, followed by pine, floral and grapefruit notes. It is very sweet. In order to get a beer this sweet at such a high abv, there has to be a ton of grain in this beer. There is a average amount of hop bitterness, mostly in the back end. I get some fusels near the end as well. The mouthfeel is adequate with a good amount of carbonation for this style.  Overall this is a decent beer, but not the best IPA in the Country. For a bottle just under three months old, there isn't a significant amount of hop flavor or aroma. It is also cloyingly sweet.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,JamesMN,4.65,"Appearance: Dark straw/copper color with a soapy off-white head. Pretty much the same as their 60 Minute. Nice carbonation bubbles floating upwards.  Aroma: Lots of caramel malt and some bready notes with a piney hop presence. Not quite as aromatic as I expected but still smells great.  Taste: From beginning to end you get a great bitter hop bite. It's slightly spicy and piney with a dash of sweet hop flavor that impacts a real nice bitterness. Evenly matched with all those hops is a solid malt body. Caramel, bread, and some hints of roasted malt create a perfect structure for the hops to stand on. The 9% abv is so well hidden it has to be tasted to be believed. There is a slight warmth in the throat but that just adds to the enjoyment.  Mouthfeel: Damn near perfect. Medium bodied and drinkable. Very smooth with a nice level of effervescence.  Final Thoughts: If I could get DFH where I lived then this one would always be in my fridge. It would probably pair really well with most meaty dishes and works really well on it's own.

T: definitely citrus tasting, very intense, hoppy taste which actually overpowered it a little and I couldnt get a lot of the flavor but could still taste bits of orange, grapefruit, etc.  M: Can still taste that flavor, has a good mouthfeel.

10099,2093,davecavemaster,4.35,"Here's the next level IPA that Dogfish Head offers after the 60 minute IPA, although this brew predates the 60 & 120 versions in production. This beer has been voted ""Best Beer In America"" three different years.  The beer pours with a thick creamy off-white head. It's one of those heads that you can stick your finger in, and the hole stays there... The color is a very clear golden orange, with a steady stream of tiny bubbles that stream up from the bottom/center of the glass.  The smell is intense. You definitely get your hops, but there are also strong aromas of grapefruit and pine. Behind that, you also get a nose of toasty malt, something I'm not used to smelling in most IPAs.  The taste certainly follows the nose, big grapefruit and pine flavors. Also with this brew, there is an excellent balance to the hops, so you get some malty flavors as well as some honey.  This 90 minute has a great presence in your mouth. There is a heaviness to this brew that just coats your entire mouth in the multiple flavors going on. Not a lot of carbonation, just the swirling of the flavors. You can also feel the fact that this beer is a 9%...  What a beer! There are so many flavors and smells going on here, a truly great IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,superspak,4.2,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 6/25/2012. Pours fairly crystal clear golden orange color with a nice 2 finger dense cream colored head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some nice foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, orange rind, herbal, floral, pine, caramel, biscuit, mango, peach, toast, and earthiness. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good strength and complexity. Taste of big grapefruit, orange zest, pine, herbal, floral, caramel, toast, biscuit, peach, mango, and earthy spiciness. Good amount of smooth and spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, caramel, biscuit, toast, nuttiness, pine, peach, mango, and light herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance of pronounced caramel and toasty malt sweetness, with smoothly bitter hop flavors; very good flavor complexity and balance as well. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a pretty creamy, slick, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent DIPA. The English two row adds a nice unique dimension to the flavor profile; and it has a very smooth balance of hoppiness with the malt profile.

10099,2093,kdb150,4.3,"Most recent poured from a bottle at fridge temps into a generic chalice, allowed to warm a bit over the course of consumption up to this point.  A - Pours orange/amber with an impressive 2 fingers of head, that recede to a thick ring and thin coating. Great lacing. Looks good.  S - Lots of delicious grapefruit, with honey and caramel lurking in the background. Smells good!  T - Follows the nose, and then some. Wonderful grapefruit hoppiness, balanced by significant malt presence. Caramel malts and possibly a bit of honey present, the maltiness provides excellent balance for this well-hopped ale. This is right up there with the best IPAs, miles ahead of most DIPAs which are pure bitter hop bombs. DFH went for more balance and complexity with this one, and it really comes through in the flavor. Delicious.  M - Good carb, a bit syrupy, but the syrupy feel delivers an excellent aftertaste, with lingering hop flavors that never turn bitter or sour. Fits perfectly with what they were going for.  O - This is a far better balanced IPA experience than the vast majority of DIPAs out there. Manages to deliver a ton of hop flavor, without being the cloyingly bitter hop bomb that most DIPAs seem to be. This is right at the top of the list, as it manages to be a complex, full-bodied ale while still having a ton of hop flavor. It's nice to have a DIPA that realizes there should be more to a beer than just bitterness.

S- bright citrus and pine hops, booze, herbal, apricot, bready yeasty malts.  T- big hops kick to the mouth right off, citrus, pine, herbal, hop oils. Orange peel and sweet melon, followed by a bready, cake-like malt that provides a solid backbone. The booze is definitely noticable but is warming and not overbearing. Finishes somewhat dry with a nice hops linger.  M- medium-heavy bodied with medium carbonation. Thick and silky palate and goes down smooth.  O- a perfect example of an Imperial IPA. Hops dominate the palate, but the sweet bready malts compliments so well and creates a great balance. A solid beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Great lacing on the side of the glass, looks absolutely delectable.  Smells very malty, more so than your traditional IPA. A sweet caramel smell hits the nose balanced nicely by the floral hop aroma.

The deep golden body and frothy white head look nice and the fruity, hoppy blast deliver as an IIPA should, but it's that silky smooth sip that makes this one extra nice.

M: Medium to heavy bodied with moderate carbonation. Silky smooth and slightly warm going down.  O: The head and lacing on this beer was phenomenal.

S: Hoppy fresh with some grapefruit, caramel malts, maple syrup and lime. The alcohol is present at the end.  T: Lots of caramel malts up front. Then a lot of orange peel, grapefruit, honeydew melon, lime and a touch of maple syrup at the end. There is also a very nice and clean bitterness and some earthy tones. The alcohol is warming but does not dominate the other flavours. After a few sips I find a long lasting honeydew melon taste.  M: Medium to full body with medium carbonation. Very smooth and fine. The alcohol makes it a bit oily. It feels well balanced.  O: A great beer! I had high expectations on this one and it really delivered.

10099,2093,ThomasMetal75,4.02,"A- Nice Copper color with a frothy, suddy, head that dies to a one finger lace around the glass.  S- The smell was noticeable right when the cap came off the bottle. Smells very dank and hoppy. Beer smells super fresh. Hemp, citrusy hops, malty scent! There are undertones of pine as well. Little bit of bready-ness perhaps to the malt? Alcohol is resent at the end of the nose. Very complex nose overall. Smells inviting for sure!  T- Hops hit yeah like a ton of bricks, but with a slightly sweet malty character! VERY BITTER!!!! Resiny and oily as well! It has an overall citrusy hop taste. It doesn't taste like a west-coast IPA. I don't really get tropical fruits like apricots or mango. Seems just like the classic grapefruit IPA flavor here. Just like in the scent, there are undertones of piney hop flavors as well. The alcohol isn't the central flavor here, but there is a slight warming presence to remind you you're drinking a double IPA! The finish coats the back of the mouth with an oily feel, hop resinous feeling before slowly drying out. REAL NICE!!!  M- Body is medium to full to say the least. It leaves a very oily, sticky feel in the mouth. Very juicy! This is not something I could have more than one of during the course of a night since the ABV is this high and palate would just be ruined from anything else I may want to drink. This is quite different than most IPA's I've ever had!!!  This is not the best IPA I've ever had, but it's damn good nontheless. Hits you like ton of bricks and never lets go.

Clear with a great amount of carbonation bubbles for the style.  S – A big sweet caramel and toasty malt presence with a generous helping of hops with mostly floral and pine aromas, along with a nice undercurrent of grapefruit and peach.  T – Starts off sweet with caramel malts, honey, and peach flavors and steadily builds to a bitter crescendo with pine and floral hop notes with a touch of grapefruit. Very well balanced and very tasty.  F – Medium-bodied with good carbonation, a chewy and sticky mouthfeel, and a dry and bitter finish. Both fruity sweetness and floral hop bitterness linger for a great amount of time. A little bit of a throat-warming sensation from the alcohol appears at the finish.  O – This is a terrific DIPA and hands-down my favorite beer from DFH. It’s great across the board, but the thing that impresses me the most is how balanced the beer is between the sweet malt and bitter hops while still being bitter enough to please the biggest hop heads. Extremely drinkable. The fact that it’s widely available and relatively cheap is just icing on the cake. Great beer from DFH.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,TBoneJones,4.28,"This is the beer that introduced me to a world i never knew (craft beer as a whole) ever since I, for no reason other than curiosity (well maybe it was the Esquire review on the colorful 4-pack), purchased some one day around 4 years ago. Every time I've poured this (it's been many an occasion now) it's been a brief head that settles quickly, with a thin lacing. The first time i tried this I didn't like it I thought. Yet I was still somehow intrigued by it...Long story short, it turned out it was because I had no prior beer experience other than low abv. mass-made swill from my college years. The smell (due to its subtlety) was never what did it for me with this now go-to DIPA. A burnt malty grapefruit sensation upon tasting this. Boozy then smoothed out by a terrific malt backbone. Although a heavy hitter, I could easily have 2 in a row and they both go down ever so smoothly due to the mouthfeel alone. While my taste buds easily prefer several others of this style, this one will always be in regular rotation because it's just unique. There is a caramel aspect to it, syrupy, not as outright hoppy as what I prefer. But in the end it's got it's own complex character I seem to revisit with regularity.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,dontpanic5,4.27,"The appearance is a amber-red body with plentiful carbonation below a sizable white head. Good retention. The smell is strongly fruity with hops. It's a strong beer, lots of hops but it goes down fairly easy. You can tell it's a hard hitter in the alcohol department but it hides the booziness well. Mouthfeel is smooth if a little overwhelming. Certainly lives up to its reputation.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,PeterM,4.15,"Rich amber with light creamy 1 finger head that disappeared fairly quickly, leaving only minimal lacing. The aroma is sharp and piney - but in the best possible way, implying good things ahead. Alcohol is also evident in the smell. Mouthfeel is oh so smooth, slightly carbonated, with citrus, malt, and hop balance that puts it into the category of excellent imperial ipa's. One if my favorite ipa's with a lingering bitterness that reminds you how good it is.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

A generous amount of carbonation bubbles rise throughout.  A rich piney aroma permeated by a very fruity quality and some sweet toasty malt.  Sweet malts predominate upfront, but are soon followed by the bitter/herbal hops. The bitterness lasts to the finish, but never totallly outmatches the sweet malts. The floral and piney character of the hops adds balance.  Body is medium full and somewhat syrupy with a prickle of carbonation and burn of alcohol. Well rounded.  A superb beer!

It's full of floral scents, with sweetness reminiscent of honey, it also comes across as incredibly clean. Subtle hint of barely.  Taste is where this beer shines, I could possibly list off 20 tastes and still be missing quite a few.

10099,2093,Holsie,4.41,"Appearance- It's been a while for me on this one. Amber/dark orange appearance with a finger and a half head enjoyed in a tulip glass. Lacing throughout. Carbonation rose to the top during the entire pour.  Smell-Surprisingly, very little in the way of floral/citrus on the nose. Pine/sweet notes predominate.  Taste-Hops are there but no bitterness--very sweet . Alcohol is really muted well with no burn. Sweet/caramel on the finish.  Mouthfeel-A very slight syrupy nature but what I expected at 9%  Overall--A classic.

10099,2093,turnerk3,4.38,"A: Pours an exceptionally dark golden hew which is pleasantly complimented with an eggshell white half inch head. The inside of the glass is practically painted white by the retention.  S: For a DIPA there is much more of a malty sweetness than expected. The hop notes emerge subtly, providing a pleasant complex citrusy aroma.  T: Complexity does not begin to describe this brew. The hops are present, but not in the typical bitter fashion that tends to linger on the back of the tongue. The malt sweetness works remarkably well at subduing the bitterness of the hops and the warmth of the alcohol. What truly comes to mind is a slightly toasted hop cone cover in syrup and dip in sugar.  M: Astoundingly perfect carbonation delivers the flavors beautifully throughout the mouth. Once the loftiness subsides, an overwhelmingly chewy sensation rushes in to replace it. Truly a wolf in sheep's clothing.  O: Quite an astonishingly unique brew. I know it's labeled as a DIPA, but try to be open minded when enjoying this beer. Dogfish Head uses ""labels"" like titles for a book. A few little words to describe an entire story, so sit back and enjoy.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

This offering has a slightly sweet malt flavor upfront followed by a blast of hop bitterness that lingers long into the finish. This is a spectacular beer - the perfect combination of malt and strong hop flavors.  In a beer world dominated by maximum hoppiness, this offering stands out as something different. This is a throwback type of IPA with a flavorful booziness and a solid balance. It is almost a beer on an island - it is unfair to compare it to the hop bombs that dominate the ranks of DIPAs. On the other hand, it clearly is a high ABV IPA in the tradional sense.  Let's just call it a classic.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,dmatsui,4.38,"Pours a nice deep orange with a two finger head. Good head retention. Not quite as hazy as one would expect.  Toasty, sweet malts hit the nose first paired with a solid, sweet hop presence. tart fruitiness barely comes through, as the malt is definitely more forward.  Peppery hops stand out as the malt base really plays a nice supporting role. The hops are clean, refreshing and citrusy, but more bitter. The real backbone of this beer is the malt, which is just sweet enough as to not interfere with the huge hop presence. The malts are nice and toasty with hints of earthy rye, barley and wheat. A slight coffee-like quality results from the bitterness and roastiness.  Slick, dry, and satisfying. That's it.  Overall, Dogfish 90 is definitely in my top 10 even though i'm a dedicated West Coast hophead. The hops are really bright and playful but it really is the malt bill that I think makes this beer stand out.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,mfc,3.65,"A: Typical characteristics of a big IPA. Caramel, clear, and with a soapy off-white head. Actually, the head sort of takes notes from the body to make it a little darker than off-white. Nice lacing on the glass, too. The head dissipated pretty quickly from two fingers to less than one, though I was using a plain old pint glass, so that's not surprising.  N: Grapefruit and mango upfront followed by softer notes of caramel, toffee, and wood (I mostly get pine).  T: Citrusy and bitter hops upfront continued through until you get a malty caramel finish. It's a great tasting beer--the only thing is it's a little syrupy.  M: The syrupiness leaves me with a tacky feel that is a little unpleasant, and I can also really feel the booze on my tongue and down my throat (which is somewhat to be expected at 9%, and I really don't mind it all that much). Granted, I'd rather have a malty caramel syrup taste to balance it out than just have bitter hops all the way through. That said, I like stouts, nutty brown ales, and other less hop-forward beers more than I like IPAs.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S: Wet dark woods, pine, grapefruit, buttered bread, faint dried dark fruits (dates, figs), and toffee. A diverse mix of aromas that compliment each other very well.  T: Woody, buttered bread, toffee, and citrus. Very bitter with a nice natural syrup-like quality. Flashes of tart citrus towards the end. Similar to aroma with tastes well integrated. Approaching barleywine qualities, especially with the malt/woody aspects.  M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Pleasingly quite resiny, viscous, and sticky.  D: Tasty and satisfying.

M - Fine, but not as crisp as I like from an IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,gradergator,3.11,Served from bottle to pint glass. Appearance is a nice burnt orange with light lacing. Smell is not as big as I expected. Fruity with piney aroma.

10099,2093,denver10,2.95,"A dark copper with a small white head and fair lacing. Surprisingly sweet aroma, I'd almost think this was a red or even amber based on it; largely toffee and bread. Not much of any hop presence it seems. Taste almost has some butterscotch flavor to it, some breadiness, some molassess, with some mild bitterness in the finish.Medium body to this, slight activity. Overall. not quite what i was expecting. I felt this was in between an imperial amber and an imperial pale ale to be honest. Thought it was alright at best.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Edruil,4.44,"Poured 12oz bottle into Stone IRS snifter  Appearance - Opaque copper in color, pours a one-finger off-white head that dissipates quickly to leave a ring and little lacing. A touch disappointing  Smell - Wow. Very interesting. It doesn't smell like a typical Imperial IPA. Earthy and confectionery malt notes are stronger than I'm used to with this style. Spicy and herbal. Pine and citrus hops are detectable but surprisingly mellow - at least in comparison with the West-coast IPAs I'm used to. Some flowery yeast esters as well  Taste - Big bready malt sweetness up front. Molasses, wood, earth, resin. Then the hops break through, and oh boy do they break through. Pine, spices, herbs, some citrus. Alcohol is present and warming but not unpleasantly so. Intricate, big, different. The finish is decidedly dry and hoppy, lots of citrus on the finish. Me like. Me like a lot.  Mouthfeel - Full-bodied, creamy, syrupy. Maybe very slightly overcarbonated  Addendum - The balance improves and even more flavors come out as the beer warms. This is a beautifully complex and subtle beer  Overall - This is my first beer from Dogfish Head, and color me impressed. The flavor profile incorporates such a large array of competing flavors but they're balanced and nothing predominates to the detriment of other flavors. This combines the complexity of some of my favorite Belgian Trappist ales with the bigness and boldness of one of my favorite American styles, and does it stunningly. Well done, Dogfish Head.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Skunky, herbal, fruity (oranges) citrus hop aroma.  T/M: Yum. Simple and straight forward sweet malt taste that explodes on the palate. Hops same way, not in your face but abundance of flavor resulting in sensory happiness.  O: Tons of malts, tons of hops and the best part is they act as complimentary domains. They never try to fight for attention, instead blend together for one of the nation's best IPAs. Huge fan.

A: standard DPA look. Nice head.  S: Hops, with some grapefruit. Hops run this show.  T: Malt flavors and hops control this one. Some floral notes and very slight citrus. The 9 is masked well.

Thought the smell was kind of weak and was expecting a let down with this beer.  Tasted fantastic. Bold yet balanced. Hops a-plenty. Resin, grapefruit, floral. It has a strange, exotic type flavor. When the liquid first touched my tongue I thought, ""hmm this is an odd flavor"" but when I finish swallowing I was like, ""wow, absolutely perfect."" This happened throughout the entire glass. Really, the taste of this beer is perfect. It's mysterious yet 100% rewarding.  Feels very nice. Not overly carbonated but easy to drink and refreshing. Finishes strong, not too dry.  Have to say, after hearing so much about this beer I was not at all disappointed. Would have got a full 5 on the overall score had it not been for the price. There are still several IPA's that are nearly as good but WAY cheaper. Still, a great beer for a celebration!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Definite alcohol burn. Woody, deeply earthy hops. Strong wood notes.  Deep, rich taste. More wood here, along with dark fruit. Strong aftertaste, again with wood (mahogany maybe?) and a touch of maple syrup. Strong alcohol burn.  Feel is very thick and heavy.

I like the taste. ALthough I prefer that west coast hoppy kick, this is a nice change. More roasty sweet malts come through than any other DIPA I've had. Very nice with a little spice at the end. It's 9% but doesn't taste boozey at all, which is nice.  Good carbonation, feels slightly syrupy on the palate.  A great change of pace DIPA. The booze is hidden very well, but sweetness seems to win the fight. A great beer nonetheless.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,rkentb,4.47,"Had my first taste of this today and was pleasantly surprised as I had found the 60 minute IPA to be unpalatable. I tasted this one back to back with several other IPA's and found it to be the best of the bunch.  Color was a deep gold, almost and amber, with a quarter inch of head on top.  Aroma - Compared to the 60 minute and the Brooklyn IPA I was tasting this one smelled more grainy, bready, sweeter, with a subtle hop note.  Taste - Wow! The powerful malt flavor is a good counterweight to the substantial hoppiness. The two combine to produce a single balanced flavor. Reminds me a bit of Magic Hat.  Mouthfeel - more bubbly than the other IPA's in the tasting which was good, the alcohol is noticeable at 9%.  I would give this a 5.0 as it is my current favorite IPA, but until tasting every IPA on earth I'm not comfortable giving a 5.0  Not a chugging beer. This one has a substantial amount of flavor (and alcohol) and would be best enjoyed at a slow pace.

Small bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass.  S: Light and hoppy, with lots of floral and lighter notes, pine, grapefruit, but a strong backbone of hops offsets the lighter notes.  T: Strong roasted sweet malt flavors balanced by the bitterness of the hops that lasts into the aftertaste, but isn't overpowering. Neither the 9.0% ABV or the 90 IBU overpower the beer's taste profile.  M: Felt medium body, not too thick or thin compared to other IPA's I've had, wasn't over carbonated, bubbles kept things in check.  O: For a 9.0% ABV and 90 IBU beer, I couldn't tell it was a 9.0% ABV and 90 IBU beer, because of the balanced nature of this beer.

Plenty of tiny bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass. The head retains very well, dissipating slowly and leaving some lacing on the side of the glass. There are aromas of piney hops, citrusy hops, and sweet malts. It smells a little earthy as well. Hops dominate the flavor. All the hop flavors blend together very well with the sweet malts. It starts bitter and there's caramel sweetness from the malts. The sweet bitter aftertaste lingers, but it is mild. I do not notice the alcohol in the flavor.

Lots of fizzy bubbles coming up from the bottom center of the glass.  S- I really get nothing more than hops in the smell. Very astringent smell, with some piney notes coming through as well.  T- Ahh 90 minute it's been a long time. Up front it begins very bitter with the hops coming through as one would expect. Finishes with a very sweet malty finish.  M- Medium bodied, bitter, sweet.  90 Minute is the DIPA that really got me hooked on the style. Great stuff, sadly becoming harder and harder to find in my area.

S- Hops, hops, hops! Strong hops dominate, but definite malty sweetness is detectable. Maybe a slight hint of honey in there.  T- This one is very interesting. The hops don't smack you up front like with most DIPA's, but they are prominent. Malt sweetness follows the initial, subdued hops bitterness. Slight alcohol flavor follows towards the end. Ends with a slight bite from the hops.  M- Sticky and chewy. Lingers around the palate delivering all of the flavor. Thicker than most, and weight is perfectly appropriate for hop profile. Could be easily drinkable in the summer heat (like now) or as somewhat of a warmer in the colder months.  Overall, I really like this DFH offering. If I were to keep one IPA/DIPA in the fridge for constant consumption, this might be it. I'd be curious to have one a little fresher.

Lots of caramel and a little toasted malt with undertones of bright pine hops. Decent bitterness; signature DFH yeast/water flavor towards the end.

The head lasted a long time for this level of ABV, but eventually disapanted into a thin layer of foam.  S: The aroma is much lighter than expected. There is some floral hops and some caramel sweetness.  M: It has a medium to almost heavy body that gives a very substantial mouthfeel.  T: Almost simultainiously a sweet caramel malt and a grassy, earthy hops blast blend together and balance at a very high level. There is also some alcohal heat that fits right in with the boldness of the malt and hops.  O: This is in the top tier of IPA's. A very American style IPA with the strong malt backbone and a big hops taste. The touch of alcohal heat just adds to the audacity of this beer, and together the hops and heat privide a pleasing and bold bite the really works well for this beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

T: Like the smell, the beer starts out with some caramel malt sweetness. After that the hop flavors take over with very dominant pine/resin and citrus. There is a moderate amount of hop bitterness that lingers in the finish. Other than the finish, the beer is pretty well balanced.  M: Medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation.  O: The higher ABV in this beer is pretty well hidden.

10099,2093,rickyleepotts,4.21,"I have had the 60 Minute IPA… I have had the 120 Minute IPA. But I have not had the 90 Minute. (Note from Sheryl: Yes, he has - he had it with me in Arizona) I had the 120 Minute in Muncie, Indiana, at a sweet little bar call the Heorot. The beer was NOT cheap, but three of us split it. It was a great setting for a very hard to find and very boozy beer. I want to say it is 15%… but I could be wrong. It was VERY thick and delicate, and pretty much destroyed our palates. It was everything I wanted it to be and more!  Tonight we are trying the 90 Minute. I am a BIG fan of IPAs, and I am sure this one will impress me. I like everything that Dogfish Head brings out.  In the Glass: In the glass it looks like a good, polished IPA. That nice rich copper look is what I am looking for when I look at an IPA, and I tend to also look for a creamy head with some solid lace. This one has all of those and more. I haven’t smelled this one yet… which surprises me. Usually a beer like this will scream aroma before I even get it into the glass.  Nose: The nose is loaded with hops, but the citrus really comes out in this one. The hops are not overwhelming, nor is the citrus… but it has a fruity and pleasing nose that any hop head would appreciate. It also smells fresh, and while this bottle has been in our fridge for a while, the beer has stayed true to what Dogfish Head intended.  Flavor: The flavor is solid from the moment it hits your lips. The palate just erupts with flavor and as the beer slides across your tongue and well into the aftertaste you just are overwhelmed with goodness. You get the bitter and you get the hops… you grab the creamy notes from the head. The burp is also good bringing those hops back to the front of your palate. Having had the 120 Minute, this one is like that… but drinkable. You wouldn’t want to drink the 120 Minute fast. You would also want that one at near room temperature.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is great. You start with one sensation and quickly it changes as it moves across the palate. When the beer is finally done destroying your taste buds, the finish is smooth and pleasing. There really isn’t anything wrong with this beer. It is expensive, but it is SO worth it. I was just chatting with a guy on Twitter (@Dr_Rager) and he said he paid $10 for 4 of them. That is a good deal here in the Midwest.  Aftertaste: The aftertaste is great. It isn’t as bitter as you want from a beer with this much clout, but the flavor sticks with you. It is like eating a good steak… one that doesn’t require any sauce. That is what I could compare this beer to. The beer, as it heats up, will also provide a more bitter aftertaste.  The beer is good. Dogfish Head continues to impress me, and I look forward to drinking their beers. There are a couple more on our list, so we will be excited to try those. As good as this is, the 120 Minute is WAY better. It is in another league. But still… this, for as easy as it is to get, is a very solid choice for someone who likes a basic IPA and wants to think “outside the glass”. Bottoms up, people!  90 Minute Imperial IPA - The bottle says: “What you have here is an Imperial India Pale Ale featuring a single, constant 90-minute hop addition. It’s balanced by a ridiculous amount of English Two-row Barley. Then we dry-hop it in every tank.”",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Smell goes straight into hoppy aroma..pine with significant earthiness, almost nutty with hints of cedar. Juicy citrus, some peach and pineapple fruitiness. Aroma hints at the abundant malt backbone.  Taste is basically a really well balanced hop bomb. Solid bitterness upfront but far from overbearing, then loads of sweetness. For how intensely hopped this beer is its very well balanced, almost overbalanced. Taste offers plenty of pine, still with a distinct musty earthiness..sweet malts..slight citrus.

This is the gentler side of citrus -- not full of acidic bite. Some sweetness on the nose as well.  Tons of flavors on the first sip. Loads of hops, malt, and alcohol. Alcohol is heavier than I remember, and a little off-putting early on. Of course, it starts to blend in better with later sips. Hops dominate the entry and finish, with citrus flavors at entry and a lot of vegetal bitterness left in the aftertaste on the back of the tongue.

A sharp sweetness from the roasted malt hits first, followed by notes of citrus, lots of grapefuit/lemon, and pine.  T: So good. It's been a while since I've had this beer, and the maltiness is surprising. I wish I'd have gotten a fresher bottle because a lot of the hops are lost. Sweet malts dominate, very reminiscent of apple juice, with a citrousy finish. The alcohol is just barely noticeable, with only a hint of hops.  Mf: Medium to full bodied with great carbonation.  O: One of my favorite DIPA's, but I think this bottle is a bit past its prime. I remember my others being hoppier, but overall you can't go wrong with this brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Jerone,4.3,"A - Medium amber colored with a finger and a half thick cream colored head, creamy looking head, great lacing.  S - Citrus and pine hops with some malt backbone in there.  T - Tasty citrus hops, I mostly get grapefruit, with a touch of pine flavor. There also is some significant malt sweetness and the alcohol does nip at you a bit.  M - Excellent, coats your mouth with hop flavor and nice carbonation.  O - Very good beer, the alcohol and sweetness of the malt is the only thing that I would alter slightly, but that is me being a harsh critic. Go buy one and enjoy :D.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,threeviews,4.45,"Poured at just under cellar temperature from a 12oz bottle (bottled on date: 03/01/12) into an balloon-shaped, red wine glass.  A- A semi-aggressive pour yields a crystal clear, sunset orange/copper producing a 1-1/2 finger's worth of a soapy, eggshell white head. Carbonation continuously streams up from the bottom of the glass.  S- Aroma is wonderful and signature DH IPA (and not surprisingly very similar to Burton Baton): Sweet orange/tangerine, apricot and some citrus rind are all there along with a sweet vanilla showing up after the head subsides.  T- A moment of sweet malt up front, but before you are done swallowing, orange, and ruby red grapefruit flesh dominate the mid-palate and plow through the malt. The taste on the finish is that of citrus rind. Beautiful stuff  M- Moderate body that is smooth and creamy. Well carbonated, but not overpowering. However, an oily piney bitterness coats the tongue that lingers leaving your taste buds buzzing.  O- Best enjoyed slow, quite warm (at or above cellar temps) and fresh. Although I've purchased this beer several times over the last 5 years, I'm certainly glad to have waited to review this beer. Not only has my palate matured, I am convinced that this is the first time I ever quaffed a fresh bottle. None of my prior experiences with 90 Minute IPA ever featured the hop profile that I have in front of me. Otherwise, this might have been a staple in my 'fridge long ago.  Postscript - Although I am aware that 90 Minute IPA constitutes 1/2 of the recipe, I will still give Burton Baton (my current favorite Imperial IPA of all time) a preference...",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The smell is dominated by earthy, grassy, and floral hops and a bit of fruit with citrus accents. Floral hops first greet the tastebuds, transitioning to sweet malt backbone and finishing with a slight grassy bitterness.

Floral, sweet at first. A nice bitter warm finish. M: Perfect mouthfeel. Sits with a good body, no harsh flavors or aftertastes, and the perfect amount of carbonation.

T: Complex IPA that's well balanced and starts with orange flavors and moves into bitter hops, and piney/grassy territory. M: Very clean and medium-bodied. Medium carbonation.  O: I was actually surprised by how good this was. I love how the herbs and funky hops actually don't diminish the fresh/clean sensation of the beer.

10099,2093,MattSweatshirt,4,"12 oz. bottle dated 3/22/2012 poured into a tulip. Some of the freshest 90 Minute I’ve seen on a shelf around here so I had to grab it.  Produces almost two finger white head and a transparent golden orange body with a nice little bit of lacing.  It just oozes sweetness. Lots of fruity hop character. If pressed to name the fruits I would say grapefruit(doesn’t pop out like a westcoast ipa), peach, and pineapple. Big caramel malt aromas and a slight alcohol presence.  For how malty it is the hops still shine through with some bitterness at first before turning sweet. You pick up on the alcohol for sure. Piney and fruity hop flavor. Thick and smooth.  The beer has the perfect interplay between hops and malt in the nose. It looks, and feels great, but the taste is a little bit of a letdown for me though.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,macrosmatic,4.09,"Reviewed from notes. Had on-tap at O'Toole's in Brandon, served in a nonic pint glass.  A: Hazy deep bronze, thin white head, and a good amount of small bubble visible carbonation.  S: Resin, grapefruit, grassy, and dank with malts that are sweet and only lightly caramel.  T: Follows the nose well, but with more spice hop character. The malt backbone comes through more than on the nose, but still in-your-face with the hops. Moderate citrus rind and spicy hop-bitterness in the hang.  M: Medium body, good carbonation sensation. Alcohol is noticeable but doesn't interfere with the enjoyment of the beer.  O: This is a very good beer that stops just short of being truly excellent. Still, for a DIPA that's relatively routinely available it's solid. Nice hoppiness with the flavors well-integrated, and complex enough to keep the palate entertained for the whole pint.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,jojoluvsbeer,4.42,Pours a hazy copper with a medium sized white head and above average lacing. Aroma is all about floral hops and caramel malt.

10099,2093,Arborescence,4.8,"Appearance: Golden, with a hint of ruby. Pours a massive, dense white head with perfect little bubbles.  Aroma: Complex hoppy aromas, not in-your-face, but rather a sweet and delicate mixture, with hints of honey, apricot, and floral aromas. Fresh too.  Taste: Delicate balance, robust body, flavour develops throughout. Starts with strong but not overwhelming hops, which gives way for mild honey-like sweetness and slight fruitiness. Mildly bitter, lingering aftertaste. Just the right mixture of dry and sweet, hops and malt. The high ABV is not evident; the beer tastes like it's just the correct strength.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, perfect carbonation!  Overall: This is truly one of the top three, if not the best IPA I've ever had. This is not even my favourite type of beer by any means, but Dogfish Head have managed to produce a truly exceptional brew. I'm reviewing my fifth bottle of the beer, and I've thoroughly enjoyed each one of them.

T- Sweetness and citrus hops are the first thing that happens, pine hops are the next flavor that comes out. Very bitter finish with the hops sticking around for a while.  M- Medium body and low-moderate carbonation, very sticky texture with a strong alcohol warming  O- This was one of the first beer I bought after I turned 21, years ago, and it was a good beer then and is a decent beer now. Nice strong IIPA that is deserving of its reputation, though probably not the ""best"" as they advertise on the case.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Barely a trace of a head, but generous sticky lacing lingers throughout drinking.  S: Sweet and floral. The hop scent has subdued (in comparison to freshly bottled or on tap) and the malty sweetness is very strong. Really prepares you for the taste...  T: Which is powerful. Sweet and malty, with a smooth finish. Strong honey notes to complement the deep malt flavor. Citrus and caramel notes as well. I love how the flavor has developed over time. Hop notes come out even stronger as the beer warms. Finishes smooth, with lingering bitterness.  M: Very full bodied, with light to moderate carbonation. Meshes well with the strong flavor profile. Smooth, easy to drink, even though you can easily tell it's 9% ABV.  O: Wow, what a beer. Huge flavor, beautiful smell, well rounded for such a powerhouse. Aging seems to have taken the front-forward bitter hop characteristics and pushed them towards the back, while accentuating the sweet and floral qualities.

Nice golden, amber color.  The smell is of sweet honey and a hint of anise. Citrus hops float in the stratosphere, over a grainy malt backbone.  Much like the smell, the taste includes notes of honey and anise. The bitter herbal and mild citrus is nicely balanced by a toasty malt. Alcohol heat shows up in the aftertaste, but is not off-putting. With each sip, you notice a little something different.  Mouthfeel is creamy. Very interesting, but definitely fitting.  I think I had some bad bottles in my 4 pack. (This is a review of the last of the bunch.) I'm not positive, but whatever. Either way, this is a good DIPA. Maybe it's just grown on me.

Smell: Oily, resiny hops aromas come straight for your sense with the plethora of piney, citrusy, and grassy elements expanding the experience.  Taste: An explosion of hops flavor from all avenues riding amid a sturdy malt body that finishes with a lingering, slightly sweetened, bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Intense, dry, pungent. Medium body.  Overall: A straight and to the point double. Although I've never had it on tap, it's said to be most promising to consume this way.

A - Less than one inch of white, creamy head that disappears quickly; Clear appearance with a medium oranged hued light copper color; Some lacing left behind  S - Big, unique nose for sure with notes of floral and apricot hops, cracked black pepper, sweet caramel, and toasted toffee  T - Plenty of floral hops here as well with a touch of pine and citrusy apricot; Even with the strong hop presence, there are plenty of malt flavors to bring balance - sweet, sugary caramel and burnt toffee; Good amount of bitterness throughout the taste  M - A few notches above medium bodied with some prickly carbonation; Taste is pretty juicy, though the finish is dry with a bit of warmth  O - This DIPA is the real deal and packs a pretty intense aroma and flavor. While the hop presence is pretty strong, there's a good bit of caramel and toffee malts, as well as an equally strong wave of bitterness to bring excellent balance.

Taste: The taste tells me that this an awesome IIPA it has that quality that one expects out of a great IIPA. It has a great hoppy initial taste followed by a malt base that you can taste but plays second fiddle to the hops that stick around to make a great aftertaste.

The head retains well and leaves a very full lacing around the glass.  S - Smells of sweet malt, lemon-like hops, and a touch of oak and breadiness.  T - The hops are very bitter and pine like in contrast to the nose. Fortunately the sweet citrus and malt balance it just enough to take the edge off. I haven't had this in a few months and for some reason I remembered this being maltier, but I am really enjoying the dry hops. Top notch flavor.  M - Highly carbonated with a medium feel. The alcohol is nowhere to be found. I enjoy the dry finish.  O - I tend to take this beer for granted because of its availability, but it is truly a great one. This is an extremely balanced DIPA with great drinkability. It may not be rare or expensive, but that doesn't mean it isn't an exceptional beer.

I had resisted trying this brew due to the price, but finally caved in when I had to bring some beer over to a friend who is fond of IPA’s. Great hoppy aroma comes off of this brew, which I find separates the great IPA’s from the good. Rather than your first sip starting out malty with a hop finish, the 90 minute blasts you with hops from the word go. There are lots of hop tones, such as grapefruit and peach, and a decent amount of bitter coming through, but it works well. The highlight of this beer comes at about half glass when your tongue has become accustomed to the assault of hops, complex malt flavors start to come through.

Not sure if it’s a caramel malt, but caramel was present. Pine. Orange rind. Cough medicine.  Make no doubt, it’s a DIPA. There is some sweetness and even some thickness early on, but as the beer makes its way back, the hops make an appearance. Medium to full bodied. A thick, sticky finish. Definitely bitter in the swallow, but more refined than I guessed it would be.  A very manly beer, but one of the best of the type I’ve had.

It's listed as a ""Double Imperial IPA"", but has substantially less bite than say a Double Trouble or a Hopslam. But as far as taste is concerned, TO ME I think this actually beats them both. This is hard to say as a Michigan Man, and VERY partial to Founders beer mind you. I guess that depends on if you are looking for a very harsh hops bite, or a little more like a typical IPA. This seems to be more like a typical IPA than a Double. Pours out with a typical, yet beautiful, IPA color. This beer is high on carbonation which I enjoy. If there was any disappointment in this beer at all, it was that it didn't have much smell at all... Unless my nose is out of whack today, but it doesn't seem to be. The taste was what blew me away!

Taste: A nice kick of the hops, followed immediately by the intense malt backbone released in the smell. Finishes sweet, makes you lick your chops and go for some more.  Mouthfeel: Very thin and light, smooth sailing.  Overall: I absolutely love this beer. By far one of my favorites.

S- Let this one warm up just a bit and it releases a magical smell of sweet floral hops that seem to be dipped in sugar and drizzled with caramel. The smell is very rich and pleasent but not too intense.  T- This is a very well balanced DIPA. The hop profile is there and it's tasty, but it is not bitter or offensive. Even those who shy from hoppy beers should give this a try. It's malty and sweet. Very much like a fresh American barley wine. This is delicious!  M- Nice, thick, full bodied, not syrupy but there is definitely some substance. Many in this style are quite thin, which can be nice too, but the mouthfeel on this matches well with this well balanced brew.  O- I remember buying this for the first time five years ago. I loved it! It was the first imperial IPA I ever had and surely in the top five BEST I have ever had. I love it because it's available year round and can be found just about anywhere. This beer looks great, it's fragrant, tasty, well balanced and has a great mouthfeel. DFH nails each category here with this one.

S: Alcohol, sweet bready malts, and hops. The hop aromas are lemon zest, orange, tangerine, and grapefruit.  T: A nice balance of sweet malts upfront and hop bitterness on the back end. The hops, which are very citrusy on the nose, are much more of the piney hop variety in the taste, although there is a grapefruit component as well. There is a slight soapy character too, which I sometimes pick up in IPAs (Bells Two Hearted stands out).  M/D: Very smooth. Perfectly carbonated, medium bodied and does a fine job of masking the ABV. Very easy to drink. Great mouthfeel and drinkability here.  O: Double IPAs are probably my favorite style of beer, so I tend to be more picky than most when it comes to beers of this style. With that in mind I’d say overall, this is a pretty good brew but not much better than average for the style. I hadn’t had this beer in a few years and its very different than I remember (I remembered it as an absolute hop bomb with almost nothing to balance it out), and it is better than I remembered. That being said, there are certainly a number of significantly better DIPAs out there. This beer lacks the depth and complexity that is present in the best ones.

Flavor follows with big toffee notes, lots of bitter grapefruit, and a smooth malty finish. This is on the malty side for the style but is nicely balanced with the bitter pine and grapefruit. Slick mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Overall, this is a solid DIPA from Dogfish, but I just don't get all the love for it.

Taste: Almost a spot on replica of the nose. Sweet with layers of mellow citrus hops. Pine and grapefruit play in equal measure. Big juicy fruitiness. Malts are definitely biscuity with some caramel sweetness to round it out.  Mouthfeel: Moderate on both body and carbonation. Smooth and pretty easy to drink.  Overall: I had this beer for the first time in the fall of 2007. It blew my mind. I thought it was the most ridiculous thing I'd ever had, ever. I struggled to finish it, it was that beefy.

S: Mucus, mostly. Head cold. Chicago. Winter. But what I CAN smell is like, ""WHOA! That's beer, alright!""  T: I like to imagine that in the creation of any good IPA, a brewer must employ the services of two bands of opposing mercenary groups - one consisting of tiny little hops vikings, the other barely ninjas, who are awoken upon the field of battle (ie, my tongue) to fight for dominance and everlasting glory.

Hop flavors of tropical fruit, grapefruit rind, with a bit of pine in the finish. Bitterness begins toward the start and lasts, finishing alongside some lingering sweetness.  MF: Full, with a slightly syrupy feel on the tongue; somewhat balanced by the carbonation presence. Bitterness present throughout  I like this beer... the presence of the caramel malt with the hop flavors throughout is interesting, though I'd say the malt manages to garner more attention than what I'd prefer.

When swirled, leaves thick traces on the glass.  Poured cold, the nose is all huge hops, citrus and grapefruit. Once it warms up, the hops fade, the malt takes a stronger role, and the alcohol comes through STRONGLY.  I mean, it's an IPA, it tastes like hops. Much like in the nose, they dominate while the beer is cold, then balance out with the very heavy malt sweetness as it warms. Get it too warm? Lots of alcohol in the aftertaste.  This is definitely the thickest IPA I've ever tried. Only Hopslam comes anywhere close. It coats the mouth well, and doesn't finish dry.

I'm not sure if this is long enough for more of the flavors to come out, but I definitely notice more flavor on this one than I have in previous ones I have tried.  The beer pours a dark orange IPA color. I get citrus, piney, and floral scents, as well as some malty smells. The taste is where I notice a real difference from past times that I have tried this beer (may just be because this is my first beer in a few days, and this is the first multiple day break from beer I have had in a while). The taste is very hoppy, but very balanced with a strong malt flavor as well. There is also a very sweet and fruity flavor. There is a alcoholic hint, but not too strong.

Big sweet whiffs of orange/grapefruit juice carton; molasses is there; it ends with some alcohol.

The taste started with a mild sweetness and a slight bitterness with a note of caramel and then finished quite a bit hoppier with an excellent bitter citrus taste and a slight alcohol presence at the end. The flavor lasted a really nice long time with the smooth hoppy citrus taste fading very slowly.

A: Slightly cloudy golden yellowish light-orange color with 2 fingers of white head, very nice retention, good lacing. Still about a finger of head 5 minutes after the pour.  S: This brew is pretty aromatic, lots of floral and citrus, hops, hint of pine, the citrus smells like tropical and/or dark fruits - possibly pear and raisin, very pleasant.  T: I expected this to be another overwhelmingly piney, bitter, overpowering hoppy flavor IPA like drinking Pinesol (like it's younger brother 60 Min). I was wrong. I'm not even a big IPA fan, but this is a damn good brew.  Starts with just the right amount of hop and citrus bitterness, not overpowering, then switches to sweet and fruity on the mid palate, I'm tasting something similar to banana and raisin, maybe pear, grapefruit and/or orange too, with lots of lightly toasted malts. Finishes with a hoppy orange peel aftertaste, slightly bitter but not offensive. The high ABV is well masked, but there is a hint of astringent alcohol taste present here.  M: Nice and full bodied, medium carbonation, has a smoothness and creaminess that makes it feel silky, and it definitely has some gravity. Slightly sticky and chewy like a dark stout or porter, which is very pleasant.  O: Once again, I'm not historically an IPA fan at all. I generally dislike most IPAs, and despised the DFH 60 Minute IPA, but this one pleasantly surprised me. I fully expected this to be another expensive drain pour, but I will be easily enjoying all 4 bottles of this. I docked a point in the ""overall"" category because, while every other aspect of this beer is easily a solid 4.5, it does come at a high cost. I paid $12 for a 4-pack of this - it's a great beer, but not worth $3/bottle when there are great beers available for much less.  Regardless of the price though, it'll be nice to pick this up as a treat every once in a while, and I'll probably buy it again, but it's much too expensive to buy on a regular basis.

10099,2093,hopfacebrew,4.47,"Note: This review was a re-post from my former account, jmkratt, which was hacked and I lost all my reviews...sorry for the redundancy.  Poured from 12 oz bottle to pint glass.  A- A brilliant copper color with nice 1.5 finger bright white head with gobs of bubbles and lacing as is slowly fades.  S- A lot of fruit aromas in the hops: grapefruit, oranges, other citrus aromas mix with a sweet malt character that's almost like honey on toast. A slight hint of alcohol.  T/M - The beer upfront is mildly sweet with a malty presence with a hint of honey. As it transitions the hop character evolves to a citrus/grassy character. It's extremely well balanced for an DIPA - not overloaded on hops. The malted character really balances out the hop bitterness for an extremely smooth flavor. Perfect carbonation for a medium-full bodied beer.  D- I have to say this is by far the most balanced DIPA I have yet to drink.  Overall, it's pricey so it might be a while for another purchase but it's a fantastic brew. I'd love to try it on draft through a Randall!!

The sweeter malt remains in flavor, but is soon overwhelmed by the hops which really step up their show, intensifying quite a bit with a burst of mostly piney and citrusy hop flavor.  Mouthfeel - A good body but a little on the think side actually. It is very drinkable however as it's carbonation is spot on. The thinner body make this 9% a little too easy to drink (good and bad at the same time).  Overall - A very nice IPA it truly is. In my opinion a little over-hyped, but only a little. Definitely a good brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Bready malts are substantially there. Resinous and green. Very benign, yet most dee-lish.  Big hop zing with a spice note. Dark bread, a little grapefruit, some burnt sugars. Bitterness is medium-high. Some buckwheat honey sweetness intermingling. Nice touch of alcohol in the finish.  Creamy mouthfeel with a sudsy tongue-scrub. Solid.  A well-respected DIPA (for good reason) that will never disappoint. I prefer it in bottle. Always hard to pass up.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The aroma is very complex, some definite citrus hops up front with a strong sweet caramel malt backbone and a touch of smokiness. This glass/keg also had a bit of diacetyl which the server warned me about. I can detect it only because he alerted me to it's presence, I probably would have written the butterscotch off as hops+caramel. The taste is very smooth and complex. The hop forwardedness of the nose is balanced on the palate with the strong malt character and a touch of warming alcohol. The mouthfeel is silky smooth and exactly what I am looking for in a DIPA. Overall this is a really nice beer, a bit maltier than other DIPAs I have had (Pliny, Mycenery) but very nice.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,RedneckBeerz,4.7,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Rogue Dead Guy Ale pint and the brew is a nice amberish orange color with a nice 1+ finger off white head that settles fairly slowly to cover the brew. The lacing is nice and heavy on the pint and is ringed and swirled.  The aroma is bright citrusy hops and amber malts in the background.  The flavor is citrusy hops, both in the nose, the flavoring, and the bittering. For me it's hard to call these citrusy hops bitter though. While they do keep the grain bill from being sweet, there is a brightness to them as opposed to a piney resinous bitter flavor/feel (I'm definately a sucker for the citrusy Cascade/Amarillo/Jade type of hops .... although I have no idea which hops are used here).  The mouthfeel is medium, nicely carbed (tiny bubbles still rising 3/4 of the way through the pint), and no sign of alcohol whatso ever in the mouth or throat.  I think that the style description (which I've judged most brews by) and this beer seem to be far apart i.e although it is robust, I wouldn't call it malty nor alcoholic (aside from the abv.) and to ME the hop profile definately doesn't rip MY tongue out. With that said, i'd fling the style description to the wind because this is a friggin GREAT brew.  Although at this point in my real brew drinking I have yet to try Pliney, nor Hopslam, nor DHCB's 120 Minute IPA (backwoods N.C. abv. laws)  I would have to say that this beer has it all. Looks, Aroma, Taste, Mouthfeel. I'm not sure how much more you could ask for ?? I could kill a 4 pack easily, the problem would come in when I tryed standing up to try an take a wizz. It'd probably be easier just to stay seated and enjoy the great brew and buzz and just piss all over myself with the joy of it all (you know the wife would be kickin my ass ... but that would be OK too after consuming all 4 of these).

10099,2093,TaySuth,4.33,Appearance: Beautiful amber color. The color is what I picture when I think of a good IPA. Small head but great lacing.  Smell: Not especially aromatic but it smells delicious. The hops smell very fresh and mostly citrus. Little to no hint of pine.  Taste: Excellent taste. Great hops flavor is balanced very well. Although the beer did not smell of pine it certainly carries some pine flavor. Has a slightly similar flavor to some quality stouts on the back on the tongue. Very interesting.  Mouthfeel: Just the right amount of carbonation. Solid body without feeling too thick. Good finish.  Overall: An amazing beer that sets a great example of what an IPA should strive to be.

10099,2093,mattbk,4.24,"A: This beer looks heavy. It pours slowly, and looks very viscous. It’s a nice copper/orange color. The carbonation appears light. Bubbles from the bottom of the glass are having a tough time getting through the beer to rise to the surface. Impressive. I thought this might be unfiltered, but it’s crystal clear. The head really sticks to the glass well.  S: Musty and resinous hops waft from the glass. Piney with a hint of citrus. Some light sweetness gets through too. I thought this would be more of a bomb, the low carbonation prevents the aroma from overwhelming. The mustiness is a bit detracting actually.  T: Wow. This is quite sweet actually, rich and flavorful. It pours over my tongue like hop flavored syrup. The hop bitterness is light in front and heavy in the back. Taste of more pine and citrus, maybe more orange than grapefruit. Very little alcohol taste… but I can tell it’s there. This is good.  M: Medium mouthfeel. I’m glad it’s not heavy, it doesn’t prevent me from drinking more. The carbonation comes through more in the mouthfeel than I thought it would based on the appearance and aroma. A bit prickly. I wish the carbonation was more muted… natural carbonation might have made the mouthfeel ideal.  O: Not always a huge DFH fan, but they sure know how to make an IPA. Their 60-minute is dynamite too.

Aroma is quite hoppy with citrus notes but there is also a solid bready malt base.  The taste is quite a bit maltier than I was expecting from the nose. Quite a bit of caramel and toffee with a slight coffee note. Hop flavors are somewhat buried underneath but are present. A nice bitterness is there to balance out the malty sweetness.

Solid malt base and a touch of sweetness. Aftertaste is hops, malt, and caramel sweetness.  M: Medium/full body. Semi-viscous. Balance between hops and malt give contrasting feelings, at first hops brighten and excite the palate, but the malt coats the pallet a bit and reigns in the hops. Wet finish.  O: A classic.

T: Absolutely delicious - Bitter hop taste is the first thing that is apparant, and it follows the smell closely. The really nice thing about this beer is that it is completely balanced out by a sweet fruity/malty/citrusy taste. The bitterness and sweetness keep playing back and forth in the mouth, but they don't overpower each other, and it is a real joy to drink. Also, the 9% is pretty well hidden, in my opinion.

I can detect the 9% abv in there. Lil brown sugar as well. Very slight hop smell if any. Little sad there as it is an DIPA. The glass where you take a sip becomes sticky after you take a sip as its so full of sugary malt!  T- short sweetness followed by a seige of unidentified bitterness then turns sweet again. Slight bitterness sticks around but yet again it is a very shapeless bitterness. I don't know guys I'm not tasting anything that is getting me too excited...  M- fairly thick and at 9% abv you wouldn't wanna have more than one, two absolute tops. I might add that I can already feel the 9% very heavily and am only halfway through it.  O- in my opinion this beer can be summed up with one phrase "" oh-ver-rated clap clap, clap clap clap."" I can't see how the bros gave this such a high score as well as so many BA users. I just don't see the hype here guys. Its decent and will get you buzzin but there are soooo many better DIPAs than this one!! I wouldn't recommend it unfortunately.

When the certain tang of hoppiness attacks the tongue, a drinker is generally in for a good IPA. The initial taste begins mild, but evolves into an assault of varying degrees of hops. Tastes of orange, lemon, and cinnamon dance across the tongue before melting into a warming citrus aftertaste. The mouthfeel is smooth, though I sometimes feel the carbonation is moderately high.  While Dogfish Head no longer delivers to Indiana, it is worth the drive to Illinois or Michigan to get my fix of DFH.

Smell - Malts, hops, caramel, grapefruit, pineapple  Taste & Mouth - The beer has an average amount of carbonation and I can taste malts, caramel, and hops. There is also some grapefruit and pineapple flavour. I can pick up on the booze as well. It ends with a sweet pineapple and bitter hop aftertaste.  Overall – It would be nice if the alcohol was a little more hidden and it was a touch less sweet, but it's still a fantastic DIPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,znichols,3.76,"A- ohhh wow. Yeah this is a pretty 2x ipa. It has a deep, clean orange body and tight white head that last for 2 minutes or so then makes its way to the edge of the glass. TONS of lacing!  S- definitely some pungent hop aroma going on here. I would guess columbus and simcoe. Slightly astringent smelling, it has some over-ripe lemon and cannabis elements to it. There's a touch ofalcohol in there, but not a lot. This barrel was aged 6 months, or so I was told. Lots going on, but its slightly too chaotic and has a little trouble melding together.  T- nice, powerful flavor right away. Very bitter body with some immediate caramel malt sweetness. The hops take over the middle and end with notes of old pine, sour apple, grapefruit, and a slightly off catty-like flavor. This is often due to the use of simcoe hops and isn't for everyone. I don't mind it much. This has some nice flavors. Could be a little more hop flavored than bitter, imo.  M- medium bodied with a decent amount of carbonation. It has a very slick, oily mouthfeel likely due to the alcohol and hop resins.  O- this has always been on of my favorite 2x ipa's. While it may not be the most complex, it certainly isn't one dimensional. Slightly over hyped, I think, but still a classic.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Wonderful mouthfeel; bitter and strong.  O - My foray into IPAs has been a promising one, and this beer has kept me interested.

10099,2093,jegross2,4.2,"Reviewing the 90 Minute IPA from Dogfish Head Craft Brewery. Score: 91  12 oz tap pour in a New Belgium globe glass.  Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy, translucent dark amber color with a thin ring of foamy head around the edge of the glass. Below average lacing, but that's to be expected from a 9.0% ABV beer. 4/5  Smell: Huge citrus hops and honey. Roasted caramel malts and caramelized sugar. Mellow alcohol notes, and a touch of pine. Slightly floral. 4/5  Taste: Very balanced for an imperial IPA. Malty, bitter and smooth all at the same time. Sweet oranges hit first. The roasted caramel malts on the mid-palate. As the beer layers, honey sweetness gradually grow on the mid-palate too. Some spices and hints of leather at points. Detecting mango as well. Finishes with warming alcohol and a piney hops bitterness that really lingers. 4.5/5  Mouthfeel: Medium-full bodied, medium-high carbonation. Oily and smooth. Finish is sticky, warming and bitter. 4/5  Overall: One of the best imperial IPAs on the market. Very balanced and smooth with robust flavors. Superior to both the 60 and 120 minute IPA of Dogfish Head.  Recommendation: A great imperial IPA for beginners, though flavors are probably be a little too intense for casual beer drinkers trying their first craft brew. Hop heads and beer geeks should seek this one out!  Pairings: Spicy Thai food and hamburgers.  Cost: $2.99 for a 12 oz bottle or $5.25 for a 12 oz pour at the bar.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,sniper061,4.52,"I have tasted the 90 minute IPA on a couple different ocassions and it is always solid. A nice dark yellow pour with a head that does disappear but laces nicely down the glass. The reason I am finally doing a review in writing is because I had the 90 Minute IPA with sushi today for lunch. What a combo! The beer with its hoppiness, its clean palate, and citrus/pine finish following a spicy california roll and some raw tuna and salmon was phenomenal. I got nervous at first because I am a little crazy with the wasabi at times but noticed that the seafood and rice teamed up with the pickled ginger and wasabi was complimented completely with the beer. I love good beer and I love good food, the only thing better than both is to find something that goes incredibly together.

Pungent and sweet at the same time.  Tastes of bold hops which are well balanced by the maltiness. The flavor lasts throughout the whole taste, bold and balanced, with barely a hint of the malt sweetness.  Feels sticky and almost thick. Carbonation is right, with a good alcohol sensation.

You can taste the alcohol a lil less than the nose. Wish the bitterness didn't linger as much though.  O: Luckily I'm a big fan of Tropical fruit like Grapefruit. Not to boozey for a high abv IPA.

I had expected more of a hop-forward bitterness from this Imperial IPA.

10099,2093,deadonhisfeet,3.63,"Nice light amber color. Slightly hazy with a thin head that has good retention. The nose is so faint I can't detect much (but at least it doesn't smell bad).  Taste is quite sweet, but thanks to the craftsmanship at DH it's not so sweet that the hops make it medicinal-tasting. Predominant flavors are in the sweet, figgy, jammy department and the hops lend it a slight cedary hint. Certainly lots of malted barley went into this, undoubtedly to balance out the hops. The brewer went for balance here instead of just going for a hop explosion (a pity - no wonder I couldn't smell much). A slight alcohol tinge is evident and it becomes more apparent as the beer warms a bit, but never really becomes unpleasant. Mouthfeel is nice and firm without being syrupy or creamy.  This was a very good beer, but I won't buy it again. It's too well-behaved. If I'm going to pay this much for an IIPA, I'm not looking for balance. I want a bit of chaos. I want disorder. In short, I WANT HOPS! I want a good old fashion tongue lashing. I want a beer I'm going to still be tasting in the morning. I want a beer that newbies take a sip of, make a face like they've just bit into a raw lemon, and say ``good gosh! How can you stand that stuff?''

Great, 2-finger ecru head that settles down to a nice thin foam, leaving some sticky, frothy lacing.  S: Hop-forward, malt-after. The smell is not of dainty flower hops, but if robust earthy hops. The malt spine balances nice on the nose, with aromas of resin, fresh-picked hops, roasted barley, and a hint of candied nuts.  T: This tastes like a well-aged Imperial IPA: blended and smooth in flavor, with a touch of booziness and a mouthfeel on the verge of syrupy. Flavors of barley, leather, earthy hops, and grass mingle in the mouth. Aftertastes of bran muffin and molasses mingle with the dry-hopped feel.  M: Smooth and a touch syrupy in the mouth with a bone-dry and tannic after-feel. It sticks in your jowls.  O: As an example of well-aged imperial IPAs, this is top-notch. Drinkability is not as bad as one would think, given the 9% abv, but I still wouldn't see myself having more than one in a session.

10099,2093,TheBeerAlmanac,4.64,"Bottle poured into a tulip  A: Pours a translucent copper hue with an eggshell foam head, darker than most IPA's but very welcome.  S: Doesn't smell overly hoppy, just appropriately so, and also has a decently rich malt character, sweet and dense. Some spicy and grainy traits develop along with some earth tones. The maltiness in the aroma is almost more telling than the hops.  T/M: Tastes richer and thicker than paler ales and has a mild alcohol grain bite up front, similar to a harsh whiskey but not nearly as potent. Hoppy bitterness starts to become apparent after some time along with caramel and molasses. If you let it warm just a bit, the experience is a lot like a nice bourbon, exquisite, smooth and meant to be enjoyed slowly. The balance is phenomenal but doesn't carry nearly as much bitterness as other, hoppier IPA's.  If you want something strictly hoppy, this would not be the best option, but for a very well balanced beer to sip on, it's hard to get much better than this.

Smell - Big citrus, sweet ruby red grapefruit, touch of pineapple, touch of carmel candy.  Taste - Wow, holy grapefruit! Huge citrus grapefruit flavors here, yellow and ruby. Starts with an almost sweet citrus flavor, like a mix of pineapple and grapefruit, then red grapefruit, then yellow (as the more bitter citrus asserts), then finishes with grapefruit peel n zest, with some sharper bitter pine coming long into the finish - and some green grassy bitter hops. Touch of heat in between sips. This is not nearly as sweet imho as some of the other reviews I've read, just enough to counterbalance the hops here.  Mouthfeel - This one is lite to medium mouthfeel, quite a bit of carb actually, which accentuates the citrus and the crispness, and a few sharp edges on the sides of the tongue. Finish is adequately bitter and dry.  Overall - This is a very good DIPA, although nothing spectacular imho.

Lots of hops but not super bitter tasting, biscuity, sweet malt is quite prominent. More prominent than I’d like at this juncture. On the sweet side, even for a DIPA. Taste is very good but not as hop forward as I used to think it was; times and palettes change, I suppose. Booze is present in the nose, in the taste, and in the finish. Definite warming sensation with this one. Medium carbonation and body with a slightly creamy, sticky mouthfeel.  This is definitely one to try if you haven’t already and are a fan of the style.

Fill the Dogfish pint very nicely with great retention. This has the look of an IPA just waiting for you to drink it.  S: Loads of floral and piney hops hit the nose upfront (jacked up from the 60 minute nose, as expected) with a tantalizing sweet citrus holding its own in the background. Resin like and slightly earthy as the scent tapers off.  T: The beer blasts the tastebuds with juicy hop goodness right off the bat, bursting with a great combination of bitter grapefruit, sweet tangerine, and earthy pine notes. The finish is balanced out by a sweet, crystallized malt character with hints of honey which locks horns with the bitter finish of the hops. Great finish and really beckons one to keep on sipping. The 9% alcohol is dangerously subdued, but does rear its head as the beer warms.  M: Slick, somewhat sticky with a medium body that leaves the palate with a slight oily coat. Good carbonation, finishes dry with a polished amount of bitters.  O: There is a reason this beer has an overwhelming number of positive reviews - It simply is an excellent rendition of the east coast Double IPA which highlights a flawlessly executed, intense hop profile.

The taste is hop-strong and powerful, a little more ""bitter smack"" to it than gentle hop flavor, which I generally seek out in the style. The malt is definitely present, as well as the hop flavor, but I don't think they meld together as one as they should.

10099,2093,trxxpaxxs,3.53,"A: Pours a nice rosy amber. Tons of reds, and pinks in this brew. There is a puffy white head that fades slowly. Decent lacing as it drinks.  S: Smells bready and malty with some notes of lemon and grapefruit. But there is also a noticeable alcohol kick in it.  T: Starts off sweet with some nice malt presence accompanied by some big carbonation. Midway through, the alcohol starts to come shine alongside the grapefruit flavors. The booziness fades in the finish as the sweet, bready, malts return.  M: Medium bodied beer. There are some lingering sweets left on the palate long after the beer has been sipped.  O: This is a decent IPA. There is a big punch of booze in this beer, and it's defiantly not a hop head's dream. It's way more malty that I really want in an IPA.

A: Cloudy amber, with 1/2"" off-white head that settles quickly, leaving fine ring of lacing.  S: Mostly sweet, caramel/toffee fragrance, with some slight citrus and vanilla.  T: Initially very sweet and somewhat fruity, then it levels off. Subtle bitterness -- how does this happen with 90 IBUs? Some evidence of alcohol.  M: Full and very rich. Medium carbonation. Neutral finish.  O: Remarkably balanced, quite complex.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,kkrez,3.98,"This beer pours a gorgeous peach and orange color. Pours a bone-white bubbly head.  Aroma is full of citrus and pine hops, and a little bit of alcohol.  Taste is full of citrus hop, orange, mango, grapefruit, and a little pine. The hops are front and center in this one, very bold and lingering, almost astringent. As with most Imperial IPA's there is a substantial malt presence and this one is no different. Caramel and biscuit malt, but just slightly. Booziness is present, but hidden well. As it warms the alcohol profile increases.  Mouthfeel is a bit resinous and sticky.  Overall, a really good Imperial IPA but it's no Maha",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,danieelol,3.65,"Deepest thanks to mulder1010 for gifting the bottle to me. Cheers!  Pours a red-gold colour.  Nose brings lots of malty sweetness integrated with the hops. Overall impression is of caramel and orange with some grapefruit and tropical fruit. Nice. Nose has some of the most genuinely grapefruity qualities I've smelt in an IPA.  Taste is sweet, but it's also hoppy. Perhaps like a really, really ripe grapefruit. Little bit too sweet for me.  Body and carbonation are medium but the hoppy sweetness is strong and has almost a dessert character. As is so often the case the added sweetness paradoxically emphasises the bitterness.  I like this one more as an American Strong Ale than a DIPA, cause of the malt and sweetness; but perhaps I'm just unused to East Coast style DIPAs. Would probably rate this about on par with 60, although they're very different.  This beer is definitely one and done, took me quite a while to get through the bottle.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Neorebel,4.5,With a deep yet clear golden brown color and a thin head sticking fast to its glass the beer is inviting right off the bat. The beer has a strong roasted aroma with the excellent 'grapefruit' variety hops coming out of the gate. The flavor has the very strong bitter pine anchored by a heavy malt backbone. There is a warming sensation due to the high ABV. Pleasantly bitter overall - not as drinkable in large quantities as the 60 min of course.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,DCon,3.95,"Bought a 4-pack of this from Binny's Beverage Depot in Chicago, IL for $10.99. Poured one of the 12oz bottles w/ a brief description on the front into a 16oz Samuel Adams Pint Glass. Has BOTTLED ON: 10-05-11 on the neck of the bottle.  Aroma- A strong citrus aroma starts this one off like it should be. Has a dry hopped aroma in here as well. Maybe have a clean maltiness behind all this but hop definitely hits the nose hard.  Appearance- Pours a 2.5 finger head that has average retention. Has a deep amber/reddish colored body with a bit of haze. Leaves good lacing behind.  Flavor- Has an extremely high hop flavor and the strength is very great with an appropriate bitterness at the finish. The piney flavor involved here lasts the entire time. Very great drink!  Mouthfeel- Medium Bodied, Medium-High Carbonation, Smooth, but then only has a sweet finish... The hops/piney flavor noted in this brew are almost not present at all.  Overall Impression- Hearing so much about these 4 brews (60, 75, 90, 120), I have now enjoyed 2 of the 4. This one wasn't as impressive as many other 2X IPA's I've been enjoying... Still very good but will have to get my hands on some 120. Would suggest this one for anyone! More like just an American IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,CaptDavyJones,4.37,"Poured a clear dark copper color into an oversized brandy snifter from a 12 oz bottle. Date of bottling and the % ABV were marked clearly. Nice one finger frothy head that dissipated fairly quickly. Good carbonation with a nice steady flow of bubbles. Aroma was very fruity and sweet upfront. almost like candy. As it warms the hop aroma slowly takes over with citrus, grapefruit and faint notes of piney, floral hop goodness. In terms of taste, this DIPA justifies all the hype. Hits the bulls eye; the malt backbone balances the hop excess perfectly. Finish is nice and clean and in my opinion this has to be one of the best examples of a perfectly balanced DIPA. The alcohol is also masked so well that it makes this ale very easy to drink. Of all the three bottled DFH ipa's, this stands out as the clear winner. One of my all time favorite beers, and a must-try for every hop head out there.

The head is about a finger and a half and lingers for quite a while.  S: Great smell, this guy has a lot of grapefruit, citrus and caramel sweetness. The hop presence is all up front, if it tastes like it smells we will be having a good drink  T: Super clean and great grapefruit and citrus notes. Great sweetness and a great finish. Bitter but not overbearing and the alcohol is hidden really well  M: Great carbonation and overall smoothness here. Great drinkability.  O: I am a big fan of IPA's and this is one of the best I have had. It's a little on the expensive side so that's the only reason it doesn't get slightly higher marks.

10099,2093,droomyster,4.38,"Pours a clear gold body with two fingers of white head with excellent retention and lacing properties. Aromas are predominantly of honey and oranges, with a fain whiff of that high abv and funky ethers coming off the top. The taste and texture blow my socks off. The sweet and bitter elements are both intensely concentrated and yet perfectly balanced and finessed at the seams where they meet. Caramel and honey sweetness blend harmoniously with orange and grapefruity tastes while gentle floral notes float delicately through the senses. The gentle, ultra-fine carbonation could not possibly be better.

10099,2093,CyclingLush666,5,"This is one of my all time favorite beers, and I buy it almost every week. It may be expensive but is no doubt worth the price, especially at 9 % you don't need many.  The appearance is a dark brown amber. With a nice thick white head that stays on the top of the beer throughout. I would say an impressive appearance and could be spotted out as a nice IPA a mile away.  The smell is very sweet just like its taste. You can smell the hops and malt, but its not overpowering. It smells how it tastes, delicious and sweet, but not too sweet. I like bitter IPA's but this one is not bitter at all and still packs a huge punch. Dogfish obviously has some master brewers on their hands.  The mouthfeel is great too, very smooth and goes down easy. It is pretty heavy, so if you put away a few of these get ready to feel a nice beer stone in your stomach.  Go buy this beer now if you have never had it. It may seem pricey that a 4 pack is around 12 bucks. But once you try it you'll be hooked and realize all you need is a 4 pack.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The head stays, but especially when I twirl the glass it builds right back up.  The smell is a nice fruitful mix with a slight smell of malt and hops.  The taste is the best part! I cannot say enough good things about the taste of this beer. Its a great balance. The strong ABV (9%) is not evident, and the strong hops are tasted in every sip, but not overpowering. Malt is not too strong, but its there. I love the mouthfeel, the after taste, the everything about the taste of this beer.  I have to get more of this.

One finger head settles and there's great lacing along the glass after each sip. Gorgeous beer.  S: A lovely mix of sweetness and fruity hops. Orange/pinapple scents, with a great fresh hoppy scent. A touch of alcohol is present.  T/M: A smooth, creamy beer with moderate carbonation greets you with your first sip. Hops, with a touch of bitterness upfront, give way to a fresh fruity flavor in the middle (similar to the nose, a sweet citrus flavor), with a present, yet not overwhelming malt flavor throughout. The finish has just a hint of alcohol warmth, but it's very restrained. As the beer warms, the bitterness from the hops becomes the primary flavor, overwhelming the malt that had been balancing the beer. If you enjoy hops, you'll appreciate this brew all the more.

Yes this beer has that strength.I'm not talking ABV I'm talking taste here....when this goes down your throat realize you're having the best.

Smells: A sweet floral hop backbone with hints of candied citrus fruit.  Tastes: sweeter than the usual double IPA, but that is what set DFH a little apart. I pick up a pine citrus hop that takes charge over the balance on the grain taste of the barley.  Mouthfeel: at 9% this is a fairly easy drinking brew. There is a tiny burn that is leveled out with a nice sticky hop taste that is sweet. It is very carbonated until the last sip.

Good rings of lace and a film of retention.  S - Big citrusy nose off the pour. Lot's of citrus with grapefruit and pineapple, soap, caramel or toffee in the background, bread.  T - Woah. Aggressive. Malt is fairly sweet. Hops play a more balanced role with a bit of alcohol here as well. Something is a little odd with the way the booze and hops mix creating a seemingly off flavour. Pineapple comes out alot more with a big malt sweetness making a sort of citrusy, sweet, bready mix with booze in the finish.  M - Chewy bod is full with tingly carbonation. Slightly bitter.  O/D - Oddly not that impressive. Maybe it's just not my style of DIPA or it's the hop variety they used that doesn't jive with the alcohol. The sweetness seems to be intended from the research I've done on their website so the balance is interesting. While it's a solid beer, it's not one I would've pegged as a DIPA.

The 90 minute's head is thick and off-white. The mouth feel is soft. On the palate, this beer plays a trick. Strong hop flavor mellowed with a great malt smoothness.

I finally found a bottle that's less than a month old today, so I'm going to give this one another shot.  12oz bottle (bottled 9/15/11) poured into a tulip. Rich amber color, perfectly clear, with a 1-finger head. Really beautiful color.  Aroma is floral hops and something buttery/oily in the background (booze?) - smells good but it's not a blast of aroma by any stretch.  Taste is caramel malt and floral hops. Nice slick bitter finish. Really nice creamy mouthfeel.  This is still not my favorite DIPA and may not even make my top 10 - the caramel malt is just a little too prominent, hops are present but don't really bring a counterbalance to the malt or even really draw a line under it. This is clearly a well-crafted beer, but the malt/hop profile just isn't doing it for me.

Full lacing on the glass with bubbles sticking to the glass for a good amount of time.  S- Sweet, oily hops upfront in the nose with an also sweet malt afternote. Slight alcohol fumyness  T- Oh god. Bittersweet hop/malt profile intertwines perfectly making it easy to love this beer. Aftertaste has the sweetness of the hops hanging around a bit but the strong malt backbone lingers on as well. The only thing that makes the taste less than perfect is there's a bit of a metallic finish but I think that's due to everything smashing together on the palate at the same time.  M- Quite creamy and lively with a high amount of carbonation bringing the whole package together.

Almost delicate citrus aroma that is very different from the usual piney/grapefruity character of most US IPAs. Malt is biscuity.  T - Much more going on than 60 min. Lots of bready malt with the amazing citrus/grapefruit hops. Yeast adds some flowery notes and alcohol plays in the background.  M -Moderate body, smooth carbonation. Sweet finish but not cloying.  D - Incredible balance between malt, hops and sweet finish. Very drinkable. This is amazingly easy to drink for a beer of this strength and IBU level.

Clean floral aroma, with fruity esters and an herbal quality. Slight malt presence with a hint of boozy alcohol.  T: Floral and piney hops with some ripe plum and other dark fruits.

Has a good amout of crispness, but pretty smooth.  O: This is a very great beer. Dogfish Head knows how to make something great with a twist.

10099,2093,CheezyBlaster,4.45,"I've had this treat dozens of times, first time reviewing.  Beautiful amber IPA, small coaster-thick head, disappears slowly -poured into wide goblet, so I didn't expect a huge head.  Sniff: crazy malty caramel and fruit (peachy sweet) nose for an IPA, bu the hops are still nicely present. Can smell a hint of the alcohol, which I kind of like in this case.  Sweet malt, sour hops, and booze combine for a mouthful of awesome. So unique among the style. Feels like an IPA/Strong Ale combo. Has that scotch-like finish. This is one boozey tasting brew.  I like the semi-sticky but moderate mouth-feel of this beverage, however, I've never been a fan of how it finishes out with a sour/acidic coating lingering on the tongue. It's the only real drawback for this beer.  I love this beer. Funny thing is that I would never grab this if I were looking for an IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Also pine and caramel malt. Hops are the focus but it is certainly a well balanced beer, as DIPAs go.  Taste is pretty similar to the nose. The caramel malt is more upfront than in the nose, and the pine a bit more forward than the citrus. Still some grapefruit, but not a lot. Bitterness is present throughout, but nicely balanced with the malt. Crisp.  Moderate to mild carbonation and relatively full bodied. Pretty good feel.  I think this was the first DIPA I had, and it remains a favourite. Really a nice beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The head remained for awhile that left lacing behind.  The smell again for an IPA was kind very subdued. Lots of malty sweetness, which I was not expecting. The hops gave a citrusy smell.  The taste was very sweet. It kind of was like a mix between maple syrup and carmel syrup. The sweetness was nicely balanced out with the citrusy hops. Together they had a nice meld, however, not as hoppy as I thought it would be.  Mouthfeel for this beer was good. It was full bodied for sure, and was slightly thick. The hops yield a nice oiliness that coats the mouth.  Overall this is a well done beer. It is an imperial IPA that is quite strong (9.0% abv). So one and your already packing a buzz.

Moderate strength aroma. It's pleasant and welcome.  T: Bittering hops are pleasant and nice, but restrained enough to avoid destroying the flavour. The light barley base is nice and unobtrusive. It's decently built but rather simple. It's certainly well balanced.  Mf: Smooth and wet, suiting the flavours. Nicely complementary.

Appearance: Clear burnt copper color, very nice. A one finger off white head sits on top, receding fairly quickly but leaving some lacing as they go.  Smell: I get the malt more than the hops, or at least equal. Nice toasty, caramel malts scents mixed with a piney, resinous hops scent. A little sweetness and slight boozy notes.  Taste: Perfect balance. The malts play so well with the hoppy bitterness. As with the nose, the malts have a slightly sweet toasted taste. The hops are pine mixed with some tropical fruit and slightly earthy, too. The liberator I had the other night was so unbalanced, and this is the opposite, perfectly balanced. The malt stands up against the hops. The finish is lingering but not overwhelming. I suspect this is my first 5 in this category.  Mouthfeel: The body is medium to full, with enough carbonation to keep the beer from being heavy but not so much that it is like sprite.  Overall: Really enjoyed this beer, I can see why they cut back on distribution. The demand should be great for this one. I would like to try it really fresh or on tap at some point.

Powerful and bitter pine and citrus hops up front give way to the taste of malt and alcohol lingering slightly on the tongue. Are the flavours well integrated? Not really. Are they interesting? Yes.

The other night we went out to eat and this was the only beer on the menu I hadn't tried before so I figured it was about time I gave it a shot. I like Dogfish Head so I wanted to like this.  It poured very dark, much darker than I'd expect from an IPA.  The smell was what I was expecting from an IPA with a slight hoppy aroma.  The taste was unlike anything I'd been prepared for. There wasn't much in the way of bitterness. It had an almost creamy and bourbon-flavored taste. Much maltier than I expected.  The aftertaste had a grapefruit flavor mixed with (and I know this doesn't sound appealing) a nail polish remover flavor. This is the ethyl acetate smell but, strangely, it wasn't displeasing at all. It was subtle enough that it didn't take away from the flavor.  Overall I was super impressed with this beer and would love to try it again. It's anything but a typical IPA but coming from Dogfish Head that shouldn't be a surprise.

The nose is of big resinous hops upfront, and is quickly followed by pleasant caramel malts.  The taste is quite enjoyable, though there is a significant balance in the hops and malts. Much like the nose, resinous hops and caramel malts dominate, in that order.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a very slight mouth-coating slickness and average carbonation.  This was a very nice beer, but the balance in hops and malts reminds me more of a hop-forward American Barelywine than an Imperial IPA. I look for much more hops with less malts in an IIPA, which is what keeps me from giving higher scores in the aroma and taste categories.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Excellent retention and excellent sticky lacing  Smells of citrus and pine hops explode out of the glass as it is poured. Oily/resinous hops dominate the smell with sweet caramel malt in the back ground. Great smelling beer!  Taste follows the nose. Pungent piney and juicy citrus (orange and pineapple mainly) hops dominate the palate. I love how oily the hops are in this beer! The caramel malt tries to balance this beer out but it is too weak to take on the hops. Like the old saying goes, if you cant beat em, join em. So the caramel malt lives in harmony with the hops and just enhances the total flavor in the end.  The mouthfeel is one of the things about this beer that really makes me love it. Nice and full body for an DIPA. Its borderline syrupy but the carbonation definitely keeps it from going over the line. Coats your entire mouth with hop sex appeal with each sip. Lingering aftertaste, makes you thirsty for more.  As far as I am concerned a fresh 90 minute is about as close as a staple of a DIPA as you can possibly get. It is a very well made beer. Sticky, oily, juicy hops! Great body! Great aroma! This beer has it all without going overboard to get there in my opinion.

Pretty full body, decent carbonation and smooth finish with only a slight alcohol estery presence.

Hops have a great infusion here, barley sensed too. More herbal and spicy than citrus hops.  Rather bitter on-bringing, crunchy aftertaste that owes to the 9% alc. content and plethora of hops.

T - Initial hops bitterness with notes of citrus and a slight grassiness, yields to reveal a perfect malted barley complimentary note at the finish that sweetens the beer considerably.

10099,2093,mayorwalda,4.6,"Here we go, my first review of a pale ale and it's a mighty ""Imperial IPA"" no less.  Right off, Dogfish Head's Imperial IPA pours a nice (curious) amber color and gathers at the top of your glass a nice foamy head, which releases a bouquet of floral hopps and a very slight, if there is said to be one at all, grassy aroma which IPA drinkers know and love. The explosion of aroma that you get from pouring a good head of this beer is a perfect example of why people love the head on their beer--and right now, I’m loving it.  Upon the first sip, well, simply put, I was shocked, maybe a little floored. This beer is so amazingly well balanced and it took me completely by surprise with all the talk (on the bottle) about this being hopped for 90 minutes, etc. etc. I had been expecting a swig of pure hopps with a tail end of alcohol bite, but this beer is really, really malty and its smoothness is unparalleled by any IPA I’ve ever had. This beer also has a unique alcoholic bite (09% ABV), and I find that odd too, but this is an Imperial IPA after all, and with the title comes (much) more of both hopps and barley and that of course means more sugar for the yeast to turn into blessed, blessed alcohol. The somewhat higher ABV is unique especially given the depth of this beer’s taste and I think that while some beer’s higher ABV is a detriment to what might be an otherwise smooth brew, this IPA benefits from its boost in ABV. I might go as far as saying that this brew’s ABV keeps it an IPA, because honestly this beer is so smooth that it makes you forget you’re drinking an IPA. It is the aroma of this beer and its curious alcoholic bite that make you to remember you’re drinking a very fine, surely unique IPA.  Beyond the taste of this beer, which lends you a variation from your day-to-day IPA, this beer feels and drinks more or less like an ordinary IPA. The beer is crisp, well carbonated and light in mouth. If you’re into IPAs give this one a shot. It might not take the spot of your favorite IPA but you certainly won’t forget it any time soon!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Sweet caramel malt and a nice smooth citrus hop bit. Dry finish with both lingering sweetness and rindy bitterness.  This is a smooth and sticky - still an easy drinker - could use a hair more carbonation. Abv floats around after a sip with some great warmth.  It's DFH - it's 90 Min IIPA - what else do you want?

A vigorous pour yields a 1 1/2-finger cream-colored head that recedes after a few minutes to a thick and somewhat clumpy coating and thick foam ring. The body is a hazy orange amber. Some light lacing can be seen clinging to the glass throughout consumption.  Citrus and pine hops combine aromas to create a well-blended, nearly singular aroma with some spiciness in the background. Notes of citrus peel and grapefruit make up the citrus hops aroma nicely. Sweet, caramelized malts add a great balance to the nose.  Sweet, bready, and caramel malts pair with citrus, grassy, and pine hops to create a very well-balanced taste. The hops flavors are complex and bold but kept well in check by the malts. The bitter aftertaste does not become very strong but is quite satisfying. A slight alcohol warmth is present in the back of the throat.  Medium to full bodied with decent carbonation, this beer is not the most drinkable DIPA out there, but is certainly one of the most delicious. The body is a little thick and is certainly both coating and sticky.

Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, not much carbonation, a slight hint of alcohol, but overall very smooth.  Overall: This is a complex beer. It is extremely well crafted and all of the different flavors bend together perfectly.

Good lacing with partial retention. I expected this to be very hazy for some odd reason.  S ~ Pine Resins & Grapefruit fading into bitter notes of cut-grass slathered with honey. Malt aromas are rich & full.  T ~ Barley coming through really strong lending brown sugar, marmalade, sweet bread & leafy vegetal notes. Hops are ever-present as well; Bits of Orange oil, Spruce & a touch of herbs. The resinous notes that drive the nose meld well into the background beside the bold malt flavors.  M ~ Bitterness & hop bite are really unique paired with the subtle carbonation achieved here. Large amount of fresh/dry hop flavor with a Malt-driven body. Citric, Sweet, & Never becomes too ""oily.""  D ~ Very long overdue trying this one. The UK Malt used was really well played. Good body, good flavor, & ideal ABV for the style.

10099,2093,TheBrewo,4.1,"We pop the top and pour a darker honey colored ale. It holds a stark white head of one finger, which recedes rather quickly into a congregation of fatty bubbles over half of the surface of the liquid. A one finger head is easily reproducible with a quick swirl. The last drops from the bottle give thick swirls of haze, whereas no other sediment is outright noted. Carbonation appears active. The nose is sweet with bright citric hops, and a sugary citric quality. There is also a significant malty vibe, given with some slightly caramel and toasty grain. The booze is apparent, especially with more warmth, but doesn’t become overpowering. Sweetness is furthered by a light fruitiness of maraschino cherries and pear. As we sip citric, floral, and soapy hops meld and present up front. Here, too, we get bitter and souring grain with less sweetness and caramel as was found in the nose. The middle evens out quite a bit, giving a softer sweetness, of vanilla, and those exact fruity notes found in the aroma. There are additional honey sugars to move the taste along. In the end, the final flavors to leave the palate are a smooth graininess, and a spiciness, of brown mustard and oak. The aftertaste breathes heavily of hops and booze. The latter is in a rum-like flavoring, with stingy fusel alcohols and a synthetic fruitiness. Plastics also breathe through after the drinker sits for a bit. The body is medium and the carbonation is medium to high. The feel to each sip is with a nice froth and creaminess. The mouth is nicely coated, and left rather cooled for something so hoppy and initially bittering. The abv is within range and the beer drinks rather easily.  Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the sweet and sticky aroma. It had a perfectly balanced malt character, with caramel and darker grain, but also delivered robustly on the hop front. These were citric and contributed nicely to what the malts were offering. This is a standup DIPA, and the exact older brother one might expect from something so outstanding as the 60 Minute IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Leaves a spicy, herb taste in the mouth. The mouthfeel is nice and slighty chewy, carb is spot on. Semi-dry. There's a slight alcohol to it, but for a 9% it's hidden pretty well.

My logic was that I could always get it when I wanted... tonight I realized that the last time I had this beer was about a year and a half ago. And, this is a beer that I really enjoy.  The restaurant poured the bottle into a shallow red wine glass. Normally I want to pour, but this waiter did it with a flourish.  He got about one finger head from pouring 6 ounces. The coloring is a light brown with decent carbonation.  The smell is still great. I get tons of hops.  The flavor is really well balanced.

Smells like overripe orange and lemon, grass and plum. The smell itself is very intense, but I fear that the beer might be a little too dense.  Woah! Not bad! I still wonder how this brew can be refreshing even with a 9% ABV and such an intense taste. Quite earthy, with lemon and orange vibes. Less hoppy that I thought it would be, but it could be due to the age of the bottle (2+ years).  This is the overall balance I wanted in a beer. Very enjoyable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Mouth feel: The beer feels dry and spicy with a pleasant alcohol kiss at the end; it's just enough to remind you the beer is 9% ABV.  Overall: A very good IPA that I would have again any day.

10099,2093,OMGTheyKilkenny,4.74,"Draft into a pint glass  A- Incredibly clear, reddish-orange amber. Very neat carbonation. Half an inch of eggshell tan head. Medium to heavy lacing.  S- Hops, hops, and more hops. Extremely fragrant, like walking through a pine forest. Cascades dominate the extremely powerful hoppy aroma. Just a little bit of sweetness keeps it from being overpowering.  T- Very surprisingly, the malt character stands out just as boldly as the hops. Sweet and smooth, almost caramel malts provide excellent support for the rich hoppy flavor. Floral and fruity, spicy and sweet, it really is a buffet of hops. Hops dominate the aftertaste and leave a very strong presence behind.  MF- Full bodied and thick. Nice carbonation. A little syrupy, but generally goes down smooth.  D- I honestly ordered this expecting a novelty beer, but I was treated to one of the finest brews I’ve enjoyed in a very long time. I’m typically not a huge fan of Dogfish Head, but this is a prime example of what they do best: IPAs. Had I not known better, I’d have guessed a high ABV, but not 9%. That said, very drinkable given how strong it is. On tap always beats bottle, but that’s especially true with this beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Nice caramel maltiness balanced nicely with nice floral hops, a touch of pine resin and leather on the back end.  Full bodied with a creamy and semi viscous mouthfeel with medium carbonation.

S - Very complex aromas, starts with caramel and toffee, plums, raisins, a light tangerine and subtle pine/resinous, hint of mild chocolate, peach, mango, and ripe melons. Has a mild floral alcohol note. As it warms it gives hints of vanilla and bourbon (w/o the wood). By the end there is a more pronounced piney/resinous nose.

M - Smooth deep bitterness with a robust spiciness, med body, light alcohol warmth on the semi dry, yet sweet, finish  O - Great beer, really enjoyed the complex flavors and aromas from the deep rich malt backbone to the hops. Refreshing change from the West Coast hop bombs that have nothing to them but, well, hops. Very balanced IPA, intensely complex. This is my 4th dance with DFH 90 over 2 years. The first one I found quite sweet, the second too bitter, the 3rd not hoppy at all...

Nice lacing going on as well. A pretty attractive looking DIPA.  S.  First aroma I get is sweet malts..notes of caramel and perhaps a little tea. Hops are noticeable, but not as pungent as I was expecting. Some slight citrus and grass in there. Alcohol presence is subtly detectable.  T.  A good combination of sweetness and bitterness. Tastes of toasted malts, caramel, citrus rind and some pine. It is pretty malt dominant IMO, however the bitterness prevents this from being a total malt bomb. It is still a pretty enjoyable DIPA and pretty much what I expected from DFH.  M.  medium to full bodied with great carbonation. Creamy and slightly sticky mouthfeel which is expected from the sweetness to it. Pretty solid mouthfeel for an East Coast DIPA.  O.  A pretty decent showing from DFH.

Overall, it's a good beer and a solid DIPA. It's got far more caramel malt/dark fruit character than any other DIPA I've had, almost making it barley wine like, but the hops are definitely there. It's sweetish, but never quite goes into 'sweet' with the persistent hoppy character. Glad to have tried it but in the end I must admit it's just not my thing. If you're into the darker, maltier DIPAs then this should roll right through your alley.

10099,2093,kflorence,4,"A: Pours a copper in color with hints of amber and orange. A good half inch of thick, foamy head sits atop, dissipating to a thin layer of creamy film with plenty of lacing on the edges of the glass as you drink. Nothing special here, but quite appropriate for the style.  S: Very intriguing aroma. Malted barley, pear, grapefruit, lemon, spice, and maybe a bit of pine are predominant. There is definitely some alcohol lingering in the background. Seems to be pretty balanced for the amount of hops present.  T: Impressive. A good blend of malted barley and various kinds of hops give this one a nice balance, though it is definitely hop-dominant (as it should be). The flavors follow the nose pretty well with notes of citrus and pine and a bit of spice on top of a wonderful toasty, caramel malt backbone. Finishes crisp and dry with a blend of malts, pear and alcohol astringency. The 9% ABV definitely makes its presence known, especially towards the bottom of the glass.  M: This one is medium bodied with a bit cream, ample carbonation and an oily quality to it that coats the tongue. Definitely sits a bit heavy in the stomach, but remains pretty drinkable for the high ABV.  O: Glad I finally got around to trying this one, it definitely lived up to its hype. That said, this is a very potent brew and probably not one I could handle on a regular basis. The blend of flavors is quite simple really, but also quite solid.

The beer was a light, pale copper-golden color with a thick, two and a half inch layer of big-bubbled, biege head. Aromas of grapefruit and pear, with a heavy dose of tangy hops, with a lemon-peppered like spice to it. Flavors are very well balanced, with citrus-pear sweet tones once again, balanced with a peppery, roasted hops character that takes over the palate. The sweetness and the round body keep the hops from being too dry, and the carbonation level keeps it light and crisp. Great lace cling on the glass.

Big mango, apricot, grapefruit followed up by a warm but light lingering alcohol feel. Big sugary fruits touch on the tongue, followed with some spice and alcohol, very sweet and delicious.

10099,2093,BeerPhan86,4.42,"This beer appears consistently on the top ten lists of best craft beers in America, and for good reason. It is an excellent example of the style and delicious fresh and aged. This beer, the Barton Baton oak aged version, and Squall are three of my favorite DIPAs. Let's get into it!  A - Pours a mostly clear ruby amber with a one finger yellow/tan head. Good retention on the head and exceptionally sticky lacing on the glass.  S - Very thick and sweet initially followed by noticeable Amarillo and Simcoe hops. I am fairly certain from reading various clone recipes for this beer that the ""mystery hop"" they have combined with the Amarillo and Warrior hops they list on the packaging is Simcoe. Lots of citrus and fruit notes in the nose.  T - The taste is not as sweet as I would expect from the nose. Huge amounts of hops with mainly grapefruit and pine flavors. The finish is fairly sweet and malty but has that classic Dogfish Head ""toasted caramel"" taste one can find in the 60 Minute IPA. A little bit of alcohol is noticeable in the finish but it is quite well hidden for the 9% abv. Very well balanced for an imperial IPA, neither too sweet nor too hoppy for my tastes.  M - Thick and quite sticky on the lips. Carbonation level is low which is perfect for this style and lets you really appreciate the flavors going on. A bit oily and slick.  O - Overall, one of the best DIPAs currently available and definitely worth checking out. Dogfish Head does an excellent job with this style of beer and I have highly enjoyed each one they put out.

Cherry comes through minimally, cant really smell the hops under all of that. Taste is a rush of malt and candi sugar up front. Not sure how the candi sugar gets there since it is not used but that's what I get. After that rum soaked cherry with minimal rum and mo cherry. The aftertaste is where the cascade comes through giving off bitterness and floral all at once. Sweet with faded candi taste, if the cascade was not run through the randall this would be a hot mess cause 90 minute is kinda ewww.

10099,2093,Janderson91,4.21,"Bottled on 05/26/11. Enjoyed on 07/23/11.  A - This is a perfect looking DIPA. A bright, clear dark orange/amber color with a good two finger white head. Leaves a literal wall of lacing down the sides. Amazing.  S - That signature DFH maltiness is there. Big nutty, bready, biscuity malts along with some floral grapefruit, citrus hops. Just not quite as hop forward as I would like.  T - The taste is just like the nose. Very rich and sweet. Biscuity, nutty malts all the way through with a crisp grapefruit hoppiness through the middle and at the finish. Also a little hot. Leaves a lingering bready sweetness on the palate.  M - Mouthfeel is near perfect. Very creamy with pretty low carbonation.  O - Overall, this is a superbly crafted beer. It's no hop-bomb but it knows that and it is excellent for what it is. One of my favorites.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Scotchboy,3.71,"Gotta thank Jonah for this one. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a New Belgium snifter.  A: Chill-hazy golden orange color, with an excellent frothy off-white head with tight bubbles. Carbonation is screaming off the bottom of the glass, and this beer leaves good lacing down till the end.  S: Unique hop profile, I'm picking up overripened mango and dried apricot, as well as black pepper and a significant caramel/sweet bread malt backbone. Barleywine-ish. Maybe a touch of alcohol?  T: Surprisingly sweet and malt-forward; this beer has a lot of the same characteristics as HotD Fred, with some added hop flavors and bitterness. Its definitely got that candy sugar feel. A touch hot.  MF: Thick body, with a good coating mouthfeel. The alcohol doesn't seem to cut the mouthfeel too much. Not too drying.  O: A tough beer to judge, I like it but it wouldn't be one I'd seek out again. It's hard for me to believe this is what it's supposed to taste like as a DIPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Not as floral as the 60 minute, but still smelled beautiful  T: sweeter than I expected, must be all that 2 row! Had a definite sweetness followed by hop overload, (a good thing). Finally resting with a warm alcohol finish  M: drank smooth, had a strong warmth of alcohol, not chewy and not thin by any means. Balanced  Overall impressions were good, although I still stick with the 60 minute is much hoppier. I understand there is more barley so it is bound to be maltier, however the hop balance was good.

Smell is mostly malty. Caramel and almond notes. Biscuity. Floral hop notes as well.  Taste is also highly malty. Rich caramel sweetness up front. Big biscuity backbone holds the brew together. Assertive yet not overpowering hop character of pine needles and citrus fruits. Overall, the flavor is way more sweet than what I expected and not quite on par with the style. Nonetheless, it is still tasty and works well.  Rich medium to full-bodied consistency. Sticky malt feel allows plenty of time to enjoy the complex flavors. Lively carbonation brings flavors to the tongue as well.  No doubt that this is a good brew. Different from other examples of the style but it's a refreshing kind of different. Well done.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S- Super floral with roses, coconut, pineapple and pine all flying out of the glass.  T- High levels of sweet caramel and toast underlying even higher levels of hop flavors of citrus, pine and more coconut. The flavor is nice but there is little change from start to finish and the bitterness doesn't pull much more on the back end as the beginning. The pininess also drains on my taste buds after some time, wish other characteristics shined a little more.  M- Light with moderate carbonation. Refreshing from start to finish.

Smell: Complex, thick smell...very enjoyable. Lots of spiciness and citrusy aromas; a little alochol in the background.  Taste: I got a deep roasted flavor in the back of my throat first, then a wave of bitterness coupled with heavy spiciness took over. Some thick kinda syrupy sweetness towards the end and finishes with a warming alcohol sensation. Leaves a earthy, bitter aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a slick feel to it; tingly, very present carbonation.  Overall: Heavy on the hops, strong flavors, lots of taste variety...Delicious brew.

T: talk about some lip smacking hop goodness. bitterness is smooth and well balanced with a good amount of residual malty sweetness. drips with caramal towards the finish and then back to a refreshing bitterness.  M: a fine carbonation lets the flavor shine on this big bodied beer.

10099,2093,magictacosinus,4.67,"Poured into a tulip glass from a bottle. (Beer was bottled on 6/16/11.)  Appearance: Pours a pretty looking copper color with some golden hues. This beer poured with no head in the glass. I'm either blaming the glass used, the cold temperature, or the beer's age. A very thin ring remains at the top of the glass. Several minutes after pouring, all of the carbonation vanished. Hmmm, odd.  Smell: Whoa! Pine scented hops and fruity, sweetened malts unlike any other IPA I've smelled yet.  Taste: Everything you want an imperial IPA to be, really. The unique combination of dry hops and malts in this beer create a beautiful tasting experience. I'm getting sugar-coated bananas, passion fruit, pineapples, blood oranges, caramel... Just wonderful. The high ABV on this beer is definitely a factor that sweetens this brew, yet I'm astonished that at 9%, it barely overpowers the flavors.  Mouthfeel: This may be an imperial IPA, but I can barely tell due to the malty creaminess that this beer has. Rather than bite the tongue, the hops instead dance and flow gracefully on the palate and leave you with a comfortable sweetened aftertaste. As it warms up, it begins to taste more syrupy. It's not really warming me up too much, though, which is surprising considering its high ABV.  Overall: What's there more to say, really? This is an imperial IPA that topples so many others of its kind in terms of flavor uniqueness, easy drinkability, and wonderful aromas. I've never really had a beer quite like this before. I hope to get a much fresher batch the next time I purchase this and find out how age is a factor on this beer's quality - because if it tastes great after one month, I'm curious what the results are from one week!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,nandemo1,4.5,"Pours a beautiful light amber with a golden hue. Beer is crystal clear with light carbonation.  Smells of pine, malt and slightly of citrus. Taste is quite sweet, but also full of hop bitterness. I'm not pulling out any specific flavors for some reason though.  Mouthfeel is sticky with the high malt content, definitely lingers for a while.  Overall a very sweet, very tasty dipa, will have to try another bottle soon to see if I can identify some flavor components.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,S7R4nG3,4.2,"Pours a dark golden with about half a finger of cream colored head. Very nice lacing as you proceed through the drink.  Smell has notable roasted malty hops with some sweet herbals. I also seem to detect some sweet syrup smells looming in the background.  Tastes just as it smells, some good roasted malt flavors with sweet herbals, a good thicker mouthfeel with some nice warmness from the alcohol in the aftertaste.  Overall I really enjoy Dogfish Head's IPAs, they have great flavor depth and character separating them from the crowd.

Kind of like banana  T- Hoppy and bitter initially and this finish is too complex for me to describe. It was bitter and sweet at the same time. Absolutely delicious.  M- Envelopes my entire mouth in the taste that makes me want to go back for more.  O- Great to sip on while enjoying a meal. Not one to just gulp down.

Pours a really nice golden copper with a shallow, white head.  The smell is very sweet and potent (is alchoholy the term?) at first, with some fruits and citrus noticeble shortly thereafter, and finishes with mellow malts.  The taste is too complex for me to analyze/explain at this early stage of my dive into beer geek status. Let's also say I'm not through it, the first beer tonight, and words are already hard to come by. It's strong, but well balanced and I thoroughly enjoy every sip.  It feels good in my mouth.

Hints of sweet malt and alcohol are more present in the background than the 60 minute. Also noted some caramel in the aroma as well.  T: Nice blend of citrus from the hops, malt, alcohol and sweetness. Hops are more forward in the taste but are quickly joined by the others. All fades to a nice lingering bitterness with traces of raisins, caramel. The finish lingers for a while after each sip.  M: Medium body nearing full body, velvety with the carbonation. A bit sticky and feels as if there is a film left in the mouth.  D: Definitely a sipper but very enjoyable.

Aroma: Light floral with hints of citrus  Mouthfeel: Creamy with a nice pleasing medium carbonation that stays on the tongue  Taste: Crisp opening that has floral notes. Lingering citrus that ends with a refreshing hoppiness.  Overall: It was personally a bit underwhelming considering the reputation of this particular brew. It lacks character but is still a decent overall IPA.  EDIT: On reflection, the one characteristic that I appreciate is that the taste develops in your mouth, opening from a floral hoppiness that ends with a light refreshing citrus.

Fruit creeps in as well, but the hops remain in the forefront.  T - Taste is similar to how it smells. Hops hit you up front, but this is a fairly balanced DIPA with a malty middle. Alcohol warms at the end. There is a lingering oily, hoppy aftertaste.  M - A bit creamy compared to most DIPAs, due to the malt balance.  This is a prime example of what a balanced DIPA should be. Hops are present throughout, but never become dominantly bitter. In my opinion, the best smelling IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

(WOW) I had a buddy bring me some down from Pennsylvania. This has now become my favorite beer. Unreal at how hoppy this brew is. Living here in Alabama we are surrounded by pines and I thought the people from Dogfish Head had put one in my beer. Very piney, floral aroma that has some of the greatest hop smells ever bottled.  This beer is 9% abv and if you told me it was 5%abv, I would have believed that before seeing it actually is 9% abv. This brew does not drink like a 9% abv. It does however drink like the best DIPA you will ever have. It really is sick at how smooth this brew actually is. Be careful when drinking this one and remember it is 9%.

Some piney, grape-fruity and spicy hops, and lots of it. And of course it tastes like hops, kind of sweet and fruity hops, and a very mellow down toned alcohol taste lies under along with some balancing malts.

Taste - for a double, the citrus/pine do not over dominate, sweetness of the malts keeps things in check, exquisitely balanced.

Appearance: My assertive pour produced a hefty foamy caramel-speckled head that lasts and lasts and then some! Outrageous retention, great lacing and beautiful carbonation. Color is a deep-red caramel, reminds me of bourbon.  Smell: There are bitter hops, sugar, some coconut flakes. Very sweet, but not unpleasantly so. Also aromas of wet dog, creme brulee and booze as it warms up. Lemon peel, citrus. Pineapple juice spiked with rum/vodka.  Taste: Bread and biscuit, malt all around. Butterscotch, caramel, dessert. Toasted wheat bread with artisanal Chimay butter. Less hoppy and tropical than in the nose, never bitter. Very sweet and nourishing but delicious!  Mouthfeel: Medium body and low-but-adequate carbonation, full flavor. Thick and oily, sticks to your tongue and throat. Tingly-dry finish. Surprisingly smooth despite the heftiness, but also a tummy-warmer.  Overall: It is amazing how different this is from the bottled version (and even draft!). The bottle is sometimes harsh and too hop-forward (although I always love it very much). On the growler, the hops are mellow and there is more sweetness and an overall smooth feel that makes it outrageously drinkable. Outrageously, I say!

It smells of thick hop aroma not quite as sweet as other DIPAs I've tried - hints of piny and, if I'm not mistaken a tangy bit coming through. The taste complements the the smell nicely with a barely sweet hop flavor with a faint taste of fruitiness - The aftertaste is where the bitterness comes through but, once again, not as prominent as in other DIPAs I've had. Also doesn't taste quite as boozy as expected with the amount of alcohol present. The mouthfeel is smooth up front with a lot of bubbly feel afterwards from the carbonation.

S- Surprisingly, for an ipa (but not a dogfish head ipa) the malt defines the smell for me with sweet, almost milk-chocolatey notes. This is complemented nicely by a fruity, pineapple or grapefruit, hop aroma.  T- Up front there is a good mixture of sweet malt and fruity hop flavors, as detected in the nose. The middle is taken over by an overwhelming caramely malt sweetness. This is quickly followed by a long, slightly bitter, and dry finish.  M- The mouthfeel is really great in this beer, honestly, my favorite part of the brew. It coats the mouth completely with an almost creamy feel.  One of my Favorite dogfish Head beers... so far. and a great imperial ipa.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Dan3279,4.5,"This is my go to beer and one of my favorite IPA's. I try to make sure that I have a four pack in the fridge at all times. When I am out drinking it is my go to drink when I don't know what to get. The only reason I am reviewing this now is because I had it on draft at the DF Restaurant in Rehoboth and I had the beer through Randall.  The waitress brought the beer over to me in a pint glass with a great copper color with a few red hints and an inch and a half white head. The aroma was excellent the addition of the extra hops gave it a bold, fresh aroma with plenty of citrus and floral notes.  The taste was exceptional, it was like having the beer again for the first time. The taste was so fresh and crisp, it tasted as if I just bit into a hop. The aroma matches up with the flavors perfectly.  This beer was so easy to drink, clean and crisp, I could have easily sat at the bar and enjoyed several of these. If you are a fan of 90 min its worth it to stop by one of the DF restaurants and enjoy this beer hopped up with Randall!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S - Hops of the pine variety, a touch of sweetness is also noted, sort of a caramel/toffee flavor, giving this a nice balance.  T - Piney hops right upfront, but balanced by a nice caramel sweetness. Excellent balance  M - Prickly carbonation, and a nice smooth mouthfeel.  O - Very solid DIPA, not overly bitter, but the hops poke you and it is rounded off by the caramel sweetness.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Taste is very hoppy, with a nice amount of malts. It's very sweet, sugary tasting. Notes of warm cinnamon, and citrus as well.  Overall, a serious IPA for serious beer drinkers.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,alexhahn82,3.64,"A - Medium orange, not amber, not golden, very decent.  S - Smells of hops, pine and citrus. (yes the cliche smells, but not cliche for an east coast beer on the west coast!)  T/M - Taste is incredible, sweet with a nice bitterness. Mouthfeel is extremely flat, no effervescence and no head (but I will not hold it against the brew, I think this came off an old line, especially given the fact there are 60 brews on tap at this place!)  O - I think this is a damn good beer, and sense that I got a line pour and not a keg pour, hence the flatness. I would try it again  PP (Price Point) - $7 for a pint, not bad at all, and even though I dont like defending east coast beer, I know this came out of the lines and not out of the keg!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,XsoreXsubjectX,4.63,"Appearance: thin tuft of rich and sticky foam on top of a gorgeously rich amber body. Foam clings stringily to the glass, leaving stagnant white shapes. Certainly a beautiful color.  Smell - maybe it's me, but it seems the nose is on the weak and watery side. It's a cooling smell, carmely sweetness with prickles of sharp hops in the back, and a vague cheesy must coating the whole thing.  Taste/Aftertaste: my first thought was something like ""Oh god, please let this flavor stay in my mouth forever and never diminish."" A bottle later, I'm still convinced this would make me a happier person. The nose indicates a potential for intense hop power, but actually, carmel dominates almost altogether. Only after about two-thirds of the way does the static of hops surge up. The sweetness then comes back for the finish, along with bready yeast, leaving a pleasant, buttered apricot flavor, your taste buds still ringing from the hops.  Mouthfeel: Compared to other DIPA's, this is uniquely good. Quite smooth, with a pleasant lacing of tight, small, soft bubbles - just enough to remind you that it's a beer. Not english strong ale smooth, but damn smooth, and therefore highly drinkable. Thanks, 9% ABV!  Impression: This is a buttery, sweet beer which trades the genera's usual hop-pounding for a more balanced, desertlike approach. It is also unusually strong, which makes it a dangerous beer, considering it has a combination easy drinkability, delicious flavor, and high alcohol percentage. You see where I'm going here. This beer is best enjoyed with plenty of time to savor and respect it. Its flavor will immediately inform you that is not to be guzzled, but considered thoughtfully. I can't imagine enjoying this at a party - only alone or with a couple friends with lots of time to sit. This is an excellent brew, though DIPA usually denotes a hop explosion, and that's what I tend to prefer in these kinds of beers. This is an extremely successful malty version, and for those inclined to belgian beers who want something slightly hoppier in the summer, I recommend this.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,orangesol,4.1,"Reviewed from notes. Bottle poured into a Duvel tulip glass.  A - Pours deep amber orange with a thick pillow of one and a half finger tall head leaving light rings of lacing down the glass.  S - Smells of strong caramel malt sweetness, dulled citric hops, pine, and some faded out citric fruit. This one appears to be a bit old...  T - Starts off with a quick burst of piney hops quickly giving way to a mix of strong caramel malt sweetness and dulled citric fruit. Finish is a mix of caramel sweetness and hop bitterness, lingering for some time. I love 90min. but this bottle is just a bit past it's prime.  M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Full bodied with a mix of sweetness and bitterness in the finish.  O - I have always enjoyed this beer. It is very well rounded and has all the qualities I look for in a hoppy beer. I just wish more stores would stop selling these older bottles as it never does this beer justice.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,kemoarps,4.12,"To preface: I am not the biggest IPA fan, and not super big on hops. I like to think that I can maintain an objective sense, however. ALSO, this particular bottle has been aged quite a bit, so that undoubtedly affects its characteristics in distinctive ways.  The beer pours a pretty little amber ditty, with a mostly white head, leaving nice lacing down the sides  The head gives a good heads up (weak pun weakly intended) as to the sweetness that will follow, which surprised me somewhat. It's almost flowery, but don't mistake that for a bad thing. There are some faint caramel and citrus notes as well.  The taste follows the nose pretty well, and gives a story to the undergirding outline of the smell. The floral sweetness definitely comes to the front, while the slight caramel toastiness comes through in the second act. The citrus notes remain light, and the bitter hoppiness shines through in the 3rd and final act.  For an IPA this beer was almost creamier than I ever expected. Small bubbles, but light carbonation. Much smoother than I anticipated as well.  As I mentioned up top, I don't usually go for IPAs or beers with a more pronounced hop profile, but this beer was unequivocally tasty. I applause Dogfish Head for their craftwork and understand why my sister (and just about everyone else for that matter) heap praise upon the brewery. WELL worth checking out, even if you're not usually a fan of the style",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,brown2cu,4.55,"A: Pours a hazy dark brown with a small layer of foam; sticky lacing coats the side of the glass.  S:Hops, sweet malt, with an underlying bit of alcohol.  T: Damn, Dogfish Head makes a damn fine brew! Incredibly sweet but with plenty of hop bitterness to satisfy the most staunch hop head. The alcohol is noticeable but not overwhelming. Well done and nicely rounded, I really do not know how the taste could be improved.  MF: Extremely low carbonation; Goes down thick and sticky. Make a joke about that!  O: Quality shit here well worth the money spent.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,vrushing88,4.92,"Poured this from a 12 ounce bottle into a snifter.  Poured a slightly cloudy, copper-red tint, with a thin head.  A heavy malty-hoppy aroma fills the glass, with notes of alcohol and citrusy fruit, and a delicate note of apple.  It has a lightly sweet, apple/citrus presence, with plenty of relaxed hops, and full flavor malts. The hops really bring this beer to life. They break down into a wonderful sweet citrus flavor, with all relaxed hop flavor.  The carbonation in this beer is very present. It isn't over-carbonated, but very sharp and crisp. If your pallet is delicate, this may be slightly harsh, but overall refreshing.  Overall, this may be the best I.P.A. readily available to the general public.

10099,2093,rawfish,4.08,"Poured from bottle to globe glass. Rusty orange hue, with surprising clarity and a constant stream of bubbles rising to the top. Vigorous pour nest 3 fingers of eggshell head, incredibly creamy and brilliant retention that settles into no less than a half inch cap. Lacing is a bit thin in steaks here and there but the froth looks very dense so it's not surprising.  Smell is a bit darker than I imagined and you need to get your nose in it with sweet bread and biscuit malts hidden beneath a layer of blood orange and grapefruit hops that lays down pungent and deep, well done.  English malt really puts down a solid and rich bready base for this beer. Malts balance a variety of hop flavor and a bitterness that begins early, not intense but steady through the entire drink. Grapefruit flavors all the way through a bit of orange but ranging from juice to pith in a slightly tart ending as bitterness rises. Malts certainly balance this one out well but win over as the alcohol is very well hidden and leaves a little sticky feeling.  Well carbonated and an average DIPA body. Alcohol well hidden with a small sticky feel at the end. Beautiful creamy mouthfeel through the optimal carbonation.  I finally found the DFH beer that makes me go wow. 90 minute is a balanced DIPA that delivers in all the right spots and feels great over the palate while you sip.

10099,2093,mvforegonian,4.35,Dogfish Head never disappoints.  An Imperial IPA featuring a constant 90-minute hop addition. It's wonderfully balanced by a ridiculous amount of English Barley. Each tank is dry hopped for extra amounts of delight!  I think I was most impressed with the rich mouthfeel of this brew. the taste is sweet and hoppy at the same time.

10099,2093,BarryMFBurton,4.38,"Quick plug: if you haven’t started trading, DO IT! This right here is the fruit of my first: Dogfish Head 90 Minute. I’ve heard so much about this brewery, and my interest peaked after watching Beer Wars. I loved that movie, love IPA’s, and love the rare opportunity to try this while here in the Midwest! Let’s hope this one lives up to my excitement…  Thanks to 1Adam12 for the great trading experience.  A: Rusty, golden-orange color flows from the bottle as I pour purposefully. The head – so creamy it looks like milk at times – pushes up from the top of the brew with force. It’s contained, though, and only reaches approximately one-and-a-half fingers. It scales back in due time, but never reaches anything less than half an inch of velvety goodness (bubbles rising from the bottom to keep it fresh). Superb in every way.  S: Huge hops to start with, almost salty at times. But it’s pleasant, like ocean water. Embedded in there are some piney notes, and floral undertones. I’m sensing a big malt character as well, presenting itself with caramel syrup and roasted barley. No detectable yeast, as of yet. For me, the nose is predominantly showing signs of a smoked quality I wasn’t anticipating. I’m intrigued now, more than ever.  T: As per the nose, smoky and sweet in the front end. Caramel, silky vanilla syrup, and a novel nuttyness are all equal parts of this unique palate. Is it possible? The hops coming in at the back end of an IPA, instead of dominating the palate as a whole? Well, Dogfish Head did it. The hops are second-in-command to the sweet malts, making the palate bitter only on the underside. It’s a welcome change. Not every IPA has to also be labeled as a hop-forward mouth-dryer, and I’m glad this isn’t. The hops are the most balanced that I’ve ever had in an IPA, sending drinkability through the roof. Floral backdrops work to hold up a sizeable piney flavor as the hops extend to the end of the aftertaste. Also muddled about in the endgame are some weak yeasts, though they do nothing but balance the salty hops to leave a better finish. An interesting take on the India Pale Ale.  M: Smooth and creamy. It serves only to add to the exquisite smoothness of the palate. Perfect execution here.  O: I really, really like this beer. Seriously, by the end of it, I was shaking my only bottle to get the last drops out. At times, it was a bit syrupy, I’ll admit that. But that’s the only thing keeping it from a perfect score. After having this, I can say that I would definitely love to get to know Dogfish Head more; a lot more. Now, if only I were closer to Delaware…  EDIT: After some thought, I liked this beer and Founders Double Trouble so much that I changed my Favorite Style from Russian Imperial Stout to American Double/Imperial IPA.

Brilliant orange/amber clear pour, huge sudsy head, clings like glue to the glass for the entire drink...this is what a beer should look like.  Nice blend of citrus hops and sweet caramel/toffee malt in the scent. A little bit o'honey as well. Not overpowering, but fresh and enticing.  Immediate taste of oily hops upon first sip, followed by some spicyness I can't really place, then sweet malt. The only thing that really throws the taste for me is the dryness. It's certainly creamy and smooth, especially for such a big beer...but that dryness throws off the flavor just a bit.  Overall, this beer is very nice. Certainly not a hop bomb though.

The pack states that it's ""perhaps the best IPA in America"" and judging by the taste I'd agree.  As for appearance the color when poured is amber. There is not that much head on the beer but as I drink it there's a fair amount of carbonation resulting in a good mouthfeel.  It's not overly bitter and does have a hint of sweetness which most IPAs lack. The smell is fairly sweet before the first sip as well.

10099,2093,Lauthaha,4.47,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a wine glass.  Appearance: Beer pours an amber color with a tendency towards gold. Very minimal carbonation visible through the glass, but a fairly decent head presents itself. Starting at about two fingers and working itself down to a very fine mist on the surface of the beer, the ecru head leaves minimal lacing, but holds plenty of bubbly goodness.  Smell: Splendid! Malt is just beautiful; butterscotch or toffee malt type thing, lightly roasted. Within that is a very mellow hop profile of fruity bitterness, and a warming amount of alcohol to the nose.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Wildness...awesome. The malt is definitely the base of this brew, some toffee sweetness with a gentle toastiness. Hops are a beautiful citrus/apple kind of flavor, and the alcohol is very similar to the nose; warming, but not overpowering. Beer is bubbly the whole time, but not over-carbonated by any means. Aftertaste is a woody kind of bitter, very pleasant. Well suited to dark chocolate pairings.  Overall: Very, very good. Definitely worth a try, even if you aren't an Imperial IPA fan; there's a lot going on here with the taste, and I'm sure I only picked up on bits and pieces of it.

10099,2093,BestOfBatonRouge,4.53,On a recent business trip I was ecstatic to see this beer on tap at the Hyatt Regency in Atlanta. In Louisiana we don’t have it and with the introduction of the television series I’ve wanted it. I immediately ordered it. It pours a nice clear orange with about 3/4 inch of foam in a tall tulip glass. The carbonation presents very well balanced and it looks very tasty. I was very excited at just the visual presentation which is of course where we all first taste our beer.  First impression on taste was far less harsh in bitter than I’ve come to expect from American made IPA’s. I had a similar impression when I first had the Samuel Smith IPA in that it was far less harsh bitter than I expected. At 90 IBU’s in 90 minute versus 45 IBU’s in the Samuel Smith you can see the Dogfish methods in hopping are really great. A nice mellow citrus and malt taste that goes down really smooth. You definitely don’t get the impression that it has big alcohol in it. Easily one of the most enjoyable IPA experiences I’ve had.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,Swedes21,4.12,"Appearance - pours a gorgeous clear copper colour, real nice 2 finger head with about 1 finger lasting power. there is some nice lacing as well good carbonation in the glass.  Smell - real delight! getting some hops and pine right away, along with a hint of sweetness. a nice malt blend near the end along with a slight earth/flower smell. there is also some citrus blended into all the smells.  Taste - very dominating beer, some good malts really come through in the taste. you get the hops combined with the citrus for a little bitterness. there is a nice lasting taste to this beer as well, overall its very well balanced.  Mouthfeel - real strong bitterness added ,actually was able to pick up some alcohol in the mouthfeel. there is some good weight in the mouth as well. flavours are enhanced.  Overall - very good tasting but prolly a little too much. there is some real good balance and design, but not sure the focus was enough on the IPA. this is a true DIPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Whobody,4.55,"A - nice golden color with a decent foam on top. Maybe one fingers width. Bubble rising from bottom of glass showing consistent carbonation.  S- Excelent hop aroma. I'm getting plenty of citrus smell maybe grapefruit. Lots of floral  T- wow this tastes good. I'm tasting some caramel, lots of bitterness from the hops , nice and dry + sweet. Not too malty. The hops just dominate. I'm not detecting the alcohol as much as I thought I would.  M- Not sure how to describe, Just not much too it aside from bitterness. A little bit silky. Very easy to drink if you're a hophead!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Treebs,4.15,"Poured from 12oz. bottle into my Founders snifter.  A: Pours a deep amber color with a creamsicle head with great retention. Slowly leaving revealing a nice lace. Very carbonated on sight.  S: Sweet citrus hops, light fruit. Malted barely throughout the middle and sweet little miniature kick of a tight booze all the way in the back, but you have to dig for it.  T: Bitter hops with a sour citrus through out. Strong barley in the middle with the slightest burn on the back end.  M: Light to medium body. Prickly mouth feel with a carbonation that can be a little overpowering at the beginning, but tones down rather nicely.  O: Very nice DIPA and the taste doesn't fall very far off from the smell. I enjoyed it very much.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,ckollias,4.47,"Enjoyed this beer @ Dogfish head Alehouse in Gaithersburg  A: Pours a pale-orangish head with a one-finger, creamy, white head that lingers for a while.  S: Wow – strong hops hits you like a punch to the face.  T: Very strong hoppy flavor fills you mouth at first. An interesting aggressive blend of malts and hops. Tastes of caramels, coconuts, pine, and oils. The alcohol is present here – but it is blended in perfectly with the hops and malts. This beer is in great balance.  M: Full and rich body and medium carbonation.  O: A great imperial IPA. Enjoyed this one from first sip to last.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,MonkeymooTJ,3.15,Appearance:  Orange-copper-to red from bottom to the top of the glass. Thin small head quickly disappeared so dont blink. Lots of bubbles floated to the top  Smell:  Herbal and grassy hops with a heavy caramel malt aroma present  Taste:  Moderate bitterness hits up front. Grassy hops are detected followed by a balance of sweet malt. Doesnt at all taste like a hop-centric DIPA  Mouthfeel:  Fairly heavy body with a low to moderate carbonation level. A bit of spice and alcohol burn is left on the tongue  Overall:  Decent. I was expecting much more bitterness as the label boasts about the 90 min hop additions and dry hopping etc. Head stability was lacking a bit and it was a little too sweet for a DIPA in my opinion,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,cbriggz,4.33,Def one of my favorite beers. Typically i dont review them due to lack of time but apparently after almost 3 years on this sight and many of trades i need more beer karma to trade beer(crazy in my opinion). Anyway beer poured into a Dogfish head glass with a small head great smell and drinks wonderfully. By far one of if not there best beer!!!!,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,kdiggidy,4.18,"A - an aggressive pour became too aggressive very quickly as an enormous head formed. Tons of lacing left on the upper glass by the couple inches of foam. S - slight citrus/pine notes, but not as aromatic as I would've hoped for. T - the taste is way less hoppy than I would like. I realize the perceived bitterness isn't going to be real high, but it seems way more malty than I remember, especially since it was bottled 4/10/11. Taste is somewhat sweet with a touch of bitterness on the back end. M - I really enjoy this part of 90 min. Almost creamy, and very smooth. The type of beer I could drink a few of in a row for sure. O - this is one of those beers that I really enjoy from time to time, and can even go multiples in a session, but it isn't on the daily menu. Even after seeing this fresh of a 4 pack at my local shop, I only bought one bottle. Perhaps a bit overpriced, especially for a year-round, but well worth it every time and again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,portia99,3.91,"12oz bottle (bottled on 3/9/11) poured into a Dogfish Head signature glass. Haven't had this one in a long time - will be interesting to see if it lives up to my distant memories.  A - An aggressive pour that was curtailed just in time for the glass to contain the full contents of liquid and head yields a crystal clear pale amber color with about 3 fingers of fluffy, dense off white foam. Staying power is good - the foam very slowly dies over several minutes and leaves loads of sticky spiderwebbed lacing on the glass.  S - Good amount of hops here...but not as much as I'd expected or hoped for. Combination of hop aromas are there though - mostly citrusy with good grapefruit notes and some pineapple mixed in with a touch of pine also. I'm really noticing an overall earthines to this beer. Lots of dirt-like aromas come thru, giving a bit of a dry aroma mixed with some bready and biscuity aspects mixed in. Wanted to get blown away with hop aroma, but didn't - still a good smelling beer.  T - Sweet, malty, caramelly at the base. Tropical fruits layered on top with pineapple taking the lead and followed by the grapefruit. Sugary, maltose sweetness, caramel and toffee from beginning to end. Hop bitterness really doesn't appear with any force until pretty much the swallow but comes and goes quickly. The sweetness of this one is a bit on the cloying side and has a bit of a honey-like aspect, but more than anything gives the maltose based under-attenuated flavor (think sampling a big DIPA wort before being fermented - exaggerated a bit) with lots of residual sugars left behind.  M - Medium/full bodied with a somewhat light and creamy carbonation. Overall sweetness, but certainly no lack of hops - East coast IPA balanced.  O - Still good, but doesn't quite live up to the memories. I prefer the more hop forward/hop bomb DIPA's in the west coast style. This is still pretty damn good, but can't quite live up to my hopes and dreams for what it could be.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,jayhawk73,3.95,"A- Golden color w/ an off white head that disappears quickly. Lacing and carbonation are fairly weak. I'm wondering if this is an older bottle.  S- Very bitter, w/ fruit coming through and some malt.  T- Definitely hops w/ fruit, malt coming through. Alcohol is not completely masked, but I actually enjoy that. Not as smooth as on draft.  M- Bitter, w/ a slight smoothness that comes through. Slight alcohol burn as well. This is the weak point of this beer for me.  O- Good solid beer. Not quite in the top tier of IPA's, but a good brew nonetheless. I actually like this one WAY better on draft than out of the bottle.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,ranger7,3.95,"A - Nice thick head of white. Bright and clear amber, very nice and inviting.  S - Very hoppy. A perfumy hint mixed with some floral and citrus scents.  T - Again, very hoppy. The hops dominate the flavor, a bit much in my opinion.  M - Medium carbonation and smooth taste. Easy to drink (beware 9% ABV). Hops.  Summary - I wouldn’t say this was my favorite of the Dogfish Head brand. Personally, I prefer the 60 Minute variant over this (less hoppy, more even taste). Having said that, I had this beer recommended to me while trying the fish and chips at the Holy Grail Pub in Plano, and I must say that it was a terrific combo. Having anything (like the tartar sauce) to even out the overload of hops significantly helps.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,BelgiumBill,4.35,"Here's my disclaimer - I'm not a hophead and prefer a good creamy breakfast or milk stout. I've had Hop Devil and Stone Ruination a few years ago and I think I still am tasting the hops.  On to this 90 min IPA...  Poured it into a Sam Adams glass a nice golden, amber, orange hued and lightly hazy color. It gave a 1 inch off white creamy head which produced nice lacing throughout.  I was expecting a piney crisp nose. What I got was a sweet butterscotch and some light tangerine. I was starting to think I was in for something different.  It had an interesting hoppy sweetness. Citrus, creamy, caramel butter popcorn? The hops were very much there but very well integrated into the flavor profile. I got a little hop bitter on the side of the tongue, but no more (and maybe less) than a good Russian Stout. Nice long finish where the hops hung around as the rest faded. I can't believe it's 9% ABV - it wasn't at all noticeable.  Great rich, velvety, creamy in the mouth and great balance.  This is very drinkable and I will get this again. Great beer which will bring me back to IPAs and I will use this to judge others by.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,WankelEngine,4.57,Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass  A: Pours a moderately hazy burnt amber color. There is a lot of visible carbonation and a just off-white head with solid retention. Fairly thick layered lacing  S: Smells of warm tropical fruits and citrus hops. There is a light pine/herbal scent behind this that is balanced by some caramel malt.  T: The taste is less fruity than the smell but still very hoppy. The pine flavor comes through much more strongly here than it does in the smell. The citrus flavor persists though it’s hard to taste most of the other tropical fruits from the smell. What surprises me most is the strength of the malt flavor. This might be the most malty IPA I’ve ever had. It balances the hops really well.  M: The mouthfeel is fairly thin with a decent amount of carbonation. I can feel the alcohol but it’s moderate.  O: One of the most balanced IPA’s I’ve ever had. The caramel malts make the potent hops flavor very drinkable.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,OrangeAmps,4.5,"Pours out of 12 oz bottle into a cloudy glowing copper colored beer with a creamy white head that laces well and appropriate carbonation for this style.  One of my favorite IPAs for sure. And also one of the most drinkable IPAs i have yet to consume.  Smells of malts, citrusy hops, and alcohol. The smell is intense, as if to suggest lots of booze, but the booze isnt very apparent on the taste.  The taste is exceedingly well blended. the balance of citrus hops and booze and malts is striking, and almost refreshing.  The mouthfeel is boisterous, but in a very pleasing way.  This is such a great beer and im glad its very widely available. One of the few IPAs i get excited about drinking.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,bigrzman,4.57,"Pours out of 12 oz bottle into a cloudy glowing copper colored beer with a creamy white head that laces well and appropriate carbonation for this style.  Smells of rich fruity malts, citrusy hops, alcohol, and grain. This smells potent.  Taste is a very well blended balance of citrusy and earthy hops much better than most American IPAs. Most American IPAs will have dish soap citrusy taste but this eliminates that. After the hop blast a delicious fruited bread taste and grains. It finishes out with a hoppy citrus blast in the back booyah!  Mouthfeel is hop assertive, astringent, and drying.

The aged 90 min. was a lot smoother and reminiscent of barleywines. Their look was similar in color, but the nose and mouthfeel were almost completely different.

Strong, and oh-so-alluring!  Flavor is sour grapefruit...again, strong. Distinctive. A real kicker here, and a damned fine IPA. It's a potent 9%, so beware of this one, as it always seems to switch the lights out for me.

10099,2093,xnicknj,3.85,"on tap at tria in philly  Pours a brilliant burnt orange color with bright golden and cherry hues. A thinner beige head fades slowly leaving curtains of lacing on the glass.  Scents of pungent hops with intense citrus and peel. Piny resin and some richer caramel sweetness. Scents of booze as well.  Strong hoppiness right up front with pine and citrus which come together nicely. Bitter with biting grapefruit and resiny stickiness. Some fruit sweetness on top of a heavier malted backbone with toasted bread and caramel. Finishes with a strong hit of alcohol and bitter, lingering hops.  Medium bodied, decent carbonation, dry and lingering on the tongue, slight creaminess at points.

10099,2093,cjacobsen,4.09,"11.16.09 bottle poured in a snifter  (A) Butterscotch and honey colored pour. Slight haze to it, but far from opaque. Great head retention and starts with a half inch, fluffy off white head to it.  (S) Smells a little of weak sweet honey, some ale yeast, and of course, hops. The light malts give it a lighter nose. Has a slight spicy and floral smell to it.  (T) The taste is sweet with a sugary, caramel flavor that starts mid taste and follows through to the end. The hops are subdued and faded a decent amount, but not gone. The bitterness is has gone way down.  (M) Still well carbonated. Has that carbonation bite to your tongue. Still a full bodied beer but not overly heavy or chewy.  (O) It's not what you would normally expect from a fresh 90 Min IPA. It drinks more like a weak barley wine. It's quite sweet, but a sugary sweet.  Most people hold on to 120 Minute, but haven't heard much about people aging 90 Minute so I figured why not. Not bad. Got another one of these in the cellar, so it will be interesting to see how this ages for another year.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,zeledonia,4.18,"Bottled 3 Feb 2011. Not ideal for an IPA, but I don't know much about how well this one holds up over time.  Pours a clear coppery orange with a massive almost-white head that recedes very slowly and leaves a shocking amount of lacing. Gorgeous.  Smell is fruity, floral, citrusy hops all the way. Grapefruit, apricots, and pineapple. Yum. I get no sharpness or alcohol in the nose at all, which is surprising for such a hoppy high-ABV beer.  Taste is good, but not amazing. Not as much in there as I'd expected. Starts out rather malty but without a ton of flavor - a kind of bland wheat with a touch of sweetness - before the hops kick in. The hop flavor, which is primarily citrus, comes in later, and slowly shifts from lemon to grapefruit to a smooth lingering enjoyable bitterness. There's not as much hop potency, and not as much complexity, to the flavor as I'd like. That said, it's still pretty darn tasty.  Mouthfeel is good. Medium-bodied, a little light on the carbonation.  This is a very good beer. I like it. But I find it rather innocuous. I want it to be either bigger, or better, or both. It doesn't bowl me over with hoppiness, and it doesn't impress me with balanced flavors. So I put it above-average. Wonder how much of that has to do with this being a 3-month old bottle. Hoping to try it fresher sometime soon.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,SuperSpy,4.21,"Poured from a brown 12oz bottle (no freshness date) into a pint glass. The beer is a hazy orange-copper with what is possibly the greatest head in the history of beer. This foam is thick, but not so thick that you can't get to the beer. It stays around forever, and it sticks to everything. This is an absolutely beautiful beer.  There is a robust amount of oily hops in the smell. The aroma is very herbal and fruity with some hidden malt sweetness.  Thick and smooth. The hop flavor is big from beginning to end. It's oily, earthy and mildly herbal. There is also plenty of biscuit like flavors from the malt in the background, but it's the hops that take the show.

Pours a clear orange-brown with a nice foamy off-white head, much like it's brother beer, but a bit lighter. Floral aroma, with pine and citrus. Smooth, mild and pleasant on the palate, with the notes of the aroma following right through in the taste. Citrus hops complimented just right with sweet malts, with a little bit of sugar or light caramel taste coming through. Not too strong in the hop department for an imperial IPA.

10099,2093,BasementBer,3.56,"A: Possibly the clearest IPA I have seen! Absolutely see-through amber, possibly from the 90 minute boil or just the knockdown times in the fermenter that really give this beer a sexy look. Good head, mild lacing.  S: This maltyness. The citrus and floral are not in full force as I would expect them but they are present.  T: I was disappointed here. Im getting more malt than anything. I want the hops here! The nose is burnt caramel, the middle is thick roast and the finish is boozy.  M: The lack of hops for the style makes the pockets more or less inattentive to the bittering, the boozy aftertaste of the 9% abv is definitely what leaves you.  D: Doesn't hit the mark for the me in the style category.

S: Pine, floral notes, light citrus, and a little booze. The maltiness isn't very strong in the nose.  T: Caramel malts, mild floral hoppiness, and juicy citrus; it is delicious and the epitome of and East Coast IPA.  M: It has medium body thickness with average carbonation.  O: This is wonderful.

TASTE: Caramel is what came through the strongest for me. Some floral and hoppy notes are detectable as well, but this is a sweet beer.  MOUTHFEEL: An excellent feeling beer, light and tingly and easy-drinking. If I didn't know any better I would have no clue I was drinking a 9%er.  OVERALL: Good beer, but not great.

For my taste it is not a traditional Imperial IPA which would provide a citrus smell and more hops but that isn't a bad thing. It's a full bodied beer which relies more heavily on its malts than hops. The end result is more of a dark brown sugar flavor which provides a very enjoyable sweetness.

The head continues to sustain throughout.  S - I can smell it from quite a ways, which I always like in a beer. The smell is of hops, pure and simple. A bit of fruit, a bit of piney.  T - Taste is a slightly muted version of the smell. The alcohol is present, but not overwhelming at all. The hops are slightly juicy, slightly piney. Delicious beer.

A big foaming off-white head that just leaves the most magnificent lacing down the glass.  An incredibly aromatic aroma full of citrus hops and caramel malts. I wasn't expecting this. It's far more ""West Coast"" than I ever would have imagined. This nose is nearly perfect. It's splendidly, pungently full of citrus. There's an aroma of pineapple in here as well that I pick up, but even with all the citrus, the nose isn't too sweet at all.  The taste follows in the West Coast tradition of highly bitter, highly citrus-forward DIPAs. It's an easy drinking array of high bitterness, pungent and powerful hops, and plenty of caramel maltiness to back up the whole thing.  Thick and luscious mouthfeel, ample carbonation, excellent.  This is a truly fantastic DIPA. I regret not picking this up until now. I always expected, apparently undeservingly so, a very malt-forward DIPA, and being the West Coast DIPA lover that I am, I always thought this beer wasn't for me, but this beer ranks as one of my favorites!

However, the bitterness lacks the leafy quality that many bitter hops impart, nor is it peppery. It is a bit resinous, but otherwise, the bitterness seems quite pure, which I find much more pleasing than the piney bitterness I have to endure in most IPAs.

Grapefruit, pineapple, caramel, and other fruity aromas come at me strongest. Grass, citrus rind, and biscuit come out weaker, but present. Nice and complex.  T: Hop taste came out stronger than the aroma led me to believe... nice though. Pleasant hoppy bitterness nicely balanced by the malty sweetness. Alcohol comes through also... not overly strong, but present. I really like the hop flavors in this... very present, but so nicely balanced that they don't make you focus strictly on the bitterness.

Taste- Is bitter on the palate and is dominated by strong pine and hop flavours, Citrus grapefruit flavours eventually come through and just like the smell it finishes with a nice sweet caramel malt taste.  Mouthfeel- Very good carbonation, light-medium bodied IPA, crisp and refreshing although it is a little bitter, but has good drinkability.  Overall- Delivered on all aspects when searching for a good American double IPA. The hops smack you right in the face, but balanced with that nice floral and citrusy taste that finishes sweet. A very quality brew delivered from a very quality brewery, would definitely drink it again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,gdfullwv,4.5,"My buddy brought me back a growler of 90 Minute IPA. I have always liked this beer, but I can't believe the difference a FRESH batch makes.  The aroma has a refreshing hops feel... the overall taste has a nice hoppy flavor without being over powering.. The body was just a tad heavy for an IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Sensaray,4.5,From notes  Pours orange amber with slowly dissipating off white head  Hops to the nose are very present Some tropical flavors almost like peach are there.  Delicious malts with a great tasting sweet caramel balance with citrus/pine hops. The taste is so good.  Medium mouthfeel buts its the heavy end of medium. Smooth drinkable carbonation.  This is balanced through the finish with a nice bitter yet sweet and refreshing aftertaste. I only got 1 bottle and I wanted to get a 4 pack after drinking that 1. Delicious,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,techfed87,4.17,"Poured from a bottle into a standard tulip glass. Has a nice frothy head. Color is a shade of mid-amber. Smell immediately gives off the one characteristic that I know makes a good IPA: grapefruit. Every great IPA that I've tried has smelled in some part of grapefruit through their hop profile. This is no exception.  First sip has that characteristically-oily hops flavor. No DIPA can get away with any hop profile that doesn't have this to some extent. This is a big beer, to anyone's standards. Mouthfeel is rewarding, as is the accompanying aftertaste.  A very good beer. Period.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,bierschmecktgut,3.69,"Poured from bottle into pint glass.  Poured a clear orange/amber with white head that stayed small throughout. Lacing was spotty on the sides. Rising carbonation was minimal.  Smell was what I would expect on such a high IPA. Pine & grass popped out ahead of the citrusy zing. A sweet malt aroma is there but had trouble separating from the citrus. Taking a shot and saying aroma hops are Cascade.  I was expecting an immediate bitterness or alcohol taste up front but bitterness led right into a nice sweet taste which finished pretty balanced. For 9% I thought there would be some type of heat but was tame. The warming feeling came just towards the end of the pint.  Slightly medium body that was dry and finished fairly crisp. It did however have a powdery feel, maybe a tingle from the carbonation.  I would definitely recommend this to friends looking for a high octane brew without the typical alcohol burn or palette destroyer you might get in the 10% range.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,patreely12,4.42,"12 oz bottle poured into a snifter.  A - clear copper tinted amber. one inch of white head dissolves to a thin film. good amount of carbonation and lacing all the way down the glass. very clean and appealing.  S - fairly complex aromas. I get some strong sweet malts, more so than the hops, which is unexpected for a beer claiming so much hop presence (not a bad thing though). the nose is further sweetened by hints of honey and citrusy apricot or grapefruit. the floral hops are there but are overshadowed by the malts. there is also a faint hint of alcohol.  T/M - like the nose the flavors are complex. the majority of the malt flavor is in the front end while the dry, bitter hops take up the back end. the malts and hops are both very strong and developed, but they balance each other nicely. the honey and citrus hints help complement the sweetness of the malts. there is also a healthy amount of warming alcohol presence. sticky, dry mouthfeel. light-medium bodied with a high amount of carbonation.  Overall this is a great beer. DFH 90 min fully lived up to my expectations. if you love IPAs with strong flavor character you definitely have to try this, it's a bit pricey for a 4 pack but it's worth it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,CrookedStill,3.77,"Bottled 1/19/11  Golden amber with a dense foamy head that last a few minutes before slowly settling, laces the glass nicely.  Floral, slightly herbal notes upfront. There's a sweetness in the background that compliments the floral aspect very well. Not much, if any, noticeable bitterness.  Caramel sweetness is very dominate, not cloying, but very evident and upfront. The hops really plays second fiddle to the malts here. You know they're there but they're muted behind the volume of the malt. What's really surprising is the lack of alcohol. If 9% wasn't printed on the bottle, I wouldn't believe it. There's just a hint of an alcohol bite at the very end but increases as it warms.  I really enjoyed the body of the 90 Minute over the 60. The thicker, more full body with a low/medium amount of carbonation that really lets the sweetness come through.  This beer really picks up where the 60 left off yet still falls a bit short in some areas. Mainly the lack of an aggressive hop presence one would expect from a beer that had a ""constant 90-minute hop addition."" As a whole, like the 60 Minute, it is a very solid and respectable beer that is easily enjoyable. No small feat considering the high ABV. While the 60 left me wanting more in the way of a more full body, the 90 left me wanting a more assertive hop presence. I really enjoyed this beer and maybe I'm being a bit too hard on it. I guess what it boils down to is would I recommend this beer to friend? I would, without a doubt.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

T: Rich grassy hop flavor with a good amount of bitterness. Pine notes, some citrus. Really well balanced.  M: Creamy, thick, and heavy. Sticky, coats the mouth. Great consistency.

10099,2093,colforbin73,4.2,"up front i find this beer very aggressive... serious bitterness right off the bat accompanied by a palpable booziness. the middle of the palate and back of the tongue get something way more complex -- with a resiny, piney hop bitterness and sweet overtones of maybe... honey.  pours a deep amber honey color and foams up nicely for a dipa, leaves decent lacing on the glass as well. the mouthfeel is solid, as would be evidenced by the ample lacing.... and general good froth.  i am on the fence about going over a 4 overall -- in then end -- it is super bitter, and i would only ever want one every once in a while. excellent beer regardless.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,gkunkle,3.83,"Although I enjoyed this beer, I feel that my expectations for an IPA represent something much different being that I am from the west coast. 90 minute pours an amber color with a one finger off white head, decent head and retention for a beer at 9% ABV. Alcohol comes through strongly in the most alongside the hops and caramel malt. I found myself craving a heavy hand of hops in the taste, this IIPA is certainly much more balanced than others, with a more notable addition of caramel malt. Mouthfeel was decent. Overall, a good beer, but I'll stick with my west coast IPAs.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,TheWhiskerReview,4.43,"Pours a hazy coppered-orange with a frothy, dense 2 finger off white head which reduces to a constant ring with nice lacing.  Nose has an intense piney character with more hoppy notes of orange and ripe papaya. There's a bit of chalky yeast, some estery apricot and loads of dark wildflower honey. The maltiness on this is pretty sizable.  Full-bodied palate tastes like a caramel soaked pine cone with an ample and perfectly executed bitterness- more aromas of light roast coffee, fresh grass. Again, though, the malt is almost big enough here to be equal to the hops. The brew starts oily and finishes incredibly sticky and resinous with lingering flavors of toffee and pine.  It's been a while since I've had this so I decided to give it a re-review. I've heard a lot of people lately bash this a little because it's 'too sweet' in their opinion, but it's the bigger maltiness that actually makes me like this more. After re-tasting this, I can really appreciate this as what it seems to be: not a purely American DIPA, but as an imperial American take on an English IPA. And I still think it's one of the best brews out there.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,beerinmorning,3.93,"Let's cut right to it. I really like a good stout, mainly an imperial stout or something with some chew to it.  When I drink an IPA, I expect a clean, dry, almost thin beer. And that's okay. This beer, however, has so much body, that you can't help but love it.  Not as bitter as many IPAs. In fact, it's fairly sweet, which shouldn't be a surprise with a 9% ABV. To get you that type of ABV, you have to use ample malt. I'll be damned, though, if the hops don't balance this perfectly.  It seems almost odd to think of this as an IPA, as the bitterness is clearly not there. More like an English ale, with a pleasant, scotchy alcohol-laced finish.  It's almost a cliche at this point, but Dogfish Head knocks it out of the park again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Kelly88,3.88,"Had on tap at the Cock and Bull and they even serve this 9% beer in an imperial pint.  A- dark burnt copper bordering on brown. Whitish head tops this dark double ipa that is remaining as a thin cap. Blood spatter lace is random on the glass.  S- sweet fruit like cherries hit the nostrils along with a shot of alcohol. Some bread is in there as well.  T- very sweet flavor at first,not sure if its hops or malts, I think malts. Then juicy citrus hops hang from a pine tree as It tickles the tongue. Alcohol is barely noticeable as it combines with the hop bite on the swallow.  M- medium feel with the illusion of medium carbonation (due to the hop bitterness ) . Feels good for 9% . The hop bite is enjoyable and without It the beer would be to heavy.  Overall a different take on the double ipa. Very sweet malts backed by sweet hops. Made so well that the sweetness is not overbearing. Dark for an ipa but a looker. Always a treat to drink this beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,richkrull,4.82,"Poured into a snifter glass a transparent amber color with a good amount of slightly off-white head on it. Very good lacing to it as well. Smell is definitely hoppy with some caramel notes. Taste is very well balanced with some lightly roasted malts up front and a slight bitter hop finish. Not nearly as bitter as I thought it would be. Also does not have any alcohol taste despite being 9% ABV. Very good mouthfeel, light and goes down dangerously easy. I really enjoyed this beer and am very glad I got a chance to try it before it leaves Wisconsin.

10099,2093,hiku7,4.48,"12oz bottle poured into a tulip glass.  A - Pours a beautiful clear deep amber with tiny bubbles rising immediately apparent. Thick creamy off-white long-lasting head. Big splotchy sticky lacing followed the beer in its descent down the glass.  S - A strong fruitiness, possibly strawberries, is the dominant scent, with a bit of piney hops. An indistinct maltiness is also noticeable.  T - Up front malty sweetness is mild followed by an also mild lingering hop bitterness. Overall, a very balanced and laid-back kind of flavor that was not what I was expecting, being used to west coast style hop bombs in the IIPA realm. Sweetness is apparent at first but quickly fades to a somewhat dry finish.  M - Smooth and slightly creamy, moderate carbonation, and mellow alcohol presence for such a high ABV IPA.  D - Dangerously high for an IIPA  Overall, I immensely enjoyed this beer. It reminded me that beer can be savored and admired like fine wine. I will be buying more.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Tons of thick carmel malt and tons of citrus hops; slightly bready.  T&M - Thick heavier body yet very refreshing, bitter throughout, very fresh, nice sweet caramel flavor, pine and citrus hops.  O - Amazing.  This is one of those beers thats got me lost for words. I don't really know what to say about its flavor. Im a huge Ranger fan and really love that style, but to say thats better is ridiculous. I haven't had the privilege of trying PtY or PtE like some of you, but i'd like to think i've had a few IPAs, however none of them have been as much as an eye open as this one has. Notice I didn't say much about the flavor, that's cause I wasn't sure what to put, I almost don't want to insult the brewmaster. Just stop reading and go pick some up. The 60 is okay, not as good as this. In my opinion the 60 is borderline IPA. I will continue to respect DFH for what they really are and not the word on the street. Beautiful brew!!!

Smell: Nice floral hop smell.  Taste: Well balanced hop flavor with a malty undertone. Nice sweet flavor with the hops that hides the alcohol well in my opinion. I like it so much I have to tell myself ""slow down, you move too fast...""  Mouthfeel: Glides across the tongue elegantly. Not a dry bitter feel I get from many IPAs. I really like this beer.  Overall: This beer just does it for me. I really like the taste and the mouthfeel. As I alluded to above, I probably drink this beer too fast as I just find it very well done.

10099,2093,cbarrett4,4.38,"This is a fantastic Imperial IPA, though not so far beyond the 60 minute IPA to warrant the double price tag (in my opinion).  This is a kicked up version of the 60, with more intensity from the hops and a darker hue. The nose is similar, the texture lovely (what would you expect from these guys) and the finish superb. Again, a stellar beer, one that I drink on occasion... but the 60 minute IPA gets my nod for price and quality.  Worthy!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

A: Light mahogany brown body with a full, thick and creamy slightly off-white head. Evident carbonation bubbles in the glass and wonderful lace rings.  S: Sweet caramel malt base is up front, followed by some grassy and earthy hops. A slight bitterness is present but not as noticeable in comparison to say, the 60 Minutes. The nose here seems much more balanced and sweet.  T: It doesn't get much better than this, folks. Sweet roasted caramel malt, hints of espresso, faint bitterness from the hops, no citrus qualities to speak of. A lot sweeter than I expected for an IIPA (at the time).  M: Medium-bodied, almost chewy, perfect carbonation.  This beer made me fall in love with IPAs in general and there is no reason for me not to review it on here.

Not ""grapefruitish"" as the 60 minute but still there. The finish is all sweet sugary malts.  Mouthfeel - Very rich brew here no hop bite all but its a medium body with a soft feel going down. Little dry on the after taste very warming going down.  Overall - Very rich brew here gets even richer as it warms up I'd like it to be less rich as it warms but still nice all around.

10099,2093,BerkeleyBeerMan,4.71,"Appearance: Honey amber. Brilliant creamy head about 1/3 inch thick that sticks to the glass. Slightly opaque, slightly clouded. Large amount of lacing.  Smell: Was it brewed in wood? A heavy dose of Cocoa malt hits my nose. There is a also a nice dose of vanilla and slight smokey smell. Heavy smell of alcohol that isn't really masked by the other ingredients. Hops smell like a mix of citrus and pine. Aromatic hops somewhat lacking.  Taste: This is my first review of an East coast DIPA and it is definitely much malted than it's west coast counterparts. I like the way the bitterness blends right in with the malt. It all hits you at once. Bread with a blend of tough chewy malts that leave a spicy caramel impression. 90 minute has a huge hop profile ranging from extremely bitter to citric. Every sip is different. The hops are grapefruit, pine and apple peel. I love the refreshing punch flavor, it sort of taste like rum punch. Some wild uncontrolled esters and phenols enhance the taste of the beer. It is in no way restrained. Lots of character. The bitterness is pleasant. Finishes toasted malts, very warming and refreshing at the same time.  Mouthfeel: Very chewy. 90 minute is a solid bodied beer in look and taste. You can't really go wrong with a beer that paid just as much attention to the malts as it did to the hops. This beer is a masterpiece in texture.  Drinkability: Very good. It may be hard to put back more than one of these in sitting because of the heavy ABV and the medium body but I sure want to. The flavors are so clear. It taste of alcohol which in this case is good. It's a strong beautiful drink that can definitely hold its own in all the saloons across the world.

10099,2093,PaulfromNoVa,4.92,"I'm in the tank for Dogfish Head 90 minute and looked forward to loving this, which had been in the growler almost two days when reopened, with a champagne-bottle ""pop!"" Carbonation speaking to me.  Respectful offspring pours for me, into one of those pretty tulipy Sam Adams perfect pint lager glasses. This is a familiar, lovely looking brew: handsome white head over burnt orange body. It sits there with a kind of haughty grandeur, as if it comprehended its distinguished pedigree and reputation. Its lacing is fine - like tree rings - I cannot believe it has been in the growler for as long as it has and has been opened twice for pouring.  Hops overpower the nose, delightful, citrusy hops, with a bare undertone of malty sweetness. I don't want to take my schnozzle out of the glass, inhaling, exhaling, and consider hitting it nasally.  As much as I expect the sock of hops after lingering long on the fragrance, in the mouth it surpasses my expectations. Big big big. As bitter as can be, but something about this refined bitterness connects with higher mammalian neurology and lodges squarely in the pleasure center of the brain, which cries, ""again!"" The carbonation is present but discernible only if you're trying really really hard. Otherwise its just hippity hoppity hops.  This is it, really.

Powerful, but not overbearing, floral and slightly citrusy hops make up the middle which are immediately followed by a malty and slightly caramelly finish, and probably because of this bottle's temperature, a bit of a boozy finish.  M: Moderate carbonation with a slightly sticky, though very smooth, draught.  O: This is probably my favorite imperial IPA right now, maybe next to Avery's Maharaja.

Just so the reader knows where I am coming from I am not usually a fan of IPAs so I was nervous to try this one. That being said I was very impressed with this beer. The taste of this beer is out standing. You get a ton of flavor and hops without a sacrificing the smoothness of the beer. There is a slight bitterness to the after taste that reminds me of other IPAs but this beer has a significantly better taste. It also leaves you mouth feeling quenched without any dryness to it.

The taste is bringing all those aromas together.

10099,2093,StoutHunter,4.23,"I picked up a single of this at the Lager Mill for $2.55. I have never had any beer from Dogfish Head before so I think the time has come for me to pop my cherry and see what all the hype is about. I know I probably should of started with the 60 minute but that one wasn't on the singles shelf so 90 minute it is. No visible bottling date. Poured from a 12oz brown bottle into a pint glass.  A- I like the simplistic labeling, it works with this brew, also good description on how the beer is brewed. This beer poured a nice looking amber color with three fingers worth of fluffy white head that died down to a thick ring that left lots of nice lacing. This is one good looking brew.  S- The aroma is dominated by citrus fruits, mainly grapefruit and mangos. I can pick up some sweetness from the malts but the aroma is all about the hops. Smells good can't wait to try it.  T- The taste is very similar to the aroma. The citrus hops are at the forefront of this brew. Mangos, grapefruits, and oranges are present. The malts provide a nice backbone for this beer and the sweetness goes good with the bitterness, pretty well balanced. I can pick up a little Alcohol but not much.  M- Creamy, medium bodied, and excellent carbonation.  Overall I thought this was a pretty good DIPA. All the flavors I would expect from a DIPA were there and executed very well. This beer also looked damn good, the head and lacing was everything I want from a DIPA. The price per ounce is about the same as Hop Stupid, next time I want a good DIPA I might be inclined to get 2 singles of this rather then my go to bomber of Hop Stupid. This beer made a good first impression for Dogfish Head on me and I would love to see what else they have. Now I see why so many people love this beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Now that could be both a good and bad thing. On the one hand, if you are looking to really sip and savor an Imperial IPA then this one maybe is a little weak tasting for me. On the other hand though, if you are looking for something that goes down easy despite the high alcohol content, then you might want to pick the Dogfish Head version.  The smell has hints of fruit but also maybe a little wheat which was odd to me. A bitter taste but not overpowering.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

It has a nice citrus & pine scent to it. And some caramel like sweetness to it. For the 9% alcohol I don't really pick up on the alcohol taste as much as I would have expected. I can feel it a touch at the end of swallow.  The sweet taste really comes through for me, and that sweetness stays in the aftertaste as well.

Lace is sticking around in patches like the winter snow in the shade.  Smell is sweet malts. Some citrus, maybe an orange. I also get some biscuit smell.  Tastes is similar to the smell mild citrus hop in the front turns to sweet and then I get the yeast. I would have to say the malts win the battle, but very well balanced. Getting a bit of the alcohol as it warms a bit.  The feel is outstanding. Not a hole in this from front to back. Rich, silky and full to the end. I have to keep licking the sweet malts off of my lips.  I have had this many times in the past but I don't think I have had one this fresh, dated 02/03/11, so it's 6 weeks old. Not bad for across the country and up into the mountains of Arizona. It isn't a West Coast hop punch of an Imperial but that doesn't mean it's not a great DIPA. Highly recommended!!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,rdilauro,4.5,"Just popped the cap and I was in hop heaven. Slight golden color with a new creamy head.. The taste was even better than I thought. It filled my entire mouth and the finish was even better than the start. Cant say I detected any fruits, malt or other characteristics... To me is was HOP HOP HOP  Second Tasting 05/28/12  As I have tasted more and more IPA type beers, I've come to realize what I like, what I am looking for and what I do not like. After tasting many beers in the &gt; 100 IBU , I feel this one is more balanced than when I first tasted it. The hops are there, no question about it, but the aroma is more grapefruit and citrus I also picked up pleasant barley aroma.  the taste was so smooth. Hops, Barley came across very balanced with citrus overtones. Each sip was ""rich' and full. Nothing holding back with the taste on this one.  I do get a bit of full roundness that I experienced with their 120 brow. There was a common ground of flavours here.  Made me think about all my wine tasting experiences. With Italaian wines, there is always an 'earthy' aroma and taste. With French wines, its the slight mineral flavor from the slate and soils, and the New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc that are rich in taste with a full grapefruit taste.  Dogfish Head beers, specifically their IPA types, all have a distinct aroma, feel and flavor the I am beginning to feel I could detect without seeing the bottle.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Clownpants,4.77,Quite possibly the best IPA I have tasted. Has the ABV that I desire (and demand) in an IPA. Smells great and the hops are not overwhelming like Hop Ottin' IPA. A minute or two after a taste I still have the great taste ruminating in my mouth. Tastes nearly as good in bottle as it does on tap. Price is worth it.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S- just smell malts with the slightest citrusy/ floral hop scent. nothing too crazy or what i think an american double/ imperial ipa should be.  T- well it's not bad. too much malt presence tho. alcohol is detected but very slightly.  M- medium bodied. good carbonation.  D- i would pick up a 4 pack down the road but it's not the 1st nor 30th on my list.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,jester5120,3.67,Served from a bottle  A- very average appearance. pale straw color and minimal lacing on the glass.  S- strong hop aroma with some sweet malty character to it.  T- very well balanced malt and hops flavor. more malt character and less hops in comparison to the 60 minute ipa.  M- average mouthfeel. light to medium bodied. malt flavor stuck around a little longer than an average ipa but hops hung around for quite a while.  O- A very well balanced ipa with a little more hop character than usual,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,seand,4.12,"A: Pours a slightly reddish amber, with a fair amount of dense foamy off-white head. Enough of a layer retains to leave decent lacing.  S: Syrupy malty sweetness, with major citrus notes. Fairly big aroma, but reasonably nice balance.  T: Like the smell would suggest, huge sweetness followed by citrusy hops. The bitterness is balanced enough by the sweetness that the finish isn't really bitter. There's also some grain flavors, with a slight astringency on the finish.  M: Medium to full body, medium carbonation.  D: It's a big beer, and it doesn't hide that fact, but it's still fairly drinkable anyway.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Sorvahr,1.99,"I purchased this beer at Grape and Grain Wines and Spirits in Memphis, TN. The label was interesting, with a rough paper surface and a design and theme somewhere between ""handcrafted"" and ""homemade"" with intentionally misaligned letters and simple graphics. The beer itself, however, proved to be rather underwhelming.  A: Golden in color with moderate clarity and some head. Pretty typical for a pale ale.  S: Immediately I noticed that this beer smelled fruity. Very, very fruity, sort of like an inexpensive red wine. The aroma was bright and carried for a considerable distance. The smell was one-dimensional, with no subtlety or additional smell besides fruit and a bit of hops.  T: The initial taste has an overwhelming flavor of grapefruit that buries most of the other flavors in the beer. A bright, spritzy bitter flavor struggles to rise above the cloying grapefruit-juice taste but doesn't become prominent until the first grapefruit tidal wave recedes somewhat, and is accompanied by a warming alcohol flavor that becomes stronger in the finish--at 9% ABV this is a beer of considerable potency.  M: Average. Not too thin, not too thick, not noteworthy enough to draw your attention away from the bizarre grapefruit taste.  D: Difficult. The extreme ester/fruit flavor is loud, sweet, and in-your-face, making drinking it something of a slog. I would not recommend this beer to anyone who is not a big fan of fruity-tasting ales.  Overall, this is a very coarse and very one-dimensional beer with almost no subtlety at all. It takes one aspect of an ale and cranks it up to ridiculous levels at the expense of everything else. If this is a typical example of Dogfish Head's product I honestly cannot understand all the praise they get. It's like a comic book--big loud bright colors and lots of superficial flash, but no subtlety or balance.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,IKR,3.91,"Appearance: Clear amber color with thick off-white head.  Smell: Hops, toffee, and some fruity notes. the hop notes come through as more of the neutral varieties, just a trace of pine and citrus fruit.  Taste: Toffee and caramel notes come through almost concurrently with the hop notes which mirror the nose ( just a trace of pine and citrus fruit).  Mouth-feel: Medium body and good carbonation level.  Drink-ability: Very good to my tastes.  The fact that I like this beer and I'm nobody's hop head makes me think the true hop heads might want a more upfront hop presence. The balance works for me though.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Rutager,4.07,"Appearance. Nice hazy golden orange with a finger of sticky, bubbly head that leaves some beautiful lacing.  Smell. Sweet pineapple, grassy hops, a little yeast funk and light malt.  Taste. Rich caramel malt and piney, grassy hops. Some bread and bitter finish with a little pink grapefruit.  Mouthfeel. Medium body, medium carbonation, some warming alcohol.  Overall. Good drinker for the abv. Would buy again if the price was right.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,rapidsequence,3.96,"12 oz bottle from a $10 fourpack I bought at Kroger in Lynchburg. Bottled 2/3/11.  Appearance: Very attractive clear orange. Great head retention and sticky lacing.  Smell: Piney and sweet citrus hops. Candi-like malt sweetness with a hint of grain. A little alcohol.  Taste: Sweet, very sweet. Caramel maltiness is somehow the first thing I taste. A pretty substantial piney hops flavor and a smack of bitterness follows to a nice balance. Too nice of a balance. Alcoholic finish.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, full. Resiny and sticky. This is how I like em.  Overall: The drinkability is... DOH. Overall this is a good beer. A very malty, sweet DIPA. I've had this many, many times over the last 8 or 10 years, and it seems to become more mediocre the more I try other beers. Still solid, and readily available.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Mood dependent, this can be admirable or deplorable. Tonight it's somewhere in the murky middle ground. A good beer, an accessible beer, but not a beer that I ever consistently reach for.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

T- This is a great IPA. Its smooth and hides the alcohol nicely. Very hoppy with some floral tone. The malt is necessary for this beer to add a level of balance. Well done dogfish..  M- Nice feel, doesn't dry my mouth out with the hop feel. I was expecting it to and the way that it drinks surprises me and i congratulate Dogfish head for brewing this great brew.

10099,2093,Avantyawn,3.02,"32 oz Growler pour from Whole Foods Tribeca. My first time having this on tap, always in bottle, never a huge fan but curious how it would taste on tap for a while...  A: Hazy reddish brown, slight head, no lacing.  S: caramel, sugar, super bready malts. Not much of a heavy hop scent here. Smells like a desert drink.  T: Hmm..This really tastes sugary and bready to me. I don't taste any hop bitterness, just a silky smooth sugary slurp with a little bit of pine at the close. I'm really not nuts about this beer.  M: Probably the best part of this beer to me is the texture. While the sweetness is off putting to the taste, the round sugary syrupy feel to it is nice.  D: While I am not nuts about this beer, it is very easy to drink, even for its ABV. I don't quite get why this beer is so highly heralded. Maybe this batch is a bit off, but I am disappointed and glad I didn't get a 64 ounce growler fill!  This beer is way too bready sweet and malty for my DIPA taste. Give me a citrusy DIPA anyday over this.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,arkurzynski,4.4,Pours a deep hazy amber with off-white head. Aroma is amazing - layered hops that start piney then go to grapefruit then give a brief floral kiss at the end of the inhalation. Also a bit of candied-fruit in there somewhere. Clean bitterness that sits right above a well-positioned caramel malty backbone. Deep fruits. Bitterness hangs on and reminds you what you're missing when the glass is empty. Well-carbonated with flavors that bounce off the palate. A masterpiece!,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,bigfoot13,2.98,"Keg and bottle tastings from late April to mid March of 2011.  This used to be my favorite beer. Lately, whether drinking from keg or bottle, this beer is too sweet on the finish. They put in a ton of hops throughout the brewing, and I just don't taste them like I used to. Right now, I prefer the 60 minute over the 90 minute.  I really think Dogfishhead is having high alcohol yeast problems. I don't think the current 90 minute beer is fully developed.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,rowingbrewer,3.62,This beer pours a dark reddish brown color with a decent sized head. The smell is sweet with a bit of piney hops at the end. The Taste is smooth with the Malt really coming through and only mild bitterness. Not a lot of hop flavor or aroma. This tastes more like a barleywine than an dipa. The mouthfeel is good and has good carbonation. And at 9% this beer is very drinkable. Not that this is a bad beer I really enjoy it but I do think it should be classified differently,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S=Malt sweetness does hit, but then nice floral citrus hops soon dominate the nose.  Upon first first drink, I notice the medium body of caramel,toffee and lots of malt sweetness. But no hops!!!??? No hop bite I could detect. Very disappointing. Very pleasant to drink without being too sweet, but this is supposed to be a Double/Imperial IPA, so WTH??  Very drinkable at 9%, this is a rather good beer, but I have to minus some points on this, because of the lack of hop bite. If they had labeled it as a barley-wine,or maybe strong ale/black IPA, I would rate it higher. Very good, it's just not a real American IPA,much less a Double/Imperial.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,JonathanG,4.45,"Poured from a 12-oz. bottle into a pint glass.  A: A clear, golden-copper color, with a 1-finger head that receded pretty quickly, leaving a skim coat of clean, white head, maintained by various streams of constantly rising, tiny bubbles of CO2 from below. I think I should've poured this a bit more aggressively to garner a thicker head? I've got 3-bottles left, so will try again sometime this week to see if and how things change with a more aggressive pour.  S: Some bready/doughy notes that quickly give way to spicy, tangerine-laced, slightly herbal hops, along with some sweet malt coming back into play.  T: Spicy, slightly piney and light herbal hops, with a bit of orangy citrus, canned peaches, and apricots. Some sweetness to balance out the hops.  M: Sweet, but not overly viscous, you can feel the DIPA alcohol level, but it comes across as smooth, not hot or overbearing. Everything feels pretty balanced between the dryness of the hops, the sweetness of the malt, and the weight of the alcohol.  D: I think there is a good balance here between all components. If you're a fan of the dry west coast style, this may be a touch sweet for you. Hides the 9%-ABV well, so I don't think it would be difficult to drink more than one of these.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Pine, floral, citrusy / grapefruit & hops are very present.  T & M - Very full bodied beer that was silky smooth. I don't think I've tasted a more silky feeling beer on the tongue. Starts smooth and sweet, and finishes with some bitter hops / alcohol.  D - Very smooth for a DIPA. Alcohol could sneak up on you, but this was an excellent beer. Well worth the wait!

10099,2093,RandyV,3.96,"This flagship beer from DFH is a nice example of an American DIPA. It is mostly balanced, with the sufficient hop bite you want and expect from this type of ale softened by malt sweetness. It does finish slightly sweet, and the ABV certainly presents itself, though it never takes center stage.

High ABV is a bit apparent..maybe the only negative.  M - maybe a bit too carbonated...or else the spiciness is noticeable. But very smooth...slightly thick aftertaste.  D - So, so smooth.

S - Sharp piney hops followed by a smooth caramel malt aroma and spicy alcohol. Mellow sweetness in there as well, especially as it warms. A great setup for the first sip.  T&M - Strong piney hops hit first and actually have some citrus in there as well. The malt body quickly balances things out with a nice sweetness. Some dark ripe fruits come in to play as well. The alcohol is spicy and warming and adds a nice touch and rounds things out.  D - If not for the high ABV, the beer is incredibly drinkable.

T: Strong hops, then sweet caramel malt, then nice bitter finish with a alcohol warm. Has it all, some qualities of a tripel or quad, but with the hop heavy qualities of an IPA.  M: Very active carbonation peppering the tongue coupled with a slightly thick chewy viscosity. I enjoy, but could see how some wouldn't. Definitely thicker than I expected, but not unenjoyable.

I have taken quite a bit of interest into craft beers especially IPA's  A: Very pretty amber colored pour. (into a snifter) Depending on the pour, a fingers worth of head. The beer has a beautiful lacing that lasts around the rim of the glass.  S: Since I am not that experienced with beer reviewing, I would personally have to say that this beer has notes of a pine tree, and hints of grapefruit.  T: This was the first beer that I have sat down to review, and I really enjoy this beer. I get a sweet malt flavor out of this beer. Not like most IPA's I've had. While this DFH does hop this beer very well, it is not overwhelming.  MF: It's a bit thick. I really enjoy it, but it really is a bit thick. It goes down quite easily though.  DRNK: Obviously, to me since this is in a four pack, I do not plan on finishing it in a night. Although, this is one of the easier IPA's to drink IMO, I wouldn't like to finish a four pack in an evening especially because it is upwards of $11 a 4 pack.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

You get the hop presence lingering in the aftertaste, however, the malt and barley mask it up front. Slight lingering bitterness.  M & D - Crisp sharp carbonation bites into the tongue.

There are piney hops present though, but for some reason I think the malt is more prominant.  T - Strong malt flavours and surprisingly strong alcohol taste as well.

One of the most beautiful beers in the world to me.  S: All hops at first, strong citrus (especially pinapple and grapefruit) and pine. A little bready malt on the end and some alcohol also evident. I could smell this all day if I didn't drink it so fast!  T: A mouthful of straight hops. Piney at first, then fruit notes, more hop oil, and a slightly sweet malt finish. Hop bitterness lingers on the palate, begging me to take another sip and experience it all over again. Alcohol is present and nicely warming, but not quite 9% ABV.  M: Nice and full-bodied, more so than I would expect from a DIPA but not overpowering. Slightly chewy, creamy, and coats the mouth with slick hop oils.  D: Absolutely amazing, the only thing that stops me from killing a 4 pack every time I have it is price!  Overall, a fantastic brew that is unmatched in many respects in the DIPA style. From a West coast hophead, this East coast brew sets the standard incredibly high. This was one of the first top quality craft beer that set me down the road on my BA journey, and I'll always love it.

Head lingered for some time before receding to some decent, but not mind-blowing, lacing.  Aroma is sweet, citrusy with a touch of prickly pine and a little grain coming through. Taste is also sweet and citrusy without being overly bitter. Very good tasting and smelling beer.  Mouthfeel is sticky and resinous, but still medium in body and enjoyable. The 9% abv is hidden quite well, but you probably don't want to make an evening out drink 90 Minute unless you have nowhere to go in the morning.  For me, this is a great end of a long day sipper.

Appearance: 90 Minute pours a mostly clear copper color with light orange highlights. About 2 fingers of slightly off-white head forms, that has great retention and lacing. Super looking beer.  Smell: I get a definite bready malt character up front, followed by citrus, hops, and a pang of spicy alcohol. A bit above average for a DIPA.  Taste: Bready maltiness up front, with a bunch of citrus, a not-over-the-top amount of hops, and a bit of spicy alcohol on the back end. A pleasing citrus-hop punch on the finish. Much better than the smell. The spicy alcohol character really makes this a unique beer in my opinion. I haven't tasted any DIPAs that were quite like this.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Body is just under medium, and damn close to chewy due to low carbonation. Fabulous. Super creamy and smooth going down. Overall, a very good DIPA.

Poured into a small goblet.  A: Very little head, more like a thin film of cream-white bubbles; great lacing, good retention. Beautiful, clear dark-golden honey color.  S: Slightly herby and hoppy, but overall a very sticky/sweet, rich smell; not effervescently floral or fruity/hoppy like some IPAs (though that's not a bad thing)  T: Creamy, thick, with a very smooth hop flavor to balance everything out. This flavor is deep and rich, exceptionally so; it gives very little of that sharp hop bitterness.  M: This is incredibly smooth and lightly carbonated for an IPA. It coats the mouth very nicely, and has a slightly creamy consistency to it  O: This tastes so good, the only thing keeping me from drinking it all night is the high ABV that fills you up and knocks you down after 2-3 12oz'ers.  Overall, I would definitely say that this is one of the best IIPA's I've ever had so far. It's absolutely incredible and well worth every penny.

The smell of this one was a nice sweet malty bread smell with a nice combo of hops mixed in. Did not smell overly hoppy to me.  The taste of this one is a nice sweet malty flavor at first that paves the way for the truckload of hops that will soon be hitting the palate. After that the malts come back in to even out the whole experience and leave you with a very nice semi hoppy aftertaste.  The mouthfeel of this one is slightly dry and the drinkability is decent to me but this one seems a little on the heavier side and I could only see myself drinking a few of these.  Very nice DIPA by the dogfish head brewing co. Picked up one to try because I've heard nothing but good things and was not dissapointed.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,soju6,4.08,"A: Pours a clear burnt-orange color with a decent head and good lacing that lasts quite a while.  S: Has an unexpected mild aroma of pine and fresh grain with a trace of citrus poking through.  T: Taste is a unique mixture of pine, citrus, fresh grain with a touch of sweetness. Has a good bitterness and a dry finish.  F: Medium body, very smooth and very well balanced. The 9% ABV is well hidden.  D: Good drinker. Excellent beer, even though this style is not my favorite.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Has a smooth nuttiness scent, as it warms up citrus aromas linger out.  T- Again the malts stand out, slight bitterness but excellent balance, sweet after taste.  M- Moderate carbonation, sweet and smooth on the palate, excellent aftertaste.  D- Very drinkable especially for the high abv 9%. Everything comes together in this brew.

10099,2093,cinematicgypsy,4.1,"I'm not a fan of most IPA's only because they're super hoppy and usually the dead yeast sediment is a turn-off. With that said, this beer is no exception to the rule. Incredibly hoppy beer. However, i found very little dead yeast in the bottom of the bottle which made both my palette and tummy very happy!  Smells a bit like grapefruit and finishes much the same...very clean. No strong after taste, which is great.  Feels silky and sudsy on the tongue like cream soda, but with much less carbonation.  Light gold color with lots of froth that sticks to the glass even after it has been emptied. This beer always has a little 'fizz' to it, even after you've poured the last drop. It looks glorious in the glass.  Overall it is not my favorite IPA because it isn't quite 'refreshing' enough, but it is a good segue if you aren't accustomed to the strong contrast in taste that an IPA brings to your lips.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,12percent,4.85,"Im new to craft beers and this beer was my transition from Bud Light to IPA. No matter how many other beers I try and no matter how delicious the others are, this will always have a special place in my heart. I am still learning about more flavorful beers, so excuse my lack of explanation of the beer.  Full flavored and delicious. Very hoppy. Starts strong and finishes strong. The higher ABV makes it great for sipping. Lower carbonation. Kept in the fridge, but I raised the temperature slightly before drinking.  Although stronger, I would recommend to anyone looking to branch out from the norm.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,chilly460,4.3,"A- Nice clear white one finger head on top of a amber/orange beauty of a beer. Lacing is impressive, sticks to the glass forever in thick sheets.  S- I get terrific citrus hops followed by caramel malt, very straightforward. Some toffee sweetness as well.  T- Yeehaw, tangy citrus hops hit first. They're lighter then the pine variety, and easy to take but still let you know it's a big IPA. The beauty of this beer is the way the caramel malt flavor takes over perfectly to balance, but the sip ends without a sweet aftertaste. This is a beauty of a beer.  M- Medium body and carbonation is all I ask for in this style, it's solid in this respect.  D- Solid beer, the balance and marriage of strong flavors make it easy to drink. Been drinking this one for awhile and it never gets old, hides the booze well which is my preference for the style",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,afksports,4.4,"90 Minute is pretty much a go-to at this point, and I love the restructuring of the Planet Earth's Top100 that's put this much higher up the list.  This review is from notes, when I had 90 Minute IPA on the Randall (their on-tap fresh hopping system which you have to see), during happy hour at the brewpub in Rehobeth, Delaware. Now that I'm on my DIPA kick, I think I might just grab a few more for dinner.  The appearance of the beer bottled is clear copper orange with a mild head. Through the Randall it's much more ruddied, being that it's freshly wet-hopped, and the head is more prominent and sustains some moderate lace. The fresh hopping gives it a lovely floral and citrus smell that matches with a malty caramel backbone that comes through lovely in the nose. The taste follows that, and the finish is hoppy but totally clean. Great going down, and drinkable to the core, this may be one of the best DIPA's I've had on tap. Ever.  I wanted to enjoy this brew as long as I could, but also couldn't stop drinking it. Given that I followed it up with a solid fantasy football draft, I'd say Dogfish Head's 90 Minute IPA deserves every praise it receives.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,jayavery,4.35,"Beer: Dogfish Head 90 Minute Imperial IPA Brewer: Dogfish Head Craft Brewery Company: Delaware, United States Style: American Double/Imperial IPA ABV: 9.00%  Beer Advocate: Jay Avery Rating: A  This was a painfully hard beer to find, especially after that 'Brewmasters' show which popularized this particular brew then DFH limited the production of it, my local liquor store was out of stock for 3 months straight! They called me when they finally got a shipment in so I grabbed an entire case, here's my review...  Presentation: 12 oz Bottle served at pretty close to 50 degrees with a semi aggressive pour into a Hoegaarden Octoglass. It was bottled on 01/12/2011. This review was done on 02/26/2011.  Appearance: It pours a crown royal gold with a 2 finger sunset yellow head. I suspected with the amount of hops that the lacing would be extremely stubborn and it was! Awesome lacing that clung to the octoglass like velcro and stuck around until I was ready for the next sip!  Smell: The nose was a fantastic evergreen forest pine with a grassy and earthy dankness and a hint of lemon zest and citrusy hop oils.  Mouthfeel: Oily medium bodied with low carbonation and a bitter hoppy bite on the swallow.  Taste: Hop forward and stays true to the nose. I love this Double IPA! Piney, citrusy, earthy, grassy, zesty, herbal and a complete HOP HEAD's dream! I feel like I'm out in the wilderness camping, literally sitting on a log and smelling natures' foresty glory. The hops are apparent but the profile is balanced and not stupid bitter like other Imperials. The ""me so hoppy"" machine that they use to dry hop this brew during the conditioning process really sets this one apart from other DIPA's. This will be my go-to DIPA when it's available.  Drinkability: You'd never guess that it's a 9 percenter. Even its predecessor, the 60 minute took on a much harsher, bitter personality. This 90 minute is a smooth operator and the flavors come alive as it warms. That paired with the low to no carbonation in the body at warmer temps contribute to its smoothness and can really get away from you, it's a creeper!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,mcwilson04,4.73,"This is a wonderful beer. Drink this a mouthful at a time, this is something to savor. When poured into a glass it is clear as wine, with perfect head. The hops are right where they need to be with the high alcohol content. This is strong beer, but does not taste boozy or wine like. I really like this, and will leave technical appraisals to others.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,TakeTheMonyNrun,4.67,"Pours a dark amber with maybe a 1/2 inch head or less. An outstanding aroma, lots of hops (as expected form the brewing process advertised on the label). There is a lot of great varying hoppy taste in this one - and the aftertaste sticks around for a while, acts as a nice relaxing beer. A nice full mouth-feel, thick almost like a creamy, syurp-y feel. This beer is potent, at 9% ABV, I may be on a smaller weight-class, but I can feel a decent buzz about 4/5 through one. Definitely a beer to enjoy, sip on one or two in a sitting - couldn't recommend this beauty enough, truly delicious.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Great combination of malt and hops.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,MoreThanWine,4.24,"Poured a lovely golden color with a massive 3"" head which took awhile to dissipate. Fresh clean hops smell. Taste is mildly sweet with more fresh clean hops, caramel, prune and fig. It's so fresh in fact that even the day after if I smell the empty bottle it smells like I just then opened it. Clearly a high quality IPA but I take exception to the box claim this might be the best IPA in America - it's a quite good IPA though.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,Smakawhat,4.35,"Having taking some more effort I am re-reviewing this one. Bottle is date Jan 13 2011, we are good to go!  Straight down the middle pour into a Nonick pint glass gives a wonderful creamy off white brown head of four fingers. Head is very creamy and fluffy it looks right our of the tap. Great burnt orange amber body, clear with zero visible carbonation.  Small malt, a good bit of bread, and of course some smelling hoppy ness. A very subtle nose and some type of sweet hard candy. Much more varied than I expected. Good but still all very subtle.  Dense malt and orange coat the palate, mouthfeel is big bold and DENSE without being syrupy. Orange citrus washes my mouth and no hint of boozyness. Good balance of taste, with a hint of sweet malt in the finish, lingering but not overpowering hop bitters, and orange zest and flesh goodness.  Wow this is even better than I remember it and why I fell in love with this brewery many years ago.  ---  - old review from 5-18-2008  A clear consistency of bronze hue, with sharp hops on the nose.  Light bodied, but has a very long finish. The mouthfeel is not as dense as I was expecting and seemed very thin. Great bouquet and high hop consistency seems balanced on the nose, but it's thin body seems to pull more of the alcohol out instead of the flavors. Overall though still very good.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

A lot of citrusy hops in the scent. Mostly grapefruit and tropical fruit. Some malty sweetness to back that up.  Taste is very sweet and malty at first (with some honey flavors), followed up by a nice splash of fruity hops. Bitterness is just right. Alcohol taste is masked well. Very well balanced.  Mouthfeel is medium-full. Almost has a light syrupy feel to it. Carbonation is right on point.  Drinkability is high. Very smooth and tasty. Good thing I bought a few!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Great pine and citrus notes on the nose and the taste follows with a sweet grapefruit with touches of pine and citrus hops. Nice malty middle of biscuit and toasted breads. Touch of sweet.

10099,2093,glazeman,3.94,"A: on the darker side of the spectrum as far as orange goes with a 1.5 finger white head that had excellent retention and lacing.  S: There's some piney hops on the nose, but overall I wasn't really impressed by the smell as I really had to search deep to find much of anything.  T: The flavor was way more welcoming and complex than the smell. There was a nice balance of grapefruit citrus hops and piney hops, with the edge going to the piney hops. Although, there is a bit of orange juice like sweetness at the finish mixed in with the general bitterness. Overall this was quite good in my opinion.  M: The mouthfeel was pretty run-of-the-mill as far as IPAs go for me. The carbonation was appropriate and the aftertaste was decent.  D: If it wasn't for the ease of finding dreadnaught and hopslam (this time of year) I would definitely have this more often.

10099,2093,Crossmd,3.87,"12oz into a tulip glass.  Appearance is pretty, with a crystal clear penny copper color, light bubbles floating up from the bottom. About 1/3 of a finger of ivory head. Attractive, for the most part.  Some of the strongest smell I've ever ever experienced in a beer. Hops all over the place, faint breads and some caramel that I could smell perfectly at arms length as soon as I uncapped. In terms of strength, this is the sheer aromatic impact that every beer should shoot for.  Robust and simplistic in taste, an explosion of flavor that falls out quickly with a sort of nuttiness that I've come to find characteristic of Dogfish Head. Strong alcohol taste, hints, ghosts of the most profound parts linger.  Mouthfeel is very interesting, very oily in substance to my palate. I can actually see it leave a clear sort of oil around the edges of the glass as I drink it. Coats the inside of my mouth after about halfway through.  A very strong offering by Dogfish Head, and something that I can appreciate. My palate though finds it almost too strong and oily. This doesn't seem like a beer that I would pick up very often just for leisure (especially at 3$ retail per 12oz bottle..) but I'd be very curious to see how it paired with some foods.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Head dissipates with good amount of lacing on glass.  S- Bits of floral and citrus hops with ever so slight malt smell.  T- Lots of up front hops with a nice malt backbone, but it is hop dominant. Has a nice apple taste.  M- Medium body with a good amount of carbonation. Should try this beer on draft if at all possible. Much more lively and extreme than its bottle version.  D- Enjoyable.

Fresh smell up front. Nice sweet caramel malt in the back. Overall smells like a tart caramel apple.  T: Tart citrus and sweet malt balanced initially. Sweet and tart caramel apple along with grapefruit. Then the bittering hops come in with full force, more of a floral to citrus peel. Picking up the 9% abv with a bit of ethanol.  M: Medium body with carbonation. Pretty light for what I expected from an Imperial, making it that much more drinkable. Finishes a little bitter from the hops.  D: Quite well balanced.

More hops now on taste, but a sweet malty middle and then a nice bourbon style finish. Almost a Belgian yeast influence here. Nice full body, creamy mouthfeel and sweet finish. This is a bit heavy for me for other than a sipper and the alcohal is quite prominent. Where I have had other big IPA's that were thirst quenchers, this beer showcases the alcohal front and centre and comes off more like a barly wine to me.

The lacing is ridiculous on this beer, tilt it away, then tilt it back, and it looks like the foam just sticks to the side of the glass for ages. Really cool appearance. Color is a deep rich amber.  S- Carmel malts, citrus hops. A little toffee. I found the smell to be the one weak point of this beer. It was just a little more dull than I would like.  T- Wow. Just wow. So very, very complex and balanced. This is the most balanced IPA I have had at this point in my very young beer drinking life. Sweet roasted caramel malts meet right in the middle with a tangy citrus. DFH did a great job of balancing out the huge hops with a wonderful malt profile.  M- Pretty thick. Consistency matches up well to the flavors.  D- Very solid.

Aromas of citrus, mostly grapefruit hops, sweet malts that are biscuit-y and full. Occasionally there's a little skunky aroma. Tastes are unique from a lot of DIPAs. Yes, it's hoppy with a nice bitter finish, but there's more to it than that. It's well balanced with malt and more flavors that I can't put my finger on. Dried figs or dates? Maybe the yeast is adding some flavor. Very nice.  The mouth feel is medium plus and it's quite drinkable, but beware of the 9% abv.

S: Grapefruit, orange zest, resinous, and slightly spicy complex hop profile supported by a sweet pumpkin bread base. An excellent nose... would love to experience in a snifter.  T: Extremely unique! (it is DFH, after all) Standard grapefruit hoppiness is there, but more obvious are spicy hops, which really make quite the statement. Resinous hops are present in the finish. At the same time, a creamy, caramel malt sweetness is quite present, perhaps even swaying that balance in that direction. Alcohol burn lurks just underneath all of this, enhancing the experience.  M: Well carbonated, driving the flavors deep into the tongue... I could perhaps use a rounder foundation, but the brew has a good overall texture.

A sign of carbonation coming from the bottom of the brew.  S- Not a west coast IPA. I don't get the high alpha hops that i smell from some of the more western IPA's. I do get a lot of hops though but definitely more balanced with malts.  T- A nice character for the smell. I figured it to be a lot more mat that i ended up tasting. Amazingly balanced.  M&D- It bites the tongue. I get a hard hit in the back of my throat that runs deep with hops and resin oil. I think is an amazingly drinkable brew for the 9% ABV.

A beautiful dark copperish color when poured with a real hoppy scent that had undertones of citrus and spice.  It had a huge burst of flavour on the first hit which continued throughout the rest of the drink. The high alcohol volume was hidden beautifully by the hops and flavours of cinnamon, honey, citrus and i even caught a strong treacle aftertaste. It's wonderfully crafted.  This is a favorite of mine to come out of the United States and if i ever seen it anywhere out here in London i will definatly buy it again.  Pure heaven in bottle form.

Flavor is a battle between fresh piney hops and slightly sweet sticky malt and sugar. Super good drinkability with little sign of the heavy gravity. Not a beer you can drink easily all night due to power and flavor potency. Overall this is my favorite American IIPA, an example that through dedication you can strike a fantastic balance between strong alcohol, high hoppiness, and sweet maltiness. There must have been many batches thrown away to get this gem.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Brunite,3.56,"A: Poured into a pint glass. Color is a nice amber/orange color. A decent enough 2 finger head.  S: Surprising. For a DIPA....I'm getting something I do not expect...I get darker fruit notes and bready malt sweetness....prune danish.  T: No hops to speak of. This malt-bomb is fighting with the hops to show through but the hops lose. All sweetness with a sharp alcohol bite at the end. No citrus...no pine....no florals...this is a DIPA??? I love my malt....but without any hop bitterness to balance it...well....all you have is syrupy sweetness. Not sure where the high IBU's are hiding here.  M: Very thick and sticky...cough syrupy.  D: Not much drinkablity here. This is not your typical DIPA. Just way too sweet...half way through...so cloying that I had to use this as draino.  O: Ubber-disappointed. I love DIPA's and this is just not there. I did not expect West Coast; but this tastes more like some sort of Belgian Dubbel sans the heavy carbonation. I do not understand the buzz about this beer. Yes...I am familiar with the brewer here and understand their approach. Being off the beaten track in their approach does not mean everything is good. In line with the style or not...I could care less. What I do care about is taste and this one was not drinkable for me. In the end...taste is what brings a drinker back to buy something a second time and this one does not do that. This was so sweet it gave me heartburn...like drinking too much cough syrup. I purchased this in a four pack so I've had it more than once and the verdict remains the same. Very much not impressed.  Update: After getting called out on my review of this beer....I have reconsidered it and tried again. Not sure if I had a bad bottle or my palate was off. But....the second time around was different. I did enjoy this one and will finish my four-pack instead of giving it away now. It pays to reconsider a beer once in awhile, for sure.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Fenris244,4.05,"Clear reddish/amber color, 2 finger white head good retention, leaves a thin lace on the surface of the beer and a good amount clings to the glass  Great smell, very hoppy good amount of apple and citrus aromas as well, grape fruit and pine aromas are also present.  Very hoppy upfront but well balanced out by the malty backbone this beer posseses, apple peel like flavors and the hoppy bitterness last well into the finish and the citrusy flavors are also quite clear throughout.  Mouthfeel is good, the beer has almost a medium body and although the carbonation in this bottle is a little stronger than I would like it keeps from being to much. The 90 minute ipa is quite drinkable and an awesome choice, even more so now that my local grocery stores carry it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,beerman207,4.2,"Thanks to Bamadog for bringing this to our superbowl gathering.  A: Clear orange, good white head that leaves a skim that goes on for quite a while.  S: Pine hops, citrus,  T: Bitter up front, mild malt coming in to mellow all out.  M: Very mild carbonation. Easy to drink. Much smoother than the bottle imo.  D: Bamadog left the growler - that's a good thing. It won't go to waste!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,feylure,4.42,"This is one of my favorite IPAs.  The color is a nice, slightly cloudy gold with a moderate amount of carbonation.  Smells like a hop filled wonderland. Also has some caramel in the aroma.  Taste is fabulous. The hops don't jump out or bite. They have a bold presence, but it has more of a rounded edge to it accompanied with caramel notes from the barely.  I think it is incredibly drinkable. It's smooth, has a full body and end, and it isn't too hoppy. Definitely one of the best!  Cheers",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,BillLovesBeer,4.77,My first 90min only chilled in the fridge for about an hour after plucking the 4-pack from the non-cooler section of the beer isle. Popping the cap I smelled that deliciously hoppy smell you expect when bringing home a craft IPA. Nice copper hue and the taste was exceptional--not too bitter like some other IPA can be. You can tell you're drinking a great beer when it still tastes great a little warm. Continuos hopping is a beautiful thing.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,inlimbo77,4.03,"This is my bread and butter, them being so close and what not. I was surprised that I never actually reviewed it on BA for my list. Had TONS over the years: tap and bottle.  Pour this one from a bottle in my fridge that I'd been holding on to for a while to see what happened with some age. Bottle date was 8/11/10. Poured into DFH signature snifter glass.  A: Pours a pretty, clear amber color. Reddish. 1 finger head that fades quickly, but good carbonation throughout. Nice lacing on the glass.  S: Nice sweet hop aroma. Probably not as strong as when first bottled, but it was still there. I actually got a little alcohol in the nose. And some malts.  T: I don't know but I think a little time did this one well. Good sweet hop flavor. As they say, this is sweeter and less bitter than the 60 min in actuality. Nice malt backbone.  M: Mild mouth coating. Not overly sticky. Taste stays with you a while.  D: As in past sessions, this is one that I could have more of. BUT they do come up on you eventually. 2 or 3 is a solid limit at that 9% ABV. It is hidden nicely, but definitely there.  Overall, DFH is my staple home state go to beer. And I have to say, I live on the 60 and 90 min IPAs from their catalog. Love the other stuff, but these are their top two for me. Highly recommend!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,mgbickel,4.13,"On tap at an Irish bar in Atlantic City...I forget the name...  Served in a Dogfish Head Signature glass. A solid 2 fingers of white head sat on top of the coppery body. The foam stuck around throughout the drink, occasionally clinging to the glass.  The nose is full of resin and citrus...lots of hops. You can detect some bready malts in the background, but very faint.  The flavor is just like the nose...dominated by the hops. The malts come out in the middle but get pushed back quickly by the bitterness.  Light to medium bodied, semi-slick and well carbonated.  This is pretty much a classic...almost to the point of being a standard to the style. Great tasting, well hidden ABV and easy to drink!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,bamadog,4.22,"Picked up a growler of this at Party Town in Florence, KY for the Superbowl. Game came out all wrong, but the beer came out all right. Review is from notes taken on 2/8/2011 and poured from the growler to a pint glass.  Appearance: Pour is a honey/golden/coppery color and it starts with a big thick and lush creamy, off-white head with decent retention that fades slowly to a thick and full cap and leaves thick webs of lacing on the sides of the glass; body has just a touch of haze to it but is mostly clear and it shows strong carbonation bubbling up slowly.  Smell: A wonderful array of hops ranging from pine to grapefruit to something with a tropical hint (perhaps pineapple or mango?); very firm malt backing provides just a touch of balance but lets the hops lead; I love how the hops are big, and they just smell sticky -- also, the nose is quite robust... not as robust as it comes from the tap, but this is probably the next best thing.  Taste: Fan-freaking-tastic -- hops in the mouth are bitter and cover the array mentioned in the nose; definite strong malt backing that is honey sweet and has just a touch of graininess; definite presence of alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Body is of medium weight and comes across a little slick; carbonation is good and it comes across a little soft, but smooth and creamy still; a thick coating that's sticky and becomes cottony dry is left sticking to the roof of the mouth; gums and belly are left warm and tingly from the higher ABV.  Drinkability: Overall, the flavors are outstanding, the smell is great and it packs a wonderful punch... Unfortunately, the punch that it provides may be a bit much and I feel it realistically lowers it a bit, but I would still easily get through a couple of pints in a night.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Hellabeerguzzler,2.85,"I'm love the 60 way over the 90 and the 120 was just totally undrinkable.  a - good. as everyone describes, it looks like DIPA in every regard.  s - it has a nice smell but not a potent aroma that I've had in other beers in this class. not even close. Smells acidic and malty. Fruity yet a little mediciny if that's a word.  t - tastes a little syrupy. It's has a ""made from concentrate"" taste which is a bummer. The alcohol is not hidden well enough and the hops and malt are not nearly as well balanced as the 60.  m - mouthfeel is sticky, a little chewy. Not horrible, but for the price, I'll go with something else. I think they overdid the sweet elements.  d - nah. one is enough. two, you're feeling it. three was hard to finish and was wasted on me.  Dogfish Head has already shown me that they can make a delicious IPA - the 90 minute is not the one. I'm not impressed and will continue on with other IPAs.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,aggiearcher13,4.08,"A: Pours a crystal clear golden orange with a thin but persistent head which clings to the sides of the glass and leaves nice lacing throughout.  S: Citrus. Mostly orange, but some grapefruit also. A touch of pine, and some sweet malt notes.  T: Surprisingly malty. Bitter. Sugary notes while not being sweet. Also pine and citrus, though not nearly as much citrus as was in the nose.  M: Hefty body to it and a near perfect level of carbonation.  O: It's a damn good beer, but it's not my favorite for the style. A little too much of a malt backbone for me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,ngeunit1,4.45,"A - Pours a clear amber-orange color with lively carbonation visible and a finger of foamy white head. Head fades fairly quickly to a ring around the glass with some lacing.  S - Aroma is full of citrus and floral hops. There is also a nice balance of sweet malt and a bit of bread also in the nose. Just a touch of booze evident.  T - Starts off with some nice building bitterness and some sweet malt and a touch of citrus. Really nice and balanced from the start. Through the middle the hops really jump out, but there is still that sweetness from the malt and citrus flavor. The finish has even more hop flavor with some nice bitterness that really lingers along for a while. There is just a hint of booze at the end.  M - Medium bodied with a slightly above moderate amount of carbonation. Feels really lively on the tongue and super smooth and crisp overall. The finish is nice and dry and leaves a bit of a syrupy feeling in the mouth.  D - Very drinkable, even at 9.00% abv. The flavors are very excellently balanced from start to end with a nice hop profile while still having the right malt presence. Very balanced mouthfeel and taste.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

T- Great balance between hops and malt, not one overpowering the other, nice alcohol warming. Finishes very clean with a slight sweetness that is meant to be there for a reason.  M- Medium/medium high carbonation. Nice bitterness that lingers for a second.  D- Pretty drinkable for the amount of alcohol, malts, and bitterness",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,mjhorn,3.68,"Updated after finishing the four pack over the last few days:  Poured into a pint glass with very little head. Nice deep copper color. Smell wasn't as strong as I expected, but what was there was good. Nice mix of citrus and piney hops. I was actually a bit surprised with the flavor. Sweeter than expected, with somewhat underwhelming hops. The hops were certainly there, but less than I expected out this beer. Overall I don't think it was enough to balance the sweetness. Texture could be a tad better in my mind, almost a bit syrupy which I wasn't a fan of. Carbonation level was nice though. Drinkability takes a hit with the higher ABV and slight bite of alcohol on the finish.  Good but not great in my mind. I'll have no problem finishing up the 4 pack, but it will likely be some time before it makes the rotation again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,broken22,4.6,"I'm a big fan of Dogfish Head's more obscure brews. I really think that the owner just can't get enough beer and we all benefit greatly from this. Since I'm only every drinking their more obscure creations I felt it was finally time to pick up a 4 pack of one of their regular beers that helped put them on the map and give it a taste.  So without hesitation I pop the top and pour a glass. I fluffy white head forms at the top. Its not real thick foamy head but one that grants you access to the beer without much waiting. I always smell the beer first and this one smells good. I was really expecting a strong smell of hops than what I smelled. However that being said it did have a well crafted smell that was sweet and slightly bitter at the same time. Taking the first sip and the taste is good. The taste mimics the smell in that there is not much bite from the hops. This would have to be one of the more mild IPA's I have had. That being said like with the smell the taste is complex. Its sweet, bitter, and hoppy at the same time. You get a little bit of a sugared grapefruit like taste. Overall mouthfeel is normal nothing really special to mention. The drinkability of this beer very good.  I really enjoyed this beer. I can tell why this was voted best beer in some poles they mention on the packaging, its really good. So if you haven't had this beer yet try it. I'm sure you will like it as its very approachable for many different beer drinkers. My local stores are selling this for $9.00 for a quad pack.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,JednoPivoProsim,4.27,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into an Ommegang tulip. Bottled on (hard to read) 12/17/10?  Appearance: Not a huge head to speak of, but otherwise a decent looking beer. Nice clear amber to gold hue. Good carbonation activity. Head receded quickly.  Smell: Very citrusy hop character. Smells pleasing and inviting.  Taste: Big points here! Ideal citrus taste - grapefruit would certainly fit the description. I feel like this is something you might find at the juice bar of a hotel continental breakfast buffet. And for 9% alcohol, I really don't taste the booze, which is a plus.  Mouthfeel: I'm surprised how light this beer feels. I was expecting something a lot more viscous (and, yes, I did have to double check the definition of viscous.) Good, prickly carbonation.  Drinkability: I'll mark this down slightly, but only because of the advertised ABV. Otherwise, I could see putting away a few of these only to have it catch up on me and cause problems.  Overall: A great beer. Drinking this beer slightly chilled masks a lot of the alcohol. As it warms up I start to taste and smell more of the booze, however.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,EricCioe,3.69,"For my 50th review, I'm doing the most popular beer on the site.  This pours a reddish copper color with a nice white head that fades down to a ring and an island with good lacing. A nice beer to look at. On the nose there is a strange note that I've had in other beers, sometimes to a fault, that I can't put my finger on. Wild mushrooms, brussel sprouts? That really dominates the nose for me, not necessarily detrimental but not my favorite nose, either. In the mouth that wild mushroom note transforms into a biggish hop presence, not super citrusy or piney but sweet with a tingle, with some other sweet tones like grapefruit coming through later. In the mouth those flavors linger on in a medium body with the hops and carbonation keep prickling on for a while. It's quite drinkable for a DIPA, and the alcohol is hidden pretty well. Overall, pretty good. Not my favorite due to the nose, but a worthy beer for sure.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,SolomonGrundy,4.43,"So funny, I was SURE that I had reviewed this already but nope!!!  Pours a super-clear copper, well carbonated and forms a wonderful, soapy head that leaves plenty of nice, corrugated lacing. Beautiful...Lots of sweet malty and sugary aromas. I get some brown sugar, some caramel, a dash of vanilla, and some grapefruit peel in the background...nicely balanced and complementary aromas...so far, close to an elite ale...Flavor is incredible...It's not just a hop bomb, either. The sweet, malty body is nicely subdued by the strong hoppy bitterness in the late middle and finish. A very strong grapefruit juice component arises right away, hides for a spell, then reappears in the finish. No one flavor dominates and they meld well together, without clashing against each other like a sword on a shield. Carbonation dances on your tongue like sunshine (that's for you, SJ). This is elite and wonderful beer. Well-priced at $9.99/4-pak and 9% ABV. Probably one of the best beers I've ever had. You MUST have some in your beer fridge at all times for guests....  What I like most: the wonderful, complementary and not overpowering flavor profile.  What I like least: almost nothing (except maybe the availability now that ""Brewmasters"" has been airing).  Verdict: One of the World's finest ales and a must have for every beer lover. Near to perfect.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

A - good looking IPA, deep golder/amber coloring, medium (1 finger) head with a slow dissipation into a foamy eggshell lacing.  S - Floral and spice and all things nice. Slight alcohol presence in the nose as well as a bit of coffee, which I personally find pretty unique and awesome for the style.  T - Malty frontend, then the hops come in the middle and back. Pine, some citrus (likely grapefruit), and more spices that were prominent in the nose.  M - Medium body, ok carbonation, again some alcohol present here but it's not too detrimental to the brew overall.  D - Yup, pretty solid, love the coffee nose.

One of THE BEST beers I have ever tried, and for the record I am not a huge fan of the 60min.  A - Pours a beautiful clear golden color with a white lacy head that leaves behind traces of itself upon drinking.  S - Smells like the beautiful nutty, citrusy, piney hops it was brewed with. Can't be the aroma.  T - For a beer that has a ton of IBU it doesn't taste like it. The flavors are balanced perfectly and I don't use that world lightly at all.  M - The only place that was below perfect to me. Had a slight alcohol burn to it but all in all was very pleasant and hit different flavors in different areas of the mouth.

10099,2093,micromaniac129,4.95,"A bright crystal clear beer. The color is amber with golden hi lights under a 2 finger thick head. When it fades and it never truly faded, it produces nice thick wispy veils that explode with every disturbance of the beer. Very good beligum lacing. Aroma is that of citrusy and flora lhops and hints of pine resin. The aroma is not bold and in your face but well reserved and confident. Sweet malts boost up the hop aroma. A very well balance beer. The malts have a sweet flavor with some underlying breadiness. The hops are excellent they balance out nicely. Hops have a flavor of citrus and pine with hints of floral tones. Medium mouthfeel that is very smooth. A slightly dry finish with a hoppy bitterness that lingers deep into the after taste. Alcohol? What alcohol. You wouldn't even know that it's there. A perfectly made beer that is in perfect harmony. I read reports that this could be the best beer in the world and I'm inclined to agree. I think this beer is the best there is.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

A - golden brown in color, one finger whittish head that does not stay long with a minute amount of lacing. T - one of the first craft beer I tasted and the first double IPA, and it's great. Very hoppy with enough burn on the palate, and will still appreciate the citrusy, herbal, malty, sweet flavors that's within this great brew. M - medium to full bodied, perfect with spicy foods. Starts and finish with enough bitterness but no aftertaste for me. Just right. D - if your palate is in to the hops that's twice the amount or more than regular beer, then this is for you.

10099,2093,Bouleboubier,4.08,"bottled 12/10/10 - poured inna tulip  Startled (been awhile I guess) to find that this pretty much tastes like a ""doubled"" version of the 60 Min - duh! Swear this had a denser malt and hop constitution, and it may have once or twice before - I did have this a couple times via Randall (equating malt sweetness with hop syruposity?).  Pours a little spritzy/champagne-like - clean-filtered brassy gold - HUGE foamy 2"" head with a pale saffron color and fab retention, crystalline lacing. Smells like the 60 Min, too - hops especially, just more regal and whiskey-like. Punchy baked malt caramel aroma. The hops fume dense and pungent (reminds me a little of Hop Wallop) while an isopropyl hooch faintly pokes through. The taste recalls the 60 Min as well (duh redux), only now the hops and malt have been separated a few hairs. Not that this drinks dry, per se. The Hop Wallop similarity retains, though this definitely sports a lasting, building cookier(?) biscuit maltiness. Hops are assertively piney with some zippy clementine/grapefruit citrus colors but not firmly bitter. Phenol whispers.  Mouth action: fairly clean, split on a dry/malty finish - leans toward dry w/o being sharp or rough (brings out the hops). Mild after-effects of booze felt - a little hot. It all drops off lovely with that sweetness only lingering, thin.  Damn! More drinkable than i remember. I could actually knock back 2-3 of these. Oh no...",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Not overly frangrant.  T-Follows smell closely, the citrus quickly ceding to the piney and quite resinous hop background. The malt is well done, but quite strong for even a DIPA. Alcohol warmining but well hidden.  M- Thick and rich, quite nice.  D- I seem to get tired of this after a single bottle, probably because I'm just not crazy about this level of maltiness in an IPA.

T - Starts quite sweet, fruity and malty with the hops coming in during the middle of the taste, building up a balanced bitterness. Finishes dry with a faint alcohol warmth.

Rich, thick and sweet on the attack, a real mouthful of an IPA. This is so rich and sweet with a boozy toffeeish finish. Alcohol is masked by all the sweetness but it's almost like a 9% Belgian in terms of it's weight. For me, this is tasty but it steps outside the realm of everything I like about American IPA's, bold assertive bitterness and hoppiness that balance a huge malt bill and keep you coming back for more. Here the palate is just too sticky and sweet to make this at all sessionable. Actually difficult to finish a 10oz pour.

Bright white foamy head with tons of lacing as it fades away.  S- Pink Grapefruit, tangerine, sweet malty bread, honey, tangy hops, and a touch of alcohol. It seems I can smell a different type of hop each time I swirl the glass and re-sniff. Heady aroma... really fruit forward that changes as it warms.  T- Honey, malts, citrus, and slightly bitter hops. Sparkling carbonation that tickles the tongue. I don't see how this can get any better, but it does as it warms up. Grassy, clean, and sweeter than alot of IPA's.  M- Great balance of bittering hops, and fruity, bready sweetness. I love the way the sweet honey, carbonation, and hoppiness mix.

Knowing beforehand that this beer was packing 90 IBU's, I was expecting very intense hop bitterness, but soon found out that wasn't the case. The hop flavor is not overpowering and plays very well with the maltyness. This beer is actually very sweet too, which masks some of the bitterness you would expect from a 90 IBU IPA.

10099,2093,evanlarkin,4.05,"Appearance: Light-amber or copper colored. Fairly clear. When first poured not much of a head, but about 10-15 seconds after pouring it rose up to about 1/2"" and then quickly settled back down.  Smell: Hops, hops and more hops! And grapefruit. Smells a tad more sweet than your average IPA. A definite amarillo/simcoe combination. Looking it up, it also contains warrior hops, which don't come through in the aroma quite as clearly as the others.  Taste: Very sweet while your lips are still on the glass, followed by a buildup of bitterness. That's where the warrior hops went. A bit like a sour grapefruit, though meant in a complementary way. As the bitterness resides the high alcohol content becomes apparent. While not overwhelming, it definitely tells you that you're not drinking a regular pale ale.  Mouthfeel: Reasonably smooth, somewhat creamy. The carbonation tickles the tongue a bit, and if it were flatter the creaminess would really come through. The feeling sticks in your mouth for a bit, which is nice because it lets you enjoy this 9% beer a bit more slowly, but still taste and feel it.  Drinkability: Everything but the ABV and the price makes it very drinkable. If you're a hophead you could probably drink several, but the ABV will limit you if you have to drive home, and the price per 4 pack will limit you if you're on a budget.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,wcintula,4.32,"An incredible beer poured into a perfect pint. A very heavy, hazy beer, the head almost seemed weighed down, but was well retained. The smell is just a beautiful bouquet of hops and the taste is that with the malty well-balanced sweetness. You can notice the higher alcohol content, but in a nice, warming way like you would in a wine. The beer is thick and velvety, super pleasant, and well enjoyed.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,SirRuss,4.25,"A - A fine haze runs throughout the deep, rich copper body indicating a malty treat ahead. The head is solid, if ephemeral, but leaves some sexy lacing to the last drop.  S - Wow. Straight away those coppery malts breeze up the glass, and are soon followed by a complimentary whiff of resinous hops. There's also a creaminess on the backdrop, but what gets me most is the gentle nature of this brew's aroma. It doesn't make you work for it, but at the same time the senses are in no way bombarded. It's a seductive style that leaves you hankering for more.  T - Wow again. No word of a lie came from the aroma. This is a gentle giant with a suspiciously silver tongue. The malts are first on the scene. and express themselves delicately at first, with shortbread nuances on the fore-palate. Almost immediately they roll into a richer, bicuity character reminiscent of a decadent cheesecake base. While you're trying to wrap your head around the unctuous malt transition, the hops flank the rest of your palate as they increase their presence in a similarly smooth maneuver. United, the perfect balance of hops and malt command a peculiar onslaught, allowing huge - massive - flavors to seem somehow mild, and completely palatable. The finish is yet another melange equally comparable to the midpalate and nose, and then finally settles down on a soft piney bed.  M - Like a giant multicolored feather duster, this brew will softly reach every nook of your senses. The malty sweetness creates a momentary stickiness, as does the oiliness of the mega hops. But the 9% -which can only be detected indirectly through its negation of that stickiness - cuts everything back into balance as it collaborates with the very diplomatic carbonation. The clotted cream hinted at by the nose also comes forth in the mouth and palate, and lends a further luxurious layer to the mouthfeel.  D - Although the brilliance of this brew is in its balance, which is a more sophisticated illusionist than Dan Brown - or dare I say it, Houdini himself - the one thing it can't do is fool you for long. After mustering the discipline to leave more than a millisecond between each sip, you finally come down to earth and realize its true weight is more than most people can handle beyond the first bottle. Of course, for those of us with less self-restraint, there's always the issue of 9% and real gravity to act as a secondary natural check, and lliterally bring you down to earth by less gracious means.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

It has a nice caramel color and lots of pin point bubbles rise quickly to a thick off-white head that dissipates rather quickly.  The citrus aroma was subtler than I expected from a strong IPA, but the caramel-malty scents were a pleasant surprise. I even got a hint of chocolate.  A first sip, I got a sharp initial bitterness that quickly quieted down to a heavenly taste of butterscotch.The mouthfeel is creamy and not too carbonated.

Smell: A pleasantly distinctive hoppy, citrus/fruity smell  Taste: A noticeable sweetness at the start followed by a dry hop bitterness which starts slow but quickly builds to a very pronounced level with some alcohol warmth. Although it's a strong tasting beer, it doesn't go too far in any one way, even the bitterness although extreme in itself feels very much at home here.  Mouthfeel: Light carbonation, feels slightly denser, almost silky in mouthfeel compared with other beers. I think the carbonation is just right.  Drinkability An absolutely exquisite beer.

Earthy hops, with some citrus and pine blend seemlessly into a sweet, slightly roasty and bready malt flavor. Although there are lots of hop flavors to keep the hophead happy, one has to pull them out rather than be hit in the face with them.

Dogfish Head has always been known for making delicious hoppy beers and you obviously don't appreciate beers of this caliber, and that's fine, but do us all a favor and stick to the styles that you like and are excited to review instead of giving us shitty reviews on great beers that YOU don't enjoy or know little about, it's a bit arbitrary.  I picked this up while vacationing in Florida at a beer bar called ""World of Beer."" I have always been a fan of Dogfish Head but since I live in a place with little beer culture and alcohol purity laws, it's a bit hard to find the rare and exotic. When I saw this, I grabbed it immediately.  Appearance: Poured a golden orange with nice white head and with decent lacing.  Smell: The nose is rich of citrus, like grapefruit, sweet malts, and big hoppy presence.  Taste: Big hop presence but I found it to be fairly smooth and no ado much dry. Big citrus taste and the back end of the flavor is great too, again real smooth with a little alcohol flavor.  Mouthfeel: Thick and semi-syrupy. Leaves your mouth longing for a glass of water and another sip.  Drinkability: The high ABV inhibits the drinkability a little bit but the hoppy flavor leaves you wanting more and more.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Bottled on 12/03/10  A: 3/4"" head into sme decent lacing. slightly darkend ambr color.  S: maybe my favorite part of this beer. A piney smell, with a back bone of of citrus and tropical fruit. the piney-ness mellows as the beer warms, and the fruity fragrance reigns.  T: not my thing here. While I liked the smell, the flavor is almost a cloying pine followed by bitterness to me. I get a little of the citrus, but not enough to balance out for me.  M: very little carbonation. coats my mouth and leaves a stickiness I find a bit unusual.  D: I can see why this is popular, but just not my thing. Goes down well for a 9% though. Would not buy again, but may drink if available.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Aroma was more subdued than I expected. Pine was most noticeable with a bit of citrus & malt.  Bold balanced flavors. A lot of pine & citrus with a really solid malt backbone & sweetness. Some bitterness by not overly bitter. This is a very balanced IIPA. Lots of hop flavor but a strong malt presence and not too much palate deadening bitterness.  Mouthfeel is rich without being overly thick. Quite drinkable for a IIPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

This beer pours noticeably darker than the 60 (duh) and the head is much slower to build, lacing is tight and sticky  The hops are still there and very present with big citrus and pine notes.  Tastes wonderful, but there is some unpleasant ethanol sting within the beautiful beverage  Feels great and drinks okay, it's a little hard for me to see myself having more than one because of the higher ABV  Chad",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Ive learned to like the look... Every time I see this I know what's in store for me... With no sediment you can pour to a perfect head that laces the glass all the way down... Pefect  This is the only beer I can smell after I've taken a sip... The smell of hops and sweet pine... Grape fruit, oooo I smell sugar... Back to pine... I smell C02?? BEST smelling beer ever  The tastes have a hoppy bite with little bitterness... All the flavor in the world with noooo compromise...hops and pine... When I read that people tasted pine i was like ""keep my Christmas tree out of my beer"". You won't believe the the balance there is.. If you search you can find the sweet malts which makes this a complex beer... Every time I drink this I find new tastes... Perfect imperial ipa..  Great carbonation.. Leaves you feeling thirsty wanting more  I have a 4 pack in my shop, kitchen, and office... When me and father have a beer after work you can't ask for a better treat.. Drinks way to easy for 9%  Notes: dont try to convert a stout drinker over to this hoppy beer... Start with something a little tame... This is the only reason I can think this doesn't have a near perfect score... People who say this goes good with food... I would recomend a thirsty friend to share this with before a meal..

10099,2093,nataku00,3.91,"Bottle (dated 12/13/2010, drank on 1/8/2011) poured into a tulip glass. Clear dark orange beer that I coaxed a half a finger of off white soapy head from the pour. The head dissipates to the surface, leaving a soapy surface that laces nicely on the glass when you swirl the beer around. Tons of carbonation streaming from the bottom of the glass is clearly visible, due to some nucleation etched onto the bottom of the glass.  Nose is pretty mediocre even after warming it up a little from fridge temperatures. Some dank piney and grassy hops, sweet mandarine orange, and some malt caramel as well.  Taking a sip, the dank pine and herbal hops hit the tongue first, then some citrus and light tropical fruit. Finishes a bit sweet and syrupy. Just a shot of bitterness initially, otherwise, not too much hoppy flavor in this.  Medium body beer, with a decent amount of carbonation contributing to a clean tongue after each sip. Not much of an aftertaste, maybe some feint citrus sweetness.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,basica,4.15,"A - Pours an orange-amber color into my snifter glass with a pretty two-finger thick foamy white head that recedes fairly quickly; moderate carbonation could be observed beneath (4)  S - Citrusy and grapefruity aromas from the hops with some hints of malt sweetness (4)  T - Sweet malts upfront on the palate, quickly giving way to citrusy and grapefruity hop flavors in the middle slowly fading off towards a clean finish which was just very slightly bitter. The taste comes across as very balanced, with flavors that a DIPA should have but without too much of anything as well (4)  M - Between thin and medium bodied, and just slightly sticky or syrupy, probably to a lesser extent than what one may expect for a DIPA; comes with moderate carbonation and a foamy smooth texture going down extremely easy (4.5)  D - This one's very drinkable for a DIPA and the 9% is just on the label and nowhere in the beer. Its almost flawless balance of flavors lends further credence to its high drinkability; definitely a great DIPA to introduce to anyone new to the style. Nonetheless, I would prefer a tad more fruitiness and hops in my DIPAs (4.5)  This bottle was acquired from the Asia Beer Fest 2010 in Singapore",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,cmq103,4.28,"A: Poured into a Sam Adams Boston Lager Perfect Pint glass to view a medium copper color with slight haziness. Very little head, but nice lacing that clung to the sides of the glass leaving perfect art work as my glass emptied (way to easily I might add).  S: Clear hop presence but not overdone, followed by a sweet malty, herbal, citrus blend. I thought the hop presence would dominate, but not the case with this one. I would have liked a little more of a ""hop bite"" though if I'm being totally honest.  T: I first tasted the smooth sweet maltiness, followed by the not so overpowering hoppiness that reminded me of their 60 minute version. Again, I would have enjoyed a little more hop flavor. I figured with the higher ABV, the finishing bite might be a bit too much, but definitely not the case for this DIPA.  M: A little thicker on the tongue, moderate carbonation. Overall this was very smooth...  D: This a dangerous brew. I could find myself easily enjoying two or three, as the ABV is very well hidden. Certainly not a session beer though. This is a must for anyone who enjoys DIPA's like I do. Dollar for dollar, I will stick with the 60 minute version though. Well struck Dogfish Head Brewery, well struck.

10099,2093,OhYesILoveBeer,3.23,"DFH 90 into DFH Globe @ 47*. Pours dark golden with a off white head. Smell is floral with a touch of sweetness to back it up, not too common in a IIPA. Taste is almost cloying sweet with slight hop notes. I'm not sure whats going on with this beer but it's just not on par with other examples of the style. I got a deal on a 4pk @ $7.99 so I figured I'd see what all the hype was about. I cant understand why the package is labeled as being ""One of the best IPA's in America"", when this beer is more closely related to Red Brick's Brown Ale. Overall I guess it was a ""ok"" buy.. Not really impressed, seeing as there are way better examples of the style out there. I'd pass this one up when looking for a nice IIPA. Southern Tier's XIPA blows this beer away by all means. I just think that DFH is a big fad now and on the verge of being a house trend.

10099,2093,hopshopshops,4.1,"This is a hard beer to review. The reason is the taste is quite different from the West Coast IPA's (Torpedo, Green Flash, Racer 5) or DIPA's (Pliny E, Hop Stoopid, Hop Sauce) that I favor, and I want to be fair.  This is really a very good beer: the finish, the mouth feel, the carbonation, the body, are quite exceptional.  It's the taste. Not that its bad; it's different. I suspect the huge malt infusion along with a hop blend that is likely different than the 3 C's and Simcoe that predominate West Coast varieties, creates this taste. In a nutshell, the taste is sweet raisiny (almost prunish) hop/malt flavor, so predominate that it muzzles the hop bitterness. The taste is so distinct, that in a blind test of IPA's, I can't imagine not distinguishing this beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,generalnotsew,3.57,"Bright honey coloring in the body but the head was a bit disappointing. The pour was fairly aggressive but still with no results. Smell is very sticky sweet honeysuckle with a twist of pineapple. Not the least bit bitter in the nose. This is a very rich, malty smelling IPA. Last 2 times I had this I was quite let down. And I mean one from this current four pack I am drinking now. Bottled on 12/17/10 so it is pretty damn fresh. First beer of the night so I am able to take time with it. This is much more bitter than I recall. Not as sickening sweet either. Could be because it is fairly cold. But there is quite a hop bite with huge pineapple and some sour green apple. I can sense the caramel like malts but they are subdued a bit to the cold. The aftertaste is something I don't care for. The sweetness linger far after the bitterness but I do like it more than the first time I had it. If it weren't for the sweetness I could see drinking a fair bit of these. All in all a solid IPA but I still get why it is so great to most people.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,r0nyn,4.2,"Poured from a 32 oz growler into my DFH snifter (what else?).  Pours a really pretty orangeish amber that's pretty transparent. Thinnish white head that dissipates rather quickly, leaving lots of sticky, spotty lacing. Sweetish citrus smell, with a lot of maltiness and a light floral and fruity character. Not a lot of hops, which is surprising. I don't really mind, to be honest!  Taste starts off rather sweetly, which is again, surprising. Lots of malts and sweet fruits to begin the flavor experience, followed up by the big citrus hoppiness. Bitterness takes over and lingers long into the aftertaste. Alcohol really isn't evident in the taste, as the bitter hops take center stage over pretty much everything. The balance between bitter and malty isn't quite even, but it manages to achieve a nice tastiness. Mouthfeel is on the light-to-medium side. It sits nice on the tongue with a tiny bit of effervescent carbonation and a good bit of oomph to it.  Drinkability is pretty good. I'm not a hophead by any stretch of the imagination, but this is a pretty darn drinkable IPA. Yeah, it's bitter, but it's still got a good balance of hops and malts. You'll feel that hefty alcohol though, so make sure you pace yourself.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Aroma: Toasty malt with the floral backing of hops Flavor: Thick, bitter, and hoppy. Bitterness dominates the whole sip, with some relative sweetness being released towards the biscuity finish as the palate becomes more used to the intensity of the hops. MF: For an imp.

One-finger head on the pour, which dissipated after about 5 minutes.  S: Lots going on - very fruity from the hops, with some citrus but even apples or melons as well. Some floral as well - marigolds?  T: Sweet up front, with those fruit flavors. Bitterness on the back, but the overall lingering taste is definitely more sweet and malty than bitter.  M: Smooth, not too much carbonation.  D: Sweetness and hops hide the alcohol fairly well. Personally I don't find this as drinkable as the 60-minute, though it certainly packs less of a whollop than the 120.

Amazingly complex.  As with the smell, the taste is powerful. A rich maltiness and overwhelming hop flavours. Very bitter but balanced by considerable malty sweetness - sweeter than expected. Fruity and spicy notes. A smooth creamy mouthfeel that coats the tongue and leaves a lingering taste. Delicious!  A superb beer - top notch. A taste that isn't to be forgotten quickly.

Crystal clear golden hue, with moderate off-white head. Head has average retention, although the ample carbonation makes for a long-lasting top coat.  This is an intensely hoppy beer with a very high IBU (90!). It has a readily detectable malt component, landing a hint of honey but only enough sweetness to partially counter the hops, leaving a pronounced bitterness that's typical strength for the style. Hop flavor starts piney and ends with grapefruit but less bitterness than expected thanks to a generous malt load. Nice hoppy finish and aftertaste.

First sip is of a rather subdued hop bitterness, more malty sweet. Not what I was expecting from the aroma. Malty sweetness is caramelly. Based on the theory on how this beer is made, not sure why more hop flavor doesn't come through.  Mouthfeel is medium, with chewy malt, a slight hop bitterness compared to the maltiness.

Piney (with a slight citrus bite) hops initially. They sit all the way past the middle of the drink. Grapefruit comes though as mouthfeel rounds towards the end of the drink. Lingering dry finish of piney hops and mild tobacco. Nothing too complex.  M - Creamy mouthfeel becomes syrupy. Tingle of carbonation at the start loses the battle to the full, coating mouthfeel.

It truly is a ""sneaky"" 9% beer that doesn't taste like one.  I usually buy a case of this beer when I visit the brewery. Its just that good. Also great when run through Randall.

M- Nice, again after warming up.  D- Way too boozy. I tend to stay down in the 7% range, so that's just my preference. The higher ABV made this quite harsh and didn't appear to be well hidden at all.  Overall, I've had this beer many times on draft and from a bottle and I just feel it's overrated. Every time I bust out $10 for a 4-pack thinking it'll be different and my tastebuds have gained refinement, I'm always disappointed. There are so many other better variations of a DIPA.

Unfortunately, it is only hopped with one type of hops, which makes it difficult to drink after one bottle, and the malt undertone is very strong. I think it was an attempt to balance a style that is defined by unbalanced flavor.  I think stylistically, it is a miss for DFH. They take a lot of chances within each beer, and some are hits and some are misses. Overall, this beer is a hit, but this choice is a bit of a miss.  This beer has a harsh alcohol finish which lowers the drinkability, but this is more of an Imperial IPA, than it is this particualar ale.

10099,2093,trevorjn06,4.07,"Pours a clear copper color with a very thin layer of foam on top.  Aroma is citrusy, fruity and grassy North American hops with British toasty, bready malts backing.  Taste is well balanced between sweet, bready malts and aromatic, bitter hops. The taste follows the nose quite a bit with fruity, citrusy hops and sweet, toasty, grainy malt. The bitterness in this IPA is much smoother than most and this contributes to easy drinkability and a very nice balance. The finish leaves hints of hop flavors and bready malts on the tongue.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation.  Overall this is a bit sweeter than most IPAs and has less hop aromatics but it is well balanced and easy drinking (for it's strength).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Lots of malt character with some spicy hops that are well balanced.  Nice very bitter upfront taste that mellows extremely well from fruity to sweet caramel/earthy malty and leaves a nice bitter very defined hop residue.

10099,2093,TCHopCraver,4.38,"Reviewed from notes made on 12/15/10.  90 Minute pours a see through golden-amber-orange with a very light tan, half finger head into a big 'ol snifter. I love the color of this beer. The head retains well with a full-covering film. Carbonation bubbles are small, scurry at a swift walk, and rise in stingy lines. The lacing is attractive and reminds me of foam in the wake of a boat.  Every kind of hop aroma exists in this beer - bitter grapefruit, sweeter citrus, tropical fruit, flower, pine, and grass. You name it, it's in there. Standing up to the hops is a formidable caramel malt aroma. Biscuit and bread crust round out a really solid smell.  The ""ridiculous amount of English Two-row Barley"" that the label speaks of is very evident in the taste. However, the hops lead off the flavor parade with aggressive floral, grass, and citrus flavors on the sides of my mouth. Then the sweet caramel malts drop a bomb on my tongue and play there for a long time. Finally, the bittering hops join forces with the copious malt for a lingering semi-sweet, but mostly bitter end.  The mouthfeel is so biting from the hops, but also creamy and full-bodied for an Imperial IPA from the huge malt presence. The carbonation complements the body perfectly. I really enjoy how this beer plays my palate.  This is so drinkable! I will definitely have repeated imbibings of this beer over time. I have never been disappointed by this beer and its groovy yumminess. The hop and malt combination is phenomenal and I daresay that I could have several in a sitting.

The carbonation has a nice zing to your tongue. Perhaps it's me but the taste just doesn't do much for me. The taste seems a bit fruity but sour. This is my third bottle because I wanted to be sure I wasn't missing something after all the rave reviews I've seen about this one. To be honest I'm disappointed in this one.

Lots of sticky lacing  Spicy, Floral aroma with an almost candy like sweetness and alcohol from the generous malt.  Very well balanced. Not what I expected at all (I guess I expected the hops to be much more assertive), but in a good way. Very malt forward, alcohol, sweetness, hops come at the end of the swallow and last until the next drink.  Scary drinkable at 9%ABV. Carbonation  stings the tip of the tongue each sip.

M: Perfect carbonation, well-crafted to stay balanced with the flavor  D: Could knock back a few of these every time, but if your not accustumed to IPA's then maybe not as good as I have it rated.

Hops, pine, citrus and a slight caramel malt background in the aroma. Of smells like an IPA should smell like.  Hops are the main attraction but the malts aren't playing hide and go seek. Despite the slight alcohol taste, it's pretty good.  Carbonation is noticeable in the mouth but not annoying. Body is not heavy at all. Feels nice in the mouth and gives a nice warm feeling going down.  I could have another one no problem, in fact I am. A decently high ABV with a nine percent, it could be a factor into wanting a third one.  Overall, I do like this beer and I would love to try it on tap. I don't agree with it being, perhaps the best IPA in America, as it mentions on the box; it's good, but ain't damn good.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Smell reminds me of a hop-forward, boozy barley wine.  Tastes a little weird compared to most of the IPAs I've had. Very malty and sweet. It's a little too sweet, feels like there is sugar melting my enamel, not very pleasant. It's pretty juicy, but it's just so sweet and boozy that I can't enjoy it. Not what I look for in an IPA.  the mouthfeel is nice. Chewy and well-carbonated.  Drinkability is low, it feels like I'm drinking a 12% beer.

A: Pours a light, slightly dusty copper with some hints of red; big, three-finger head of sudsy, white foam slowly dies down to a thin layer, but leaves some nice patches of crystally lace on the way down.  S: Piney hop nose... maybe some spicy hops, too; sweet malts and soaked bread crust; some alcohol (also spicy) is noticeable, too.  T: A strong caramel malt foundation provides a wonderful base for piney, slightly resiny (and ever-so-slightly zesty) hops; some alcohol in the finish that fades as the beer warms; maybe some white pepper in there, too? Very spicy hoppiness to this beer, which the hint of alcohol seems to encourage.  M: Full-bodied with perfect, low-moderate carbonation; sublime mouthfeel on this beer; viscous; SMOOTH.  D: Very drinkable for the style... Its a bit of a ""spicy"" double IPA (due to both the hops and alcohol), but very well balanced and oh so smooth on the finish.

Head dissipated quickly to a nice dusting  Smell - (still struggle with smell) but a very nice, strong base  Taste - i recently moved back to IPA's since ive gotten used to the hoppiness since my college days, but i was floored how balanced this brew is. nice citrus tones with a slight sweetness that finishes very hoppy. very surprised by the balance, ridiculous in fact.  M - nice velvety texture. almost like a thin elixir.  D - im a big dude, so i can put these away, and that is frightening because how drinkable this brew is.  Overall - Best IPA ive ever had so far.

M: Medium body but leaves a real nice coating in the mouth.  Very good IPA that differs in from the West Coast versions mostly in the flavors of the hops and in presence of the malt.

M: Sticky and fulll mouthfeel.  D: I pounded this glass. Even with the noticeable alcohol kick it was quite drinkable. But it is 9% so I'm not going to go crazy with this one.  4's across the board for this brew. It was really nice and I really appreciated the malt backbone on this brew.

However, the draw of this beer is the excellent clarit to go with it's beautiful amber body with some orange and red notes. An enticingly beautiful beer body.  The nose is filled with piney hops. Probably some Simcoe.  The taste is relatively clean and hop forward. The pine comes through again... though I personally would like to see some more citrus here. The beer finishes surprisingly sweet, almost bordering on cloying at times. The hops and malt balance each other well, but I'm not overly impressed with either. The beer's depth is what gives it the higher score in taste relative to mouthfeel and drinkability, but I'm just not overly impressed.

Smell- The citrus-y smell hit me as soon as I popped the cap. Grapefruit! It smelled as if I cut a grapefruit in half and sniffed the juice.   Taste- was medium to heavy bodied (which I thought to be a pleasant surprise from an IPA)- the hoppiness/bitterness were the initial taste, yet finished citrusy sweet.  Aftertaste- Grapefruit! the aftertaste was like I just drank the juice from a grapefruit.  Conclusion- This is by far the best IPA I've had- still not a huge fan of IPAs, but at least I know now that not all IPAs are like drinking a glassful of urine lol- I can honestly say I will enjoy the rest of my glass, but that will be it.

Taste: If from the bottle, you can immediately taste a grapefruit prescence-quite sweet but not too much, which is quickly followed by the alcohol's warm.

On the palate this is a ripper. Decadent, sweet bitter and full-on. The flavours hit every corner of your mouth and all sides of your tongue finishing long. Would definitely pick this up again if it was available easily, locally.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Bendurgin,3.97,"All day at work today I was had a hankering for some hops. So I stopped and grabbed this guy on my way home. Poured into a tulip. The beer pours light amber with a thin layer of white head with good sticky lacing. The aroma is a big pine/cut grass pine aroma with notes of tropical fruit and a slight malt backbone peaking through. It's downright difficult to get my nose out this beer. My fist sip completely assaults my taste buds with bitter and dry piney hops. After a short recovery a nice balanced malt presence is noticeable. The mouthfeel is a little rugged, nice body but I think big hop bombs like this tend to be aggressive on the pallet (I know how obvious that is). Overall the drinkability is nice, the ABV slows me down a bit but this one is a solid go-to IPA for myself.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Aroma is extremely hoppy but softer than the really big boys of this style, Ruination and Hop Stoopid come to mind with their 100 level IBUs. Alcohol is very well hidden. What strikes me about this beer is the balance-, it is exceptionally aligned. Best IPA/DIPA in America? No, but I'd put it in the top ten, which is significant. If you don't have a great local IPA or don't have access to a store with a diverse selection, this might be the default great IPA that is available, as I've even been seeing Dogfish Head in chain groceries lately.

Smell: Citrusy smell of hops. Fresh, not sour or tart. Reminds me of the smell of a summer afternoon when I was living in Florida.  Taste: The bitterness jumps onto your tongue and then backs off before being too much. Sweet taste/aroma of malts come in after a second.  Mouthfeel: Overall not bad, but occasionally the alcohol seeped through and once, when I held the beer for a moment in my mouth, the bitterness left an almost cough-syrupy aftertaste. Nice and light beer. For all the carbonation activity in the glass, nothing out of the ordinary going on in the mouth.  Drinkability: Very nice beer, easy to drink and could do so with pleasure.

Burnt orange hued, slightly hazy with a very creamy and very dense off white head. Good head retention and lacing, signature DIPA looks on this one.  Aroma 3.5/5 Earthy and grassy hop aroma, like green leaves in mud but meant in a good way. Very different from other D/IPAs but not strong enough. Sweet malts are present too.

Smell is sweet, with a surprising lack of hops in the nose. As a side note this beer is more sweet than bitter. I'd say a pale ale is more bitter to me than this imperial IPA.  Citrus hits the edges of the tongue and a warm sweetness is immediately noted. The citrus zing fades and the caramel sweetness takes over. Caramel coated lemon candy is how I'd describe how the beer initially tastes.  You will detect alcohol, the one flaw I see in the beer is that the alcohol is not masked well enough, although that is a minor concern in a beer as flavorful as this one.  As the sweetness fades the hops take over. I mentioned that this wasn't an ultra hopped beer, but it's still an IPA. The hops have the same character as the 60 minute IPA, and have a citrus/tropical taste to them.  After I took my last sip the aftertaste brought a bit of smokiness.

Taste is of piney, oily hops forming the backbone of the beer, with very sweet malts rounding out the taste. The hops comes to the forefront of the palate, and rounds out the aftertaste. The alcohol is faintly noticeable, but it helps the beer have a warming feel on the way down. The mouthfeel is full bodied and thick, very rich.

T: Upfront hop bitterness. Very noticeable alcohol. Less sweetness in the malt than I expected. Bitter dry finish. It's probably classified as a ""balanced"" IPA, but I've had West coast IPA's with sweeter malt base and still came across as hoppier. Just my opinion.  M: Medium-to-Full body. Some carbonation, and very dry mouth feel.  D: Not bad. The alcohol is pretty noticeable and probably not as well harmonized with the other components as I'd like. With hoppiness it comes across a little astringent.  I had this about a year ago and remember totally loving it. Something is different this time.

The taste was interesting but not what i'd hoped for. Very very good on the first sip but then became flattish and finally just straight bitter. Lots of hops here, no doubt, but only good as the beer warmed. In fact, the balance was only present when the beer was room temperature, and then a nice malt/hop balance was there.  Very strongly bitter aftertaste, and a real boozy gash across the palate. Again, improved when it was warmer.  High alcohol and strong bitters is going to keep me from having a lot of this.  Disappointing, all in all.  Updated review  I had a 2nd bottle that was far better than the first. Excellent piney-woody hops and very well balanced with the malts.

The body is brilliantly clear, medium-dark ruby in color. Lacing is only fair but a subsequent pour into a pint glass produced a larger head and excellent lacing.  S & T: The hops are monstrous, heavily woody and full of fresh pine and resin aromas. 90 Minute IPA makes perfect use of dry hopping. The malts are no slouch either, presenting notes of heavily rendered caramel, toasted nuts and bread crust. The yeast quality stands out with deep aromas of dank earth and leather. Very complex and nothing short of beautiful. This brew is aerobics in olfaction. Warning of alcohol on the nose makes it no surprise that part of the 9% heat comes through to the palate. Again, very woody on the tongue, with slight hints of orange on the backend. The flavor is extended through residual sweetness which is more than less balanced by it's moderate bitterness.

10099,2093,thebrood1987,5,Reviewed this on tap now reviewing it out of the bottle. It smells like that piney hop smell that I'd expect out of a nicely hopped IPA plus with some fruit smells probably from the mixture of hops they use and the fruity yeast strain. The taste is that piney and citrus fruit flavor combined with a thicker more robust roasted malt flavor than the 60 minute. It still has that same malt flavor just a lot more of it so it comes off as richer tasting. The hops leave a nice resinous bite that mixes in with the citrus hops they use and that fruity alcohol yeast thing they have going on. This beer is amazing and one of the best tasting and ridiculously balanced Imperial IPA's ever. On tap it had a bit more bite but I'm sure if you get this super fresh in the bottle it will have that same effect.

The initial smell is of alcohol (9%), followed immediately by the malt character and rounded, full bodied hops. This beer has a complex aroma profile that seems to continue alternating between the three through the beers consumption.  T. The taste starts with the big malty sweetness that is quickly offset with the alcohol and hops. Since the hops are added continuously over 90 minutes, this beer displays a depth of hops not usually present in Imperial IPA's. While the flavors are all battleing with each other, they are all uniquely balanced with each other.  M. The mouthfeel is much heavier than the beer shows with its color. The beer seems to coat the mouth and linger longer than one would expect.  D. This DIPA is a wonderful beer, but not for the casual beer drinker.

A= This ale poured a hazed deep gold color with orangey highlights. The head rose just about 1/2"" and settled pretty quickly to a thin but dense cap. Tons of lace clung to my glass in rings and sheets. Pretty impressive stickage!  S= Lots of fresh hop smell, complete with the expected citrus and pine but also some nice leafy herbal character as well. A fair bit of boozy alcohol present along side sweet malt notes.  T= Started off with a quick burst of caramel malt sweetness then launched into the hop assault. Its more of a giant wave of hop flavor than a piercingly sharp hop bitterness. Hard to describe but I think its actually more hop flavorful and less hop bitter than 60 minute IPA. Boozy alcohol added some candy sweetness and complexity. Finished on the sweet side.  MF= Heavy side of medium bodied with a moderate carbonation level and feel.  D= A good/great beer for sure but the hot alcohol booziness that fades in and out takes away from the drinkability for me.

After having read the Bros. reviews, I'm wondering if there's something wrong with this one - not much lacing at all. I've had it before but I can't remember how much there was at that time.  Quite sweet-smelling; fruity phenols more than hops, a bit of honey and stone fruit and eventually some pine. An IPA shouldn't smell like this, but it IS nice.  Taste is a bit of a mash-up of hops, malt and booze. The 60-min IPA is pretty tight, whereas this seems unfocussed. Green, vegetal hops are up front but fade to the same level as too-sweet malt and very noticeable alcohol a few seconds later. Doesn't really feel like an IPA/DIPA. Oily and resinous in the mouth, could use a touch more carbonation but otherwise on point. Kind of heavy, overall. I don't really want another but probably wouldn't say no if you offered me one. Prefer the 60 Minute.  Edit: I should note, in light of all the recent controversy about grey market US imports, that the bottle reviewed was one. I'm keeping the review up because I have had both the bottled 60 and 90-minute IPAs on their native soil and the impressions I had of the bottles I purchased in Australia conform to those I had previously. The 60-min was great both times, the 90 muddled and disappointing.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,JohnnyChicago,4.1,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a chalice.  A: Amber-honey body with a white one finger head.  S: Very muted hops, honey and grapefruit. Very subtle all-around.  T: Taste follows the smell. The hops are pulling their punch and the balance is expertly crafted.  D: Very easy drinking for the big ABV. Everything goes down smoothly and the brew feels light and fluffy on the tongue.  Overall: This is a great East Coast DIPA. You can tell that their intention was to balance out the hops and hide the alcohol and in that regard it was an absolute success. Hopheads won't go gaga for this one, but that's not its purpose; its an easy drinking, malty, high ABV DIPA and a damn good one at that.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The head goes down, but stays pretty good til the bitter end  S- Very sweet as you would expect from an IPA with hoppy bitterness creeping in after a few deep draws  T- Cold i was hit immediately with a taste of coffee-like bitterness with hinds of cocoa. Very sweet finish that leaves the sour deliciousness on the back of your tongue for a while.  M- Very light, good amount of head as well as carbonation are a nice touch. It lingers the flavors quite while  D- A nice IPA, but a little too neutral for me. Nothing bold or exciting just a good all around beer.

It followed with a nice lacing that clings to the side of the glass as you drink through the brew  The aroma on this one is strong. The malt is what sticks out on the first nose. It has a sweet smell that reminds me biscuits and almost what be considered caramel/sugary. The hops is strong on this one, with some aromas of grapefruit, piney, orange peel, grassy/herbal hops and a bit of a peppery smell, which most likely comes from the alcohol.  This brew has an amazing flavor that can only be discribed as huge. You can't expect any less from a DIPA. The malts at the front of this brew give it a nice sweet flavor. They seem to be a bit biscuity, sugary/caramel like. The back of this brew is loaded with all kinds of hops. I might miss some, but they at least include, some Pine, grass, citris, spicy, herbal, and I might even get a salty kind of flavor in the mix. It give this brew a sweet and bitter flavor that gives it huge balance points.  The mouthful on this one is medium to full bodied. Its almost syrup like. The carbonination on this brew is perfect and it definitly helps with the hops profile, bring out a lot of the flavors at the bubbles, continue throughout the brew. It is very crisp and clean brew.  The only part of this beer that could lose any points would be in the drinkability of he brew. It's an amazing brew, with a high ABV. For those who can do a second of these, I am sure it wouldn't take much for them to do so.

Aggressively poured into a Duvel Tulip. Nice white frothy head.  Smell is a late comer. Might be a bit too cold. But as the beer warms up, the hoppy goodness comes through.  Taste. Out of this world goodness!! Like someone took a Bell's Two Hearted and kicked it up a couple notches.  Mouthful. A definite warming sensation in the mouth. Very tingly.  Drinkability. Given the 9 percent ABV, two might be my limit for the night. But it's two very unforgettable brews.  Very, very impressed. When I saw this and DFH's 60 min.

Surprisingly, the malt profile is the most prominent feature in the aromas, caramel and toffee scents, with just a hint of citrus hops. Malt forward in the taste too, with the hops finally showing themselves with a bitter, crisp finish. I prefer a much more hop forward profile in my IPAs & DIPAs, so this didn't do a whole lot for me, or blow me away like i thought it would (actually prefer the 60 Minute).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I love the way it smells. I get scents of orange and grapfruit, a little piney. The taste is pretty malty for a DIPA, but the hops do balance it out. There's also a slight caramel presense, maybe toffee as well. The mouthfeel is has a slight resin feel, but remains smooth; full-bodied. Drinkability is good, although this one can catch up to you. The aromas have you coming back for more.  Everytime I have a 90 Minute, it's a completely different experience.

Smell is dominated by the hops herbal citrusy piney all the wonderful hop smells that you would expect out od DIPA. Taste is bitter citrus and pine hops with a sweet malt backbone but the hop stays through from start to finish. Mouthfeel is clean and sharp, balanced carbaonation lends itself to the hops.

Sticky lace clings to the side of the glass and head retention is good.  Smell - 4.0 Surprisingly it is the malt that is first apparent upon sniffing. Smells very sweet, of biscuits and sugary fudge, with plenty of grapefuit, orange, pine needles, herbal and grassy hops, pepper from the alcohol.  Taste - 4.5 This is one seriously big beer (though it's a DIPA, so who's surprised?). Big, sticky and sweet with fudgy malt, a little caramel and an avalanche of hops; citrus, spicy, herbal, piney, even a little salty? Bitterness is high but in balance with the sweetness.  Mouthfeel - 3.5 Medium to full bodied, quite oily, syrupy and sticky, which is somewhat forgiveable in such a strong beer, but others do it better. Carbonation is light to moderate, perhaps more would lighten the body.  Drinkability - 3.5 I could drink a second of these, but I generally wouldn't choose to.

The head also leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass as well. It smells good, but I thought the hops were gonna stand out more. I also smell Caramel or Toffee. Really I think it smells pretty much like the 60 minute just a little stronger. Go figure. Taste is a amazing citrus hops that nice and present. good malty caramel taste, and a little bite of alcohol come in before the finish. Nice carbonation with a medium mouthfeel. Very drinkable beer. This is definitely one of my go to beers, it's just a great overall beer. I strongly recomend this beer to anyone.

S - The smell is pleasant - the citrus and hops are evident, but I expected a stronger aroma, to be honest.  T - POW. That was my first thought when the 90-minute hit my lips. I'm enjoying this beer immediately following the 60-minute IPA, and the flavor is like night and day. I do taste the 3% difference in alcohol content, that's for sure. There is a malty, bready essence that is dominant, the hops are sort of coming up the rear, but they do their job. This is a strong beer, and that is evident in the taste, but the flavors are balanced well and it's highly enjoyable.  M - Medium body and moderate carbonation.

Medium bodied with good carbonation.  d - Easy to drink, but the slight alcohol taste may scare some.  Recently had this on tap and it was so so much better. Tried it Randalled and not Randalled and it was amazing both ways. I guess I just don't love it in the bottle. I've bumped my scores up a bit to reflect my new thought.

10099,2093,eclaycamp,4.32,"Time to step things up a notch and try out the Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA. I've been holding onto this one for a couple of weeks but I figured I'd better drink it before it loses the majority of its hop characteristics. Pours kind of a tangelo orange brown, with very little head. Granted, I'm using a snifter for this one so I wasn't really looking for a big ass head. I might use a tumbler if I come across one of these again. Nose is an incredible detonation of hop aroma. Floral and citrus hops are there and there's this raisin sent underneath, almost like what you'd get out of a dark Belgian strong ale. Kind of surprising, actually. My first impressions while taking my sample is dang, this beer is smooth. It's very full, almost thick, with a slight alcohol burn in the finish. It's more well rounded and less sharp than the 60 minute IPA, especially in the finish. There's hops here, to be sure, and we'll catalog those in a moment, but I think it's important to note I actually think this may be less bitter than the 60 minute IPA. Either that, or the assload of malt that's in this lends a huge sweetness that helps you push through the bitterness. I mentioned the Belgian Strong earlier when talking aroma, and that comparison is valid when talking about the mouthfeel. It's thick, bordering on syrupy. Huge sticky lacing just coats the glass. Raisins are there in the taste too. It's extremely malt centric, with a roasted caramel syrup note that really sticks out for me. The hops are most certainly there in this one, with pine and orange rind coming out the more that you drink it. They're not as pronounced as I would like. Not sure if that's what the brewer intended, or because this one sat on the shelf for a while before I picked it up. Regardless, this is one phenomenal beer. As I said I'm not completely sold on it being a double IPA, but it's very good nonetheless.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,BaronRVH,4.8,This is one of my favorite IPAs around. I am always surprised when something with a high ABV tastes so well rounded and balanced. This beer is full-flavored with great balance and a really clean finish that makes you want more.  There are clear hops flavors but good malt and caramel notes. The thing I like most is how full-flavored it is but balanced by a great finish that cleans your palate.  This is outstanding with food especially steaks (like ribeyes or NY strip) or burgers. Also great with Buffalo chicken sandwiches or wings.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a decent amount of carbonation. Very smooth.  Drinkability: Very high drinkability. Because it is so well masked, the ABV could sneak up on you pretty quickly.

A - Nice amber color, mostly clear but a slight opaqueness to it. Pours with a nice, one finger head that really lasts quite a while. Leaves a nice lacing on the side of the glass.  S - A mixture of citrus (grapefruit), pine and hops...the holy grail!  T - Great hoppy, citrusy taste that isn't overpowered by the higher ABV. Although some may say it'is a a suped- up version of DFH IPA 60, this beer has a much richer taste in my opinion and hits you a whole lot harder in the palette.  M - Nice carbonation. Not what I would call ""thick"" but a heavier mouthfeel than the DFH IPA 60 or other IPA's I've had.  D - I love this beer!

However, some sweet malts and fruits go just a little bit too far. I'm all for a balanced IPA, but this winds up just a little bit too far into the realm of sweetness.  Mouthfeel: Feels a bit too thick with all the hoppy goodness going on.  Drinkability: It's a bit too sweet to drink too much. It does hide its alcohol well, but the sweetness wasn't something I was expecting from a beer hopped for 90 minutes.  This is a very good IPA, but not my favourite.

As one pops the cap, one is already greeted with the fleeting essence of pure, hoppy joy before the 90 minute even hits the glass!  As it pours, it displays a beautiful amber/copper color with a pleasant, lacy head. The hop aromas intensify when liberated in the glass. Sweet pine, grapefruit, lemon and pineapple.  What I find most amazing about this beer is its balance. Malty and sweet without being cloying. Hoppy without being too bitter or pungent. The alcohol is present on the palate, but harmonizes well with the other flavors. The mouthfeel is very pleasant. Perfect body without being syrupy, hot or too thin.  I love this beer with spicy Mexican or spicy Indian foods. It complements the spices perfectly.  If you are afraid of hoppy beers, you probably aren't going to like this one.

S - There is not a whole lot of aromatic potency, but what is there is nice, mostly a toasty dank hoppiness centered more in the earthy range than piney or citric.  T - The taste is very full of flavor, with alcohol prominently figuring into the equation. The malt body is fairly light, especially for the style, but then again 90 Minute is obviously quite a different DIPA. The hop contribution is a generally intangible green dankness that is bitter but very well-placed.  M - On the lighter side for the style, but it all good in the hood as far as I am concerned...

Had this from a bottle, poured into a pint glass. There is a surprising amount of carbonation for a double IPA, nice foamy head that subsided relatively quickly but it was present nonetheless. Right away the hops hit you, it opens up to some interesting citrus rind flavors and it's surprisingly wet for a beer of this alcohol content. Yet the bitterness just overwhelms everything. I'm still a n00b beer drinker but I can't help but feel like the bitterness of the hops just overwhelms the malt and any pine flavors, it just sort of ends up feeling really heavy. One thing I have to say though is that the alcohol is hidden quite well. I guess the hops just sort of cover up the high alcohol content and honestly, I was surprised that i put away nearly the whole bottle so fast, which just shows it's relatively easy to drink.

It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this brew has an excellent flavor and aroma to it. There is just something about it that I love. Glad that Dogfish Head is readily available in my area again as this is my new drinking beer when there is nothing else I want to have in the fridge. It is totally worth trying for those of you who have not.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,haazer,3.87,"Poured bottle into a Tulip Glass.  Bottled on 9/1/10  A- Combination of orange and gold. Ruby maybe? If you bring it close enough it looks as if staring through one. Pours an average amount of an offwhite head, settles down to a small thin layer. Good carbonation. No effervesence though. Leaves condensation in combinaion with tiny bit of lace down the glass  S- Good fruity aroma. Citrus, grapefruit, orange, pear, and hints of the alcohol, but not overbearing. A sweat candy apple aroma as the beer warms.  T- Pretty balanced for the amount of hops. Good citrus flavor, leafy. Definitely taste the barley combined with the hops. The alcohol comes in and warms at the end, but with that alcohol is the hop smack.  M- Slightly prickly. Little bubbly, can feel the carbonation. Light to medium body feel. Sort of feels like drinking a mixed drink with soda. The booze is warming.  D- A good DIPA. Very well balanced, my GF HATES hops, but she even said she could drink this one. Hops are detectable but not the overbearing prickly, piney feel you get from other DIPA's(which is what I prefer). Alcohol brings this down a tad, but still good.  Notes: I love hoppy beers, but lets be honest, theres no better way to enjoy them than fresh at the brewery, or somewhere on tap. The longer you let them sit the mellower they become. This has only been bottled slightly over a month ago, yet I feel this may have mellowed some. I doubt I'm building a tolerance to hops. Still a great choice for a DIPA, don't know if I'd buy a case though just because I'd feel rushed to enjoy the best of it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,FanofHefe,4.82,"My current favorite IIPA. Pours a beautifully clear dark orange/amber color with a very nice head which does dissipate quickly due to the relatively high gravity. Some slight lacing. The aroma is incredibly enticing - very sweet with a slight hint of hops and citrusy notes. The taste is a perfect blend of nice hop bitterness with a tasty malt backbone, achieving a near perfect blend of bitterness and sweet maltiness. The alcohol is a little present, but masked very well by the tasty blended components. A true winner in my book.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Used a snifter for this one, pours a nice golden orange brew with a medium white crown. Enticing hops, pine, barley aromas with no alcohol percieved. This brew its crazy balanced. On the palate the medley of hops, and barley its great. The hops greet you intensly at the beggining and the barley brings the brew to its great aftertaste. Very refreshing with great drinkability for a 9%abv brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,StaveHooks,4.09,A - Pours an amber copper with a 1 finger white head that dissipates quickly. Little to no lacing.  S - Nice caramel malt with some floral pine and alcohol coming through. It kind of reminds me of Hobby Lobby.  T - Sweet buttery caramel malt with a slight fruity character. The hops are assertive and have a kind of a candy bittering. Oily pine and citrus comes through to even out the heavy malt.  M - Full bodied with moderate carbonation.  This is the 4th time I've had this beer and the malt always surprises me. I always thought from looking at reviews that this would be all hop and little malt. This beer is quite balance with the malt presence almost having a slight edge over the hops presence. Although this time the beer seemed to be significantly less hoppy that the previous three. The first 2 ties the lacing was incredible. The last 2 weren't that great. The bottle says 8/20/10 so it makes it less less than 2 months old. I don't know. Seems a little different every time.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Both flavors complement each other very well. There is also a citrus aftertaste  M: medium bodied, not much carbonation  D: For being an Imperial IPA, it is really smooth and easy to drink. I think most good quality IPAs taste the same but this one separates itself and does not taste like all the rest. This is definitely my favorite IPA. If it were only a little cheaper I would have it all the time!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The smell is is quite strong and mostly of hops and citrus. The initial taste is surprisingly sweet and malty but it quickly morphs into the hops one expects from an IPA along with a hint of citrus. The aftertaste that is only slightly bitter. This beer isn't expecially thick, but the carbonation does give it an interesting mouthfeel. One of my favourite IPAs.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Very traditional of an IPA, but does not sting the nose. Seems malty, since the smell is a little softer.  Taste: Bitter at first, then a bitter-sweet flavor. Floral finish that lingers for a good 30 seconds after drinking. Aftertaste leaves the tongue feeling sweet.  Mouthfeel: Balanced carbonation, with a light-medium body. Coats the mouth with a flavor that is delicious and makes you want to have more.  Drinkability: Very enjoyable. Not very strong in flavor, so easily consumed. While drinking with my friends who don't care for IPAs, they enjoy it.

10099,2093,ElijahCSkuggs,2.9,"I plan on drinking every beer in the world that's related to the coolest animals in the world. So, Dogfish Head....you're up next.  Amber, apple juice color that's warm and appealing. The head is nice and foamy thick, sporting an off white hue. Slight retention, and just a solid good looking brew. Nicely carbonated as well.  Hoppy, clean, refreshing and fruity. This smells just swell.  What a strange and distinct difference between the aromas and tastes. Just too bitter for my liking. It has a very strong kick of hops and malt that makes me want to go chop wood. Makes me think of Pine Sol. The strength here gave me a headache last night when I first tried it, and it's giving me another headache now. Did I say the kick here is strong? This is a beer that either, I just don't enjoy...or a beer that I'm just not used to. I'll be wearisome of Double IPA's from this moment forth.  Again, the mouthfeel leaves that taste you either love, or you...don't love. You know where I stand. But putting the taste to the side, it leaves a welcoming glaze inside your mouth that you'll catch on your lips as well. That's an aspect I do enjoy having apart of my beer.  For me, the drinkability is obviously low. I'd rather have a Miller Lite than this. I'd rather smell this any day of the week, but drink....thanks but no thanks. Though, it is something I will return to when I believe myself to be a true Beer Advocate.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

It was their featured bottled premium craftbrew. I can say it was excellent and well worth the $6.50/12 oz. 90 minute IPA, some good seafood, and Monday Night football. Damn good night.  Update 12/2012: Since first trying this beer in 2010 I have had it many times. I have to say that if I see it on a a menu I order one even though I usually like to explore new things on the beer menu. It is never disappointing.

10099,2093,ChadQuest,3.62,"I like this one, and i figured out why. it's like a mini- american Barley Wine. It really is.  The aroma has the hoppy sweetness characteristic of a big american style BW, take a whiff of a few and then take a wiff of this. Besides a bit more citrus in the 90 min you get alot of similar notes, and alot of carmamelized nuts and fruits.  Taste has a strong caramel ground layer which the various hop notes are built upon. The citrus type hops stand out most when fresh with a lighter amount of syrupy pine varietals taking a 2nd seat. there is just enough tropical-esque fruits mixed in to note. The alcohol is there but not ruining the mix.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Smell: Hop oils, and citrus comes through very readily, but there is a bread like scent, and almost a caramel scent also.  Taste: Certainly an amazing taste, the hops come at you in a rush of bitterness, and suddenly the malts step in, and clean the palate, it is nearly a roller-coaster of flavor. The hops come back at the end for a nice finish.  Mouthfeel: Absolutely great, because the carbonation in this beer is spot on to me, and leaves a very nice feeling in the mouth.

Raising the glass of 90 to my nose, inhaling tones of grapefruit and caramel, taking my first long draw, I feel like Bartholomew Roberts on his best day.  If you enjoy IPAs, this is a must-try. Continually hopped for 90 minutes, 9.0% alcohol, 90 IBUs...enough said. Perfect balance of malt and hops which produces a strong brew that goes down smooth. Not for chugging, this beer is meant to savor each sip. Goes great with a sharp cheese (Stilton, Provolone, aged Cheddar) and some bread/crackers.

Beautiful bubbles are all over in this beer and maintaining the head. Absolutely gorgeous looking beer. S: Delicious scent of citric hops and caramel. Very sweet on the nose but you can tell this one has some bitterness to it. T: Amazing malty caramel flavor with enough bitterness to keep it all in check with some earthy citrus flavors and a bitter granny apple skin flavor after the swallow. There's a reason I brought eight of these back with me. M: Full bodied with good carbonation and some stickyness from all the malt. D: Although it isn't wise or doctor recommended I'd drink this stuff in place of water  Overall: A very well balanced and tasty Double IPA that I probably should have bought more of in place of some other beers(Magic Hat Hex).

The hops come out more bitter than flavorful. Malt flavors are toffee and caramelish. Resinous hop finish.  MF- Carbonation nice and sublte.

A good amount of sweet citrus and malts.  Feel is roughly medium, with a little carbonation zing. A tad slick and sticky.  Fairly good drinkability.

Pine, herbs, citrus (primarily grapefruit), and even a little sweet malt in the background. Great layers.  Sweet nectar - what a great flavor profile! Beautiful hoppiness that's full and vibrant yet not overwhelming. There's a little juicy-fruit-gum flavor there (bright fruits, essentially) that sit on top of a nice malt backbone and everything blends so well. A little bitter on the finish, but not a problem at all.  Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp simultaneously.  Drinkability for a 9%ABV brew is outstanding.

10099,2093,gopens44,4.1,"A - Nice coppery color with a quickly dissipating light cream colored head that recedes to an island of bubbles and a thin cover.  S - Citrus tones hold hands with the hop/malt wave that comes out right away. Maybe I had this too cold, but it didn't release full aromas for a few minutes.  T - Real nice. Once again, there is a citrus taste along with the hop presence and maybe some sort of spicing which I can't quite lay my finger on. For a high ABV beer, there is not any sort of overwhelming alcohol taste at all. Couldn't even detect it. I tend to gravitate towards more crisp IPA's, but this one is truly an exception. Then again, it's a different animal than a typical IPA, being a double and all...  M - Thick, smooth and a touch dry on the finish. Not heavily carbonated. No discernible aftertaste either.  D - I could probably have one of these an evening, kinda like the same way I treat an RIS. Doubt that you'd want to down 3 or 4 of these in one sitting though.

Apricot seems to be present, along with what seems like berries (strawberries, raspberries)  T- Very Sweet. the hops are wonderful, far better than the 60 min. The fruity flavour comes out with the hops and blends with them very nicely. There is also a hint of some citrus flavours. The beer has a very smooth mouth feel as well and sits in the mouth nice and somewhat creamy texture. There is very little bitterness to be had as well in the after taste, also an improvement over the 60 min.  D- Definitely one of the best ipa's out there.

The lace that is left, is a huge swathing blobs of resiny lace.  S: Underling malt characters are swept by a floral hop aroma. Earthy and citrus hops are present. Full bodied aroma is sure to make this a full bodied brew. As brew warms, the notes of the alcohol are more present.  T/M: The explosive of hops is a nice blend of citrus and herbs, a great layering of these and some other earthy note. The mouthfeel is sticky and full in body. Long finish, with prolonged hop notes, but the real lingering taste is that of a strong malt backbone. As the brew warms up, the hop character sits back and the malts take over, with burnt autumn leave coming on the front.   D: This is a very good strong ABV beer that hides it very well in the layers of flavors. A IPA that really sets the standards high for many developed flavors. Taking the best parts of the style and making all of them extremely great. The body while thick, is easy to drink from the amount of smooth hops used.

Taste is great - some citrus hops at first followed by a spicy bitter taste. Just enough sweetness from the malt to offset bitter hops. Alcohol is well hidden. Mouthfeel is heavy with light to medium carbonation. Drinkability is good for the style - no one element is so overpowering that I get tired of it.

Pours out a dark blonde, allmost an amber color. Decent head of about a half inch.  Mouthfeel is pretty thick and syrupy. Immediately, a decent hop bitterness appears, although I don't believe it's quite as high as many other DIPA's. There's a distinct sweet, candied malt undercurrent that is present throughout the swallow as well, though. It's a bit biscuity, and while it obviously comes in 2nd to the hops here, it's noticeable and provides a balance. At the the finish, the sweet, heavy malt and the hops provide a very good simultaneous balance between sweet and bitter...I think it's done quite well. In the end, the alcohol does show itself, albeit not to the point of detracting from it. Not much bitterness lingering at all...very clean.  So what can I say? I think this one is done very, very well. I'm actually impressed.

The nose has beautiful floral notes with strong malty sweetness with hints of caramel, citrus and a little hoppy acidity.  The flavor is a beautiful blend of caramel, malt and high alpha hops. Definitely some Cascade and Chinook hops. While well malted and hoped there is still a bit of heat that seeps through.

The grassiness of the hops is blunt, but in a good way. Mild fruity sweetness at the end of it all.  T - The bitterness from the intense amount of hops is balanced out perfectly by the smooth malty backbone. Per usual for a DFH brew, the 9% ABV is almost completely hidden.  M - Not too thick, but not too thin. Absolutely perfect for this style of beer, and very refreshing on the palate.  D - Very easy to drink; even with the high alcohol content this is a very sessionable drink.  Notes - DFH's flagship brew, and for good reason.

Smell has a noticeable hop quality, though it is balanced with the sweetness of the barley.  Mouthfeel is somewhat carbonated, but as you drink, it becomes smooth and enjoyable.  Taste is where this beer hits its biggest mark. Hops are up front, with a big noticeable sharpness, but through the finish comes the malty sweetness of the two-row barley.

10099,2093,BBP,4.38,"A- Clear copper with quite spirited carbonation. Maintained a good head for the duration of the drink and left gorgeous lacing.  S- Pine and caramel are dominant.  T- Grapefruit notes from hops at first. Strangely the aftertaste is all pine. As it warms up, there's a very smoky flavor. There's a lot of caramel that doesn't make the drink, but it seems to exist in most of the flavor in a secondary way. While it's not sweet, there's some apple flavor in it as well.  The hops are a big part of the drink, but they seem to be a foundation for the other flavors, IMO. It's bittersweet at first, and then it works it's way into a smoky flavor. It's almost as if there's cocoa in this from the dry bitterness, and perhaps some coffee.  I've had this with some age and it was pretty sweet, but having it fresh seems to add a ton of bitterness which really supports the flavors better.  M- Full body with perfect carbonation. A little bit dry and syrupy (while somehow creamy too) and coats your whole mouth and even your lips a bit with it.  D- Easy to down, and one of the most complex beers I know of. Describing it is a bitch for me, and I feel like I've only scratched the surface. For a Double IPA, it's got a ton of hop bitterness, but has even more malt character. It has great balance, and is something I appreciate more, the more I understand beer, and recognize the flavors.  It's an easy drinker, but at the same time I like savoring it. The 9% is pretty far away, but still is there. Masked pretty well though. I would recommend this drink to anybody.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Flightoficarus,4.72,"Finally getting around to reviewing this one, here we go!  Serving type - Bottle poured into snifter.  A - Pours a beautiful amber with a nice, creamy single finger off-white head, which persists for a minute or so, then recedes to creamy lacing around the glass.  S - Smell is of caramelized, piney hops, bready malts, candied orange peels, and some mild alcohol presence (no surprise at 9%)  T - Just fantastic..Rich, bready malts, orange, and caramel, with some stout-like roasted coffee/chocolate notes mixed in. Spicy, slightly piney hop finish. Not too bitter, actually quite well balanced. Amazing.  M - Body is on the medium to heavier side of medium, with moderate carbonation, and a slick, creamy mouthfeel. Slightly oily like most DIPA's, but far from cloying. Excellent.  D - Obviously, 9% and fuller body prevent this from being a session beer, but nonetheless is very enjoyable.  Overall - Definitely one of the best DIPA's out there. This one stands out from the crowd with it's mix of traditional DIPA flavors, and darker beer flavors. I will say though, if you're looking for nothing but hop bitterness, look elsewhere. This is a complex, balanced ale!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,drtampa33615,4.5,"Dogfish 90 is a wonderful recipe and is prepared by master craftsman - it is one of the best imperial IPA beers readily available in It's usually one of the most expensive Imperial IPAs on the shelf.

Again, good recipe.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,woosterbill,3.61,"12oz bottle, bottled 7/1/10, into a Duvel tulip.  A: A high, straight pour results in two fingers of sticky, creamy, dense tan foam atop a clear orange-amber body. The head shows fantastic retention and leaves a decent amount of lace. Very nice indeed.  S: Fairly bold aromas of piney hops, caramel malt, and just a bit of spice. Definitely not as hoppy as I'd like from a DIPA, but it's an enjoyable smell nonetheless. Rather barleywinish.  T: Much like the nose, there's a balancing act between sweet candied malts and bitter, piney hops. The hops do a nice job on the finish, but the malts are clearly the overall winner. Tasty, but not all that great for the style, really.  M: Smooth medium body with a solid amount of rather sharp carbonation. Both hefty and lively.  D: Big sweetness + big bitterness isn't exactly a recipe for drinkability, but at least the substantial ABV is kept pretty much completely in check. Not too bad.  Notes: I enjoy this, but it isn't what I remember 90 Minute being (hop-wise) the last time I had a bottle many moons ago. Of course, I was less of a hophead then, so maybe it's the same and I've just undergone LTS. Whatever the case, this tastes as much like a hoppy American Barleywine as it does a DIPA. It's less hoppy than Squall and less complex than Burton Baton, and therefore a bit of a disappointment for me. I'll always have a fondness for it as one of my gateway beers into the wonderful world of craft, but it really doesn't impress me anymore.  Cheers!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Baraka,4.92,"Pours copper with a solid head that leaves a bit of lacing on the glass. Nose is pine/citrus hops mixed with a caramel maltiness. Like the nose suggests, this is a very complex IIPA, containing both an assault of hop bitterness and a strong balancing malt backbone.

Flavor continues the aroma and is very well balanced, includes some maple and dark fruit flavors. The hop bitterness is assertive, but not over powering, very nice.

I looked for a freshness date and for the life of me I couldn't find one. Of course, I find it when I get home and the date is 10/24/06. I am fully prepared for 90 Minute Barleywine.  Pours a golden copper color with a little head forming on top. There is some lacing which is pleasant given the date.  The smell is sweet caramel bready malts. There are no hops in sight which is rather interesting but not at all surprising given the date. A little heat creeps in at the end.  All kinds of dark biscuit malts up front in the taste which transitions to an alcohol bite. The aftertaste is very clean with absolutely no bitterness.  The mouthfeel is full, smooth, and satisfying. There is a little missing on the back end, but it is decent.  Given the fact that this is a 4 year old IPA, it is what I expected. Barleywine-esque and nothing bitter.

T: Like the nose you get a a nice hop flavor as well as the grapefruit. This gives way to a great caramel taste from the malts and finishes sweet.  M/D: Medium bodied with nice carbonation.

Taste- Big, heavy hitting hop flavors throughout, although they are balanced very nicely by the malt. Actually a decent amount of sweetness in this beer. There is just a flash of alcohol flavor mixed in there, which folds in nicely to the overall flavor profile.  Mouthfeel- A very smooth beer, full bodied but not quite as sticky as some.  Drinkability- About 98% of the general population would at the very least make a face after trying this beer, however there are those of us who cannot get enough of stuff like this.

So obviously so well made.  You can feel the potency as you bring the beer to your lips. And then everything goes pearshaped. When the beer makes contact with your tongue you are hit with a sickly cloying sappy body which just smothers all of the beer's positive qualities. I am sure there are ale conners around the world wagging their fingers in indignation. This just so obviously lacks balance and is too much of an attention seeker for me.

Maybe a slight bit of pine and maybe some floral hops but its not easy to pick them out. Not a great smell overall.  I initially taste sweetness from the malt- think mostly caramel/toffee. Then, very little pine, and maybe some sort of grassy/herbal phenol. Plenty of fusel alcohol as well. It's a little harsh and solvent like. I know this beer is 9% but, the alcohol doesn't seem very well integrated.  Medium carbonation, medium mouthfeel. Feels kind of sticky and syrupy.  I wanted this to be in the regular rotation for me but, I am not a big fan of this one. There is just not enough bitterness and way too much caramel for me.

Head was one finger and left some nice lacing down the glass. Color was typical of any other American IPA. Nose was nice, but not overpowering. Taste was similar to 60 Min, but a bit more of everything. For some reason, I find an earthiness to DFH IPAs--- this follows suit.

10099,2093,scottchesterhall,2.77,"On the pour this looked like a great IPA--nice and coppery--promising strong malt presence with the hops to boot. Little head. Less carbonation.  But--as much praise as I've heard of this beer--I was skeptical at first sniff. There was almost nothing there! ""Maybe all their hops are in the bittering and finishing phase,"" I thought. The smell was my first foreshadowing that I might be disappointed.  I regret to say it, but the taste was just bland. Let me be more specific...too balanced. For an IPA/Imperial I'm ready to have my socks knocked off. I'm ready for a Pliny, a Maharaja, or an Alpine Nelson...and I'm getting more of an Arrogant Bastard...and that's being generous. Granted at 9% the malt is big, but where are the hops???  Mouthfeel was fine...little carbonation. The other reviewers are right: syrupy.  Drinkability was this beer's highest praise as it doesn't drink like a 9% beer. Maybe that's it's best quality. You can drink this thinking you're drinking an amber ale--like maybe a Rogue American Amber--but when I'm gearing up for an Imperial IPA? Who cares that I'm drinking 9% that feels like 5%...I want to have a flavor profile that leaves me something to remember. Dogfish 90 minute left me with nothing but grave disappointment.  I swear all these positive reviewers are either:  a. Partial to the Dogfish head name, and therefore not objective and suspect. b. Ten years behind the evolution of Imperial IPA's and have never had a Pliny the Elder.  This beer makes me want to never drink anything brewed east of the Mississippi.

10099,2093,Jeffo,3.03,"Got this at Binny's Downtown in Chicago on our recent baseball trip.  From a bottle into a snifter  Note: Drank all three in order.  APPEARANCE: Pours a one finger, medium looking white head that crackles enough for me to notice. Decent retention on the head. Clear SAE amber orange in color with zero carbonation evident. Head slowly fades to a thin wisp and a ring that remain until the end and leave a few dots of lace down the glass. Exactly the same as their 60min IPA.  SMELL: Pale malts, sweet pineapple and citrus notes, as well as some floral hop aromas. Medium strength and plenty inviting, though it's exactly the same as their 60min IPA, which is a little weak for a DIPA.  TASTE: Starts out the same as their 60min IPA, with pale malts, pineapple and notes of citrus in the beginning. Proceeds to some spiciness and boozy qualities in the middle, which are a little stronger and bolder than its little brother. A bold sweet melon and hop bitter aftertaste has lots of spicy vodka flavored booze in there. Simply a slightly stronger, and essentially boozier version of their 60min.  PALATE: Medium body and medium carbonation. Lacks some needed creaminess, like its little brother, goes down smooth with a little burn after the swallow and finishes slightly mouth-coating. Decent.  OVERALL: This one is basically a boozier version of 60min, but the booze isn't accompanied by more malt or hop flavor. A little too boozy for the style in my book, but it is still tasty enough to bother finishing, even if it is a one and done. While I'd grab their 6% IPA again, there are better 9% DIPAs out there.

S: Pine, fruit, spice, grass, floral and woody notes. The hops smell like Centennial to me... The woody notes pleasantly surprised me. The smell had something a little funky- not really like chemical- but more like syrup... probably because of the high ABV.  T: This is a yummy beer... I taste all of the things mentioned in the smell, with an addition of some big round caramel malts. The taste is not as bitter as expected. Beer kind of reminds me of a barleywine...  M: Thick and syrupy. Coats your entire mouth with its sweetness. The hops sit at the back of your throat.

10099,2093,Snamnoum,4.75,"Poured from the bottle into a dogfish head signature glass  Appearance - golden honey color. Produced one finger of rich and silky off white head which left big sticky clumps of lace. Very good looking.  Smell - Floral piny hops, toasted malt, yeast, some citrusy grapefruit.  Taste - The taste of the beer is massive. It begins with the hops which come in a bright punch but are immediately toned done by tons of unfermented sugars and sweet malt. Yeast has a small presence but one that is felt. Bitter hop finish and just a touch of alcohol rounds out the beer. I just love its complexity.  Mouthfeel - fantastically syrupy from the sugar and oily from the hops and the same time. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.  Drinkability - This is a beer that I come back to again and again.

10099,2093,ToasterChef,4.32,"Reviewed from my notes; served at the Great Lost Bear. The beer came to me in a tulip glass with almost no head, which seems odd to me. All that is present is a tan skim of foam, but that is all that there is room for--the liquid is filled right to the top of the glass. It is golden orange in color.  The beer has a good, crisp hop aroma. It is forest-like, with pine, damp moss and some bitter scents.  When I taste the beer, the hops kick in immediately. They are bitter, oily, crunchy hops. Graham cracker, maple and brown sugar make up the sweet malt tastes. The hops and sugar linger on for a long time...longer than I can wait to take another sip!  This is a full-bodied beer. It has some tickling carbonation. There is a slick oil coat that is a tad sticky. It coats everything: lips, teeth, tongue and roof. This mouthfeel does shy away from the 90 Minute's imperial status.  Sure this is a strong beer, but it is quite drinkable. I keep wanting another sip.

10099,2093,StephenRich,4.47,"Do you remember the Dogfish Head 60 minute IPA? All that robust and citrus hop character and the immensely crisp and refreshing bite? Well, the 60 minute was actually not the first continually hopped IPA that Dogfish Head made - before the 60 came the 90 Minute IPA; an Imperial IPA which was first brewed at the Dogfish Head Brewpub, and is now the Best Selling Imperial IPA in North America, and potentially the world.  The 90 Minute IPA utilizes continual hopping during a ninety minute boil to create a pungent hop aroma and flavor, rather than an overbearing one. Beyond that it is also dry hopped during conditioning to increase its lively fresh hop character.  Just like the 60 Minute, the 90 is not for everyone. People who claim to not enjoy the bitter bite of hoppy beers would not be impressed by the 90, or the 60 for that matter. But if you are a hop-head, or can appreciate the savory bitter and fresh characteristics of rich hops than this Imperial India Pale Ale is a magnificent treat!  The 90 comes in 341ml bottles which you can often find in four packs all across the United States. They have not yet found their way into Canada unfortunately. It is 9.0%abv, and also is rated at 90 IBU (International Bitter Units). I am lucky enough to have a Dogfish Head Chalice, so I pulled the 90 out of the fridge to warm a touch, prepared the chalice, and also a nice comfortable spot on my couch to enjoy this in.  The 90 Minute IPA pours smoothly with a mild viscosity to it. It slowly builds in the bottom of the glass with little vigor, but soon as the bottle in half way through carbonation is now erupting from the bottom and a large and fluffy almost two inch head is developed brilliantly above the beer. The head is creamy white and filled with airy bubbles perfectly resting just below the edge of the glass.  The beer itself is transparent and rich - its glows a copper orange with a lot of red, mahogany and caramel. The contrast between the beer and its foam is magnicifent - it already shows body and rich soul. The nose is round and balanced with warm and rich pale malts, smooth hops bitterness, and light sweet caramel. The malt here is most prominent, which is surprising when you contemplate the 60 Minute IPA. Hops here just linger around showing a touch of citrus, pine and earth. It is also warmer in alcohol; the caramel from the malt brings with it a slight whiff of 9%.  Just as Sam Calagione (Dogfish Head founder) describes, the 90 minute continual hopping is used so to add hop flavor, not hop brutality. And here is shows its power in spades. Let the 90 pour over your palate, don't sip it right away, really get a nice mouthful. The sweetness from pale malts show themselves on your tongue, but then a smooth layer of hops show themselves in grapefruit, lemon peal, earthy pine, grass, spice and fresh herbs.  The balance is really impeccable; smooth and soft caramel flows across your cheeks and the roof of your mouth, all while a deep resin of hops float throughout your mouth. As the beer warms, more sweetness shows itself and the fresh bitter becomes more brash and citrus. It begins to touch raisins and fruitcake almost bringing more complexity to the picture. The finish is soft and full, with only slight quenching characteristics.  The beer is less carbonated, less aggressive, and less crisp than the 60 minute IPA. And many people do criticize it for that. However it is more balanced, and better constructed, with more depth of flavor and rounded sensations. Its an interesting wold this - most people who look for an Imperial IPA are hop heads and want to be crushed by the one sided insanity of a 60 Minute IPA, so the 90 is too balanced for them and not quite insane enough.  The 90 to me is a sublime IPA with amazing character and genuine flavors which compliment the brewers and their efforts. It has an elegant mouthfeel, perfectly smooth malt flavors with complex hops dancing with it. The 90 seems to be living in a more sivilized world than the 60 Minute IPA.  It will also age well over time with the added strength and sweetness, and pairs magnificently well with beef, potatoes, cheesy breads, olive oil based pastas, rich cheeses, and rich cheesecake.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Unlike numerous versions of DIPAs, the hops do not totally dominate the show. This is true to the East Coast style which I prefer. The hop flavor makes itself known and brings a slight bite to the brew, but the sweet, fruity flavors are equally if not more powerful. Even though this beer is 9% ABV, the alcohol isn't noticeable at all; dangerous because I could drink a 12 pack of this (well I could at least try til I pass out).  Minimal carbonation and an amazing consistency. The mouthfeel is the balanced and full; smooth, malty, hoppy, wowzers I'm in love.  For a beer of such strength and complexity, it's incredibly easy to drink. A big, bold Imperial IPA that's as drinkable as any beer on the planet. If you like great beer, get your hands on this often overlooked gem.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Bbloom1989,4.51,"As someone who does not see this beer very often, getting my hands on this beer made me more than excited.  The pour on this beer shows the gold bronze color to this beer. Crystal clear and beautiful, this beer is really a work of art to look at. I wish I could have this much more often. The head is similar to 60 min, in that it is not too thick, but lingers through out the entire session. Even after letting it sit out for a bit, the lacing and some foam continue to persist.  Smelling this beer reveals piney, citrus, herbal and grapefruit. I'm sure I'm missing some part of this beer's nose, but I can hardly wait to taste it.  Hop overload is an understatement. One of the most hop solid beer I have ever had, and I know that I am drinking truly one of the best DIPA's in the country. I will leave telling you that if you have the chance have a glass or two and you will realize that DIPA's are one of the only good things in this world.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,kbutler1,4,"Bottle. Bottled on 6/18/10. Poured a gold orange clear color with a 1 finger head of tiny bubbles. Fairly strong piney aroma with some citrus characteristics, but mostly the pine. The first sip is a barage of bitterness with a nice balance of sweet malts. Finishes crisply with a lingering bitterness. Not too bitter in that it really kills your pallet but for sure more probably bitter than most people would like. Actually prefer this one over the 60 minute version. Medium mouthfeel.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,cbutova,4.2,"Bottled 06/25/10.  A- Clear amber-red body with a one finger off-white head. Head has good retention and leaves a coat of fine, spotty lace.  S- Hops and sweet sugar, reminiscent of a west coast IIPA or Barleywine. Definite peach notes, earthy hops, caramel malt. Decent aroma strength.  T- Not quite as hoppy as the nose, more hop bitterness than flavor. The hops do, however, lend earthy and piney notes, just a bit of fruit and citrus. Booze comes through along with a good deal of sweetness. The malt is very heavy and unique, I have always liked the caramel, slightly roasty malt profile of this beer. It adds a new dimension to the style.  MF- Moderate body with high carbonation stinging the palate. The body is creamy and very warm. Lots of bitterness on the tongue.  DB- Strange how much a beer changes in my view in about a year. The thing I remember, and best part, is the malt profile here. It is just a bit roasty, toasty biscuit and caramel. Stronger and boozier than I remember, very aggressive. A Double IPA of a different brand, huge malt, alcohol and bitterness, the malt really makes this one what it is. This one draws a fine line between IIPA and Barleywine, try it if your one of the very few BAs that hasn't.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,MrHassellYaHurd,4.46,"Pours an immaculately clear copper color with a thin white head. Visible carbonation is average; not super assertive nor lax.  The smell is sweet and malty without a trace of the biting alcoholic aroma I was expecting. Herbal-smelling hops, reminiscent of a British IPA.  The taste is very sweet, with quite a bit of sweetness coming from the significant 9% ABV. Hops bitterness, while pronounced, is not overpowering. The slightly roasted and sweet grain is exquisitely complex and perhaps a little atypical of what I would personally think of as an American IPA.  Thick-bodied and viscous, drinkability is excellent.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,feelmefoam,4.28,"Pours a pretty, murky caramel color with lots of lively carbonation snowing upwards and culminating in an inch of thick, fluffy, cream-colored head that has very nice retention and shows some decent lacing.  DFH 90 smells sort of like a barleywine. Lots of sweet caramel and toffee malts come through in the nose, bolstered by a sweet and slightly spicy hop aroma that comes in after the initial malt rush. Pretty fragrant, too, you don't really have to search for the smell.  This is a damn good beer, but a very malt-forward IPA. Once again, the sweet, thick caramel malts show up first and foremost, providing a solid backbone upon which some sweet, candied citrus and spicy hop flavor build upon. Bitterness is nearly non-existent. A slight bit of alcohol comes through towards the end of each sip, giving a slightly dry feel to the finish.  The mouthfeel is thick and juicy, which goes nicely with the malty background of the beer. Medium bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation and a little nip of alcohol.  Overall, this is a very good beer. I love the fact that it's different from 60 minute IPA in that it's much maltier and a bit thicker. Different strokes for different folks, but I like 'em both. Another very drinkable beer from DFH, even at 9% alcohol. Now all that's left is to try the 120 minute.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,ThePorterSorter,3.95,"I had this beer knowing that dogfish knows how to do an extraordinary IPA. I have few complaints about the beer, it poured such a beautiful amber-brown and was so perfectly hoppy I shed a tear for beerkind...but told everybody else it was only my allergies...  The first thing you come into with this beer is just what ""90 minutes of constant hop addition"" can do to a well crafted malt. It was truly a tasty reminder to why I enjoy IPAs so much. Of course this dogfish head has an ABV well above normal, but i'm not complaining. Although 9% does push the limits of personal drinkability, it was surprisingly gulp-able.  I certainly enjoyed this beer and wouldn't hesitate in purchasing it again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,kwjd,4.28,"Pours an amber-orange colour with huge white head. Good head retention as the head settles down a bit and lacing surrounding the glass. Not sure how the appearance could be improved. Smells of piney hops and lots of caramel sweetness. Tastes like a very well balanced double IPA. Sometimes I'm in the mood for a hop bomb, in which case this wouldn't be the right beer, but for a balanced double IPA with lots of malt, not sure this can be beat.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S- Nice aroma of citrus hop to it. Pretty subtle. Smells like it's going to have a good bite to it.  T- Starts out with nice citrus, pine hop taste. Malts balance out quickly to make for a very smooth drink. The balance is perfect as the beer ends with no emphasis on hops or malts, just great balance.  M- Medium to full body. Moderate carbonation. Some bitterness to it.  D- Very good beer! Good hop flavors to it. The alcohol is masked very well. Does start to come out a bit as it warms, but still nice. Felt like I could drink a few, but did creep up on me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,boomer31,3.9,I really enjoy this beer. I've had it a few times but finally getting around to reviewing it.  A - Pours a clear-gold color with a plain white quarter inch head that sticks to the glass. Really nice  S - The citrisy and fruity hops come out first then the malt hits you in the face. This smells balanced...the hops don't overwhelm the malty goodness.  T - First the piney hops and alcohol hit you then the malt and more alcohol. Maybe this has been sitting around for a while because I remember more hops from previous tasting. Nonetheless the alcohol really stands out here and adds a nice peppery finish.  M - Full and highly carbonated but very rich for an IPA. Nice  D - Again the alcohol really stands out...much more so than before. I do like this beer but where did the hops go?  DFH always seems to draw either a lot of praise or a lot of disdain. I happen to enjoy most of what they put out and this is no exception.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,BranfordBound,4.18,"Pours a nice clear copper with a long lasting two finger white head. Decent carbonation with great lacing.  Smells of hops, floral and citrus. Some sweetness in there as well, slight raisin.  Tastes like an IPA, this one's got a big, sweet malt note. Some dark fruits in the malt, but not too strong, caramel and bread in the malt as well. Hops come out at the end and unleash their flavor and grapefruit. Not overly bitter. I'd say almost a 50/50 mix of strong malt and hops.  A little thick, pretty wet. Alcohol is noticeable sometimes.  If this wasn't 9%, it would be pretty darn drinkable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,hastings,3.87,I had the Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA at the Brewpub as well as the Brewery and it was a well made beer. It had the taste of what most IPAs wish they had.

10099,2093,FreshHawk,4.25,"A - Copper/light amber color with a large foamy and fluffy white head. Good retention with a decent layer of lace that sticks behind.  S - Good amount of different hoppy aromas come out with citrus/orange aroma, tropical fruit (mango, some pineapple, grapefruit, and others). Some floral and pine also present. Good backbone of caramel and other sweet malt aroma.  T - Similar to the nose. A lot of the hop flavors are sweeter fruit flavors along with touches of floral and pine flavors. Along with the sweeter caramel malt, this is a bit of a sweeter IPA. Not a lot of caramel flavor, but some, and definitely a malt presence in this one. There is a nice spiced and bitterness underneath this and some more earthy flavors as well.  M - Fuller side of medium body with a good amount of carbonation. Pretty smooth.  D - Pretty easy to drink with lots of fruity hop flavors. Definitely has a sweeter side, but there is enough bitterness and other flavors that it isn't cloying. Alcohol is pretty well hidden.  Notes: Overall this is a pretty good beer. Lots of fruity hop flavors and it comes off a little on the sweet side for the style(somewhat barleywine like), but it isn't cloying. Nice, easy to drink beer that is a good quality and easy to find beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

For a double IPA this is extremely well balanced an excellent the malt/hop mix was perfectly done here despite the very strong hop presence .

10099,2093,Nesued,4.03,"DIPAs, not the class I drink/review willingly. I'll admit my bias upfront.  Appearance - Apricot color with a slight haze. The carbonation is mild, feeding an ample tan two-finger frothy head. Noticable lacing forms on my pint glass as the head resolves, leaving a nice community of foam. As it warms, the lacing continues and the residual ring continues to remain. Nicely done.  Smell - Sweet caramel malty aroma coupled with a somewhat muted hop presence. Muted when you compare this to the big grapefruit/citrus nose that you find in a Hopslam, Pliny or Boy King. Very inviting and balanced for a DIPA.  Taste - The opening is a bite to the tongue, as expected, but it's a ""one-two-punch"" with a caramel malt presence to make this more than a one-trick pony. The middle has great bittering notes that proceed to the finish, with the alcohol keeping your mind on your manners as you drink this. The finish is dry and crisp, but with a sweet residual.  Mouthfeel - Medium mouthfeel. The carbonation remains throughout the life of the beer, aiding in the transport. Warming as you progress.  Drinkability - Look what this is classed with: Pliny, Hopslam, Dreadnaught, Boy King, Racer X. How do you compete with these? You bring more than just a ""tougue-ripping"" to the game. DFH 90 minute does that, very well. A nice sipper to go along with the other sippers in the DFH stable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Pours a clear amber, with a generous 3 finger off white and thick, mega-creamy head. Huge lacing too. Big aroma, getting grapefruit, some peach/pineapple, orange, a touch of pine and some other citrus all sitting upon a nice malt base. A little bit of alcohol comes through in the nose also. Malt and alcohol hit me first when it touched my lips, and then smoothed into a citrus fiesta across my tongue. Mouthfeel is smooth and oily with a drying finish, with medium carbonation, and its got some pretty good drinkability given the ABV, although the alcohol is not hidden. Bottle is just under two months old, so it scores a little lower than it probably would've fresh; I'll re-review when I have it fresher. Still a definite palate wrecker, and the bitterness is clearly presented.  EDIT: Received another bottle from 67couple via another trade. Bottled on date is even older, May 4, 2010.

The beer is a deep orange amber with wispy, irregular, rocky foam that leaves fantastic sticky lacy cling. The beer smells citrusy with a very distinct apricot and peach sweetness and slight bit caramel malt. The taste is bitter with a lot of complex hop flavor, mostly floral and fruity.

It's also floral with a bit of pine to it as well. Very nice multitude of hop flavors to it. It has a decent and relatively bold malt base to it as well.  The taste is not surprisingly hoppy. It has the tropical citrus hop flavor to it with some pineapple and grapefruit to it. It finishes on the bitter side with some more grapefruit and a little pine coming through. The malt flavor also comes through and lends a moderate sweetness with a bit of caramel.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is moderate. Pretty good mouthfeel for the style.

Poured into a glass, tried another sip and down the drain it went. The taste is not something I enjoyed in the least.

Flavor starts with heavy duty citrus and resinous hops, golden raisins, and some serious sweet caramel malt for a DIPA, moderate bitterness that is held back by the big malt presence. Alcohol is noticeable on the finish.  Mouthfeel is full and creamy, gets sticky, low to medium carbonation.

The aroma seems malt heavy but there are bright hop tones present and just a hint of alcohol.  Perhaps after just three and a half months in the bottle the hops have faded a bit but this double IPA seems a bit more malt heavy than I remember, however it was probably one of the first dozen or so craft beers I tried so perhaps it's my perceptions that have changed. Big full caramel drenched malts meet the tongue first and foremost but candied grapefruit and pine resin aren't too far behind (odd I remembered it the other way around). Alcohol backs up the flavors nicely and as the beer warms the hop flavors seem to step forward a bit while the finish remains pleasantly bitter.  The mouthfeel is full but not heavy, very slick and somewhat creamy while the carbonation creates a bit of bite on the tongue.  While my memories of this beer differ from my current reality this is good beer and I do recomend it.

10099,2093,SilverFoxxy,3.75,"First ever review so still getting my bearings. Drank on 11 Aug 10, bottled on 11 Dec 09.  Look: Careful pour into small tulip reveals a light brown/orange beer and a finger of white head which reduces to a collar. Aggressive looking carbonation.  Smell: Begins with a citrusy hop smell but as the head recedes as does this smell with sweet malts and brown sugar taking over. It smells sweet more than anything else. The scent finishes with a little bit of alcohol, reminding of the 9% abv.  Taste: Bit odd and uncharacteristic of the style even taking into account the 8 months on the bottle (not uncommon for US beer in the UK). Malt forward with the hops providing only a bitter finish tinged with some alcohol heat. As the bottle warmed it all came together a bit and felt much more integrated so I've been kind. Next time I would drink at room temperature.  Mouthfeel: Pretty good. A pleasant thickness but the high carbonation prevents it from feeling gloopy. Alcohol makes itself known with a warming around the gums after a few quick sips.  Drinkability: The fact that it's not a hop bomb aids drinkability but the booziness drops it back down one notch. After two I would stop; probably for the best.  Overall I enjoyed it even though I would prefer something a bit lighter and hoppier. Will get it again but try and get one a bit fresher.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The alcohol is very well masked in this beer, your main concern would be if you are a big fan of hops. If you are, then this beer delivers, in a nice package. Not ridiculously strong, but strong enough to remember. This beer would go great with a good sandwich too.  M- thick enough to have some density to it, watery enough to where it doesn't feel like you're eating the drink. Good balance of head and smoothness.  D- surprisingly drinkable.

M- Decent body, carbonation leaves just a little to be desired.  D- Good for a 9% abv DIPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Ripe fruity esters and some sweet malt in the back.  T&M: Tasty hops and a very smooth, thick malty body. Nice cake like maltiness in the middle with a ripe fruit and alcoholic kick in the end, finishes a little sweet with lingering bitter hop tones.

10099,2093,JToad,4.28,"Finally got around to reviewing this, as it is one of my favorite beers.  Served into a Dogfish Head goblet directly from the tap. Minimal head,with light off white lacing.Dark amber in color.  Smells of grapefruit and pine, with dark candied fruit mixed in as well.  Sweet and syrupy, with a bit of a dry finish. Tastes like candied fruit and raisisn, with a nice hop bitterness.  Very well balanced, with a bit of an attitude. As it warms the syrup really starts to show through. Alcohol is well masked.

I'm not blown away with the hops like others. The alcohol shines through, and leaves it harsh on the back end. At lower ABV the flavor might be nice, though not terribly complex, but it's all I can take to just get through one of these guys. Didn't live up to the billing.  M- Nice and smooth.

S: Some full citrus and piney hops and some earthy tones too. Warm malt and alcohol on the end.  T: Citrus and heavy pine. Sweet caramel malt and warming alcohol on the end. Too sweet for me though.  M: Fairly viscous but not really heavy. Has so syrupy qualities with an almost dry finish.  D: Not my favorite Imp. IPA. Many people love this beer but I just never got on board with it. It is good and I can have a few but I rather not. The sweetness is too much for me.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Some robust coffee in the middle, a little tropical fruit. Crisp finish with slight dry grapefruit aftertaste. Body is about medium, carbonation is moderate.

I get aromas of currants and plums with some hints of tropical fruits as well.  Really ripe flavors of basically the same with an aggressive hoppy bite on the finish and a rather luxurious texture.  OK, so here's the thing, I still think I prefer the 60 because I like what it does more than I do this. It's impressive and opulent, but I don't ever find myself wanting another which, while not uncommon for DIPAs, does put it below, say Hop Wallop and Hercules in my book.

S fresh flowery hop aroma with malty sweetness. Citrusy/lemony. Hops at the front. Should have more hop presence though (more dry hoping).  T Kind of an inverse of the aroma with malt leading the flavor profile and hops backing it up. Hops are apparent, but malt sweetness is present from start to finish. There is some Anise/licorice flavor and its a little cloying.  M Medium body, a lttle light on carbonation, not bad, just could use more. Nice rich feel.

S - The hops are present but not overwhelming. Noticeable pine aroma with a hint of citrus fruit and malt.  T - A distinct piney-hop character hits the palette up front followed by a nice bready maltiness. The alcohol is not trying to hide in this beer and you definitely can sense it in the finish, but in a good way.  M - Pleasantly sticky yet smooth, like a light syrup.  D - At 9% abv I would have to classify this beer as dangerously drinkable. Yes, the alcohol is noticeably present but in such a way that it beckons you to take another sip.

Alcohol is quite present.  M-The mouthfeel is pretty good but I still can't give it a high rating because I don't love the taste. Well carbonated and thick but the flavor makes the feel of this beer less than stellar.  D- Not very drinkable. I've bot a few four packs of this brew hoping to surprise myself and actually like it.

S: Hops - citrus, specifically grapefruit and lemon zest.  T: Bitter hops and citrus. It had a dry sweetness similar to a grapefruit. There was a slight caramel ""maltiness"" in the background that cropped up now and again. The alcohol was well masked in the beginning, but has it got warmer it became more apparent.

A - Orange/honey in color with one finger of head that doesn't stay long but leaves behind beautiful lacing.  S - Floral notes and fresh hops with a little citrus, mostly grapefruit.

The taste is a sweet, biscuity malt up front, slight hints of caramel and vanilla in the middle, and a dry hop bitterness in the finish, with a tropical hop taste throughout.  M.

10099,2093,TheHoppiest,4.85,"This beer falls into the category of one I've wanted to review for a while. While I've always loved beer, I'd have to say that Dogfish Head's 90 Minute IPA was the first beer that made me realize that beer can be every bit as complex, tasty, and enjoyable a drinking experience as good wine or scotch. It was this very beer that demonstrated to me that what I had thought was ""good"" beer was really nothing more than mass-marketed swill pretending to be sophisticated.  With that said:  I poured from a 12 oz bottle into an oversized snifter. Pours a honey-gold color, with a white foamy head that reduces to a thin blanket of head.  Smells hoppy; citrus and pine, with a fair amount of malt and a slight yeastiness to it. There's also an underlying fruity-sweet smell of apricots and grapes, with a hint of alcohol.  Mmmmm, what a wonderfully tasting brew. It starts bold and hoppy, spicy and warm. Lemon and other citrus, sweet malt, and alcohol warmth underlie a resiny astringency that flows over and around the tongue while simultaneously drying it out. Finishes much smoother than you'd expect from an imperial IPA. Though it isn't cask conditioned, it has some characteristics of a cask conditioned IPA.  Highly drinkable, you just have to be careful that you don't knock yourself on your keister with this 9% brew. I can't recommend this one enough!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,mcnkuckles,4.72,"One of my favorite IPA's of all time. Also had this beer at a special tasting put on by the brewery at a pub. The color is very rich, almost an amber color, with very sharp hop and spice notes that pop into you olfactory receptors as you raise the glass to your mouth. Taste is very bitter, yet it is smooth and finished with subtly sweet, almost caramel flavor. This beer is thicker than most IPA's, and packs a very strong alcohol content, and is therefore understandably not exceptionally drinkable, yet hard to stop drinking!! If you drink an entire 4 pack, you should definitely tie yourself to the couch!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,damndirtyape,4.26,"Single bottle (bottled on 05/13/10) poured into a shaker pint glass.  Appearance: Poured a 1/4"" dense off-white head that died down to a 1/8"" persistent head across the top of the beer. Plenty of thick walls of lacing down the glass as I drank it down. The beer is a nice clear coppery-orange color with plenty of bubbles coming up through the beer.  Smell: When first poured, there is a mild sweet malt + grapefruit smell. As it warms up the smell is not as pronounced, and the smell is more of a mild grapefruit hoppy smell along with some lemon/citrus smells. For a beer that has been hopped this much, it's remarkably muted in aroma - at least to my nose anyway.  Taste: This is an incredibly well balanced beer. There is a grapefruit citrus taste followed immediately by a balancing sweet malt, then a hit of bitterness followed by a very smooth finish. For an imperial IPA this is not a face-slap of hops, and yet is hoppy enough to be notable. The malts do an excellent job of not making this beer too extreme in any one direction. It's quite good.  Mouthfeel: Pleasantly thick and smooth, with just a hint of carbonation on the tongue. Very nice body to this beer.  Drinkability: Even at 9% ABV, this is a very drinkable beer. I really want another one and sadly I only bought one bottle. The beer went very well with a hot summer meal (BLT sandwich and salad) and I know it would be good with many other meals.

Flavors that stand out are fresh pineapple, pine, and grapefruit notes. I taste some apple tartness. The sticky pine notes are remarkable. The mouthfeel is smooth and somewhat heavy. The alcohol is warming. This beer is very easy to drink.

T: again not what I was expecting: very vinous overall in character, with plenty of sweetness, citrus hops, and plenty of honey, there is a medicinal note I detected in the first taste which I could never duplicate - probably just the punch of hops! - alcohol is detectable and most pronounced in the middle; the finish is hopped, but mixed with a lingering sweetness and plenty of ester, ripe apple, grape and a hint of citrus.

S - A little sweet, almost candy like. I think it's the barley that stands out in the nose of this beer. Maybe a little caramel as well.  T - A great IPA. All of the praise that this beer has received is well worth it.  D - Just about perfect, esp for a 9%ABV. Goes down super smooth and the sweet taste wants you coming back for more.

A: Dark brown but hints of red-orange when held up to light. Minimal white head but lots of lacing left on the glass.  S: HOPS ... and some fruits too.  T: Bitter citrus hops that would allude to a bitter finish, but some sort of combination of the citrus and the bitterness from hops and high ABV makes a crisp finish.  M: Very smooth for an imperial IPA. Somehow the sweetness in this brew is something I've never seen from a beer like this, and there something in the sweet ending that begs for more of it.

Head dissipated at a moderate rate. Carbonation bubbles floated to the top for several minutes. Minor cascading lace.  Smell: Grapefruit/hops mostly. After the first sip and all others thereafter there was an odd odor present which I am left to describe as a pissy diaper smell. I don't know any other way to say it. This is only detected when sniffing the contents of the glass. It is not on the palate otherwise I would have tossed the brew forthwith.  Taste: Hops bitterness present. Grapefruit. As I put some distance on this beer the hops taste became more prevalent.  Mouthfeel: There was a thickness in this beer which surprised me. It wasn't cough syrup thick but it was getting there. The mouth began to get that numbing sensation fairly quick. Feels like a beer meant to be a beer.  Drinkability: This seems like a stronger beer with a bit of a punch in terms of affecting the senses.

A - Pours a golden copper with an orange hue, slight haze, and thin layer of head which dissipates into small islands with some lacing.  S - The citrus and pine hops are prominent off the top. Little bit fruity with some pineapple present as well, and a bit of a peppery finish.  T - The bitter citrus hops are delicious, and the high ABV goes unnoticed. Some mild chocolate hops balance out this delicious ale, and a woody flavour lingers on the finish.  M - A little on the syrupy side due to the low level of carbonation, however, that being said, it is by no means a turn off. Still goes down extremely smooth.

Taste: Pornographic. It almost makes you feel bad it tastes so good. Bitterness at first with a sweet aftertaste, EXACTLY what I look for in an IPA. The alcohol taste is certainly there, but it's gonna be when you hit the 9% ABV mark.  Mouthfeel: Slightly thick for my taste, but the taste makes up for it!

T: Unfortunately, the alcohol flavor jumps to the front, and while it's not quite overwhelming, it's a large part of the flavor, which I don't find pleasant. But what's to the side of it, and behind it IS quite nice. Hoppy, not very bitter. But the ratio of alcohol really hurts it for me. If that flavor was hidden more, and the others more emphasized, I would like it a lot better.  M: Soft, micro carbonation, but again the alcohol ratio leaves an unpleasant feeling.

It's incredibly hoppy, but fails to extract and retain some of the best qualities of the hops it's brewed with. Although its complex flavor profile leaves the drinker with a lot to explore, the bitterness inhibits its drinkability and makes this beer hard to enjoy.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,flagmantho,3.78,"Poured from 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: rich golden-orange hue with a crystal-clear body. Head is two solid fingers of bubbly light-tan foam. It's making me thirsty already.  Smell: big earthy/funky hop aroma against what smells like a biscuity malt background. I like it well enough, though I'm not in love with the biscuit.  Taste: big, rich malt flavor with a deep and complex hop character. The malt is thick and, though less biscuity than the aroma, has a bit of that quality to it. Hops start of with a bit of a bite and then transform to a funky headiness. At the end is a rich bitterness which works very well. I like it.  Mouthfeel: medium-thick body with a level of carbonation which seems high to me for the style (though I like a good carb, so it works for me). The overall textural effect is rather refreshing.  Drinkability: this is a pretty drinkable beer overall, but I find the hops a little too jarring to be really refreshing. That, plus the slightly-overly-biscuity malt bill detract a bit from this beer's drinkability. It's still quite good, though.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,magine,4.47,"Brew poured into a Duvel glass.  Pours a slightly hazy copper colored brew, with an off white head. Head is thick and fluffy, settles to a lace island and has decent lacing. Good looking brew, especially for a high alcohol brew.  Brew smells of hops, barley, caramel, citrus notes, floral notes, yeasts. Great nose.  Brew is hoppy, nice hop flavor; citrus, and then barley malts. Has a crisp peppery hop flavor initially in the mouthfeel. Then the barley malts are in there to smooth things out. Finishes slightly dry. Has a certain sweetness to it, but not overdone. Can taste a tiny hint of alcohol in the aftertaste. Caramel malts, and some fruits as well as it warms. Absolutely delicious IPA.  This is the quintessential IPA for me. I know it is an Imperial/Double, but who cares I want the flavors in my IPA. Delivers enough hops to make you notice, then has the barley malts to even things out. Extremely drinkable, extremely delicious. This brew is one of my all time favorites, I forgot how damn good it was. Another world class brew, from a world class brewery.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,cpetrone84,4.38,"Draft from Fatheads on 7/1/10  Update on the taste and aroma, the rest is pretty accurate. Rating on those from recent tasting and went up from previous bottle rating.  S-The nose is bready with caramel malts up front. Peach and citrus are present behind, huge balance and interesting aroma.  T-taste follows the nose, huge malt presence, lots of toasted bread and some caramel, good hop backing, notes of peach and citrus, hints of herbal marijuanna and grapefruit, light lingering bitterness.  Overall-love the balance now, very pleasant and still has a great hop presence but a beautiful malt balance make this a great bear to enjoy and I can actually keep drinking it unlike many of my favorite hop bombs that make me suffer towards the end of a growler.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

M - Carbonation is present, but the feel of the mouth is full, but silky.  D - I don't buy the ABV, as I am just getting started. I could quaff down a few more and be happy.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,STEG,4.48,"Pours a wonderful deep orange color into a snifter. Smells of Grapefruit and Brown Sugar up front Pine and Lemon rind at the end. Taste is quite sweet brownsugar and hops up front with a boozy middle and a mildly bitter end. Mouthfeel has noticeable but not at all unpleasant alcohol warming, with a definitive syrupy character but both are well balanced making this quite nice to drink. It is easy to drink given its alcohol content but I would tend to shy away from any more than 3 at once, and 3 is a bit of a stretch.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,artcurtis,3.57,"Poured from a bottle into a Sam Adams perfect pint. Very cloudy, almost the color of a white ale, a little coppery. Pours a big two fingered head that hangs around for a little bit. Smell is unremarkable, malt and hops, nothing special. Definitely not as hoppy smelling as I was expecting/hoping. The first thing I noticed in the taste was the bitter, and then the rest came forward. Not bad, but different. VERY malty for an IPA. Not the mini hop bomb I was expecting. Definitely hoppy, but I think they tried to balance it a bit too much. Just a hint of flowery west coast style hops, but pretty understated. Overall, I enjoyed it, but pretty disappointed and underwhelmed. A pretty unremarkable beer, I'd drink it again but I would go out of my way.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,bigdonniebrasco,4.55,"Do you love hops? Then this is you ale. It looks, smells, and taste hoppy. It pours a cloudy yellow/orange with a nice cream-yellow head full of alpha acids. The aroma pure fresh green hop. If you have ever picked hops you know that fresh slightly oily, slightly earthy green aroma. The hop taste is balanced with an assertive yet low key maltiness that seems to support the hops rather than battle with them. 90 IBU's and 9% ABV and you will be warm and hoppy all night long. Dogfish Head is known for pushing the envelope and this ale does just that. This is an ale that is meant to be and is BITTER.

Not a lot of hop aroma present except a slight tropical fruit.  Taste was very balanced. Malty sweet upfront and definately boozy. Bitter finish.  Mouthfeel was medium bodied.

Hops are big and lean more in the pine direction but there is some herbal citrus in there.  M- chewy and full bodied with a nice mid level carb.  D- very little sign of the abv and for what it is I can totally dig it. For sure its an east coast ipa.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,DovaliHops,4.35,"Poured an orangish-red color...wouldn't really call it amber. Has a very nice frothy white head to it. Aroma is extremely sweet candy sugars, sweet malts, and light hops. Living on the west coast, this does not smell like your typical DIPA. Also get a bit of melon in the nose. Taste is amazing. This is the beer that kinda got me started and hooked on Dogfish Head. Taste is just so well balanced. If you were to compare this to a west coast DIPA, it would almost be like comparing apples to oranges IMO. There's so much more malt and candy sweetness to this brew. The 60 minute is a nice toned down version of this, but they have so many similarities. The high abv (9%) is barely noticeable...until it starts to warm up. I suggest drinking this beer at around 40 degrees. You don't miss out on any of the smells or flavor, but you do miss out on the alcohol making itself a leading member of your taste buds. This beer has an amazing mouthfeel with INCREDIBLE drinkability. I love this beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,SpdKilz,3.91,"Appearance - Pours into my SA Perfect Pint with a relatively clear, dark amber color. Over three fingers of chunky, tan colored head are achieved that is dissipating quite slowly, leaving some great looking lacing. One of the better looking beers I've had as of late.  Smell - Honestly, the aroma given off is quite light in my opinion. Sweet malt hits me at the start which gives way to slight hops and citrus. I'll be curious to see how this one tastes.  Taste - A rush of sweet malt, honey, and caramel attack my palate as soon as the beer touches it. I had this beer about a year ago when my palate was inexperienced but even then I remember it being nothing like other DIPA's I had tried (i.e. very malty). This beer has about two months on it, so it is still relatively fresh, however, the prominence of sweetness is quite evident. Once the overpowering sweetness fades, the bitter hops become more prominent. Actually, the more you drink of this the less sweet it becomes and the more the hops become evident. There is slight citrus, and a hint more of pine.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel, decent carbonation.  Drinkability - For the abv, drinkable. For me personally, too sweet. I preferred the 60 minute to this to be perfectly honest. This beer is just the epitome of an ""East Coast DIPA"" and to be frank, I don't particularly care for it. Glad I got to try it again and review it, but I'm thankful I only had to purchase a single (which is why I haven't reviewed this sooner - couldn't justify buying a four pack again).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,strangemusic,4.45,"Comparing this to the 60 Minute is really night and day. The 60 is an excellent and refreshing companion, but the 90 feels more mature and powerful.  It's also bloody good.  It poured into my Duvel glass with a small white head, thin and bubbly; surprisingly, it didn't leave a ton of lace or stickiness. The beer itself is a really gorgeous orange amber colour.  The smell is of rich hops, florals and fresh bread, with lemony and brown sugar undertones. Sweet and mellower than expected. Nice balance.  The taste shows similarly fine balance, and for that it must be commended. It's got rosemary, lemon, rich (not astringent) hops and spicy/floral notes, but on the other hand retains a big malty and sweet character with brown sugar, bread and earthy tones. I personally really like the sweetness of it, especially as it blends with lingering hoppy flavours long into the finish of the sip.  Mouthfeel is also well done, it's slick but not overly oily or mouth-sappingly dry. Full, fresh and smooth.  The drinkability is a bit of a conundrum. Nine per cent alcohol makes for a big, warming presence in this beer, and in terms of its flavour and feel it's built to savour rather than quaff. Just drinkable enough to have one bottle and be satisfied for a while.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I'm a fan of IPA's and the taste of this one is a step above the rest. Having had the 60 min version it is definitely a step above even if you can only get it in four packs. This light malt flavor and strong presence of hops is something that you have to try if your a fan of IPAs.

Taste is full, this beer is heavy on both malts and hops in the extreme. Malts are quality, chocolaty with a butter aftertaste, hops tangy all the way through with piney bitterness and finishes both crisp and sweet.  Personally, quality beer, too heavy on malts and, frankly and simply, too much sheer flat flavor and, more pointedly, it's not an American IPA as I think of it because the pure strength of the malt simply suffocates the hops. This is a good brew, just too sweet for me but also lacks complexity and subtlety to be a great beer, which is what this is trying to be given its profile.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,voteforgoat,3.82,"bottle poured into large wine glass.  A- orangey, copper colored brew, thin head with low retention. Not very bubbly. Thin lacing.  S- Both flowery and malty.  T- A bit disappointing, as I had high expectations for the uniqueness of this beer. It tastes more like a barley wine than anything. It's not all that different from aged Big Foot. Get some Big Foot with about 6 months on it ( basically the stuff on the shelves now) and find out for yourself. Or maybe some Moylan's or Lagunitas barley wine? It has a strong malty backbone like Big Foot, but it is more floral and less bitter than new Big Foot. The malty-ness is a bit sweet actually, like some belgians. It's an interesting balance. It's both malty sweet and hoppy. Def. not as hoppy as I expected from reading about this beer, but that's OK.  F- Much fuller bodied than other IIPA I've had ( which admittedly are few). Almost thick. I finished the glass and the left-over beer even looks a bit viscous as it slides down the glass. That's actually another reason why I think this beer is more like a barley wine than any kind of IPA. It's a somewhat heavy beer. It's not very similar to PtE, which is what I think when it comes to IIPAs. It's also on the flat side unfortunately.  D-I could drink a couple of these ( if I don't have to drive). The alcohol is a bit warming, so maybe not the best BBQ beer ( though I think it would match quite well with BBQ ribs).

I get a lot of malt in the smell with some herbal hops in the background.  the taste is very sweet, this really is a malt bomb and almost seems fruity, though i wouldn't call it citrus. the hops are on the back burner in this one and really only attempt to counteract the sweetness afforded by the malts.  medium-full bodied, somewhat syrupy. coats the mouth.

Smell is decidedly hoppy with slightly malty overtones  Taste is surprisingly sweet for an IPA. Tastes almost like a Bavarian Doppelbock with a kick of hops.

S- Wonderful hoppy aroma expected of an IPA, not overpowering like those of the Pacific Northwest. Much milder than I expected. T- Delicious. I could have one or two of these a day and be happy as hell. IPAs being my favorite, this is one of the top ten for sure.

10099,2093,dpasotti,4.02,"90 Minute is glassy tangerine-bronze in color with a good head of foam for a 9% beer. Plentiful lacing appears as the fluid level falls. An awesome hop blast hits my nose along with alcohol and sweet-ish malt. The combination of hops is such that I can't pick out a single strain easily.  The flavor is surprisingly different. A very forward malt presence makes for an interestingly-balanced double IPA. American hops of all flavors yield an amalgam of flavors including resiny pine, spicy herbs, and an earth/woody character. This brew is ""off-centered"" from most of the extreme citrus bombs that are double IPAs. There is an underlying sweetness from the hefty malt frame that holds everything in place well. My only real complaint is that the alcohol seems a bit hot for 9%.  The body is moderate initially, but the oily hop resins seem to lend some thickness as they taper the long finish in a pleasant way. 90 Minute is absolutely one of Sam's best beers. It is well-crafted and original in every way.

Lots of lacing left behind.  Taste- The alcohol is evident in this one, but it is not overpowering. I bought a case of this a few months ago, and the hoppiness has started to deteriorate. Now, it's sweeter, maltier, but still delicious. The mouth feel is smooth.  Overall- I love this beer, so I'm prejudiced in its favor, but I find that it has aged well. Despite the fact that I love hops, I don't mind the taste as the beer ages. It's bitter, but not so bitter to deter non-traditional IPA drinkers from giving it a try.

10099,2093,jhire70,4.25,"The color is a clear rusty orange. That had an ivory colored head with a long retention.  The lacing is evident after the head subsides and it gently falls back into the glass followed by oily remnants that also fall even slower almost like a wine.  The alcohol is hidden and this is an incredibly smooth double ipa that is very dangerous cause at 9% alcohol you could easily find yourself 3 or 4 glasses in.  The smell is slightly citrus but is overwhelmed by the stronger scents of honey, toffee, chocolate/coffee and a touch of molasses. The smell is very rich,and almost savory.  Mouthfeel is heavy, smooth, and not dry at all in fact you could almost detect a slight oiliness after drinking. This beer also has a medium level of carbonation.  The taste is complex. When it is cold the 90 Minute is much more crisp but still has a whole heck of malt to go with that. After the beer warms the crispness sneaks away and you are treated to sweet toffee honey slight chocolate/coffee and molasses flavors. The finish seems to change with each sip. Sometimes you get a slightly floral/citrus finish and other times you get a burnt tobacco/espresso finish both of which I enjoyed.  This is a great beer that a wide range of beer and even wine lovers could enjoy. Despite its 9% abv its incredibly drinkable and definitely has characteristics of other styles of beer.

10099,2093,AndyAvalanche,3.98,"Poured into a standard glass. Looks very good for the style. Didn't expect it, but it's very clear, obviously filtered. Has a nice dark amber color to it. Not quite what I expected for a Double/Imperial IPA, but still pretty good for a beer in general. Most Double IPA's I've had are generally unfiltered. This beer has some better than average lacing to it. The smell is pretty good, not as hoppy as I expected, but the maltiness is kicked up a notch. Pretty good, but I'd expect a little more from a DIPA. I find many DIPA's to be very strong, but this one seems to be struggling to find it's identity in the smell department. The smell pretty sweet, almost a light toffee and some pine hops follow. The taste is a step up. Again it's pretty heavy on the malts, caramelized malts a d some citrus/pine hops to follow it up. It almost has a bit of a buttery taste to it as well. The mouthfeel is the best part in my opinion. It touches on all the major points that beer drinkers like. It's well balanced, more full bodied. Has a smooth texture (mentioned the buttery taste ealier), and not too much or too little carbonated, yet it finishes clean and a little bitter. It's a good drinkable beer as well. I found it difficult to review this beer a little based on the style. It really tasted more like a regular IPA than a Double IPA. I've had more IPA's with more DIPA characteristics than this.

10099,2093,jazzmanblue,4.13,"Tired of the poor beer quality available in my neighborhood, I took a trip to Park Slope to visit Bierkraft, a beer specialty shop, and purchased a four pack. I am always on the lookout for a good IPA, and this was the last four pack available of this particular brand.  From a 12 oz. bottle poured into my Le Merle goblet:  It has a rather pleasant coppery/amber hue, with a small head which laces nicely. Very easy on the eye, it looks like a quality brew.  The smell bring forth a mix of sensations. The first thing I noticed was the clean hops, followed by a slight sweetness. There is a fruity undertone which is difficult to define, but is rather nice. It is one of very few beers to make me elicit a slight ""wow"" while examining its aroma. I immediately liked it.  Taste: This one is good folks - enough to cause me to write my first review after being on the site for five years. It has a clear hoppy flavor with a very mild sweetness. The fiinish is nicely dry, with an aftertaste that balances bitter and sweet. It is just plain nice - and just what I look for in a brew.  Mouthfeel is not something I usually judge or look for in a beer, but this rates well - it has a solid body with no watery thinness. At the same time, it will not overwhelm you with unnecessary distractions.  The drinkability is held back by the 9% ABV. Otherwise, this would be a 4 or 4.5. For all it's strength, it is very easy to drink. The alcohol does not reveal itself in the flavor, so be careful to note the potency.  I am going back for a second bottle, and could not be more pleased.

10099,2093,Beefeater57,3.95,"A: Slightly hazy dark honey color with golden edges, solid white head. Decent retention.  S: Woodsy, pine smell. A little bit of lemon peel and very small hint of ash.  T: Unique flavor - has a caramel, almost syrup-like sweetness up front, with some bready notes. Hops don't really cut through as expected with an imperial IPA, but it is balanced. Hops sit at the back of the throat - very wood/piney hops.  M: Hop oil, slightly sticky mouthfeel. Mouthfeel throws me off a little since it has that sticky/syrupy essence to it.  D: Dogfish makes great beers, so it's definitely drinkable. I like the hop flavors/aromas even though they are not too bittering. For the price and taste however, I prefer the 60 minute.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,jpittman80,3.4,"A - Clear amber with a very thin head. It doesn't last either. I've seen higher ABV beers with much better head.  S - Yeah, I smell the hops. And the booze. But i almost feel like the malt is taking center stage here. Very roasty and some caramel. As for the ""centerpiece"" hops, some American variety aroma. It has that earthy, oniony smell that is ok in some beers, like Ruination, but it seems to clash with the roastiness.  T - I'm grading this as compared to other DIPAs. Don't get me wrong, it's a tasty brew, and one of the redeeming qualities of DFH is their propensity to experiment. Maybe overly chocolaty for an IPA, too much onion hop flavor. Pretty boozy. Not bad, but not great.  M - Very smooth and easy on the tongue. Perfect carbonation, almost alcohol warmth is there, not too bad thugh. Not very dry. You can tell, at least that this is expertly crafted.  D - I'm only gonna have one of the fourpack tonight. Not that it's ard to drink really, but I find DFH beers, with very few exceptions, are overly sweet. This one doesn't doesn't finish as dry as you'd expect an IPA to. I really wish they'd cut down on the sweetness in most of their beers. I'd enjoy them much more.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Delicious, sweet caramel scent, citrus hops. Sweet on the tongue, rich and chewy. Did I mention sweet? Alcohol and Hops are present but not overwhelming. Extremely drinkable, even with the 9% ABV. WOW ! What an AMAZING beer, extremely rich and delicious. Must have more! Highly recommended!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,garuda,2.68,"I decided to revisit this one after I was sure that I had a bad bottle the first time. This review was from a bottle drank within 40 days of its marked bottling date.  A - Poured a crystal clear deep amber, thin white head with little retention clinging to the edge of the glass and minimal lacing.  S - First whiffs are very good with pine notes, some citrus zest with a deep underlying caramel malt backbone. However, after a couple sips, the hops seem to disappear and the malt flavoring turns into more raisin, prune tasting, with alcohol becoming much more prevalent.  T - Follows the nose with similar effects as it warms. Pine and citric hop profile from front to back with caramel malts in the background in the beginning, but as it warms, pruney malts and alcohol overtake any other complexity that may be in the beer.  M - A nearly full body with ample carbonation, smooth across the palate, dry astringent finish.  D - I could drink this again as a nightcap, but I will certainly not buy this again when I'm in the mood for a DIPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,VTaler,4.62,"A - clear amber color. Small head with good lacing S - Very hoppy. Floral notes and a sweet bread aroma. T - First is of floral hops but it is quickly followed by a sweet malt flavor. Overall this beer has much flavor. Very complex. It is also very balanced. The malt is sweet but not over sweet. It goes well with the hops. The hops have kind of a spicy/floral taste. The malt is very complex but not as complex as the hops.

10099,2093,BlackHaddock,3.35,"My third and final beer in Ales&Aces (Las Vegas).  Half a pint poured into a stemmed tulip glass.  The bar is fairly dark, but you can see this is a copper coloured beer with a thin white head on top without having to ask for extra lighting.  The aroma was all hop, a fairly bitter hop aroma at that.  The beer taste was predominately hops too, although a malty aftertaste appeared as the beer warmed in the glass, it got sweeter too, as it warmed.  I thought the alcohol well hidden at first, but it did show towards the end of the tasting. It didn't become overpowering, but you could tell it was hanging around waiting to attack if you'd let it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Some notes of caramel and toffee.  T - Rich and complex. Hops notes floral and herbal. A bit of citrus too. I was pleasantly surprised by the level of malt flavor. Sweet caramel malt notes counteract the hops. Some really nice balance here. Some apple notes present too.  M - Full bodied with a fairly high carbonation level. A bit syrupy.  D - For a robust, high alcohol beer this is pretty drinkable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,madjr80,4.15,"The appearance was quite impressive. There was a nice thick puffy head of foam about three inches thick;the kind that sticks to the glass as it is consumed. The foam by itself even had a hint of hops. Foam eventually dropped down, but not until the end of the glass. The smell of hops was quite potent. The taste was very impressive. This beer is better to be consumed one or two per sitting.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,aasher,4.23,"This beer looks the way a strong IPA should. It's a darker amber color and features little, off white foam. It smells very strongly of hops with slight sweetness. It boasts good, strong hoppy flavor with sugars and tartness present on the backend. Good mouthfeel and well carbonated. Drinks very crisp. Is pretty drinkable considering the alcohol content. A four pack is definitely worth picking up, especially if you've tried a good amount of IPAs.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The body was a hazy, mildly carbonated medium amber color.  S- A wonderful aroma of rich nutty vienna malt in balance with some earthy high-alpha hops. Subtle citrus nuances, fuity esters and impressions of bread crust on the nose as well.  T- Initially, it's a wonderful replicate of the nose- nutty vienna malt and earthy hops in balance. But on the midpalate some tropical-fruit-like notes come into play... perhaps a combination of yeast esters and hops. Then the balance tips slightly towards hop bitterness in the finish, which lingers with impressions of tropical and citrus fruit.  M- A medium body with a little oily slickness to it, and a nice soft carbonation. No astringency.  D- Incredibly drinkable... dangerously quaffable... the alcohol is so well hidden. And I love the fact that the hop bitterness is always kept in check- never becoming overbearing.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S: Very sweet and fruity. Cane sugar, passion fruit, papaya, mango, tangerine, grapefruit, roses and other floral notes over a grassy hop backbone. Very delicious. Slight notes of alcohol as well. T: Fruity and sweet like the nose with a lot more of the bitter grassy hops coming through to balance the sweetness. I get a lot of juicy passion fruit and papaya. Caramely malt undertones are present as well in between hop punches. M: Carbonation is very soft and smooth, body is thick and slippery, and alcohol is fairly well hidden. Hops are bitter and well balanced by the fruit sweetness and malt undertones. D: No matter if on tap or in the bottle, this is one of my favorite DIPA's. It is a very well balanced brew, albeit a little on the sweet side. One of the best offerings from DFH. Cheers!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Naugros,4.13,"NOTE: I am tasting this after trying the 60-Minute IPA, which I wound up giving a B+.  As one would expect the appearance of this beer is nearly identical to that of 60-Minute. It's amber to light-orange in color with a head that rises and then falls to a foamy coating on the top. Bands of lace cling to the side of the .5 ounce wheat glass I use for tasting.  The smell is nearly identical as well, but the sense of grapefruit is more assertive rather than just the general ""citrusy"" smell of the 60-Minute. However, I do get more of the malt in the nose than in 60-Minute. Maybe I agitated the surface more for this one?  The taste is where the two depart ways. I like this a lot better. It has a much better balance to it. The caramel malt comes through on the tongue to counter the bitter grapefruit at the back of the palate. The aftertaste is also better controlled.  The bitterness is also countered by a more assertive carbonation and the higher ABV can be felt at the roof of the mouth with a bit of alcoholic ""tingle"".  Downing a few of these will get your buzz on. I doubt I could do more than two of these at a time unless I was washing down spicy food or sharp cheeses. This would go well with strong curry.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Appearance - golden amber with nice lacing and an initial 1inch head.  Smell - really like the nose on this. Apricot,honey,and a faint bit of pine tree at the end.  Taste - like biting into aan apricot and pear then hit with citrus and evergreen. Love this dipa  mouthfeel - feels full and coating in the mouth, but not overlly syrupy.

10099,2093,Thiestru,4.3,"Poured from a 12-oz. bottle into my Terrapin pint glass.  Appearance: Vibrant, clear amber with a one-finger white head. Good amount of lacing. As I've said before, I like haziness, but this looks really appetizing even without it. It's not much different from its 60-minute counterpart, but this must have a richer color (and it's bubblier); somehow it looks better.  Smell: Abundant grapefruit-like citrus and malts that impart a note of sweetness. I can smell a little alcohol, too.  Taste: Tangy, bitter hops up front, carrying that grapefruity flavor the smell suggested. Malts aren't in the spotlight; they're balancing out the flavor as they should be, but there's enough of them to make another pleasant aspect to the beer, especially since they really come out in the aftertaste. The alcohol is only slightly noticeable.  Mouthfeel: Pretty good body here, not like a stout of course, but enough. Wateriness is never a good thing in a beer, I think, and this gives that flaw wide berth.  Drinkability: I like to drink beer. I like IPAs. This is a very good IPA. Needless to say, that makes drinkability for this quite high.  I'm definitely more impressed by this than I was by the 60-minute IPA I had yesterday. This is something worth having around. Now if only I could find the 120-minute version....",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,NightINgale,4.38,"A - Looks absolutely stunning! Deep amber body, with a slight cloudiness to it. A rich creamy beige head. Great head retention and impressive lacing.  S - The smell is extremely intense, but it is quite a challenge to tell whether there is more maltiness or hoppiness in it. I also got some tropical fruit notes, like mango and papaya. The list of aromatic notes includes, but is not limited to: caramel, bread, toffee, oranges, grapefruit, pine needles, even chocolate!  T - Hops, more hops, then malts, and more malts! Packs a very good hop punch, with equal amounts of resinous pine and citrusy grapefruit, with some bitterness. The malts bring a very nice sweet breadiness to the finish, which is definitely more on the malty side. Not much bitterness lingers on. Very flavourful and balanced.  M - Medium-to-full body to it. Smooth, but slightly sticky and syrup-like.The alcohol is well-masked, but you will probably feel it. After a while, it gets a bit more difficult to swallow.  D - Enjoy this one in moderation, as it gets tricky with the well-masked 9% abv.  All in all, now I can totally see why this beer is so acclaimed.

Mouthfeel -- Medium-heavy body, medium carbonation, a little prickly, and a mildly biting booze finish.  Drinkability -- While this is still a solid beer, I found it to be too sweet and cloying, and even for its abv I found it to be a little too boozy.

10099,2093,rawthar,4.07,"Finally got around to reviewing one of my first favorite crafts.  A- A clear ruby red rye color with a sticky dense white head that defies gravity against the sides of the glass.  S- Citrus and grass hops become more pronounced as the beer warms, breaking through a hefty wall of grainy, buttery malt sweetness. But once those hops find their way out, they aim to please.  T- The first flavor that breaks onto the scene is a dry, grassy hop flavor, but this is swiftly chased away by a pasty, thick, sweet malt, an alcoholic flavor that I didn't pick up on until I had the 120 and got it in spades. Now I can't miss it. This is a strong IPA, and very unique in the level of malt intensity.  M- With the strong malt comes a thick, sticky feel with a decent carbonation attack to the tongue.  D- I used to put these suckers back like they're going out of style, now I find it a little heavy to be a multi-drinker, but then I usually don't drink more than a few anyway.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Small pockets of large bubbles rise from the bottom, although the nucleation point on the tulip is providing a spectacular fireworks display of bubbles. Moderate lacing.  Smell - Citrus hops and pine. Little bit of pineapple. Caramel malt hidden underneath the hoppy goodness. Really inviting aroma.  Taste - Bingo! Matches the aroma. The citrusy and piney hop flavors really come alive from the second it hits your tongue. Malt is noticeable at the very beginning before being enveloped by a carpet bombing of hops. Surprisingly, it does maintain a nice balance as the sweetness emphasizes and brings out the citrusy and sappy nature of the hops. Wonderfully vicious bitterness at the end. The pineapple/caramel flavors stick around long after the sip is gone alongside the bitterness.  Mouth Feel - Full bodied, slightly chewy, coats the mouth with stickiness and smooth carbonation.  Drinkability - Had this before, but not in a while. I'm absolutely in love with this beer. It has everything I ever look for in an IPA/DIPA. Citrus hop dominated flavor profile (love that grapefruit bitterness), a little pine, and a nice malt backbone to give the beer a little depth. Big bodied without sacrificing palatability and the alcohol is stealthy. Plus, it looks gorgeous. Fantastic drinkability and a fantastic DIPA. Where's the 9%?

This beer is a very pretty one.  S- Malty sweet matched with some piney hops. Lots of caramel, peaches, oranges and grapefruit with pine resin. The smell isnt very big. I think this beer would benefit nicely from a bit more hops in the aroma.  T- This is a very good IIPA. Its very good in a different way than most other IIPAs that I like. Normally I love big, fruity, tropical hop character. This definitely has some of that sweetness, but its different. There is lots of caramel and doughy malts laying along side sweet and bitter citrus and piney hops. I think the pine flavors win out and finish the taste with a nice bitterness. The fruits are like apricots, oranges and sweetened grapefruit.  M- Dry, full-medium body, slight stickiness.  D- A very nice and refreshing beer.

M - Smooth, sweet  D - 2 oz. was just about enough for me. For what it's worth, I had just had several imperial stouts and some 8-year aged Raison D'extra, so this may have had something to do with it.

A bit like both malt and hops were smoked. Lots of alcohol. Pretty complex.  T- Not sure what that taste is but I'm guessing it's the massive amount of barley the label talks about. This is a malty beer. Hops of course but a very floral hoppy and in one of the softest ways. Not much of a hop bite (sharp citrus or pine) and very little bitterness compared to other IIPAs. You do get a taste of fresh hops when you burp. A bit of dark fruit but can't quite put my finger on it. Doesn't really taste like maple syrup but reminds me of it. Pretty damn close to delicious. Just got what I was looking for: It's amaretto or some other kind of almond liqueur. Really... hoppy amaretto.  M- Not much carbonation. Thick and full but could still feel refreshing... if served cold enough. Sticky and syrupy.  D- Pretty good. Tastes great like a very light desert so you want more but I don't know how many pints I could take.  I thought this was going to be a hop bomb. It isn't. It's a malt and flavor bomb. Lot's of stuff going on. Alcohol gets to you. Had it on an empty stomach early in the day and I can say I'm kind of dizzy. Very interesting and a must try if you love beer.

Sadly, I only bought one bottle. The 9% ABV is not too well hidden, but I don't mind.  Overall: Quite satisfied with this IPA. Tastes great, packs an alcoholic punch and goes down easy. Highly enjoyable. Simple, yet effective. I'd recommend it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Great amber color, head formation and retention. Bright, fresh hops on the nose rounded by an underlying malty sweetness. The hops might not be as fresh as you would like but a few months hasn't hurt this beer too much. It has a supple texture without being overly malty like some high ABV imperials can err towards. The hops are at the fore throughout. Start to finish the malt stays in the background, allowing the hops to be prominently displayed without being overpowering.

Moderately clear amber colour with a small but creamy off-white head. Good head retention and a nice bit of lacing.  The flavour is good for something that has travelled all the way to Australia. Moderate hop flavour focused on the citrus end of the spectrum with a moderately strong bitterness. It is all balanced very well by the malt which is biscuity, smooth and very tasty.

There is also some alcohol flavor, but honestly, this is incredibly balanced, and nothing is too strong. Very impressed with how this works together.

Incredible lacing.  S: Mm, hops and more hops. But under the obvious smells are more complex scents - malt, pine, and some light fruit, to name a few.  T: Exceptional. Sweet and creamy, full-bodied and delicate. Hops swirl around with malts in an outrageously well-blended flavour. Fruity alcohols follow with floral notes mingling in, and finally a bready aftertaste leads you out. I did not expect this much complexity and sheer flavour from a beer which appeared so unassuming.  M: Pleasant. Sweet and warming. Not too much to say; still blown away by the flavour.  D: At 9%, this is a hefty brew, but it doesn't always feel like it.

Odd- maybe an older bottle, or maybe my tastes have just changed, but there's an almost barleywine-like maltiness in this one.

10099,2093,Briken,3.58,"90 minute IPA pours a light amber with some sunny edges with a huge tan merengue foam. A nice piney hop aroma with barley in the background. This has a very deep hop taste counter balanced by a thick barley base. This is balanced with a tip of the scales in the barley direction. The hops start to permeate a sweet flavor after a little while with the bitterness finishing well. A generous barley coating paints the tongue throughout.  I'm really torn on this one. On one hand, the taste of this one is fantastic. It is enjoyable to drink with nice complexities and balance. On the other, I was expecting a DIPA. After the wonderful hops of the 60 I thought this would be a bolder version. Such is the problem with assumptions and perhaps this is my fault. Unfortunately, I really see this one as a lighter barley wine due to the huge barley taste and feel. I have to say I feel a little let down because of my expectations. But then again, DFH has made their reputations on turning expectations on their head.  This really is a good beer, I just wasn't in the mood for a light Barleywine. Knowing that now I can be ready if I ever want another one. Ultimately though it's supposed to be a DIPA and I just didn't get that from this beer so have to review accordingly.  edit:4/5/11 I still don't think this is much of a DIPA but it is still a very drinkable beer with great balance. I would add it has a bit of pepper and citrus as well. It has a bit of a musty aroma and I would bet this beer can change with a bit of time but without a date, who knows?

Nice lacing sticks to the glass.  Smell: Robust hop aroma, with a fuller spectrum as it warms. Earthy and floral notes predominate. The complex nose makes it difficult to distinguish the various aromas.  Taste: Although the taste is somewhat balanced with a moderate malt presence and even possesses a caramel sweetness, the real draw is the hops. With quite a few types, the complexity on the tongue is a real treat. Sweet fruits, pine and floral hops, soft grapefruit, and lemon rind all have a noticeable presence. Finishes with a sweet and bitter twist, with a mildly bitter aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: A creamy and oily feel, and the crisp carbonation bites just a little bit. The combined effect creates a smooth effect, while letting the flavor pop as well.  Drinkability: To me, the 90 minute has the best balance of depth and complexity of the Dogfish Head offerings. Carefully constructed, with a great taste and full aroma that make it a pleasure to drink.

Smell: At first waft, this stuff smells a lot like whiskey. Very smoky, similar to Sam Adams Scotch Ale minus the earthiness. 90 Minute IPA is VERY strong throughout. Spicy hops and sweet malts definitely come across as well.  Taste/Mouthfeel: The Best. There's a lot fair amount of smokiness, something that definitely comes through in the perfect combination of hops and malt. Tastes like pine. In a paradoxical manner, this beer remains pretty cold but tastes very warm, definitely an outstanding feature in my opinion. While 90 Minute IPA holds a lot of carbonation, you do not feel that at all. It definitely warms and increases in bitterness as you drink, and begs you to drink more. You will feel it from head-to-toe. In this category, this beer is one of a kind for me!  Drinkability: It comes in a 4-pack. So take a hint. You won't need more. In this category, this is beer.

10099,2093,mmva321,4.25,"Poured into a tulip.  Dogfish Head is one of those brewers I really struggle with. Their beer is created with the best of intentions and with a level of inventiveness and whimsy that demands a certain place in my beer heart. However, most beers I have from them fail to endure themselves to me at the same level as the people who work there. Not with this beer though, uncharacteristically simple and straightforward, this beer is made great by the tried and true methods from decades past. It's the best Dogfish Head has to offer.  A: The beer is a beautiful amber color, a little yellow, a little brown and a lot of orange that thins out at the bottom. Delicate but consistant beads of carbonation rise up the side to a delicate white head that leaves some intricate lacing on the side.  S: Sweet for an IPA. Punchy hops and bready yeast really highlight a very well balanced smell that comes across with a big hit of lemon. It all seems infused and creates a very eathy but bright auroma.  T: If this beer doesn't quite live up to the other great Imperial IPAs, for me, it's because of the aftertaste. When you first taste it it's the hops that hit you square. Bitter, bitter, bitter. But at fist, this is infused very well with the sweetness I picked up in the smell as well as with the lemon. But then, unfortunately, the taste of the just grows and grows, drowning out the other flavors until all you're left with is a dry bitterness that is a little too unpleasant.  M: The body is well done. It's appropriately thin with good carbonation to make it seem substantial. However, as the bitterness grows, so does the dryness in my mouth. It does make me want to drink more though...  D: ...and if I'm that anxious to continue on with the beer, it's done something right. Fun and surprising without being complicated or convoluted.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Kinsman,4.1,"Poured from 12oz bottle into snifter. Bottled on date:12/02/09  Pourse a briant amber color, with lighter hints of orange. Creamy off-white colored head, with some stickyness to it. Head fades to leave a nice lace wrapping around the glass.  Aroma is obviously hoppy, and leaning towards the more citrusy hops, but really not as much as others in the style. With the bottle being 4 months old, its hard to tell if maybe the hop notes were stronger when it was fresh, or if there is enough backbone from the malt that the hops are somewhat disguised. That being said, there is some sweetness in the aroma from the malt.  Taste is quite wonderful IMO. Hoppy, but not a palate buster, with a good citrusy flavor and rather enjoyable bitterness. At 4 months of age, the hop flavors seem like they may have toned down a bit, but not so much as if it had been cellared. Really, it just makes the malt backbone a bit more noticeable, with hints of dark fruit seeming to provide the sweetness.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with the alcohol cleverly hidden until the finish.  Overall, like many fine D.I.P.A.'s this one goes down quite well and it is easy to drink a few of these before one notices the alcohol.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,dwilson01,4.42,"Poured from a bottle into my arrogant bastard pint glass. A perfect creamy white head that is leaving some nice lacing as it recedes and clings to the glass sides. Has a golden orange look to it with a middling amount of bubbles from the carbonation bubbling up. Slightly hazy, definitely looks like an ipa which bodes well.  The smell, very smooth and malty is what I get initially. The hopping must not be too bitter or it's just brewed with a ridiculous amount of sweet malted barley. Definitely the caramel kind of sweet. But I don't get any alcohol whatsoever in the nose which honestly boggles my mind.  The taste is great, the nose wasn't doing a coverup or anything, it precedes the beer wonderfully. Such a gigantic amount of malt must have been used, this brew is seriously caramel sweet, hint of citrus from the hops for sure, but what really gets me is the aftertaste. It sticks around for a long while, gives my mouth that cool refreshing feeling as the sweet malt is taken over by the hopping which isn't bitter by the standards of a west coast ipa, but you know this is hopped up for sure.  Although the flavor was pretty standard, the mouthfeel of this brew is really what I like about it. It's seriously creamy feeling in my mouth and sooo smooth as it goes down. Makes it extremely easy to drink, and very fresh feeling which is a great characteristic of an ipa.  Overall it's a great take on the ipa style which has so many variants now it's awesome and I love having one that defines its own category which this definitely does. Kudos again to Dogfish Head who has never ever let me down, always drop a lot of dough on these and it's ALWAYS worth it.

Cheddar? Enjoy this with cheese, sharp cheddar. It really brings out the sweetness of this brew.  M-- Not the strip your mouth feel I expected. THERE are the hops, they are nicely blended with the initial onset of the malt. Back of the mouth gets most of the caramel flavor, front catches the pine and hops more notably. This is a beer I can let sit in my mouth before I try and get it down. Love how smooth yet powerful this is  D-- Where's the alcohol? Easy to drink, fun to drink. It feels respectable and I can really enjoy this brew, not wondering what my next stop is going to be.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Parrotbeak,4.39,"Clear, bubbly orange with a golden hue. Thin white head that thins out partially. Smell is hops and malts up front, with the hops dominating. The smell is rather complex, with sugary, red fruits coming in (grapefruit, strawberries, and some blue grapes. Some caramel malts come in later as well. Slight burn on the nose from the alcohol. A quite unique and intriguing smell for an IPA. My review probably isn't giving it justice. Taste is hoppy up front, with malts following closely behind. The malts become bready as they progress, with some pineapple and citrus joining in. Bitter wave from the hops comes in halfway. Malty on the finish. Mouthfeel is crisp and biting, with a slightly dry finish. Carbonation is right on. Drinkability is pretty good, especially considering its ABV. Overall the alcohol is pretty well-concealed. Even better than the 60 minute.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Moderate carbonation, with a big 2 finger head that took a while to dissipate. Left some nice sticky and fairly thick lacing on the glass. Looks in very good shape!  S-- Big carmel malt smell to start that let way to pine and grapefruit. The more it opened up the more the grapefruit took over and the malt took a back seat.  T-- Pretty big malt blast to start, then came the hops. It is as if the hops are waiting to be unleashed. Very much there but they sit in the background until the right time. More of a lemon taste with touches of grapefruit.  M-- Now the hops...Big citrus and pine feel to it. Have a sort of menthol feel when after I swallow and then breathe in. Very coating and thick in my mouth. Get a good amount of sweetness to this that was not in the taste.  D-- Very drinkable.Plain and simple. Well hidden ABV and just tasty. 2 would be just right for this. Still one of the best US beers that every so often shows up in Australia and makes me want to move back.

A little frightening actually...you know the hops are there, but they seem to be lurking in the shadows, behind the malt. A little grassy citrus finishes up.  T: Largely malt that is balanced out by spicy citrus hops. A little lacking in the hop-punch, but this is probably because the large malt bill balances them out rather well.

S: Malt, then hops, with very little grapefruit, citrus, pine, etc. I have always thought that this beer is too malt heavy and lacks the classic hop aromas I expect from a DIPA.  T: The beer tastes fine, I suppose, but I always find myself a little underwhelmed when drinking 90 minute IPA. The ""balance"" of malts and hops heavily favors the malt, and leaves me yearning for that big hop aroma and taste so indicative of the style. I really have to shift my paradigm when I drink 90 minute IPA, and think of it more as a big ale, rather than a DIPA.  M: Sticky and sweet, with a malty and bitter aftertaste.  D: A decent brew, and easy to come by.  Notes: This beer ages rather well, and becomes something completely different. I cellared a case of 90 minute IPA for two years. The beer developed a molasses, caramel sweetness, the hop profile drastically faded, and the beer basically turned into an American Strong Ale.

Picking up some citrus too.  M- Theres a little bit of thickness in this. Mostly though, its a thin blast of hops, which is what I like when drinking an IPA.  D- Very drinkable! If you're not a fan of bitter beers, this probably won't work for you, but if you don't mind them, its pretty great. The hit of bitter pine near the end...god, its so refreshing!

Delicious. Awesome color and head retention with carbonation slowly rising from the bottom of the glass. Not sure you could go wrong with this beer.  S. Sweet smell with hints of citrus but primarily just hops and I love hops.  T. Interesting blend of four or five flavors that are all distinct and tasted one after another. I am reminded of Salty, Sweet, Sour, Orange, and Piney flavors which mix well with the smell. This gets a 5 because of the complexity.  M. Bubbly and tingly yet smooth as well.  D.

Definitely a solid brew and at 9.0 worth the price of admission.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,diabecktic,4.43,"Appearance: Plenty of slowly rising carbonation accompanies this pour. Around ~2 fingers of thick, white head tops this translucent, amber brew. Retention and lacing are excellent; head remains relatively thick throughout the entire tasting.  Smell: As can be inferred by what's written on the bottle, hops completely dominate the nose. I also detect a subtle citrus sweetness, but hops are clearly the focus.  Taste: The flavor is remniscient of the nose, but I detect one more flavor which isn't apparent in the nose - a subtle maple sweetness. Again, hops largely dominate the palate, but a grapefruit-like sweetness couples with a hint of maple to lend a measure of balance to the oily hop character. It's a truly exceptional sensation.  Mouthfeel: I think that the hoppy oils and maple character add some body to this beer. Its density is slightly heavier than medium, but not too thick. I find that the balance is the major element which makes this portion of the tasting enjoyable.  Drinkability: The alcohol content of this beer is very-well hidden. Since it isn't really overpowering in facet, I find that this is an easily-drinkable beer. Be careful though - that 9.0% ABV really sneaks up on you if you're not careful.  Summary: I love my IPAs and this is definately one which some might consider a ""standard."" The composition and balance are outstanding and every portion of the tasting reflects this. It's a very strong brew, but it's not ""over the top,"" so it remains accessable. Dogfish Head is known for some of their unconventional brews, but this should appeal to virtually every beer affectionado - try one if you haven't done so already. Hopefully, you'll add it to your list of favorites as I have.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Citrus - specifically grapefruit - with some pine and earthy notes.  T - Bitter hops. Grapefruit with some floral notes. Smooth.  M - Medium body with some chew. It has an exceptional silky texture to it - similar to a nitro effect. Just enough carbonation.  D - A very drinkable DIPA.

S-strong esters and a very hoppy backbone filled with piney, earthy, and mild floral notes. Small amounts of biscuit and sweet bread are evident with some dark fruit barely coming through.  T-the hop oils attack your taste buds in a aggressive manner that yields quickly to unreal amounts of alternate flavour. My tastebuds are confused!! It takes generous pulls of this sweet nectar to even begin to grasp its complexity. I love the rich doughy forefront that is immediatly tackled by hop oils and fruity esters.

Smells very big and balanced, the hops qualities are many...but mostly a big resinous pine smell with less on the fruitiness of hops.  Glug glug glug  The flavor hits me first with a balance of robust English barley and a smaller hop presence that grows after just a moment. The taste is bitter herbs and has stickiness on the tongue that causes the flavor to last a long time.

This one completely changed the way I think...from 'what beer would go well with this food'...'to what foods go well with this beer'  For me....it's now primarily the question of a good beer with foods that happen to compliment...rather than the other way around.

Aroma a rich mixture of spicy hops and malt with freshly cut-grass flavored overtones.  An initial bombardment of heavy, spicy, rich malt with a well-timed transition toward an eclectic variety of moderately bitter hops that linger on the rear pallet. The malt is strong in this one and - in my opinion -- not quite balanced by the moderately bitter hops. Nevertheless, a very tasty IPA.  Mouthfeel is borderline brilliant: thick, smooth, perfect carbonation.  Drinkibility is good but the rich flavor will probably limit how many one can down in a single sitting.

10099,2093,Spider889,4.41,"One of my favorite Dogfish Head beers, the 90 minute IPA packs a punch on many levels. At 9% abv it can feel a tad strong for those not accustomed to IPAs. My wife and friends do not like this beer much.  Despite the higher abv than the 60 minute, the 90 minute has a much larger, more complex flavor profile. The aroma is possibly the best feature of this brew. Very sweet and flowery, almost of lemon, chamomile, and honey with very strong hop overtones.  It pours well with minimal head. A nice light amber color, slightly darker than the 60 minute. The flavor is certainly hoppy, but the grapefruit sweetness is very noticeable and leaves an interesting after taste that one does not experience with the 60 minute.  This is also a beer that can be found in bottles at an increasingly larger number of locations (I am in OH). Giant Eagle seems to always have this and the 60 minute any more.

A very hoppy, but extremely well balanced beer. Goes down almost creamy but leaves an exceptional bitter aftertaste. The hops arent extreme but they are certainly present.

I've had the 60 Minute a number of times before but this was my first experience with 90 Minute.  Appearance- Comes off the tap a deep amber-bronze with a lot of beading carbonation throughout the body but only a slight cap of fizzy off-white head that dies back almost immediately to a very thin ring.  Smell- Fresh piney hops initially but followed closely but a strong presence of caramel maltiness. I had heard this was sweet for a DIPA, but I still wasn't prepared for the amount of malt that came through even on the nose.  Taste- Again, starts out with a strong and bitter punch of piney hops. However, what strikes me with this beer is the level of evident balancing malt sweetness. Lots of sweet caramel coming through again on the palate towards the finish and does a lot to balance out the hops.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Oddly, despite the lack of substantial head on this beer when it came out, the carbonation in the body of the beer seemed a bit prickly, which made the mouthfeel seem a touch thin. Drinkability was pretty decent but I found the sweetness to cut in on it a bit.  Overall, a solid DIPA but not one of my favorites. If you are into a detectable balancing sweetness and pine over fruit flavors in your IPA/DIPA, then this would probably be right up your alley.

Toffee, brown sugar and molasses, oh my. Much to my surprise, this 'imperial IPA' turns out to be a real malt bomb (after my experience with Burton Baton, maybe I shouldn't be so surprised). There's a decent level of citrusy bitterness fighting for attention, but it's drowned out by a load of sticky sweetness. The hops simply aren't given a chance to shine. Medium-bodied without sufficient carbonation to pry loose the sweetness from the palate.  Overall impression: Disappointing take on the style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Taste is relatively sweet, brandy like with a bitter hoppy backdrop. Very palatable beer, carbonation just managing to break through all that syrupy sweetness. The bottle was a little old and thus a little less hoppy, which I liked. One of the best Imperial IPA I've had, thanks again Jeff.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,chickenflea,4.67,Big aroma with citrus and candied dates.  A beautiful medium clear amber color with a pillowy white head that completely fails to smother the wonderful aroma.  The taste is perfect for an American ipa. Balanced sweet malts with pronounced American hops.  The texture of the beer is medium-heavy with enough substance to encourage meditation.  Great finish with no unpleasant side notes.  Ridiculously drinkable. A real pleasure.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,dropout86,4.33,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass.  A: Ruby amber, with burnt orange highlights. Slightly hazy from the amount of hops in there. Poured a 3 finger head of slightly off-white color with tight bubble retention. Beautiful lacing down the glass.  S: Luscious caramel malt, honey, dried fruit, perfumed with hops and a hint of oakiness?  T: Initial splash is sweet malt, floral hops followed by slightly fruit, citrusy hops and a quick, bitter bite. A decent amount of toasted caramel malt, dried fruit and honey. This beer finishes off with a warm, honey-sweet alcohol taste. Luxurious!  This brew is waaay sweeter than I expected and the complex layering of hops is astounding. You would think they brewed this with 4-5 different kinds of hops - maybe they did. But the real beauty here is the malt just frames the hops without overpowering them.  M: Very well carbonated for a 9% abv beer.  D: If I had the tolerance and money I would buy this with every opportunity I could.  If you have the chance to drink this beer DON'T MISS IT!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,pmccallum86,3.34,"Pours a deep amber gold color with a thick bubbly head that lingers for quite some time. Bubbles seem to rise from the bottom in perpetuity.  Smell is nothing like a typical IIPA. Very malty in aroma, with some hops coming through ever so slightly.  Taste is of sweet caramel and bready malts. Some grapefruit hops coming through as well. Alcohol is also detectable, this might be the most malty IIPA I have ever encountered. Interesting beer, worth trying but by no means a hop bomb.  Mouthfeel is thicker for an IIPA, medium/high carbonation with a big finish.  Drinkability is decent, probably won't be seeking out this beer again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The most recent time was a couple nights ago at Stone Brewery. For some odd reason, I don't know if it was that particular batch... But it wasn't anything like I remembered. It looked nice the small 8 oz. tulip glass they served it in. A little bit of head, smelled awesome. The taste just didn't do it for me this time. What I remember it to be all those previous times I've had it was awesome. I rated it as one of my faves. Unfortunately, it didn't do me any good this last time.

Clean finish.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,AgentZero,3.75,"A - Nice reddish orange IPA color with a decent head and a bit of lacing.  S - Sweeter than I was expecting, a lot of carmel malts with the hoppyness coming in. A tough citrus, a little pine, but mostly floral hops.  T - Sweet and creamy tasting with some nice hops. Quite a bit sweeter than I would have liked, but not so overpowering that it detracts from the hoppyness of the IPA. Even get a nice vanilla taste on this one.  M - A bit too creamy for me, but not horribly bad, I like my IPAs to be a little lighter with more bite.  D - Highly drinkable for 9%, I threw back two before I realized how high the ABV was.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,OlRasputin989,4.52,"Poured into a snifter...  A: pours a reddish orange with good clarity, and a large off white head which I honestly didn't expect given the high ABV. Leaves good loops and arches of lacing and good head retention  S: mmm..sweetness. cherries, and tropical fruits, cedar, toast, honey, and rich caramel.  T: rich and sweet honey and caramel malt up front, blended well with grapefruit and grapefruit peel, tropical fruits, cherry, and a toasty, woody character. Finishes with caramel sweetness, grapefruit peel, black cherry, and alcohol.  M: smooth and creamy, much more so than one would expect from an IPA(in a good way). leaves a thin, oily layer on the cheek and tongue. still finishes sharp and off-dry with a wonderful acidic hop tingle and warming effect from alcohol.  Overall, a four pack is worth every bit of 14 dollars. This may very well be the best IIPA i've had the pleasure of trying.

10099,2093,BeerThursdays,4.2,"Got a keg of this on tap in my basement. Poured into a standard pint glass. Comes out of the tap a nice hazy copper color with a big cram colored head that tins out very nicely. Lots of lacing on the glass, it's like one of those commercials. You can see each time you take a sip. Tons going on in the nose. Expected citrus/pineapple hoppy smell goes along with the grassy/bitter smells.  Taste is where this one really shines. Amazing bitter flavor up front gives way to toffee and other sweet flavors. Finishes very clean with a lasting bitter aftertaste. Not bad in any way, but lasting. It's almost sticky in the mouth, body closer to a porter than a normal IPA, and not overly carbonated.  As for drinkability, like I said, this one is on tap in the basement. I have it at least three days a week. It's what I measure all other IPA's up against. I've had better, but this one is definitely top notch.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S: honey, grapefruit, sweet and citrusy  T: up front is amazing honey malt just like the nose only bolder and rich. Powerful hop presence comes through next, very citrusy. Finish has some noticeable alcohol burn, especially as it warms. I was impressed most by the balance in this big brew. The hops are big but the sweetness is just as large.  M: smooth, creamy, not as carbonated as anticipated  D: uh, this one is really strong. I'm content with just one, and it's drinkable at that.

Rated as one of the best brews in the U.S., so I'm expecting a lot here. Pours a cloudy orange/amber with a ring of eggshell white head and stringy lace on the pint glass. Smell and taste are cedar needles, citrus zest, orange peel, sweet and toasty caramel malt, tangerine, and bitter hops. Grapefruit on the nose but not in the flavour. A bit woody as well. The alcohol is more prominent than I anticipated. Creamy and smooth mouthfeel, somewhat syrupy, great bite from the hops, sticky and dry finish is surprisingly balanced. An east coast DIPA in the truest sense of the term, as the IBUs are kept in check by a strong malt presence. Great beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The aroma of this beer just drips delicious. It screams pineapple, has big citus and pine, drips with oily, sticky resin, and that's just the hops. There is a sweet, sticky-bun character to it, big sweet malts, and yummy caramels. The taste doesn't disappoint. Big hops up front, bitter and resiny, tempered by a chewy feel, and sweet and solid malts. There is no alcohol heat, but the alcohol is there. Halfway through my serving, and I'm feeling it.

Caramel in the malt and a little bit of nut, with a piney strong hop aroma.  T- Caramel in the malt, with some light esters. A spicy and piney hop in back. This IPA has some buscuity caramel malt going on that most IPAs will not give.  M- A nice body with a moderate carbonation. The thicker more complex malts make this more interesting on the tongue.  D- An IPA that is more robust in overall flavor then most. The malt/hop combonation makes this one harder to drink then a stone. more complex, more taste, and harder to drink in a session.

Great earthly citrus hops with fruits of all kinds. Tangerine, raison and maby white grapes. Once again the alcohol becomes very noticable as it warms.  M- Full bodied that overall is really smooth.

A: Dark honey; it poured with a thick creamy lace that stayed there there entire time. S: Strong pine/juniper berry hops and peach with caramelized malts in the background. The soft fruit aroma is a nice touch. T: The sweet malts and peach stay on the tip of the tongue while the pine and spearmint linger in the back. M: Creamy and frothy; not thin, but almost syrupy.

T- Generous bitterness upfront is almost immediately counteracted by a sweet malt. A little yeasty, with a sweet fruit taste of figs, raisins, pineapple, and gourmet sugar.  M- So silky and smooth.

T - Good taste. There is a strong taste of hops, but it isn't overpowering. You also get bits of honey and some fruit. But none of this is overpowering.  M - It feels great in the mouth. With each swallow you get just the right amount of aftertaste to make you long for the next sip.  D - This drink is awesome. You could have a couple before the alcohol hits you. Very drinkable.

The taste up front is floral hops and malt with a noticeable carmel flavor. The sweetness of the malt is offset by the tangy citrus hop flavor. This is a well balanced easy to drink beer. The tanginess made me want to drink quicker than I knew I should. Each sip begging for another. The 9% ABV does not clobber your taste buds, but it will creep up on you.

A: Poured a medium yellowish-orange with a red tint, formed a relatively small head about 3-4 cm thick. Excellent carbonation.  S: Absolutely wonderful (I almost felt like I NEEDED to smell something this good): citrus, earth, raisin, all meshed nicely together.  T: Similar to the scent, earthy with hints of citrus and raisin. The high-ABV is almost comforting and warming on a cold Sunday night in February. A perfect winter imperial IPA.  M: Evenly carbonated, but not enough that it stung or overpowered my tongue.  D: I wish I wasn't a poor student and could afford more!

Streams of bubbles from the apex of the tulip. Patches of lace here and there. 4.0  S - Very sweet pale malts, caramel in small quantities mixed with citrus (lemon zest and grapefruit). Light bittering properties but much sweeter than I remembered. Spicy alcohol wafts through and brings out a bit of warmth in the nose. 4.5  T - Initial sweet maltiness of caramel and biscuits remain and complement the earthy and citrusy hop tones. Alcohol is relatively well hidden but creeps up in the finish. 4.0  M - rich body, very smooth and mildly carbonated. Juice and saliva-inducing sweet/citrusiness. 4.5  D - excellent. Another please? 4.5  Overall - since developing a taste for IPA's I can appreciate this a bit more. It's a malt bomb of a DIPA but still deliciously and juicily hoppy. Bitterness is short lived, balanced by rich malts. Served at room temperature.  --- Review on 6/1/08, 4.5/4.5/4.5/4/3.5  A - poured clear golden amber with 1"" fluffy white head in my pint glass. No lacing.  S - intense tang and citrus! Very hoppy, mild lemongrass and a slight sour tone detected. Very good.  T - Hop supreme!! Fresh grassy hops, nuttiness, and a somewhat bitter coffee-ish aftertaste. Sweet malts throughout. Light alcohol kick. Floral.  M - medium bodied, medium carbonation  D - although I could enjoy many of these in an evening, this is a beer I'd prefer to enjoy for a while  Overall - I must say that this brew is most interesting. A very good imperial IPA, comparable to the Hopdevil but with a much higher alcohol content and a stronger taste, more so in the maltiness. This brew might be even a little too strong for everyday drinking, plus it's a little pricey at $3 per bottle but I would definitely buy it again.

T: I wondered what all the fuss was about this one. Now I know. Probably one of the most balanced brews I've ever had. Massive hop attack on the tongue, along with pineapple and citrus, and even a hint of brown sugar and caramel at the near perfect finish.  M: Less than moderate carbonation, but that doesn't detract from the amazing balance of this brew. Only mild slick and oily feel, which is a bit surprising, considering the amount of hops most likely used in this beer. Still, between this one and Stone's Ruination, probably the two most balanced beers I've had so far, in the ADIPA realm.  D: I could definitely drink a few of these, but the ABV of 9% might sneak in and cause some havoc. Such a well proportioned brew that also hides the alcohol very well.

Smell: A complex array of aromas; it's hard to truly break it down. Toasty malt and a huge dose of dank hops.  Taste: A full spectrum of flavor from start to finish. Sweet, slightly toasty malt fades into hops that present a dark flavor. Citrus is prominent with a slight sweetness of peaches. Ends mildly with an herbal bitterness with hints of tobacco.  Full body with carbonation to match. Leaves a slight oily residue after the sip.  A solid beer, but certainly not my favorite DIPA.

A fair amount of sticky lacing lines the glass. Has a nice amber color to it.  S: Lots going on here. Sweet citrus aromas are of course apparent: pineapple, grapefruit, and a little orange. Pine, flowers, and freshly cut grass are also in there. I also smell some feint maltiness and a little alcohol.  T: A little citric sweetness up front (but surprisingly little when compared to other flavors). Molasses, toffee, and dark cherries and raisins soaked in brandy contribute to a very sweet and malty middle. Some pine comes through in the end as each sip finishes with a bitter hop bite. Alcohol is also fairly apparent. This tastes more like a barelywine than a DIPA to me.  M: Medium feel with a good amount of warming from the 9% abv.  D: As I noted above, this seems more like a barleywine than DIPA in taste. The malt is just as, if not more, prominent than the hops in this quaff. It's an interesting and complex brew for sure, but I'm not totally into it. IMHO there's just a little too much booze and malt sweetness in the flavor for a DIPA.

Crystal clear with a good bit of carbonation present.  Smells of grapefruit and pine, with some grassy hop aroma, and with a well-rounded, sweet malt balance. Tastes of some pine and more planty/grassy hops at first, but this gives way to a very malty backbone, with some licorice and doughy flavors. It is very bitter throughout, but the malt adds a good balancing sweetness.  Pretty heavy body and mouthfeel from all of the malt and the bitterness of the hops. The alcohol adds a bit of warmth, but is mostly hidden from the taste.  Excellent beer, great as an exemplary DIPA, showcasing the malts almost equally to the hops.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,jimmyvegas,5,Poured from a 12oz bottle. Based on the bottled date about 4 months old.  Pours a beautiful golden color with light head.  Drinks very smooth and the alcohol is not very noticable for a 9% abv brew.  Slightly sweet taste with citrus and honey flavors. Great hop flavor.  Well balanced and very drinkable. Great well rounded beer. Much better than the 60 minute and not overly sweet like the 120 minute. To me this is the best DFH IPA.  My favorite IPA of all brewers and one of my top ten beers of all time.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,hooliganlife,3.93,"pours a bright copper, quite clear, creamy head and excellent retention. light lacing  up front, it was floral with light citrus notes, mainly grapefruit and light tangerine.  the hops seem to be rather balanced with a huge malt profile. light citrus and light pine flavors. little bits of pineapple and some tangerine mixed in. a heavy bread and biscuit flavor really hold this down. the booze is there for sure. hoppy finish and aftertaste.  very thick, a bit syrupy and chewy. moderate carbonation.  a good DIPA. IMO, the malts are too heavy and take away from the hops. this was one of the first DIPA's i had although i am not sure why i never reviewed it. given the high ABV, maybe one at a time but i do enjoy them from time to time.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Chico1985,4.2,"Update, 11/15/10 - After having a 4-pack more recently I brought down the taste score from 4.5 to 4. It's a little too sweet and boozy for my tastes now, but I still definitely enjoy this beer.  Original review: One of the first beers I ever had that really ""blew me away"". I've had a ton of these but this is my first in 4 or 5 months. Pours dark orange, nice fluffy white head. Turns into a thick ring around the edge of the glass. Ah, that great grapefruit/citrus smell I remember so well. Still tastes as great as I remember. Caramel, grapefruit, heavy perfumey sweetness, slight tropical fruit (pineapple), resin. Unfortunately a little alcohol bite turns into alot over time and kind of drags down the great taste, shame. Mouthfeel however otherwise is perfect, very smooth and oily, works great here. Drinkability suffers a bit because of the alcohol bite and heaviness. Not many double IPA's grab my attention (I've always preferred regular IPA's) but this one does. A classic.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,mattmcmanus,4.52,"This beer is exceptional and without a doubt one of my favorites.  It pours beautifully with a amber glow and a fluffy thick head. The aroma my favorite part of this beer. It's full of floral notes and crisp hoppiness. The taste is complex and interesting. It has hints of the standard IPA bitterness but the profile definitely goes far beyond that into a smooth, rounded hoppy sweetness.  I've used this beer on a number of occasions to teach people how to love hoppy beers who typically avoid the bitter flavors of IPAs (my wife included!)",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,zoso493,4.69,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Foothills straight-sided pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a really nice, deep, honey-amber color with a worrying lack of a head. The color is really nice and rich, but I have my doubts as to the quality of this bottle because of the lack of head, which dissipates quickly and leaves no lacing on the glass.  Smell: This is a glorious smelling DIPA, and unique, too. It has a great hop profile of floral and citrusy hops that smell almost too sweet to be the wonderful bittering agents we know them as. There is also a huge, sweet malt scent, as well, and a really strong scent of honey. The floral hops prevail, though, and the smell leaves you dying to get a taste.  Taste: This is an extraordinarily complex IPA. It starts out with a burst of floral and fruity hops, which are then perfectly balanced by a load of malts. It finishes with a lovely bitterness that sticks around just long enough to remind you that this is a DIPA, and a damn good one at that.  Mouthfeel: This one has a great amount of body to it and is just the right thickness for a DIPA. It's also incredibly smooth and the hop bitterness is not cloying in any way, leaving the palate dry and ready for more.  Drinkability: Well, the alcohol is not so readily discernible in this brew, but at 9%, you wouldn't be able to put away a whole lot of these. If you had nothing important to do the next day, though, and some cash to spare, it would be a great pleasure to have a few of these.  Overall, this is a fantastic DIPA and I have to say that Sam C. at Dogfish Head got this one spot on. A lot of DIPA's are so highly hopped that they must be overly-compensated with malts, but this one clearly makes the hops the central focus of the beer. This is one hell of a bold and complex brew and one of the better IPA/DIPA's I've had. If you haven't had this brew, you should really get one the next time you go to the store. Great beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I really can't think of anything negative to say about this one. It's cheap for the quality and hefty 9% ABV.

10099,2093,manahansf,3.93,"Pours a hazy amber color with a thick two finger, white head. The brew has good head retention and the frothy head continues to give of the sweet malty aroma sip after sip. Although the nose is mainly malty, there is a very subtle background of floral hops and vinous characteristics. The flavor is also very malty and sweet, even a little grainy with only hints of hops and an increasingly vinous taste as the drink finishes. The end comes slowly with a mix of port and sweet malt fading to the end.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,climax,4.2,"Poured into a pint glass:  The color was a glowing amber, with a very creamy 2-3 fingers of head. The retention was excellent.  The aroma was packed with toasty biscuity malt, it had quite a bit of influence in the overall balance. Citrus and pine resin were the main flavors from the hops, which seemed a bit understated. Strong notes of cocoa, mint, caramel, and spices mingled for supremacy.  Flavor was packed with malt as well. Very toasted sweet flavors were at the forefront. Oranges, caramel, cocoa, and bubblegum created a very interesting taste that was ever-changing throughout the beer. The alcohol was pretty welll hidden for 9%. I did sample this a bit after the brew date which could have contributed to a slight lack of aggressive hoppiness.  The feel had lots of body, very creamy and smooth. Carbonation kept the feel lively as it went down. This beer isn't a brutal hop curbstomp if that's what your looking for.... but I think it hits in all the right places, and it's damn good.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,CrazyDavros,3.7,"Pours dark amber with a lasting creamy head. Aroma is a huge mix of hops and malt, with loads of resin, caramel, nutty, bready and toasty malt. I don't think this is all that fresh... But I love malty IPA's anyway. Flavour profile is huge! Caramel and toasty malt are definately at the forefront, with hop resin and grapefruit also present in large amounts. Clean alcohol makes an appearance, followed by a strong bitterness that doesnt quite manage to balance the malt. Very smooth carbonation, with quite a rich body. Perhaps too rich. Apart from the sweet malt overpowering everything else, this was pretty tasty.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

It's a very subtle aroma in that there's a lot of sweetness but it's not overwhelming one bit.  Taste is syrupy, smooth. Reminiscent of nugget nectar, but not as in your face.

S: Not too strong, mostly a mild citrusy, slightly grassy hop smell, but with some sweetness probably due to the age (about 4 months). And it's too sweet, even adjusting for age.

The hops strike first but are not allowed to dominate - the malt kicks in with a surprising sweetness with notes of caramel and honey, leading to an even finish with citrus hops, bitter notes and lively malt. The alcohol is an afterthought in a beer which crams a lot of flavor into a small package.  Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, with hints of carbonation.

10099,2093,Pahn,4.51,"12oz bottle into Duvel tulip. Bottled on 12/02/09 (so around 2 months old).  Appearance: Decently strong pour yields a 1 inch frothy head that quickly dissipates. Semi-translucent orange with bubbles rising in the middle. Continents of lacing stick around for awhile, then fade.  Smell: Floral, grassy, herbal, and citrus hops. Sweet, with lots of fruit, and some bread and alcohol notes. Deep nose that's hard to pin down, but very nice. Develops as the beer warms; starts hoppy and fruity, now it's very hot alcohol, now it's savory like Korean BBQ (!), now it's grassy and bready. I'm a sucker for beers that give me a great aroma at first, then proceed to show off entirely different but equally beautiful aromas as the night goes on.  Taste: First sip: big and bitter hit of grassy hops with sweet and varied esters popping up right away and a smooth but not very lasting malty finish. As I get deeper into the beer, a pleasant alcohol warmth builds in the chest and the malt profile displays large notes of caramel and toast. Myriad fruity esters are present in every sip, which are, like the smell, difficult (for me) to pin down and identify. The heavy IBU is balanced by the depth and variety of fruit and malt flavors. Finish gradually gets rather bitter, but after the flavor assault that is the majority of each sip, I don't mind not getting the nice long bready aftertaste of some other great IPAs.  It's easy to drink this beer without thinking too much, and simply enjoy the big, obvious hops, pleasant fruitiness, and caramel/toasted rye bread malt. If that's all there was to taste, 90min would still be a great beer. However, if you sit down and savor each sip, there's just an endless depth to the flavor. Various fruits, ranging from sweet and bright to dark and musty, different bready notes, different consistencies (creamy/oily/juicy/sharp and bitter/smooth, warm bread/harsh, warm alohol), some phenolic bites, herbal and floral notes, all emerge and interact with the constantly developing aroma. I've been drinking this beer for a few years now, and I still don't feel like I ever exhaust the depth of its flavor.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and full-bodied, with rather heavy carbonation. Good vehicle for the deep taste, but more difficult to like after you've had Squall IPA (at least for me).  Drinkability: Disappears quickly, with a very sneaky ABV. 1 is enough, but you'll want more.  Like Stone's Arrogant Bastard, DFH 90min IPA is as good as you'd expect the flagship beer of a premier American craft brewery to be (ie excellent). It's a bit... brash, at least in comparison to Squall IPA, which is my only real criticism (a somewhat half-hearted criticism to be honest). The flavors and aroma are bold and exquisite. A classic beer that should be tried by everyone who even remotely likes beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The head recedes into a patchy layer on top leaving solid lacing.  Smells of sweet caramel malts with solid amounts of citrus and pine hops. As it warms the hop aromas take on slightly floral notes. Not a far cry from a moderately-hopped small barleywine.  Tastes similar to how it smells, though not quite as large. Caramel malt flavors kick things off and are met quickly by equal amounts of hop flavors - mostly citrus but with hints of pine. Both flavors carry equal weight through to a mildly bitter ending.  Mouthfeel is good. It's got a solid thickness with moderate carbonation.  Drinkability is good. I finished my glass without a problem and could have another.

10099,2093,Minotaur,4.55,"The beer lives up to its extensive reviews and reputation. Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. It is an initially slightly hazed, but quickly clearing golden-copper with deep red shadows. The head is a frothy white two finger head that reduces to a slight skim and ring. The lacing hangs to the sides of the glass in streaks.  The aroma is a musty pine with notes of tangerine and grapefruit. It is not overwhelmingly sweet but instead nutty and rich, earthy.  The taste ranks up there with the other big DIPAs in terms of complexity. There are layers of earth - almost woodsy notes, nuts, a hint of malt sweetness, and floral bitterness. I am reminded of a pine forest, wildflowers, and an overlay of mild orange-tangerine. The bitterness is there but extremely well-balanced with the wine-whiskey alcohol flavor and slight berry-like finish.  The mouthfeel is quite carbonated and liquor-like. It is not quite as creamy as the heavy taste would seem to lead up to in expectation.  It is a very drinkable beer despite the depth and heavy alcohol presence.

Taste: It's unbelievable how smooth this beer is considering the hop count and ABV; incredibly smooth for 9%, not hot at all. The caramel of the malt really comes through. Aftertaste on the back of the tongue is pleasantly alcoholic and full of more hops. Really delicious. This is one of the better tasting, most balanced IPA's.  Mouthfeel: Low carbonation, but not inappropriately so. Thinner than some ales I've had, wish it were a little heavier on the palate to be honest.  Drinkablity: Surprisingly high, perhaps because it isn't all that heavy. No sign of palate fatigue.

There are elements and characteristics of the hops that this technique brings out... and the balance that they achieved deserves a hug and a kiss from everybody they meet.  A: Golden orange amber. The way it poured into my (wine) glass reminded me of the way a steady stream ripples over the larger, smooth rocks near the shore. There seems to be a dim light source from within the glass... seriously... it looks like the way sunlight is depicted when it is refracted off of wheat fields from an artists perspective... making sense?? Van Gogh would paint this beer if he were alive today.  S: Surprisingly, the caramel from the barley is the main bouquet here. I smell a little fresh wheat (sorry to use that comparison again), and some mild citrus. I am intrigued by how un-hoppy it smells... I always appreciate a beer that has balance, not matter the machismo amount of hops added... and when I smell this I am pleased.  T: It is truly amazing... I was expecting a hop rush when I bought this bottle, but like I mentioned I have little patience for beers that can't achieve balance (of course there are exceptions). The main flavors are the caramel malts and the citrus from the hops gently round out the taste. My tongue is left with an oaky, residue that lingers and the hops open up within that aftertaste context. Also some nut and oatey tastes come out as you drink on.  M: A rich creamy texture... the malt shines in the initial mouthfeel... then what I am assuming to be the complexity of oils from the hops both pull and coat the tongue... very unique.

Lots of sweet caramel maltiness and a great hoppy finish make this a great overall DIPA. More malt than hoppiness for sure. Its somewhat sweet but not too much so.  Smooth mouthfeel. Not high in carbonation- slightly syrupy and mouthcoating. Goes down smooth and leaves you wanting more.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,rfabian,4.03,Poured into a tumbler it produces a quarter-inch head that leaves solid lacing. The appearance is amber and clear. The aroma is of mouth watering citrus hops and strong roasted malts. The taste is moderately bitter with hops and there is much maltiness. The feel is medium bodied and the finish alcoholic. There is nice alcoholic warmth. This is a very nice and enjoyable strong ale.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Clear, copper brew.  s- pronounced raspberry/rose/pine hops, slightly malty, hints of fried rice  t- strong hops balanced w/ plenty of somewhat caramelized malt; aftertaste bitterweet, hoppy  m- light to medium bodied, slightly oily, w tingly carbonation nicely lasting to the finish.

10099,2093,DrinkingAleToday,4.35,"A: Pours a golden orange with a slight head that kicks up witha swirl of the glass.  S: Citrus fruit and resinous pine combine nicely with the aroma of carmel, biscuit, and toffee.  T: The malt and hops accent each other perfectly, however the hops easily win in the end, hop flavor in the form of citrus fruit and dank earthy pine, bitter but not overwhelming, more hop flavor than bitterness, nice malty sweetness.  M: Oh so smooth, carbonation tickles the tounge, medium to full bodied, reminds me of bottle conditioned ales.  D: All around delicious and drinkable, not as bitter as other DIPA's, perfectly balanced and dangerous at 9%.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Beerandraiderfan,3.36,"A decent looking beer. Pours like a stronger than average IPA, a little darker than expected. Aroma, more earth grainy feel than hops.  Taste, much sweeter than I even expected in my skewed idea of what DFH brings to the table. I liked it, don't get me wrong, but geez, $10 a 4 pack for this? Tastes more like old English barleywine poured into an IPA. Don't see the hoppy pine descriptions I hear about. Very malt heavy, which might hide some of it. Mouthfeel and drinkability suffer, as you just expect more from a beer advertised as such.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,nickd717,4.13,"12oz bottle, picked up from the corner store and brought to a house party. This is one of the most reviewed beers on the site, so it wouldn't feel right if I didn't throw in my 2 cents on it.  Pours a clear copper color with a nicely formed white head and some lacing. Looks great.  Nice piney hop aroma, along with some woody/earthy notes and malty sweetness.  Citrusy, piney, fresh-tasting east coast hops on the flavor balanced by sweet malt. More malt-forward than most of the good west coast IPAs, which knocks this down a peg in my book, but it's still very good. Some interesting earthy notes in there, which works well.  Medium-full bodied with a really smooth palate and a little bit of lingering hop bitterness. Mildly syrupy.  Extremely drinkable given the style and ABV. This really is a nice beer and catches a lot of unwarranted flack out here in CA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,cavedave,3.94,"NOTE: This is from a growler, and therefore from a keg. I have enjoyed this beer in bottles for years, but this is the first growler, and it is unlike my previous, and unreviewed, experiences with DFH 90.  It pours a clear and thick looking dark amber. No head to speak of from the growler, just a ring and bubbles rising.  It is a fairly light, but highly penetrating, aroma of pine, citrus, earth, and neutral grains. Very appealing.  East coast IIPA all the way, baby, that's what this is. Plenty of flavor, plenty of balance, clean as a whistle. It starts with a full flavored push of dark sugar, pine, subtle yeasty notes, and finishes a c-hair short of dry, with a long, tasty, bitter, citrus rind, herbal resinance (not a misspelling). The balance of these flavors make this a wonderful drink.  Mouthfeel, even from the bottles, has always been an issue, and from this growler it continues to be. Though it is light in the mouth and fairly creamy, it is too resinous for the amount of hops, and the amount of alcohol. Carbonation from this growler is perfect, low, but enough to brighten the sip. The finish is very good, but could be better is what I'm saying.  Drinkability is quite good, it is refreshing, interesting, and delicious.  Impression: Looking for an unbalanced, hop atomic bomb? Not for you. Looking for a wimpy no flavor IIPA? Not for you. Looking for a full flavored and balanced very brightly hopped IIPA? Get a growler of this fersure.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,jamiesessions,4.45,"A clear golden-orange pour with a tiny white head that laces my glass nicely. Smells of hops quite strongly at first. Citrusy smells pervade my nostrils, oranges and grapefruits enter, but wait. what's that bringing up the rear. It's a beautiful bouquet of caramel, here to balance out the instant hop-death I'm preparing myself for. I taste it, and while those same hops are certainly present, the caramel does a wonderful job of balancing out that hop attack for a very smooth and balanced taste that I wasn't expecting out of a DIPA. Carbonation is a bit high, and the alcohol is definitely quite noticeable, but what do you expect with a 9% abv beer? This a delicious little brew that gets my wholehearted seal of approval",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Lunch,4.08,"Served from a 12oz. bottle (12/02/09 date stamped) purchased at the Perfect Pour in Columbia, Maryland into my Dogfish Head snifter at the appropriate temperature (01/07/10).  A: Pours a beautiful glowing golden amber with a deep copper hue capped off with one finger of a creamy yet frothy off-white head. The head dissipated into a nice skin and collar leaving some patchy lacing.  S: I was a little a surprised that a bottle about 4 weeks old had lost quite a bit of its hop aroma. Some citrus and piney hops along with a dominant caramel malt. At first the malt smelled slightly burnt, but as the beer warmed the burnt tone diminished leaving a much more citrusy aroma.  T: A piney hop starts the flavor profile off followed quickly by and sweet caramel malt with some citrus undertones. This is certainly not the best 90Min I have had, but it certainly improved as it warmed. More citrus tones came out and the burnt flavor went away.  M: Fuller-bodied and quite creamy with smooth carbonation.  D: The 9% abv. only slight shows itself in a slight warming tone in the finish, but overall this is a fairly easy drinking beer, especially on-tap.  Overall this has been one of my favorite DIPAs over the years and perhaps my first ever. Unfortunately, this beer seems to be quite inconsistent regarding its flavor profile. Highly recommended on-tap and just recommended out of the bottle.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,BabyBastard,3.5,"Considering how much of this brew I have consumed over the past twelve months, it may be time for a review. Pours out of the bottle a nice dark amber color with a big, white foamy head that tends to sink down shortly. Best lacing that I have seen on a beer in a long time. Smell is a strong, malty nose, with citrus notes hidden in there somewhere. Very malty for an imperial IPA, but I see no complaints in this section. Batch was bottled on 11-5-09, may explain the superb malt smell. Taste is very similar to the smell, a very subdued hop character lingers in the background. Surely it does not taste like your typical imperial IPA. This is in no way a negative attribute, in my opinion. Feels great at first sip, very smooth and easy to drink. Almost too easy to drink, due to the high alcohol content. This is one of my ""go to"" beers, being an excellent value and very good in the taste and smell department.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,camcroteau,4.15,90min was a very good beer. I thought it was lacking in the hops department for an imperial ipa. It pours well with great lacing. I liked how smooth a finish it has. Overall this beer was very good but as a hop head I crave a much hoppier beer. I would recommend to someone who likes mild hops but for hop head i recommend hopslam.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S - Strong hop and barley w/ distinct hints of citrus (orange).  T - Strong hops with nice hints of citrus.  M - Smooth and sometimes slightly bitter beer with just the right amount of carbonation.  D - Slightly bitter to this reviewer with the first few sips, but the beer grows on you the more you drink it. Love the beer.

S: Wonderful full smell of brown sugar, malt, pine, with a hint of lemon citrus.  T: Ingredients are perfectly balanced as the carbonation doesn't overwhelm the deep flavors of malt and some fruitiness. It's very full and very smooth. Bitter but welcome aftertaste lingers for 30 seconds or so.  M: Perfect balance of hops and carbonation.  D: Would have another, but not more than two.

10099,2093,DoctorStrangiato,4.72,"Poured a 355-ml bottle into a cognac glass.  Appearance - beautiful copper-amber colour with an off-white, short-lived head. A ring around the edge remains as does the thinnest of surface bubbles. Majestic lacing throughout even with such little head to work with.  Smell - tonnes of fresh hops jumping out over soft malt. Deep citrus aromas as well as a subtle pine bark influence.  Taste - deep, onward rolling layers of malt pushing back and forth against a steady bitterness. The lengthy finish of the hops carries on the malt flavours well past what would be expected. You can still taste the fullness of this brew over a minute after drinking. Very good.  Mouthfeel - the right amount of activeness from the hops and carbonation. Perfect balance.  Drinkability - would someone have more than one of these at a time? I never have.

10099,2093,birchstick,4.65,"A - pours a very light copper/darker yellow color with a 1.5 finger head that is very porous. You can tell it is loaded with hops just by looking at it.  S - who would have thought an Imperial IPA would have smelt like a ton of hops? Very piney with a touch of citrus (grapefruit primarily). There is also a toasted malt present and a smell of burnt biscuits.  T - Starts off with some bitter, piney hops. The hops are balanced on the finish by some sweet caramel/toffee and toasted malts - this beer is extremely well-balanced. There is also a bit of pepper throughout the middle of the flavors. The final flavors I am left with is grapefruit, thanks to the hops, that is blended together with caramel malt. I gave this a 5 because I can't imagine a more well-balanced Imperial anything (and because it tastes really really good).  M - very smooth and full; goes down nicely. I also wouldn't have had any idea that this is 9% - the abv is very well masked.  D - Being that this is an Imperial IPA, I found this to be amazingly drinkable compared to others in this style. The malt balance might have helped this for me. This beer held my interest throughout, and I enjoyed it very much. I am glad I finally got my hands on some fresh ones - I have passed this beer up many times due to it sitting on shelves for a while. I can see why this is one the most-rated beers on this website.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Ghenna,4.33,"I have to admit, the moniker of Imperial IPA has scared me away from this beer since I first saw it at the local bevmo. Reason being that I've had regular IPAs that have totally killed my malt loving palate. Feeling adventurous I figured I'd give it a shot and, if nothing else, finish it after I had already had a few more beers (and would no longer be as concerned with things like taste).  Truthfully, I have been pleasantly surprised by this brew. It pours almost copper with a serious head that leaves rings of lacing till you hit the bottom of the glass. Plenty of malt and hop in the nose, but well balanced- I don't feel as if I am sniffing a bouquet of citrusy pine needles. The taste further highlights the perfect balance of strong hop and sweet malt. I thoroughly have enjoyed this beer, not only for the initial taste, but for the change of character over this last 45 minutes. As it has warmed, the malt profile has made itself more evident- much to my great pleasure.  I really lucked out finding two singles of this at World Market in their singles section- so it was like a buck sixty per bottle. Totally worth that- if not the regular price.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Heaps of resiny, piny american hops. Great stuff.  This is an old bottle, so with that considered - very malty taste for an IIPA. For me, it is probably too balanced. The hops dont win - they are balanced very well against the malt. That being said both are delicious, and most of the good reviewers have more accurately described what I am tasting. An exceptional beer.  Feels great in the mouth. I can't wait to try this fresh.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Smell - Very Malty smell right off the bat. I pick up a bit of citrus too, but malt and barely are the strongest smells coming through.  Taste - Right away I get malt and it finishes nicely with citrus and hop flavor. Very malty for an IPA, but pulled off very well.  Mouthfeel - The beer is carbonated well, and has a good amount of thickness for an imperial IPA without going overboard.

There is a floral hop taste midway through which is a nice balance. It isn't a hop bomb like the 60 minute more smooth. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with very little carbonation.

Sweet malt aroma that is very pleasant with a nice touch of floral hops and hints of caramel.  Taste mimicks the nose quite well beginning with a nice malt sweetness explosion upfront. This brew is lightly nutty, a bit bready, and is balanced perfectly by the hop bitterness that builds to punch and lingers well after the swallow. A nice alcohol warming sensation is also noticeable at the tail end of the swallow. Sweet and bitter without being to heavily slanted towards either side.  The mouthfeel is quite perfect for this brew. Its heavy on the palate, creamy, and mouth enveloping given its medium/high carbonation.  Each sip is packed with flavor and is delightful.

Smells like perfumey, citrus (grapefruit) hops with some sweet caramel and bready malt.  Taste is an assault on the taste buds. The bitterness reigns supreme, but the best part of this beer is that the malt, while overshadowed, is still there and makes itself very known. A nice caramel base lets the hops run wild.  Nice body and aggressive, tickly carb.  Obviously this isn't a sessionable beer. It doesn't go down fast. But every sip is a reward and drinkability is one of its strong suits.

10099,2093,nickfl,4.48,"A - Pours with two fingers of very light brown foam that settles slowly and leaves very nice lace. The body is a beautiful, dark copper color with excellent clarity. This is one of those very rare beers that really impresses with its looks.  S - A nice, green aroma of citrus and pine hops with some mint and basil notes. A good dose of backing malt as well with sugary aromas of toast and carmel.  T - Lots of dense malt up front, carmel, brown sugar, and toffee. The hops quickly kick in as well with lots of pine and sweet (perhaps red) grapefruit. More toast in the middle with increasing sweetness and the beginnings of the hop bitterness. Finishes with lots of juicy hop flavor and increasing candy sugar like sweetness. The bitterness is capable of balancing the substantial malt, but only just barely. Lingering sweet orange hop character blends nicely with the toasty malt in the aftertaste.  M - Medium-thick body, moderate carbonation, and a sweet finish.  D - This is a really classic DIPA and I realize as I drink this bottle that it has been far too long since I had one. The hop intensity is really substantial; bold enough to stand with such classics as Two Hearted, and quite reminiscent of that beer in particular. Despite the big hops, the malt manages to dominate the beer with huge, but never cloying, quantities of toast and brown sugar. The highlight of the beer is, appropriately enough, in the long, lingering aftertaste and takes the form of a sweet, orange-caramel hop note that coats the mouth but never become old or offensive.

A - Crystal clear amber. A vigorous pour results in minimal off white head that does leave a gorgeous lacing. The head recedes to leave a nice cap in its wake. Tiny bubbles float up form the bottom of the glass.  S - Wow, that's a lot of malt and hops! Caramel, honey, citrus and pine crash into my nose like a robber into a telephone pole on some SPIKE TV reality show. There's a lot of smells going on here, and lot of each smell. Maybe that's the point. Copious amounts of good things.  T - Here's where it all goes to shit...on opposite day! I'm almost at a loss for words this is so well balanced. All the flavours are huge, but none really takes the lead. The citrus and pine form the hops is all over my palate, but being tamed by a gorgeous bready, caramel and honey flavour. I love it! Bitterness creeps in on the back of the palate but it's tamed by a warmth from the alcohol and more sweetness from the malts. It finishes both bitter and sweet at once if that's possible. This is a beer built on contrasts, and it does it extremely well. As it warms all these contrasts become more noticeable. What a great thing.  M - Medium bodied with a nice slick feel to it. Just enough carbonation to prickle the tongue and wake up those taste buds.  D - Damn, this stuff is dangerous. I could down these so easily all night. The LCBO needs to get this ASAP. I'm not sure I can live without it.  Notes: Really, this is the kind of beer that will get wine drinkers (other than lambics and RIS's).

10099,2093,Daniellobo,4,"Nice draft serving of an iconic DIPA, unfortunately a bit too cold to feel its full richness on this occasion.  Presentation: 10 oz draft serving at a Dogfish Head Ale House. Menu has a small and fair description of the brew. Shows Alc. by Vol. (9%) Served in a snifter.  A - Medium amber with a short foamy head touching the rim of the snifter, and leaving rich lacing and a solid top layer.  S - Hoppy nose, pine, resin and grapefruit and a ranging sweet malt insinuation. There is a conflicted sense of draft freshness with a surprising subdued nose.  T - Resin and citrus coating a fresh sweetness and bringing back the assertive but soft profile.  M - Medium body with an assertive presence. Great mouthfeel, and small and balanced carbonation.  D - Deceptively drinkable for such a brew. This serving on the snifter sends a strange message asking for a slow enjoyment but with too cold, and quaffable a profile.  Notes: Remains a personal classic and a great draft serving but this one today... In general I´m finding they have the brews too cold for my liking at the ale house this time. In fact I´m not even sure I enjoy the snifter for this brew, I´d probably prefer it on a nice tulip glass, or an oversized snifter if anything.

Appearance: A lovely golden color, with a 1 finger puffy white head. Fair lacing.  Smell: Oh baby. The first thing to hit me is a delicious bready smell. That's followed by some tropical citrus hops with some floral notes in there. It's strong and mouth-watering. Outstanding.  Taste: This is absolutely a world-class beer. It starts with a kick of tropical fruit with a generous helping of honey. Then the terrific hops kick in. The hops are bitter citrus and pungent pine, with a bit of booze in the finish. Goodness gracious.  Mouthfeel: Lively and smooth as hell.  Drinkability/Overall: Drinkability? Let's put it this way: I wish that I had tastebuds all over my body so that I could bathe in this beer. I would drink this all day every day if it wasn't for, you know, the certain death that would shortly ensue. But would it be worth it? ...I'm not saying it would be, but I'm not saying it wouldn't be.  What was I talking about? Oh, yeah. This is one of my top couple of beers in the world.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I was supposd to do that, but instead I found some small Irish bar in Bath, ME with 90 minute on tap. Byrnes I think was the name, and it is possibly the only Irish bar that didn't make me want to get all stabby.  The beer was cold, hoppy as hell, and strong. It fit the day and fit the week. Thanks to the DFH.  I would have been happier with less floral hops and more bitter. When its supposed to be 90 minutes of hops, I want to walk away looking like I sucked a grapefruit.

10099,2093,EJNibs,4.27,"A: Beautiful amber-gold. Head is fairly thin and dissipates quickly.  S: The alcohol was a bit harsh in the bouquet at first, but after about 2 minutes it gave way to a luxurious notes of caramel, toffee and only a hint of hops; I must say I was surprised by the way the sweeter malt notes seemed to dominate the hops in the nose.  T: Woah. In a word, ""balance."" I was expecting a hop monster here on the order of a Bell's Hopslam or Boulder Mojo Risin', but not to be had. The hop bitterness is present but mild, and the malt is surprisingly prominent. Now on the fourth or fifth sip I'm still surprised the way the malt almost dominates the palate in this imperial IPA. Where are the hops you ask? Well, to answer that, at the risk of being uncouth, in the burps! Yes, when you burp, there are those wonderful floral hop notes.  M: Not the tongue-shredding hop monster I'd expected: the mouthfeel is smooth and fuller than most IPAs. Yeah, tasting it again, this one in a word would be smooth.  D: For an Imperial IPA? Damn. This goes down way to easy. Unless you've already set your sights under the table, the 9% might sneak up on you with this guy. The only thing that makes it slightly less drinkable is the fuller body than I'd expected probably due to the high malt content, but that's not a knock, just a note.  Verdict: I was certainly surprised by this one. As I said, I was expecting a hop monster, and found a beer that strikes an incredible balance-not only between hops and malt, but also accommodating the 9% with remarkable drinkability. Although this is a great beer, I'm reluctant to give full marks due to arguably a philosophical difference: I think Imperial IPAs should have a greater hop presence than this one does. I remember an editorial in BA Magazine not too long ago lamenting the fact that most extreme brewing was just hops hops hops and nothing else. This does, indeed, break the mold insofar as it has remarkable hop-malt balance and drinkability for an IIPA. Still, even with the balance it has, I want at least a shade or two more hops here.

S: The smell is much more of a mix of hops and citrus than our West Coast IPAs. A nice balance of citrus and pine hops along with a sweet, caramel malt backbone.  T: The hop flavor is mostly bitter grapefruit. There is also a very strong malt component that has a very roasted, yet sweet flavor. The finish is a bit of pine and some more grapefruit.  M: This is actually quite full bodied, but that's not too surprising for a double IPA. The tiny carbonation bubbles help to keep things from getting too heavy.  D: For a 9% beer, this is surprisingly lacking in the booziness department (and a welcome change from certain other DFH beers).

10099,2093,MasterSki,4.23,"This is one of my ""gateway"" beers, but recently when I've gone to the stores the bottles are all 2-5 months old. So when I got to Binny's today and saw a batch from 11/04/09 I was stoked. Served in my Kuhnhenn tulip.  A - Pours with a gorgeous 2+ fingers of light tan foam that takes forever to dissipate to a thick cap (I timed it at around 6 minutes). The lacing coats the sides of the glass. Gorgeous transparent golden amber body with a stream of tiny bubbles racing up the middle of the glass.  S - A big burst of pine and grapefruit hoppiness over a strong toasted malt and toffee backbone. Maybe a bit of sweeter citrus zest, tangerine or orange. The aroma exemplifies the prototypical East Coast balanced DIPA, with both elements of the brew complementing each other and working in tandem. There's the tiniest hint of alcohol, but nowhere near as much as when I had this beer on tap a few months ago.  T - The taste is significantly less hop forward, with a initial burst of bitter grapefruit followed by a long sustained dose of toffee and cookie dough. The finish is lightly bitter, with a bit of pine and grapefruit again popping up in the aftertaste. Alcohol is again reasonably well-hidden.  M - Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with low carbonation. Body is definitively medium, and could stand to be a touch more viscous to support the ABV. There's some definite warming, even after half a glass. Finishes very oily and resiny.  D - The only thing really preventing me from drinking large quantities of this brew is the ABV, as well as the difficulty in finding fresh bottles. I've inadvertently purchased older bottles in the past (before I knew of the date-codes), or had this from old kegs, and it gets boozy and underwhelming pretty fast. I'm not sure who's at fault, but until I can reliably find bottles less than 6 weeks old this ain't getting more than a 4.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The complex flavors slowly develop and reveal themselves: pine, citrus, fresh herbs, and tasted bread with an elegant sweetness of clover honey. As the hop oils distribute and build up in the mouth a nice prickly bitterness sets in, but the malt keeps coming through to balance the equation.

Nose: The rich, sweet, bread smell makes it's way through the heavy hops. Quite complex, and not overwhelmed by pure hops.  Tongue: This is where this brew shines. The powerful hops are balanced well with the thick malty sweetness later on. The 9% ABV is barely detectable. The flavor gets even more complex and satisfying as it warms to room temperature. The hop hit is there, but this is not purely a hop bomb as seem in many IPA's/DIPA's. The definition of character in flavor.  Mouth: Smooth as silk, a touch creamy.  Libation: Overall a fantastic offering and one of my favorites around. DIPA's tend not to be session beers, but this is as close as you will get.

10099,2093,hreb,4.3,"For my 100th beer review I'm reviewing the classic Dogfish 90. Cold 12oz bottle poured into chalice glass. Beer pours a golden amber color with nearly no head and a rich, fresh apricot/citrus-hop aroma.  The first sip is long and complex: first, sharp carbonation and bitterness followed by warming, fruity orange/lemon citrus flavors. These give way to a standard pale ale malt profile, and finally the familiar bitter bite of IPA finishes off the sip. After becoming acquanted with the glass the initial attack is less pronounced and the warm, sweet flavors of this Double really stand out.  What makes this beer not just good but great is its drinkability. Unlike 60-minute or Harpoon or a dozen others, drinking one of these doesn't leave the palate burned out -- and yet, this is a BIG, 9% beer, not some 3.5% English IPA tomfoolery. I feel like the only thing holding back this beer from unlimited drinkability is the alcohol content.

There is about a finger's worth of head that leaves a nice cap on the beer throughout and leaves decent lacing on the side of the glass.  S- A good example of an east coast IPA because it's not a huge hop bomb. Yes, the hops are present but the malt is the dominant scent. Also a little smell of some caramel and maybe even a little bit of honey.  T- This is a pretty balanced imperial. Not a whole lot of bitterness because of the good helping of malt. There is also a bit of honey in there and some other sweetness. Add in some orange and maybe even a hint of wood. For being 9% ABV, it is hidden pretty well.  M- A medium bodied brew that has a good smoothness to it and not a lot of bitterness like other IPA's. It almost seems like it is a bit on the syrupy side, maybe it's just me.  D- A decent beer but it is almost too sweet for me and the mouthfeel seems a little on the syrupy side.

10099,2093,Brenden,4.23,"The color is a golden-toned amber copper with a light haze to it. The head is dense, foamy and ever-present, dropping sheets of lacing that cling to the glass all the way down. The aroma is fresh hops with a clean citrus and a malt presence. Nearly as potent is a hint of raw sugar sweetness. This one's like drinking fresh hops juice and barley, while lingering underneath sits the sugary sweetness reminiscent of the 120 without the overwhelming presence of it. Also present is a bright citrus tone, lemon and orange rind, herbal notes and a floral taste. Alcohol doesn't show much in the flavor but packs a punch, a combination that makes for dangerous drinking. The mouthfeel has a crisp nip from a moderate carbonation and a nice rich, creaminess from the balancing malt. Body is moderate. This is a great IPA with high drinkability despite a high ABV.

One inch, beige head is creamy and stays for the entire experience, leaving very nice rings of lace around the sides of the glass.  Smell: Pineapple, pine, peach, grapefruit rind, and earth with caramel and brown sugar sweetness.  Taste: Wow. A perfectly balanced (probably overly balanced) big beer. 90 Minute has just as much malt presence as it does hop presence. First thing I notice is the smooth caramel, syrupy, brown sugar sweetness from the malt. This soon fades away, replaced by piney, citrusy, bitter hop flavors and mild alcohol in the finish. Leaves a strange, salty sensation on my lips.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, rich, thick, and juicy. Carbonation stays in the background for the most part but is present enough to make this beer drinkable, keeping it creamy rather than syrupy.  Drinkability: This brew is delicious and I want to drink a lot more but I only have four and they probably have as many calories as a frappuccino. The 9% ABV is buried well and never becomes too hot.  I'm not going to fault this beer based on the fact that it's a pretty malty and sweet DIPA, like a lot of reviewers do.

10099,2093,SkunkWorks,4.23,"Bottled 08-03-09 and poured into a pint glass (had to make use of my new Dogfish Head pint glass!)  Pours a deep, reddish amber and is a little dark for an IPA. As it pours, the carbonation seemed to go completely insane like there was a whirlpool of carbonation in my glass... I've never seen this before. The head is about an inch thick at first and dissipates into a fairly thin layer on top of the beer a few minutes after the pour. The head is a nice, off white color. It has left an incredible amount of lacing in the glass and it has been maybe 20 minutes and it shows no signs of leaving. It seems heavily carbed at first but it lightens up a bit though the carbonation is still very prominent.  Aroma wise, it is very light. All I am getting is the citrusy aroma of the hops as well as some grassiness. As it warms up a bit, I am getting more fruitiness in the aroma as well.  The taste is not at all what I expected. I had expected a hop bomb, but its actually not very bitter at all. Its incredibly sweet, with a slight fruity taste up front and a little hoppy bitterness at the end. The best way to get a hoppy taste out of this brew is to burp, which I just did, as it will yield a nice hop flavor for you to enjoy! I'm amazed at the complexity that is coming from this double IPA, which are normally just hob bombs in my experience.  As for drinkability, this beer is very smooth and surprisingly drinkable given the fact that it comes in at a hefty 9% ABV. However, I don't really see myself ever downing more than two of these in one sitting. Though its very pleasant to drink, my mouth is feeling a bit dead after getting halfway through my pint glass as though I just drank coffee that was too hot (though a bit more mild than that... you know what I'm saying). I'm really amazed at how well the alcohol is masked. Even after letting it warm up for 15 minutes, I haven't been able to taste the alcohol at all.  Overall, this might be my second favorite DFH brew, just behind their Indian Brown Ale (due entirely to stylistic preference). It really lives up to the hype they try to build around the DFH brand... its very complex, has lots of different things going on, and is a very interesting experience to drink. I am very glad I picked this up and I'm glad I have three more sitting in the fridge, though I don't know if I will get this one again.

A: Deep reddish, full color, with a thick, almost picture perfect creamy off-white head, great lacing on the glass. Bubbly at first but that settled quickly.  S: Incredibly hoppy on the nose. There are lots of acidic fruits present and like the 60 Minute IPA, I get a clear aroma of freshly baked bread. It smells extremely full, sweet and rich.  T: Very bitter fruit at the front, subtle sweet malt toffee and then a bitter finish. Thick, yet very smooth and pretty well balanced. Aftertaste is a sticky sweet.  M: Creamy, rich and very smooth with a substantial body. It absolutely coats your mouth with sweetness.  Drinkability: This is a solid brew and perfectly balanced. Personally, I'm not sure I would enjoy more than 1-2 of these so I'm not sold it would be a great session beer.

Smell is primarily dominated by a bitter hop aroma, but a faint malt sweetness and barley notes come through as well.  Taste is assertive, yet impeccably balanced. A bold hop presence pulls through first, and is effectively complemented by a rich malt sweetness. The sweetness subsides on the finish, however, and the hops come through a bit more. A warming alcohol character comes through as well as the beer warms.  Mouthfeel is on the full side of medium-bodied, carbonation is ample.  For a beer with this high of an ABV and this assertive of a flavor profile, I'd say 90 Minute IPA is extremely drinkable.

10099,2093,youngblood,4.15,"Pours a darkish amber. White head sits on top rather proudly. Great lace, looking a bit sticky.  Mostly pine coming off the nose, although there is a slight hint of citrus. The malt backbone is very prevalent as well though, asserting some welcome caramel and bread notes.  The taste tends to lean more towards the malt than the hops which really surprised me, but as the beer goes down the entire thing evens out very nicely. It becomes a very smooth transition from slightly dry pine/floral to caramel.  This is a well weighted beer, goes down smoothly without a hitch. Great all around.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,jpaltan,4.22,"burnt orange, hints of ruby.. thick foamy head that dies down to a thin layer. coats the sides of the glass well. the nose is a punch of hops. citrusy and oh so beautiful. love the multiple citrus fruits going on in there, maybe a hint of maltiness and caramel. the taste is definately bitter, citrusy... up front there is more of that caramel, then the hops come and thrash the tongue a bit. mouthfeel coats the tongue nicely, a bit syrupy. drinkability is insanely good. i can't believe this beer is 9%.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,Natural510,4.4,"12oz bottle, dated 06/16/09. Could be fresher, but that's okay.  Medium pumpkin-orange color, decent head & lacing. Orange-citrus to the nose; sweet with an herbal hop finish. Initially bright, sweet, citric flavor. Orange-grapefruit bursts on the scene, sweet & tangy. Floral quality comes through, finished with a creeping bitterness. Herbal, rather than pine, quality to fresh hop notes. Very clean; hoppy but not overbearing. Quenching, refreshing. Mild bitterness in throat, medium-bodied. Probably the smoothest and most accessible of all the DIPAs, which is surprising given the reputation of DFH. Extremely drinkable; bitter, smooth & sweet are not qualities which usually meld together but they pull it off in spades here.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Rmassimiano,4.76,"A - Nice amber color that is reminiscent of a light maple syrup. The head it a perfect white about an inch deep.  S - Very sweet citrusy hoppy aroma. I can even make out the malt smell through the hops.  T - Wow. This beer is really incredible. Hops are just as sweet as they are bitter. The hops are not over bearing, they are just bitter enough to allow the malt to come through.  M - I love how think the beer feels. Its much more viscous than other beers but personally I like this style alot.  D - I love a good hoppy beer and this one has been talked up quite a bit so I thought there was alot going to be some disappointment but I was pleasantly surprised. I love the hoppy and malty balance with the thick mouthfeel. I will definitely be drinking it again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,BevMoAndrew,4.65,"Served into a Bruery Tulip glass at about 45 degrees. Appearance - an clear orangish copper with thick, creamy colored froth. Smell - Holy hop! Grapefruit, orange peel, apricots, wild flowers, green hop leaves, hop spiciness (noble hops used?), caramel malts, light graininess. very pronounced and pretty, but I definitely get the 9% abv or else I'd rate this a perfect 5. Taste - On the nose I definitely get louds of hops with a little bit of the malts, but on the taste, I get tons of malts with a little bit of hops...caramel, light chocolate, , grapefruit, oranges, apricots, hop flowers. great mouthfeel and very smooth. I'm kind of surprised that the IBUs aren't more noticeable. Drinkability - Very drinkable for a 9% abv IPA! I like this style of IPA where it has more of a hop aroma and flavor profile rather than a hop bitterness profile. I can see why this is one of the best.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Intimidtor,4.4,Great beer. Sampled this beer initialy at THE PUB in Lakewood Ohio from a 12 oz bottle. I love Double IPAs but Dogfsih has created something special here. Above and beyond any IPA out there. Poured into my X-mas in July Winking Lizard glass. About a finger width of head and nice slightly reddish color. First sip instantly got my attention. I realized that I had found a top five beer. Great rich taste with lingering finish. Enjoyed every drop and couldn't wait for the next one. Keep up the good work there at DFH brewery. Cant wait to try the 120 IPA.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,cdkrenz,4.83,"A - This is a great looking IPA. It has a clear and crisp deep orange body with a modest head that is pure white and it appears to be going nowhere. Very inviting brew.  S - Rich and smooth hoppy aroma that begs for consumption.  T - Wow... It has a smooth hoppy flavor to start. It's followed by a hint of alcohol and a Belgian style malt flavor that really makes this unique. The finish is that of soft hops. This brew is not at all bitter.  M - The feel is smooth and soft throughout with a hint of action in the finish. Overall the brew goes down extremely well, probably too well.  ~ This is the best IPA I've ever had. I am so grateful to Mr. Mike Williams of Stevens Point, Wisconsin for his generosity. He traveled to Milwaukee and brought this beer back to me as a birthday gift, and what a gift it has been. My thanks also go out to his wife, Ranee, I don't doubt she too had a say in this wonderful beer choice. Thanks you two.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,muskabeatz,4.17,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle  Pours a very rich, hazy copper/light amber color with a creamy head. Head retention and lacing are both ok.  Thick smell of hops, pine, and some citrus, chased by a sweet malt smell.  Big hop taste that is complemented well by smooth maltiness and alcohol. A bit of caramel, and yeast as well.  Very smooth, almost oily. Perfect amount of body, I would say a hair above medium.  Overall, there were a lot of things that I really like about this beer; however, I get the impression that my palate is not quite developed enough to fully enjoy this beer. I'll be curious to come back to this in the future after having more IPA's under my belt.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,longdivision,4.28,"Poured from a tap into a snifter glass.  Appearance -This had great head retention, and its continuous lacing was admirable. Caramel in color with cascading carbonation throughout.  Smell - Fragrantly sweet, reminiscent of a Belgian yeast. Some malts. In a good way, I'm reminded of bread pudding. I picked up faint, piney hops and alcohol notes as well.  Taste - Wonderful. Again, sweet with Belgian-like yeast up front. Lingering piney, citrusy hops on the finish. The hops were underlying and subtle on the palate, not directly on the tongue if that makes sense. The sweetness and malt character really dominate on this.  Mouthfeel - Medium, pleasant, smooth. I would probably call this a sip and savor beer.  Overall, not what I'd expect for a double IPA at all. I was hesitant to try this, as I am with most double IPAs, but this really was such a rewarding, tasty surprise. I'm going to try and pick some up for home.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,polygman,4.07,"I bought this beer as recommended as being touted as one of the best IPA's out there. Given that it was an imperial/double IPA I poured it into my Gulden Draak tulip glass and finished off the pour hard to fill the tulip with a nice creamy white head. I could see small fragments of the yeast in the glass as I viewed it. Good head retention for a while. Not much lace as the head began to subside.  Smell was of a typical IPA, piney, tropical fruits with mild grapefruit aroma.  The first few tastes of the beer hit me as exactly an IPA, nice bitter hoppiness. Yet as the beer warmed a little, the sweetness of the malt came to the forefront of the palate. It became very sweet with malt over the course of the glass. I'm not exactly sure I would call this a double IPA given the tremendous malt sweetness by the end of its session. It almost tastes as if it was a Belgian / IPA blend such as the few hybrid offerings available.  As the drink warmed I could sense the alcohol swirling around my mouth and the aroma being drawn through my nose. The 9% was quite evident as the beer warmed. Overall, I felt the beer was tremendously balanced between the hops and sweet barley taste. It is a fine beer and although I feel it fell short of a true imperial IPA, missing the pronounced bitterness notes, I found it hit its highs elsewhere and was quite satisfying.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,gatorbreath,4.4,"Enjoyed my first dogfish head brew.  Pours a nice color, thin pour, with minimal head and some lacing. The taste is of a little bite, not much citrus balance to the hoppiness, although it is not overwhelming. The drinkability is good on this one and would enjoy another growler fill.  Definitely got me geared up to try the 120 minute to see what the fuss is about.  I enjoyed this brew though, nonetheless, but there are other DIPAs I prefer over this one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,microbrew52,4.5,"This is actually more drinkable and desirable than the 60 minute, especially for the broader audience.

A sweet, biscuity malt aroma was also quite prominent.  Immediately present is an upfront hop profile, herbal and piney, not too bitter. Some citrus notes as well. A biscuity, caramel malt sweetness prevent the hops from stealing the show. With the smoothness of the alcohol, this brew balances nicely.  Smooth on the palate, with a thicker, almost chewy mouthfeel. Carbonation level is spot-on.

10099,2093,PartyBear,4.45,"Appearance: Deep red colour, with a thick creamy off-white head, good lacing on the glass, and very little carbonation.  Aroma: Incredibly pungent resinous hops on the nose. There are lots of acidic fruits flying around the glass. The aromas give off a almost smokey character due to the strength.  Taste: Lots of bitter fruit at the front, along with a subtle sweet crystal malt toffees. The hops are biting and bitter, lots of citrus and powerful resiny hoppiness but it is perfectly balanced out by the malts.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and smooth, with a substantial body. The carbonation is minimal, which gives it a silky texture.  Drinkability: This is an almost perfectly balanced DIPA, that is what sets it apart from the others in this grossly overpopulated style. This is one of the only beers that I have been prepared to give a 5 to for drinkability, and considering this is a 9% beer, that is something special. Is it the best DIPA?

10099,2093,Mavajo,4.43,"On tap at Taco Mac.  Color was a clear amber. There was a bit of haze, but I attributed that to the chilled glass. Haze was about a finger thick and white. No telling how long it sat at the bar before it got to me, though. Nice sticky lacing the whole way down.  Nose is, of course, dominated by hops. Notes of pine, grapefruit. No real citrus to speak of, in my opinion. Taste is great. It's hoppy and bitter, but not harshly so. This beer doesn't try to assault your tastebuds and force you to your knees with bitterness overload. It's very nicely balanced with ample maltiness. But don't be fooled - it's a ADIPA, so the dominant notes are still hops and bitterness. It's just not nearly as brutal as the ones from out west.  The mouthfeel is medium, smooth and with medium carbonation. The 9% ABV is barely noticeable. All of this combines for a lethally drinkable brew.

Mmm floral hops and bready malts. Smells of toasted and caramelly malts. Just a touch of alcohol in the nose, but not in an offensive way.  D. This beer exemplifies the stereotypical balanced east coast balanced IPA as opposed to the west coast raw hop bomb IPA. In general I prefer the intense citrus and tropical fruit forward IPAs but the balanced taste of this beer is quite delicious. Slight fruit rind with a good dose of piney hops and a hefty presence of bready malt. Neither overly bitter or sweet.  M. Very nice medium body and just the right carbonation.  D.

Lots of pine, caramel and apricot in the flavor with a thick honey-like finish and feel to it. Many say this beer tastes too malty and I understand that-but this is a hop monster first and foremost.

Starts out with sweet malt then the hops build to a slightly bitter finish. Balanced between hoppy and sweet but kinda wish it had a bite more of a hop bite at the end. Mouthfeel was nice and creamy with good carb levels and crisp finish.  Overall, an excellent ADIPA that I highly recommend.

Has a lot of coffee and bitter chocolate flavors on the finish. This is a very big beer, has a great flavor but drinkability is limited to just one bottle at a time for me.

From a rich salty slightly smokey bitterness to honey to delicate fruit flavors like peach and apricot. Sorry though, I'm not a hop head. The amazing malt sweetness really helps to balance this beer out but eventually the enjoyable crisp snap of the hops on the finish dries my tongue out and all that great flavor gets stepped on by the bitterness. Still this is my favorite IPA.  Mouthfeel: Tiny bubble carbonation nice and doesn't interfere with flavor, thicker / velvet mouth feel.

Even a bit of a peach/pineapple note. A second layer of resiny pine and herbal character lurks around.  T: A big mouthful of malt initially, both pale and caramel, providing substantial sweetness for the style. A rush of citric hop flavors immediately follows. Predominantly grapefruit, with splashes of orange and pineapple at times, along with a nice underlying pinyness. Bitterness is firm but by no means overwhelming. A faint note of alcohol is occasionally detectable.  M: Moderately full-bodied. At times quite sticky, oily, and resiny. A bit dry into the finish. Carbonation is medium-soft. The alcohol provides some flashes of heat.  D: This is a delicious beer no matter how you define the Imperial IPA.

Very smooth. Very well balanced. Lots of alcohol though. The high alcohol content is extremely noticeable to me, especially lingering in the throat. Good bitterness but not bracingly so.  M: Creamy and delicate. Low carbonation for me.  D: The high alcohol content didn't sneak up on me, it was very present the whole time. I only drank one, it was all I wanted to drink.

10099,2093,Lolli1315,4.22,"A- Orange color that can be seen through. Not much of a head, about half of a finger and not very much lacing.  S- The sweet malt and fruit/citrus are the first notes to hit the nose. Was a little surprised that I was not initially getting the hop smell, but soon afterwards it came on fairly strong.  T- Much sweeter than I thought a DIPA would be and not quite as bitter. Fairly well balanced for and I consider that a good thing in some aspects. The grapefruit taste was apparent up front with the hops coming on fairly strong. Hop oil taste seems noticeable as well. The 9.00% alcohol also becomes apparent, not a huge turnoff but it might be a little better if it was masked more, but of course it becomes a little difficult at such a high number. Different take on an IPA/DIPA from what I have seen, great to see that breweries aren't just sticking to the same exact beers that we see every day.  M- Fairly thin mouthfeel. Great for an IPA/DIPA and would work well for a summer evening or an early fall evening.  D- I would guess that a lot of hop heads would argue that this is too sweet to be a beer that is highly drinkable, but I think the sweetness molded with the bitterness makes this pretty enjoyable. Not hard to finish a beer let alone open up another one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Nice lacing.  S: Big IPA smell. Hops, cirtrus, pine, a little boozy... A fairly aggressive smelling ale. I knew I had to taste it soon.  T: Very flavorful with lots of fruit characteristics. Grapefruit, pineapple and grapes. Along with the bitterness and hops it's very well balanced and makes for a great tasting brew.  M: Medium heavy mouthfeel. Fairly carbonated for being in my fridge overnight. Perfect really.  D: The great taste really makes this beer and makes it so drinkable. It's a little boozy but it tastes so good you just can't stop drinking it.  Overall, a really good DIPA that lives up to the hype.

Nose is like Thanksgiving dinner: cranberry, spiced orange, dried leaves, dark cake and a whiff of alcohol. Bright juicy red berry malts with pine sap, bark, gingery, earthy hops, maybe a hint of blood orange. No real linger. Hops overtake malts as it warms (?). 9% ABV comes through, sticky, medium to heavy body.  It's been said before but: how is this not a Barleywine? Maybe I'm wrong, but first thought was SN Bigfoot.  Not a West Coast brew, no citrus to speak of. Heavy malts hide the 90 IBUs. Too hot and full bodied to be very drinkable. Still a heavyweight, though.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,canislupus88,4.56,"The beer looks a little more amber colored than most IPA's and I think that is because of the amount of caramel in it.  The smell is grapefruit/citrus with some caramel.  It starts out very sweet I think (for an IPA) definite caramel in the start then the grapefruit and citrus comes through in the middle with the wonderful bitter after taste from the hops in the end just like a great IPA. The alcohol is well hidden, kind of feel the alcohol in the mouth in the after taste, but I mean for a 9% it is well hidden by the tremendous flavors of the beer.  The mouthfeel is great, hoppy, and well carbinated.  Not too drinkable from the flavors because it is so sweet and the high alcohol, it is a very filling beer. I could probably have two then I want something more IPA bitter like maybe a two hearted from bell's or something.  This really is a great beer though, I mean a definite must try for someone who likes IPA's, and is sweeter than most IPA's due to the amount of caramel in the beer, but will finish like a normal IPA does, which is a hoppy bitterness.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Upon recommendation of a fellow beer geek that swears by them I'm giving them another shot...  A pours a clear amber color with an off white head that dissipated over the next 2 minutes.  S a nice amount of malt and resinous citrusy hops. Concentrated orange and almost raisin like maybe from the malt and possibly the hops as well.  T Much better than I could remember, I am only 23 my palate was probably under developed when had it last. The resinous flavor of the hops was the same as on the nose and stuck in the mouth for a while but it also had a good citrus flavor that blended really well with the malts. I normally get a raisin flavor in the 120 minute and I definitely get it here also  M I'd call it medium weight, maybe slightly fuller bodied than that, a good body for the flavors but I might prefer a little bit more full.

10099,2093,GarrisWH,4.3,"A - Pours a clear, rich orange-tinged amber color with a thick, creamy, off-white head. Great retention and leaves some very nice lacing behind.  S - A bit of sweet, caramel maltiness hits the nose first, then the potent hop aromas come through. Citrus - mostly grapefruit - and pine are most notable. There is also a slightly herbal character to the hops and a hint of tropical fruit. For 9%, the alcohol is barely noticeable in the aroma.  T - More balanced in flavor than I expected from the smell. Ample amounts of rich, slightly toasty caramel malt stand out in the flavor through the finish. The hops are definitely there though with a nice, spicy character, and lend mostly pine and citrus flavors. A bit of alcohol comes through, but it's pretty mellow for 9%. Very tasty, powerful flavors, and a nice balance.  M - Medium-bodied with a crisp carbonation. Very smooth drinking overall.  D - A very solid DIPA that goes down pretty easily despite its fairly high ABV.

Smells mostly of floral hops with some pine notes and a bit of maltyness mixed in. The taste, as expected, is a more intense 60 min. Wave upon wave of hop flavor, mixing between bitterness and citrus. Full bodied with some medicinal undertones, the balance is pretty darn good for the amount of hops they say they put in it.

But with the slamming it has gotten again by hop crazed West Coasters...I though it could use a fair evaluation to complement the other 2,200.  Reddish orange color with massive head that's doesn't go anywhere...best head retention Ive ever seen...  Lots of fresh oranges and pine, some citrus. Little floral character. Lots of fruit.  Warm alcohol presence upfront, held together well through its malt background and and creamy mouthfeel. Mellow hoppiness rides high here, but with this gigantic malt background, its a nice ride...comfortable, smooth, sporty and stylish.

After it recededs I believe this is the thickest stickiest lacing I've ever seen. It coats the glass like gobs of pudding. The aroma is super piney, floral hops abound through the nostrils. Grapefruit and lemon are present as well. The flavor much smother then I expected. The hop kick is there but, the malt comes in and mellows everything out. It's piney and bitter fruit yet smooth like bourbon. Medium to full body little carbonation. Slight warming effect. I find this to be a perfect balance of hops and malt.

A nice two finger tan foamy head that held out for quite a while and left nice sticky lacing behind. Good carbonation, but not overtly effervescent.  Smell: A very unique sweet and floral hops nose, with hemp and citrus scents in the mix. Smells very clean and bright.  Taste: A big mouthful of unique tasting hops (hemp, orange peel, fresh grass) up front with a little bitterness that leads to a slightly sweet and dry finish with a little lingering hops bitterness, plus a surprising little caramel malt in the mix. A very delicious IPA, and the claim of being ""possibly the best IPA in America"" may not just be hype...it's a really fantastic and unique IPA.  Mouth Feel: Clean and crisp, light-to-medium body and a good clean finish on the palette.  Drinkability: Very drinkable. A perfect straight-from-the-cooler ice cold IPA option on a warm summer day. I will definitely seek this one out again when I'm in the mood for a great American IPA. The ABV is deceptively high, so watch out for that...because these beers go down VERY easily.

10099,2093,jeffthecheff,4,"Bottled on 7/1/09. Sampled 9/2.  I poured this beer in to my very large, bowl shaped B&B cognac snifter. The color is light amber and clear. Nice, billowy head that turns down to a nice nice foamy lace. The head is lost likley due to the huge surface area in my glass, but a quick swirl makes a nice, foamy, one finger head.  Aroma is very herbal. This was probably the first DIPA or very hoppy beer I've ever had, and I remember being amazed at how aromatic it was. This is still one of the best smelling DIPA's I've had, although a few were probably stronger. The character is very nice though. The first aroma that comes through is an obvious woody pine or tree aroma. There was recently a storm in my area that destroyed a lot of trees, and the smell in the air is a lot like this beer. There is also an obvious grapefruit aroma that doesn't just resemble a grapefruit, it smells how a grapefruit tastes. The aroma blend here is just a classic American hops used for a classic pale ale only more resiny and strong. As it warms up, some alcohol shows through.  The flavor is big in both malt and hops. Very bitter and resiny, with a big pine needle presence. The malt comes through with a syrupy, caramel malt sweetness that really rounds the beer out and justifies the ""imperial"" name.  Mouthfeel is thick and full bodied. Carbonation is medium or medium low. A nice sipper good in small quantities. You wouldn't finish a four pack of these like you might take down a six pack of a normal strength beer.  Overall, this is a very good beer and one of the DIPA's I've bought consistently. The freshness date is there, so you know what your getting in to. A couple months of age doesn't really hurt this beer unlike some DIPA's, which I really give it credit for. I will try to age one of these for a year and see how it does, I'd imagine it can improve. Another note is that the squall IPA is very similar to this but with a more interesting, tropical fruit aroma and a much better mouthfeel.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

D: about as drinkable as straight cheap bourbon.  I love IMP IPA's and can't even begin to understand the buzz about this beer. In fact it makes me mad when its held up as the example of an east coast imp IPA, there are numerous better east coast ipa's. The alcohol stays on the palate for multiple minutes after drinking.

It manages to have a definite hop taste without being very bitter.  The mouthfeel is full and smooth. The carbonation is light and plays a small role in the experience.  In one word: decadent.

It kind of freaked me out. Ive had this beer maybe 4 times and its been the same smell every time. Ive heard people talk about this in off batches or bottles so Im not sure whats going on here. Getting through the coffee smell which is difficult theres a light earthy smell.  Tastes like coffee as well. Sort of a really roasty bitterness with all those hops. Its such an odd taste. i couldnt tell if I liked it or not. Not a drain pour but not worth the hype.  Mouthfeel was nice. More ""thick"" than I expected. Nice carbonation with a boozey sting.

I also pick up some barely notes and maybe some pine.  Taste - First thing that comes to mind is hops of some kind that I've never had before, barley does play a big role in the taste of this beer too. It is ""two-row"" barley (so says the bottle) The beginning is a constant barrage of hops then it balances sort of, it leaves a semi-sweet/semi-bitter after taste. Very enjoyable though.  MF - Medium body. Easy to drink but should be drank slowly because of high ABV. Mild carbonation.  Drinkability - I am impressed with how a beer with this high of an ABV and 90 IBU can be not a completely wet finish.

Lacing is wonderful and sticky, spewing rings around the glass. Not quite sure of how flat and clear the body is, but elsewhere excellent.  Nose is really nice, with a pungent, almost ticklingly strong aroma of hops, very tangy and citrusy but balanced out quite nicely with some rich caramelly malt. Hints of lemongrass and a lot of barley, pretty damned nice, but almost too strong. It makes my nose itch.  Taste is rich in malty goodness, with a great deal of barley and earthy toffee with an almond nougat kind of nuttiness around the edge, and a tart sizzle on the mid-palate not unlike lime. Has a very dank, potently rich and almost funky finish, with a lot of warming alcohol giving it a stately cognac character on the back, but never burning. It goes down smoothly, thanks I think to the hops which are there to lend it bitterness and an almost acidic back, but are noticeably ineffective in terms of exploding with hoppy bitterness.  In fact, the hopping seems very English and it gives this more of an American Strong Ale character than a DIPA. But it might just be that I'm used to the west coast Amarillo/Cascade hopped IPAs. The biggest character I get from here is the booziness. Very pleasant, this, but not a quaffer. Best enjoyed in moderation.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Its an orangey caramel color, with a pinky's worth of foamy head. lace covers the glass. this beer has aroma alright. its showing it off! oh so hoppy, dried fruits, no alcohol comes through the nose. a much more bitter taste than i expected, there's a bite to it. i taste the hops, with some earthiness too. for the amount of alcohol in it (9%) its very very well disguised. I'm not crazy about the mouthfeel. medium carbonation which is good, but i feel like its rather dry. overall its a pretty drinkable beer. Idk if it quite lived up to the hype for me, but it still is a good beer. I would have this again, and would like to try other DFH brews.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,DeathbySexyBT,4.37,"A: The big hops give this beer some of the best lacing I have ever seen. The one-finger of head is persistent and fluffy. The body is a light, polished-bronze with a bit of cloudiness.  S: Hop-heads rejoice! Big herbal, big pine, big citrus (pineapple/kiwi) aromas! Sweet malts round out a magnificent aroma. A slight medicinal whiff was caught on a few inhalations, though.  T: If an IPA were a new species of fruit this is what it would taste like. You almost feel like you are biting into an explosively juicy hop-fruit. Bitter? Hoppily! Oily? Verily! Bready notes come through in waves of malty goodness to round out a well-balanced chorus of intense flavors.  M: A bit alcoholic. Not unpleasant, but probably could use some adjustment.  D: This is one of the best DIPAs on the market. I hasten to say that this could very well be one of the best beers on the market, let alone DIPAs. I heartily recommend this selection.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,BatsforBeer,4.65,"Poured from bottle into English pint Date on bottle: 9/22/08  Appearance: Clean clear light amber brown with a small egg shell colored head with very little lacing  Nose: Pleasant floral/grapefruit hops and toasty malt nose, not very strong  Taste: Strong alcohol taste followed by a biscuity toasted malts finishing with faint floral hops.  Mouth feel: Very intense alcohol tingle than almost takes your breath away.  Drinkability: The hoppy bitterness is less than expected but still very enjoyable. I would say that the hops balance the malt in this IPA instead of the other way around. However it does it in such a way that I have never experienced before and that I can not completely describe. This is a great beer and I highly recommend it to anyone, I am on my way to buy more!!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,bobsy,4.02,"Amber pour with a creamy off-white head. Lots of grapefruit in the aroma, with a balancing caramel. Flavour is all about hops. There's a lot of citrus, some pine, the citrus again and then some pine. The malts add a caramel flavour (and the mind imagines texture too), and the alcohol peeks out, not fully hidden. Sticky mouthfeel - lots of hop oils - and moderate carbonation. Drinkability is okay, but its not as balanced as I hoped, and although enjoyable I'd follow it up with something else.  I really don't feel this has the cleaness or finesse of the 60 minute - I'm swimming against the tide on this, but I think that bigger isn't always better.  Edit: Derek pulled out an aged version the other night that had 4 years on it. I'm shocked at how well this beer has held up. Bravo!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,atremains,4.53,Pours a deep golden-honey orange with slightly off white thick creamy head. Smell is citrus hops and sweet malts along with taste. A pineapple-esque feel. The mouthfeel is creamy with a dlicious amount of carbonation. Very drinkable for a nine percent beer though the alcohol comes out more as the brew warms.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,stakem,4.38,"Bottled date of 4/21/09.  Pours a clear orange with 1 finger head that hangs around until the beverage is nearly all. Also has a bunch of lacing all around the glass. Aroma is nice and hoppy, plenty of floral and citrus hop scent along with some sweetness in the nose. Taking a sip, you are welcomed by the hops but it is not overloaded in bitterness considering it is an Imperial IPA. There is also a nice amount of malty sweetness about the taste as well. Carbination is perfect, mouthfeel is medium. Alcohol is not fully present until the finish and even that is misleading to think that this is 9%. Well done.  I remember the first time I had an IPA from dogfish head and ever since that day, they keep growing on me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,ExtraStout,4.85,"What can I say that hasn't been said so far, it's a great brew.  Extremely well balanced, the hops, ABV%, etc. Other than being more costly, there are no real drawbacks to this fine brew.  I haven't had any other Dogfish Head Craft Brews to compare but I can't imagine finding a better one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,DwnTwnBwn,4.12,A- Poured into a pint glass with a 1.5 finger head. A deep golden clear color. Laces well.  S - Good citrus and grapefruit nose. More floral in character than that of a pine tree. Sweet malt rounds it out.  T - Pretty good citrus character up front. Much like the smell it's more of a sweet beer then an over powering hop monster.  M - Medium full body. Slightly cloying. Light carbonation.  D - I would like to taste this fresh and on tap before I make my final judgment. But this DIPA isn't too impressive. But it seems like it's just not fresh enough.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,kegger22,4.2,"Clear amber with a decent head that quickly faded. A citrus aroma with malty sweetness backing it up. As to the taste, the citrus was there in the form of orange. So was the sweet malt, but with a pine needle bitter cast at the end. Feel was medium bodied with a slightly oily feel. Drinkability was good, but it's a 9.0 ABV, so be careful.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,skrib09,4.03,"poured a dull copper color, super hazy, with an off-white head. poor retention with ok lacing.  smells subdued but hoppy. more pine than citrus. a bitter astringency in the nose and some dull malt.  bitter citrus rind and a mild resin flavor in the forefront. a hint of pine with malt and sweetness in the aftertaste. really not too much going on.  crispy mouthfeel for an ipa. smooth on the palate. good carbonation level.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,PSUBeerman,4.32,"12 oz bottle, goblet  Had this on tap at DFH in Rehoboth, but reviewing the bottle  Pours a rich amber & bronze color. Off white creamy head that dissipated but left a nice lacing and a constant lid.  Aroma is sweet and hoppy. Plenty of hop fragrance with a malty and fruity background.  Hop flavor immediately up front, but slides into a nicely balanced malt taste. Citrusy as well as other fruits noticeable, possibly apple. There is an aftertone of some spice as well.  Nice and smooth, not too viscous or thick. Despite the ABV, this is rather drinkable and forgiving on the palate. I had this years ago, but I think I like it much more now.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,bargerking,4.57,Poured a brown/amber color. Smell of hops and a toasty malt. Taste is hoppy at first and then a nice toasty almost caramel malt finish. Good head retention and decent lacing. Mouthful is not that harsh but a decent thick body. This beer is off the charts on drinkability and I would have never guessed it to be at 9%. Its wise to sip this beer but could easily be drank by the pint. Another awesome DFH brew!,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,johannasclimacus,4.55,"12 ounce bottle into a Stone tulip (don't tell either of them!)  Pours a nice goldeny amber, copper color with a perfect one inch layer of head. Lots of lacing, seems like it sticks to the glass.  Plenty of hop and malt smells and flavors. This one is, for an imperial, balanced in its extremeness - lots of hops but lots of malt sweetness to back it up. In the bottle, the sweetness stuck with my palate and made the beer much less bitter and much less of a hop bomb than most of the imperial IPAs I've had. This highlights one thing I really appreciate about DFH, that their beers are usually unique. While there is a big hop profile - a sort of piney, puckering oiliness, it's contained by the malt backbone nicely. Despite the oiliness of the hops, the finish was pretty dry and even bready at times.  I'm curious to see the difference in bottle vs draft. My bottle is pretty fresh with a brewed on date in the middle of June.  Drinkability is pretty good although I'm feeling the alcohol right now. It makes its presence felt in the finish with a warming effect, but doesn't override any flavors like some inferior high ABVs I've tried. I would easily go back for two or three more of these if I had them, and afterwords I think I'd be feeling pretty happy.  Overall, another great beer in a collection of great beers from Dogfish.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,julian1117,4.37,"Bought this at the Beer Yard in Wayne, PA and must regard it as one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Poured a translucent burnt honey. Smells of strong hops. Tastes of powerful hops. Mouthfeel delightfully syrupy. Drinkability still relatively high. This has usurped my favorite IPA: Prussia's Pride IPA from Rock Bottom.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,johntangus,4.25,poured into duvel tulip glass. nice two finger head that dissapates into a nice thin head surface that creeps laciness down the sides. a lovely copper-gold color.  has a slightly boozy malty smell.  i was surprised with the maltiness. for the style it seems a bit malt-heavy. almost barleywine territory. the hops make their appearance on the back end.  this is only the second dfh beer that i have tried. had to drive to nc to get it. overall a good beer. definitely surprised by the sweetness.  the high abv is making this one a sipper.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Raugupatis,4,"I visited the Yardhouse in Brea this past weekend and learned that they had just added this one to the line-up as a regular offering.  The first swallow was traditional IPA hoppiness. After a coupld seconds, it mellowed out and offered up light fruits and malt.  Good balance of the bitterness of the hops and the fruit and sweetness of the malt.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,hardy008,4.2,"Pours an orange gold color with a white foamy head which leaves a beautiful sticky lace. The smell is grapefruit peelings and floral hops. Some malt sweetness is also present in the aroma. The flavor is the same as the aroma, but it is much sweeter than I would have expected.Medium bodied, nicely carbonated, and the alcohol is well disguised. The drinkability is quite good.

10099,2093,BuckeyeOne,2.76,"Got this at Hudson's, a new joint in Seattle. Poured into a 12 oz. glass a deep mahogany orange color with a decent off-white head.  The initial smell is biscuity sweetness with citrusy hops.  I hated the first sips of this beer. I was expecting a clean, dry bitter hoppiness. All I got was malt with alcohol, like rubbing alcohol.  This was smooth with just the right amount of carbonation. It didn't seem heavy at all, which is what I expected with the sweetness.  I will not have this again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,prosper,1.9,"Pours a crystal clear amber colour with a very slightly off-white head. Disappears quickly, leaves some lacing.  Smells of sticky, fruity malts, and hops - but not as strong as expected.  Taste is wrong. Reminds me of rubbing alcohol - pungent alcohol, phenolic solvents. Almost belgian levels of malt-fruitiness. Melted plastic. Hot on the back of the throat - fuesels. A drain pour; yech!  Other than the foul taste, the body was decent, but the nasty flavours killed any drinkability.  This is a well-regarded beer, so I can only assume I got a bad bottle.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,bjacobsen,4.03,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle.  A- Pours a ruby, juicy color. Very nice, substantive off-white head that holds on nicely and provides some solid lacing as well.  S- Nice! Citrus and Pine/Floral aromas are great. The grapefruity citrus is a little more prominent than the the floral pine, but man am I thirsty! This aroma is why I love the DIPA so much!!! So inviting.  T-Taste mirrors the aromas. A wonderfully refreshing blast of citrus (led by grapefruit) and hops but it certainly has a sweet malt balance, much more obvious than any other DIPA. Dry finish, as anticipated with a barely noticeable warmth in the back. Leaves me puckering and salivating like a DIPA but it doesn't have the palate-obliterating quality that most would have. A touch sweet overal but very tasty!  M- Medium body with a pleasant carbonation. This beer has the right balance of resin and hop-oils that pushes a lovely flavor onto the palate.  D- Certainly the most drinkable DIPA to date. A great example of a hoppy gem that doesn't seem to have to flex it's muscles to do so.  If there is such a thing, I would suggest this as the gateway DIPA. It has a lot of the beautiful characteristics classic to the style without the intimidation (that Stone Brew Co. brags about).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Rhynes2,4.48,"I was very excited to get to try this beer. Pours a nice orange color with an off white foamy head. Laced all the way down the glass. When I compare it to the 60 min IPA this one wins in every category. The smell of hops is better, color is richer. Im normally a fan of the Stone IPA but this one gets right in the top few favorite IPAs. I'll be coming back for more of this one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,GordonQuid,4.64,"Poured into a freshly washed Sam Adams ""Bubble"" glass.  Bronze in color, clear with a half inch head and some ""legs' in the lacing.  The smell is complex; dark ripened fruit, citrus and piney earth-tones.  Taste is complex as well; sharp hop bite, sweet cara-malts. It has a slight grainy quality accompanied with an apricot and raisin aftertaste.  Very delicious! Easy to drink for a heavier IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,jjansen,4.7,my non-technical review of this is simply: i love this beer. i could drink this daily although not in the quantities I would like to or else I would likely not have a job.

It pours with a fizzy head of about an inch which takes a few minutes to recede. Lacing remains on the glass throughout.  Smell: A little bit of toasted barley scent, faint hop aroma.  Taste: Delicious. Balanced hops and malt, with a sweetness on the finish mixed in with the bitterness. For an IPA, it's not assertively hoppy to my taste.  Mouthfeel: The bitterness lingers a bit, in a nice way. I say it's good.  Drinkability: I could have several. The high percentage is masked by its smoothness.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,dstickel,4.13,"After reading so many great reviews of this beer, i bought a bottle with high hopes. I wasn't let down by any means, but it's not as good as hopslam. Then again I could be biased because I live in Michigan. This tasted bitter, but not too bitter, and also nice and malty. I would have liked more hops flavor but that's just a preference. Cant' taste the alcohol at all even though it's 9% ABV. Overall good, I would recommend it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Aroma is fresh floral hops, breaded malts, and some citrus elements like orange and pineapple.  The hops hit you like a ton of bricks on the first sip (although it is smooth at the start). Very bitter, with hop oil present all the way through. Malts are subdued somewhat, although they are here and have a nice chewiness to them. Strong alcohol presence.  Mouthfeel is a smooth medium body with little carbonation that rolls off the tongue. Although it goes down smooth, the complex flavors and 9% ABV limit me to one, two at the most.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,ShogoKawada,4.7,"I've reviewed this out of the bottle, time for the tap review. Was enjoyed at 'Yesterdays' in Newport, RI. from notes:  A- Served in a DFH snifter. Beautiful coloration and head. The DFH snifter adds to the experience, too. Wonderful presentation. Great lacing, too.  S- Hops, hops, hops. DFH has found some proprietary blend of hops that is just fantastic. New pine growth and floral sweetness dominate. This beer is begging to be drank.  T- Hoppity hops! Amazing taste. As noted, DFH has an amazing hop profile. Truly tasty beer. Very good body and aftertaste. Rich caramel backbone is what sets this beer apart from many other DIPAs.  M- Leaves you wanting more. Sublime.  D- Considering the ABV, this beer is extraordinarily drinkable, especially if you have a designated driver. A snifter of DFH 90 minute is one of my all-time greatest beer experiences. Truly a masterpiece.... If you ever see this on tap, order three!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,halfhorsefilms,4.45,"Drank while listening to Roy Rogers & Robert Johnson.  Very little head that seemed to disappear, but those happy tiny bubbles kept doing their job to keep a faint outline around the edges. Honey-like appearance with a VERY strong aroma of oranges.  WOOO! Watch out, because I didn't expect that much malt! I should have given more attention to the label, which reads ""balanced by a ridiculous amount of English Two-row Barley."" They were right. Very smooth with a lingering crispness in the back of the throat, but neither the malt nor hops becomes dominant over the other.  As it warms, the smell of malt and hops becomes much more predominant than citrus. My only complaint is that halfway though I smelled a strong boozy smell that detracted from the taste.  Drinkability:  1. It goes down smooth. 2. It tastes like nothing I've ever had. 3. It's the maltiest IPA I've ever had. 4. It's 9% ABV.  What more can I say?",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,GonzoPizzaBurger,4.1,"Can't say enough about how great this massive ipa is. Another hit from DFH. Poured from a 12 oz bottle. Golden color with amber tones. Great retention and lacing.

Decent head retention in my Duvel glass as it recedes after a few minutes leaving very nice lacing.  Smells hoppy im not smelling really any malts just some grapefruit and piney notes.  Taste is fantastic, and suprisingly there's malt here. That was the big shocker here for me being my first DIPA. Not a huge blast but enough. But up front you get that hop madness, with some pine and citrus notes. Finishes with a good malt flavor thats a bit syrupy.  To me this beer has exceptional mouthfeel and is much more drinkable then anticipated.

You know the cartoons where something smells so great that you see the smell grows arms and grabs the character by the nose and pulls him closer. That will happen.  T: HOPS!!!  M: Bitter sweet sticky. Lingering, warm. I'm really blown away.  D: Here is the only fault, 9% ABV. Wonderful to drink, but i think one at a time is enough.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I enjoy this immensely.  T-TASTE IS AMAZING! The first thing I taste is a hops, not too over powering, not too subtle, just balanced nicely with a transition into what I call a strawberry citrus flavor. Then it moves back into hops flavor, but it is a mild piney hops with a good solid malty flavor to balance.  M-Incredibly smooth, not thick, but a perfect mouthfeel to compliment the flavor of the beer immensely. This seems to be the perfect time to drink this beer, the summer, and the mouthfeel of this would compliment many summer foods to get excellent food pairings.

Great malt presence as well.  T: Great depth of flavor, extremely balanced. Citrus and piney hops, followed by bready malt and carmel. Alcohol is present as it finishes.  M: Incredibly smooth, full bodied ale. This beer has a creamy texture thats wonderful.  D: This is as drinkable as a 9% beer can be. Incredibly smooth and balanced, and packed with great flavor.

10099,2093,ProfessorCJ,4.35,"I've waited to be able to taste this beer for a long time. I found some here at the Florida gulf Coast. Poured into a chilled pint glass. A large amount of white foam with lacing. Smelled hops before my nose was near the glass. I've had hopped up IPA before, but this is different. It is not as sharp, much more pleasant. First sip is so different from the smell as to be disconcerting. Hints of roasting and a depth of flavor that it is obvious why this beer has received so much praise. Dense on the tongue and full in the mouth. I will definately drink this again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,TheViolator666,4.73,"Dogfish Head is easily becoming one of the most consistent breweries around, IMO. I have not had a beer by these guys that I've been disappointed by yet. They have my full support.  12 oz. bottle poured into Stone Levitation tulip.  A: Absolutely one of the best looking beers I have come across. This one pours a beautiful deep amber color topped with a very thick off-white head. Full lacing on the glass.  S: Smells oddly malty and definitely sweet. Hops come through, but are balanced well by the malt.  T: One of the most complex IPAs I have ever had. The continuous hopping is definitely present in this one. Truly rips the enamel off of your teeth, but I would have it no other way. Very well balanced by the bizarre toasty malt presence. Almost tastes a bit nutty. There is a sweetness as well and a hint of alcohol creeps in towards the back end. Truly wonderful.  M/D: Pretty syrupy, but I don't know if that's a bad thing. This is the definition of double IPA. I once drank an entire 4 pack in one sitting, I don't know if that was the best idea, but I'd say this one's highly drinkable.

10099,2093,McDiddyPop,3.56,"Bottled 3-19-09, enjoyed 7-14-09. Poured from a 12-oz bottle into a DFH shaped pint glass.  This one poured a bright amber/orange with some chill haze and a dense white head that sticks around for quite a while. Sticky, spotty lacing coats the glass. The aroma is all hops. Pungent, bitter, and minty. More strong pine than citrus. Not much malt showing through until it warms. Alcohol is apparent. Tastes very sharp. Lots of intense hop bitterness. Alcohol warmth in the finish. Not much balance in this one but that's not what I think they were going for. Crisp, fizzy mouthfeel compliments the hoppy edge nicely. The hoppiness works wonders in covering the alcohol, and enhances the overall drinkability. Far from my favorite DIPA, but good nonetheless.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,ABOWMan,4.32,"This Ale pours a nice golden orange color with perfect clarity. A nice two finger head of tight white fluffy head paints a pretty picture atop this colorful brew. Good lacing is prevalant on the glass as you take sip after sip.  An aroma of floral hops, citrus (orange), fruity yeast and malt is prevalant.  The flavor is reminiscent of Belgium fruity funky yeast, orange, carmelized sugars, bitter hopps and some spicy note (maybe cardamen?) provide a nice balance of bitter hops, sweet fruit and malt provide a sensory delight. This ale is complex but someopwhat light on the palate.  A very drinkabel brew, but the ABV will catch up with you.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,BBThunderbolt,3.8,"Served in straight pint glass. Poured a very clear, much clearer than most IPAs, golden amber with a slight touch of orangeish tint. About an inch of just off-white head dissipated quickly, leaving a just less than moderate amount of lacing.  Nicely big hop aroma, a noticeable hint of toffee. More of a malt foundation than a lot of ImpIPAs, but the expected citrus is there.  Average amount of body for the style. Nicely drinkable for a hop heavy beer. Worth trying.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,CHSLBrew,3.43,"Poured into a snifter. Thanks to my girlfriend for packing a bottle of this in ther suitcase on her return flight from NYC.  A-Hazed orange-amber brew, somewhat glowing in the setting sunlight. Minimal off-white head rose off the vigorour pour and promptly receded to a thick collar.  S-Earthy, herbal hop aromas. Strong malty aromas, bready, nutty, crackery.  T-Sweet malts, bready and toasted, with a strong toffee flavor. Hop bitterness does a fine job balancing this big malt presence. Hop character is thickly resinous, perfumy, and herbal; flowery. Finishes herbal, resiny, and very bitter; semi-sweet malt remnants, as well.  M-Full bodied beer. Medium-low carbonation is pleasant and easy.  D-A good brew. It's tasty, though perhaps balanced a bit more toward the malt than expected. Warming from the well-hidden alcohol emergees after a couple sips, very comforting as the evening is setting in.  Enjoyed on the porch on a cool summer evening while reading The Satanic Verses for bookclub; a heavy brew for a heavy book :)",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

It is very thick and creamy, long lasting and makes cool rings of lace on the glass after each sip. The body has a slight hazy appearance and a golden amber color.  Smell: The aroma is full of sweet malt and pine resin and citrus hops.  Taste/Mouth Feel: The flavor hits you with a full bodied punch of piney, resiny and citrus hops balanced by thick sweet malt and sweet warming brandy like alcohol. It finishes with more herbal and piney bitterness. The palate has a smooth mellow carbonation with a smooth slick almost sticky texture.

The taste is loaded with hops. That is what it is all about. Some might consider this over the top. Not me. This is the IPA that all IPAs should be measured against.

10099,2093,chinabeergeek,4.03,"12oz, bottled 03/09/09. tasted in late april/early may 2009.  clear, classic amber. 1-finger, off-white/light beige head, recedes to thin but constant layer. great lacing.  aroma: some moderately fresh pine resins and a moderate note of grapefruit rind and zest. gentle notes of malt and caramel with hint of apple esters.  taste: malty sweetness meets moderate hop resins of both pine and citrus, with more of a rind-based quality and only moderately fresh, but fruity enough. mixes with yeast apple esters and giving a moderate, yet not quite bold bitterness. sweet malts and fruitiness in finish, with touch of resins.  medium body, smooth, with a very crisp carbonation, almost fizzy, but back off before getting distracting. finishes quite smooth with just a hint of resins.  seems like my tastes have changed here as well. don't know why i felt it was so hoppy before. this is actually more of a malt-forward DIPA.

Poured amber in color with a nice 1/2 inch creamy head that laced well. Smelled of hops and floral hops; very aromatic floral smell that had a nice combination of sweetness and hops.  Medium carbonation with a delicious taste of hops and floral hops which had a sweet spicy finish; well balanced and smooth. The 9% ABV is not a factor as the hoppy floral flavor is so dominant that you can't taste or feel the alcohol because you are too busy enjoying the mix of flavors on the palate. Gets better as it warms up and is an excellent beer!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,nomomentwasted,4.3,"Had this on-tap today at Porter's Pub at UCSD in an 8oz serving in a tulip glass.  Appearance: Actually a little more yellow than I expected, but still with a nice little head of just over a finger with good foam and a fair amount of carbonation.  Smell: Solid, with hops and citrus being the primary wave, followed by a light sweetness to it of a candy-like nature.  Taste: Hoppy, strong pine, and almost juice-like flavor in its oily texture. It's hops are certainly the primary flavor, with the citrus esters coming through. It's a smooth and complex build with hops, fruit, hops, and alcoholic hoppy finish.  Mouthfeel: Crisp and pretty refreshing, with a slight oily texture and hoppy prickly alcohol on the end.  Drinkability: I tend to be pretty solid at picking out what the ABV of a beer is, but this would've struck me as maybe a 7. Definitely drinks like an IPA for a DIPA, and easily could've had another. Very solid, not out of this world, but still very good.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Secondary notes of grape fruit, lime, flowers and molasses. Every time I sniff it I get something a little different.  T: Sweet with a lot of the caramel and citrus notes of the nose and a very rich and creamy backbone. Fades to burnt caramel and finishes with coffee and chocolate. The hops are citrusy and fresh. The alcohol is carried extremely well through to the finish, which lasts forever.  M: Bold, creamy and very nice. Very fine carbonation perfectly balances the dense dark flavors and accentuates teh hops. Extremely creamy and bright.

Even for a DIPA, this has a ton of alcohol up front, with the smell, taste, and feel of sticky sweet fruit soaked in alcohol. There's a touch of flower nectar in the smell and taste. The feel is chewy and bitter with the hops lingering, and despite the presence of alcohol, this was a pleasure to drink.

10099,2093,sweemzander,4.22,"12oz. bottle poured into an imperial pint glass. Bottled on 04/04/09.  (A)- Pours a clear amber color. Began with a 2-finger head, but dissipated down to a light layer of white bubbles. Some lacing.  (S)- Creaminess of a vanilla/citrus feel. Piney hoppiness. Malty background present. Citrus smell predominately of lemon and grapefruit. Kinda smells like butter at the end?  (T)- Very hoppy/citrusy bitterness that is almost overshadowed by a big, sweet, creamy malty finish that is similar to butterscotch. But in the end is balanced between the two rather well.  (M)- The hop/citrus bite has plenty of acidity in it to create an interesting tension with the carbonation and malty sweetness. All-together, a well rounded and balanced beer, though I can really see how big the sweetness could overtake someone's palate in that way. The alcohol (9%) is hidden pretty well.  (D)- Despite its rather high abv, this is a pretty easy drinker. Its got all the classic DIPA characteristics plus a much sweeter/malty core. Even still, after 3 of these, you will be feeling it both in feeling full and from the alcohol!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,mullenite,4.37,Pours a clear copper in color with a half inch solid white head which sinks down to a thin cap with some larger bubbles around the edges. Leaves an almost solid lacing down the glass.  Smell is floral with a nice combination of pine bitterness and sweet fruits. Some light biscuit in the background with just a touch of a sugar sweet as well.  Taste is mildly hoppy and well balanced. The dominant bitter flavor is pine with the dry biscuit flavor coming in at the finish.  Mouthfeel is on the heavier side of being medium bodied with nice cleansing carbonation.  This is my favorite DIPA because it is so drinkable.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Appearance - Beautiful orange-amber look with a 1 finger frothy white head that laces down the glass.  Smell- Mostly roasted malt smell, catches of alcohol and a little citrus. Not characteristic of most DIPA's.  Taste- Grapefruit still apparent, no bitterness to find though maybe just a bit at the end, really lost a lot of its hop character, strong sweet malts, alcohol not tasteable.

10099,2093,Mistofminn,4.35,"Making my way home from the cabin on Sunday, I remembered a glorious thing. Wisconsin sells beer on Sundays! Only one problem....most liquor stores are closed at 8:30 on a Sunday night. Oh well, better luck next time...or wait! Minutes before crossing into Taylors Falls, MN, I passed a grocery store with a liquor store attached open until 9 seven days a week! I eagerly went in and picked up my first ever 4 pack of 90 Minute.  Poured into a pint glass, this one has a copper color to it, along with a tan 1 finger head. The retention is amazing and lacing is very strong as well. Light carbonation keeps things interesting.  The nose on this one reminds me more of a Barleywine than an IPA. Not as hoppy as I would have imagined, but the bitterness is there for sure. Very very malty and sweet. I also get some caramel and toasted malts.  The taste is much as I would have expected. Very sweet and malty, with a nice piney and resiny hop bitterness. There is very little citrus character going on here, mostly earthy and resiny bitterness. Boy this one has a lot going on, but it's easy to lose the alcohol. It's very well hidden and at 9% thats not easy to do. Decent complexity going on here, I'm a fan.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, probably from the excessive malts. Light carbonation keeps things interesting.  I'm a big fan of this brew for sure. I'm a bit curious as to why DFH would advertise this as a DIPA, then put on the bottle ""ages with the best of them."" I mean, I can see why this would age decent (hops would fade, but to me this is a Barleywine) but if so why advertise it as a DIPA?  Anyways, a great brew. At the time of my review, it's not in the Top 100, but I've seen it there every couple of weeks. There is no denying why this is such a great brew and one that will be popular for a long time.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,BeerMark,3,"I really wanted to like 90 Minute IPA from Dogfish Head Craft Brewery. With all of the great reviews here I thought I would be in beer heaven. Unfortunately, this beer disappoints on all levels. This beer is light in color with a small yet firm head. The taste is of hops with a good portion of alcohol. All in all, I must say that I find this beer unbalanced. Here is the best way I can describe it: Take a Harpoon IPA and add more alcohol to it and you have a DFH90. Think of it as an Imperial Harpoon IPA. Not my thing. Too much floral hops without any malt balance.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

After going through an IPA journey, my tongue began tasting a lot of the same.  It's difficult to explain this beer, but I can say this. It has all of the taste of an Imperial IPA like Stone's Ruination, however it doesn't have the ""sting"" of an I-IPA. Instead it has a tamer, but fuller mouthfeel of regular IPAs.  I've had Dogfishhead's 60, 90, and 120 minute, and this is my favorite.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Leaves some light splattered lace. Nothing to exciting.  Aroma: Very sharp floral hops. A lot lighter citrus than I would have expected. There is a burnt hops or a caramel blend going on here. Very light for 9% abv.  Taste: Very malty for a hop bomb. Citrusy, but sweet. Burnt caramel, like the smell. A lot of floral and earthy hops. Can't really taste the 9%. After the beer warms a bit, I taste some honey.  Mouthfeel: Very bitter, but very smooth at the same time. Medium bodied. Medium level of carbonation. Leaves the typical hoppy aftertaste. A little booze comes through here. Very typical mouthfeel. Not to bad for a big DIPA.  OVerall, my bottle went quick. I could have easily drank more at 9%.

Aroma is fruity with a very noticeable citrus presence along with a touch of lingering alcohol in the back.  Taste starts with some mildly sweet malt with some light toffee notes then quickly turns into some clean ntoes of grapefruit and other ctrusy flavors. The hops become more prevalent after the kinitial sip and the alcohol content can be noticed only slightly in the finish.  Lightly carbonated with a medium body. Drinkability is somewhat dangerous with the high abv, you really don't notice it too much at first but it definitely makes itself known little by little. Overall still very drinkable for 9% just don't let it sneak up on you too much.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S-Pungent sweet malts and citrus hops, neither overpowering the other. A whiff of alcohol in the background.  T-Chewy, creamy sweet caramel malts, orange and fruits hit the palate first but are quickly overtaken by powerful citrus hops, warming alcohol, and a lingering hop buzz finish that lasts forever. Nice balance for the style, but almost barleywine-like in its sweetness, which was somewhat unexpected.  M-Creamy, slightly syrupy with a well balanced carbonation.  D-This is an enjoyable brew, but one best savored. Will definately buy again.  There seems to be a lot of hype about this beer. Best IPA in America? Not sure about that, but it is indeed very good. I'd like to try mixing one of these with a 60 minute. I think the result would be very interesting.

Mouthfeel is full with a interesting complexity of flavors like toast, peanuts, dates, lime, honey, coffee. Lingering bitterness. Finish is sweet flavor followed by a dry mouthfeel.

Taste: Fairly sweet and fruity, with a very citrusy hop taste. Overall, it has a strong malt and hop taste without the hop bitterness. The 60 Minute is actually more bitter than this, and that is not a very bitter IPA either. Slight taste of alcohol. I was surprised by how malty and sweet this beer is, without much bitterness (despite the supposed 90 IBUs). Basically, this is a different DIPA, but I really like it.  Feel: Very, very smooth.

Nice full body, low carbonation. Alcohol present.  This is a great beer, very malt forward for a DIPA. I think my bottle might have been a tad old as the hops aroma was almost non-existent.

Its sort of hard to really judge it.. its quite hoppy but so sweet that its almost bordering on the lines of hoppier barleywines.. pour is as beautiful as on tap.. Aroma is hoppy with a base of candy-like sugary sweetnes.. taste is similar, the hop is there but the sweetness is so powerful that it may be hard for some people to get past, which could affect its drinkability.. Mouth is also a bit strong on the sweetness, this could either be one of its highlights for some or, again, a downside for others. And we aren't talking about sweet hop beers like Ruination or so, the sweetness here is quite prominent. All in all, if you get a chance to try it on tap, do so.

You almost feel like not putting the beer down once you take a sip. Bitter up front with a hybrid bitter/malty finish that takes you for a ride. Rings are full and last throughout the entire beer.

Somewhat heavey on the mouthfeel,but not really syrupy. Minimal carbination. Not what I've come to expect from an IPA. Not bad, but a little missleading. Great cover on the 9% ABV. barley noticable.

Great on the palate: medium body, average carbonation, with a bitter finish. As for the flavor, this beer is more alive than most I've tried. Lightly sweet, quite bitter, but not at all overpowering, and while you can taste the alcohol, you wouldn't necessarily guess that it's a 9% ABV.

The ""90 minutes of continual hops"" was a bit intimidating; I was expecting something unbalanced and hop heavy. Well, it was certainly hop heavy, but the grain malts balanced it out marvelously.

This seems to have a bit of an 'age' on it for a hoppy beer (5 months), but from what I've read from other reviewers, age is good on the 90. The hops have definitely faded quite. There's a touch of hoppy piney bite on the tongue but it is very subtle. Rather, the malty sweetness plays a big part in this beer. Very caramelly and warm.

Mouthfeel is also complex, lots of hops flavors, citrus... tastie... drinkability gets an great, because you can sit and drink alone or share with a friend.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,jballeng,4.7,"Fantastic beer. Pours a bold, dark golden yellow with a light cream head. Dry, citrusy aroma. Taste is slightly bitter, dry, with strong citrus accents, especially grapefruits and Meyer lemons. Finish is powerful but clean. As double IPA's go, Dogfish Head 90 Minute is near the top. Although I personally prefer Stoudt's double IPA, 90 Minute is an excellent double.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,drunkboxer1,4.2,"I have this a lot of times on tap but this is the first time I've bothered taking notes. Pours a bright orange/gold color. Not too much head, but a thin lace that staid there pretty much the entire time I drank it. Smells of piney american hops. A bit of citrus. Tasting it I first notice the sharp carbonation/hop bitterness combo. The finish is ""sticky"" I guess. Sweet pale malt and piney hop oil taste. It's a little bready as well and there's some warming alcohol in there. It's disasterously drinkable on tap for some reason. I don't recommend sessioning it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,pmcgill10,4.28,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass. The dark amber color bodes well for this ultra-hopped brew. The off white two finger head dissipated after a minute or two into a thin ring. Hops on the nose, spicy and enticing. Sweet port-wine like malty taste gives way to spicy, earthy hop bitterness. Its piney and citrusy at the same time. Hops give way to definite medicinal alcohol taste. After all, this brew is 9% ABV. I'd almost forgotten. It's well hidden by the massive amount of hops and malt.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Bamabrew22,4.65,"A friend of mine from NY brought me a four pack of this recently. Incredible brew. Poured coppery and clear straight out of the 12 oz bottle. Nice bubble head sat atop a delicious smelling beer. Aroma was hop-tastic, piney, with notes of citrus. Nice lacing of the glass as well. First sip was simply divine. A veritable hop explosion in my mouth. Robust, clean, hoppy beer. cannot believe that it is 9% ABV, because the hops and malt are balanced out so well. It had a crisp, clean, lip-smacking dryness to it. Delicious beer. Goes down smooth for something this robust. Can't wait to get home and have another.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,BenJames1984,4.97,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass.  A- Very appealing; dominantly red, with a nice orange hue. A thin white head. Normally leaves a pretty good lacing, but not so much this session.  S- The malts and hops in this bad boy reach out, and pull you in by the nose. One of the best features of this beer.  Taste- The hops dance about on my tongue, with the malts in tow. Perfect balance of sweetness and bitterness. Almost orgasmic.  Mouthfeel- Very light carbonation. A slight tingling sensation as the bubbles brush past.  Drinkability- This is awesome. This beer is so fulfilling, complex, and a decent ABV at 9%. Considering all of this, I can still drink one after the other.  I LOVE this beer. This is a great go-to beer for me, and has been in my top 10 for a long time.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,lstokes,4.28,"Hazy bronze with a two-finger head and beautiful lacing. The smell is less than amazing, it's grapefruity, citrus, spicy but somehow metallic.  The taste, WOW. Juicy hop bomb with an amazing mouthfeel--not very carbonated but very creamy--lots of grapefruit, pine, some salt, lots of hop oils, earth, everything you can imagine. It's got that ""raw"" quality so characteristic of Dogfish Head--sometimes it screws them up, but not here.  The malts are pretty non-existent as far as I can tell, although there's a little malt and yeast in the finish, and therefore the taste and drinkability are directly correlated to your love of the raw hop. My love of the raw hop is strong, and it's because of beers like this one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,LiquidLord,4.67,"A - Appealing reddish-gold color with white head. Nice, consistent lacing along the glass.   S - As soon as I took a whiff, I knew I was in for a treat. Full-bodied citrus aromas, particularly grapefruit. The smell was also not overbearing, and very refreshing.  T - Exceptional balance between malt flavors and the prodigious hop characters. Pleasing bread tones at first, with a terrific amount of lemon and grapefruit flavor then coming through. Finishes with a pleasing warmth from the alcohol, though I never would have guessed 9% abv. The balance in this beer is unbelievably good.  M - Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the beer. Carbonation was relatively mild, and the beer had a medium-bodied, almost creamy feel. Exceptionally smooth for such a hoppy beer.  D - Very drinkable, especially considering the high abv and flavor concentration.  This is probably the best IPA I've ever had the pleasure of consuming. Great aromas, unparalleled balance of tastes, and a good hop wallop make for some good drinking. I can't get enough of this beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,GeezLynn,3.63,"bottled on 4/17/2009 Nice copper color with a thin, but long lasting head. Smell is biscuit malt with plenty of pine and some grapefruit. Really opens up after sitting and warming (I had to improve this rating after 5 minutes). Bitter flavors are a little overpowering. Plenty of hops especially pine there but too much of a flat/heavy/dense ending. Flavors could blend better - sum of the parts is greater than the whole. Great feel on this guy. Sticks to your mouth a bit with enough carbonation and astringency to seep into your taste buds. Fairly drinkable, although the high abv is more noticeable than other top DIPAs.  I've had this beer enough times with the same result to safely say that even considering the style, it's a more of heavy-handed approach to this type of beer. A pretty good beer, but doesn't stand up well next to the best in this style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Sperzel,4.4,"A: Pours a rich gold color with a thick white head settling to a film and leaving great lacing all down the glass.  S: A big whiff of those wonderful flowers. Fruit is next, then the bready malt.  T&M: What a kick! Big, big bitter oily hop flavor with a fruit/alcohol/bread malt sweetness. Hints of grapefruit and pear. Smooth, medium body and quite juicy.  A couple of these will do just fine!

S - It took a while to get anything but mostly flowery hop hint in the nose. Some malt but very slight. some fruitiness as well in the nose.  T - Creamy taste of flowery hops reminds me of 120 only less alcoholic and less sweet. A more toned down version (expected). I like it better than 120 because the sweetness is balanced by a dry bitter finish. Initially there are some sweet tones, like caramel or honey that are balanced with the flowery bitterness of the hops. Very interesting beer, pleasant.  M - Oily and medium bodied well carbonated.  D - Pretty drinkable for and IPA in my book. The dryness isn't too intense at the end and is well balanced.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Jmoore50,4.66,"Whoa, uh...this is close to perfection. This is the first DFH brew that I have EVER had, and holy smokes, no wonder it is so popular. We are now receiving shipments of DFH, pretty much just send them to my house and I will drink them up. Bottled 4/17/09  The color and appearance of these beauties is amazing. What a great bronze color. Just solid. Then there is the head, which for me poured a two and half finger head, but the lacing! The head went down to a finger, but it just sticks to absolutely everything. A solid covering of foam all over my glass.  The smell is good, but nothing outstanding. I really cant smell any overwhelming characteristic other than a sweet honey hops smell. The dry hopping is the greatest, isnt it?  The taste is AMAZING! The taste combined with the mouthfeel just shoots this brew to the top of my list. What an amazing experience. A great dry hoppiness that is followed by a malt earthly sweetness. Just amazing. The mouthfeel is great, smooth, but not before it dances incredibly all over my tongue. Overall a near perfect brew. Will buy many more.

10099,2093,MAB,4,"This was a good beer. But I've had better bitters/ IPAs.  Poured into a tulip glass. Lovely amber brown color. Tight white head of around a finger or so, settled back almost immediately but leaves lace on glass as it goes down.  The first taste is hops, naturally. What part of the tongue is said to taste bitterness? The front did. The sides did. The back did. The middle did. Kinda fun, and definitely different.  But it is all hops and not much else. Oh, I tasted the malts, alright. They were almost like scotch in flavor. The 9% alcohol contributes to that. But they were overpowered by the hops.  I like hops and I like bitter. I guess that I like a better balance, though. Maybe the ""60 minute"" will do it for me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Slatetank,4.15,"I had this at the General Sutter Inn in Lititz PA. Served at cask temp in a nonic  A - Very clear medium dark amber w/ weak pale head, no lacing and looks basically uncarbonated  S - Sweet malt aroma w/ high tart amarilllo sour citrus scent. The odor is moderately high of alcohol and he hops are not as pungent as expected but nice scent overall  M - I got the fruitiness and sweet malt in the feel w/ intense bite of bitterness and alcohol simultaneously w/ a residual sweet texture and juicy hop finish  T - Sweet - high amount of sweetness w/ the two row evident in the taste w/ a mild nutty toasted malt taste. The flavor is almost more like a barleywine until a citrusy amarillo and lemony hop flavor w/ sour oranges and mild sweet taste eases in. The malt is candy-like w/ tangerines and tangy notes w/ a boozy flavor that lasts into the finish  D - A drinkable Imperial IPA, especially on cask, but it seems stronger and more intense, not the same beer as in the bottle at all. I hope to have it on cask again to compare, but a great experience that seems to expose how malty the beer really is. Just a bit over the top for everday drinking or to be social. I would probably have ordered only a half pint next time - strength and acidity are too much for my taste this way.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Buschyfor3,4.31,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a SA perfect pint glass.  A: Bright golden-amber; sparkling body when held up to light; lots of tiny carbonation bubbles racing to a slightly rocky white head, about 1 finger thick. Head reduces to a ring on top of the body; lots of sticky, white lacing.  S: Pungent, citrusy hops hit the nose from the moment I pop the cap - huge, tart grapefruit, herbal notes, slightly minty, a tad bit of earthiness. Just faintly pick up on the malts in the background - just a light, sweet biscuit/baked bread note hiding behind the volume of hops.  T: Hops blast the palate with a uniquely grapefruit citrus flavor - a tart, rind-like edge with a lot of residual sweetness following the initial burst of bitterness. Hops also give off a faintly minty/herbal bite which quickly fades as the malts ascend. Sweeter than other IPAs I've tried - I attribute this to the greater balancing effect from the malts - with a smooth biscuit and honey flavor that plays nicely with the residual fruity sweetness. Alcohol comes in near the finish with a quick, spicy punch. Aftertaste comprised of some lingering hop bitterness which gives away to a milder, malty biscuit note. Delicious and very smooth; flavors meld nicely, creating a much more balanced profile.  M: Very crisp carbonation across the palate keeps the mouthfeel lively and refreshing. Carbonation plays well with the abundance of citrusy hops. Slightly slick feel on the swallow.  D: 9% ABV means one, two bottles max, but this IPA is surprisingly more drinkable than I expected. A lot of reviews suggest the 90min IPA is almost too sweet, but I think it helps with the drinkability by masking the heat from the alcohol (as well as rounding out the hop bitterness). Rest assured, the alcohol does peek through with greater presence near the end of the glass, as the beer reaches room temp.  DISCLAIMER: I'm not a ""hop head"" or that big into IPAs in general, but this beer is quite good - I'd go so far to say it is my favorite example from a style I'm not really all that versed in. I liked the Stone Ruination for what it was, but I think 90min takes the nod here. The citrusy grapefruit notes (I quite enjoy grapefruit) balanced beautifully with a steady malt backbone to create a bold yet highly refreshing beer for a warm summer evening. I was really diggin' DFH's 60min , but the 90min is far and away superior, even if a 4 pack costs me the same as a 6 pack of the 60min... definitely worth the price.  I think this is a well-executed DIPA - one which nudges me back into the direction of giving other IPAs another chance to impress. This is the yardstick by which I will measure.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Ralphus,3.35,"The dogfish 90 min IIPA is a significant step up from the 60 min. The volume has definitely been turned up in the malt department and to a lesser extent the hops.  Appearance wise this beer is a bit better than average. A decent head that recedes quickly to a small blanket of foam. The colour is light honey brown There is some lacing but it's not remarkable.  Smells of sweet toasted malts and fruit can be found within. These are nice but not particularly outstanding either. The taste is similar with sweet malts up front, some fruit, but with a significant hop presence towards the end. And to be honest I think I was expecting more hops.  The beer itself is slightly thick and the carbonation gives it a prickly feeling in the mouth.

10099,2093,sweetbrew82,3.52,"12 oz. into snifter/ Bottled on 2/27/09  P: Deep amber with a thick and creamy eggshell-colored head that features somewhat of a whipped consistency. Decent retention, but didn't leave as much lace as expected.  A: Smells like a lot of hops! Citrusy, piney, and some vague floral notes underneath. Not to be outdone, the toasty caramel malts make their presence known as well. I just hope it's not as malty on the palate...  T: ...damn it! As expected, this is one of those DIPA's that strives for balance instead of the full-throttle hop explosions that, admittedly, I am partial to. The citrus side of the hop bill tastes like grapefruit, orange peel, and pineapple while the piney side is more resinous. Those floral notes come through even less on the palate than they do in the aroma. That huge caramel malt presence bullies its way in to share the spotlight with the hops and provides more than enough sweetness to counter-balance the bitterness.  M: All those malts make for a body that's medium-full with more of a smooth & creamy feel rather than a sticky, dry one.  Notes: I can appreciate this beer for what it is, and can definitely see why some people love it so dearly. Having said that, this just isn't my cup of tea when it comes to DIPA's. Is it because I live on the West Coast and am biased towards huge hop bombs? Probably. But that doesn't mean that I can't appreciate the fact that this is, obviously, a well-crafted beer. It's just too malty sweet to break into my upper eschalon of hoppy beers.

Head is insane and the lacing is amazing - it leaves wonderful patches down the glass just from the slight dissipation of the head. Bubbles don't know what to do to punch their way out through the body, but they make a valiant effort. Looks wonderful.  Big piney, almost solvent like pungency on the nose. Pepper, latex, resin, citrus rind and acetone all bubbling and gurgling together in some insane witches' brew of powerful aromas. Oh so grand for an IPA - hoppy up the hilt.  Oh, before you even get a dose of those lovely hops, that heavy belting richness makes its presence felt, with a slick, thick, chewy texture coating the mouth. Once it's there it releases its bomb - a phenomenally astringent hop bitterness cascading over the tongue. Apart from the thick body, there's almost no whisper of the malt backing, but that's ok. That's what this beer is all about.  It's a big hop-bomb this one, almost to the point of insanity.

The hops, malt, and caramel flavors are in such perfect balance I could cry. So well done, there isn't much else to say.  M- Full bodied, suspended carbonation, this is something special, when the mouthfeel is right, and everything else is right, you got a perfect beer, this is it.

There's obviously a great deal of hops here. Tons of lovely, lovely hops. It's bitter without being overpoweringly so. Again, a mild floral note from the hops, but it's very abbreviated.  The mouthfeel is very nice. Not too fizzy/foamy - nearly perfect.  If I were forced to complain, I'd say that the bitter aftertaste hangs on a bit long, impairing drinkability ever so slightly.

T- Far less hoppy than other Imp IPA's, it was kinda disappointing. This beer reminds me more of a high alcohol, overly hopped pale ale. It's possible I had an older beer but the store I got is from is usually good about freshness, a date code would help resolve this.  M- Good mouthfeel, nice carbonation throughout the entire beer.

10099,2093,JerzDevl2000,4.18,"Picked this up recently because I've heard so many good things about this beer and I love my IPA's. Sure enough, this lived up to the hype, although it was not the ""hopbomb"" that I was expecting. As odd as it sounds, this beer has a nice taste that's both subtle and refined. The hops are there but they don't hit you over the head. Instead, they're present, solid, and addicting. Needless to say, I wish I had more than one bottle in front of me.  Good pour to this - clear, dark amber, and bubbly with a fairly frothy head. It almost reminded me of a west coast IPA like Stone or Sierra Nevada because of the amount of carbonation that could be seen. Like those beers, that didn't necessarily translate over to the taste. What did stick out was the sudsy, leathery, dry-hopped aspect of this. It's only a bit floral and citrusy but the warmer, metallic notes dominate more. The body is near perfect and this won't leave you wishing for a glass of water by your side to wash it down. Now that I've worked my way down to the bottom of my pint glass, I can certainly taste a bit of bourbon and caramel in this. What exactly what this aged in?!?!??  Sure, this is 9.00% ABV but it'll go down so easily that it can hardly be felt. Just give this a shot and enjoy it - Dogfish Head is arguably the best East Coast Brewery at putting these kind of beers together and this proves why beyond the shadow of a doubt. Instead of overloading the senses, this puts the ""craft"" into craft beer. While it's not the best I've ever had, it's up there and can more than hold it's own.

There is a nice subtle hop bitterness that lingers throughout and is topped off with and almost candy-toffee-like maltiness and citrus fruits. None of the flavors really dominate so it is ""balanced"" all the way through. There is a great subtle sweetness to the aftertaste that begs you to drink more. overall, though, much too malty and sweet for a DIPA. a good beer, not a great DIPA.  M- on the lighter side of full-bodied for a DIPA, and it is slightly over-carbonated for my liking.

The head settles to 3+ fingers after a little over a minute w/ light lacing.  What's most impressive about this DIPA is the balance in the taste from the start of the experience. It's hoppy for certain, but not as uber-hoppy as some others in this style; and, as mentioned, expertly balanced with its malty side. Beware the 9% abv, it's well hidden.  The mouthfeel has a nice amount of carbonation (when poured down the side). The gravity of this brew is a perfect match for its characteristic elements.  The Dogfish Head 90 Minute DIPA is the work of brew artists; an absolutely delicious brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,MeisterBurger,4.25,"Pours a honied amber color with a copious amount of head. Fantastic head retention and lacing like glue.  The aroma is what you would expect from the style, all citrusy hops and some bready, caramel malt. Nice. Present. But not heavy handed. It adds wonderfully to the taste.  The taste is more malty and much less bitter than expected and only slightly more bitter than a 60 minute IPA. Huh. There's a nice and solid caramel backbone---somewhat of a butterscotch and honey vibe going on here. The resin of the pine and the grassy citrus works well with it. The alcohol creeps up with every sip as it warms. There's an element of-- and I don't mean this in a bad way, because it tastes nice -- dishsoap to it. Really, this is a delicious and elegantly restrained DIPA, not the over-the-top hop dropkick that makes me normally prefer an IPA to a DIPA.  It's oily and there's very little carbonation here which kind of makes it stick to your tongue and causes the hops to really register and linger. It's creamy and chewy and delicious.  At 9% I'm good for one of these at a time. Two, tops.

The nose is mostly grassy/earthy and pine with a strong malt presence. There are citrus hops and a sweet fruity ester smell in the backround, but not as pronounced as the hops in the nose.  This is a damn tastey brew. It's very resinous and well balanced with the malt. The bitterness is there but not in your face. The sweet fruit and malt is just as much a centerpiece as the pine hops.  This has a great mouthfeel as well. It's creamy and oily, full bodied. Carbonation is damn near perfect.  The alcohol shows up a little, but overall this is so flavorful and balanced that it's enjoyable enough to have one after another.  This is a classic example of a DIPA, especially those coming out of the east. This beer is worth every ounce of respect it gets in the beer community.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,kindestcut,4.02,"The DFH 90 Minute IPA pours a very pretty dark amber color with a white frothy head and apparent lacing.  The aroma is heavily floral/citrus, expected for an IPA of this quality.  The first taste is very dry, a hoppy whirlwind, with a finish that leaves a bitterness that is not at all unpleasant. While hops dominate the flavor of this beer there are also notes of sweetness, however they are quickly devoured by the hop explosion.  This is best described as a ""bright"" beer, although it is a little darker than some IPAs I have enjoyed. The carbonation combined with the hops make this a nice beer for session drinking.  Aged beer review (For info only. Not taken into account in grading):  I know this is not your typical review because this is a DFH 90 Minute IPA that has been sitting aging in a closet since 2005. My ratings are, therefore, for a 4 year old bottle, aged in complete darkness and in moderate temperature.  The pour was uneventful. Not much head at all. The beer appears to be a lovely amber color, although very cloudy.  The aroma is fruity, much more than when this beer was fresh I am sure. The Alcohol has come to the front and the hops have retreated...not your typical IPA of any sort.  The taste is more like a strong maibach with little carbonation. Not the tastiest of beers but that is probably to be expected. After 4 years, this has become more or less, a malt-alcohol beverage. The absence of carbonation takes away whatever flavor is enjoyable. This is obviously at least a year beyond a very enjoyable experience.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,originalsin,4.3,"Been enjoying this Dogfish Head mainstay for years now. It's genuinely an incredible beer. It's been months since I haven't had my fridge stocked with these--when one 4 pack goes a trip to the store is in order.  90 minutes of hopped up deliciousness..I'm expecting a lot on the appearance here and of course dfh delivers. It's a beautiful golden amber with a little bit of chilled haze. There's about half an inch of beautiful beautiful cloudy head that has great retention and incredible lacing.  The nose on this one has more depth than most beers can even dream of. Simply amazing. Some light bready and biscuity malt undertones as well as a brief note of alcohol. The true beauty comes from the incredible floral, spice, herbal, citrusy, etc etc etc hops. Almost perfect.  Damn this goes down so smooth but eventually it almost feels like you're chewing on delicious cold raw hops. mmm. Perhaps a little too much of an alcohol aftertaste that prevents this beer from being sessionable but otherwise you're looking at a winner, I feel like.  They market this as a double IPA but to me it feels more like a deliciously tasty and very drinkable IPA.  May I have another?",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,marvin213,4,"My aggressive pour led to too much head and a close-call overflow. Still, I'm ready to have a good beer and I know this is one. The big bubbles and overly thick lacing concern me (see my Hoppin' Frog DIPA review), and this one is a wee bit on the light side in regards to color. The beer is almost translucent and, quite frankly, it doesn't look that cool.  Oddly, not much on the smell. Hops, sure; malt, sure; nothing distinctive, however, that jumps out at you and gives the beer identity. I smell balance and, I suppose, that's good. Still, even though I've already enjoyed this beverage and know it to be a good one, I'm at a loss to describe what is an average-smelling beer. +0.5 for smelling balance!  Taste is really where the beer proves its worthiness. It's probably the only Imperial IPA I've had that really maintains a malt backbone. The beer is further confirmation that they're onto something up there in DE at the DFH Brewery. It's perfectly carbonated such that the bubbles seem to blend the malts and the hops WHILE the brew is in my mouth! Every sip is a good one...I feel like that's basically indisputable. This is perhaps the template for an America IPA. Though it lacks the complexity of many other DFH beers, I think it achieves its aim: it is a unabashedly well-balanced Imperial IPA. I've enjoyed this beer countless times and it is consistently good.  Great for the balance that is bolstered by carbonation. I marvel at the fact DFH is mass-producing this beer. The brewery is terrific at making much of the simply good. I applaud that. In this one, what seems like 50% malt gets caught up in 50% hops and you end up with a tasty, fizzy, delicious, yet strong beer. Let's face it--these guys are good.  It is consistently enjoyable. That's huge. I think this beer is one of those to basically have around all the time. I give it extra credit for tasting virtually identical when tap versus bottle. I can have two and feel good. I can mix it with Guiness and have an awesome Black-n-Tan. The beer is both good and versatile. It's another winner from Dogfish Head.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The smell is kind of weak for the style, this bottle could be old.... Hops up front, followed by some sweet notes that i can't put my finger on. This must be old, the hop flavor is minimal with a touch of citrus. The aftertaste is sweet and enriched with malt, there is a bitterness on the back of the tongue. But I can tell it should be more pronounced. The mouth feel is what makes this super drinkable, good amount of carbonation and leaves you wanting more.

Wonderful hop balance with assertive and pleasant flavors of fruit and malt. Undertones of sweet malt in back palate.  Actually a beer big on hops but with nice balance, flavors and fruit and malt characteristics; quite complex and very attractive.  Clean, crisp hop/malt finish. An all around winner.  Also, 9% abv.

Definitely packs a punch, with a bitter end as well, but not so much to pass up another. The citrusy notes can be picked up with every sip. Not only are the hops present, but it is an extremely well balanced IPA....hops are there..yes but so are the malts, to keep everything in check.  M: Just enough carbonation.

Not as hoppy as I excpected it be, but very balanced. Alcohol is very well hidden. Finishes with a tone of citrus (maybe grapefruit).  M - A definite medium body with nice carbonation.

Aromas and tastes are very well balanced. Rich maltiness, great citrusy hops. Rich mouthfeel - not too heavy, good complement to the flavors. A very drinkable beer.

I remember this being an excellent DIPA, so I didn't think twice about the $20 price for a four pack.  On to product.... Beautiful pour, clear, deep amber, small head. Taste is how I remember; a definite hop bomb with citrusy hop notes up front start and a bitter finish. Body is full without being syrupy. While I wouldn't call this beer balanced, it is exactly what I am looking for in a DIPA. It has taken a while to sip through my first bottle, but another one is lined up.

10099,2093,LordAdmNelson,3.99,"A- Color is good-- a deep amber--but little or no head with little retention and lacing.  S- Smells great, a nice blend of big citrus hops with some honey and caramel sweetness.  T- At first it's really sweet. Big honey, caramel, and light molasses notes overpower some of the hops. Swishing it around brings out some of that hop bitterness that I was looking for. Hops are primarily citrus (orange zest, grapefruit) and floral. Not bad at all, but a little sweet for my taste. Would love to see some darker malt in this to make a great barleywine. Also could probably make a great black and tan out of it.  M- Thick and oily. Little or no carbonation. There's not a lot to keep this moving. I'd look for a mouthfeel like this in a RIS, not an IIPA. But strangely with the thick, sugary taste, it works.  D- OK, but I'd probably only have one. The lack of carbonation here hurts this one.  All in all, not a bad brew. There are some problems with it, in my opinion. I feel like I'm trying to compare it to an IPA and not an IIPA--like it doesn't know which style to be in (big bold harsh flavors or more subdued ones). This one grows on me as I drink it. Similar sweetness makes me interested to see if I could tackle the 120 the second time around.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Caramel covered pieces of grapefruit and pineapple. Apples and raisins in pine sap. Mild presence of nice yeastiness. Nice hint of floral notes. This is a fabulous smelling beer.  Big, rich, butterey caramel notes hit me first. Floral and citrus hops notes follow, leading up to a nice bitter kiss on the finish. A taste of bread made with fresh fruits and drizzled with pine infused caramel. This is exactly what I want from an IIPA. Huge hops and malts working together to make an incredible balance that is completely enjoyable.  Thick, rich, smooth and creamy. Nice full body. This is the embodiment of what I love about beers.

10099,2093,rodney45,4.59,"remember in Jurassic park, when they show you the fossil insect in the tree amber... thats the color of this beer. Smells like raspberry, and black tea, with a deep rich hop scent. If they made this in a car freshener I would wear it around my neck. Taste is very complex. At first its just hops, playing solo. Then a balance of deep malt pushes through, and adds a harmony. Then, as if threatened, the hops re-emerge, and play a floral symphony on your tounge, highlighted by grapefruit, apricot and raspberry. You're left with a very nice dry ether finish after its all said and done.

S: Smells very strongly of fruit, strong caramel, and floral hops.  T: Very similar to the smell, however it's waay more caramely than I expected. Strong caramel with fruit dominate most of this DIPA, however hops do come in but are more bitter than flavorful. Alcohol come out a decent amount as well. Not really my style.

S: I may be a little biased here, I'm a big fan of east coast, read: well balanced, IPAs and DIPAs. Love me some left coast hop bombs, but 90 minute's aroma is awesome. Nice bready character in the nose, biscuity caramel sweetness is very detectable. Plays nicely off of the tropical citrus characteristics of the hops. Damn near perfect.  T: Just what an IIPA should be... Big dose of hops smack the lips and tongue immediately. Citrus flavors follow through from the nose - grapefruit, orange and even a little apricot. This brew has some malt bill. The sweet, bready malts wash right over the hops and smooth the hell out of this beer. Hops end in only a mild bitterness that kind of lingers, not a crisp dry finish at all.  M: Super smooth and creamy from the generous amounts of malt. Medium body, real light, but not too light carbonation. This one hits the mark for the subtle carbonation a big DIPA should possess.  D: 9%? I cry B.S... so well hidden.

A: Honey golden in color with a 1 inch head that holds beautifully. Good looking lacing after every swig.  S: Fruity, sweet malt, and a little herbaciousness from the hops, I presume.  M: Full round long lasting flavor, with a nice stinging effect on the back palate.  T: Sweet malt at first, citrus follows, and then a nice short-lived bitter kick that entices you to swirl your tulip glass and sip it again and again. This beer gets better as it warms up, trust me.  D: The alcohol is well hidden so you don't feel it, but don't be mistaken, at 9% ABV, it can kick your butt if you're not paying attention.

A: A deep deep copper with a solid inch of head, lacing ran through out.  S: Hops dominate but it is fairly delicate considering how hoppy this beer is. The smell changes in my nose from a light cirtus to scotch. Really its hard to pinpoint anything on the nose other then an inviting hop oil well balanced with a dark malty afterburn that differs depending on how long the beer has been poured. The longer it sits out, the more pronounced the malts become.  T: Hops right off the bat but not overpowering surprisingly. There is a great deal of malt to backbone this beer, although subtle. Carmely yet bitter at the same time, almost to the point that it boggles your melon if the hops is dominating, which it does at the end, or the deep malt flavor is up top.  M: Excellent. Cask beer is unbeatable. This is thick and creamy. I almost want a dollop of Ice cream to go along with it the creamy is so good. Gets slightly syrupy as the beer warms but this is to be expected.  D: Well, I could drink this until, well, until i finished 4-5 and had to call it a night or else I would be out hitting on overweight women and telling them I worked for a fortune 500 company, which of course is very far from the truth.

It persisting throughout the entire experience leaving serious lacing.  S: The strong citrusy aroma of hops is clearly dominant. There is something in the background that I can't quite put my finger on due to the hoppiness.  T: Bold up front bitterness and hoppiness that is truly enjoyable.  M: It feels like my mouth is coated a little from the hops oil but it isn't an unpleasant experience. Might be a little vigorous in the carbonation department.  D: Even with the strong flavor and slightly higher carbonation I still found this one easy to drink and very enjoyable.

The smell is somewhat sweet, hoppy, almost floral. The smell reminds me of the Hairy Eye Ball from Lagunitas. Taste is hoppy, but balanced with caramel maltiness, definately has a big malt finish.

Liquid is a burnt orange, capped by a thin ivory head that settles into a small ring with persistent lacing.  The smell is redolent of hops, but not intensely concentrated. It is a sophisticated and unusual blend of fruit (citrus, persimmon, white grapes) and fresh cut flowers. It is sweet on the palate (all that barley?), a little wood, pine, grapefruit, and spirit show up as you move the beer around your mouth. Finish seems dry on the sides of your tongue, with a mild astringency, yet the sweetness persists as well (caramel, malt). Delicious. Medium bodied with modest but sufficient carbonation.

T- This is a hoppy beer that also has tastes of orange and tangerine. Very nice flavor combination and this is the reason to buy this beer. This IPA is powerful yet smooth with a nice balance and full body. There is a bitter note that presents itself at the end of the drink. Overall a powerful and well balanced beer.  Have been looking this beer over for awhile and finally broke down and bought a loosy to try. This is a very good DIPA and I am glad that I tried it.

A: A thick, lusty orange that is cloudy and semi-opaque, yet translucent enough that I am able to watch the carbonation rise when the glass is given some light. One-finger head with moderate retention. This is the quintessential color for a DIPA.  S: Citrus-y hops dominate the aroma, virtually no alcoholic smell, very inviting. I have had this on cask once before and the aromatic prowess of this beer is even more fantastic in that case. I'm looking forward to this one warming (I just angrily turned the thermostat on my beer fridge up because this came out way too cold).  T: Dependably, predictably hoppy. Grapefruit flavors quite pleasant, and you almost forget that this beer is actually bitter. Very nice.  M: Low, compact carbonation. The 90-minute is medium-thick and slightly clingy, but not in the crazy-girlfriend way. No this is more of a satisfying and reciprocated connection between beer and drinker.  D: One of the most drinkable 9% beers I've ever had.

Very malty and sweet, moreso than hoppy I would say, but the hops are big and peppery and piney. Alcohol is present, but well hidden given its high percentage. Full bodied, intense flavor.  Mouthfeel is full bodied and chewy; perfectly carbonated.  Drinkability is high for a 9% beer, but I think the sweetness and alcohol would get to me after more than 2.

10099,2093,Jedimaster1,3.6,"Like the reviewer below, I have been unimpressed by this brew. It is too oily, sticky, and SWEET! I am a hophead, but still enjoy a good balanced IPAs and DIPAs. But this one is way too sweet utilizing too much of the english malts to the point where it is not worth its price or the hype.  Please know, it is not a bad brew. But when there are many other more impressive brews in the DIPA arena, and which come in a true 6-er, I'd look elsewhere.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,IMincedTheKing,3.43,"Pours amber with a good amount of head.  The aroma is of fruit, hops, and alcohol.  Tastes of fruit and malts with a load of sweetness. A touch of oily hops are present. This is the same sweetness I'm used to from Dogfish Head, and I really don't like it much. Alcohol is hugely present on the finish. It feels full in the mouth, but a little too sticky.  I'll get this down, but Dogfish Head still hasn't impressed me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,aglose45,3.78,"Poured from a bottle during an Imperial IPA ""competition""; faced off against Bell's Hopslam.  A: Light copper, fairly clear, good head retention - head was off-white colored. Left good lacing on the glass as the beer was consumed.  S: Caramel is the first thing I smell, which seemed odd to me for an Imperial IPA. Following that I get some grassy notes.  T: Caramel notes up front, quickly giving way to grassy hoppiness, which turned to a bit of pine & orange before it fades away with some breadiness. The complexity that it has to get all those different flavors in there is the only reason I gave this a 4/5 as opposed to a 3.5/5. I don't like the caramel note in this beer, it's too strong for me.  M: Light to medium bodied, some chewiness & oiliness. Great carbonation for the style, it really helped get all those other flavors, aside from caramel, out and about.  D: This beer gets a little too candied & sweet for me. A few of these is way more than enough. I think that this would make a better IPA, except for the fact that the alcohol content wouldn't fit. All in all, I used to like this beer, but that was before I started getting my hands on much better Imperial/ Double IPA's. I've had it on tap, which is definitely better than the bottle, but even still; after the first third of the beer the caramel flavor becomes too predominant.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,ThirstyBird,4.2,Thanks to my father for providing this beer for my pleasure on my recent visit to Western Kentucky. 12oz. bottle poured into Duvel challis. A - Beautiful deep golden color with a nice 1.5 inch head that falls slowly to a thick mottled skim. Nice lacing. S - Rich malt with some hop presence. It smells full and elegant. T - Very nice balanced beer. Deep rich malt with a nice balanced hop presence. A very pleasant tasting experience. M/F - Medium but feels rich and velvety smooth. Very nice carbonation it is gentle yet active. D - This is a very nice Double IPA.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Nice and abundant citrus hops.  T: A pounding of citrus hops up front and throughout. Hints of pine and resin. A sweet malt backbone provides the balance.  M: Smooth and crisp, with a slightly dry finish.  D: I could drink 90 minutes all day. It's a fantastically tasty beer, incredibly well balanced and delicious.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,IronDjinn,4.33,"From a 12 oz. brown bottle, awesome to see this brewery available in Alberta finally. Gorgeous looking pour, a tall off-white merengue head crowns a deep rustic copper hued body. Excellent retention on the head, thick rings of lacing in its wake, amazing to see with such a high hop content.  Intense toasted, woody malt on the nose, along with sweet citrusy and floral hops. Always tends to end off with a smoky, earthy note, even cutting through the hops.  Impressive balance in the flavour as both parties are quite robust. Rich biscuity toasted malt split evenly down the middle with one of the most contained and well-mannered large hop profiles I've yet to encounter. Because of this it's almost like drinking a pale ale turned up to 11 rather than a double IPA, except that the alcohol volume makes its presence known before the glass is emptied.  Mouthfeel is full and rounded and smooth, a bit thick in parts, and only slightly soapy on the finish.  Glad I had the chance to try this, and will be going back for more, it would make an excellent session ale if it weren't for that amplified abv%.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S: Malty and caramely overtones with piney hoppiness in the background.  T: I'm not getting the hops I was expecting. The first taste is of caramel and brown sugar. The citrusy hops play backup.  M: Medium viscosity with perfect carbonation.  D: It's not bad, but not great.

10099,2093,callmescraps,3.35,"It's been a long time for me and the 90 minute. It's never really been for me, but I'm giving it another chance as a BA.  Appreance - Very good. A nice bright orangish copper color. About an inch of foamy soap head. It's really pretty. Very clear. Great lacing.  Smell - Very nice as well. Lots of piney hops. Almost a hint of malt. Some fresh cut grass. Some burnt sugar and a little citrus. A little floral, but less of that grapefruit, citrus kick that I love.  Taste - Sigh. Has some sort of nice pineness. And a little citrus kick up front. But then some real burnt malt coming. Almost roasted coffeeness on the end half. It finishes very bitter. Like something got burned on the stove. I love the beginning, but I just sit in dread for that finish. My tongue just curls up on itself. The strong maltiness afterwards doesn't do much for me either.  Mouthfeel - Pretty solid. It's got a good body, not too much carbonation. Maybe a little syrupy.  Drinkability - Not so great. If the beer would just hang out in that first great bite, I'd be drinking it all night. But it doesn't, and the burnt thing just doesn't do it for me.  The more things change, the more they stay the same. I just prefer more citrus/grapefruit DIPAs and less of the pine forest thing going on here. I guess I just don't love Amarillo hops (I'm pretty sure that's the culprit). Also, it's oddly got a pretty pronounced malt.  It's not that it's a bad beer, but we're just not right for eachother.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Thorpe429,3.53,"A: Darkened copper color, nearing a more bronze-ish hue. Plenty of lacing as it goes down and a good head to start.  S: Plenty of hops in this one, but the malt comes in strong with sweetness and fruit.  T: Sweet malt has definite presence to balance out the excessive amount of hops. The standard for an East Coast DIPA. Too bad it's a bad way to make what's supposed to be a hop-forward beer.  M: Big and creamy. Too sweet.  D: For this style, this is definitely quite drinkable. Pretty good beer all around.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,alleykatking,3.98,Good old Dogfish 90 minute. I have drank this too many times to count and figure I will finally do a review of it.  A-Poured into a pilsner glass. Nice clear golden amber color. Quater inch head that went away very slowly with nice lacing around the glass.  S-First thing I noticed besides the piney hops is a nice malt backbone with a tint of alcohol. I always love the smell of this beer!  T-Nice crisp hop taste. The malt comes out more than what I remembered. Maybe it is just the bottle I had. Coats the tounge in more malt aftertaste and not so much hops like I use to remember.  M-This bottle had lots of carbination to it which made it dance on the inside of my mouth. Very easy going mouthfeel. On the medium to light side for mouth feel.  D-Very drinkable like usual. I could easly put back a 4 pack of this with no problem. Nice go to beer. Way to go Dogfish!!!!,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

It's a beautiful beer with a wonderful, refreshing flavor. For guys / girls looking for the punch in the face Double IPA - this isn't that big punch - you're going to get a whole lot of flavor with this one - I paired it with a Granny Smith apple cobbler - simply delicious!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,alkemy,4.05,"This poured to a 1-2 finger off white head that was very fleeting. This is a DIPA that really allows the malty scents to come through the hops. I would like a bit more of a ""in your face"" hops experience, but this is very well balanced. To me, it's sweeter than other beers I've had in this style. Super mouthfeel with a ""just right"" amount of carbonation.

10099,2093,Cakanator,3.8,Stuck with a bit of an oldie 10/24/08.  Pours a nice copper color with a big white head. The hops are much more subdued from when I drank this fresh with alot more carmel malt showing through. Mouthfeel is thic and almost creamy with little hops across the palate. Light citrus and as I drink it the hops are showing up more in the finish.  This beer like many other DIPA's needs to be fresh and I know my review would be better if it were. Overall as always a solid beer.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,COBeerBuff,4.92,"Bottled on 1/26/09  Appearance: Orange, copper, golden color. Great looking beer. Very clear. Solid one finger head. Lots of bubbles. The head looks like it's going to stick around forever. Ha! We shall see!  Smell: Grapefruits and pineapples. Grapeapples and pinefruits. Mmm. (What's the point of a review if you can't develop new words? Anyone else heard of cloudberries?) There might be a touch of hops, I can't really tell... Aww hell, who am I kidding?!? This smells deeply of hops. It kind of smells like the hops want to suck my face off and rub themselves all down my throat just to make sure I smell them next time.  Taste: Smooth. First sip definitely wasn't the hop-plosion that I was expecting. You can taste the pinefruits. Maybe junipers and conifers. Maybe the really soft pine trees that you can get in the green pots at Wal-Mart.  Mouthfeel: I guess smooth ought to have been down here. Smooth. I can definitely taste many of the flavors. The carbonation is upfront, but it's not overbearing. It's actually very muted, almost like it's signing (or maybe sign-languaging to me since beers can't talk...well not the muted ones anyways) to me that I should be tasting hops and grapeapples instead of bubbles.  Drinkability: If this beaut weren't 9% ABV, I'd drink the entire case (if I'd had the forethought to buy an entire case). As it is, I may just have the last two from the four-pack and then dream on the next time I shall see the DFH logo on my next sojourn. Until that time comes, I will savor the new fruits and pine needles that I'm experiencing, and when I'm done, I will bid this beer ""Adieu"" until the next time I see it! :)",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,SirDrinxAlot,4.45,Oh MAMA. Good stuff here. Poured a hazed amber/copper with 1.5 finger head that dissipated and left a nice sticky lacing.  Smelled of caramel/pine/brown sugar/malt  Tasted like malty piney maple brown sugar with just the right hop bitterness that doesn't linger too long. Medium carbonation with a rich/oily feel. Easy to see why it's rated as good as it is. Deserves its high marks. I may have to pair this with a good medium-bodied cigar one of these days.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,brewdoc75,4.42,"An epic ale from a fantastic craft brewery. Aged about six months from its bottled on date, so I know going into it the hops won't be insane.  A: Beautiful orangish amber. Clear, with a crisp white head. Great lace sticks to the sides.  S: Initially I really get the sweet malts. I also get some fruitiness and very floral hops. The hop aromas blend with the fruitiness to give off a pineapple/tangerine scent. There is a faint pine aroma, but not overpowering.  T: Once again the malts really take me off guard. I get a fruity, bready flavor with faint tones of caramel. The hops come through shortly thereafter with more of that citrus/pineapple flavor. The bitterness is there, but is clean and not harsh. The hops are not really as strong as in some of those west coast DIPAs, but they are definitely here. I have to say the malt presence is nice. This beer is like a beefed up version of the 60 minute. It also reminds me of a higher octane Smuttynose Finest Kind.  M: Medium bodied overall. Really not to heavy and not to light. Clean and crisp on the palate.  D: A really fantastic DIPA. Not too big to turn you off after one and not too small to make it seem like you are drinking a standard IPA. The maltiness really made this one a winner for me. Don't get me wrong, the hops were great, but I like a balanced DIPA. This definitely hit that mark. I want to try it again, really fresh to get the full hop experience. I'll probably pick up another 4-pack to age a year to see the difference. This beer is a must have for any beer geek.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,McClungbrew2,4.23,"Appearance - Clear golden amber color with a creamy lasting head. The head is replenished by a constan stream of small bubbles rising up from the bottom of the glass.  Smell - Hops with a touch of malt. Pine and citrus.  Taste - Pine-resin, citrus, pineapple sweetness and earhty hops delisciously balanced with a malty ale flavor.  Mouthfeel - Smooth on the front, draws a mouth watering juiciness in the middle with a slight hoppy edge in the finish. Not as dry in the finish as I expected from the amount of hops. Very well balanced. It has a very pleasant aftertaste.  Drinkability - Each drink anticipates the next, but definitly not a session beer.

Some sweet pineapple escapes as well. Also some pine scent. Hoppiness is evident. T: Very nice. Met with a sweetness at first, leading me to believe the pineapple is coming through. This fades into the the grapefruit/piney/hoppy taste. Plays well together and the bitterness isn't overpowering. M: Moderate carbonation. You can feel the hops coat your tongue. Bitterness has a slight hang but does fade quickly. D: For me, one is enough. It's good, but not something I would session with.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

A - A clear bronze beer with a thick off-white head that dissipates to a light frosting on the top of the beer.  S - Not as much going on here as I'd hope. Slight spicy/resiny hops. Caramel/toasty malt notes.  T - Rich malty sweetness up front. Brown sugar/caramel notes. Recedes into a toasty finish with plenty of resiny hops. Finishes semi-dry. There's quite a bit of malt here to balance out the hops.  M - Medium-to-heavy body, due to the malty richness and hop resins.  D - Very drinkable for a beer of 9% ABV.

10099,2093,weazal,4.25,"S: Intensely thick hop aroma. Deeper, more rounded than brighter IPAs I've smelled. Bright candy sweetness with light, woody undertones. Fruitiness opens up as it sits - mostly sour grapefruit and canned pineapple juice.  T: Full, powerful hop flavor that teams up with a complimenting sticky sweetness, providing a wonderful balance. Similarly the pineapple sweetness contrasts just right against the grapefruit sourness, even though the hoppy bitterness prevails in the finish (of course).  I was surprised how easy it was to drink in lieu of the potent flavor! It's strangely quick, like it's rushing out of your mouth.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I swear I picked up a brandy-like aroma and a touch of caramel.  T- Exceptional. Not sweet, but not bitter. A touch hoppy and a touch malty... The aftertaste is almost as good as the drinking experience!  M- Lightly carbonated with a slightly syrupy aftertaste. No alcohol burn, just a slight warm mouthfeel.  D- I could easily polish off a 4-pack of bottles, but with 9%ABV that might lead to a headache later on. This beer is beautiful, it is really a treat to have found it.

10099,2093,donkeyrunner,2.76,Clear orange with a large white head. Some thin sticky lace and skim retention.  Smelled of pine and herbal hop at first but got progressively citrusy and alcoholic as it warmed. Smells heavy.  Like the smell it tasted of pine and herbal hops with fruity malt at first but then progressed to a citrus alcohol bomb. Not very bitter for a DIPA. Mouthfeel is oily and thick.  I was ready to be amazed by this beer and I'm so bummed I didn't like it.

DFH is about alchemy, inadvertent or not.  i'll have to compare this side by side to Nugget Nectar. not sure if the ABV muscle of 90 will win out...or the stealthier NN. not the same 'type' of beer, but they are comparable as examples of a certain perfection.  i admit, i was off before when i gave 90 minute a simple 'A'...it's certainly a milestone in brewing history.  now i hear Pliny's are good.... ;)",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Quickly disappearing head with great lacing. Smell hits hard with big, fruity hops and a rich, oily aroma. The taste starts like a good IPA - lots of tangy, bitter hops - but then it just escalates to a fruity, floral explosion of complex flavors. The finish leaves you with a sweetbread flavor gingerly sparring with slightly bitter fruity hops. Mouthfeel is a very pleasant medium body with subtle carbonation and little oiliness.

You're aware of the bitterness, but not as much of the hop flavor as I remember. Rather the malt flavor is slightly more pronounced. It's so balanced that you almost wish there was something at the forefront to make the taste more memorable. (4.5)  M: Unbelievably thick, it feels rich and thick in your mouth. The heft makes it feel like an ale of substance, and fits the beer well. (5.0)  D: As drinkable as any imperial IPA I've ever tasted.

The aromas reminded me of what i liked about this one citrusy with some honey, a little bit floral and breadiness.  The flavor is out standing, I feel as though the balance of the malt and hops gives this an edge over many DIPA's. soo many times you get the one sided hop monster(which I also enjoy).

T - again, not quite as hoppy as I expected, but still dominated by piney, resinous hops. Very malty and sweet. I would describe this as tasting more like a barleywine than a DIPA. However, I was really caught off guard by how well the alcohol was covered up. Not hot at all; I would have guessed that this one was more around 6-7% alc.  M/D - Very sticky and sweet. Good mouthfeel with perfect carbonation. However, this one was too much like a barleywine to me. I was expecting something with more hop aroma/flavor and less sweetness.

A- this one pours out a very nice looking copper colored body with a small white head that quickly fades to a mere skim. it leaves a solid wall of lacing on the sides of my glass.  S- the first thing i notice in the nose is faint piny/citrus hops. after that theres some sweet toffee malts. very weak for something this big.  T- sweet almost fruity malts followed by hops. the balance is nice. then comes a wave of alcohol. a little too obvious compared to other members of the DIPA family.  M- this and syrupy. lots of heat on the way down from all the booze.  D- this one just doenst do it for me. although it is one of the most balanced beers of this style. the alcohol is a little too in my face to consider drinking another one.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,PhilfromPA,4.22,"A - 1 finger head diminishes to leave a nice small cap that remains, very nice amber gold color  S - Piney hops, citrus/graphefruit, sweet  T - Hops upfront but not overbearing, citrus and sweet malts combine with a slight bitterness towards the end that makes you want another sip  M - slight carbonation at first but smooth, slightly sticky  D - Moderate for the style, probably not the ipa you would be looking to session but that's not what it was intended for. Certainly a great brew that is easily enjoyed.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,ThreeWiseMen,3.98,"Had this on-tap at Creekside Brewing Company in San Luis Obispo last night. I've heard that it's also available at Spike's. Both bars are reportedly having trouble with the kegs: beer keeps coming out as all head. Took the bartender about three minutes to get it from tap to glass. Anyway, here goes:  Served in a snifter.  Appearance: Clear caramel-colored body with no apparent carbonation. Head is tight, light khaki in color, and close to two fingers in height. Great retention and fantastic lacing.  Smell: Lots and lots of herbal hops! Weird, because I remember this one being all about the malt when I've had it before. Citrus, pine, and spicy alcohol come along for the ride. Very clean and hop-forward.  Taste: Bread, herbal hops, citrus, pine, and a good amount of alcohol. Less complexity and much, much, less malt than the bottled version. I don't like it as much. A very clean, light(er), tribute to the hop; similar to a Pliny the Elder-style DIPA. This one, however, is no Pliny. Not even that bitter. Still good, but vastly different than the bottled version.  Mouthfeel: Pretty flat and definitely thin for the style. Way thinner than the bottled 90 Minute. Warm and dry.  Drinkability: Really not a bad beer, but no where close to the bottled version. I think there may have been something wrong with the keg. Everyone there (all of them BAs) thought it tasted nothing like the bottled version. To dry and light in flavor for me to keep ordering. I could get it again, and I might, but it just wasn't that special.  EDIT (11-11-2009): I've had this several more times since (at Petra in San Luis Obispo), and it's been damn good. I bumped the previous ratings up a bit.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Andreji,4.37,"I stand here sipping on a 90min IPA and i'm thinking on 120min IPA.  DFH definetly changed the way I see beer. I see ""extreme"" clearly and 90min is also a worthy example- though not *the DFH bomb*- but still a beautiful beer and a prelude to the 120.  pour is thin reddish with a poor opacity to it, but not fully translucid. looks kinda oily. head was lost at once, but the lacing lasts a million.  smell is pine-ish, sweet kind of maple syrupy in my opinion. hops all over the place, however, a considerable leafy scent is going on there.  taste has a beautiful balance between strong sweet and strong bitter. nice viscous feel at first rushing with the burnt malt feel followed straight after with a mix of bitter-alcohol. viscous body (like i said), well carbonated.  This beer is fantastic, much like the 120 min. i'm kicking my paradigms aside as we speak.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Duhast500,4.85,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass.  The color is a clear gold color, a light yellow copper held to the light with a slight white head with nice lacing.  The smell is of hops, sweet hops with some piney flavor.  The taste is subtle hops, not slamming into the taste buds but gently letting your mouth and tongue get used to the hoppyness. Again there is a hint of pine and some grains feel as well.  The mouth feel is the best I have had in an Imperial IPA. Just the right balance lets this beer let you enjoy this beer without biting to hard back. Not heavy on the pallet and is nice and smooth. Some the thickest lacing I have seem on an IPA, Nice!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,DannyS,4.35,"Served at cellar temp in a pint glass, poured from a 12 oz. bottle.  A - Pours a perfectly clear rusty amber with a small yet well retained head. Very good lacing.  S - I actually smell some coffee on the nose, followed by the hardy aroma of floral hops and wet dog.  T - Unique, to say the least. A lot less bitter than I expected, with a lot of malt sweetness. I was bracing for a vicious tongue lashing, but I instead got a very balanced brew. Hops are piney and citrusy, and the malt is like dark candy sugar. Very tasty.  M - Slightly sticky with light carbonation and light weightiness.  D - The bitterness was surprisingly tempered, and the flavor is just excellent. The alcohol is well hidden as well. Definitely not a session brew, but very easy drinking.  overall - I'm stunned. I was expecting this beer to jump up and smack me across the mouth with a hop grenade, but instead it wafted up to me and vigorously caressed my taste buds like a good shiatsu massage. Oh god, I think I'm turning into a hop head.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Yesac,4.35,"A- Clear copper/amber. Medium sized white head. Doesn't appear to have much carbonation.  S- Holy hops! Super strong aroma of freshly picked wet hops.  T- Fresh hops, bitter middle, and a slight malt finish. Sweet overall and a good boozy bite from the 9%. Absolutely excellent. Should be the standard when comparing other double IPAs.  M- Thin bodied. low carbonation. Leaves the palate well, no stickiness or dryness.  D- Boozy, bitter and hoppy. Not for everyone. I think the boozyness could be less.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,gyllstromk,3.8,"Pours amber. Nose is an earthy, sappy, hop resin, with hint of watermelon and bubble gum; I did not detect floral or citrusy notes. Flavor introduces a sweet maltiness. More malty than a typical DIPA with perhaps not enough emphasis on the hops. Perhaps the hops used don't hit the floral and citrusy notes I like. A nice beer but I like a bigger taste for the price and ABV.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Beernoisseur,4.63,"DFH 90 minute. This is an excellent beer. Well balanced in all respects, it is a classic DIPA. The imperials trend more towards the malty side than do their regular IPA counterparts, and this is no exception. This beer has been sitting in my glass for almost a half an hour, and there's still a head. Amazing. The color is of worn and tarnished copper with near crystal clarity.  The smell is strong on the citric/pine side of things, but there are some definite honey/molasses notes in there too from the strong malt presence. A delicious smelling beer all around. Perhaps there is a touch of floral in there as well.  The flavor is strong, well balanced, and very pleasant. The malt character is slightly stronger than I prefer, but I would always consider it a privilege to drink a beer this tasty. The hops strengthen as the this brew warms in my cup, but behind them are maple syrup elements, and lots sugar cookie like sweetness. Far from cloying and offensive, they compose the setting for the hops that stand more to the center of this beer's stage, but only just. The hop qualities are piney with something that reminds me of the smell of white sage, citrusy, with pronounced, but well mannered bitterness. Extremely good tasting.  Medium to full bodied, this beer maintains it's carbonation almost supernaturally. The feel is creamy, and smooth.  Weighing in at 9% this is not a beer with which to trifle. However, I would like to drink myself silly on these.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,BeerFMAndy,4.32,"12 oz bottle poured into a Tulip glass. Bottled on 11/17/08  A - A very nice, sexy copper color topped with a short-lived off-white dense head. Left some lacing. One of the best colors I've ever seen!  S - The bouquet of hops is incredible! So much going on here: Warming of alcohol, pine needle, nectarine and other fruit aromas, and a syrup-like sweetness.  T - Incredibly complex. Hoppy with a slight bitterness, fruits, malts, and pine. Awesome!  M - The 90 Min has a sharp crispness to it that I find to be very rewarding. Also, a medium bodied beer that's got a slight chewiness to it, probably in part to the syrupyness.  D - No where near the 120 level, but this guy's main problem in my eyes is that the 9% doesn't even try to hide. Its so up front and demanding it kind of takes away from all the other fantastic flavors going on. Low drinkability in my book.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Casey10,4.38,A very stong IPA. It is very good and very expensive if you like paying 9.99 for a 4 pack then not a problem. That being said you are paying for a quality product with great taste and excellent drinakabilty for a berr wwith this ABV.  Appearance is clear with a redish hue. Smell of citrus and hops taste is excellent. Taste is very strong of a IPA. Mouthfeel will burn but has really good an Drinkability is scary as a lot can be had before ABV is realized.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,natasharai,3.93,"Appearance: Poured with a nice light tan creamy head that dissipated over a few minutes leaving a little lacing at the top of my glass.

Taste: Sweet caramel malt, some citrus hops, a bit of a piney bitter, sweet nutty flavor, ending with some alcohol flavor and bitter pine.  Mouthfeel: Well carbonated, medium bodied, bitter tingle, followed by a sweet coating in the mouth, leaving a small alcohol burn.  Overall: Pretty good drinkability. Some alcohol present, but that can be expected for 9% ABV. Much sweeter than most imperial IPAs in the flavor. Has an unfavorable after taste of extreme bitter and alcohol.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,alcstradamus,4.27,"A--Golden/copper color...moderately hard pour yields two fingers of head and a little bit of a neat cascade effect. Tons of lace. Perfect.  S--Huge citrus hops nose..pineapples, oranges, apple skins as well. Little bit flowery in the background. Very strong too. Awesome.  T--Lots of bready maltiness to compliment the huge hop bomb that is in front of me. This is just fantastic. Grassy hops balance well with the citrus that dominated the nose. Only two sips in and I already got a great hop burp that tastes even better than the beer. Not quite perfect but damn good  M--Normal for the style, doesn't quite coat the mouth and drip hop juice like...say...Hopslam  D--One a day is enough for me, but that one is very easy to put down  This is definitely one of the best readily available DIPA's in the world",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Magpie14,4.03,"A: burnt orange, soft golds, with sturdy yellow edges. Head provided sticky filmy layers of blobs and streaks all around. Almost lifeless in the glass, looks like a smooth drinker  S: earthy whiffs, toasted malts, toffee and caramel sweets. Loaded with herbal and dominant pine smells  T: juicy, sticky, and sweet. Malt profile is thick, chunky, and chewy with a sticky toffee nut raisin character. Slight alcohol pushing through paired with soft and ripe fruits. Delicate oily hop residue is on the back of the tongue, however it is never overly bitter. Sometimes I swear I am drinking melted caramel toffee alcohol-based sticky buns  M: powerful, medium bodied, and lushly slick. Easy down the hatch and the alcohol is by no means overpowering but knocking on the door a few times  D: I still would pull for other DIPA's. However this thing still rocks and has to be tried. I feel some of the hop flavors are masked or not even present, I vouch for a handful or two more of hops",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,jnn4v,3.9,"A: Golden brown color. Not much head, but does have a steady but slow stream of bubbles rising. No sediment or haze.  S: Apricot, peach, guava and other nectary hop scents. Doesn't really smell bitter or alcoholy at all. Just getting lots of fresh fruits and tropical fruits.  T: Almost the definition of balanced. I'd almost think it was underhopped if I didn't already know better about their brewing process. Good malt backbone. It's more of a traditional IPA malt that's been turbocharged rather than the honeyed malt that is popular among many IPA's.  M: Medium body, moderately carbonated, and with a hint of syrupiness in it. Just about what a DIPA should be.  D: While each of the above elements was good, somehow at the end of the day, I never find myself wanting more than one of these, and often I'd prefer to split it with a friend. It's very enjoyable, but just not something to consume in quantity.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Bartian,4.23,"The 2nd installment of my Dogfish Head experience, I decided to partake in one of the highly regarded IPAs. And what a treat it was!  The 90 min IPA pours as a complex amber and gold with a strong off-white head and significant lacing throughout.  The smell is prototypical Imperial IPA; pleasant and flowery sweet, but it lacked the strength and punch that elite IPAs in its class have consistently shown.  The taste was where this really showed its merit. Highly hopped by unbelievably drinkable. A real treat! Not quite as complex as some others, but a very good, very smooth brew that permeates the taste buds with great bitterness and a strong aftertaste.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Bottle has a bottled on date 11-21-08  A- Off-typical medium burnt orange color with small white head that falls to a froth but leaves excellent patchy lacing up and down the glass.  S- Is of floral hops and mild grassy hues. Carmel malts are apparent. Very mild but present alcohol esters linger in the back of the nose.  T- The best part of this brew. Hop flavor is the first thing that hits me. Next, is a mix of malts and barley. The alcohol is there but not noticable for a hop head like myself.

10099,2093,tjsprague,4.45,"I have been hearing a lot about Dogfish Head but it is hard to come by on the West coast until recently when they got a good distributor. I was really worried this beer wouldn't live up to its hype but it did and more.  It poured a nice red copper color with a small white head and a good amount of carbonation.  The first thing that struck me was the smell. As a West Coast beer drinker when I see Imperial IPA on a bottle I think big hops. But the smell was more malty with a bready sweetness.  The taste was fantastic. Again I was expecting a hop barrage but instead got an incredibly pleasant malty beer. The thing that really struck me about the flavor was the toasted notes at the finish that must come from a much darker roasted grain. The beer tasted strong but not alcoholic, in fact the alcohol stayed well hidden.  The mouthfeel was a nice medium bodied beer with the toasted flavors at the finish. It had a strong feel to it but not at all strong from the ABV content. A true joy to drink and a beer I will revisit.  It lived up to the hype and I am sold on the DFH line of beers.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,rhinos00,4.38,"Served at Trolley Stop on-tap via Randall the Enamel Animal. For those unaware, Randall is basically a enamel tube that holds lots and lots of hops. In this case, it was cascade hops. As the 90 min is poured it filters through Randall before coming out on the other end. Poured into 8 to 10 oz. pint glasses.  A- Pours a golden amber with a nice, fluffy head. Very nice clarity.  S- Getting a lot of piney aromas, much like the regular DFH 90 min. Some citrus is detectable along with a slight malt scent.  T- This is where Randall made a huge difference! What was lacking from the DFH 90 was the huge citrus flavors that other big time DIPAs have. Well Randall does just that. It adds to the arsenal of flavors by infusing big grapefruit, pineapple tones that blend perfectly with the original base beer.  M- Medium bodied with plenty of carbonation.  D- You can't get much more drinkable for a DIPA. Great flavors and goes down smoothly.  I always liked DFH 90, but never held it in the same class as some of the other bigger DIPAs out there. However, after having this beer served through Randall, it was really reminiscent of having one of those big time DIPAs on tap.

Aroma is of malt...very surprising. The malt is dominant on the nose with a hop BACKING, which is nice. The aroma has me very interested.  Flavor is a malt explosion followed by a strong hop back. Man, this is a weighty beer with the malt taking the front with enough to balance this HUGE grain bill this is an ale to go down for the ages. Caramel and dark fruit, toasted bread and sourness, dead leaves with a soft cinnamon pine-cone flavor. Wow a lot going on here.  Thick chewy mouthfeel with an oily lingering.

M - Again, very well balanced. Not syrupy, but not thin either. Perfect match for the fantastic flavor.

Color is yellow/amber not as orange as other IPA's  Aroma: Excellent slightly floral mostly pine hops, smells of citrus and definitely a tiny bit of alcohol. Makes me salivate to think about the smell.  Taste: A little dissapointing after the wonderful smells. Not very bitter, but not very complex, mostly just 1 piney hop flavor, a tangy finish.  Mouthfeel: Kind of gritty for how light it was, wonderful carbonation on my tongue  Drinkability: Very good, an easy pick for a session beer.  Overall, a very good IPA, but I have had better.

Nice lacing throughout.  S - Sweet smells of caramel and roasted malt upfront, with a nice hop finish. A little bit of an alcohol smell as well.  T - Smooth. A sweet and very balanced ale, with hop flavor, but very little bitterness. This is probably due to the fact that this beer over 8 months old. A creamy sweetness at first, but the finish is all hops and a bit dry from all the alcohol. A roasted malt flavor comes around in the aftertaste.  M - Thick and syrupy with moderate carbonation.  D - This is a very interesting beer. I'm sure it is a different experience fresh, but this is what I have access to on the West Coast. I found the 90 Minute to be a nice refreshing ale, but not as upfront in your face with hops like I expect from an IPA.

Taste is a nice balance of honey, bready malt, and pink grapefruit, with a smooth finish. Hop presence is a bit less than expected possibly due to age.

The balance shines brilliantly from hops and malt with an offsetting sweetness that finishes with a good citrus kick. I don't get much alcohol on the finish, making this beer tremendously drinkable. The mouthfeel is medium to full and the offsetting sweetness is the only aspect that makes this the powerhouse that it is at 9%.

The malts are bold and right there with the hops. Some initial sweetness followed by bittering hops, a little pine and floral notes, hints of citrus and then the malts kick in again... some more sweetness and hints of honey bread. Slight ethanol kick in the back. Dry mouthfeel but not puckering, tons of carbonation.  Way more balanced than I expected.

There's a thick, heavy, and syrupy sort of consistency but a great taste. It tastes like oily hops with much less pine and citrus than I usually associate imperial IPAs with. Quite bitter... As it should be and malty. There's a flavorful contrast of bitter and sweet going on. As I drink the beer down rings of foam are left behind.

Smell: Floral/fruity (not overly piney) hops cruise over a sweet, malty backdrop. I also pick up a fleeting hint of honey-ish aroma, but it's barely there. The hops are the star of this show.  Taste: Not dissimilar from the nose, although it should be noted that the malt and hops are VERY well-balanced on the tongue. The first flavor is of prominent floral hops, followed quickly by a growing wave of amber malt. As the hops recede, the malt steps gradually forward, and by the time a sip is swallowed, I'm left with equal parts hoppy bite and malty sweetness. An intriguing flavor profile.  Mouthfeel: Light, but full; certainly not heavy, watery, sticky, or creamy. Just the right amount of effervescence for the flavor -- the carbonation deftly carries DFH 90 Minute through the mouth and down the throat, elevating the taste and making it easy to discern different flavor components.  Drinkability: Maybe I should give this a 3.0 based simply on the 9.0% ABV, but I can't. Alcohol is nearly imperceptible in the nose and flavor of this beer, and I think it would be rather easy to put away a pair of these tasty beverages before realizing that you're feeling it. This beer is, in my opinion, a little too hearty to be called ""refreshing,"" but it does call out for the drinker to take sip after sip.  Although I'll probably never be a serious hophound, I enjoyed this beer quite a bit. I'll buy it again -- a first for me, with a hops-forward brew. Good stuff!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S- Strong hoppy nose with floral, citrus, pine and lots of caramel malt.  T- Mirrors the nose with lots of hops, pear, grapefruit, and pine flavors. A malt character can be easily found which help to balance the hops without taking away from them. A very hoppy AND malty DIPA.  M- Crisp and clean with a good amount of carbonation. Medium bodied but light enough to enjoy a few (watch that ABV).  D- Nice brew that is a fairly malty version of the style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Nice carbonation and bubbles in this amber colored beer. Both smell and taste are dominated by the hops, very floral. However, unlike many other strong IPAs, this one does not have a bitter bite and is very smooth. Hard to believe the alcohol is this high. I'm not a huge IPA fan but I was very impressed by this one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,OnThenIn,4.17,"Appearance: A nice finger of head with some beautiful lacing. It has an awesome clear amber color.  Smell: lots of citrus and floral smell to it with a nice piney odor. It has a hint of sweetness to it.  Taste: There is pretty good balance between the malt and hops to make the hops not completely over power everything, but this is definitely a hop focused beer. The taste is very similar to the smell with definitely some piney, earthyness to it. The alcohol is definitely present, but does an okay job hiding underneath the hops.  Mouthfeel: It is pretty thick and chewy with a nice amount of carbonation. The carbonation really helps smooth out everything in the beer.  Drinkability: For me this beer has some solid drinkability. The alcohol in it and the fact that the alcohol isn't as well hidden as in some higher alcohol beers make it hard to have multiple in a sitting. It does taste awesome though, making it one of my favorite beers.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Small foamy head builds as the bottle empties. 1 1/2 fingers of white foamy head.  Smell: Sweet floral hops fill the nose. Scent of grapefruit and malty sweetness.  Taste: Tastes a lot like the scent - sweet hops, and a lot of them. Not bitter in the slightest. Taste of grapefruit and flowers rounds ou the flavor.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, smooth feel. Slight residue sticks to the side of the tongue.  Drinkability: Yes please. Although this beer has a strong hop presense, it is not bitter, and does not bite. Very easy to drink.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

On first sip the taste is identical to the smell, and very hoppy! It is a very good tasting beer! Mouthfeel is very smooth and goes down easily, I think I'm getting the hang of these higher ABVs. My only problem with the beer is the price. I feel like there are other cheaper IPAs that can do the same thing for me. But price out of the way, this is a solid tasty refreshing beer!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The pine aroma comes out in this IPA more than any other that I have had.  taste: Very strong hops aroma, this beer is loaded, nice grapefruit taste, loaded pine liek running through a forest and head onto a pine tree.

10099,2093,squaremile,3.35,"This beer is horribly inconsistent for me. I have had it in bottles several times and on tap at the brewery (the best experience with it), and the mouthfeel and taste are all over the place in my experience. At it's best it is a very well balanced and smooth east coast IPA, at worst it is forgettable and overly malty and juicy. I don't buy it anymore.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Beejay,4.05,"A: A golden Orange Color, plenty of carbonation, and a massive white head.  S: Hops, grapefruit, and other fruit scents.  T: Some hops in there, but also a nice nutty/ biscuit like flavor. Slight fruit tones, and overall very well balanced.  M: Clean and crisp.. a little bit of coating as it finishes..  D: I tell ya, if 60 Min and 90 Minute were the only IPA's I had ever tried, I would profess my love for this brewing style. These two beers have turned me around on a style that I typically do not enjoy. Very well balanced, and very much worth getting again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,BeanBone,4.17,"Appearance: Somewhat hazy rich pumpkin body. A finger and a half of off-white head that leaves good lacing.  Aroma: As you might expect, it smells a lot like 60 Minute with the volume cranked up even further. Hoppy as hell, but backed up with lots of caramel malt and alcohol. The hop profile is of Cascadey grapefruit and pine. Very appetizing.  Taste: Still lots of grassy, earthy, ctirusy and piney hops, but there's a lot more malt in the taste. The sweet caramel malt backbone is very much up to the task of maintaining balance, not an easy feat when there is so much hoppiness. Pleasantly assertive alcohol throughout and a lovely bitter aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied and sticky with good carbonation. You can really feel the booze in your throat. Dries in the finish.  Drinkability: It's a sipper for sure, more due to the alcohol content than the flavor profile. A sliver above average for the style.  Verdict: Compared to most Double IPAs, 90 Minute has a lot more malt than usual, making it much more of a balanced proposition than most. While not my favorite Double IPA, 90 Minute is still very much a standout beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Pours a light, translucent brown into a tumbler glass with a thick, creamy head.  Strong, hoppy, light malt in the nose, with a floral sweetness.  Taste full of caramel, cane sugar, pine nuts, raisins, whole bunches of bitter hops and rounded out with mushy, browned barley. Phenomenal balance and plum character.  Mouthfeel lightly carbonated, with beautiful, oaty smoothness.  Finish just rolls back, with no conflict of any kind on the palate. Incredibly round at the end with a delicate, rotund warmth.

The aroma is like rubbing a handful of pure hops together. Further, of the grassy/pine, and even citrus and funky variety, but also some touches of sweet malt.  Not what I was expecting, much more sweet/toffee malt in the flavor with citrus and again the pine/grass/funky hops. Slight caramel flavor as it warms, the malt becomes more prevalent and accommodating to the piney hops.  Creamy, chewy, full bodied, and medium carbonation.  Tons of character, so much to explore, I think I'll explore another.

10099,2093,herbalist,4.52,"This beer pours a beautiful amber color with a deep orange hue to it. It has a nice light white head, possibly off-white that leaves a little bit of a lace. The head sticks with the beer throughout but it is not too thick or dominant.  The 90 minute has a beautifully complex aroma. A deep blend of citrus and pine with a malt background that brings out a light scent of yeast and hops. It has a sweet scent to it and floral overtones that make this beer a well balanced IPA. It certainly does not have a traditional IPA smell but I think that is one of the many hip things about DFH's brewing style.  The taste is fantastic. An excellent moutfeel with a little more carbonation than expected but it tickles the tongue perfectly. It is not too heavy, relatively medium-bodied and the taste is as complex as the smell. The citrus and pine are certainly there but there is also a nice background of malt that tastes almost like toffee.. possibly carmel. The first taste you get is def. a bite from the hops but the malt background presents a nice balance. It is surprising how the complex flavor covers the high alcohol content. I could easily see someone forgeting that the 90 min. is very alcoholic.  Overall the best way to describe this beer is perfectly balanced because that is exactly what it is. Not too hoppy and not too malty, just perfect but not in a mild way either. A perfect blend of extremes that gives this beer a deep, enjoyable, complex flavor. I highly recommend it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

This is a big and creamy IPA with moderate carbonation that keeps it lively. A nice building but somewhat one-sided hops flavor and good maltyness that quickly fades back into hops bitters. Great beer, it's very boozy all the way through, as the hops not as present as I expected.

10099,2093,ThirdLap,4.43,"Picked one of these up at the local Co-op a few days ago since I just realized I'd yet to review it. DFH 90 was my go-to IIPA for a while, but for some reason I just stopped buying it a few months ago. Let's see if it still holds up...  Pours a light to medium golden amber with a finger thick creamy off-white head. Ten minutes after pouring the head has not moved very much, and dense clouds of lacing are forming. Halfway through the drink the head is still sticking around.  The nose is citrus and pine battling it out, with a definite malt presence. Smells very sweet.  After sampling a variety of IIPAs from both sides of the US, I've noticed that West Coast examples generally tend to be a bit more hop-forward and lighter-bodied, with examples from the East having a bit more malt presence. DFH doesn't completely break this trend, but presents perhaps the best balance of the extremes that I've tasted. Pine, citrus, malt, and caramel are all here, and very well sorted out. There's no one characteristic that sets this beer apart, but rather a near-perfect balance of what you find desirable in the varied examples throughout the US.  What really set DFH 90 apart for me was what a full-bodied, creamy IIPA it is. It's a definite departure from what I'm used to, but it actually works very nicely here. Many brewers seem hesitant to buck the trend after a style is 'defined', so it's nice to experience something a bit different. Carbonation is medium to high, and the 9% abv is perceptible but not interfering. Finish is sweet and warming.  All of these traits combine to form a hugely drinkable imperial IPA. I almost forgot what great beers Caligione is making out there. Excellent beer, and one that I will be visiting more frequently.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Smells of hops, sweet brown sugar, earthy malt, and even some hints of chocolate. Fits the style of an American Double/Imperial IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly chewy with an average carbonation level. Tastes of smooth hops up front, then earthy malt, some slight alcohol throughout, hints of raisin, and the finish is again hops. A slight dryness associated , but not too noticeable. Overall, wow a smooth, strong, complex, amazing flavored beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,grayburn,4.23,"This beauty pours a crystal golden hue into the glass at about 50 degrees. The white head sits heavy on top with some tiny bubbling. Excellent lacing and retention. The smell is good old american hops, and plenty of them. There is little else to the smell, the hops really bully everything else out of the picture. The taste starts off the same as the smell but is balanced midway through by a decent surge of fresh malty sweetness. Very surprising, excellent. The mouthfeel is crisp, bitter, good carbonation for the style. Very nice. The drinkability is pretty good for 9 percent. It is smooth, and easy to throw back.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Prominent fruity hop aromas with subtle malt thrown in. Fruity citrus hop bitterness that was very smooth and consistent. Hard to notice that this was 9% ABV, very drinkable with a slightly thick consistency. Low carbonation and a bitterness that catches you in the back of the throat.

Rather than getting hit by a hop bomb, I was hit by an ETOH bomb. So much alcohol bite it tasted mediciney. I know it's 9%, but I have tried other beers that make 9% almost unnoticeable (Moylans Hopsickle being a great example). In a DIPA I expect hops to dominate.

S: Piney, grassy hop aroma doing battle with caramel malt notes.  T: The best way to describe it would be candy-like malt and extreme hoppy bitterness at war with each other in your mouth. The remarkable thing is how it all balances out. Right when the malt threatens to become cloying, the hops assert themselves in a big way. The reverse is also true; just when you think the hoppiness is securely enthroned, the malt beats it back. Be careful, though; when it becomes too warm, the malts become a bit too pronounced and the beer becomes a quasi-barleywine.  M: Syrupy and resiny, like congealed hop juice. Carbonation balances it out.  T: If I make it sound like all the elements of this beer are fighting each other for supremacy, it's because they are. But it's really amazing how it manages to maintain equilibrium.

Hoppy joy pulling my lips in towards the glass.  Color is an amber hue with shades of honey.  Taste...I have been sampling this keg for the past 4 months to try to determine how hops change over time. Sweet malt and bitter hop dance back and forth.

10099,2093,amneziak,3.82,"Nose: When I hear people say that Imperial IPAs smell like cat urine I typically scowl in skepticism. However, I really do get that aroma in the Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA; and I mean that in the best way possible. Along with this strong presence of pungent hops and powerful malt comes a touch of orange caramel, and oddly enough, even a faint smell of espresso beans.  Appearance: Pours an impressive clear medium burnt orange color with a diminutive tan-colored head. Right off the bat I can tell you there is not as much head as I normally like to see on an Imperial IPA. Even a forceful swirl of the glass brings minimal head to the surface. There is, however, a nice bit of lacing which at least proves there's something good going on in this bottle.  Taste: This definitely tastes like an Imperial IPA, yet it has a heaviness that you don't normally find in its class. Even as I taste it I'm reminded of the same bitterness one might expect from the mouth feel of an espresso. And while I do only get a faint taste of coffee, there is clearly enough hops to keep it firmly planted in IPA territory.  Palate: There is a good amount of bitterness here. Although, I would hope that an Imperial IPA would have a touch more luster than this seems to have. The bitterness and flavor profile that is left behind is quite pleasurable, though.  Overall: Not as impressed as I'd hoped, but I'd definitely drink a shit ton of these again. The hoppy bitterness is really pleasing and the flavor it leaves behind is quite enjoyable. At 9% ABV, I think this is a good session beer if enjoyed 12 ounces at a time.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Smell isn't very DIPA either. Complex carmel malt a slight hop note and alcohol. Taste blurs the line between barleywine and DIPA. A little too much alcohol burn. Too malty for a DIPA and not enough ""umph"" for a barleywine. Mouthfeel is creamy and enjoyable.

The smell was complex with alcohol, followed by tropical fruits, more fruity hops, and hints of bubble gum at times. The taste was more of the same with mainly the tropical fruits standing out. I don't taste the citrus and piney hops a lot of reviewers note.  As the beer warms the alcohol becomes more present, both in the nose and on the palate. A nice medium mouthfeel.

One whiff of that citrusy aroma and you knew what you were working with here, a hop fest. Really piney flavoring slams into your mouth, but after a few sips the hop burn fades and leaves you with a rather enjoyable and complex double IPA. It's about the hops, but it's also about the other things that are going on in the beer and I like that very much. This isn't my favorite Double IPA out there, but it's a really good version.

The first taste is quite hoppy, buy after that the smoothness sets in. Although it says it is a 9% abv, it tastes more like the 6% - 7% range.

The most prominent smell is of pineapple. Wow! The hops hit you right in the face. Hops hops and more hops. Piney and bitter/sweet. Nice carbonation and nice smoothness. This beer is so smooth and tasty that the 9%ABV. is almost non existent. I could get in trouble from this as its extremely easy to drink.

10099,2093,JimmieFrisbee,4.09,"Poured into pint glass from 12 oz. bottle. Code says bottled on 12/5/08, so about 2.5 months old.  Pours a very light orange. Super clear, can see bubbles continually rise from the bottom of the glass. About a half finger of white head dissipates rather quickly.  Smells really pleasant. Surprisingly balance, with the hops definitely standing out but not overpowering or stinging the nose.  Quite hoppy on the tongue, more than the smell led me to believe there would be. Even a little bit more of a hop push in the finish... more bitter than it initially hits. The flavor doesn't overstay its welcome, though, as it only lingers shortly. A few moments away almost begs for another sip. The 9% ABV is completely hidden... I wouldn't have even guessed. It's so well hidden, I almost doubt the label. I'm sure a few glasses would catch up to me, though.  Mouthfeel is very good. Just enough carbonation, surprisingly full body despite light color and clearness. Pretty drinkable. I'm no hop head, but it is just refreshing enough and is clean after the finish that I could probably have three in a casual drinking night with friends, especially if I'm in the mood for hops.  Would definitely get again, might be a good beer for this summer BBQing in the Ocean State. Don't have the 60 or 120 Min IPAs handy for comparison, but it is exponentially more palatable for me than the 120, but I think the 60 may stand as my favorite.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Smell- Smell was not the strong smell that I was expecting for a Double IPA. Hops predominate, but some citrus.  Taste- Full bodied taste. You can definatly tell this is a double with the strong hop bite. You can also tell there was a good bit of malt added, but the hops predominate. You can feel the warmth from the 9%.

Complex and delicious with the brandy like alcohol rolling into the sinuses towards the end.  Mouthfeel- Smoothly carbonated with a full bodied and mouth coating thickness.

Smells of malt with small amount of hops.  Taste is a balance of toasted malt and hops. Pretty well balanced, not much bitterness from the hops like I had expected.  Mouthfeel is smooth with some moderate carbonation on the tongue. A warming sensation as it goes down the throat.  Due to the balance of malt and hops, this is a highly drinkable beer.

Taste wasn't nearly as hoppy as I was expecting. In fact if memory serves I recall the 60 Minute tasting hoppier than this. The malt seems to balance things out well. However, there was an almost medicinal quality to it too, along with what I can only describe as shampoo. Not the best tasting IPA I've ever had.  Mouthfeel however, was excellent. Thick, creamy and very smooth. I'd only wish for perhaps a hint more carbonation.  This one should please most IPA fans. Someday I'd like to try this on tap, or maybe another bottle just to compare with the one I had.

Combines really well. After pouring, these are a bit more subdued. Has more odors of pine and sometimes cannabis. Something sweet too. T: Whatever the sweet smell is comes through a lot more in the flavor. Not entirely sure what it is. Sort of the somewhat cloying sweetness that a lot of imperials have. After I drink the beer for awhile, grapefruit with sugar starts to come out more. M: Excellent. Perfect balance of carbonation and of body weight. Really creamy head that stays around for awhile, in the glass and taste. D: A great beer overall. My first from Dogfish Head, which I've heard a lot about. I'm not sure how to rate it relatively qua an imperial IPA. I usually expect them to be bitter, a la RR's Pliny the Elder and Younger.

Vividly dark orange color with a soft brown tinge, pumpkin-like in an autumnal way, very good clarity. Hits you with a double-barrel blast of sweet pink grapefruit in the nose, followed by honey dappled scone, white pepper, granola, green tea notes, the florality a bit overmatched here, excellent staying power, amplified as it warms some. Full-bodied without getting fat or overly dense, pushes the palate to find the sweet spot where it can impress and still flow forward. There's a certain fluffiness to the carbonation, not crisp nor foamy. Sweet and juicy pink grapefruit, tangelo citrus dominates here too, the malts polish the palate while adding some cocoa powder and carob flavors. Pine resin, honey and near barley accents come next. The hops beyond the citrus not adding much flavor, just a textural drying effect through and past the mid-palate. Still, more floral here, particularly as residue.

The citrus notes are very evident and grapefruit is what comes through the most. There is also a hint of pine and some earthy tones. The malt appears to be somewhat subdued by it is still present in the nose. I can pick up some alcohol in the nose, but it is not overpowering.  The first thing I pick up is the bread-like malt, but this quickly gives way to a rush of hops. The hops definitely pack both a citrus and piney flavor and balances well together.

A little hoppier than the smell would suggest but the malts are good tasting. A very good beer but I don't know if it tastes much like an IPA to me.

At first I got this wonderful sweet smell that was followed by a pine smell. sweetness from the malt, caramel, tropical fruits, citrus fruits also stand out. very nice.. then the pine smells lets u know its gonna be hoppy.. finishes with a sharp and quick booze smell..  I was expecting more of a punch on the hop's bitterness, but all in all the taste was GREAT. I got a caramel malt taste for the base followed by a slight alcohol taste but the bitterness(which i love) overpowered it. you cant forget the fruits sweetness also. The mouth feel is very smooth.

Beautiful combination of gold and amber with an off-white head that was big and bubbly and hung around for a while and ended up leaving nice lacing. The smell was magnificent, and like I said I wish it had been in a snifter to catch more of these floral and citrusy aromas. Outstanding. The taste and mouthfeel fell off a little bit. The citrus hoppy flavors did not come through in the big way that I thought they would. The beer seemed too flat and too slick in the mouth as well. Not too enjoyable. I think it would be moderately drinkable because its nothing that you couldn't handle a few of. Nothing shocking or too offensive. Overall, a decent IPA, but didn't pack the punch I was looking forward to. I am a big fan of the 60 minute, and despite the reviews on this site, I don't think the 90 minute measured up.

10099,2093,drtth,4.13,"From a case bottled 15 Jul 08, purchased within 5 days after bottling, and deliberately allowed to age in the bottle until 7 Feb 09 as part of learning what happens to this beer over time. Poured into a Duvel glass and allowed to warm over the course of the tasting. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically.  Appearance: Transparent dark amber, almost the color of an old copper penny. Thin white head quickly disappears leaving behind ring of foam around the glass with a thin layer of bubbles on most of the surface.  Smell: Dominated by a strong malt presence, caramel, with a nice trace of hops in the aroma. That trace of hops is floral, citrus, and has a hint of pine.  Taste: Rich, sweet, sherry-like flavor with a medium finish and barely a hint of bitterness. But the hop flavors replicate the nose and still play in the background. Not even a hint of the 9% alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with faint carbonation.  Drinkability: I could drink more than one of these even though it no longer has that hoppy DIPA bitterness that was there when was freshly bottled. The changes over time have created a different beer that I like about as much in its own way as I like it fresh. In some ways it is now a bit more like a Barleywine but clearly different from that style. One of the strengths of this beer is that after the bitterness of the hops has faded with age it is still a wonderful beer. If you like sweet Sherry or English style Barleywines you might consider aging some of this for 6-9 mos. before drinking.

This one is quite hoppy, but it's still entirely citrus and not much pine. This is the second bottle I've had...the first was sickeningly sweet from the malt. This one has slightly better balance, with a nice bitter aftertaste. Still too sweet, though.  Body is medium. Pretty smooth drinker. The sweetness is pretty unpleasant, but the lingering bitterness takes over in the end.

10099,2093,kaseydad,4.42,"I must say this was my first Dogfish head beer experience last year and I can't wait to try all their products. To the beer...  Excellent heady foam with a beautiful caramel color.  Nice fruity smell with grapefruit, pineapple and piney aroma.  Excellent hoppy taste with a nice tangy aftertaste.  Though the alcohol is 9%, this is a very drinkable beer. Multiples can be put down easily.  Awesome IPA! One of my favorites.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

This is a smooth beer for an IPA..High ABV would prevent me from having more than a couple.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,SaintArnold,3.4,"Wow, what disappointment. Don't believe the hype with this beer. This is not at all what I expected from the acclaimed Dogfish Brewery. I thought it was a very good and well balanced beer. But as an American IPA, this beer is not even in the same league as the IPAs from Stone, Avery or Sierra Nevada. I just have one question. Where are the hops?  A- Has a medium copper appearance with a nice foamy head with excellent lacing.  T- Has a smooth malty flavor that's almost creamy. It had nice hoppy finish which gave balance to the beer.  M- Medium body with a lingering malty flavor and spicy aftertaste.  S- Roasted malt was the dominant aroma. Was expecting a hop explosion and was let down.  D- Very drinkable. This is a beer that I could sit down and have several of. It was good but it wasn't great and certainly does not warrant the price tag attached to the six packs I've seen in the stores.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,woodychandler,4.75,"Once again, UKBrewing (Paul Pendyck) hosted a blast of a Cask Night on F, 30 Jan 2009 following a two-month Holiday Hiatus. Always a treat!  A finger of soapy, foamy head upon presentation. Color was a slightly cloudy orangish-amber. Nose was MUCH pine-ier than the previous DFH 60"" which I had just finished. Now, we're talkin'! The touch of this liquid to my tongue was that of an iron fist enrobed in velvet. A soft stroking motion followed by a studded punch of mail. Yoi! It was even silkier than the 60"", but the hops were NOT playing around. LOTS o' hops just simply assaulting my poor, defenseless taste buds which hadn't done anything to incur this sort of wrath.  Now cue a quote from Charles Dickens' ""Oliver Twist"": ""More, please, sir."" ""MORE?!? You want MORE!?!"" it seemed to roar back at me.  I could merely gently nod as the tears openly rolled down my cheeks and my breath came in raspy gasps. Say, bartender ...  Finish? I was finished. Ask any of the other Cask Night attendees.  Cask Night saw it return several months later and this is what I wrote on that occasion:  It was on gravity-pour this night so its head was just foam that de-ceded into nothingness, just a ring around the circumference. My glass evinced the deepest, clearest amber this side of orange of anything that I tried that evening. Clarity? NE, doubled. Bright! Edison would have wept. Mouthfeel was slightly full with a pronounced heat on the tongue. I started to feel like Goldilocks - one was too mild, this one was too much. Finish was hoppy, but indescribably so - I got bitter, but not in any way that I could pinpoint.  I feel like a waffle - I used to love 60"", then I hit upon 90"" and now I prefer 75"". Small wonder that I am not married.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,zerofear13,3.81,"Here's my major concern with Dogfish Head beers: if you're going to name one 60-min, and another 90-min, you better have that 90-min IPA 50% better, or at least 50% hoppier. I thought for a renowned brewery, 90 minutes of hopping would make the most face-smashing bitterness ever. But it just wasn't the case. You end up with a relatively well-balanced beer (not really a complaint). I think the problem is that you're expecting more from it. Great sweet malt flavor and wonderful hop balance, but nothing about it makes you want to spend the extra money for this over the 60, in my opinion.  There's a lot of Dogfish-hatred on the forums, and although I respect them for their innovation, I can understand the general dissent about their brews. Nothing spectacular.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Stimack,3.59,"This brew poured to a light amber/orange color with a smallish light tan head that had very limited retention. The aroma is hops but sweet malt is there as well. A very inviting mix of hop aroma with both floral and citrus coming through, though the floral seems to be more prevalent. The flavor is nice, malt is there though it does fade to a more hop / slight alcohol flavor. Could this be an old bottle, as I was expecting a larger hop hit? I did not see a date on the bottle so I am not sure. As the brew warms the alcohol seems to come out more but feels a little too hot for me. This is a good brew but for me it does not live up to the hype, the aroma was the best aspect IMO. I will try this one again just to make sure I did not get a slightly off brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,MillySox,4.25,"Pours a little darker than gold without a huge head presence. Gives off a strong citrusy and piney aroma that wakes up the taste buds. The taste is deep and complex with a woody or burnt flavor that mixes with the hops and lingers for a long time. The hop flavor is altered as it seems to bring a good dose of bitterness, but not like I've ever head before. The label boasts of a long boil that had me ready for a big hop flavor. Instead I was more impressed by a more unique flavor.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,douggoodavage,4.87,"Serving: 12 oz bottle poured hard into a large mug at 50 degrees F.  Appearance: Three finger head that fades in minutes. Nice sticky lacing that lasts. A nice amber color slightly cloudy.  Smell: Superb, world class one of my favorites. Its like sniffing vaporized hops. The fresh hop scent drifts into your head rapidly lighting up your nose. The aroma is probably accelerated by the smooth sweet flower like alcohol scent. I can sense grapefruit, honey, cantalope, pine, honey suckle, fresh baked bread, lemon peel, & fresh cut baby grass. The scent is hypnotizing and irrestible.  Taste: Thick and juiciy very hoppy and citrusy. The medium heavy body brings pine, grapefruit, sweet grapenuts cereal and smooth alcohol at first. Next comes lemon peel and honey. Then at last a nice crisp dry bitterness lingers. A very complex beer takes your senses on a trip to unknown territory.  Mouthfeel: An awesome medium thick DIPA that I find myself trying to chew up instead of drinking it down quickly. The good carbonation along with the crisp refeshing hops is like getting your tongue smacked between fresh picked hops dripping with oil and fresh cut lemons.  Drinkability: This world class brew sports 9% ABV along with some kick in your mouth hops. A hop heads dream come true. This classy brew beats the crap out of wine when eating spicy foods. It is way more complex the most other beverages making it a great complement to your meals. Even if your are not as crazy about hops as me I am sure you would enjoy this one with a nice dinner.  Overall: This DIPA is one of my favorites and I love to drink it every chance I get. I actually judge others using this as a benchmark of excellence. Thanks DFH for a job well done!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Greggy,3.48,"A- Pours a nice thick 2 finger white head that leaves some nice lacing. Good retention. Clear body, light amber in color.  S- Berry smells, nice bitter hops, some soapy notes. Shockingly fruity..  T- Starts out with sweet gooseberry notes in the malt and just a balanced hopiness. I'm failing to get an enormous hopiness on this one, and to be honest this tastes more like the fruitier scotch ales out there. The finish is, again, sweet berry notes, and some piny resin.  M- Low carbonation. Body isn't overly large given the 9%, so that's kind of a let down.  D- This beer surprised me. It really isn't a IIPA to me. Given the 9% and lack of huge hop presence, this isn't overly drinkable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,CountLupulus,4.97,"Appearance: Gold. Pours a thin head that is proves wildly sticky and copious in its tracks, leaving its mark like a dog done gone.  Smell: Gorgeous gush of Amarillo - bright citrus beckons bold.  Taste: Sweet burgeoning malts rupture up front, snowballing into a tumble of mineral bitters which levy the booze, and finishing with a kick of fruit and a phantom exhale of those aroma hops. The sequence is bold and seamless and it feels good.  Mouthfeel: Maintains pep in its carbonation. Tiny bubbles prevail.  Drinkability: Your eminence, you have my undivided attention!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Pours a medium amber with a golden tinge. Leaves a large bubble head that takes a few minutes to dissipate, but leaves good lacing. Smells mostly of hops, as I would expect. What I didn't expect was on tasting, The first thing I notice is not hops, but I heavy malt flavor. Not bad, just unexpected. The hops do kick in though. The balance is actually pretty good. As I drank it, it just got better annd better. The malt, while overwhelming at first, is balanced by the hops perfectly.

10099,2093,tittymcj,3.85,"Bought this brew after an intense conversation over its merits with my good friend William Pang, hailing from Queens, NY. HOLLA!  DFH 90 Minute IPA pours a medium amber with faint gold. It produces a frothy, bubbly head that lingers for just a few minutes. Good thick lacing remains much longer than the head did.  The smell presents itself as very strong, grassy hops. There is a hint of sweet, heavy malt in the back.  This IPA tastes primarily of thick, sweet malt, which flies in the face of its promising hoppy smell. The swallow leaves a stinging hoppy bitterness behind, but this doesn't last long.  The mouthfeel is medium, with a definite hoppy sting at the end.  This is a very good beer, but the malt overpowers the hops. I will definitely have it again, but it is not my favorite IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,bluesoul,4.24,"A - Poured a crystal clear, pale gold color with a two finger snow-white fluffy head. Leaves nice bands of sticky lace.  S - Smell is quite different from any other beer I've smelled thus far, big and robust, and quite strong. Citrus notes are quite strong along, like when you're peeling a nice ripe orange. Being from Miami this is a happy scent for me, and just a great smelling beer.  T - For a beer novice like myself, the first sip was not unlike a sucker-punch in the mouth, followed by another one somewhere towards the throat. Somewhat steeled by that first sip, I took another and found that this thing wastes no time getting to the hops, it's not overpowering but enough to pucker your lips if you're caught off guard. As you get a few ounces in, you become acclimated (a polite way of saying numb) to the bitter finish and start to appreciate everything else in the beer, and how the malts aren't left out either. The malts actually seem to become more of a factor as the beer gets warmer, and I can't help but think this is what they were going for. The taste does mirror the smell quite well.  M - Full-bodied, the mouthfeel is almost slick, as I sip my beer. Carbonation is a little low. The 9% ABV is deceptively well-masked. Finish is bitter but very clean.  D - It's a bit pricey to be an every day brew, $3 a single. If you like your hops hoppy and complex this is great. Personally, I'm gonna back off of it for a little while until I'm a little more knowledgable about what all is going on in this beer, there is a LOT.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Piney, earthy, floral hops linger on the tongue with a bit of alcohol kick.  M - Medium body, just a touch syrupy with sme alcohol sting.  D - I have tried this beer at least 10 times over the years always wondering where the hops are that everyone taks about and I still find a malt dominate, sweet ipa.

10099,2093,BigJim5021,4.25,"it's been years since I last laid into a 90 Minute, and I can't wait to hop back in.  Pours a true amber (you know, like fossilized sap) with a chunky off-white head. The bubbles on top are iridescent. Lacing is out of control. Gorgeous stuff.  Piney hoppiness smacks you right in your maw as you take a whiff. This is powerfully wonderful smelling beer.  With such a massively hoppy smell, you would expect the hop bitterness to kick your ass. Not so. Yes, there is a good deal of hop bitterness, but it's balanced out by copious amounts of buttery, nutty malts. This is such a complex IIPA. The hop bitterness does come back into play on the finish, though.  Mouthfeel is as close to chewy as you're going to find in an IIPA. Hops add a good deal of oiliness as well. Good carbonation, too. It's well-balanced given the viscosity of the brew.  If it wasn't for the abv, the drinkablity would be enormous. And honestly, at $2.59 for a 12 ozer (or $9.99 for a four-pack) the price isn't really all that much of an issue. The problem is, with a beer of this stature, you can't go around drinking it every day.

10099,2093,TMB0424,4.35,"12 oz bottle poured into tulip.  Pours a burnt orange body with a very small white head. Disappears into ring very quickly. Lots of carbonation slowly rising up. Sticky, stubborn lacing throughout.  Pine and citrus hops dominate the smell. A hint of earthy hops compliments a splash of alcohol, along with a slight hint of sweet malt. Almost like a bittersweet peach... maybe apricot even.  Taste is a damn near perfect blend of bitter and sweet. The hops immediately attack, but they're not overpowering due to an underlying fruity sweetness. Grapefruit, peach, orange peel. Bready, fresh malts are also tossed in there. On the swallow, it finishes bitter/dry, quickly followed by a tart sweetness. Excellent.  Mouthfeel is really juicy, surprisingly smooth. Medium bodied, feels a little light in the mouth. Alcohol provides a great warmth.  Very drinkable. Well-balanced. The sweetness or bitterness never wears old, even after a couple. Definitely a must try for any IPA lover. I can see the comparisons between this and the Ruination IPA, however I feel they're both similar and different in their own ways.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Beautiful balance of sweet malts and bitter hops, a touch of stout style charcoal at the end with bitter chocolate. As a man who enjoys stouts, this came as a surprise, Wow this is good.

Hops are very apparent and smooth, yet bitter. The malt comes through adding a little sweetness. The hint of spiciness from the smell is there somewhere in the taste. Great balanced DIPA.  M: A little thicker than some IPA's and DIPA's due to the malt, which was pleasant. Carbonation could have been a little more, but I'm partial to carbonation. This brew is also a little pricey and that reduces the drinkability in my mind. What good is being able to drink a lot of a beer if it $10 a 4 pack! Maybe I'm getting spoiled going to school in the midwest on price. Big Beers are a little cheaper here.  D: For the style it was pretty good.

The aroma is filled with earthy notes of pine and citrus hops. The hops dominate the aroma with a sweet malt hint at the back end.  A smooth DIPA to say the least. The piney hops dominate but the bitterness is well hidden as the malt backbone plays a big part in balancing out this beer. As it warms it is a lot sweeter than most DIPA's that I have had which is what I prefer a balanced beer but this one lends more towards the malt side.

10099,2093,TheDoorman,4.25,"Translucent amber color, with a nice white head. Exactly what an IPA should look like. Like the 60 minute, this beer is so different that the West Coast IPAs I am used to that I am somewhat befuddled. More of an earthy, piney, nutty aroma than the citris or florals of the West Coast hops. This beer has somewhat more florals coming throuigh than it's younger brother though. A nice dose of sweet malt upfront as well. Very malty for an IPA. Really creamy feel on the palate. Again, like 60, this beer lacks the really characterisitc lingering dry finish, and has a rounder finish than other IPAs.  This is a nice step up from the 60 minute, which I gave a B+. More complexity, more hops, and a nice malt character for an IPA. It's not the first beer I will go back for when I am on a hop hunt, that will remain Stone, SN, etc, but a very nice variation on the Double IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Pine, like I've got my face in a Christmas tree and I have sap on my fingers.  t - Hops! But just enough, it's not offending or over the top just really hopy. Pine continues from the smell to the taste as does the citrus. All this hops is backed up nicely by malts as illustrated by the 9% ABV. On that note the 9% is hidden really well in taste, though I can feel it in the head. Finishes clean and leaves a nice hop flavor  m - Nice body, not too thick and definitely not watery. A little sticky.  d - Usually I review high ABV beers a little lower than other because they can not be drank all night, this is an exception.

Cloudy body that was a beautiful copper in color. Taste of mild hops and underlying malty character. Grapefruit, orange notes are present along with malts as it finishes over your palate.

The honey and citrus notes are readily present. There are hints of spice and the alcohol is noticeable but not overwhelming.  The mouthfeel is also good with a fair amount of dryness and a medium body. The carbonation is nominal and it actually has a thick and sticky sensation on the tongue.  Overall, this is a very good beer. I was drinking this well before I knew the rankings and kept going back for me. I could enjoy this anytime of the year and feel it is worthy.

10099,2093,khiasmus,3.25,"A honey stand on the side of the road in mid-to-late-June... Aroma of sunny days, fresh grass, and honeycomb, along with the crushed pine needles underfoot. A few off-white clouds in the sky come into view, then quickly drift away, and a light breeze whistles its way through the copses. ""Someone must have toilet-papered the tree yonder, see the wisps still hanging after yestereve's rain?"" The sky is clear and someone is blowing bubbles in the distance... one or two float up into the field of vision every now and then. ""Christmas pops"" is what the man had called them. Apparently resin-infused honey sticks. There seems to be some artificial solvent sticking them together, though, lending somewhat of a chemical note. ""I would have thought there would be more bitterness, or at least more pine notes, from how he described them."" ""I agree darling, there seems to be far more on the sweetness than the resin, though I suppose they were made for children."" And so it seems. An ""imperial IPA"" for those unaccustomed to them. For those with palates still used to malt-forward beers, and not ready for a true hop experience. Chewy and warming, low carbonation, and an intense alcohol character that does not seem to fit well. An okay beer, but there are FAR better in the style, and this one is almost cloying in sweetness.  ""Let's go lie down on yonder flat rock, shall we? Listen to the river and nap."" ""I agree darling, I am feeling a bit drowsy after that drug-pop... too bad I heard so many good things about them... perhaps his last batch was better? You never can tell with these things...""

10099,2093,gabe23,4.87,"A - Beautiful honey color with a small white head. Very nice scattered lacing throughout the glass.  S - Loads of evergreen scented hops as you would expect, but a sweet grainy aroma comes through as well.  T - Starts sweet on the tongue, then the hops come rushing in. No real bitterness to speak of, just fresh, floral hops. The finish is slightly boozy and warm, but not overpowering. I'm impressed with how well-balanced this is given the strong hops and malt flavors and the high ABV.  M - Thick and rich but goes down smooth. Perfect amount of carbonation.  D - The only thing keeping me from giving this a 5.0 is the ABV. I'm not much of a hophead, and I always assumed this was just a more intense version of the DFH 60 Minute. But instead of another jacked-up hop bomb, I found an amazingly balanced beer that suits my tastes perfectly. I could kick myself for waiting so long to try it. This will be a mainstay in my beer fridge from now on.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,pokesbeerdude,3.93,"Picked up a 12oz single at Wilburs in Ft. Collins, around $6. This is a beer I've heard a lot about, and have really been looking forward to trying.  A: copper/orange color with a few rose? highlights. off white head that was about half an inch thick, reduced to nothing. crystal clear. gobs and gobs of clingy lacing on my new belgium tulip.  S: Hops are citrusy, grapefruit rind, definite melon quality, which I find in almost every DFH beer I review, sweet caramel malts balance in there nicely. Somewhat of an isopropyl alcohol in there too, somewhat offsetting, but expected.  T: A lot sweeter than I thought. Big time caramel malts in this one, sweet honey flavors, and there in the back is a citrusy, rindy grapefruit hop characteristic. Bitterness is really subdued by all the malt flavors, the hop characteristic in this one is nice, but not the hop bomb, I was looking for. Alcohol is fairly present, but not overwhelming, melon characteristic pops as it warms.  M: Really thick, and smooth, big time malt stickiness on the lips, and a definite booze warmth. Carbonation is minimal.  D: Not bad, but not one of the better DIPAs. A good beer, but a little lacking, almost too sweet and malty for me, not that all DIPA's should be flaming hop bombs, but a little more hop characteristic would be nice. Not a bad beer, but I am a little let down.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

T-Taste is of dry grapefruit and sweet apricots.It has a light malt flavor towards the end but you also notice a warming alcohol finsh.  M-It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation.

10099,2093,DoctorDog,4.25,"Presentation: 12 oz bottle into an oversize wine glass. Bottled on stamp; 9/22/08.  A- Orange/amber appearance, and strikingly clear. Pours with &lt;1 finger of white head, which fades quickly into a thin, sporadic cap. Heavy lacing.  S- Citrusy/grapefruit/pine sensations paired with a touch of spicy booziness.  T- Lots of malty sweetness dominates the first drink. Citrus/grapefruit emerge and pine rolls to the back of the tongue. Moderate bitterness. Alcohol is well blended/concealed. Quite drying on the finish. Initial ""syrupy""/malty flavors seem to fade throughout consumption, which keeps it from becoming cloying.  M- Carbonation is moderately low and very fine. Slightly syrupy, and quite smooth.  D- Extremely drinkable for its 9% ABV. Good flavor + smooth drinking make this one quite dangerous in this realm.

The smell is overwhelmed by alcohol and I get a little biscuity smell.  Taste at first seemed to be too strong with the alcohol, but after taking a few drinks I am getting a little biscuit and fruit and of course the hop. Has a nice chewy mouthfeel, not too carbonated like some of the other Dogfish Head I have had lately.

Has a nice hop aroma to it, with hints of citrus and malt hiding behind the hops. As for the taste, has a slightly bitter one that has a dominate taste of hops with a little malt and citrus. Seems to be under carbonated. Has a great mouthfeel and drinkability to it.

10099,2093,thespaceman,4.35,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: A nice cloudy golden color, a huge head with extra sticky lacing.  Smell: An aroma of expanded fruit florals, some pine, oily hop tinge, grapefruit, and some spiciness as well. Some biscuit like aroma as well from the malt. Overall a very enticing smelling brew.  Taste: The hops expand beautifully upon the first sip, spicy grapefruit and a huge wallop of esters sets you off for a nice ride. The hop presence is so huge, theres alot going on with the fruit elements as well. Spicy, a tad sour, yet perfectly balanced together. I could feel the awesome warming sensation after every sip.  Mouthfeel: Exceptionally low carbonation, I didn't find myself grimacing when drinking this. It's so creamy that it tames out the carbonation perfectly. Very balanced in the body, doesn't get wet and holds together wonderfully.  Drinkability: What can I say? For my first DFH beer I was very pleased. I've walked by DFH brews so much at the local package store and I'm glad I didn't this time. At 9.00 ABV, this is a perfectly balanced beer thats not overbearing, yet packs a huge flavor of hoppiness and fruit elements.

10099,2093,taylorhamrick,3.35,"Pours a pale straw yellow color with a bit of copper in it. A fluffy white head appears early, then kind of fades, leaving just a bit of bubbles on top. You also get a bit of lacing. The smell is a bit earthy and sweet. You can get the hop smell from the start, it leans towards piney, herbal, with a bit of citrus. But there is a distinct malty smell that is different from most DIPAs, interesting. The taste is enjoyable. I had it once and thought it was too sweet, but I had already been drinking other sweet things, maybe a problem, this one is distinctly hoppy, there's a bit of bitterness with some floral tastes. Then you get a bit of the nutty or biscuity maltiness, something a bit different, which is pleasant in the style, and there is sweetness of course, but it doesn't kill the hops. The alcohol is also well-masked. The mouthfeel is good, there's quite a bit of complexity, this isn't one-dimensional. But it's ultimately a little too syrupy for a DIPA in my opinion. I am a fan of a bit more dryness in this style. I figure that it could be appreciated by almost any age of beer drinker. I enjoyed having it, and would probably buy it again in the future, though I wouldn't want to drink a bunch of them at one time.

Smell is insane. ridiculous amounts of bitter hops, smells almost dank like weed. Pretty much standing in a hopfield with this stuff, excellent. There is some alcohol noticeable in the nose too. Well hidden though for 9%. Tastes veryyyy bitter. The ibu count is definitely right lol. Excellent taste with a huge amount of hoppiness with some malts there to balance. Also quite some alcohol burn. Aftertaste of bitterhops lingers. Towards the end of my glass it became very alcoholic (as the carbonation died) however it was still nice. Not very balanced in terms of it being EXTREMELY hoppy, but its a great taste. Its an imperial IPA, after all... (dont expect balance). mouthfeel is full bodied. Quite harsh with the alcohol, but very small carbonation (alright for the style). drinkability cannot be very high because of the high alcohol content and the presence of it after a while (drank one bottle in about 30 minutes on an empty stomach and was nicely buzzed), but an excellentexcellent brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I was struck by the lack of hoppiness on the nose, kind of all malts...nose was the weakest part. The hops took the background - even though there was some really tasty bitterness - very east coast styled IPA, a nice balance of hops and malt.

Bottle was tinted dark with a haphazard earthtone label discribing the brew. This is one of the many things I admire about DFH...they describe what the drinker should expect from the beer.  Aroma was hoppy and singed the nose with alcohol..but inoffensively. The taste did not diverge much from the aroma...Butt load of hops with with underlying tones of oatmeal and fruity flavors.  Mouthfeel and drinkability are outstanding as rated by this individual. Coats the tongue with an oily texture. Goes down very smooth...as an excellent IPA shoud. I can compare this brew to Southern Tier's Matt and Phin's but a bit better. This being said, I was a tad disappointed with this brew compared to the 120.

Aroma was nice with hops taking the fore but sweet malt showing its presence. Tasting brought to mind grapefruit, maple syrup, and caramel.

Initial strong hop taste/flavor with a robust grapefruit, citrus, and lemon/orange flavor. Not too malty and not too sweet which creates a very nice balance to this high powered offering. This is a big beer (alcohol / hops) that goes down like a session beer. One of the smoothest double IPA beers that I have ever tasted!  M - Mouth feel is very good with moderate carbonation present on the first taste. Hints of grapefruit, pine, hops, and alcohol are present but not overwhelming in any direction.

10099,2093,StarlightSeraph,3.78,"Poured into a goblet  Appearance: Poured a beautiful dark golden color, with hints of copper. One-finger thick head that dissipated pretty quickly, but left a thin ribbon floating throughout the entire glass. Decent bit of lacing.  Smell: Mmmmm...hops. Lots of them. As I poured, I could smell the hops without getting that close to the glass. Hints of citrus, especially grapefruit, which become more prevalent as the beer warms and the initial hop blast passes.  Taste: A hop explosion off of the first sip. The hop taste dominates, with a bare hint of citrus in the background. Can't really taste too much beyond the hops. The hop taste lingers for awhile in the aftertaste. As the beer warms, hints of malt and grapefruit become more prevalent.  Mouthfeel: Nicely carbonated, with a solid amount of body.  Drinkability: Very easily drinkable...but to me, it doesn't taste like an Imperial/Double. There is no way I would suspect this was 9.0% APV. I could easily put a few of these down. The only hint of the high APV is the nice warming sensation it leaves as it goes down.  It's a good beer, and definitely has more of a typical IPA character than the DFH 60 minute does. However, it tastes just like a regular IPA to me, not a double. There are plenty of other IPAs that would give me more bang for my buck. That being said, I did thoroughly enjoy this beer, and it is another quality beer from DFH.  EDIT 12/25/2008: I had another one today, and it was an entirely different taste than the 90 minute I based my review on. It was a much more balanced IPA, with a LOT more malt sweetness coming through.

Taste: at 9 percent abv I would expect a little more kick. Goes down very smooth with just a great blend of hops. I have now had over 50 bottles of this and have never been disappointed. I recommend doing what I call the bubble suck* on the first taste to really break open the flavors.

It's so big in every way. The variety of flavor in this is unbelievable. Of course orangy, piney, maple syrup bits. As well as spicy breadiness that sticks to your tastebuds.

Taste: Citrus-y hops with a touch of dark fruits/raisin, but well-balanced with sweet malts. The alcohol is present but well-hidden. The finish is very dry and spicy.

Impressive retention and lacing throughout the glass.  Citrus and sweet tones dominate this beer with some caramel mild undertones. Very pleasing  Tastes like a good IPA should, although with such a strong ABV I was expecting more of a ""hop bomb"". This is not the case and the result is a very well-rounded beer.  Nice carbonation and lingering head makes for a very impressive drinking beer. The 9% ABV is not overwhelming and could easily pass off for a beer in the 7% range. I would easily recommend this beer for anyone wishing to experience a great example of an IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Smell: Citrus, slight lemon and earthiness  Taste: Let me just say I am from California and I love West Coast IPA, in my opinion this does not beat that West Coast IPA taste. Bold flavor, syrupy, tangent, nice flavor.  Mouthful Slightly pungent gives senses to nose.  Drinkability: Be careful alcohol is hard to taste very drinkabe for high alc. content  I still like my West Coast IPA's a bit more but this is a very nice beer.

Now two years latter i am trying it again no being a full blown ""hophead."" It is a very tasty beer with a high alcohol content; i wouldn't drink too many in one sitting. I have to say though for the price for a bottle, i think there are comparable alternatives. However, this is a very enjoyable beer and certainly worth drinking.

S: rich with citrus and pine, alcohol and caramel.  T: The initial flavor was dry and spicy caramel, with a big citrus and pine hopping brought to live by the lively carbonation factor. The beer finishes spicy and dry with a floral hopping, a strong caramel presence as well some spicy alcohol fusels. The hopping and alcohol warming provide a nice lingering bitterness and warming to the finish.  M: A warm dry spicy alcohol gently warms up the mouthful with a puckering bitterness of dry floral.  D: A big hoppy treat balanced nicely against a huge sweet malty grain bill makes this a great drinking ipa with the abv% covered up rather nicely.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Had a small head that left a nice layer with good lacing throughout the session.  Smell: sweet hops came through with nice fruitiness. Really fresh smelling with pinpoint aromas.  Taste: Is this beer really 9 percent abv? It holds the alcohol very well. Great tasting IPA with very noticable but smooth hops. Not over hopped like some of the double IPAs out there. Great strength of smooth hops and fruitiness. Very smooth, perfect carbonation.  Mouthfeel: Again, it was very very smooth, especially for 9 percent abv. Great flavors that lasted well after each sip. Nice viscosity.  Drinkability: This beer tastes, looks and smells delicious. The danger is that its so high in ABV and its hidden so well that have a few of these can really catch up. I had 2 at the office tonight and it was enough to give me a serious buzz. This is a beer everyone needs to try so they can have a benchmark for what american double IPAs should taste like.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Small head with excellent retention and intricate lacing throughout the drink.  S: Fruity, piney hops. Sweet malts and alcohol come through.  T: Piney and citrusy hops dominate, but are well balanced with spice, sweetness, and alcohol. None of the flavors dominate, making it a very well-rounded brew.  M: Full bodied, good carbonation.  D: I'm not a hophead and I don't really seek out IPAs. I wouldn't buy this again (bottled) due to the price, but if I saw it on tap I'd make it a point to order it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S: Muted hop aroma with notes of tropical fruit... mango, a hint of pineapple. Some sweetness and a bit of grain are also apparent.  T: Smooth and surprisingly malty up front. The hops show up in the middle as a bold note of mint spiciness and maybe a hint of orange zest. There is a decent bitter bite late, but nothing like the knock-your-socks-off west coast DIPAs. Very well balanced throughout!  M: A hefty dose of unfermented sugars keeps this one meaty enough to balance 90 minutes of hop additions. Moderate carbonation is just right for this beer.

Taste: A nice toasted malt backbone with a hint of sweet bread yeast, citrus, esters, and resin. There are notes of bananas, tart apples, diacetyl, and leather.  Overall: So far this is one of the best IPA that I have tried. It has a complex character, but is seems so simple. It has a powdery astringent mouth feel.

Excellent.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,jonziefle,4.73,"Appearance: Poured a beautiful reddish amber. Minimal off-white head with excellent retention of the remaining head and good lacing.  Smell: Very intense fragrance of fruity hops. Some piney scents, sweetness, and some of the alcohol (9%) are also evident.  Taste: Very intense hoppy flavor, but not overwhelming. The bitterness of the fruity hops is balanced well with a good amount of sweetness. The piney flavor comes out also, along with a slight spiced flavor. The alcohol is definitely present, but not overwhelming.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied beer. The sweetness and the fullness give it a slight syrupy feel, not in a bad way at all. The hop oils are definitely present as well.  Drinkability: Pretty much the standard by which all other IPAs are measured in my book. Excellent, flavorful hops without being too bitter, mixed in with a good amount of sweetness and fullness balance the beer very well. A very good beer to enjoy slowly and in moderation, however, as the fullness, hoppiness, and ABV make it hard to drink too many in one sitting.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Smell: Incredible hoppy punch and malty wave to mellow it out. This is what I think of when I think of an IPA.  Taste: This definitely packs a wallop with the hops! I love it! However, they didn't skimp on the malts. Very sweet citrus and some pine. Excellent.  Mouthfeel: I would say it has a full body and is kind of buttery. Good alcohol warming. Perfect carbonation.  Drinkability: This is one of the few beers that I think tastes better when its colder. I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as it warmed as it started to seem like a little too much.

When you start drinking it... you will immediately realize it's not ""socializing"" beer (aka party beer). It's ""sit and relax"" kind of beer. One to take your time and enjoy. The taste jumps off the page, hitting with early with a rich of hops and finishing smooth with a malty finish. It hides it's high alcohol content well. The mouth feel is silky smooth and, yet, robust. As far as I'm concern, this may be the best beer on the market.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Perfume, wood, resin and sugar are present in the nose. It is medium bodied and reasonably smooth. The flavor is very resiny with a round sweetness. It tastes medicinal, minty... maybe a bit of oak?

Lacing left from the head is seawater sponge. Smell of a dark malt with woody hops. Taste is sweet, super well balanced for an IIPA, not overly hoppy on my palette at all.

So much going on I can't really describe it all.  Mouthfeel is full and frothy.  Just way too much going on for me to find this refreshing and want another. This is an odd brew indeed.

Big time hop aroma, as was expected, grapefruit is the main player here followed up by subtle pineyness. The hops and malt have a great balance in the taste, with the spicy-pine and citrus wining out, finished with a small alcohol burn. A thick medium body brew with moderate carbonation.

Flavor is hoppy, obviously. If you love hops, you'll love this beer, but there's more there. The beauty to this beer is the super complex taste under the hops. Lots and lots of different fruits, lots of good aftertastes. This beer is just a pleasure to drink. Update (06.28.08) - This beer is overpowering, in a good way. Having this after a token American light beer is a kick in the junk, to relate it to the average American male. It gets in your head, your stomach, and your taste buds.

Taste: Big flavor with citrusy hops, balanced with malts, pine spicyness, etc. Finish has a bit of alcohol in the taste, but is also nicely tangy.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied yet with a rather hearty, dense feel. Moderate carbonation.  Drinkability: Quite drinkable, despite the high ABV. The alcohol in the taste is the only distracting factor, but at least that flavor found in conjunction with other tastes.  Excellent and solid Double IPA; too bad this is so hard to find here in Southern California!

Appearance is a thick amber with (as I poured it) about an inch of head. Used a Harpoon IPA pint glass. Clearly smells of hops and a sweet bit of malt. Has a rich warming taste, a bit sweet, with hops and you can't miss the alcohol, though it doesn't stand out. The deliciousness stays in the mouth a bit after each sip.

T - Supremely balanced for a DIPA. Starts off with strong hop flavor, grapefruit with perhaps a hint of pineapple and lemon and orange zest. Assertive, sweet maltiness stands out in the middle of the palate. Caramel, toffee, and some estery qualities. I can't be certain, but I think I taste some nectarine. Plenty of hoppy bitterness rounds out the taste, although it's not as lingering as others of the style.  M - Medium- to full-bodied and good, but not too much, carbonation to play up the acidity of the citrus flavors.  D - Delicious, but intoxicating. I can't ever drink more than one these days.

Detected notes of toasty almond and tasted what was a surprisingly smooth beer - and, even more surprising, not at all hoppy. Could have passed for a sessional - at this high abv even!

Slow moving carbonation pillars. Head dissipates to a dusting and a thick ring. Leaves really nice lacing on the glass but disappears over time.  S: You can smell the hops from a distance. Nice strong alcohol, caramel malt and floral hops - a little piney. Quite sophisticated. Not too aggressive.  T: Ding ding ding. We have a winner. It is a cold, wet day with a turkey pot pie cooking - just the perfect drink. It's very warming. I can't say the alcohol is well masked but it isn't harming the experience either. The drink has a very sweet malt start followed by a tangy biting hop. It then turns back to a more bready malt, a little soapiness and retains some of the hop bitterness in the aftertaste. Nice progression.  M: The mouthfeel is full, round and syrupy - certainly fuller than you would expect. It is pretty smooth except for some tongue prickling from the light carbonation and the hop bite on the palette. A very satisfying drink.  D: This is a pretty well balanced brew. The hops are big but the solid malt backbone just really keeps it in check. Not designed to be a session beer but it is very easy to drink.

Hoppy is pretty much the only way to describe it, but there are hints of subtle fruit flavors. Not an exceptionally strong smell, but the hops definitely come through and are the forefront of the smell.  T - Initial taste is quite hoppy but not too much to be off-putting. You can get a taste of the fruity flavor that's present in the smell, as well as the alcohol content coming through. Aftertaste is slightly bitter, and has a nice dry finish, which was expected in this beer. Aftertaste also did not have any of the slight fruity flavor of the initial taste.  M - Not too heavy on the carbonation, and smoother than I expected. Goes down nice and leaves your mouth with a pleasant bitter hoppy taste as it is being drunk.  D - Very drinkable if you are having a bottle or two. Is relatively smooth and the taste is very good if you are a fan of hops. Beyond one or two it loses points in drinkability only because of the slightly high drinkability. It's not a beer you want to down a bunch of.

Dogfish Head is a masterful brewery and I dearly wish that they would distribute more styles out to California. This beer pours a beautiful amber with a fine sticky head. It smells just exquisite. It's sweet and oily with hops. The hops are citric but smoother than most hop bills on a DIPA. There's also better balancing malt than some competitors. The beer is honey sweet and floral with bittersweet finish that hits the spot. The feel is like a gentle surf breaking on your tongue. It's just fantastic beer.

S-Distinctly hoppy in smell, though hints of citrus.  T-Starts sharply bitter with the hops taking center stage. This is shortly followed with a strong and almost bready malty flavor, and citrus tones. It finishes with a hint of alcohol, just dry enough to remind you of its potency.  MF-Medium bodied feel with enough carbonation to give it an almost creamy feel.  D-A very well balanced beer with a strong malt backbone that stands up to the 90 minutes of hopping.

A - Pours a hazy burnt orange with a thin white head that dissipates with the first sip but leaves a sticky lacing on the inside of the glass.  S - Hits the nose with a piney hop scent combined with bready malt, yeast, citrus and grapefruit notes accompanied by a general estery fruity note. All mixes very well.  T - Enters the palate with a nice smack of fresh and bitter hops followed by notes of citrus fruit in the background and more bready malt than I expected, which becomes more noticeable as it warms. Oily hops are obviously present through the sip, along with a hint of alcohol, all leaving a hint of a dry finish.  MF - A nice amount of carbonation with a more medium-bodied feel, although a slight bit heavier than other DIPA's I've tasted.  D - The malt balances with the hops well making this less of a hop bomb than I was expecting, however, it still retains the hop background. A pretty drinkable beer save for the ABV.  Notes - I was expecting more hops and less malt due to the fact that it's a DIPA, however, this is a surprisingly well-balanced brew. I really liked the 60 minute, but I had that a while ago, so it would be nice to do a side-by-side tasting of 60, 90 and 120. That might leave me on the floor, but the 120 is ready in basement for when the time comes.

Served in a ball-shape glass (Delirium Tremens), once poored, it presented itself with an orange colour an a medium white head that disapeared in about 2 minutes, leaveing a small lace around the glass. The nose as a citrus note, less then its little sister the 60 minute. I would say that a tangerine smell is predominant, but you can find raisins notes. A lot less pine smell the 60 minute, but still present. Carbonation is more delicate so that it's feels creamier in mouth.

10099,2093,Kadonny,4.32,"This was a special DFH 90 Minute beer that I was lucky enough to try at Capones DFH event. Capones had the DFH Randall hooked up to this. For those that don't know about the Randall, it's a device where the beer filters through a vat of hops to impart more hop flavor and aroma to the beer. This day the Randall had cascade hops in it.  A: An dark orange/brown color with a slight off white fluffy head. Lacing was big and chunky and sat on the side of the glass.  S: Citrus and pine/floral notes come pounding forward. Wow, much hoppier nose than a regular 90 minute due to the Randall. Sweet malt undertones.  T: Citrus and pine flavor hops with a malt caramel sweetness. This beer was so creamy smooth and the hops are more pronounced than from the bottle. Is this due to the Randall or just due to the fact that it is so very fresh. I think a bit of both. Bitterness in the middle, sweetness at the end and bitterness lingering on the finish. Such a great beer.  M: Full and creamy with a twinge of alcohol. Again, I got more alcohol in the bottle. This beer was creamy smooth but with bitterness. Nice.  D: Unfortunately drinkability is pretty high. Why do I say that? Because this went down so smoothly that you can easily drink a couple of these and soon thereafter be laying on the floor.  Overall what an experience with the Randall. I'm so glad I got to try it, it is something I will never forget. If you get a chance where the Randall is running, get there and try it. DFH and Capones is a great match.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Fresh, fresh smell - even after hangin out in my fridge for a good 6 months. Reminds me of camping in the woods - pine needles surrounding a slightly musty tent.  Slightly medicinal alcohol burn - rye and barley finished off with a sweet, somewhat fruity quality.  Really smooth mouthfeel with a d'rye' finish.  Pretty darn nice overall.

10099,2093,ironlung,4.2,"This beer started appering in so.cal early this year. The first few 4-packs I got my paws on were great. The next few however; were a whole differnt story...Just butterscotch malt! This review is from a four pack I picked-up late October @ BevMo in Novato Ca.  A: Deep Amber. No haze or head for that matter. Minimal lacing.  S: Hop-bomb. Maybe some malt, but very difficult to make certin. Just some sweetness comes through all that pine.  T:I'm used to this beer. That being said; at first it blew me away a few months ago. Now it's just what I expect. Very nice double, not as nice as say an elder or knuckle.  M: Sticky. Coats your mouth and stays. A dominating brew. No crispness.  D: I like this beer as a night-cap. I can't drink this as much as other doubles out there.

T - Hops with serious backbone to cover the intense full-flavored hoppage. A wallop of flavors and taste  M - Thicker more creamy mouthfeel, as appropriate for this beer.  D - It depends on your definition of drinkabilty. Based on style, this ia a great drinking DIPA.

10099,2093,bonkers,4.47,"I poured a 12 ounce bottle into my SA pint glass. It pours a hazy copper with a fomy head. The head does not stick around long, but leaves nice rings around the glass. The smell is like a fresh Christmas tree, yet not too overpowering. The beer is heavy on pine notes through the entire palate. The finish is leaves an oily sweetness on the tongue. The beer has medium body, and average carbonation for the style. 90 minute is suprisingly drinkable for the amount of hops in every sip. This is one of my all time favorites, and it never disappoints!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,RodBurg,2.54,"Found this in a four pack at Old Town Liquor in Temecula. I'm assuming it was pretty fresh because I pulled it off a pallet that had just been rolled out onto the floor. Now to the beer. Pours a very dark golden color, slightly hazy, decent tan head and lacing. I can tell this stuff is thick just by looking at it.  Initial smell is surprising. I'm expecting to get smacked across the face with hops but instead get hit with a heavy caramel-malt scent. With a few more whiffs I can pick out the hops.  Tastes of strong caramel and biscuity malt and alcohol. Has a thick, syrupy mouthfeel. Bitter finish.  I'm still trying to figure out where all the hops are in this. Not very drinkable and the heavy malt sweetness is very unbalanced. I personally don't think this should be called an IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,Soneast,3.68,"Pours nice and clear, the color of a slightly aged penny. Has two finger widths of off-white head that starts out pretty bubbly and then creams up to a nice layer which leaves some nice lacing on the glass. Good amount of bubbles cascade up the side of the glass.  The scent has an earthy characteristic to it which is hard to pinpoint. A pretty pungent citrucy scent in the background. Detect some toffee in there as well.  A delightful toasted nut flavor, very earthy delicious hop bitterness with a load of citrus flavors and a mild sweetness throughout.  The beer appears pretty medium bodied but it has thickness to it that sticks with ya, although the relatively high carbonation makes this quite a refreshing beer, especially considering the ABV which is very well hidden. This could be dangerous, as I really enjoy the beer, but it wouldn't take much to be ""one too many"".",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,thekevlarkid,4.41,"There are those who contend this is THE best IPA being made in the United States these days. Such a bold claim had to be vindicated. Off a tap in Bar Harbor Maine this beer was a deep orange color with perfect clarity. The head was off-white with a slightly yellow tint. Very good retention and nice lacing. The aroma was very aggressively hoppy, big notes of pine and citrus with some resin behind that. The flavors followed suit but were better balanced. Deep and complex hops with a pale malt backbone in the middle. The hops make the beer distinctly bitter but not much so though the finish was a little oily. The carbonation was spot-on, the body medium to full and the mouthfeel excellent. To claim any beer is the best of its kind is rather pretentious but I had to admit this was definitely one of THE best IPA's I've ever had.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Piney hops on the nose with a funky sweet bread/nut note that I have not detected in other DIPA's. The taste is very smooth - the hops commingle perfectly with the malt to keep this beer well balanced, especially given its high ABV. Finishes long, with great lingering bitterness from the hops. A bit of alcohol pokes through at this point to add depth and warmth. Good carbonation and a medium body add to the great drinkability of this brew. Glad to have finally tried my first Dogfish.

10099,2093,Offa,4.85,"This is an outstanding, rich double IPA that comes off as a nicely hoppy, lighter take on a barleywine (with some character elements reminiscent of Young's Old Nick or a much stronger Fuller's 1845).  Amber, it has a very big light tan head that slowly shrinks and leaves a permanent foamy top and a little weak lace.  The aroma is rich, caramelly fruit, bread crust, raisin, light grapefruit, some hay, dry leaves, candy.  The taste is interesting, sweet, spiceym and bitter, with flavours developing dry bread crust, prunes, hints of grpaefruit, leaves, caramel, candied fruit, spicey raisins, candy, alcoholic spice and warmth. The thick sweetness soon gives way, just barely, to rich hop flavours and tingly bitterness that sit on the sides of the tounge.

10099,2093,GoreStorm,4.33,"Picked up from City Beer in San Francisco on a recent trip to a show.  Pours the color of a dark honey honey, maybe an alfalfa honey. The head is about a quarter inch and hangs around all the way to the end of the brew. Steady beading is maintained the entire length as well.  Hoppy but not overtly perfumey. The malty sweetness comes out in the nose. This particular bottle there's some sort of faint quality that I want to say is a nuttyness, but I'm really unsure.  Great tasting. Before this I swore hated on most DIPA's and pales in general. The hops are nice and bitter, no perfumey quality, what makes this great is the malty sweetness. To me, if a beer with hops like this doesn't have the high malt level to balance, I just can't handle it. The alcohol does poke through just a bit.  Strangely smooth and lightly viscous as well as having the typical mouthfeel qualities of pales.  This is definitely worth checking out. I wish it came in more than a 4 pack though. Even though the alcohol is up there I would love to session a beer like this. Because of availability and price I've never had more than 2 on hand.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Taste: Lots of grapefruit rind. You won't believe this is 9.0% abv.  Mouthfeel: Almost creamy.  Drinkability: High, as long as you have a designated driver. This DIPA will knock you down if you consume as you normally would at a summer cookout. It's so good, I can't remember what I ate.

10099,2093,IBUnit63,3.78,"12-oz into Cab glass. I haven't had this for a few years, so let's see if I can trust my palate memory...  Crystal-clear copper color with sparse carbonation. Head is thin and dissipates quickly, leaving yeasty bubbles.  Extra-grassy and earthy hops, but there is that DFH tell that I remember profusely...quite a bit of earth. There's actually a little cowpie stench in there, too. Copious amber/caramel malt.  Even thought there's clamminess and the cowpie stench shows up in the back of the palate, there is a nice malty taste to this with slightly alcoholic sweetness. Still...that extra-earthy tone detracts from this quite a bit and grassys up the hop bitterness a great deal. Good, but not as impressive as one would expect.  Palate feel is OK once the earth is traversed. It's mostly amber maltiness, with some austere grassy hops and maybe some pinyness. Still, that signature DFH earthy aftertaste will bite down on it hard.  Now I remember why I haven't picked this one up recently. Decently-crafted but maybe it's the water that provides that ultra-earthiness. Not for me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S: A sweet, grapefruit smell with some balancing, hoppy, earthy, bitter notes that did well to seem like it would balance the grapefruit notes.  T: A bitter, earthy, hop taste with a well-balanced, grapefruit background that was slightly warming. A bittersweet, grapefruit note was evident in the aftertaste.  M: A smooth and pretty full-bodied beer that feels very nice on the palette and goes down like silk.  D: A very drinkable Imperial IPA. Hops and alcohol are not overbearing and well balanced by the sweet malts. I can definitely see myself hanging out, whenever, and really enjoying this brew.

I have never smelled a beer similar to this. The hops are of the floral variety. Alcohol is hidden by the hoppiness of this beer.  T- This is my favorite beer! I absolutely love the taste of this beer. Goes down VERY smooth and has a very distinct taste. A bit of a nutty and floral taste when it reaches the mouth, followed by a hop explosion. Malt balance is tremendous, but the hops are definitely the more prevalent piece of this beer.  M- A bit thicker than you'd expect which leaves a nice coating in the mouth.  D - This beer is AMAZING. The initial complex taste of nuttiness and a floral hop taste makes this a fabulous choice for hop heads! The thickness of this beer makes it a difficult beer if you're planning to drink more than one or two, but it's most definitely the best beer I've ever had when it comes to relaxing and truly enjoying a beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

However you still notice some sweet malt.  T- Alcohol is barely noticable in this hop explosion with a decent malt backdrop.  M- Thick and creamy  D - Personally I think this beer lacks drinkability. Its a great beer to have here and there but overall I could not see having more than one or two at the most in a sitting.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Caramel, maple syrup, even some creamy chocolate on the finish. Good amount of hops throughout, but unlike many other IPAs, they do not overpower the rest of the beer. Incredibly well balanced. Mmm, such a nice maple syrup, mouth-coating linger - damn.  M: A rich, full, mouth-coating texture with a somewhat oily finish that remains on the palate for a long time. Very nice carbonation level that adds a crisp spiciness to the finish as well.  D: This is my first ever Dogfish Head beer and I think it's the best IPA I've had so far.

Thus, the beer store choice was an easy purchase with a 4 pack of 90 minute IPA.  A: Pours a light/medium amber clear color with a fluffy egg white head; excellent lacing  S: The grapefruit hops is the first thing that hits you; take a deeper whiff and some other odors break through, such as pine, brandy and a bit of toffee  T: Although the hop profile is unmistakable, this is actually somewhat sweet. Starts out with toffee and grapefruit; builds into a bit of brandy soaked raisins in the middle; in the finish, the hops return to close the deal, subsuming everything else other than a touch of sweet toffee on the tip of the tongue.  M: Fairly thick for an IPA with a modest amount of carbonation .  D: Extremely impressed by this brew, the sweet and hoppy balance was pretty unique and I was hooked!

There is a lot of citrus smells in this beer, starting with a strong orange smell and even a tinge of peach. This beer has a ton of taste. The beer starts with a subtle bit of toffee malt that helps set you up for the hops. The hop taste is very strong with orange, peach, and all kind of citrus tastes with a sharp bitter tinge at the end. The mouthfeel is nice. There is a good smoothness on the tongue during the sip, but it ends with a sharp, carbonated bite. For an imperial IPA, Dogfish Head 90 Minute has a subtle malt taste to it.

I try not to take a big noseful of their beers anymore because i like alo of other things about them. other scents are there but I just think of cat piss.  T: Brilliant. One of the best balanced ipas out there, and im all about balance. malty sweetness gives way to a fleeting hop bitterness. In other words, the bitter aftertaste of many over hopped american ipas is nonexistent.  M: Light carbonation makes it easier to get a mouthful of flavor from this beer. slight bitterness of hops needs no help from carbonation, which is not much.  D: I gave this a 5 because it is the most drinkable double ipa available. I didnt like ipas before i tried this beer.

A real delightful, highly recognizable smell.  Tastes of sour biscuits, with an unreal citrus zing to boot. The lack of a darker malt really allows the hops to be the star... and that is what we really want in a DIPA. But wait ... the finish is surprisingly sweet. The amount of barley that is poured into the kettle for this one must be off the charts.  You will keep reaching for this one, although drinking more than 2 in one night would seem like a challenge.

10099,2093,cnally,4.8,"The unholy monster of a great beer called the 90 Minute IPA. This one beer has the same amount of flavor as 41 Miller Lites. It's been proven through extensive research.  The coloring of the beer is a hazy orange. As it pours there is a cascade of bubbles, the white head that settles looms for a little bit.  The scent is all malt. Big fruity notes of apple and pear.  The flavor is unique and unbelieveable. A huge malty flavor abounds immediately, with some hints of citrus - pineapple & orange. Such a delicate, mild hop flavor settles in after the malt fades, but the flavorings are balanced and perfect.  The feel is a little sticky, but so substantial and heady it is near-flawless.  Just a damn great beer. One of my personal favorites. It's like that music CD you pick up and listen to for like four straight months. Addictive and perfect.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Spidey13,4.34,"I finally got around to trying Dogfish Head's 90-Minute IPA. It pours a hazy, light orange/yellow color with a small white head that just hangs around. The smells is where this beer really shines. Lot of sweet, candied hops are on the nose. Apricots and a bit of earthiness show up. I could smell it all day.  Tasting the beer reveals more grassy hop flavors, along with a bit of sweet caramel and just a hint of roastiness. There is a smooth bitterness but nothing over-the-top. There is just a bit of alcohol burn after the swallow. The mouthfeel is very nice and full with a medium amount of carbonation.  This is a really good beer. Compared to some other double IPA's I've had, this one isn't nearly as in-your-face, but I think that is a good thing and makes it much more drinkable. Possibly dangerously so, considering the 9% ABV.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,ccrida,4.27,"On tap at the Taphouse Grill in Bellevue, which servers stale beers on dirty tap lines. This one was just tapped though, and was robust enough to stand up to the dirty tap line tang, which I've ignored for this review.  Served in a snifter, DFH 90 min is a dark clear copper with a medium, khaki head that leaves pretty heavy lace.  Smell is lots of pungent citrus, resiny, some cat pee, a very nice pungency, wow!  Taste is very well balanced, rich maltiness, spicy hops, a firm, bitter finish with the ABV very well hidden save for the dry, spicy finish. Not as sharp as the aroma with the hop flavor, but it's still big and satisfying.  Mouthfeel is super creamy and very smooth, with a medium body.  Drinkability is great, is a just a definative example of a DIPA and the American craft brew renaissance of the 20+ years. dangerously easy drinking, it could stand a bit more hop flavor to match the aroma and chewy malt backbone, but is nevertheless a great beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Chelsea1905,4.02,"A - poured more Amber than I was expecting for an IPA, but this isn't as hop-fueled as the West Coast IPA's I have been drinking. Very little head, that basically disappeared after first mouthful, and left very little lacing. Was it too chilled?  S - Nice and Hoppy, without being over-powering. In fact, I could smell malts in there too, and less citrus...more of a grapefruit hint  T - Hop and Malt balance with slightly fruity aftertaste. Really not what I was expecting, but still rather enjoyable  M - Little carbonation, and a great feel in the mouth; meaty, but not overly filling  D - At 9% the pack of 4 I bought was perfect. However, I feel like I could drink a lot more if it was less ABV'ed. Must admit, could hardly taste the alcohol",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I've had a handful of better tasting/more balanced DIPA's in my opinion but maybe its just me. Tastes very complex and isn't as hoppy as some other DIPA's out there which makes it a bit tougher in the drinkability department.

It's funny, because this is more balanced than many hoppier pale ales I've had. Mouthfeel is thick and sticky. A very rich beer. Can't drink too much as a result, but with the taste so nicely balanced, I'm tempted to go overboard anyway.

A: The pink and almost peachy colors on the wrapper will deceive you. You king of almost expect it to look like that. Golden, amber and beautiful are the words to describe this brew.  S: Incredible. Hops, fruit and malt. You can tell it will be sweet, chewy and very pleasing. Very basic yet seems intricate.  T: Nothing short of an explosion. Bounces all over and warms on the way down. Not too bitter, not too sweet, not extremely hoppy, as you would expect and no overbearing malt. Fruity esters mixed with a floral smell that fills the room.  M: Bouncy, great carbonation, a bit unexpected but suits it perfectly. Almost as if it was meant for your mouth.  D: Surprisingly great! Had 3 no problem, aside from how easily it sneaks up on you. It can be a sipper, or be cranked. Probably due to how good it is.  Overall: Nothing short of EXCELLENT. GRAB A PACK!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Solid lacing forms with each sip...  S - Slightly muted piney hops and citrus... Spice and herb characteristics are present... Very faint scents of caramel and flour...  T - Wow... Stellar for an Imperial IPA... Muted grapefruit and piney hops are first and foremost on the palette as expected, but the hops aren't overdone as in most brews of this style... A slight smokiness permeates... Faint hints of caramel and pepper were detected...  M - Thick and oily... Sturdy... This brew has a solid backbone with biting carbonation on the tongue... Taste and mouthfeel distribute themselves evenly, better than most brews... Slight, but not obnoxious aftertaste as is common with the style... This last note can't be highlighted enough and is greatly appreciate by this BA...  D - Exquisite Imperial IPA... A non-hop heads Imperial IPA... Complex with tons of character... Not a session brew by any means, but one worth stocking on a regular basis... A brew more than worthy if its lofty reputation...

I love Dogfish Head as the hops that they use give this wonderful piney notes which I don't get from any other brewery.  D: Despite high ABV, remarkably drinkable.

10099,2093,bigkahunas4,4.8,"Poured into a Dogfish snifter  A: Poured with almost no head. Thin foam lingers in the middle throughout the tasting. Sticky lacing. Color is a gradient of orange and milk chocolate throughout the snifter  S: Aromatic blend of hops and a dark roast coffee  T: Starts with light hops and coffee, ends with dark chocolate and hint of orange. The taste is incredibly balanced by the bulky malts, and thus not a big hop wallop. Very smooth for a 9% ABV, as in addition there's little taste of alcohol  M: On the lighter side, but creamy  D: This is by far my favorite beer, and I could drink it every day. With the high ABV, certainly not a session beer - two bottles is perfect, though one is really all you need. It's a beer I find hard to put down as it's smoothness really is incredible. But there is plenty of taste to enjoy between sips, so you can certainly extend its life.  I've heard knocks against Dogfish for not being hoppy enough and being too coffee; and also inconsistent in taste. I can't disagree completely, because it's not a beast of a beer, and certainly is not your typical DIPA. That said, every time I open a bottle I am completely satisfied with the taste and complexity - and never feel that it is inconsistent.

Tastes like I am chewing on hop plant itself. It is too much imo.  M Full, harsh.  D Not good. I can certainly only have one of these. It is just too bitter.  Notes: I had bought a ""4-pack"" of these about a month ago and (of course) tasted it but had not recorded my thoughts at that time. Saw it tonight on tap and decided to rate it properly.

Well balanced especially for an Imperial IPA! It has that wonderfully subtle coppery coffee DogFish Head flavor that all their hop-dominated beers have. Can't believe this beer is 9% abv--it's smoooth.  M - Probably the worst attribute for this beer, but it's still great. More thin than thick but not by much.

Easy does it with the hops, plenty of tropical flavor to go around and surprisings notes of maple and figs. Easy does it is the feel and drinkability of this beer.  Is it the best DIPA around?

I really like this one, as there are a lot of flavors that you really have to be patient and think about to get. I would love to have more than one of these, get more flavors into my head.  Very clean mouthfeel with a slight sourness as time wears on. This is a drinkable beer to me that is slightly too hoppy to have many of. Not to mention the high abv.

A: I poured it into a goblet-shaped wine glass and was immediately impressed by the deep golden, almost coppery color. It looked very inviting.  S: Then I smelled it and it wasn't just a bunch of bitter hops coming through. I could smell the fruitiness and pine. Inviting.  T&M: Still expecting a mouthful of straight bitterness, the combination of flavors that came through were quite pleasing. The creamy mouth feel added to the sensory experience. Much to my enjoyment, this DIPA wasn't ripping my tongue out with a bitter hops explosion!  D: This beer is a sipper nonetheless. At 9% ABV, just relax and savor this beer for what it is.

Although, maybe its being a West Coaster, its a new hop smell to me. Not familiar but very nice smelling. Taste is good as well. Of course you taste the hops but it was a little more balanced that I expected. Hoppy with some sweet malt, and a bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel was pleasant and on the light side.

Appearance: 90 Minute IPA pours out a crystal clear amber color that had some golden highlights when held up to a light source. A hard pour resulted in about a finger of frothy white foam. Head faded a bit on the quick side, into a thin white layer atop the beer. Some decent streaks of lace were left behind on the glass.  Smell: A nice robust hop aroma out front with some grainy malt tones. Slight citrus undertones with some resiny pine aromas. Slight hints of toffee and chocolate deep in the background. A bit of bread and tobacco.  Taste: A huge bitter hop bite right out of the gate. A bit of a chemical like presence behind the hops. Plenty of sweet malt to give this beer some balance. Almost too sweet but the hops definitely rule this beer. Tons of pine flavor and more of the tobacco that was present in the nose. Finishes dry, and damn hoppy. Warming alcohol is definitely noticed in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Great mouthfeel. Full bodied and almost chewey. Thick feeling and moderately carbonated.

There's a whole lot going on in the aroma and it gets better as it warms.  M - A medium bodied beer with good carbonation. It has somewhat of a sticky feel to it.  T - With a completes smell comes a complex taste. The piny hops hit almost at once with a nice bitter flavor. They are then followed by the caramel malts. It finishes with some citrusy hops that leave a bitter taste. A great combination of ingredients that balance one another very well. It doesn't end quite as bitter as a lot of other imperial IPAs, but certainly does the job.  A delicious complex imperial IPA. It hides the 9% abv extremely well with the loads of flavors, making it easy to drink. One of my favorites of this particular style. If you haven't tried this one you owe it to yourself, especially if you are a hops head.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,philipquarles,2.6,"Pours a nice clear copper with few bubbles and a medium, off-white head. Nice retention and lacing. Smells strongly of bitter hops and sweet earthy grain. Slightly metallic. Taste is bitter, citric, hops with a lot of strong, sweet, biscuity malt and some spice. I appreciate that DFH tries to counter the hops with malt, but rather than coexisting to create a nice balance, 90 minute is simultaneously a hop-bomb and a malt-bomb. It's certainly very flavorful, but very disjointed and seriously unrefined. The malt at least gives it a thick feel. Too big to be very drinkable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,webmanspidey,4.45,"Burnt orange color with carbonation slowly rising to the top. Considerable head when first poured. Smell of hops, grapefruit..  Smooth and powerful Double IPA.

One of my favorites.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,erikm25,4.45,A: Pours a medium orange and amber tint with a cream white head. Tilt the glass in natural sunlight and there is a bright copper color laced with deep gold tones.  S: Tangy coupled with citrus pine aromas. A caramel sweetness is present.  T: Complex hop flavor. A sharp hop taste with no lack of malt. To me the pine hops seems to be in the forefront here but rounded with toffee candies.  M: Medium body with strong great interplay with sweet and bitter.  D: Pretty unique take on this style especially considering some of the huge hop bomb beers out there.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The smell of this beer is amazing., I love the sweet smell of this beer althought the overall aroma is somewhat similar to the 60 min.  The abv is 9% on this beer however it doesn;t truly reflect that on the taste. Smooth mouthfeel with an awesome hop balance.

Leaving a slight foam layer with delicate lacing.  Aroma: Sweet bread. Coconut. Slight hop aroma, subdued. Pleasant.  Flavor: Again sweetness and coconut are present upfront. Hop bitterness asserts itself fairly quickly leaving a definite enjoyable hop aftertaste. Alcohol is fairly well hidden.  Mouthfeel: Fairly substantial. Dextrinous, almost too much, but not completely over. Could be a bit thinner perhaps.  Drinkability: Very nice for the style.

Smelled of plenty hops and spices. Taste was so good. Yea there were a ton of hops but they just added a good flavor. It was really smooth, some bite, but I could get past it. You could tell the ABV was a higher but the alcohol wasn't so overpowering as to guess it was 9%..  After the first my tongue was feeling a little damage but I wanted a second.. the 4-pack probably would have been a little to much to handle in one night..

Hops in the nose, grapefruit.  Has a unique flavor. I love unique flavors. Wife says ""a big fat yuck for me."" Why I oughtta...! Hops aren't overpowering. Very tasty, then moderate hop finish.

10099,2093,superdedooperboy,4.63,"Poured from a 12 oz. brown glass bottle into a tulip glass. Bottling date is printed on bottle: 04/10/08.  Pours a beautiful orangey-golden-amber, developing a solid single-finger slightly off-white head that dissipates slowly and sticks, leaving nice rings of lacing around the glass.  Aroma is slightly sweet and herbal; nice, though not much out of the ordinary for an IPA, and similar to that of the 60 Minute IPA.  Body is full, with a thick, slick mouthfeel that goes down smooth, with just the right amount of carbonation. Flavor is surprisingly sweet; I was expecting a huge bite of hops, but the first notes to hit are sweet, blueberry-ish notes that are soon followed by a perfect hop bitterness, with a balanced slightly sweet, slightly bitter finish with some slight alcohol burn in the throat as it goes down.  Honestly, I don't think I have ever enjoyed a beer as perfectly balanced on the palate as this one. As far as flavor goes, this ranks up there as one of the best beers I've ever had. Despite the relatively high 9% ABV, I want more, and more, and could easily drink more, and more. It is just too good.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Sweet caramel malts, a bit candy-like, with grapefruit hops. Some bitterness but the hops are relatively tame for the style. Balanced nicely. This is a nice beer but could use stronger hops with more bitterness to make this a true top Imperial IPA. But despite that this still very tasty.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Patrick999,4.3,"Had this on tap for the first time, at the Abbey.  A - Same burnished gold color, a little less head than I get out of the bottle though. Lacing still top-flight.  S - More of a grapefruit hop explosion and less sweet caramel and tea-cake than in the bottle. Smells great, but actually comes off as less complex than out of the bottle.  T - This had to have been a pretty fresh keg, because this is not the balanced 90 Minute I know from the bottle. The hops are definitely packing a hell of a punch. I've had fairly fresh bottles, but even they are not quite as hoppy as this. Just lots of grapefruit-rind hop. I can tell the drizzled-caramel cake malts are there, but they take a back seat to the hop out of this obviously fresh keg.  F - The ultra-sticky, resiny feel we know and love. This is basically unchanged from the bottle.  D - Excellent, but I think I could get hop fatigue if I tried to drink more than two. This was a real eye-opener. Very good and rated accordingly, but if pressed, I think I would prefer a bottle with about 3-4 months age on it, as I gave a similar bottle straight 5s in an earlier review. I love the fresh barley malt bill in this beer too much to have it almost completely overshadowed by hops.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

D: Not bad for an Imperial.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Incredible beer, it smells like hops, citrusy and bordering on sweet. It has a nice foamy head that laces all the way down the glass. The taste is wonderful; bright, hoppy, and surprisingly smooth and sweet. Very well balanced. Mouthfeel isn't something I usually get hung up on but this beer has a wonderful consistency. Beautiful beer.  For being 9% abv, you would never know it, hides the alcohol very well.  I can't find enough great things to say about this one. Hopefully I can find it on draft somewhere locally. Enjoy! Seek this out if possible! Wow!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,czfreeman,4.5,"This truly is the hallmark of session IPA in my opinions. Pours of a fluffy capped grapefruit-orange color, amber shades, leans to a burnt golden tone. Smells absolutley fantastic. Here all the aromas of the 60 minute are heightened, concentrated and intensified. Citric hops, pines, notes of alcohol, bitter orange rind, grapefruits, fantastic IPA aroma. Flavors are delicately-perfect balance of citric sweetness, hoppy bitterness, all finished by alcohol warmness. Flavor is biting on the finish, crisp, clean, no sticky sickening sweetness left gumming up your throat or mouth. Completely, utterly drinkable to sum it up. If you aren't a fan of IPAs or hops(I wasn't) then let this beer convert you and become a proud HOPHEAD!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The nose is sweet with carmel and has a nice background of hops. There is a slight bit of roastiness as well. This beer tastes fucking awesome. Malty, sweet and bitter; a nice citrus or fruitiness comes from the hops. There is a nice toastiness at the very end that comes out as you drink the beer. The beer so balanced, yet not bland at all. The mouthfeel is probably as close to perfect as I could imagine. Creamy and slightly carbonated. This beer is incredibly drinkable.  This is one of the best DIPAs I've had.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Pours a complex deep golden orange with reddish hues.  The flavor is surprisingly balanced, with loads of fruity hops initially followed by a slow hop bitterness and a smooth malty finish. Hardly even a hint of the 9% abv.  The mouthfeel is crisp, creamy, and syrupy - perfect.  Hugely delicious, balanced and drinkable, definitely a ""wow!"" beer that you won't be able to keeps your lips off of! This has probably spoiled me and tainted my view of any other DIPA.

Low carbonation level with s-l-o-w moving carbonation; probably a pretty thick body, me thinks. Good, not great.  Smell: Hmmm. Very sweet and fruity, pineapple and citrus. A bit bready as well, must be the malt. Quite nice.  Taste: Wow. Must be ""mystery hop X,"" this is an incredible juicy DIPA, almost cloyingly sweet, but it's an obvious hop flavor. Sweet, sweet citrus; overripe pineapple, mango, orange juice - whoa. Sort of reminds me of the Stone anniversary IPA from some years back. Malt blends seamlessly, very precisely blended flavors. Quite something.  Mouthfeel: Scha-moove. Very oily, and combined with the low carbonation level, creates a thick, creamy, almost chewy mouthful of brew. Nice.  Drinkability: Very good for a beer this big. Wonderfully blended flavor and supremely smooth feel make this a easy, painless 9 percenter. Glad this is FINALLY available in the Bay Area.

A good beer, especially considering the 9.0% ABV. Difficult to tell you are drinking 9.0% until you've finished the bottle (or glass). Can sneak up on you if you are not careful, but then again, that's half the fun, right?!

Some initial citrus notes dance on the tongue with pine followed by a dry hopness monster along with nutty malt and cloying booze and mint. 9% ABV camouflaged in the garden of hops.

10099,2093,reignsong,5,"The color to this beer is smooth, clear and well defined. Rather pretty to look at, like a brown eyed girl.  The smell is amazing! One of three beers I like to smell as much as I taste it, it literally smells like a greenhouse of flowers.  This is the bench mark of the IPA, the platinum standard. The hops are bitter/sweet well chosen for flavor, the balance of malt makes them taste sweet and floral with a little bite. This is how hops should taste in beer.  Since I like malty smooth beers with minimal tart I wanted to give 4.5 on mouthfeel just to mark something off, but it's actually a 5! It is actually the exact mouthfeel and IPA should have.  One pint fills you up, but a second beer is very tempting if you aren't too far under because it packs a good punch. Possibly the best American beer, no kidding. I hope this beer never changes, and becomes cheaper than Bud.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,ommegoose,4.5,"Bottled 5/30/08. Served cellar temperature.  Color is a bright and clear copper, with all sorts of orange hues when held to the light. The cream-colored head is frothy and long lasting. Some lacing.  Big hop aroma. Piney and herbal one second, and flowery and citrusy the next. I suspect Cascade and other C hops, and Amarillo, at least. Some honey-sweet malt comes through as well.  Impressive depth of hop flavor here. It's a strong kick of straight bitterness in the first sip or two, but complexities develop with citrus fruit (grapefruit, tangerine) and oily, leafy hops (piney, minty). It's so mouth-filling that you just want to take a bite out of the beer and chew on it. No shortage of malt here. Very pale, with some caramel/honey sweetness. Melon. Finishes mainly with minty/herbal notes. I would say there's more of this here than citrus. Some other IIPAs feature citrus much more. It wouldn't have hurt here, as sometimes the bitterness gets too close to that one-dimensional aspirin zone.  Alcohol tingles the tongue a bit, but that's part of the trade-off for more aroma at warmer temperatures. Starts off a bit bubbly, but becomes slick and fuller when the carbonation fades. Creamy. DFH continues to win when it comes to this aspect of beer.  A bomber of this would be ideal, but two bottles get the job done. Harsh for a few ounces but quickly becomes an easy drinker. I would say the booze is not especially hidden, but not a distraction. It maybe even helps. I find the second beer to be much more balanced and interesting to me. The rich malt really adds drinkability to this, as I keep finding new qualities well into the second beer. Not an everyday beer, but the availability and relative affordability make this a likely repeat buy when I have a taste for a IIPA. A rare big beer that could easily be sipped on all night.  Edit: Upon another tasting, I admired the appearance much more. Huge, thick lacing. Tons of slow-moving carbonation bubbles added to the appeal.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

It has a very fruity and refreshing smell with a bit of that bitter hop smell (very very slight) T - Citrus tastes with a nicely controlled hop. It's a dry-hop done well, bitter but not a kick to the mouth which is balanced by the sweet and citrus tastes. M - The mouth feel has a light but full body feel. Because of the ABV there is a slight tingling sensation on the tongue which adds to this great beer. It is a refreshing beer to drink at any point during the day. D - I could drink this every day of summer. The 9% ABV could be a reason not to drink many at a sitting.

10099,2093,rxdrewthejew,4.05,"I had a pretty crappy day, so was happy to find this at a local store. Really haven't seen much DFH anywhere in the San Fernando Valley.  A: A clear reddish amber with many tiny bubbles rising from the bottom. The head is just a thin film, but with good retention and lacing. Pour appears somewhat syrupy.  S: Lots of citrus and pine hops with a bit of underlying sweetness.  T: Mild sweet beginning with some nice amber malts and decent amount of sweetness. Afterwards comes out mild hops, mostly citrus. Hop flavor is much less prominent that I had expected. Good balance to the flavor, but almost comes off as a hopped up amber ale.  MF: Medium body with plenty of carbonation. Fairly smooth going down, although the carbonation does leave a nice fizzy feel in the mouth. Moderate warming.  D: Supremely drinkable IPA, but not quite as hoppy as I would like, or as I was expecting to be honest. I had this on tap at The Library in Santa Monica a few months ago and it did NOT taste like this. This could mean one of two things-the bottle is pretty old (can't tell, no bottle dating), or the wasabi peas I ate a few hours ago completely killed my taste buds. Regardless, this is a very nice beer, but I'm just used to the taste bud assault of my west coast DIPA's, and just don't get it with this.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Came to the table with a decent head, nice white meringue-looking, over a clear amber body. Nothing special about the appearance, so immediately I'm thinking, ""Meh."" Then I brought it under my nose, and things began to feel better.  Smell is grassy citrusy and floral-bright with a note of pine and warm orange peel. Solid cracker-malt base. Smells great.  Taste is full and rich, with good malt underpinnings and an intense load of hops: citrus, floral, pine-bitter, metallic and grassy. Not overly bitter, as the malt depth brings balance. This is as it SHOULD be in a DIPA. I really liked the taste.  Mouthfeel was perhaps the best part: not cloyingly sticky, but rich and round, yet with that crisp finish a DIPA should have.  Drinkability is only diminished by the intense ABV. This is not at all one-dimensional, so there are enough flavors going on to keep this one interesting for quite some time.  Here's a malt lover, giving 90-Minute a high score, so you know it must be well-made and totally balanced.

The flavor was malty sweet, and IMO the hop flavor was hidden by the alcohol and the malty sweetness. This beer is a cut above the rest, only due to its high quality ingredients.

I've been saving it for some reason, mostly because all my beer-drinking attention of late has been directed at the wonderful local seasonals. Now that we've got a cool, rainy day, at the beginning of August no less, time to let this dog out...  This beer pours a slightly hazy copper colour, with an inch of sticky, bubbly head, that takes a few minutes to disappear. Looks like a consummate IPA. The smell is very malty, with a background essence of citrus-aroma hops. A bit of heat in there too. The taste is very heavy on the sweet, molasses side, until the follow through on the finish, where the sides of my mouth perked up to the latent hop character in the balancing act that is this beer. I think the hops may have quieted down a fair bit in this bottle, which is over a year old, the majority of that time being in my fridge. Nonetheless, this is a big beer, which comes together fairly nicely overall, for its elevated alcohol.

A: amazingly clear copper color with a beautiful off white head that disappears to a minimal speckled layer of bubble islands on the surface.  S: Smells of typical strong citrus flavors, almost candy like, very hoppy. Makes me salivate. Unnoticeable alcohol presence.  T&M: This is surprisingly smooth. Carbonation and overall mouthfeel make this beer almost creamy smooth. Very hoppy up front, but fruit flavors take over shortly after, filling your taste buds with delicious sweet citrus notes. Slight alcohol warming on the way down your throat but unnoticeable in the taste or smell. As this beer warms, like other reviewers have noticed, the balance between hoppyness and sweet maltiness increases and produces an awesome flavor experience.

10099,2093,roadhouse,4.08,"Poured from 12 oz. bottle with 04/22/08 bottled on date into a snifter.  Appears a mostly clear dark orange amber with a one and a half finger off white head that leaves a bit of lacing down the side.  Aroma is of citrusy and piney hops, sweet caramel, dried fruit, and raisins.  Taste starts out with a dose of sweet malt, then the hops kick in, but are then almost overpowered by the maltiness. In the end they wind up mingling together nicely. Finish is almost cloyingly sweet, but the hops knock it back down to size. A light bitterness lingers on in the mouth.  Mouthfeel is not quite full bodied, but on the fuller side of medium. Nice and oily, good level of carbonation.  This is actually one of the first IPAs that I ever had, after Stone Ruination (starting out strong!). Since that time it has gradually faded from my favorites as I have tried other DIPAs. This one just ends up seeming a touch too low on the bitterness and high on the maltiness scale.

Mellow piney and ctirusy hops in the nose follwed by a sweet smell, very nice! Taste is amazingly balanced for a DIPA - thick malt backbone balanced by a good hop bite in the end.

The baby brother of my favorite beer, DFH 120 minute IIPA. I would love to expand on the complexity, but I do not believe there is much to expand upon.

The hops was great and balanced well...overall a good beer and I enjoyed it, not sure if I could drink more that one at a time due to the alcohol taste.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,PerzentRizen,4.92,"Dogfish Head is a brewery that consistently produces a quality beer. Their 90 minute IPA is no exception. It's look is deep in color, as IPA's go, and as you swirl it the beer takes on a look not unlike many scottish ales. 90 minute IPA will hold a thick head at first pour which will recede to a thin lace as it warms. This beer is idealy drank in a stemmed glass will a large bulb and a tight rim. This is so the amazing fruity nose can build; this happens to be this beer's most striking characteric. The aroma does not end with the first whiff. As you drink this beer you will go from liking it to loving it. Usually breweries tend to try to hard when producing an IPA and get it wrong with either too much hop bite or too little alcohol. Dogfish head's 90 minute IPA is probably the best balance between hop, malt, and alcohol of any beer I have had the pleasure of enjoying. I recommend cooling this beer to around 55 degrees and drinking it slowly so that you will give it time to warm. As it warms you will find a ""sweet spot"" where all the flavors blend. I estimate this around 61 degrees. Enjoy!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,kinger,4.52,"WOW, this is one amazing brew! Sampled a 12 ounce bottle which I poured into a merlot glass. The aroma was an intense mixture of hops, sweet malts, and more hops. The bitterness of the aroma lead me to believe that this beer may be too much for me. In the glass this beer is a wonderful amber color with ample head and very nice lacing. Once I took my first taste I was immediately blown away by the flavor of this beer. The hops were not overpowering like I had expected, in fact they hit you at first but mellow out to give way to some nice malt flavors. This beer is extremely high in alcohol content but you wouldn't know by the flavor which hides it well. I could definitely see myself enjoying a few of these and then sliding back into my comfy chair with a very nice mellow buzz.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I must say, i've had this beer on several occasions, and it blows me away every time. A perfect balance of hops and malts. I don't know if i've ever had a better double IPA. A pleasure to drink and it packs a respectable 9% ABV. I have and will buy this again.

Pine trees, resinous hops and crushed malt dominate the nose...hopheads rejoice!  Very good beer. Was expecting this to be way too hoppy, but it has a strong malt backbone to balance it out nicely. Big beer and worthy! Sometimes Dogfish goes a tad overboard, but this one hits the bullseye. Well done.  Highly recommended, especially on tap.

Smells of sweet caramel malts, apricots, and pineapple along with some freshly floral-piney and spicy herbal hops.  Flavors of sweet caramel / honey drizzled bready maltiness with fruits of the orange and pineapple varieties. A nice bit of spicy floral-piney bite, and a solid bitterness from those two plus citrus rind. Medium-full bodied brew with a lift of fluffy-fuzzy carbonation.  Damn good two-I.

A lot of hops, but not very bitter. The only taste I could home in was hops, but it was excellent in flavor. Mouthfeel was good, almost thick enough to chew. After one or two, I might get tired of the flavor. Quite a bit of hops, and it sits a bit on the heavy side.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,BrewerB,3.95,"Very prominent hints of citrus fruits and pineapple. Slightly spicy and piney. Tangerine-like character appeared later on. Big on alcohol, a bit too big I'd say. I also expected to pick up some malty sweetness in the aroma but couldn't find it.  Slightly hazy, light copper with some yellowish orange highlights. Formed a one-finger white head that did not persist. Imperial IPAs should have head retention, this one didn't.  Intense bitterness with citrusy/spicy flavors being most prominent. This bitterness lingered on into the medium-finish. Malt sweetness is there but a bit too intense.  Medium bodied, moderately carbonated. Smooth and warming. Non-astringent. Exactly what an IIPA should be!  Overall it's an intensely hoppy IIPA with lots of citrusy/spicy/piney character. A bit sweet and lacking in malt character which could be corrected by finishing the beer out drier. Fix the head retention, too and we've got and even better beer. Still, I'd definitely finish the 1st pint and maybe even a second.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Taste: Hops up front provide a nice citrus bitterness, but surprisingly a lot of malt. I get a distinct coffee aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Medium mouthfeel with a bit of stickiness. Just the right amount of carbonation for the style. Pretty dry finish.  Drinkability: I really like this beer. The hops really hit your palate, but there is enough malt there to balance it out. I wouldn't call this a session beer, but I do think it hides the 9% abv very well. I am pretty sure I could drink one of these every day and be happy.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Phenom,4.7,"One of my long time go-to IPAs. 12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass.  A: Fairly dark, more brown than some IPAs, orange on the edges. Nice creamy long-lasting head.  S: Hops, resinous, oily, delicious hops with lots of pine. A nice background of bread and caramel aromas from the English malt.  T&M: Hops are the highlight and this beer's reason for being. Hop oils coat the tongue wonderfully. The carbonation level is perfect. Some citrus and tropical fruit flavors in the back end along with a warming alcohol presence. Plenty of malt backbone balances the hops extremely well, this beer is much more than just a hop bomb.  D: Dangerously tasty, this beer is probably too strong to drink multiples in succession, no matter how much you may want too.  This bottle has been in my fridge for a while, so I actually think the hops have started to become a little muted and the malt flavors have started to assert themselves. Still a wonderful beer, just a little different. Fresh, this beer will rival any double IPA in pure enjoyability. My highest recommendation, if you have not had it before I suggest seeking it out. Really the archetype of the Double IPA style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Initially a deliciously sweet malt flavor, bittered nicely. Then I started really noticing the citrus hops. What took me by surprise was the caramel tasting malt, perhaps caused by the 90 minute boil?  M- Medium body with moderate carbonation. Very slight alcohol warming that didn't take immediately and now that the 12oz beer is almost gone I have taken notice.  D- Incredibly drinkable, the alcohol in this one really sneaks up on you.

Some candy from childhood that I can't quite identify.  Tasting this beer is quite the experience. Was prepared for the hops but wasn't quite expecting the caramel malt background. The malt profile is as deep and wide as the hop river! It's really, really nice! I kept saying that... The hop profile is medicianl, piney, and citrus. An herbal goodness emantes from this heavenly manna beer.  I can almost place that childhood smell as I reflect on this syrupy elixir. This stuff is thick.  Enjoyed this DIPA to the utmost extreme!

10099,2093,Reagan1984,4.22,"I could be cute and just write that this is the Barry Bonds version of Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA. Its 60 Minute on steroids.  The beer is just beautiful and a bright & deep amber color with some orange hues to it. There is a thick head that forms when poured from a bottle that stays for a bit and recedes to scant foam across the top of the brew. A generous amount of lacing found here.  Aroma is big and strong. First of the pine/citrus notes of the hops. But then you get a sense for the malt character and of course the alcohol. The alcohol aroma is not overpowering, but it reminds you why they sell this in 4 packs vs. 6 packs.  I consider this one of those high wire balancing acts on flavor. To get such a balanced beer at this alcohol level is impressive. It can also lead to some folks getting in trouble by enjoying one or two to many. Excellent flavor and it really packs a hop hammer. You can feel the resins/oils from the hops and the pine/grapefruit flavors just pack a punch. But you also get a deep roasted malt character here that plays very well with the hop power. You do get a small sense of the alcohol in the flavor. Just enough to remind you to be careful.  Mouth feel is big and thick and rich. Drinkable as long as you take time to enjoy the beer.  This is a classic, and I realize I'm not nearly the first on this site to write in these glowing terms. Go have one if you haven't. It may be time for another if you have.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,association330,4.47,"A - Bottle dated 10/11/2007, pours a dark golden amber with a fluffy, two-finger, off-white head that settles to a creamy, half-pinky cap with decent lacing. Large amounts of bubbles rapidly rise to the surface.  S - Moderately strong notes of grapefruit, pine sap, caramel sweetness, and floral hops. A malty hint of chocolate dust lurks beneath. Just the faintest trace of alcohol, but it proves that this beer packs a wallop.  T - Moderate carbonation rapidly rises on the tongue and settles almost as quickly while the sweet flavors of extensive caramel malts and pine/floral hop notes reveal themselves. Finishes with a strong, citrusy grapefruit presence and surprisingly moderate hop bitterness, which may or may not be due to the gradual numbing effect of the high alcohol content. A bit of chocolate dust lingers. Very well-balanced with excellent complexity.  M - Creamy, with viscosity on the heavy side of moderate. The carbonation is just right, not too prickly and not flat either. Mild, but noticeable alcohol warmth hits quickly, enveloping the mouth and back of the throat. It hints at this beer's true DIPA nature in spite of the well-hidden alcohol content.  D - At 9%, this beer will sneak up on you, but it is oh-so balanced, delicious, and deep that I can only knock off half a point for the ABV.  There is no question in my mind that I have a new favorite beer. The incredibly balanced, yet complex nature of this brew makes it an instant hit with me.

10099,2093,dasenebler,4.35,"I was expecting a really hoppy brew but what I got was a malt-wallop. Don't get me wrong: this beer is bitter and has a nice, behind-the-scenes hop character. However, the malts dominate.  Nice copper color, medium carbonation. Small head that stuck around. Aroma was a little bit of citrusy hops, some sweet malts.  First taste is of incredibly rich and sweet malts for an IPA. Wow. A huge mouthfeel and strong malt character. Some caramel flavors, roasted ones as well. What I get though is this great taste similar to a strong wood scent-- earthy, I guess. Like I said, really not as bitter as I was expecting. But you get a little bit of tang and hops towards the finish.  The label says that this brew's 90-minute hop addition is balanced by a ""ridiculous amount of English Two-Row Barley."" I almost feel like in trying to compensate for the hops, they overdid it with the malts-- but that's not a bad thing! Just not what I expected. Dangerously drinkable at 9% as well. Savor this one. Nothing is quite like it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The two combine with alcohol warmth in the finish and linger a long time. Really good balance makes this not seem like a hop bomb at all. Burps taste good too :-)  M - Very smooth. Carbonated milk.

T: Super hoppy & flavorful, noticeable grapefruit flavor once the alcohol taste dies down. I cannot get enough hops it seems, and this one doesn't disappoint.  M: Not overly carbonated, very smooth.

This is simply a special ale and the look is apricot delicious with a nice tan head. Lacing on the side is guaranteed and shows each pull... but wait... I got ahead of myself.  Floral hop bouquet is full blast! Ahhhh and caramel too. Let's report on taste since one quarter has since disappeared.  The taste is where this ale shines. It has very interesting pine and hop flavor as you expect, but with fruitcake in the mix. All this and you can still feel the malt!  Mouthfeel is perfect and drinkibility superb.

After swallowing, toasted malt and the remnants of the hops are discernable. Alcohol is fairly quiet in the taste considering the ABV. Slight campfire flavor in aftertaste.

Constructive criticism on my reviews is welcomed.  Serving: draft pint at Naja's.  Appearance: copper-orange. Bartender poured a small half-inch head that disappeared within a few minutes.  Smell: amazing floral sweet hops. I wish they made 90-min IPA air freshener. A bit of alcohol under the hops.  Taste: first thing I noticed was the sweetness, almost like hop syrup. Very well-balanced bitterness. I expected hop overload but it was just right. Hint of alcohol but the 9& ABV is nicely hidden by the bitter-sweetness of the hops. Only reason I gave it a 4.5 instead of a 5 is that I'm more into malty beer than hoppy beer, and I felt the sweetness was a tad overpowering of the carbonation. Still one of the best beers I've ever tried.  Mouthfeel: Sticky, slightly viscous syrup. I wanted a little less syrup and more carbonation but my pour might have been from the bottom of the keg for all I know.  Drinkability: highly drinkable considering the ABV and the amount of hops.

This version is better.  On tap this beer is smoother and more sedate, with a mellower hop profile than the kick-in-the-face hopping I loved so much about the bottled version.  Caramel and hops operate in balance here, at a level I'd call 'damned near perfection'.  Awesome bottled.

The aroma was nice, thick and full of hops with a hint of sweetness. The taste is very good. Full bodied, hoppy, as you would expect, with hints of the malt and a very light hint of pine. Overall, very well done IPA. Very drinkable, smooth with some aftertaste, but very enjoyable.

Retention is outstanding!  I smell a huge dose of sweet bready malt, caramel, alcahol fumieness. Hops are most definatly having a party in my glass. Not so much grapefruit, but more piney earthy hop smell.  Taste is sweet up front, with malted syrup and bready grainieness through the middle. At the swallow comes the alcahol warming, huge hoppy festival in my mouth. Citruss, earthy grainy hops, resiny hop oil, somthing nutty, or coffee like, its only after the swallow that i get this.

It has laced nicley through the first few sips.  Grapefruit and oranges are the dominate flavor from the hop with the grain pulling in somw sweetness to really balance this one out.  You are expecting it to be more bitter but the calamel and squash notes keep it in check. As it gets warm the sweetness is reduced. Very well balanced.  There is a reason it is a 4 pack.

10099,2093,ibbjamin,3.43,"I reviewed this one a year ago and thought it to be an average DIPA with more reputation than it deserves. Here we go with another try. I picked up a 4pack from my local BevMo. Forget the price, but I think it was around $12. My original review was from a four pack that was $12.19 which I purchased from Coit Liquor in San Francisco, CA. Both times I poured into a large snifter to review. The below review is the combined tasting notes from both reviews.  A one finger white head that sticks around. This one pours pretty thick. Rather transparent glowing amber color. Good amount of carbonation bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. Thick hefty lacing.  A perfectly balanced DIPA. A great beer in its own right, but when I pick up a DIPA, I'm looking for more hops. Has an earthy, woodsy, medicinal flavor that is quite unique to this beer. Some mild alcohol presence. I like it for what it is I guess.  The magic of the medicinal earthiness slightly disappears in the taste. Still very nicely balanced if that is what you are looking for. Subdued hops with a nice malt backing. Full flavor.  Mouth is relatively thick. Medium to full bodied. Very drinkable.  I can say my ratings improved since my original review, but I am still not that impressed. Guess it goes back to me being used to the west coast IPA flavors.

Well I decided to reveiw it anyway.  Dark/deep golden yellow with orange tints and hughes. Highly carbinated with a smallish but frothy and sticky head leaving excellent lacing. It is obvious in the nose that this beer has a large hop portfolio. Hard for me to pin down because none seemed to assert more than the others, but I did definately pick out grapefruit and pine. Also a definate sent of toasted grains. Starts out rather bitter and stingy up front and then into the the malt and alcohol flavors with some fruity highlights mixed in. This one is slightly overcarbed for me but did have a nice thick mouth feel. For being loaded with ingrediants as this beer obviously is it wasn't really any trouble to get it down.  I enjoyed this more than the last time, but it still doesn't quite jump on me like it does for other people, it kind of like a little of everything but nothing dominates.

A floral spice wafts above clear alcohol fumes in a sweet and alluring Siren's call.  Significant bitterness announces a complex hop symphony, followed by notes of pine character that become bolder in the finish without betraying the entry flavors.  This off-centered elixir is clean, smooth and warming with a nibble of alcohol that is significantly less than anticipated from a 9% brew.

Fantastically balanced (as rumored) it boasts a very enjoyable malty finish, definitely earns its place among the best IPAs in america. it also has kind of a three part flavor, towards the tip of the tongue it's hoppy and bitter, center is sweet, and the back is yeasty and smooth.

No citrus involved here. Tastes rather creamy... wow I don't consider myself a big fan of IPAs but this good! The malts actually have a creamy toffee like presence. There's even a fruity sweetness and spice. The hops and carbonation provide a nice tingly sensation. As with the nose the hops provide a piney grassy flavor. Has a medium mouthfeel. This is going down rather nicely. I expected the bitterness to be overwhelming but was surprised to find it this tame. I liked the 60 and I like the 90, these are probably the best IPAs I've had.

A: Bright orange-apricot color with a large white (yet light orange tinted) head that slowly settles to a nice frothy cap and leaves some spotty patterns of lacing. The color on this DIPA is very impressive, though.  S: Loads of citrus hop aromas with a faint herbal component. Grapefruit, orange, and some pine notes. There is some other kind of fruity ester aroma that I can't exactly put my finger on, but I don't think it's from the hops. Either way, the aroma is both wonderfully bold and complex at the same time.  T&M: Like the nose, a strong citrus hop character blended with a faint herbal pine flavor is up front. Again, an additional yeasty fruit ester is present, followed by some faint toasted malt flavor that comes through in the finish. The mouthfeel is sufficient, but nothing special. The body is a tad thin for me, but not so insufficient as to weaken seriously the quality of the beer.  D: 90 Minute IPA is a tasty DIPA that exemplifies the style nicely.

Massive amount of citrus hops hit the tongue first followed by a slight spicyness. The alcohol rears its head as it warms the back of the thoat on the way down. Finishes dry. Light to moderate body, was expecting a little more mouth texture but still nice.  Overall, this is a scarily poundable DIPA. At 9% you can definately feel the alcohol presence but it's masked well.

10099,2093,Ben4881,4.45,"90 Minute Imperial IPA Dogfish Head Craft Brewery  Appearance: The 90 minute pours out clear fiery orange with golden yellow highlights. There is a relatively short head that is quite thick and dissipates rather quick leaving snowflake patterns on the surface as well as some spotty lacing. A few noticeable streams of bubbles race to the surface, a testament to the clear character of the beer.  Smell: A sweet, rich caramel malt aroma hits the nose first. It doesn't last long, the hops take over. Spicy, floral hop aroma takes center stage and is more sweet than piney.  Taste: Interestingly, this brew starts strong. The bitter hop notes come in up front, giving way to a smooth, dry finish with a subtle hint of pine that is only slightly bitter. I find the smooth finish rather unique among IPA's. I like it.  Mouthfeel: This beer has a much thicker and heavier body than I expected. The clarity and presence of bubbles lead me to believe this beer would have a light body. However, the 90 minute has a solid, medium body, briefly masking the carbonation. After a few seconds, the beer begins to foam up in the mouth, bringing forth the carbonation.  Drinkability: Overall, this is a very solid effort from Dogfish Head. The hop flavors are there, but not overpoweringly bitter. 9% ABV is not extremely high, but right in there for an Imperial. I really enjoy the bitter beginning and the smooth finish of this beer. The smooth finish makes it one of the most drinkable IPA's I have tasted.

But now that DFH is again distributing in CA I decided to try it on tap. It pours a straight amber color with a fluffy off white head. It really is superbly balanced between hops and malt for a double IPA. It's got a good resiny hop feel in the mouth, but a good malt backbone that isn't too syrupy.

Other flavors I detected included cherry, orange and pine. Beer feels relatively heavy and thick while not overly carbonated. For such a big beer, the alcohol is not overwhelming. This beer is really enjoyable and one I would not mind throwing back more then one of these beers.  Anyway between 60, 90 and 120 minute ipas, the 90 stands out as my favorite as it is more intense and flavorful then the 60 minute ipa, but the 120 minute ipa is almost too intense for everyday.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

A light sweetness of mild citrus and more earth lead the way to the taste of this well hopped brew.  Mildly sweet with tangelo and pink grapefruit leading to a very earthy tea-tobacco combo that is very nicely balanced.

Appears golden orange in color, with a wispy head and lots of lacing on the glass. The smell was a bit tingly on the nose, and the hops are definitely present. Now, as someone who does not consider myself a hop head, I was interested to see what I thought of this beer. I have not had one of these in years, and I thought it was time to revisit it. I guess my palate has changed, because it was really good. Yes, it was hoppy, but it wasn't overpowering like other hop bombs I've tried. This one was very smooth and mellow, allowing me to enjoy every sip as I slowly savored it. I think it got even more drinkable as it warmed to room temp. I still can't believe that this is a double/imperial IPA with 9% abv. DFH has really made an enjoyable hoppy beer for us all.

High carbonation visible and rushing up to feed the head.  Smells a lot lighter than some of the other strong IPA's I've had. Probably because of the lack of flavoring hops. Still sort of a ""tease"" of an aroma- a mixture of super sweet ruby red grapefruit with an underlying floral character.  The bittering hops work well with the alcohol. Not overwhelmingly bitter, actually a fairly mild IPA in terms of bitterness. Some more mellow bready malts in there as well as some faint crystal that's pretty evident in the color as well, but it gives a very slight nutty sweetness.  Mouthfeel is very nice- sort of rounded and Belgiany but finishes crisp and dry. Drinkable because it's not extreme in any particular area, but I do think the recipe makes an error in leaving out a strong flavoring hop contribution. I don't really feel like I'm getting much of a hop character in any particular aspect of the beer, but maybe I was just expecting something a little more extreme from a brewery known for extreme beers and for a beer with such a strong name.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

It's a solid beer, it's not bad, but it's not my favorite DIPA.  It pours a lovely rusty orange color with a fair amount of head and some lacing. Smells earthy and grassy and malty. Taste is malty-er than expected, and overshadows the hops some. But the earthy and grassy flavors help balance it all out.

Smells of sweet and smooth citrus' with the hops blended in the background among some sweet malts and an earthy and grassy essence floating around as well. The palate is filled with zesty oranges, lemons, spices, grapefruit, dry hops, some underlying breadiness, phenols and a good hit of alcohol which ends the event perfectly. Really good carbonation keeps things interesting and the mouthfeel is pretty smooth, albeit a bit of chalkiness exists. I would describe it as light to medium bodied.

Mouthfeel is creamy, thicker o.g., easy to drink for abv, one of my favorites ever :D",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,GilGarp,4.11,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle, it's a beautiful golden red color with ample head and fair retention.  Hop aroma is immediately present but not overpowering. It's pleasant but it doesn't seem as fresh smelling as others like Hop Henge, my current favorite DIPA.  The taste is better than I remember with a nice balance between sweetness from malt and biterness from hop. Of course everthing is relative when drinking an imperial IPA.  Mouthfeel is decent but a little over carbonated and there's a slight alcohol burn.  Drinkability would be higher but one simply can't expect to make a session out of a 9% beer. I enjoy this one bottle but one is enough.  Overall, very good but I still prefer standard IPAs to double/imperial most of the time.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,cthulu81,4.35,"Alright, time to plunk down my two cents about one of the most reveared DIPAs on the market. Let me begin by admitting a personal biased FOR DFH 90 as it was my 'gateway' drug into craft beers. And I thank it every day for its enlightening effects. This bad little brew was my first imperial IPA and I haven't looked back since. Well, now that all the meaningless back-story is out of the way, how does it stack up after all these years of pleasurable quaffing? Pours a brillant light amber with a stout, dense little collar. It has such a distinctive smell; not overwhelmingly hop-driven, it seems to revolve around toasted, spicy aromas with an under-lying richness. Smells like DFH. In the mouth the smells are given new life with luxurious notes of deep malt, honey accents, resins in perfect harmony and a deliciously restrained bitterness. Very full bodied and full flavored. Once again exhibiting a tell-tale DFH 'house' aspect. Certainly not a bad thing, but it has a signature profile. Yup. Just as tasty as I remember it; not that I had any doubt.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,orangemoustache,4.71,"I enjoyed this at the Brewhaus with some friends.This was my second time sampling this delicious brew and it was even better than I had remembered.It pours a brilliant gold,the color of Gold Passion Alize with amberish red highlights,it looks like a Tequilla sunrise in my pint glass with a tall tan head that has great hang time,this lacing is as nice as I've ever seen.The nose is full of hops,very fruity,with notes of pine.This tastes like a fruit smoothie packed full of peach,orange,and watermelon,not as hoppy as the nose leads on,but plenty of hops in here for all the hop fiends out there(myself included)!The mouthfeel is intense with hops,but not abrassive or taste bud damaging like a lot of other American Doubles can be,very citrusy finish,with a slight hint of alcohol warmth on the back of the tounge.The drinkability is off the charts,along with the price tag,oh well!Great beer!!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,gonzo46and2,4.65,"One of my Favorite IPAs. A huge nosefull of grapefruit, herbs, and flowers. A great selection of hops are used in this beer including a mystery hop. Finishes bitter but balances well with the generous malts. Great with heavily flavored food. I've enjoyed the 60 and 120 but this ranks as an all-time favorite IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,rye726,4.5,Nice amber color with a frothy tan head. The nose is a tantilizing mixture or hops and fruits. A big malt profile here. The flavor does not dissapoint.

10099,2093,ROMER79,4.17,"Straight out of the tap this beer poured a nice copper color with a two finger white head. It smelled delicious. It reminded me of the smell of geueze at first. Hops, wheat, honey, and sweet sugar was detected in the smell. The taste was hoppy. You could get the hops right away, but I caught the wheat/grain, and a little bit of citrus in there as well. The mouthfeel was crisp and I found this beer to be a slow beer to drink because of the mighty hops.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,rgdgerard,4.27,"Bought a four pack to try based on BA reviews. An average pour into a pint glass yields a very impressive 2"" creamy head. The first thing you notice is that this beer smells very floral and sweet, perhaps the most beautiful smelling beer I have ever had.  Taste starts out smooth, followed by the crisp bite of very pronounced hops, which last a long time and produce lots of mouth pucker! I mean, you can taste this beer 5 minutes after your last sip. Be wary of the hops in this beer! Still, the taste is very good, but you have to love hops to fully enjoy it. I'll admit it is not my favorite beer and will never be, but the second one I had was even better than the first, so maybe I am being converted to an extreme beer-lover.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Minimal head that dissipates quickly but still produces some good lacing.  S: Nice floral and fruity hops, but malt (sweet malt) and grains ar still present. Very inviting.  T: Amazing balanced. The hops hit you but they are in no way overpowering. It is awesomely balanced with obvious malt and sweetness. Very tasty.  M: Carbonation is perfect. Very clean finish with a nice after taste.  D: Amazingly drinkable. I was expecting the hops to be overpowering but yet again suprised. I could drink the whole four pack tonight if the price was a bit more affordable. Very refreshing IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,GatorBeerNerd,4.57,"A: Pours a clear golden copper color into a pint glass. There is very little head. It is just a thin covering over the top of the glass. The way the light reflects in it makes it look almost oily.  S: A very strong smell of hops dominates the aroma. It has a fresh pine aroma as well. It definitely makes you want to take a sip.  T: Slight hop bitterness is the first taste you get on your lips. The hops however balance out quickly. It finishes very clean and refreshing. There is a lemony citrus taste that adds to the bitterness, but also helps balance the hops. I admittedly haven't had all that many IPAs, but this one along with Gordon IPA definitely are the best tasting examples I have had.  M: A medium body with an oily slickness to it. There is not much carbonation, but it will tickle the tongue a bit as your roll it in your mouth for a few seconds.  D: This one is very drinkable. Even though it starts out slightly bitter from the hops is finishes extremely clean. There is no warming effect from the alcohol at all. It is so refreshing you go back for more quickly.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

T: maltier than i expected for what's listed as an IIPA, but very good nonetheless. an immediate caramel hit is mellowed by bitter citrus rind that is subdued, but keeps the sweetness of the malt in check very well. a slight, drying bitterness lingers.

10099,2093,Tdizzle,4.57,"Purchased at BevMo! in Brea. Bottled on 3/24/08 and consumed on 5/2/08.  A- Poured into my New Belgium globe glass, this beer pours a clear amber color with a white head that settles quickly, leaving some sparce sheets of lacing on the glass.  S- The aroma is very earthy and green, with lots of musty and piney hops. There's a good amount of sweet malts and fruity yeast, with only a slight alcohol presence and some carmely sweetness as the beer warms.  T- A moderate hop bitterness is backed up by a substantial amount of malt sweetness. The finish is clean, with almost no lingering bitterness on the palate, which is odd for a DIPA, but it leaves you yearning for the next sip. The alcohol is masked very well.  M- An oily, slick, and slightly syrupy feel, with very little carbonation.  D- I don't know how this beer could get more drinkable. It's incredibly well-balanced, and the 9% ABV isn't even a factor.  An excellent double IPA, though a departure from the extremely hoppy West Coast offerings. Highly recommended.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,rhoadsrage,4.47,(Served in a nonic from a Randell full of Armadillo)  A- This beer has a crystal clear amber body with a thin ring of head that lines the glass. There wasn't much carbonation except for a few stray tiny bubbles gliding to the surface.  S- The smell of green mango and sweet fruit give way to green hops with apricot notes and a hint of caramel sweet malt popping through. The finish is a green pungent cat pee and pine blend that fills the nostrils.  T- Big fruity hops with hints of sweet toasted malt and sweet pale malt coming though with a bit of spice leading into more big green pungent hops with a nice pine bitterness. The finish has a soft fusel alcohol spice mixed with the hops.  M- This beer has a medium-light mouthfeel with a full texture and a soft alcohol heat at the finish.  D- I was a bit let down that I didn't get any fuzzy feeling on my teeth but this beer is very floral and hopolicius. I don't think I could handle to many glasses but this glass was wonderfull.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,seaoflament,4.08,"Thanks to tangfoot for sending me this one as part of the Top 100 BIF. This was one of the first craft beers I ordered online a couple years ago and I remember I used to describe it as ""strong and bitter.""  This bottle was bottled on: 02/14/08 A concentrated aroma of citrus and pine hit my nose as soon as I lift the cap.  Pours an amber color with some yellow spots when held to the light. A dense two inch head formed and takes a few moments to settle down, but I can use this time to describe the aroma.  Lots of citrus but it's a sweet citrus, and there is a brown sugar sweetness mixing in with the hops. Some pine needles are there too but the bready, toasted, malt is beginning to clear its throat and say ""I'm here in good measure too."" Caramel hides behind the toasted malt and brown sugar.  Taste is sweeter than the aroma and more balanced with a stronger presence of the malt. Very dough-like with tons of toast and caramel. Brown sugar is near the finish. There seems to be some hop bitterness trying to attack the tongue but the sweetness washes it away. Not bad, quite the change from west coast ipas that's for sure. This would make a good one to go for when you want an imperial ipa with more malt presence.  Mouth-feel is good to very good. Goes down smooth and the alcohol is almost non-existent.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,dhd1491,4.38,"Dogfish Head reprints a quote from Esquire proclaiming the 90 minute to be perhaps the best IPA in the world. Immediately, my BS radar is up. As much as I hate someone who hurts their arm patting themselves on the back, I think they may have a claim to the title. I personally have tried no better IPA.  Appearance is outstanding. Rich creamy head that recedes slowly leaving delicate lacing on the sides of the glass. Clear coppery amber coloring. Lovely grapefruity aroma. Hoppy sourness balanced just right with caramelized malty sweetness. Buttery mouthfeel. Almost no trace of alcohol despite the 9% ABV until numbness quickly starts to set in.  If you love the hops, you must try this brew. My only knock is that this is a BIG brew, as you'd expect from a double IPA. Not necessarily what I'd want to drink everyday.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,fitzy84,4.07,"On tap at the Moan and Dove. Slightly gold in light, but mainly a very dark amber color appearance with a thin/medium head and eventual lacing. The aromas were incredibly vocal smells of florals, sharp citrus, malt and hops. Initially bitter taste leads to a somewhat sweet aftertaste that really takes advantage of earthy flavors. This beer was a bit heavy for me (especially after a Kolsch) due to its heavy carbonation and tons of hops in it. However, it was typical for an imperial IPA. This drink can easily be appreciated once you get by its harshness. Definitely a solid drink for any evening.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,PatrickJR,4.62,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into nonic pint glass. (Though afterwards I saw BA's advice to pour it into snifter or tulip--next time.)  A - Pours a clear amber color with thick off-white 3-finger head. Great retention finally settling into 1/4 cap. Copius, sticky, lacing.  S - Earthy aromas akin to coffee beans and grass clippings. Some complicated things going on that I can't figure out. Sweet malts detectable in the background.  T - Immediately I taste some sweetness from the malts, followed by the onslaught of hops. A beautiful onslaught it is, releasing very minerally and vegetal flavors; raw vegetable peelings, bark, some sweet spice hints like cinnamon and nutmeg, all with the underlying coffee and grass from the nose. Alcohol is hidden exceptionally well. One of the best things I've ever tasted, beer, food, or otherwise.  M - Medium bodied with some prickly carbonation, the high ABV is barely detectable in the finish.  D - I could throw these back all night; only the price and the ABV hold me back. Delicious brew with very minimal negative characteristics.  I've never much liked super hoppy beers; the bitterness makes them unenjoyable. I don't know what Dogfish Head did with this one, but it's amazing and the bitterness is relatively low. A beer that everyone should have at least twice.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,jayrod20,4.44,The 90 minute pours a light amber color with a nice foam head that leaves a little lacing on the side of the glass. It also has a freshness date which is nice. The smell is a balanced hopiness to the nose with citrsy aroma. The flavor is a dominant hop one which is to be expected. You don't even taste the alcohol. I would love to drink a six pack of this one but it would be an expensive night. I would say it is well worth your money to buy this beer. It has a spicyness on the finish.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,MisterClean,4.41,"Praise Jesus. It made it to the West Coast. This is my first tasting of an East Coast IPA. Since the hops and preferences are from different regions this should be interesting.  A - Nice pale, golden color with light head, and nice legs. PA in this bottle is great. Most west coast IPAs are darker in color. Nice to see an IPA live up to its name.  S - Grass. Lots of grass. Slight body of maltiness with a little earthiness from bittering hops. Interesting. We only get hints of grassiness while this beer was just full of it.  T - Shocker! The grass is in the aroma, not the taste. The character of the malts shines through in this beer. Slightest hint of earthiness from the hops.  M - Very light in body. Although I prefer my IPAs Imperial style or packed with a hop punch, the mouthfeel is smooth and slightly warming with malts.  D - Definitely refreshing and I welcome the East Coast IPA version. Could almost settle for a session beer. Um, a short session.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,ElGrecoVerde,4.32,"Talk about flavor explosion. This beer nails the art of throwing flavor at every taste bud.  Aromas were heavily floral and herbal, with some spicy fruit peels as well. Gives a good, although toned down, preview of the flavor.  Flavors pour in, everything from light fruits to tasty sweets. Lots of orange and lemon rind, with some almost tea-like flavors as well. All balances off with a bready taste, finished off with another crisp hop explosion.  Very smooth and creamy feel. Almost chewy, perfect match for the flavor, and a surprisingly crisp finish upping the drinkability.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,srrn,4.65,This beer poured a clear deep amber and had a slight gold tint in the head which remained. Smells of piny hops and citrus in the background.

A little bit of a head with some lacing down the glass.  It does not smell like you think it would. Hops at first, caramel, malts, sweetness, like Walter Payton.  Has a taste like drinking lupilin glands from mama's teet. Has a very sweet malt kick to it. Very Very Very balanced.  Bittering, warm, resiny aftertaste.

10099,2093,ehlpitel,4.7,"Awesome beer, my local bar recently got it on draught and I was eager to try some pints.  The smell is intoxicating and overpowering, it's like a boquet of fruity hops that overtake your sense of smell.  The color was dark with a decent sized head depending on the way it was poured.  The taste is every bit as strong and overpowering as the smell, it is a mouth full of hops, with lots of fruity traces.  The drinkability is ok, however I was not able to drink more than one pint as the taste was so strong, so I had to resort back to pints of Sierra Nevada which tastes like a seriously subdued version of this brew.  I will definitely order it again at the bar.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Taste: Thick malts carry the hop flavors extremely well- floral/grassy hop taste on top of a malt base reminiscent of caramel. The hops are strong but well-countered and balanced here. Mouthfeel: Thick mouthfeel and very smooth. The mouthfeel very much matches the taste profile of this beer. Drinkability: The ABV will limit the 'session factor', but the alcohol is not easily noted.  For me, the epitome of a near-perfect DIPA.

10099,2093,Brewlore,4.03,Poured from a 12oz bottle  Looks quite similar to the 60-Minute . Light amber with a nice 2-finger white head. The head on this one hangs around longer than it's younger brother. A good head remains all the way through the trip.  The scent is sweet biscuity malt and piney/citrus sceneted hops.  Tastes terrific. Great bitterness. This one is still quite balanced but the hops stand tall and proud.The hops almost come out tasting somewhat fruity which is backed by sweet malts. This beer lets you know it's an DIPA but softens the blow with the sweet malts. The alcohol is there as well. Very warming.  Medium bodied and decently carbonated. Slightly odd aftertaste.  It's quite drinkable. Though at 9% ABV it might not be such a good idea to go chugging these babies. Stick with one and enjoy the ride.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,HalfFull,3.67,"A delightful IPA, and of the sorts rarely found here amongst San Diego's rarefied IPA's. Light amber in color with a thin head. No notable citrus presence. Not overly carbonated as perhaps occurs in the bottle vs. tap.  Initial barleywine notes, likely due to relatively high ABV. This is quickly overtaken with subtle licorice and coffee overtones, with the coffee lingering. Very subtle however, unlike a coffee porter for example. And very deceiving, as it is rather effective in masking the hoppieness and the strength present in the beer.  All in all a very fine brew, but the chewy malty finish makes too much of a meal out of this one, limiting drinkability, particularly in conjunction with the 9% factor.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Sugary sweetness in background with a little kick from the alcohol at the end.  M: Good level of carbonation. A little creamy while being a little sticky.  D: Better than my last review of it but I still thing this beer comes across a little hot. I also find dogfish head to be overrated IMO. --- Very nice golden-amber appearance with a thin cream colored lacing. Smells malty and like fresh flowers with the aroma of strong alcohol in the background. I personally can't smell any hops on this pour. Quite bubbly feeling in the mouth, almost harsh - I'd except something smoother from an expensive brew. Tastes very sweet and malty and finishes with the strong flavor of hops.

10099,2093,chiefydawg,4.1,"Came out a slightly hazy dark brass color. Different bubble sizes continuously rise to meet the small but fresh and active-looking whitish head. The lace manages to hold position to about the depth of the liquid itself.  Hoppy-smelling of course, delivering some grapefruit and possibly mint. Getting a mild powdered sugar sweetness to the scent as well. Wolf in sheep's clothing here - there is a lot of beer DFH is hiding.  The hop smell certainly has some backup. Though not an all-out assault, the hops go into the mouth strong and demand attention. There is also an accompanying spiciness here that is reminiscent of a high-quality Christmas ale. A couple drinks, and the grapefruit is replaced by a dried fruit taste. And don't think this isn't malty though, either - this has some meat to it (shark?) that holds its own well even with the hops and spice. In the end, the bitterness takes clear control; though had it lasted long enough to get warmer, the alcohol might have taken over eventually.  Medium-bodied and strong on most levels, this is not a beer for the meek. It is heavily hopped but fairly balanced, and quite complex, though, and I rather enjoyed this nightcap.

I'd like slightly more head. S: Passion fruit, citrus, pine, and floral from hops. Delightful hoppiness for a DIPA. Maybe smells like Sunny Delight or Pass-O-Guava juice. Man Candy! T: Great sweet maltiness with terrific bitter foil. What a balance. I taste the Pass-O-Guava also. Wowzers is this tasty. A tiny stab of heat and alcohol is a detractor.

For the most part, Dogfish is hit or miss but when they hit they hit it out of the park- as they do with this one.  Although preferred draft, this sample from 12oz bottle into Weyerbacher tulip glass.  A: Golden orange hue with puffy cloud white head and lacing that goes away quickly but the lacing stays sticky. Tiny bubbles.  S: Great hop aroma. Mango is the most pervasive and the malts are there to back it up. These are hops you can smell from across the room.  T: Matches the aroma, plenty of malt in the back end but the moment of greatness comes from the citrusy hops in every single sip that bring the mango and papaya to the party. The sweetness and the bitterness go hand in hand. Some honey and grapefruit as well.  M: The carbonation is felt and the tongue is bombarded by the flowery hop coating.  D: ABV sure does catch up with you but it is a pleasure to drink and hides every bit of the abv through the hops and sweetness.

I'm pouring this into my hotel low ball/water glass, for what it's worth.  Great color in this bear. Looks like a fine scotch with a bit of bone white head at the top. Quite a bit of visible bubbles indicates a good amount of carbonation.  I smell toasted malt, barley, and only a hint of hops. Not like the west coast style with big citrus/pine hop scent.  Fruity taste up front. Bitter finish and aftertaste. Unique for an imperial IPA. Not great, but not bad either.  Very dry feel, a little bit of oily texture. Lots of alcohol burn. Not a smooth drink.  Overall, this is different in flavor than I expected, perhaps due to the difference in hops used vs. what I am used to with West Coast style IPAs. Too much alcohol burn in this one, needs to age a bit more to smooth and mellow.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Golden brew with a nice white head, it comes right off the glass with a powerful, citric and piney hoppiness, but it brings along a balancing malty sweetness, mostly bread and caramel.

Aroma is piny as well as fruity (think tropical fruits). Taste starts with piny hops and then mellows into tropical fruits and a bit of a floral note. There is a also a little sweet, caramel-like malt, in the aftertaste. This beer is well-carbonated and has a medium body. I usually have trouble drinking a lot of DIPAs, but this is incredibly easy to down. Overall this beer is complex, tasty, and highly drinkable. Can't ask for much more than that.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Angelface,4.36,"Poured a deep reddish amber color with a decent 3 finger head. Head dissipated quickly but left a film all the way down the glass. Smells of hops with a slight scent of malt. Being a fan of the 60 min., I expected a lot from this beer. Where the 60 min. is in your face w/ hops, this beer seems more tamed and drinkable due to the added malt. A complex beer with hints of citric acid (grapefruit?). Leaves a hoppy aftertaste w/ lingering hints of malt. A great beer, extremely drinkable and smooth so watch out w/ that 9% ABV.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,GJ40,4.42,"Sampled from a 12oz bottle in a tulip glass.  A golden, orange color with small head but with good lacing. A nice fruity, hoppy aroma with hint of apricot.

10099,2093,clayrock81,4.28,"For an IPA it poured very thick and had a stout like head. A dense, red tinted brown was in my glass, covered by three-finger head that slowly dissipated and left a complete ring of laces as I drank down the cup. A very hoppy smell does pertrude, of course, but there seemes to be a little hint of sweetness, like caramel or honey or some fruitiness (I can't think of a distinct one though). Also some malt in the smell, and there is bread/coffee malt, or something of that kin, in this beer. There is of course a spiciness to this beer because there is an incredible amount of hops. Unlike some heavy duty IPA's, though, this retains a fullish body that is smooth and flavorful (a little citric) with a dry but not overdone backbite. I am not a big hophead, but if I were I could probably identify the numerous hops they must've put in this brew. Very balanced, and the 9% ABV is hidden well. A great beer whose sessionability is only limited by price and high ABV. A must have for any beer drinker to try, not just IPA fans.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Nose is hops galore, with citrus, flowers, and grass, and a mild caramel malt undertone. Taste is of the earthier, grassy hop variety, but very nicely balanced, with the citrus & malty flavors making themselves known. Medium body, and a very mild alcohol burn in the long finish.  A very well balanced & highly drinkable DIPA. One of the best examples of the style I've had. I'll definitely seek this one out again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Taste: Tastes like it smells-no surprises here. Hops present all the way with a slight sweet taste.  Mouthfeel: Dances on the tongue. Carbonation is just right. Very smooth on the tongue while being slightly(very) oily.  Drinkability: Goes down smooth and very tasteful. Easy to put back way too many-9%.  Overall a very good beer.

10099,2093,maximum12,4.5,"When oh when is Dogfish Head going to come to Minnesota? After recent tastings of the 60 Minute & now 90 Minute IPA, I need more Dogfish Head.  This beer rocks. The smell is like a Special Forces team outfitted with Hop Guns & rocks me back on my heels. It's a gorgeous shade of amberish yellow with a thin head.  This is a fantastic beer taste-wise. The hops are over the top but muted & balanced perfectly with whatever else the fine folks at Dogfish decided to dump in the vat. The hops are front & center but there's also a nice alcohol bite at the end as well.  Great beer. Extremely drinkable. I want the rest of the four pack. Next time I visit Wisconsin it might be a Dogfish run. I need to try more of their beers. Two for two at this point!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Lots of tiny bubbles rise to the top and brings the head back with a simple swirl. Nice thick lacing left behind.  S: Bold aromas. There is a huge hoppy aroma with tons of Florida grapefruit. There is a wonderful sweetness to balance out the insane amount of hops.  T: This is where this baby shines. This is one of the best DIPA's out there. Tons of citrus blast your tongue putting your senses into overload. Just enough malt is used to mute the hops a bit so that they don't totally trash your taste buds. Hoppy, sweet, and wonderful. The crown gem in the DFH crown.  M: Medium to full bodied with nice carbonation. This one really clings adding to full enjoyment.  D: I love it and have been known to knock down an entire 4 pack on many an occasion. There is no hint of the ABV in this one. Drink em until your drunk, and trust me it don't take many to accomplish the task.  Overall: Like I stated this is my favorite DIPA / IPA to date. After drinking Arrogant Bastard on a trip to Alaska (see review) I went in search of other great brews. I found this one almost immediately after coming home. I bought it and bought it, I think I picked up every 4 pack my beer guy brought in and I really fell in love with it. I continued to reach out to other great brews and I have found many of them. But when I want that perfect hop bomb I turn back to 90 min. There are others I have currently AleSmith IPA and others I am still seeking out Pliney the Elder / Younger but for now Sam C and the boys at DFH have what I believe is the best DIPA known to man.

10099,2093,Gtreid,3.8,"Poured in a pub glass. Creamy auburn color with excelent head retention, and spidery lacing. Smelled of earthy and grassy hops. Taste was excellent, but had a strong alcohol finish. Light carbonation, medium to full bodied beer, stung on the way down.

Nice golden orange/red color with carbonation present. Smelled of pineapple, citrus grapefruit, and pine resin, but where this one departs from average is the taste. Interesting mix between the bitter hops and slightly sweet notes and I could feel the warming effects of the alcohol after each sip. I always have a few bottles of this on hand, tastes great and not too hard to find makes this a big part of my liquid diet.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,BrewMonkey,4.61,"12 oz bottle.  Pours a nice clear amber with orange highlights and light off-white head. Some decent lacing left on the glass after a swirl. Nothing terribly different from other IPA's.  The aroma is very nice, verging on intense citrus, floral, candy watermelon and fruits like underripe figs. There is also a nice malt aroma with buttery caramel notes. All things considered, this is probably a top 5 for me on aroma alone.  The taste is equally complex, after a tongue tingling bitterness first greats your pallate, it fades slightly into a sweet maltiness covered in fruity hop flavor. Everytime I sip I sense some kind of candy aroma I can't quite pin down. There's almost a nutiness to the malt backbone, somewhere between peanuts and hazelnuts, and while the hop bitterness is pretty high, the hop flavors and malt flavors really play well together. Definately a back and forth between the two during the entire experience. Amazingly there is almost no hint of alcohol in the taste, and only a hint of nasal warmth in the aroma. There is however a slight warming effect.  The bubblies break up the slightly thick mouthfeel pretty well, though it seems like a dangerous balance between breaking up the thickness and becoming difficult to drink over time. Still, it doesn't get in the way at all. I can't really tell what to think about drinkability because the beer is obviously very strong and with an intense bitterness that might kill the taste buds after just one pint.  Well, this one lived up the expectations fantastically. Really a terrific beer to experience, I'm glad to have finally found a few bottles to try.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,SIRIUS2,4.44,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  A: Light amber colored and crystal clear. Pours well with about 1/2"" of initial white foam head. Head dissipates to a very thin layer of white. Good but delicate lacing.  S: Beautiful citrus hops that smell like you just cut open a fresh pink grapefruit. Absolutely fresh smelling.  T: Deep and complex hop bitterness is simply infused with the caramel flavored malt. You know they are individual but they are just joined so well and stay so solid on the tongue that you have to wonder if they weren't always together! The hop bittering is a very intense flavor but is toned down somewhat with the malt sweetness. If you roll it over your tongue for a second you will witness the hops calming down a little bit giving the malts a chance to come through. The finish is interesting in that at first it's quite intense but sort of drifts off over several seconds leaving the mouth mostly clean.  M&D: Mouthfeel is heavier than I might have suspected but it isn't too much. In fact, after tasting it, I would say they nailed it. The carbonation is light and tight, helping to create a creamy texture that sort of dissipates a slightly slippery sensation from the hops. All in all this is damn good and I have no earthly idea why I waited so long to try it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,ubermick,3.73,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a standard American pint glass.  A: Poured a nice light amber colour, with a little haze, and nice head.  S: Hops. Good God, hops. Did I mention hops???  T: Somwhat malty, followed by lots and lots and lots of hops, that stuck around for a while.  MF/D: Thick mouthfeel, a little rough, with decent carbonation. For a double IPA it's drinkability is decent, but one of these is enough for me to scurry back to the hop saftiness of a Sierra Nevada. It's a to each their own brew, and I think that your relationship with hops will be your relationship with this brew - if you LOVE 'em, you'll LOVE this. If you like 'em, you'll like this.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,BoitSansSoif,4.15,"Poured into a snifter. Rich copper-amber with pinkish tint and thick head that exhibited nice retention and left light lacing. Nose is of hops, apricot, light citrus, nice lightly toasted malt, resin, grapefruit, and sweet but faint passion fruit. Taste is sweet on attack with rich backbone of malt and hops throughout the midpalate. The hops put forward primarily grapefruit, and the pine with sweet tropical notes plays a nice second fiddle through the dry finish. Mouthfeel is very good...body is a smooth medium texture, and sweet malt and fruit notes balance will with dryness. Highly drinkable.

T - Very hoppy but incredibly smooth, with the same apricot and orange tastes that you can smell. This beer's taste is very cohesive - very well pulled together!  M - Smooth yet warm, with a clear hoppy bite.  D - This is an oustanding beer, worthy of it's own hype!

10099,2093,Kegatron,4.38,"On tap at the Dogfish Head Alehouse in Falls Church, VA. Served in a snifter.  Pours a clear copper amber with a thin brite-white head with fantastic retention. I mean this thing just continued to disperse all through my enjoyment of the glass and everytime I swirled the contents, a heavy finger of foam would fire up and leaves thick lacing behind. Very nice. The aroma is a heavy mix of pine, grapefruit citrus, rich sweet malts, and heat.  The taste is thick, sweet malts up front that give way to biting, piney hops and a flush of tart grapefruit juice. Finishes with a sticky mix of bitterness, sweetness, and warmth. The mouthfeel is rich, full, with a viscous feel at times. It wears it's 9% right out there on it's sleave but the alcohol never gets intrusive, only adding extra beef and warmth to the overall feel.  IMO, this is probably the best East Coast DIPA out there. Big with heavy hitting character that is well balanced, this is one to sit down with, sip, and savor. Just an overall great beer from Dogfish!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I could smell this the second the opener cracked the seal on the bottle, it's that strong. Out rushed a wonderful hoppiness, herbal and piney, but not overpoweringly oily.  Flavor is a solid hop bomb following the tones of the aroma, but with a nice full bready malt backbone as well. The label says that this one is ""balanced"". I have to disagree- this is very much unbalanced, but when the mood strikes, that is a wonderful thing.  Full rich creamy mouthfeel.  Definitely a very good one, up there as one of my top 3-4 Imperial IPAs at this point of my travels.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,AKBelgianBeast,4.1,"90 minute IPA pours a clear orange with good fizzy head that lingers for a few minutes. decent lace. Nose is spicey chewy hops. Taste is predominantly hoppy, but not terribly bitter. Hop flavors are rich and abundant with a good malt backbone, but I would like more bitterness. Maybe I'm biased, being a west coaster, but I love the citrus hops more so than these sort of spice flavored hops. There is certainly some citrus flavor in here, but not the blow out ruination type of feel. The malt presence is very impressive, a nice unique sweetness is quite satisfying. Mouthfeel is quite good, and drinkability is fantastic for a 9%er. Defenitely a great choice for some DIPA sessions, but don't drink too many too fast, or you'll end up like that guy in the avatar below me!

A soapy one finger head rapidly dissipated to a few stray bubbles clinging to the edges of the glass.  Aroma is sweet and Cascade hoppy - resin and grapefruit with light grassiness.  Mouthfeel only a little thicker than water and is slightly parching on the tongue, which you will forget about instantly as the significant hop profile demands your attention. Is it like chewing on a pine needle and a grapefruit rind? A little, though it's both spicier and hotter than that. Slight green grass flavor. Maple sugar and fresh bread malt flavors lurk furtively in the background, overhsadowed by the hops. Aftertaste is very bitter.  Very well executed and surprisingly drinkable, however, despite the big profile of the flavors. One is my limit, though.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

It has to be at least a year old, and really shouldn't be aged long. Poured into a brandy snifter.  Appearance- Beer pours a golden orange with a thin half finger of bone coloured foam. Lacing clings to the sides and lingers for the duration. There are very slight hints of legs on the sides of the glass.  Smell- Grapefruit and orange citrus hops with a hint of pale malts giving a very solid backbone to this hoppy ale. A bit of a piny rustic scent also on the nose. I recall fresher 90 min having more of a scent. I'll review it from the tap soon just to be sure.  Taste- Creamy, hot maltiness with big levels of hops all through the beer. The hops are definitely not as pronounced as they are fresh, but there are still pronounced hops burning the mouth along with the warming alcohol.  Mouthfeel- Warming, creamy, sticky, medium full bodied, and evenly carbonated. Slightly prickly on the tongue.  Drinkability- Good drinkability, but the beer is 9% and will creep up on you if you're not careful. Two in a night is cutting it a little big unless you really are good with your alcoholism.

Both were approximately the same gold/amber color, which was interesting considering the great difference in malt quantities. The 90 smelled strongly of floral hops. Upon taking a sip I was pleased to find that the taste was similar. It tastes like a big mouthful of delicious hops. This is certainly an extremely hoppy beer but it's incredibly well balanced too. The 9% is well hidden, and tasting the 60 alongside the 90 you wouldn't guess there's such a difference in alcohol content. The 90 tastes just like the 60, just moreso in every good way.

A- Poured a clear amber/copper with good carbonation forming a inch and a half firm yellowish white foam head with thick rings of sticky lacing after each sip.  S- The smell was a strong citrus hop with tangerine/grapefruit coming through. Did not get any alcohol smell which surprised me considering the ABV at 9%.  T- The taste started with a strong alcohol bite followed by a sweet hoppiness mixed with a slight grapefruit bitterness. As the beer warmed up the sweet malty flavors became more prominent.  MF&D- The beer was creamy, medium to full bodied. It coated the mouth well leaving a sweet alcohol warmth behind. Very good beer but definitely one to drink sparingly as one or two would suffice.

Aroma and flavor are wonderful and powerful, if a bit one dimensional. The aroma is a slap of hops, not subtle whatsoever, citric and floral and piney. The aroma I feel has a better representation of the dark caramel malt bill, and the flavor felt thinnish to me, so I edged the smell up over the flavor, but it's hardly a knock.  Relatively luxurious for the size of the hop smack here, outstanding velvety mouthfeel. I dropped the drinkability as the alcohol peppers tend to speak up as it warms a bit. Still an outstanding IPA and a wonderful big ale.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,moklett,4.62,"So I already know this is my favorite IPA (and probably favorite beer overall)... but I realized I've never done a review. Kicking back with one now, so its time to type!  Looks a little like coppery syrup. If something can look ""thick"", this is it. Sort of like that amber resin they find prehistoric insects in, or something. Just a little carpet of tight bubbles on top.  Smells... like a 90 minute. Wait, try harder. Smells sweet and tangy. The hops have a pine scent. More pine than I remember in the past. But nutty too, like pine nuts - Pine nuts roasted in peanut oil. Mmmm.  Balance is the key to the taste of this beer. Its sweet, but the sweetness offsets the bitter and smoothes the alcohol. If I were forced to complain, I'd say its a bit too sweet. If they could bring the sweetness down one notch and still keep everything balanced, I could give it a 5 for taste.  It fills your mouth like it really does have some resin in it. Gooey, but smooth.  If drinkability means having fun and savoring each sip, then this rates very highly. But I don't really know what to pair this with, food wise. Maybe some pepper-crusted fish (but I don't love fish) or maybe some pungent cheese (which I generally dislike).

10099,2093,Beertracker,4.35,"Commercial Desription: Esquire Magazine calls our 90 Minute IPA, ""perhaps the best IPA in America."" An Imperial IPA brewed to be savored from a snifter. A big beer with a great malt backbone that stands up to the extreme hopping rate. This beer is an excellent candidate for use with Randall The Enamel Animal! 9% ABV, 90 IBU's  Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA pours up with ample carbonation that creates a moderate whitish head that sits prominently atop a bright, deep golden-orangish copper body. Excellent head retention, very nice! The aroma is bursting with wet hops and a ripe fruitiness (grapefruit, pomelo, tangelo) supplimented by a solid toasted, caramel accenuated maltiness. Spicy, pungent, and definitely resiny. Alcohol warmth is detectable, but well masked by hops & malt. The inticing hoppy flavor starts off with some lightly sweet graininess that gives way to a scorching amount of bitterness. The bitterness lingers well into the warming finish, but surprisingly doesn't completely overshadow the underlying maltiness. Hints of bread pudding, mincemeat pie, spicy rumcake, and toasted pine nuts add to the overall complexity. This is an extreme hop bomb that shows both extremeness and finesse. Definitely easy to see why this has been voted the #1 IPA in America! Suggested pairings include pork chops, beef, grilled fish, frites, focaccia, split pea soup, Stilton cheese & escargot.

I really enjoyed seeing the lacing after each sip, top to bottom.  S: The floral hops are the most dominant initial smell, but it is well balanced with a huge sweet malt aroma.  T: Not surprisingly, the hops are the first thing to hit the palate, but it's on the sweeter side of things...not an abrasive bitterness. Also got some fruity undertones (grapefruit?) with a solid malt background. Definitely a sweet hop aftertaste, very sticky, seems to linger...not as bitter as some I've had. Extremely well balanced.  M: Smooth. As smooth as I've had in an IIPA, or any style for that matter. The taste just hangs around in your mouth. Yummy!  D: This one will sneak up on you.

Smell: Sweet sugary malt with a hoppy background. The in your face hops from the fresh bottle are gone, but the balance of these aromas is great.  Mouthfeel: Medium chewy body with muted carbonation. Puckering on this one brings back the hops.  Taste: Caramelly sweet and malty with a hoppy finish. This is like a wonderful, hopped up barleywine.

10099,2093,BeardedBoffin,4.42,"My virgin venture into the DIPA world. The color is an amber to golden color with a sticky cap of foam which left considerable lacing all the way down the glass. The aroma is raw oily herbal hops. The palate is again very hoppy, flowery and bitter. The big malt character manages to break through the wall of hops to provide some balance. These two giant flavors combine to produce a nice enjoyable beer. The finish is bitter and lingers for a few seconds. It is slick on the palate and the alcohol is detectable but not very much so. I am not a ""hop-head"" but was impressed with this brew. Thank you sir, may I have another.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,nrbw23,3.9,A- a bright clear golden orange color. Nice head that stayed around for a while and laced the entire glass  S- tons of hops here. Piney and floral hops I can pick up here.  T- Pine hops and more hops here again. Very nice and smooth. Can also pick up a little citrus and grape fruit in there also. Really nice tons of hop flavor no let down here.  M- Medium body I'd say. Slight carbonation also  D- Alcohol is hidden nicely. Very drinkable and dangerous. Bring on the 120!!,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,jdmorgan,4.25,"This Imperial IPA poured an amber color with a one finger head in a mug.  The smell had strong and sweet aromas of hops and a hint of malt presence. Wow! Lots of hop flavor in this one from the initial taste to the aftertaste. The hop reigns supreme here with a sweet and floral presence that lays over a nice thick malt body. Despite the heavy hop flavor and medium/high hop bitterness, balance is maintained. The carbonation is medium and the consistency is medium/thick. Hops esters give it it a semi-oily consistency.  Not a bad brew all-around. A revitalizing breath of hop flavor that is great for those who appreciate it and a lesson for those who are learning. A well-balanced brew. I could drink several of these. Well done.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Its a heavy beer which will weigh on your stomach. strong caramel and hop in the beginning, finishing with some spice, and citrus. Lots of flavor going on here, no one thing stands alone.

It poured a nice clean redish-brown hue, with a moderate head which was pretty durable. Slight amount of carbonation.  Smell was sweet and hoppy.  It was a nice taste, very hoppy, good kick of sweetness, and a solid mouthtaste.  An enjoyable drink, but honestly, as a really good IPA fan, just a bit too sweet for me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I've had this in bottles &lt;insert rant about how i sad I am buying 4-packs of bottles when i really want 6 beers&gt; in the past, but havn't reviewed yet for some reason. Guess I was waiting for it to be on tap. Who knows...  Deep orange/peach, with honey colored highlights. Sticky lacing remains once the half inch of thin head wears off.  Smell is of fresh pine. I would say Ponderosa or Lodgepole pine...let's just say i smell a lot of pines on a regular basis. Who doesn't in the middle of Oregon?  Taste is oh-so-good. For an IPA/IIPA fan like myself, this is my Woodstock. The hop profile is juicy. Raisins and brandy are the other flavors I noticed.

Maybe a finger of thick rocky head. definitely smell some nice fruity hops and also, a surprise to me, very nice sweet malt aroma. Also the alcohol is more evident as it warms. This smells like a balanced beer. I have to begin with the wonderful malty flavor and alcohol. They combine nicely with the hops. It has a wonderful mouthfeel. Not to thick, very drinkable for an IPA. I'd say the only mark against it, in my opinion is the alcohol level in the smell and taste. One of the best beers I have ever had.

S: Citrus and hops, lots of hops. You can still smell it as soon as you crack open the bottle, and you can smell it when you set the beer down. Amazing! A well balanced mix of citrus (grapefruit), grassy hops, and maybe a touch of alcohol. A nice clean smell.  T: Perfectly balanced considering this hop explosion. Again, a nice dosage of citrus. You finally pick up the alcohol towards the end. An all around great brew. The hops are there but not overdone.  M: A nice medium to heavy body that is smooth and quenching.

Pours a crisp copper/orange toned color into my pint glass. Head runs away pretty quick and leaves a light lace behind.  S- Smells of malt and more pronounced, the grapefuit. more fruity then malty. I can also detect a slight hint of hops in there. It smells quite invigorating.  T- The taste is quite hoppy and trails off into my stomach with the grapefruit flavoring. The hops are drawn out in my mouth but as i take it down i catch the grapefruit more than the hops.  M/D- Feels quite smooth and refreshing and it lived up to its expectations. This is a very relaxing beer and you dont have to stuggle to put it down. This is now my new fav IPA. As you may i have read in my other reviews i am not an IPA fan by any means.

S: Hops, grapefruit, tropical fruits, bread, wheat, apricot  T: Lemon, Orange, Pine, Caramel, Spices.  M: Supersmooth with lots of hops but a good doze of malts to balance it out. Impressive.

Taste has lots of complexity, which I appreciate. A bready base to a serious hop punch. Lots of citrus and pine flavors, some alcohol present in a dry finish. I actually thought this had surprising balance.  Mouthfeel rich, but still drinkable.  Dangerously drinkable. Picked this up as part of a mixed 6-pack and will definitely be seeking out more.

10099,2093,ckeegan04,3.92,Bottle poured into mug.  A - Hazy dark golden color with an excellent head. Head recedes to a nice foamy layer and provides great lacing.  S - Very nice. Spicy and herbal hop smell with a hint of sweeteness lurking.  T - Quick alcohol bite at first followed by an blast of earthy hops. Lots of malt sweetness pulls this a little too far to the malty side for me.  M/D - Great carbonation and very smooth.

T: Sweet raison malt base with a punch of aroma and bitter hops. Very fresh grass undertone.  M: Chewy and highly carbonated.  D: For an imperial IPA, this was very smooth and drinkable.

Huge, delicious blast of hops that continues all the way through; at first swallow, there is some alcohol sting; just an abundance of fresh, tasty hops that is somehow grounded with a bready/sweet malt side; hints of berry or tart fruit, orange, grapefruit, and pine; as it warms, a sweetness comes through with the malt; good level of carbonation  Overall I was so excited to get this and it certainly lives up to the hype - it's a damn good beer.

Tastes like unicorns and rainbows with a mix of leprachan tears . .C'mon this is a pine sandwhich with a big slice of reby red grapefruit. Not a lot of complexity, a straight forward IIPA.

10099,2093,argock,4.29,"Poured from 12oz brown bottle into an oversized wine glass. No freshness date on the bottle.  A: Looks like an orange zinfandel with a creamy appearing off-white head that fell quickly but left plenty of lace.  S: At first sniff, there are a lot of sharp grassy, herbal hops. However, as the drink progresses, the smell becomes more fruity with pineapple, orange, apricot, and grapefruit aromas. The malty sweetness also comes through with time.  T: It's hard to finger this beer for one taste, although it is far fruitier than I expected, especially after my most recent 60 Minute experience where the sour moldy grass taste was hopefully not to be duplicated or heightened. I was glad that the tastes were a much more even blend of fruity malts, tropical and luscious fruits like apricot and grapefruit, and herbal hops that are undoubtedly bitter, but not overwhelmingly so. A really big spectrum of tastes come out with this brew.  M: Not as slick and oily as I would imagine from first whiff, but it is pretty smooth and lightly carbonated for easy drinking. The alcohol is defintely not hidden but it isn't brandy either.  D: This DIPA could be consumed pretty quickly because of its smoothness without the big hops bite. I bet this beer would explode if served on cask. A much better offering from DFH than 60 Minute which creates a lot of intrigue for 120.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Lacing is quite good, scattered over half the glass in intricate patterns.  Nose seems quite balanced between orange and grapefruit with lighter pine hoppiness, and caramel malt. Sweet, tart, bitter - should be good!  Delicious, again balanced - malt and hops, sweet and bitter, caramel and citrus, decent complexity to the hop bill with the various citrusy tastes mixing with pine and a more herbal flavor. Whereas I got mostly caramel on the nose I'm getting more lighter toasted grain flavors here. Lingering bitterness and just a bit of an annoying sweet aftertaste.

Wow - I was always a fan of it draft and in the bottle, but this was even better than I ever could have imagined.

T&M - First thought is this is thick as it slides across the tongue. Definite chewiness. Everything is big but everything is balanced. A lot of floral hop bitterness but the malt counters this with a sweet caramel flavor and subtle roastedness in the aftertaste. Very complex.  D - For 9% it really goes down easy.

Taste was very pine-y, earthy hop up front with a strong midpalate sweet crystal malt presence which then finishes with a floral hop bitterness.  It is medium mouthfeel with nice carbonation that makes it easy to drink.  as for drinkability, it goes down pretty easy, and the 9% is well hidden... in fact, i didnt even realize it was that high until it was half gone and i started to feel it... two or three of these and id be ready for bed!  this is not my most revered style of beer, but this is one of the few i have tried that i would choose to drink again on occasion.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The floral / citrus hops just fill the air. Gotta enjoy this one on the warmer side (55-60 degrees) to really appreciate the aroma. Lots of sweet crystal malts balance out the orange-grapefruit hop flavor and snappy bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth and silky with a long bitter-sweet finish.

It has a nice roasted malty base with a huge amount of hops layered on top. Nice citrisy and piney hoppy bitterness flavors layered together over the malt makes for a very well made IPA.

A: It poured a classic IPA body with a bright, hazy orange topped by an abundant white head of nearly 2 fingers. The body receded to a rich ring around the collar and supported a dense lingering lacing.  S: It begins and is dominated by rich piney hops with a strong but recessive aroma of malts. The piney hops are accented by other floral hops...however....this beer is all about pine.  T: There are abundant and varied hop flavors from the sharp flavor of pine to the biting citrusy blend of oranges and grapefruit. The hops are balanced by grainy lightly toasted malts.  M: It was medium to full bodied with very light carbonation but sufficient ABV to have a clean and warm finish and just a slight bitter aftertaste.  D: I am not a big Imperial IPA fan but this one like those from Stone make me think about reevaluating my wants and likes.

The aroma is sweet. So much sweeter then I remember from previous tastings. The hops are there in full force. Floral.  As I taste this beer, I'm amazed at how well the hops and malt seem to balance, as opposed to total hop dominance. Maybe my American Barleywine kick has left me vulnerable...  Yeah, who am I kidding, this is a hoppy beer. Its just soooo smooth.... The finish is bitter though. Smooth and bitter. Can't name the hop, and its probably a blend of several varieties.  Okay, So this beer goes down smooth. Who cares, right? Its shocking when you take your first sip, but I took my first sip of 90 min. years ago. This stuff was probably one of the top 5 beers to turn me on to craft brew. As I taste it again, after drinking so... many... beers... I find that this one really is one of the best.

Hints of pine and apricot.  Taste & mouthfeel - Malty and a bit estery at first; apricot and honey spring to mind with an undertone of toasted grain. The hops really round out the flavor, leaving notes of pine, citrus and pineapple on the tongue. Body is about medium and quite slick and oily on the palate.

Malt is predominantly sweet caramel with a touch of fresh bread. Whiff of alcohol in the mix as well.  T - Sweet candy-like hops start off juicy and end with some floral and perfumy notes. Meanwhile, the bitterness is countered by a smooth, sweet malt backbone that is present throughout. Hints of orange peel, candy sugar, sweEt menthol/tobacco and eucalyptus.  M - Smooth, creamy texture with a bit of a syrupy feel. Perfect amount of carbonation. Mild heat from the ABV produces a subtle burn on the tongue. Moderate dry, bitter finish that pitches a tent in the back of the throat for a while.  D - Fantastic IPA with a complex hop profile and sturdy malt backbone.

Spicy/earthy hops, apricot, raisins, grapefruit and toasted bread fill your nose. It's a very pleasant introduction to the beer.  Flavors of caramel/crystal malt. Balanced hop bitterness. Black pepper, alcohol warmth, and a mild herbal character round out the palate.  Overall I think this is one of the most balanced 9%abv/90IBU IPAs out there. The IBUs and alcohol are covert operators; its really hard to tell that they are there until you are finished...the 9% catches up with you. Maybe are palates have been ruined by huge citrus hop bombs, but this is easy drinking at its finest. A ""must try"" for strong IPA lovers. An excellent choice for 294 calories. Whose watching them anyways...Not your average session IPA, especially since its upwards of 10 bucks a 4-pack. This is a beer to reserve for something more than just hanging out. IF you only drank 1 beer each night, 90 Minute would not serve you wrong. Not as aggressive and in your face as other Imperial IPAs, this guy is a smooth operator. The continuous hopping adds layers of depth not seen in other beers of this ABV and IBU. Smooth and dangerous, this IIPA could be your new best friend. Sorry Dublin.

Nose is fantastic, crazy hops and tons of sweet caramel. Taste is excellent; it's basically a perfect DIPA, with strong hops and malt, and absolutely delicious balance.

Flavor of resiny hops blends very nicely into a strong alcohol flavor. Hop flavor is mainly pine and citrus. Some toast malt, sweetness, and fruity notes apparent as well. Firm bitterness kicks in after a couple of seconds, but does not overwhelm. Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Fairly long finish of hop biterness and alcohol warmth. Excellent beer. Big and hoppy, yet well balanced and complex.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,hopmeamadeus,4.72,"This is exactly what an Imperial IPA should be. It has a sweet malty nose, which you'll taste throughout your session. This sweetness contrasts wonderfully with the fine citrus smell of the (Cascade? Chinook? hard to tell) finishing hops. When you take your first sip of this beer, you feel the contrast on your palate, and it feels GOOD! Don't let the OG or ABV fool you; you'll get very little alcohol burn from this. All in all, a wonderful session beer; just make sure that session maxes out at three!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,spaceranger,4.85,"This is probably one of the finest IPA's you'll ever put in your mouth. Robust, smooth, citrusy with the fully anticpated explosion of hops. A rich maltiness as well. Clean. Rich. Greatness. Dogfish is known for it's exceptional devotion to quality and taste and this brew fits their commitment to a T. The only disapointment I had with this beer is that it comes in a four-pack. As good as it is....they should market this fine product in an eight pack.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,manleyphoto,4.67,"Some people are just personalities, they can't help it, and Dogfish Head founder and president Sam Calagione is a rock star. Good looks, great marketing, and cutting edge unique beers have skyrocketed Calagione to the top of the celebrity food chain in brewing circles. Dogfish has a reputation for extreme beer. High alcohol, strange taste blends, and experimental techniques that make each of their new releases objects of desire. 90 minute IPA is one of Dogfish's year round beers, and what a beer it is. A deep golden amber pour, with a bright white head and loads and loads of citrusy and floral hops. In fact that's how the beer earned its timely moniker. Most beer is brewed with two or three hop additions; one at the beginning of the boil for bitterness, and a few more additions later on in the cooking process for flavor and aroma. 90 minute uses a Dogfish pioneered technique of adding small amouts of hops continuously through the entire 90 minute boil time. This unorthodox invention reduces the face-puckering bite some IPA's have, but adds an enormous hop presence. Dogfish uses this technique on all of their ""minute"" beers 60, 90, and 120, and with all the beers as the time increases so do the hops, alcohol and price tags. Just like people, some beers can't help but be personalities, and 90 minute is a rock star.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Big two finger, creamy, bone white head. Cool sticky lacing and very good retention.  I could smell the hops from this bad boy the second I popped the top and poured it into the glass. Big heavy grapefruit, pineapple, pine, and spruce nose with grassy, hay-like undertones. This beer is already a winner.  Whoa man, what a smooth flavor to this beer. Really has a rich caramel malt flavor with a piney hop oil/resiny finish. Almost completely backwards from the smell. There is a lingering alcohol warmth that is hidden well up front, but really kicks in on the back end.  Big, chewy mouthfeel, full bodied, slick coating of malts and hops left on the tongue.  I would say that for an iipa, drinkability is pretty good.  This iipa belongs in the upper echelon. A hop lovers delight.

10099,2093,AleDrinkToThat,4.47,"Whew. This one'll mule kick you in the teeth if you're not careful! But what a great Imperial IPA. A year ago I was barely touching IPAs, and I have Dogfish Head to thank for giving me that final boot into a great relationship with hops.  Appearance: Bright orange, slightly hazy hue under a great white head that laced like no other beer I've seen.  Smell: Within a second of cracking the top off the bottle, the hops bouquet was hitting my olfactory canal. It ransacked it when I leaned in after pouring. Hops abound, with strong citrus notes and a pretty strong alcohol presence.  Taste: Wonderful combination of moderate sweetness and BITTER floral hops, and it opens up to reveal a sweet, buttery malt that's just awesome. It's really a fun little roller coaster ride for the taste buds. The alcohol fumes in the mouth and it all goes down warm.  Mouthfeel: The hops bitterness dominates, but the sweet citrus and malt still manage to make me salivate. The alcohol fumes all over the place in there, but it's not too harsh if you've gotten used to American pales.  Drinkability: I won't lie, this ain't for the uninitiated. This is a strong, bitter beer that is going for extremity with hops. But it's delicious!

10099,2093,albern,4.42,"With over 1300 reviews already, what more can one add. The beer is a nice deep orangish amber with a nice full body and rather syrupy pour. There is a bit of a head and it surprisingly hangs around. I was expecting more of your typical barleywine experience and have the head dissipate entirely. Not so here. The smell is excellent, beautiful hoppy esters, pine, grassyness, and some sweet malts in the background. The taste is also very nice. There is a very nice balanced hoppy bite balanced by some peach type sweet malts, some florals, and just a candied sugar base. I knocked this down a little bit on the mouthfeel because there is a bit of a throaty aftertaste and some lingering bitterness that may be a bit much. Overall, this is an excellent double IPA well worth seeking out. L'Chaim.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,ksbrainard,4.05,"Appearance: This is beautiful. Crystal clear. Crystal malt red. Thin little head that lasts down the glass pretty well.  Smell: Hops. Piney citrus dirty peachy juicy hops. Awesome beautiful mega hops.  Taste: Big hops up front. Nice hops finish. But there's a kind of overbearing sticky sweet fullness in the middle. It is really overly coating and perhaps even flabby in the middle. Fortunately, the hops quickly come back to whack-a-mole that back into its little hole and leave you with a pleasurable hops impression.  Mouthfeel: I find this to be really thick. The middle feeling is just dominant throughout the experience. My tongue is numb, I guess from hops and alcohol. Fortunately the finish is led by hops and alcohol in a nice way. But it's hard to get past that big fat middle.  Drinkability: My expectation was to not like this. My memory was that it was a lot more syrupy and thick throughout, and there weren't any hops anywhere to be found. That was less than a year ago, so it's probably more me than the beer that's changed. While I still found an unpleasant fullness in the middle, my overall impression is H-O-P-S. The yucky middle fades, too, as the glass drains. It still isn't my favorite IIPA, but I can dig it now.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,BMan1113VR,4.53,"Beautiful beer. Extremely harsh hop aromas. It made my eyes water; I have never had anything this hoppy before. There are also some toasted malts, cherry and apple in the background somewhere. The appearence consists of ungodly lacing from the head; absolutely amazing. Color is a clear fizzy copper. The head is a creamy off-white with good retention. The flavor is quite complex with a nice fruity bitter finish. There is an echo of a stronger type of alcohol in their, but I cannot place it.

I am not that big of a fan of most Dog Fish Head beers, however, their IPA's are some of the best. I enjoy the 60 minute, yet I find myself wanting more. I enjoy the 120 minute, but only in small doses.

Since first consumption I have joined this website and started to seek out new and different beers. Thank you Dogfish Head. What I realized was that I really enjoy a good beer, and that there has to be comparable beers across all fronts. I may be biased in my review because this is currently my favorite beer, but I really, really enjoy it.  I have had the 90min IPA from a bottle and from a chablis at Taco Mac. The color is always a geogeous brown amber, and the smell of rich hops. It has been described to me as Sweetwater on Steroids, which is a pretty accurate description.  This beer will put you on your ass. I love it, it really makes me savor each and every sip. I love this beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Brilliant clear amber coloring, good-sized head about a finger thick, loads of retention that hangs aroung for the entire duration of enjoyment. Fair amount of lace along the sides of the glass. Smell is all hops, citrus and pine, with the alcohol emerging as well. The taste is a huge hop smack in the face - the epitome of the grapefruit hop flavor. After the bitterness subsides a bit, a sweet candy malt flavor comes through, some vanilla as well. The finish is very dry with a big alcohol warmth. Full-bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Drinkable, but the beer comes off so big (as is the intention) you are not racing back for another immediately.  A very good big IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,allergictomacros,4.54,"A - Pours a clear dark amber. Head is not overly thick, but very creamy and long lasting.  S - Sweet and very piney/woody smell. Definitely some juicy grapefruit under there and honey. There's some wow factor just opening the bottle.  T - Very sweet and malty, hops are strong but somewhat mellow as well. Unsurprisingly this is very bitter, but is balanced enough to not be overwhelming. Hops and big and juicy, but well rounded, and the alcohol takes a while to really sink in. Flavour is well beyond grapefruit - maybe grapefruit pith, with the sweetness and maltiness bringing it back to something reasonable. Very nice. Not to be [too] crass, but afterwards I was burping up pinecones.  M - Smooth with a moderate carbonation and medium bodied. Slick and oily might be descriptors. Not heavy but very substantial  D - Surprisingly drinkable for a beast of a hop bomb. Doesn't even feel like a ""sipper"" - gotta be careful with this one. Overall a very good beer, but certainly not a lot of subtlety here. A little rough around the edges for my taste, although I'm sure that's part of the appeal as well.

Smells of grapefruit, dried flowers and semi fresh hops with a little malts through in for good measure.  Taste is citrus and hops but it is a little unrefined. The malts are sweet and way in the background. This is a tasty beverage but could use a something else. More age, more malts, whatever. I enjoy it but I feel it is over rated from what others have described to me.  I would like to try one of these with the Randall the enamel animal.

10099,2093,Gehrig,4.23,"90-Minute pours two fingers of thick off-white froth atop a dark golden body, with loads of dense lacing on the Yankees pint glass--very good. The smell, naturally, is loaded with hops, some pepper, and a little fruit. I love the hops and the powerful aroma they emit, but I wouldn't mind a little diversity in the nose. With all the hops, this seems impossible; still, good. The taste is heavily bittered but nonetheless very complex. Lots of bold hop taste blends (better than the nose) with pepper, ginger, and fruit. The bitterness is a little heavy for even me, resulting in a good, though not exceptional, score. I also find that the high ABV (9%) catches up soon enough, combining with the bitterness to make this good on the drinkability scale.  Well worth trying. It's quite a good DIPA, but be prepared for lots of hop bitterness. There's no avoiding it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

T: An instant splash of citrus, followed by the aromatic spiciness of pine which continues into the flawless sweet malty, and hoppy finish.  M: Perfectly carbonated, slightly oily, and surprisingly smooth for such a high alcoholic content. This could be dangerous!

Afterward, your palate will be salvageable only through a swish of mouthwash or something like gin. Floral aromas come through very well in the taste, the after effects of which are lingering.

I have had some Doubles that were simply overly hopped IPAs, not adding anything else to carry the added hops. This has enough malt to hold up to the hops which I do love so. The hop bitterness is comparable to a spicy meal that doesn't burn you up right away, but rather builds as you partake. The aroma is wonderful, another gripe that I have some Doubles, tons of bitterness, but a lack of aroma. 90 minute is a wonderful balance of hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma. WELL DONE!!!

The lightish brown color is awesome and clearer than i thought a darker beer could be. I smell the hops, almost as much as the imperial i had from sam adams. Feels good in the mouth, BUT, the taste is ...unfortunately awful. It tastes to me like a bitter burned beer.  I had to put the drinkablility higher than the taste as i did drink 3 of the four pack, at almost ten bucks i had to at least drink more than one.

The head was white with very small and tight bubbles and the color of the beer when held up to the light looked to be a dark raw unrefined honey. There was small and tight carbonation bubbles struggling to fight their way to the surface.  I could smell the hops rite away and then a hint of fruit. After tasting it the first thing I noticed on my tongue was a green grassy flavor of hops with some floral over tones. After several sips later the fruity sweet taste burst through. It seemed to me it very much resembled a blend of bananas & honey. The alcohol is present. Because I do not drink beer in large quantities is the reason this part appeals to me!  If I had to sum this up in one sentence it would be: It taste and smells like my mothers green tea with sugar & honey and the only difference is its chilled with carbonation.  I have no problem paying the extra dollars for this brew because its so damn good!  I will pick this up any time I find it.

10099,2093,Jameson480,4.35,"Appearance - Medium amber, red and orange tint, head is not-too-sticky  Smell - You can smell the fresh ""green"" bitterness of the hops; also, there's a slight earthiness to the smell  Taste - Hoppy. Bitter. Rich. All the hoppy goodness and more of Dogfish Head's 60 Minute IPA without the overburdened syrupy sweetness of their 120 Minute IPA. Has a slight sweetness. The richness of the beer leaves a lingering aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - This is probably the most extreme beer in this style where you can't detect the excess alcohol.  Drinkability - Dogfish Head 60 and 90 Minute are some of my favorite brews. They're not a good all-around, any-time beer, but when I'm in the mood for the hoppiness, I love them.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Katrina winds twist the senses...choose a cool vessel, pour...savor the foreplay...ignite bottle rocket...there's no replay of real life...

10099,2093,atrus138,4.37,"Bright and cheery orange/amber color with a thin bone white head. Leaves rings that reminds me where I let the glass sit for a while. Smell is an opened handed smack in the face of hops. Very energizing. Lots of citrus and piny hop aromas made me eager to take a sip. Taste matches the smell. A hop lover's dream. There is a solid malt backbone, but the spotlight is definitely pointed towards the hops. Great mouthfeel - a thicker medium body helps the great flavor to stick around for a while. Definitely one of the best IPAs money can buy.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,NCBeernut,4.61,"Much sweeter and more balanced that I remember from the first time I tried it.  Fairly aggressive pour leaves a big 3 finger head. Pretty good lacing. Perfectly transparent golden orange.  S: Nice bouquet of piney and floral hop aromas with enough of bready/caramel malty sweetness to bring this brew to a nice balance. Lots of tropical fruits here as well, especially banana.  T: Everything from the smell, but the bitterness from the hops comes into play here. Alcohol is very well hidden under the rest of it. Tasty!  Smooth for an IPA with lingering fruitiness and a little hoppy bitterness. I could drink the crap out of this stuff. Very delicious and unique IPA. Not the total overpowering hop bomb I thought it would be. I tried this once before on New Years, but had a few too many to review beer, and I remember it being more of a hop-bomb. One great IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,timericka,4.92,"First time having this particular Dogfish Head. Very impressive all around. Great color, amber-gold with a little bit of burnt orange, and thin but uniform head that stayed through first sip. Smell was a rich heady burst that reminded me of caramel. Flavor was more of that but also tasted raisin and a little bit of sweet apple. Mouthfeel was not overwhelming but very present. Enough to let you know you are drinking a good beer. Alc. Content is almost immediately noticeable. Not sure if 9% is good for me but will find out when I finish my fourth. All in all ... the best beer I have had in a while.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,pershan,4.45,"The beer poured a deep, clear amber into a pint glass with a thin, white head. The aroma was of pungent, piney hops and caramel malt. The taste was an instant hit of hop flavor, with caramel, toffee malt flavors in the background, finishing with a fairly intense hop bitterness and alcoholic warmness - WOW! A high octane beer with high octane flavors - outstanding.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,jenbys2001,4.77,"This was my first experience with a very hoppy beer. What an introduction! Although the finish is understandably bitter, the flavor is very complex. I would describe the undertones as somewhat fruity. Really it's just a delicious beer that any IPA fan should try. Although the beer is medium bodied it still retains a refreshing flavor. This is now one of my favorite beers. Although the higher alcohol content (combined with the easy drinkability) has caught up with me on a few occasions.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Ineedabeerhere,3.88,"Poured many times from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours a beautiful golden-amberish color, small half finger head that doesn't last long, but leaves a spectacular lacing. The aroma is pretty good....if you have a fresh bottle (this one drops off quick). Full of citrus, honey and fresh cut grass, with the taste to compliment it.  In my opinion, the alcohol flavors (9% ABV) are not too overpowering, and contrast wonderfully with the citrus and pine-y flavors. Medium bodied, proper carbonation to an upper low level. But after trying a lot of other beers in this genre, this beer impresses me less and less every time I go back to it.  Overall, this is the most balanced of the 3 (60, 90 and 120 min IPAs), and really not what I desire when I think of a DIPA, but definitely a solid beer and a good introductory beer for the style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

This beer was amazing... so unique for an IPA that it completely took me by surprise... not as bitter as I had anticipated... this beer is more sweet than anything else... pours a beautiful copper / amber color with a nice frothy head... smell is full of esters, hops, caramel, and honey... flavor strongly complements the aroma, with a strong, sweet, caramel flavor dominated by hops... great stuff.... a full-flavored, full-bodied, rich and satisfying beer... hard to detect the hefty 9% ABV behind a great combination of flavors...

About the limit I like for extreme hopping, but they balance it so well with the malt that it works well for me. I get peach and clementine notes. Bitterness is muted nicely by the sweetness, and the floral is extreme, but not to the point of perfumery.  A real treat is to have this beer on-tap and run through their hop vessel which they affectionately refer to as ""Randall the enamel animal"". The ultimate for the diehard hophead and much preferable to the too strong, sticky sweet, syrupy 120 Minute.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Great lacing that sticks to the walls of the glass and looks like exploding fireworks  T- Hops.... bitter finish... Alcohol is noticeably stronger than the 60 min... not quite as tasty as the 60 min though. However, this is an Imperial IPA, and compared to other doubles this has superb flavor. Sweet citrus and pine... well balanced.  This is a great beer... very strong... at 9%abv it's understandable why they sell it in 4 packs.

Faint candy smell also present. When I sniff, I find myself thinking, ""This is how beer should smell.""  T: Whoo-hoo hops! While I think this beer is overrated (""Best IPA in America"" etc.), its strength lies in its ability to be hoppy as hell and still able to carry lots of flavor without overwhelming the palate with its bitterness. Taste is of light pine paired with grapefruit. A little bitterness at the finish.  M: Medium body, lots of carbonation, warms on the way down. Sticky aftertaste, but hey, it's an IPA.  D: Mmm, it's really good and available as draft beer at a lot of places. Definitely a sipper, though.  It's a good beer. It's a freaking great beer. It's not the best beer you'll ever have. It's not the best American beer. My theory about why this beer is so hyped: It can play two roles. It can be the nerdy craft beer whose flavor you carefully deconstruct. But it can also serve as an alternative to macrobrews. Instead of having four or five buds, why not have two 90 Minute IPAs? They'll be delicious and you'll still feel that warm, heady pleasantness.

10099,2093,Overlord,4.05,"Picked this up at the wonderful Lone Hill Liquor in Glendora.  Pours a ruddy orange color. Smell inch or so head that halfway through the glass dissolved into a thin white crust around the edges. Mouthfeel was good and syrupy; tons of hop juice.  This DIPA (there's no way this isn't a DIPA, I don't care what the bottle says) has the misfortune of following up one of my favorite beers of all time: 3Floyds' Dreadnaught. Still, a good beer.  Taste has a caramel backbone, some light, sweeter fruits (grapefruit ... maybe orange), and a mixture of hops and sweet malt. Almost more barleywine-ish. Not the sharp, bitter hops of a Yulesmith or Hop 15, but a more thick, chewy, spicy sensation. Aftertaste is far more complex than any initial gulp. The smell is floral hops, so this brew had a lot more going on than the smell would indicate.  Good.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,PEBKAC,4.33,"This is probably my favorite example of the style, with Maharaja rotating in when I want a little more of a sipper.  Absolutely classic amber color, inch & a quarter of densely packed eggshell-colored head, all nice & comfortable sitting in my (now everyday)Unibroue tulip. I really miss my Ommegang 2006 art glass, but this tulip holds court rather well.  Fresh & eye-opening soapy/piney hops, with something resembling the sweet smell of cedar. On the malt side, a pastry dough-like scent is trying it's best to sift through all the heavy foliage. If this was gym class, the malt would be the kid half-assing it, trying not to get sweaty & flustered. Those guys need a good kick in the shins to get moving.  My first gulp is a long one. I haven't had a beer since 2007, so I'm thirsty. :P  Whatever I said behind that kid's back in gym has obviously worked, because what hits first is the malt. Thick, salty crackers, something like bitter spinach, followed by a tingly Listerine kick. A cross between mentol & bittler lime on the hops, but my nose seems to works better then my tongue on this things, so it's only my opinion.  Mouthfeel is very well carbonated(spritzy), but even so, you can still feel the hop oil greasing things up just a bit. I like drinking this one cold, because just like your guests, things can get pretty sloppy if left unattended.  Drinkability: I'm drinking it now ain't I? I chose this beer out of all the others I had on hand. Maybe I'll pause in between with a whiskey sour or something, but I'm definitely reaching for another. What the hell?

10099,2093,Rudgers73,3.2,"This is one of the most hoppy Double IPA's I've ever had. Most DIPA's (especially with this type of ABV) have a huge malt character as a sort of base to the crazy ammount of hop flavor. I think the ""continuous hopping"" gives it lot of hop punch and keeps the focus there.  Poured into a Sam Adams pint glass it pours a nice, clear copper color. It has about a half inch of head that is off-white and it is rather retentive. The aroma is pungent with piny, resiny American hops. Floral, dry, and bitter. The flavor is very sweet like grapefruit for a split second before the rest of the hops dump out on your tongue. This beer packs a punch. It reminds me slightly of arrogant bastard in the intensity, but I think it lacks a little depth.  For the big hop head out there: this is the one. For those who prefer a lot of character and a dynamic flavor profile: This is not what everyone tells it to be. There is way to much hop, and way to little malt to make this beer truly drinkable.

Sweet fruity malt starts, transitions into a dry hoppy taste that lingers on the back of the tounge in a good way, a really good way. No hint whatsoever (except for that familiar warm and fuzzy feeling) of the very high abv of 9%. This beer is fantastic.  Mouth feel is also great, entire tounge is utilized, carbonation is perfect. Dry, hoppy finish invites you back. Once again, if I didn't know this was a 9% beer I'd never guess it.  Overall this is a fantastic beer.

T - while the aroma is astounding, the taste does not do the aroma justice. Do not get me wrong, it's good. It's one of my top 5 IPA's, I'd say, but compared to the outstanding aroma, the taste is considerably less in amplitude. It starts with a heavily sweet , but oddly, moderately acidic initial impression. This settles down to a moderate bitterness with a long, sticky finish.

I like how Dogfish Head's IPAs (so far) have had completely different characters- this one is more like an extremely alcoholic strong herbal tea than the taste-bud killing hop monster you might expect. They clearly understand that the smell wafting up to your nose is as important as the taste. And at 9% alcohol by volume, it's a good one to lay a supply of in, while we all wait out the coming hop shortage.

Not a punch in the face that I was hoping, yet very well balanced. Highly Recommended.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,roller,4.33,"Pours a slightly hazy dark golden amber. Two finger head with nice lacing. Nose is roasted malt with citrus bitterness and alcohol. Taste is citrus bitterness balanced by a hearty, earthy malt presence. The warmth of the alcohol compliments the smooth, slightly creamy mouthfeel. This is a delicious beer and one of my overall favorites.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Biscuit033,4.8,"A: Dark golden-orange, with a finger of head that falls with delicate lacing to a ring of bubbles. There are a lot of small bubbles pouring to the top all the way through this beer.  S: Fresh sqeezed orange and grapefruit, pine, amd a metallic-tin like smell. There is also a sweetness that lests you know that there are a lots of malt backing this beer.  T: Grapefruit, pine, orange peel, earthiness, and alcohol. Though there isn't much apperent malt sweetness you can feel the maltiness balancing the hops.  M: Sharp bubble, tingle on the tongue of this big beer. Nice linger of the hops on in the entire mouth. I would pay a good amount to taste this on an engine.  D: This is very well put together beer that displays the abundance of hops but adds enough malt backbone to hold it up but not take away from the aim of the brewer's objective. I would never turn this beer down no matter how many I had before.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,walshclimb,3.71,"This beer looks perfect. Nice, clear reddish amber with a long-lived, thick, off-white, frothy head that leaves nice lace rings throughout the tasting. Loads of tiny bubbles moving up through the body also add to the appearance. The smell is good with big hops up front - I get citrus and slight floral and herbal. The taste is strongly bitter in the initial flavor with a good strong, slightly sweet malt base to keep the balance. The IF transitions quickly to a bitter, slightly medicinal alcoholic aftertaste that isn't terribly, but I don't think this deserves the exceptionally high marks that this beer typically gets. Again, the mouthfeel is somewhere between average and good for an 2ipa. It is medium to full bodied with a syruppy texture and lively carbonation and a heavy alcoholic finish that sort of coats your tongue. Not unpleasant, but I have definitely had better. Overall, this is tasty and interesting but a little heavy on the alcohol flavor and finish.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S: Candied fruit, some floral aromas along with a bit of pine.  T: Excellent balance in this DIPA, maybe even tilting to the side of the malt. A big juicy and oily hop presence over a big chewy and bready malt backbone. The hops are not overwhelming in the least bit and very little bitterness comes through. The alcohol is rather apparent, though not too bad.  M: Medium to slightly chewy with a lot of carbonation.  D: A very good and interesting DIPA. Quite a bit different than the style I'm used to which is the west coast version.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Tilley4,4.53,"Wow, this is one awesome beer. I have been seeing this beer at my local bottle shops here and since I'm more of a malt head, I've been staying away from it. I decided to pick one up my last time in and it's opened my eyes to this style of beer.  It poured a wonderfully dark golden, almost amber color with one of the most fluffy heads I've ever seen that slowly faded and to a nice 1/4 inch ring that sustained the entire time.  Smelled wonderful!! Nice, hoppy, fresh smell with a definite pine and maybe lemony aroma to it. Very pleasant.  The taste of this thing blew me away. Definite hoppiness to the beer but it was balanced great with just the right amount of malt to it. Nice bitterness at the end that added the right touch to this.  This beer seems stronger than the 9% ABV on the bottle but it is hidden so well, I didn't realize it until it was gone. Not sure how many of these I could drink due to the alcohol, but this was one damn fine beer. I will definitely be having and enjoying this again. I want to try the 120 now!!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,MMAJYK,3.9,"A- Bright copper with yellow hues. The head is minimal, but it is bright white. It is totally, 100% transparent.  S- At first smell, you can tell this is a high ABV beer. Along with the alcohol, I smell a strong hoppy smell up front. I also pick up a piney smell in the middle of the nose. Then you can sense the citrus aromas. All in all, the scent is musky I would have to say.  T- Taste is first of roasty, burnt grapefruit. It is bitter sweet with bitter citrus/fruit flavor in the end. The aftertaste is of strong alcohol.  M- Zingy and oily to me. It is mid thickness (or thin) and has a stinging mid-high carbonation.  D- This is a very nice, but strong beer. I dont think this would make a session beer at all. But, for one at a time, not bad.  I think this is a nice and different IPA. It has alot of the qualities of a good IPA, but DFH always pushes the envelope a little with their own spin. Maybe not my favorite IPA, but its a damn good one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Pauly2X,4.19,"A- Clear dark gold/amber color, poured one finger head.  S- Fantastic hop aroma, I love it!  T- Any more hops would be overkill. Balanced with just enough malt to bring er on home.  M- Nice but nothing fantastic here.  D- One usually scratches the hop itch.  Arguably the best IPA!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,superswing123,4.8,"Well to borrow Dogfish Head's own label:  ""what you have h-e-r-e""  Hey, one heck of a great beer, to say the least.  Outside of the 120 minute of which I had only one (too alcoholic for more than one).... this one is the best available.  Appearance: Bronzy, bold, good head that doesn't last all that long but swill a bit and &lt;back&gt; it is! Minor lacing along the glass.  Smell: Citrus, pine, loads of hops (loads), and malts at play.  Taste: Wow. Just one of the best balanced IPA's going. I can understand why this has been voted in the high rankings it has attained. The flavors abound...kinda take you by surprise now and again. I've had this brew many times before this rating and it's always been like that. Just GREAT!  Mouthfeel: Some bite in there to remind you this is no soft drink. Coats your whole mouth and throat in an envelope of flavors. Sweet and rich. (Like some gals I've known.)  Drinkability: I'd rank that pretty high. This one's something to slow down and savor awhile. Contemplate what went into making it. When they talk about a 90 minute hop addition and dry hopping after that... well, somebody's gone to a lot of trouble to bring this beverage to you in this state of quality.  Dogfish.... What can I say? I only hope your brewery can keep up with the demand for the fine beverages you're sending out there. 'Cause the demand has to be big. I can hardly find this anymore here in NJ and everyone's telling me ""sorry...sold out...not available.""  Oh well, I'll go back to homebrewing my own hopped-up IPA's soon, but I don't know if I'll ever get close to the taste of this one.  Thanks DH!  .... WIlly",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Traquairlover,4.27,"This was a 12-oz bottle poured into a standard pint glass.  A = Clear amber color, nice head (not overly large) with good lacing.  S = Nice fruity hops, overlay of grapefruit with nice underlay of fresh pine. Although this has a high ABV the alcohol is well masked.  T = Very hoppy, but a rich complex flavor, not just simple hops bitterness. The grapefruit in the scent is there in large amounts and the pine from the smell continues into the taste, too. However, there is also a healthy addition of nice almost oaky maltiness giving this a much richer taste than I expected.  M = Feels very good in the mouth. Pleasurably full bodied and nice carbonation that tickles the mouth without over doing it into an explosive excess.  D = I rate this as a very drinkable beer. I recently read a thread discussing what this category should mean, but I think this beer satisfies any of the definitions. With the high ABV obviously care should be taken on quantity, but honestly if this were exactly what it is but only 3.2, I'd happily drink it all night. Not only does it have a great taste profile such that I would be happy to drink it again on many occasions.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Deus1138,4.12,"This is my second time sampling this beer. I am enjoying it much more the second time around.  Pours a nice golden orange, copper color. Strong citrus hops burst out of the glass from the pour.  Taste: No surprises here, lots of hop bitterness! Lots of citrus goodness coming through. At times, I swear I am drinking Ruby Red Grape Fruit Juice. The bitterness really sticks to your tongue after each gulp. I'm wondering if the slight oiliness of the brew has something to do with it coating your tongue like a glaze.  I was really into the Pale Ales for a while, but ventured away from them for the Belgians and Stouts. I bought this again just to put some variety in my mixer pack. I'm glad I gave this another shot. I enjoyed it the first time, but I'm appreciating it much more this time around.  I wouldn't give this beer to someone I'm trying to get off of the macro lagers. There is just too much flavor here to throw at them all at once. This is something you have to build up to.  An excellent Pale Ale.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

In the taste the grapefruit isnt nearly as pronounced as in the smell but still there. Nice piney hop flavor, alcohol finish. Nice thick mouthfeel.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,TheodorHerzl,4.37,"It pours a nice deep amber hue with a slight touch of orange. Decent head to start with, but it quickly dissipated and left good lacing on my glass. The nose is packed full of hop aroma settling into citrus and pine scent with the malt scent trying to make it through all of that hop scent. Bitter at first, but the malt quickly comes into play balancing out that bitterness. The sweet caramel finish on this is my favorite aspect of the beer. It is just very well balanced and not a tongue/taste bud grenade that will make everything taste like pine cones for the next few hours. Each drink the flavors of those hops keep coming though. Citrus, pine, and grapefruit meld so well with the sweet sticky caramel finish. The mouthfeel as I stated is very sticky and the beer coats your entire mouth very well, and is still so crisp and actually extremely refreshing.

It poured out into a copper/orange-gold with excellent head and superb lacing once the drinking commenced.  The smell was dominated by hops and nice piney/floral undertones.  The taste was just as good, a refreshing and awakening blend of hops lead into an awesome mouthfeel.  I also appreciate the drinkability of this IPA, perhaps it is so drinkable because it is so darn tasty.

10099,2093,Gizmo,4.52,"This comes in a 4-pack with the words ""possibly the best American made IPA"" on it; hmmm, let's find out. It pours a deep golden orange, with a good sized off-white head that has great retention and lacing.  Nose is full of fresh hops. Lots of fresh hop oils, fresh citrus, orange, pine, and also a nice doughy malt background. In the ballpark of 60-min ipa, only better.  Taste starts very hoppy, with lots of fresh piney hops, oily and resinous, but not at all overdone; just lots of chewy, juicy hops. There's also some orange zest in there, and a very nice, doughy, almost sticky malt profile with lots of honey and caramel notes. Finish is doughy, piney, citrusy, and fantastically hoppy; really nice aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is sinfully smooth and thick, with a nice hefty body one would expect in an imperial ipa.  A damn fine Imperial ipa in my book. Extremely well balanced, with a great, complex overall profile, and mighty drinkable for 9.0 % abv. Well worth seeking out.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

A- Noticably thick pour- ruby glowing orange color- some brown hues to it- fluffy white head- not much lacing though.  S- Smell was of hops all the way through- some malt.  T- Taste was sweeter than expected for the extreme amount of hops used- caramel, citrus, some bitter notes.  M- Mouthfeel was sticky as all hell- almost made my lips stick together- enjoyable nonetheless.  D- I could drink maybe 2 or 3 of these in a sitting, but will ultimately fall asleep.

Some chocolate and fruit. Heavy and complex. Really outstanding.  The taste is out of this world. Huge malt, huge hops, but balanced and deep. I taste a wonderful, not harsh, bitterness at first, and then the maltiness comes through. It finishes clean and slightly biscuity. Wow.  The mouthfeel is very acceptable. A little chewy and sticky. The carbonation allows the beer to take on a slightly more velvety feel. No flaws detected.  The drinkability of this one is very acceptable.

Settles to a nice surface covering with good lace. Lots of little bubbles rising up to the top of my glass. Aromas of sweet, roasted malt, citrus, and piney hops galore! The taste is a perfect balance of roasted malty sweetness and citrusy hop bitterness, and of course a bit of alcohol. The flavors are not very complex, but they are spot on! Has a smooth and creamy ,yet crisp, full bodied mouthfeel with moderate to high carbonation. Has a bit of an oily texture and coats the inside of your mouth. It becomes more drinkable as it warms.

Decent size foamy, off-white head that mostly diminishes down to a ring, leaving good lace throughout. The clarity is mostly clear with some hazing and moderate carbonation. The nose is of toasted, sweet, bready malt and floral to citrus hop aroma. Upon tasting, the citrusy hop bitterness hits first, followed by a sweet, almost cake-like maltiness. Also noticed some spice and raisiny undertones. Mouthfeel is full bodied with an oily, almost lightly syrupy texture with lively carbonation and a fairly astringent finish.  Wow, now this is an outstanding beer. I love the balance it has between all of those hops and those sweet malts. Masterfully crafted, big beer that is supremely fit to the style.

The malt isn't as prominent and the beer feels very sweet/mellow in the aftertaste. Nice lingering bitterness. Definitely not as overpowering as 120 Minute IPA but for some reason, I prefer the 60 Minute IPA over this.  Still not too bad for an Imperial IPA. could use more malt balance.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,beerphilosopher,4.3,"Pours a rich deep amber gold color with radient highlights when held to the light. A dense white head rises up and leaves a streaking of fine lace in the inner rim of the glassware. The nose is nearly all of hops, as one might guess, but accentuated by sweet malt as well. The label states that this Imperial IPA features ""a single, constant 90-minute hop addition,"" Hence the name, and ""a ridiculous amount of English Two-row Barley."" This impressive enough, but add to this the fact that this beer is dry hopped in the tanks as well and you clearly have a special beer on your hands. The fresh alpha acids and resins from the hops are evident here, and the nose is blossoming with fresh hoppy goodness. The palate is fresh, herbal, and slightly floral. The hop presence is formidable, of course. Resinous and biting - this beer stops short of being harsh due to the strong malt backbone. The hps remain asservive throughout. I find this beer to be surprisingly balanced - not the absolute hop-bomb you might expect from a beer with, what, 90 IBUs? Mouth feel is thick, juicy and coating. The pronounced hop resins, along with the smooth, nearly cloying malts, make this beer seem almost slippery. Both the sweetness and the hop bitterness linger a long tme on the tongue. Slightly biting from the 9% ABV, but not overly alcoholic in the mouth. In terms of drinkability, this is where the DFH 90-Minute really shines in my view. The incredibly well-crafted Imperial IPA is a joy to consume and not a struggle like some overly-hopped, under-balanced examples can be. This is truly an IPA to be reckoned with. Without a doubt, this is one of the finest, most brilliantly crafted IPAs i've ever had the pleasure to drink. It's strong, yes, but never clumbsy or over-wrought. A true masterpiece in the ""Imperial"" beer category. I love Dogfish Head beers and the 90-Minute is precisely why.

S - Its sitting next to me and I can smell it. It starts with a floral hops scent then backs i up with some malty accents. I can detect a little alcohol in the nose.  T - Surprising that this doesn't slam dunk me with hops like the 60 min did. It starts with some alcohol tastes, and then has a fair hops taste. Finishes with a very malty flavor. Only lightly bitter. I'm actually a little disappointed that there isn't more alpha acids in this one - hops are just too muted for me when I'm looking for an IPA.  M - Very smooth and creamy. The beer certainly has body to it  D- A good beer to relax to. Its a bit potent for me to drink more than 2 at a sitting. I'm going to age the rest and break them out on special occasions.

Smell- Nose is of warm rising bread and yeast, sweet but still with some tang.  Taste- Taste is multi-faceted there are smooth hops up front that explode onto the tongue before subduing slightly into a more tangy, piney, lemony, fruit midsection. The beer finishes with a fairly intense aftertaste of bread dough and yeast. An incredibly complex and multi-staged brew.  Mouthfeel- This is where I really recognize the alcohol content, it makes my palate buzz a little bit, but in a very pleasant way. Really fills the entire mouth.  Drinkability- A great sipping beer, almost too big a beer for multiple in one sitting, best enjoyed as a sipper so as to fully get its flavor.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S: In the low portion of the nasal cavity I find pungent green grapefruit rind, old lime juice and lemon zest. A deeper whiff allows bubblegum, butterscotch and watermelon to come forth.  T: Starts with a good balance between hops and gentle malts. Little bit of tutti fruity, minor caramel notes are aided by a sprinkling of floral hops. Not as hoppy as I would have expected, but thats ok... I appreciate the balance that this beer maintains. Soft green fruits with a hint of ethanol mingle well with the malty flavors. Underlying bitterness ensues, but its hardly harsh or overbearing. Finishes with gentle sweetness with kiwi and apple aspects.  M: Medium body, straight forward mouthfeel.  D: Wonderfully drinkable. Well crafted indeed. Highly recommended to hop heads or even a first time craft beer drinker.

Retention is pretty damn good, leaving thick sheets of foam along the glass.  S: Rather mellow nose, but complex nonetheless. Earthy, grassy, floral, and aromatic hops meet the nose. Malts also play a big role, adding some sweet aromas (caramel, brown sugar, honey, toffee). Solid nose.  T: Ohhhh yea. Very balanced flavor profile. Hops are bitter, earthy, piny, resinous, and grassy. Almost adds a tart puckering aspect. Malts give LOTS of toffee and nuts, honey, caramel, and cocoa powder? Also, honey, residual sugar, and an underlying sweetness really balance the hop attack. As it warms, a bready/biscuity note can be appreciated- also some brandy or whiskey.

As the beer warms the thickness seems to reduce slightly.  D - This one goes down pretty easy given how strong it is.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Very creamy off-white head,slightly hazed medium color. Very good retention leaving sticky webby lacing down the glass. Constiant streams of tony bubbles rising from the center of the glass.  Clean,very malty aroma,sweet carmell with a burnt edge.Lots of pineapple with a hint of alcohol. Aroma was pleasing between strong to moderate leaning towards strong.  Strong burnt sweet carmelly taste,as in the aroma. Strong piney hop presence with a leafy/resinous feel. A warming alcohol feel not overbearing. Not a complex taste the first taste is about what you get through the entire beer.  Full/thick mouthfeel that's cloying and sticky.

10099,2093,MarkSCCOT,2.98,"I think this is a true case of what happens when you drink a beer too young. I have several 90 min's that are fresh and the remainder of this 4 pack is going into the cellar.  A. Poured a nice golden yellow with a medium white head that dissipates top a thin lace.  S. Some sweet malt and hops, but overwhelmed by the alcohol warmness. This is a hot brew.  T. The malt and hops struggle to show themselves, but again the alcohol rushes to the forefront. I hope the alcohol mellows with cellaring.  D. This is a strong alcohol with little payoff from the beer itself and the brewers skill. I plan to spread this 4 pack over the next few years to see if aging does work.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,cdrummer,4.4,"A: Pours a lovely, creamy white head of sparce foam that laces fairly quickly, but does remain for the duration of the enjoyment process.  S: The nose is huge and impressive. Pleasant grapefruit and floral aromas with hints of peach and apricot. As it warms, a touch of pine shows up for the party.  T: The hops attack quickly, setting up strong, bitter, cirtus tartness on the tongue. It feels quite thicker that I expected. The alcohol is evident as it finishes, leaving a dry, warming feeling across the palette.  D: This beer goes down easy, but works best as a sipper, since it tends to open up its terrific warming properties as it sits.  Overall, this is a great beer. I recommend it for strong-flavored cuisine like mediterranean food or kebabs.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,dbalsock,4.4,"App: Pours a clear light amber with a thick white head and big carbonation bubbles. there's some lacing, but it's uneven and strange looking.  Smell: Great flowery and fruity hops mix with a fruity malt profile. I can pick up melon and caramel, in a similar way that I can while tasting a maibock... but this is still way different.  Taste: Melon again, with hops on the aftertaste, as would be expected. Very malty and very sweet compared to the west coast DIPA's i've been drinking lately. The hops aren't very present until the aftertaste, but they do provide some floral highlights throughout the sip.  Mouthfeel: Bitterness is less than usual for the style, but it builds and is a pleasant balance to the sweet, creamy malt profile.  Drinkability: Very drinkable for a dipa, and not as rough on the palate as some, making it easy to consume.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,Pitmonkey,4.06,"Since I am new to reviewing, I wanted to try reviewing two beers at once so I had some kind of control to work against. I happened to have 2 Imperial IPAs on hand, Tyranena Hop Whore and 90 Minute. This may be totally wrong, but I comparing them, side by side as I write up the reviews. I did however taste them separately.  A- Deep clear amber with copper hue. Poured from 12 oz bottle into .4l Mack Arctic Beer tulip glass. Aggressive pour netted a finger of head which quickly dissipated into a fairly dense cap, no lacing to speak of.  S- Some hop, surprisingly not a lot. As I work down the glass, sweet alcohol aromas become pronounced.  Taste- Malt sweetness followed quickly by the bitterness of hops. Not overpowering, very well balanced with a powerful alcohol kick taking over toward the end.  Mouthfeel- Its a mouthful of well rounded malt and hop which is followed by a strong alcohol sweetness and a very dry finish.  Drinkabililty- Probably one of the most drinkable Imperial IPAs I have tried. In that I mean it is well balanced and not mouth puckering. Which in a way is why I wouldnt necessarily revisit this beer. I expect bigger things from an Imperial at this price.  Paid 10.99 for a 4 pack.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S: Hops, touch of malt, oranges, apples, and other citrus, and oddly enough olive oil.  T: Awesome citrus hoppiness with hints of malt, oranges, and fresh grains. Finishes really dry. And again I get a sharp olive oil flavor thats really good.  M: Awesome A one and superb. I've been super lucky in this field as of late. Its really creamy and not a bit watery. A touch oily. It has great body and feel in the mouth (thats what she said).  D: This beer is Yummy drink it.. I can't wait to try the 120 minute.

10099,2093,beerbutcher,4.47,"i've had this beer stashed away for about a year now.. sooo curious!! it seems like a sin to sacrifice fresh hops for malt, but everybody already knows what a fresh one tastes like..  pours deep reddish-gold with an off white head almost two fingers deep which stands for a minute.  aroma has a deep dried fruit component layered over fruit brandy with a beautiful caramel malt backbone.phenolics are pungent and almost sting the nose, i love it!  taste is broadly malty, biscuity and cakey, wtih an fresh leafy edge to the intense hop bite which is quite resinous, piney, and citric, on the grapefruit rind side of things. finish is expansive, rich, balanced and slightly warming. hops never leave go, long after the beer and alcohol fade.  mouthfeel- no doubt it's slightly sweet, a rich and full bodied ale. The significant hop presence and refreshing quality of the alcohol hold it all together nicely. Obviously not for the who cannot appreciate hops, but for the hop heads, it's dead on.  drinkability- this one will slow you down, but it has incredible balance and nuance. i could drink this stuff daily.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,morimech,4.35,"I had to travel to Wisconsin to get this beer. It better be as good as advertised.  Pours a clear, reddish-copper with a flothy off-white head that almost spills over the top of the glass. The head settles down but maintains its presence thoughout the session. Leaves slight lacing.  It smells of citrus and piney hops. I don't get too much else in the nose. I smelled better IPAs.  This beer tastes very balanced. It starts off with a nice hop bite but mellows quickly to slight pine and malt tastes. Leaves with a little alcohol kick. It is medium body with good carbonation, strike that, great carbonation. A lot of brewers could learn a lot about that from this brew. I could drink many of these and end up in a stupor if I wasn't careful and showed moderation.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

A: Transparent amber hue with roughly a finger and a half of dense, white head. Great retention and lacing, with a few hop flakes in the beer.  S: Very floral and citrusy hop profile in the nose, which dominates, but still a sweet and mellow side as well. Definitely amped up and fresh as all hell due to the Randall.  T: An immaculate hop presence, absolutely unbelievable through the Randall. Has nearly every kind of hop flavor imaginable, citrusy but still very mellow, with a certain sweetness to it. Good malt backing that keeps this beer in check.  M: Creamy mouthfeel with a solid amount of carbonation, a real treat in terms of texture.  D: Astonishing. This beer as a drinkability that is out of this world when poured through the Randall. Already an outstanding beer in its own right, this method of serving only increases the freshness and hop flavors already present.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,tronester,4.41,"Pours a golden orange with a big white head. Smells of citrus hops. Taste is very malty to begin with, a biscuity flavor. Then the hops. Very well balanced, floral. You can definitely taste the dry hopping here. The carbonation levels are just right. One of the best double IPAs.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,imasickboy,4,"Poured a very smooth amber color. It was almost syrupy. Fine, creamy head, which left a decent lacing as the glass went down.  Smells a bit sweet, which is encouraging for an IPA, IMO, with just a little bitter smell to it. Hop aroma is strong, yet not overwhelming. There's more to this one that just the hops.  Very smooth in the mouth, likely due to the fine carbonation. A decent bitterness to it, yet not overpowering like you might expect with a DIPA.  Tasted exactly how it smelled, slightly sweet, yet not malty, a palatable amount of bitterness, and the expected hop flavor. It gathers a more ""fresh"" hop taste as it warms, and gets a very well-blended taste/feel to it. The sweetness of the malt seems to fit right in with the hops.  Very drinkable, despite the ABV. I must be careful with this one in the future.  Other thoughts: Beats the hell out of their 60 minute IPA, when it comes to flavor, IMO.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Musky,4.77,"Pours with a beautiful bouquet of hop aroma that intoxicates the drinker. Has a nice head that will lace the glass as you drink down this homage to the beer gods. It is malty smooth with a hop bite towards the back of the palate, which is not usual for a 90 IBU beer. The maltiness can completely backup the high IBU rating. This is an extremely smooth IPA that is worth anyones time.  Cheers",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,mattster,3.81,"Bottled on 26 April 2007; side poured into a stemless wineglass. Very light head that disappears in less than a minute, some lacing on glass.  Smell is great, but nothing outwardly discernable. Beautiful dark brown hazy in glass with good bubble appearance after pouring.  Taste is quite hoppy - hence the 90 minuted dry hopping. Some dried citrus rind taste with slight herbal overtones. Wonderful mouthfeel = very similar to a full-bodied red wine; It even leaves small legs on the sides of the glass. The bubbles are pleasant in the mouth and don't attack the palate.  I first tried this beer a year ago, and could only drink one. This evening it was enjoyed by itself as well (no more left). This beer would be excellent with curries or strong stinky cheases.

10099,2093,emerge077,3.83,"2006 bottle.  Into a fluted Ommegang glass, a good pour results in two fingers of foam and a convex puff that threatens to spill over. High-clarity reddish amber jewel tone.  Aroma is fairly subdued, a bit herbal and vegetal, with some underlying citrus like dried grapefruit rinds.  Lush mouthfeel, palate-coating and fully enveloping.That's really it's finest quality. Slightly sticky sweet. Strong and dry in the finish, a little spicy, more than a hint of the high abv. There's an underlying chalky & herbal aftertaste. The flavor has the obligatory pine and citrus, certainly full-flavored, but not pushing the envelope to me. It's huge and hoppy, but doesn't stand above the pack of other IIPA's out there.  2nd bottle: 10/07 bottling date, same review applies. 12/07",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,N8TheGreat,4.38,Served in a snifter at 50 degrees  Poured a deep amber with almost a hint of rose. Unremarkable head. Citrus and pine aromas mingle with a rich sweetness. First sip is rewarded with thick chunk of malt in the mouth as the strong pine and citrus flavors emerge and complement. Alcohol elements are present as well and blend nicely with the sweetness of the malt. A testament to balance in a DIPA.

It crawls down to quarter-inch.  Hops are major in this aroma, also smells of pine. Bits of honey, bits of brown sugar, grapefruit??? Very pleasant smell.  Citrus attack! Immediate assault on the palatte. Hops take over after and the sweeter tastes come out in the finish. Slightly tangy, like lemons or grapefruit with hints of pepper.

Has an amber color, the head is fluffy and creamy with an abundance of lacing around the glass as it settles.  Smells of piny hop oils ( a lot of hop trademarks), floral and grassy with a sweet caramel like malt.  Tastes sweet and hoppy. Pine, citrus and a warming alcohol that is well hidden but starts coming through as the beer warms.

S- Smells sweet and very piney, pretty characterstic of a DIPA, nothing too out of the ordinary but solid none the less.  T- tastes of black liquorice, subdued piney hoppy tones, hints of alcohol.  M- A bit thick for my liking but it complements the taste well. Medium carbonation.  D- This is a sipper to be sure. I am digging the taste because of how different it is from cookie cutter DIPAs but it is thick and definitely coats your mouth. Not the most drinkable DIPA in the world but very solid.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,MICAMD,3.2,"A- This is as clear as it gets. A perfectly clear coppery liquid fills the glass with a tiny white head that settles to a thin covering and a tiny ring where the beer meets the glass. Looks kind of flat and bland.  S- Even when warmed, I can't get a lot out of this. Some pine and citrus with a strong malt backing. The alcohol is definitely noticeable in the nose, but it is not too harsh. It has some aroma to it, but not like some other DIPA's I've had.  T- Some piney hops and a good caramel malt backing. This does have a kick to it, but half of that can be attributed to the alcohol bite. Some strong hops up front with a the malt to smooth things out on the finnish.  M- Very dry and tangy. The hops are sure getting the job done here. There is still something missing for me.  D- This is decent, but by no means spectacular. This is my sixth bottle of this stuff and I seem to enjoy it a little less every time. A quality beverage, but is not my favorite for the style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Nice frothy off-white head with mostly fine bubbles that cling to the glass. Head settled to a thin layer that sticks around for the duration. This is a pretty beer!  This is an outstanding scent! I could savor this for a while. Like a walk through a pine forest after a rain. Love it!!! Maybe some very pleasant citrus tones as well. mmm...  WOW! This is strong... and really good! Yes, I like this a lot! Definitely the pine/citrus flavor that I detected from the smell. This is GOOD hoppy beer. Only slight bitterness... way less than I expected.  Smooth fine feel, almost perfect.  This is most definitely an exceptional sipping/smelling beer... needs to be looked at, swirled a bit, and savored. I wouldn't want to chug this.

10099,2093,akorsak,4.67,"Served on tap at Sun Dog's in Corolla, NC in a DFH stange.  A: The ale is amber brown, darn near indistunguishable from an amber bottle. As light shines through, a brilliant clarity emerges showing off no imperfections. To top the whole appearance off, a thick band of lace dries throughout the glass as I consume it.  S: The nose is citrusy goodness, all hops and no filler. The aromas are intense and can't hide the big alcohol that supports all those hops.  T: First sip is cringe-worthy. The hops are so strong that they easily overwhelm the tastebuds. Their flavor is cirusy, full of grapefruit, tangerine and orange peel flavors. The bitterness defines the whole taste, hoppy from start to finish. The hops are matched, almost dollar-for-dollar against hot alcoholic heat. The malt body doesn't make much noise, serving only to support the hops. This is a hophead's salvation.  M: The malts lack a backbone, adding a measure of balance to the ale only. That's okay though because the hop profile is big and delicious, with citrus notes making their presence known early on. This beer is a perfect representative of the American style of brewing.  D: The alcohol body is huge but the hop profile is revolutionary. This is, to me, one of the early entrants in the American IPA market (double, single or triple even). It is a gold standard and worth a sip, especially if it is fresh.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Appearance- Pours a beautiful yellowish orange with a huge billowy alabaster head. Recedes very slowly leaving an awesome cap and collar. Leaves thick web like lacing all the way down the side of the glass. Smell- Holy Cow! When I pour this thing Im hit with gobs of fruit. Grapefruit, apricot, peaches, tangerines Basically any citrus fruits. So hoppy, alcoholic and delicious. Sweet undertones of caramel malt try to cut the hops but are not very successful. Taste- Much like the 60 Minute IPA I was expecting a lot bigger hoppyness but this one is much closer to the nose than was the 60 minute. Starts with sweet toffee malts that remind me a lot of caramel corn that slowly gives way to the big hop underneath. Fruity and piney, they leave a resounding bitterness that I really really like. The alcohol also has a big presence here but is kept under control. Mouthfeel- Thick without being syrupy. Very full with small prickly carbonation. Drinkability- This brew is big and tasty and goes down really really easy for having 9% abv. Ive yet to have the 120 minute IPA but I know that I like the 90 minute much more than the 60 minute.

Shorter head than expected with medium lacing.  S- Sweet fruity hops jump out from the get-go. Smells of sour green apples and sugary raisins. Peppers background, not as much as I expected.  T/M: Lotsa hops hit you, as expected. Some toasty malts, followed by powder sugar. Finish dry at the very end. It's a little heavier than I expected but not at all abrasive. Toward the bottom the alcohol comes out a bit and leaves an inviting warmth. Carbonation was on the weak side, which I think a little more would have been nice.

S: A great aroma. Floral and fruity hop aroma, quite nice. More floral and fruity than citrusy. Malty sweetness is strong- balances well. Malt aroma smells sugary sweet like cotton candy.  T: Wonderfully overpowering citrus grapefruit flavor. Strong sugary sweet malt flavor provides great balance. Boozy and perhaps a little alcohol/yeast derived fruitiness.  MF: Medium body.

Smell-All malt and Dank Citrusy hops. A sweet and almost spicy hop aroma tickled my nose.  Taste- Boosch bang. Huge malt profile upfront and an amazingly balanced hop bitterness make this beer almost too easy to drink. At 9% abv it's got an alarmingly nice warm alcoholic and biscuity taste with hops that provide a tangy resiny & slightly spicy finish.  Mouthfeel- Full bodied and bitter from the beginning to end. citrusy, chewy, malty, sweet-almost honey like.  Drinkability- Again at 9% oddly enough it is an easy drinker.

Heravy pine and citrus typical of the style with a hint of smoked peet and alchohol. Medium to thick body on the tongue. Fooled me! Was expecting an overly hopped one sided taste but was pleased with the hop/ malt balance- sweet- yet ballsy.

At first touch, I taste a sweet candy almost buttery in fact. A rush of hops follows and lingers as I still try and pick out other tastes.

To much hops and nothing to balance it with. D: Not bad considering this beer is 9% abv.  I loved almost everything about this beer except the tast. There are just too much hops.

Unreal experience...bring on the Brew Fest!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,saintwarrick,4.55,"This beer pours clear orange with a big ole hoppy head that is sticky and laces your glass the whole way down. Wow, the aroma can be smelled in another room. Big hops and a nice bready, sweet malt characteristic also; big-time pine syrup and very thick hop oils in there as well -- even actual hops oils dont smell this oily. Taste is dry and sweet, piney with hops coming out the ying-yang. Finish is dry and sweet, but not too sweet.  I still prefer its more drinkable little brother if I am going to have more than one, but there is no denying this is a masterful brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,slagle9480,4.17,"A: Amber color with a nice fluffy head.  S: Best part of this beer IMO. The hops are definitely floral. The malt also smells great.  T: I love the hops but the malts make this brew syrup-y. Probably caramel or somethin. Nothin like I anticipated.  M: The mouthfeel was interesting. It was warm and inviting at times. Some parts were too syrup-y though. The longer I let it sit...wow!  D: The malts are strong. I would've liked to see less malt and more hops. I wouldn't classify this as a session beer. Overall, not bad.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,LeftyBWS,4.82,"On tap at D's Six Pax & Dogz, east Pittsburgh, PA. This has been one of my favorite beers for a while, but I'd never had it on tap before. It was everything I remembered it to be, and then some. Poured a delicious-looking orange-gold color with a thick layer of sticky tan head that had very nice lacing all the way down the glass. The smell was very hoppy with some fruity scents. I'm not sure what types of hops they use, and I'm sure it's a mix, but whatever it is, it's perfectly balanced; a good amount of kick but not overpoweringly so. The taste is much like the smell, with some extra bite in the mouth from the hops. The bitter hop flavor persists throughout the taste but goes through varying levels of intensity; an interesting ride. The aftertaste is smooth yet complex, nippy yet comforting. Every time I put the glass down, I want to pick it up again. All in all, a great beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,hellcatsjg,4.8,"Appearance: Amber color with a nice head that leaves a ton of lacing as you go. No complaints here.  Smell: Nice citrusy/hoppy smell. Does a good job getting you ready for the first sip.  Taste: This is where this beer gets you. A mixture of citrus, flowers, hops, and Dogfish's trademark sweetness makes this a tremendous beer. The aftertaste is sweet at first which then gives way to a perfect amount of bitter hops.Each flavor is balanced perfectly making this one of the best tasting beers I have ever had.  Mouthfeel: Nice and smooth. Just thick enough to let the flavor linger until your next sip.  Drinkability: As stated above, one of my favorites. While not an IPA fan, this beer is near perfect. The 9% might limit how many you can have in a sitting, but this beer has no downside to it whatsoever. Near perfection here.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,HopDerek,4.62,"Pours a deep amber color with burnt sienna hues in the light. A good inch of cream colored head fades nicely leaving nice lacing. Smells are of sweet malt and barley, citrus, pine, and grass with some alcohol burn. Taste is very similar, sweet barley and malt up front before a plethora of citrus and grassy tones finishes off with a good sticky adherence to the palate. Very nicely balanced and medium in body with good carbonation. A highly drinkable IPA loaded with flavor and balance, though with the abv so high, it's not sessionable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,jdoncbus,4.47,"12 oz. bottle poured into tulip glass. Appearance is dark, gold with active carbonation. Small, tan colored head with impressive lacing.  Smell is earthy barley with citrus notes blasting at the nose. Orange, pineapple is made out with a rustic, almost cinnamon fragerance.  Very crisp on the tounge where the barley comes out strong followed by the hops which builds into a fantastic finish that lingers plesantly for some time. The solid alcohol presence is not very noticable in the flavor though it says ""hello"" with a warm stream down the throat.  A chewy beer that excites the palette and top of the mouth with a mild numbness and bitter feel.  I have enjoyed this one for a few years and pick up a 4-pack ($9.99) 4-5 times a year. If you are looking to enjoy a complex beer and need to relax, look no further. The beer should be nursed and savored, a great choice to start off the night.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

M: the hops absolutely stay and almost effervesce on the back of the tounge. the front of the mouth is almost shocked into submission  D: not as dry and hoppy as some other Double/Imperial IPA's, so it's possible to drink a couple in a night. However, and this is the big part, at a big, but sneaky 9% ABV, the question of whether you would want to/could drink this all night is something that will weigh on you  Notes: I had this on tap a week-and-a-half ago at Tria and it was not nearly as hoppy, it more smooth, the alcohol less pronounced, the head greater, more lasting; the bottle seems to bring out the hops and the alcohol.

10099,2093,feilb,4.42,"Well, what to say about this great bottle.  The pour: Pours a medium amber color with a fluffy cream colored head that lasts a few minutes, not to bad for 9% abv. Makes for an attractive presentation and really displays the aroma.  The smell: Hops. Not that you were expecting different, but the sweet floral citrus aroma of this beer lets you know that its coming.  The taste: With such a strong component of hops, one would expect a strong bitter taste, which is present, but this beer also delivers some interesting notes. Slightly sweet with notes of honey the spicy flavor of cloves. Interestingly, very smooth, though with a slight astringency from the alcohol, though only briefly as it finishes.  The feel: Smooth, not to heavy, and a bit dry on the finish.  Drinkability: Definitely not your ""session"" beer, though it drinks smooth and isn't to much of a fight like some IPA's that display only the bitterness. About one will set you well for a while.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S- very complex sweet fruitiness like pear or apple, resinous herbs, sticky hops toasty malt, cleanser, alcohol, and something i can't quite put my finger on.  T- earthy piney fruity pineapple apricot alcohol with a definite yeasty twang. oily resinous hops, burnt marshmallows, caramelized malts, and a cake icing sugar syrup type finish that was sweeter than i am used to, followed by a lingering bitter hop aftertaste.  MF- warm feeling from the first sip. oily, dry and thick feeling with great carbonation, all the hops give me a pucker. very syrupy, which is probably unavoidable when making a beer of this nature.  D- too sweet of an ipa for my taste. i prefer to go without that sugar sweetness that this ale possesses. the aroma of this beer is truly remarkable and i expected it to carry over into the taste. i realize however that there are many different versions of american ipa and this one was undoubtedly made with integrity.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,franksnbeans,4.5,"Served to me a clean dark orange/amber with a creamy head that goes away slowly. Smells of exquisite floral hops, grapefruit, some malt and a hint of fig. Tastes like freshly cut piney hops, citrusy rind with no sign of the alcohol. Right before the punch of hops seems over the top the malt quickly balances it out in perfect fashion. Finishes deliciously, hoppy dry and bitter with excellent carbonation. Drinks as smooth as a babys bottom. An excellent choice and a must try.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,cameraman,4.7,"A light golden to amber color with a half inch off white colored head forming on top. Surprisingly a strong malt fragrance at first scent, followed by a combination citrus, pine and grassy fragrances at the end. The taste starts out with the malt coming right out, and then blending itself to a strong citrus flavor, hints of a grassy flavor as well. A very well balanced flavor. A medium bodied feel, that never loses that texture all the way across the palate. This is one of the best IPA's I have ever had, and incredibly well balanced flavor and strong aroma, I longing for another glass.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,drumrboy22,4.35,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a Harpoon IPA glass.  Amber/Copper colored beer with a large, rocky, off-white head. Lasted for a while, with minimal lacing around the glass.  Aroma was sweet malt, citrusy hops and mild caramel.  Taste matched the aroma. Fairly bitter, but also well balanced by the malt. Strong alcohol flavor and fairly thick tasting beer. Consistency was thick, almost like a syrup.  I love this beer. It's fairly bitter, but again, it's very well balanced. It's nice to sip and enjoy in the summertime. Not as drinkable as the 60 Minute, just because of the bitterness and high alcohol content. But still, drinkability is high and it's a phenomenal beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,beeragent,4.24,"The beer pours a deep amber, forming a very thin head, with light lacing. The aroma is fantastic! A mix of hops, caramel, and alcohol. The taste is just like the aroma, consisting of hops, followed by some dark fruit flavors, caramel, and finishing with a light noticeable alcohol presence. Very rich and complex. The mouthfeel is very thick and smooth. If it were'nt for the high abv., this would be a great sessionable ale due to its extremely delicious flavor. Overall, I was very impressed with this brew. I expected an overpowering hopped up brew, but instead got a very rich flavorfull well-balanced brew. I would highly recommend trying this one!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,DrinkinBuddy,4.23,"Pours a dark copper tone with an incredibly thick head with great retention. Lacing stays with the entire way down. Smell of coffee and citrus blend is present. Taste is definately of coffee with a touch of caramel and a slight citrus hop backing that doesn't last like I expected. Taste resorts back to malt and doesn't leave a bitter after thought I was hoping. Mouthfeel is where this one doesn't quite do it for me. Thick syrup-like mouthfeel that doesn't make this one the easiest drinker. As it warms, the alcohol taste really starts to break through. Drink this one nice and cold, don't let it sit around too much, and you'll really enjoy this DIPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,frankbro,4.28,"Deep amber color that has a reddish hue. Head that sticks around and incredible lacing, it trails down the glass and remains when the glass is empty. The smell is more malt than hops and hints at Sam Adams Triple Bock.(My 4 cases just recently ended) The taste is more of hops, but the syrupy sweetness of malt is still there. You can taste the alcohol, too. The mouthfeel is rich and substantial, fresh baked bread. Drinkability is good, but not for chores. Especially with power tools. Buy often!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,sessycuban,3.06,"Purchased from Lone Hill Liquors.  A - The beer pours a beautiful copper. I'm getting about an inch of head with good lacing.  S - I'm getting a lot more caramel malts than hops which is quite the surprise, given most reviews of this beer. This is definitely not what I've come to expect from a DIPA.  T - The beer has an overwhelmingly sweet, almost syrupy, taste. The hops are not very apparent compared to the sweetness of the malt. The alcohol is very pronounced, although it is masked by the sweetness. This tastes more like a barley wine than a DIPA.  M - The mouthfeel is very syrupy. The alcohol taste is pronounced much like a tanic wine, which is weird for a beer.  D - Given many of the taste and aroma profiles, I think this beer takes a hit on drinkability. It's so sweet and alcoholic that it almost comes across as a barley wine. Nonetheless, this is a good beer that I recommend. I certainly preferred the 60 Minute IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Some nutty, roasted malts in the finish. Slightly fruity. Excellent feel, oily, smooth, velvety, but ends slightly dry. Somewhat heavy, flavorful, sipping style.

Mouthfeel: Light-Medium Body, Much Alcohol Bite. Oily/Filmy. Finish Not Nearly as Clean as I'd Have Liked.  Drinkability: 1 was Enough for me. Definately a Sipping Beer. Did enjoy the Cool Buzz.

Roasty, sweet malt with pine-like and slightly citrusy hops.  Caramel, toffee, creme brulee with a mostly piney and herbally but a tad bit of citrus hop on the finish.

S - Snappy floral hops assail the nose (pine, grass) laid on top of a caramel, even slightly chocolatey(?) malty backbone.  M - Thick, creamy mouthfeel that's at once chewy and silky.  T - Probably one of the finest IPA's I've had. Deep, buttery malts canvassing the array of hops that coat your mouth long after you've finished the bottle. Supremely balanced, fresh, and delicious.  D - As you can tell by the gushing review, this is one of my go-to IPAs; a beer that's spicy enough to satisfy the hophead yet creamy enough to placate the malt man in us all. The drinkability only suffers in that its masked ABV prevents any sessionability.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Smixam,3.96,"4 Pack of bottles, poured into a pint glass.  First impressions - wow, this is a perfect looking American craft beer. Really nice moderately dark amber/gold coloring, 1-2 finger off-white head. It looks like it should be in show business. The smell is interesting - it's very strong at first, due to the relatively high alcohol content, but then the other aromas, hops, malt, and a bit of citrus come through and it becomes really inviting.  The flavor is a lot like the smell - at first it's just hops hammering your taste buds, then it backs off really nicely and you can taste the malt and the citrus undertones. At the end, it finishes by letting you know this is a 9% abv brew, and then it's clean. Because of the high alcohol content and the heavy hops, this isn't my idea of a session beer, but it's a great companion to a good meal or to enjoy by itself. If you want better drinkability, go with the 60 minute. This one is for the true IPA lovers - and it's a really great American craft beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,BucBasil,3.97,"Appearance: Poured from a bottle into a pint glass... A great looking deep amber color with a one finger head that quickly dissipates. Classic looking crew, but nothing special.  Smell: Sweet hoppy goodness dominates the nose. Aside from the hops, nothing else really has the chance to shine through... there;s a slight metallic undertone, but nothing distracting.  Taste: An explosion of hops punches you right in the face after the fisrt sip. Puckeringly bitter at first glance, but as the beer warms the brew becomes more and more balanced. A bit of citrus shines through with some barley coming in at the midpalate. Everything else is hops, hops, and more hops. They weren't kidding when theyh said this thing was continuously hopped for 90 minutes. Unmistakable hop dominance throughout.  Mouthfeel: Lightly prickly carbonation throughout. Carbonation does not die off quickly. Pretty refreshing, but fuller-bodied than what I was expecting. Punches you right in the bck of the throat immediately...  Drinkability: The bitterness of this one makes this less drinkable in my opinion, but some people like that. I'm more of a malt fan, but for those that like really up front, punch-you-in-the-mouth beers, this is for you. I actually think this is more balanced than the more widely known 60 Minute IPA, since there is some malt evident.

10099,2093,Windigstadt,4.5,"A: Beautiful topaz color; very clear. S: My first response was that it wasn't as hoppy as I would expect. Certainly you have the piny and citrusy notes of northwest pacific hops, but you also have peach, honey and bubblegum aromas as well. T: You get a slightly tart, acidic feel on the top of your tongue at first, with a honeylike sweetness that gives way to a resiny, bitter finish. While the flavor of grapefruit rind lingers after you swallow, so does the sweet, almost caramel-like maltiness. For something that has a reputation as a hop bomb, it's very well balanced. M: Appropriately carbonated--light but not too light. D: Wouldn't have guessed this was 9%.  Overall: as somebody who is not a hophead and rarely reaches for an IPA, this was a very pleasant surprise. Much in the same way that I think the best barleywines have a nice bitter finish to lend some balance, this XIPA has enough malty sweetness to stand up to the IBU's.

The only other DFH I've been lucky enough to get my hands on was Raison D'etre at Stone's outfit in Escondido. It is now poured, and sitting before me, foamy, relentless head perched maginficently upon it's orange/copper shoulders. Smell is alive, sweet creme brulee and brilliant piney hops. An enviable balance is acheived in the flavor, and though there are no surprises that deviate from what's suggested by the nose, it's wonderful. The mouthfeel isn't luxurious, it's luxury itself, with a deeply satisfng warm finish. All this, and it manages to be incredibly refreshing.

10099,2093,TheClassical,4.32,"Being from Delaware, I've had the chance to sample a lot of Dogfish Head's best ales. I've been down to the restaurant, toured the brewery, knocked back some samples of 90 Minute at various beerfests, and had the pleasure of drinking the 90 Minute fresh from the tap. Just so you know where I'm coming from: I really like how Dogfish does their IPAs, and this may be my favorite. But I wanted to review a bottle, to see if it can match the draught I've previously enjoyed. And so, from a cold 355mL/12oz bottle and into a glass mug ...  A thick creamy warm foamy head dissipates in a slow burn around the perimeter of the glass, large bubbles yawning as it simmers but never settling, maintaining the creamy head. The head continues in a thick, pulpy foam halfway through the beer, the copper colors looking rich against the white head.  Smell is hoppy, fruity, and a metallic smell faintly discernable. The smell lets you know that this is going to be a hoppy mouthful. A subtle fruit note hangs on to the edge of the smell, promising a really complex taste. I don't know if I lingered over the smell too much, because I woldn't exactly call it complex (just a lot of hops!), but it's a smell that got me excited to plunge into this beer. A musky oak, maybe, but that fruity tinge is unmistakable, always undercutting any prevailing scent to remind you that this will be flavorful. Scorching charcoal? Maybe, maybe not.  Taste ... ahh, how nice. An instant hoppy bite on the palette, but a smooth and tempered followup that doesn't overindulge in the bitter hops. They're there to be sure, but what could be overpowering turns out upon tasting to be well balanced and measuered.  Mouthfeel is bitter, but not biting; dry but not scorching; powerful but not overpowering. There's a lingering sweetness after a generous swallow that plays well off the bitter front. There's an unmistakable creaminess and fullness in the mouth, resplendant flavor at each step of the sip, that makes this feel like a real hearty drink. Each sip feels really balanced as well, nothing too overpowering that makes me taste the high alcohol. Maybe picking nits, but the beer is a little dry toward the end.  Drinkability is fantastic. I'd love another. Especially having had this beer fresh on tap at the DFH brewpub, I know how good this beer can taste fresh, and this bottled incarnation is damn near perfect. The hops are a little stale by the end, and the maltiness never diminishes, but it's a solid drink that never lets up in delicious intensity or fullness. The high alcohol content could be a turnoff, but the taste is so rich and balanced that there should be no problems slowly sipping and enjoying a few of these.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

A- An absolutely gorgeous copper. As close to the actual color as I have seen. The head is a half inch thick and white. Lacing follows this one in a clean glass all the way down.  S- A strong aroma of Pineapple hits me first, and makes me want to dive right in. THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS CONSIDERING THE ALCOHOL! On the back notes dance malt and Simcoe hops.  T- Well to say the the malt hits fast and hard would be an understatement. Very sweet, but the balance is there. The next is the fragrent aroma of the purest west coast hops that you have have ever had. Citrus bursts through, then spiciness. There is a cutting bitter and alcohol that balances everything.  M- WOW! Talk about the full experience. It has a velvet malt mouthfeel. With the roll onto your back palate with a balance of bitter. IT IS VERY FULL AND VERY FILLING!  D- O DEAR LORD! This one is so drinkable and so smooth that I have had the worst night of my life on this one. I remember showing up at SALT in D.C., with no reservation, and sitting at the bar slamming them back.

The taste mimics the smell mouth puckering bitterness from the citrus hops but the beer is sweet enough that the bitterness doesn't overwhelm. Also the alcohol is very well hidden by the sharp bitterness I had to remind myself that this was a 9% beer to keep from drinking it too fast.

Give the glass a swirl and allow it to warm and the various flavors include: fresh malty wort, golden raisins, dried apricot, canned peach, caramel, sweet roll, sweet sticky citrus candy, fresh hop oil, pine, mint, alcohol phenols and various fruity esters and overtones. Wow, this is an IPA? Has more of an old ale or barlywine-like complexity. Or more like a belgian ale made with domestic yeast. I have sampled different stages of age and on-tap and this beer always tastes great. The 9%abv is most likely the reason it travels and ages so well. Would pair perfectly with an apricot glazed meat or fish dish. The hops and alcohol would cut through the sweetness while also matching the flavors.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Halcyondays,3.68,"12 oz. bottle,  A: Golden amber, with a thick white head, with very good retention.  S: Boozy, fruits of golden raisins, honey, and some grapes, very winey in a way.  T: Different than what I was expecting. Light fruity tastes, with a clear alcohol profile. Brandyish and phenolic. Tastes a lot like the 120 minute with a lot less alcohol, clearly very interesting.  M: I happen to like the mouthfeel a lot. Smooth, very smooth from the ethanol, creamy, almost medicinal.  D: This beer is strange, I thought it tasted a lot more like a barleywine than a 2IPA. Try it for yourself, it is definitely an intriguing brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,joekfsu,4.55,"12 oz bottle. Pours a clear amber with a 1.5 cm off white head (mostly diminishing). Moderately malty and slightly hoppy aroma with a tinge of citrus. The initial flavor is mostly sweet with the citrus and hoppiness kicking in on the back end. Creamy texture with light carbonation. I just saw that this beer is 294 calories per bottle, wow, otherwise I wish I could drink this every day.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,ericj551,4.32,"Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA pours a slightly hazy orange gold with a one inch head that only sticks around for a minute. The aroma is fresh hops, and not much else. Bitter citrus, herbal and fruity hop aroma. The taste is a biter punch of hops, more citrus, grapefruity and slightly piney. The sweetness of the malt balances it well, however. Although hops are certainly the feature, sweet pale malt flavor really does a good job of making this one very drinkable. The alcohol is noticeable and slightly medicinal in the aftertaste, but not over the top for 9%.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,josiahschlender,4.72,"Expertly poured into a snifter at Henry's 12th Street Tavern in Portland. Props for great presentation. Big, attractive head that slowly dissipated but never quite went away despite taking my time to finish. Lots of sticky lace left behind. Clear, color is sightly dark, orange-tinged amber.  This is one of those beers you can smell from a distance. Explosive citric, fruity hops and sweet malts. I smell grapefruit, tangerine, caramel, a little bit of pine, raw sugar, and a little bit of alcohol. I'm a fan of the complexity.  Intensity and complexity rule with the flavors. Having not read any reviews before drinking this, I was surprised with how sweet and malty it was. I was expecting more of a hop bomb, but the hops gave way a bit to the sweetbread-like malts after experiencing the aroma. Maybe it's not that they gave way, it's just that I think the hops themselves even tended on the sweet side, almost like a slightly overripe grapefruit or orange. I can't believe the 90 IBUs this beer is supposed to have. It just didn't seem that bitter to me. The citric and slightly piney hops certainly were present, and had a great, lasting aftertaste.  Mouthfeel felt slick, full, and coated my mouth. Low carbonation, warming alcohol. It stuck around a while, keeping the flavors swirling for about as long as possible. Great for the complex flavors in this kind of beer.  While I still favor a hoppier IPA, I can't help but be impressed and admire this expertly crafted brew. So strong it can be too much of a good thing quickly, but I'm a sucker for its rich complexity.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,tapman,3.74,"Another DFH craft brew that everybody raves about.  Pours a light-colored, creamy head. Body color is not exactly golden, but softer like actual gold. Lacing retention is good.  Smells a sharp, flowery-citrus. This beer could be the American (cascade) hop poster-child. There is a strong enough barley malt back to support the hops making this brew much less tangy than anticipated which this malt-mouth prefers.  Taste is hoppy with alcohol; while the hops are sugary sweet, the alcohol overpowers it which is a constant I have found in many DFH beers, the large alcohol taste. Still just malty enough to satisfy which I suppose comes from the English Tow Row barley they use according to the label.  The carbonation is crispy and has a thick texture for an ale.  It's good, but like many expensive IPAs its kinda strong. If it were more hoppy than alcoholic then I might be more satisfied. Looks like its time for the 120 min IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,ChainGangGuy,4.17,"Appearance: Pours a clear copper body with a small, creamy white head.  Smell: Lavish, rich caramel maltiness with pronounced accents of pine, juicy citrus fruits, and dried pineapple.  Taste: The malt and hops march side-by-side along the tongue with lush sugary caramel sweetness and pineapple juice garnished with pine needles. Sweet-bitter finish, with the bitterness enduring into the aftertaste. The purported 90 IBUs can hardly be felt what with all this rich, malty sweetness within. The ABV, though apparent, thankfully isn't glaring.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel. Quite warming.  Drinkability: I'd recommend a 7-day 90 Minute Imperial IPA Diet. Go ahead, blow your mind once a day for the next week.

10099,2093,Cath0de,4.32,"Look: Small but present off-color white head with minimal lacing (but then again I think this glass might be a bit oversoaped...) on top of a pretty, clear red-golden body. A rather pretty IPA...  Smell: Surprisingly malty for an IPA...at least for my tastes...caramel, honey, and alcohol on top of pleasant pine and orange peel. A pretty balanced nose.  Taste: Taste echoes smell...good malt backbone of caramel and toast complemented by high quality and to be honest rather subdued hop notes. A overly strong alcohol bite intrudes a bit much on an otherwise balanced and high quality palate.  Feel: Again, the alcohol asserts itself here a bit much for my liking, but the mouthfeel is slick and tasty.  Drink!: It's an IIPA, but still has a remarkably subdued yet complex palate that does not dominate the taste buds. Rather drinkable, but certainly not sessionable at 9% ABV.   Overall: An interesting approach to the IIPA with pronounced malt elements and alcohol bite...not terribly bitter but high quality piney hops make it an interesting choice for hop-heads.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,ghostmech007,4.8,"On-tap at the Dogfish Head Ale House into a snifter.  Dark amber coloring. Head is off white and creamy and stays forever! Lots of lacing.  Nice nose full of spices. Floral, herbal, and malts. Love to still smell it.  The taste... oh the taste. Smooth but chewy, with a palate that is perfect. Hops are present everywhere, very bitter, with citrus notes and hop oils, leafty hops and a blend of characters that just makes me want to drink more. You really can't taste the malts because of the hops but you still get a bready note every once in a while. But the one thing that always stands out in this one is the OH. It feels warm going down and makes you smell like a wino. The finish is superb, caramel and yeast notes with a very dry finish. Might be the best tasting IPA anywhere, but the thing is I have tried drinking two in one sitting and I can't. It's not a problem of taste or anything, it just fills me up way to much.  This in my book is the best tasting IPA ever. Not just doubles or imperials but any IPA. 'Nough said.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Glazed144,4.38,"Amazing beer. A very full hops presence, verging on overwhelming, but not quite.

Lace covers most of glass.  It tastes sweeter than expected. Also more fruit than expected. Good malt character. Alcohol makes it's presence known. I swear that I'm tasting some honey-dew melon...as wierd as that may be. Hops are very well pronounced, but well balanced with the malt as well. Lots of grassy flavours going on. Citrus flavours present... but mostly on the finish. Very close to an English-style IPA in my opinion. A lot going on on the palate.  Mouthfeel is average for an IPA. Medium-full bodied. Avg. carbonation. Alcohol felt in the mouth.  Overall, I think it's a great discovery and a complex brew.

A medium-bodied beer.  D - Wow! This really is good. It is the first DIPA I've had that wasn't very bitter at all.

The color is a lovely red-gold, without a lot of head unless you pour it hard. The aroma is very potent, with an almost tart-apple/tangerine cross that is new to me. BIG hops, and big kick, but these are not as up-front if it is cold.

10099,2093,becktone,4.8,"Eye: Plenty of eye candy here. Crystal clear light copper with yellow highlights, this beer shows off its attractive carbonation. The head is stable with some nice lacing, very creamy in appearance.  Nose: Huge hop aroma in this Double IPA. Floral and grassy notes are very evident. Thank the hop gods for this one. Smells great. Reminds me of opening a fresh bag of hops when I brew and stick my nose in the bag before adding them to the brew.  Tongue: YEAH!!! Just what I was looking for. Great hop character right up front, all over. Bittering hops make themselves known right away as the brew first hits the tongue. Then there is a cascade of cascade...good pun. Some sweet malts make it through in between the hop flavors, but then get shoved to the background again as the finishing hops come out to play. Hop character in this brew is citrus, floral and grass influenced. Only characteristic I don't like about this beer is that there's not much of an aftertaste.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability: This is one damn good beer. That is not an opinion, this is not open for discussion. Very nice full mouthfeel, creamy and smooth...they don't get much better than this. I'll definitely be buying this one again, would like to see how the bottles compare, would also like to try this brew's sister IPAs-60, 75, and 120.

10099,2093,bluemoonswoon,4.05,"12oz bottle poured into snifter. Beer pours a dark and clear amber with a tan head that reduces to a thin ring around the glass. Minimal lacing.  Big floral hop aroma (obviously) but there are big malt scents along with nuts and coffee on the back end, not like other ipas I've tried before but is my first double ipa so these aromas might be a reflection of the style.  The taste is again something I'm not used to with other ipas but as this one's a double ipa I suppose that makes sense. Very ceamy mouthfeel that only gets creamier as it warms, not much carbonation to speak of. Big hop taste upfront and malts but the alcohol seems to destroy the other flavors, in fact drinking this leaves a little medicine aftertaste that lingers on the tongue. While it does taste incredibly juicy I can't really place a specific flavor, faint flavors of apple and pear are there but don't really seem to be doing anything, they just sort of hang around.  I had high hopes for this beer and was a bit dissapointed by it as I loved the 60 minute ipa, perhaps a little too much hop charter. A beer that needs to be tried at least once, but not so much after that, though I hope to try another double ipa so as to be able to compare the two.

Whiter lacy head.  Nose: Plenty of hops. A hint of malt in there. A bit of herbs. The citrus is a little milder than I remember from my last ""fresh"" bottle.  Taste: Nicely hopped, and yet not nearly as overwhelming as one might expect. Nor is it as bitter as some super-hopped beers, at least up front. The finish is still hop-bitter but also sweet and exposes the alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Almost oily, coats everything.  Drinkability: Surprisingly drinkable.

10099,2093,EagleAndChild,4.77,"Simply put (and obviously), this beer is my all-time favorite. In fact, this is the beer that initialized my interest in and appreciation of craft beers. I've had it many times, in many places and served in both bottle and tap, but for the sake of this review I'll refer to my consumption of it at McGrath's Pub in Harrisburg, PA.  Poured from tap and served in a pint glass, it has the nice couldy, dark golden color that a good double (or imperial) IPA should have.  The smell is fantastic! Very pleseant citrusy, piney aroma that comes from a well-hopped beer. Man, I wish I could get that scent in an air freshner!  The taste is one of which I can't get enough. Again, very well-hopped, but not very bitter at all. In fact there's a certain sweetness to it, almost syrupy... leaving an almost candied-citrus finish to it. Similarly, the mouthfeel is a little thick and syrupy. It's certainly not, how you say, ""fizzy yellow stuff.""  Drinkability is again terriffic, but this is by no means a session beer. Have just two and you're putting a fair amount of alcohol and about 600 calories into your body. If you're sitting at a bar and plan on driving home afterwards, beware... this one can creep up on you after only a few. I definitely recommend having this from a tap, but having something to eat with it is not a bad idea. I've found that it pairs well with fishes, pizzas, spicey cheeses and creamy soups. It's also fantastic out of a bottle, so if you can't find it on tap, getting a six-pack or a case and enjoying it at home is also highly recommended.  Enjoy!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

There is also an underlying spiciness. The hops are almost like a ruby red grapefruit type odor. This is a very clean smell.  T-The hops push their way to the forefront here, grapefruit and earth flavours here. The sweetness from the alcohol and malt is present but acts as a good counterpoint to the hop bitterness. There is a slight sting from the alcohol, but it isn't overbearing.  M-The pillowy head is very fluffy to get through and the mouthfeel is perfect for the style. Not too thick or thin, with a good dose of small bubbled carbonation.  D-This is a great 2XIPA. Very well balanced unlike alot of attempts at the style.

10099,2093,jmalex,4.11,"My second crack at this. Purchased at the Candlewyck in Buckingham, PA for what seems like chump change.  APPEARANCE: Pours a crystal clear amber with a nice half-finger off-white head. It hangs on for quite a while as a result of the large amount of cascading bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. Lacing is tremendous and comes in sheets.  SMELL: Mild piny, spicy, and pungent hops hit the nose first. Some sweet malt hides in the background, and hints of apricot also come out. Overall, a nice balance, but slightly underwhelming.  TASTE: The hops are sweet, citrusy, and piny and blend well with the rest of the beer. The malt background is excellent and is able to shine through as the beer crosses the palate. The finish is hoppy again with the same hops flavors lingering to the end. Balance in a double IPA? Believe it.  MOUTHFEEL: Medium bodied, if not a bit syrupy. Carbonation is a bit on the lighter side.  DRINKABILITY: The balance is exceptional and makes this one of the more drinkable DIPAs. A bit syrupy to be considered refreshing, but goes down nicely and the 9% ABV is hardly detectable. A great summer sipper.

S - bit of malt sweetness, hops are not overpowering, but the hint of alcohol tells you there is something more sinister going on.  T - The first taste is quite a whollop. That's what you call a solid malt backbone! Hops are quite smooth throughout, and not what I would call overly bitter, especially with such a strong malt presence. I'm also picking up dark berry and raisin flavours blended in with the alcohol, which is noticable but again quite smooth.  M - A touch syrupy, and quite heavy, but the dry resiny finish helps wrap things up.  D - I'm having no problems gulping this baby down, but 2-3 at this pace would certainly catch up to me in a hurry.  I have no idea how old this bottle is, but it certainly did not live up to my expectations in the hop department. It's a very enjoyable beer, but is far more about malt sweetness than hop bitterness.

10099,2093,TheBierBand,4.07,"Got this in Southern Pines, NC while visiting family. I was grocery shopping at Harris Teeter and was pleasantly surprised to find a good selection of good beer at this grocery store. The Dogfish Head 90 Min. IPA is sold in a FOUR PACK... a bit pricey... at $7.99 for a 4 x 12 oz 4 pack.  I poured it into a pint glass and noticed it's deep copper color and the 1"" head that gradually dissipated to a lacy cap.  The aroma was nicely intense. Hints of pine,a nd grapefruit.  The taste was very good. The hops came through immediately giving an immediate warming sensation and the pine/woodsy/citrus flavors command your attention. Some malty background taste to help balance things off. over-all a nice complex taste.  Mouthfeel was good for the style. Good amount of carbonation... not too fizzy. The hoppy taste leave a lingering after taste that is pleasant.  Drinkability is also good.... I had two back to back... and the 9%ABV didn't bother me. Maybe this isn't a beginner's beer, but if you like hops....then go for it.... I would highly recommend Dogfish Head 90 min. IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Monsone,4.12,"Poured from the bottle into an imperial pint glass. Decent 1 to 2 finger white head. Dissipates quickly, leaving a nice lace.  Smells are lots of floral hop and some pine.  Tastes is big oily hop. Pine. Decent sweet malt in the midlle. Finishes with a full hop bitterness.  Meduim bodied mouthfeel with a decent amount of malt.  Pretty drinkable, but this beer is expensive($12 for 4) and strong 9%. That give it a little hit.  Overall a great example of a Imperial/Double IPA. Compares favorably to others I have had, like Dreadnaught.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,illidurit,4.35,"Obtained via trade with Rodenbacher. Poured into a pint glass. Goldenrod body sits under a one finger white head. Head reduces to a moderately large halo and leaves some sitcky resiny lacing on the glass. A quick swirl actually reconstitutes the one finger head.  Piney citrusy hops on the nose, grapefruit, grainy malt  Taste follows the nose, also maybe some apricot, brown sugar. Nice oily hop explosion here, but not overly bitter.  Carbonation is perfect, finish is drying and entices the next sip, and alcohol is well hidden.  Very easy to drink, just beware the 9% abv.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,yemenmocha,4.4,"Pale golden color, clear, generous head.  Nose is somewhat soapy-like with a citrusy clean component.  Palate has an odd sweetness that is quite prominent and then followed by a dryish hop finish. Very atypical to me, as far as my DIPA experiences have been.  Scary how drinkable this ale is.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Gmann,4.07,"Pours a light copper color with an average off-white head. The smell is of oranges and grapefruit, sweet and twangy. A nice mellow grapefruit flavor, some resin and pine hints. No fresh grassy hop flavors. The hops are followed by a creamy caramel type flavor, which mellows out the hops and makes this very drinkable, though a bit on the sweet side. The feel is moderate and creamy, not overly carbonated. I am a bit torn on the drinkability. The first beer drinks way easy but the sweetness will catch up and limited me to maybe 2 in a session.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Erdinger2003,4.33,"I got this beautiful beer in a trade with Reed415  Pours a beautiful head that retains very well. The color is a light gold copper. Lacing is sticky and presents a beautiful looking beer. The smell presents a hop presence that is strong. The taste just bursts with grapefruity hoppiness that's balanced very well. The mouthfeel is a little overcarbonated, just not enough to make the experience any the worse. Overall this seems to be a very good dry hopped Imperial IPA and would be my session beer of choice if I could get it fresh. It's so powerful with great hoppy taste it's just very very good.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Monkeyknife,4.5,Poured from a bottle a clean dark amber color with a creamy head and modest lacing.  Smell of the gods with this one. Malty and sweet with the fruitiness of pineapple and light citrus. Enjoyed the aroma as much as the taste.  Malty and sweet with a lot of depth. Hops are there but more subdued. The alcohol is well hidden. A bit of warm caramel lingers at the end of every drink.  Smooth and very creamy with a nice chewiness to it. Slick feel to the tongue as well. Carbonation is very light.  This beer is so drinkable even with the higher alcohol content. Start me on a Friday night and I'd try to drink straight through to Sunday night.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,SQNfan,4.4,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle with a bottled date of 11/29/2006  A coppered amber in color the beer poured a 1/4"" head that dissipated rather quickly. The nose was filled with citrus hops (grapefruit, orange, pineapple) and balancing caramel malt. In the mouth the beer had great density and a wonderfully rich texture. The huge amount of hops was very well-balanced in the palate with sweet hops though kept enough of a dry bitterness to get you know it was all Double IPA. Even at 9% this is very drinkable. Yum.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,cooncat,4.62,"Serving from a 12 oz. bottle, with a bottled date of 7/06, and reviewed on 5/07, so its had a little time to settle.  The pour produces a huge, rich and creamy tan head over an orangish-amber colored brew. Sheets of lacing form all down the side of the glass all the way to the end.  The nose is HUGE with citric hops (cascade and chinook, I think) and you can spend lots of time just enjoying the heady nose.  The first sip is definitely 'hop heaven'. This is no beer for the timid-tongued! I let a sip wash over the whole of my tongue several times before swallowing. While the predominant flavor is of citric hops (and some floral), there is a malt backbone that that holds up to the hop onslaught (2 row, and plenty of it according to the label). Mouthfeel is medium-full, and its very pleasant on the tongue. At 9% ABV, it's really not a 'session' brew, but rather, one to be savored. While very quaffable, one will satisfy all but the most hardened hop heads.  Bottom line, an Imperial IPA (meaning DIPA) that you can buy with confidence and know that you will enjoy it again, and again. Highly recommended.  Cheers",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,jtslay,4.77,"First of all: ""Mmmm""  Now on to the review...  This beer pours a very clear amber-orange with moderate head that doesn't stick around too long. The aroma is amazing. It is very complex like no other beer I have had before. The taste is equally complex. They managed to balance the hops and the malt for this style of brew that often is overbearing with hops that don't complement the malt. Excellent brew that I highly recommend!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,JoeyBeerBelly,3.55,"Clear orange/amber color with a white head that settles to a thin layer, leaving a good amount of lace.  Smell is citrus hops with some malt aroma.  Taste is kind of sweet upfront, followed by some hop bitterness with alcohol taste/warmth on the finish.  A little too heavy on the malt and alcohol and too light on the hops.  One is enough for me, thanks  I read the reviews and the claim on the cardboard 4 pack carrier of this beer being ""the best ipa in America"" and I expected much more. Give me a Stone Ruination or a Victory Hop Wallop anyday over this over-priced beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,dickieb,4.51,"Poors a nice amber coloe with just a finger of head that barely clings to the glass. Smells quite malty, with less hops then i would expect, but still a realy apealing scent. Taste starts off sweet with some hop flavor, and goes into a lot more hops with some bite, mostly citrusy and bitter twords the end. This is very drinkable for 9%, and quite enjoyable. Im very happy i opted for the 4 pack.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,tempest,3.9,"A good beer, no doubt, but I found it a little underwhelming for a double IPA. There was a big malt profile that reminded me of Southern Tier's Big Red (imperial red) in that is was a rich fruit-like taste, but without much in the way of discernible flavors. Citrus edge to nose. The hops are most of a nice compliment to the malt with a juicy citrus flavor. Worth a try, unless you love double IPAs like Ruination and nothing else.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,BMoney575,4.3,"Sampled on 5-2-07 Bottled on 1-03-07  Pours a very clear amber, with long-lasting thin head.  Smell is surprisingly malty and sweet, with a subtle hop background.  Taste is a lot like the smell, with a strong malty character, and then a huge dose of hop flavor and bitterness. The 9% alcohol is slightly warming and well-masked.  Mouthfeel is good, perfect carbonation and syrupy.  Drinkability is very good, the sweetness and bitterness are extremely well-balanced.  Overall, a very good beer. It would be a regular in my fridge if it didn't cost so much money.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,brewdlyhooked13,4.82,"Appearance - a fine bronze pour into an Ayinger imperial drinking glass, the first time I've used it! I kept the head smallish but it still forms up over a finger's worth of creamy smooth goodness. A steady stream of dotted lace adorns the glass as it empties. And it empties far quicker than it should, but I'm getting ahead of myself...  Aroma - a light pungent and piny nose and grapefruit florals are in charge. Telling as always as to what will unfold.  Taste - sweet and chewy up front, the caramel influence is very nice. Segues seamlessly into a citrusy, snappy, mouth-owning bitterness that makes this one of the best DIPAs in existence. The swallow shows a flash of alcohol and the drying bitterness has a slow-burn effect to it. Lingering dryness and hoppy residuals allow you to enjoy the flavor for some time before taking another sip, but to hell with that...  Mouthfeel - the smoothness of this beer is what really makes it shine, IMO. Texture is a far too under-appreciated component of how we rate all we ingest. The creaminess almost divides the flavors into layers so you can sample them in succession. Should be worth 20% at least for this beer's score as it plays so critically into the whole scheme.  Drinkability - what are the odds that I would bring a growler of this to Dark Lord Day '07 with plans to crack it open Saturday night and then never get the chance? I didn't think the FFF party would end so soon, but it did. I figured there'd be some major after-party set up, but there wasn't. I found my way to a room at the Hampton on the second floor for a spontaneous beer tasting with absolutely no available table space for a friggin 12 ounce bottle, much less a growler. The exhausted owner of said room who put up with us until midnight was a friggin' saint, BTW - who was that guy? *Anyway*, I probably brought too much to share. Two other growlers and and 3 or 4 bombers hit the tables and this was to be my big finale, but circumstances fizzled it. So here I am, typing up the world's longest drinkability segment of the review, drinking this wonderfully delicious brew, planning my revenge for next year - I should bring 3 or 4 growlers of this alone and just push it out all day, that'll teach ya's.

10099,2093,number1bum,4.17,"Part of NEPA BC Split #1.  Pours a semi-clear copper color with 1 finger of off-white head. Not a lot of retention but some sticky lacing to the bottom of the glass. Smell is a nice mix of hops - floral, piney, earthy and woodsy, and just a touch of citrus. There is also a strong sweet malt presence in the nose, and a bit of alcohol.  Taste is wonderfully balanced, starting with a ncie hit of oily hops - all those same flavor characteristics as came through in the nose - but checked through the finish by some subtly sweet, biscuity malts. That alcohol that was present in the smell does not come through in the taste. Oily and creamy mouthfeel from all the hops.  Even at 9% this really isn't a sipper - very drinkable for a DIPA because of the fantastic balance.  Edit: in subsequent tastings I have picked up more alcohol than I prefer and have edited the taste down .5 as a result.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Good head retention and excellent lacing throughout.  S: Mix of grapefruit/citrus and herbal hops in the aroma.  T: A fruity, estery start, leans more on grapefruit and citrus flavors, some malt charactr evident but this one is all about the hops. Ends with the hop bitterness that hangs around for awhile. The hop flavors in this beer are tremendous and complement the ester fruit flavors very well.  M: Light for a DIPA, although slightly on the syrupy side. Not spritzy but well carbonated.  D: felt the alcohol about 2/3 through. This is an incredibly enjoyable drink, I would only last through a few of them.

Aroma: A very grainy malt aroma is the first thing that you notice followed by a bitter hop aroma that average.  Flavor: Malt has a nice a grainy flavor not much sweetness at all. The hop flavor in this beer is not as much as you would think. It is mainly bitter followed by mild sweetness and not much finnishing aroma. I remember a few years back this beer being very sweet and floral.  Mouthfeel: This beer at 9% has some gravity to it and isn't thin or watered down. moderite Co2 levels, and the ballance is still done very well done what I remember it to be.  Overall: The 90 Minute IPA is a very tasty beer . It meets all the standards to be a great IPA altough having tasted the 60 Minute & the 120 Minute I would say the 60 is the best ballanced and all around drinkable beer, the 120 being very tasty/sweet/ & very floral where as the 90 just being avarage.

S - Sweet malty carmel and prominent hops smell, mild ester tones.  T - has a nice well rounded malty flavor with carmel tones. Hops flavor as much as the smell. Could have been hopped up a bit for an IPA. Sweetness is on the backend and bitterness follows.  M - Full and creamy w/ medium carbonation;  D - Would drink no more than 2 in one sitting maybe 3. Worth buying more and aging to see how it does in a year.  Overall, I poured this in a chalice/tulip glass which is worthy for this brew.

10099,2093,PittBeerGirl,4.23,A- Beautiful transparent bronze body with no head at first. As the pour settles a beautiful white head emerges and sticks with it the whole way down.  S- not what I was expecting at first. Smells sweet and malty (not extremely hoppy in the nose).  T- very complex. I have to keep tasting it to see what is in it. Very interesting. Sweet and fruity malt up front with maybe some carmel flavoring. The hops kick in but they are not extreme. They are deeper and lay in the back of the palate..  M- high carbonation and a medium weight body. Goes down suprisingly easy.  D- This is a great DIPA and one of my favorite offerings from DFH.

One finger head, but it wont quit.  Hop aroma is nice, but on par with a regular IPA. I want more hoppy goodness in the nose. Despite that it does smell great. The first taste is big piney hops, much more present than in the nose. Followed by a malt sweetness that wont quit. Man this is a fine DIPA, I could stand for a bit more hops and a little less sweetness. But this is only a minor criticism as this beer does taste excellent.

Smell is sweet and floral with a little bit of pine in there as well. A raisin like sweetness hits the tongue first followed by a very subdued hop bitterness - I'm guessing the 18 months or so of aging has mellowed this brew.

The rich wheat like & malted taste is what jumps out to me. It's like a bowl of cereal it's so rich. The hops are there and are tasty and they do balance out the richness like they are supposed to. Also a little bit sweet but not too much. Also I can taste the alcohol; it tastes a little like liquor.  M- carbonated just right and has a balanced feel. Bitterness doesn't hurt the overall feel.  D- this is where this beer has its problems. I felt like I could only drink one, not just due to the alcohol but due to its richness. Each beer is like a whole meal.

M- This beer was very smooth and creamy, with a nice medium mouthfeel.  D- Good beer, but not my taste on a regular basis.

But after settling in the glass, had the familiar orange look that most IPAs carry. The smell is great. Lots of hops, but not overbearing on the nose. Taste was incredibly smooth for the amount of hops and alcohol. I have heard people say this beer was too sweet, and I thought it was a little overrated the first time i had it on tap at the Stone 10th fest. But after a long day of work and class, a clean palate, and a hunger for a hoppy delight, this hit the spot perfectly.

A nice pale, golden amber, looks similar to a English Pale Ale but with more body. Lots of head as the beer was poured, seemed to last a good amount of time.  Nose is hops! Hops all the way. A wonderful blend of citrus like bitter hops that defenitely have a big time kick.  The taste starts off with the malt sweetness from the two row barely, kind of a green apple flavor from the start. Hop flavor quickly comes through with an awesome punch of citrus notes. Bitterness hits at just the right amount to round everything out. As the beer warms a little, more malt flavors come through that help balance things out even better. The malt is never really that sweet, but has a lot of hints of sweeter flavors that blend very well w/this brew. Mouthfeel is nearly perfect for the style. Alcohol flavor is very well masked for the high ABV, as it just makes its way through for a little additional flavor.  I never knew a beer could be 9%ABV and be this drinkable. This brew is dangerously drinkable and delicious! Perfectly balanced, which I highly respect, as Dogfish head seems to realize a lot of flavor is a good thing, but blance is key in a good beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,therica,3.73,"Over-the top IPA. Much like biting into the skin of a fresh grapefruit. Pucker up.  Still, once the beer settled, I was better able to enjoy it. Most enjoyable was slipping it on my wife for her obligatory ""taste,"" and watching her mouth turn nearly inside out!  A- nice, darker caramely honey-color, decent head which stays and lingers on the sides of the glass.  S- either inviting and intriguing, or a put-off depending on your own personal preferences. Reminded me a bit of a noseful of Airwick.  T- grapefruit grapefruit and hops hops hops. The alcohol content was not very apparent to me in the taste. Nice sweetness hidden in the aftertaste, and more complex flavors after the gulp, as well.  M- (see pucker, above)  D- probably too over-the-top for my tastes as a regular or multi-bottle choice, but definitely worth the try.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I expected to be overwhelmed however there is a great balance between the kick of hop flavor and the bitter taste. There is also some sweetness that shows through. Many layers of taste that meld well together M: This drink stays on your tounge a bit, texture wise reminds me of a slightly more viscous drink. Very nice in the mouth very smooth.  D: at 9% you couldnt or maybe shouldnt drink a bunch in a row, that said you might be able to just on taste alone. Many people say they pick up the alcohol alot, my other drink is scotch neat, so i may be slightly under appreciative of this aspect.

10099,2093,ncvbc,4.15,"It's a beautiful deep orange with reddish hues. Nice amounts of carbonation and a good, sturdy head that didn't seem to go away. I'm sure the smell was improved slightly as well as the floral aromas and hops were presented appropriately. Again, I could taste the alcohol nearly as well as everything else offered in this brew. Good use of some sweet citrus and floral flavors make this one chewy. Huge hops as well. The mouthfeel is nice and balanced and the bite goes away from the alcohol that I could taste initially. I could probably drink a couple of these max but even still this beer was better after another tasting. I'd love to find this on-tap, hopefully soon. I'm sure that would bring the taste up a mark. A darn good DIPA. This and the Seeing Double from Foothills have both been recent favorites in this style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Aroma is very strong with pine and citrus hops and sweet bread and alcohol. Taste is sugary sweet malts with pine and citrus hops. Not as hoppy as you would expect.

Taste is of nice citrus (grapefruit to be exact) and pine hops. This is followed by a nice bit of maltiness that is quickly replaced by a pleasant hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is a bit oily and is medium to full bodied. Drinkability is good as this beer hides its alcohol quite well with an excellent hop profile that, while bold, isn't as overpowering as expected.

Smell: Hops - piney and floral with hint of fruitiness. Malt - sugary bread and alcohol.  Taste: Right out of the gate we get a nice hop taste. Very similar to the smell with piney, floral and fruit aspects. Then comes the malt which trys to balance out this beer and does a decent job. Noticeable alcohol that is not in your face but adds a warm touch to the taste. Enjoyable to say the least...  Mouthfeel: Very Smooth. Chewy mouthfeel.

10099,2093,AleYes,4.24,"Have been enjoying this beer for a few months now. Definitely at the top of my current favorites list. Where I buy it, it is about $10 for a 4-pack, not cheap, but worth the cost for the quality.  Forms a nice head in the glass. The beer is a bit cloudy, with a golden, orange, coppery color. Wonderful aromas, full, very complex, slightly fruity, citrusy, in the nose and taste. Has a slight malt sweet taste with a touch of yeast. I think the apparent sweetness comes partly from the fruitiness (like a fruity wine will seem sweeter than it actually is), but has a definite nice Hop bite to more than counter the sweet note.  Drank best cool, not cold, like you would Bass Ale or Guinness.  Unlike other high abv beers I've tried, the alcohol taste does not hit you hard, it is ameliorated by complexity of all the other flavors. Although, at 9% ABV, not one that you want to drink too many of in one sitting.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,quasimoto,3.53,This beer pours a nice orangish color with a nice big fluffy white head. Looks good with its clear color and constant carbonation bubbles. The aromas are of sweet grapefruit and strong floral aromas. Maybe some diacytl. There also seems to be a bit of a paper flavor and lots of alcohol as it warms. The flavor balances it out rather nicely. The malt flavor comes through with a caramel hint and and a sort of pineapple alcohol blend. The mouth feel starts with some sharp carbonation but warms up in your mouth. Turns silky smooth. but then dries out in the end. Leaves a cloying residue in your mouth though. rather odd. All together it is one heck of a beer.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Graebner,4.47,"Pours an amber-orange-red color. Unlike any PA ive seen. About a finger+ of fine and dense off-white head. Lots of bubble columns, and they look like they're moving through a VERY viscous liquid.  Nose is intense! Sweet cake and rosewater is noticable from a distance, but when you get down into it there's, pine, herbal and medicinal hops, esters. I'm not fully doing it justice; it's incredibly complex and layered.  WHOA! Holy crap! This thing follows up on its nose by shanking your tastebuds with a pterodactyl cockbone of flavor. Smooth as hell, creamy and chewy in your mouth. Almost fools you into thinking it will be sweet up front, but it quickly dispenses with that and throws hops all over. Oily pine, herbal, some floral and citrus-tart hops scour your mouth of all moisture. Nevertheless, it finishes surprisingly cleanly and quite dryly.  Mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth, the CO2 is spot on, and the alcohol is not overpowering and serves to lend more body and smoothness to the brew. Though it is quite dry, it is by no means unpleasant.  Not something you'd want alot of, as 9% abv will make for an interesting time quite promptly. That said, short of the local statutes and/or your personal feelings on drunkenness, theres nothing to keep you from downing quite a few of these. Sits well on the stomach, tastes fantastic on the palate. What more can one ask for?",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The hops are there, but they just aren't as powerful as they should be for the style.

Full bodied with much more malt sweetness than I expected. Not nearly as hoppy as I would have expected. Encounterd a slight vegetal flavor. Long dry finish.  I would have to say I was disappointed with this. Not sure if I had a bunk bottle, but this really wasn't what I expected.

10099,2093,kpantz,4.08,"Executive Summary: So I've decided to return to my roots. This is one of the first craft beers (certainly the first DIPA) I ever drank. Several years later, I now return to my birthing grounds to see how I - and the 90 Minute - have changed. Is the DIPA still truly my favorite style? If I believe my reviews, the answer may just lie in the bottle that sits before me, warming ever so slowly towards drinking temperature.  Appearance: Just as smokin' hot as I remember it. Feels like one of those old girlfriends that just never seems to stop being way too pretty. Finger thick off-white head (reducing to a film) on a beautiful, crystal clear amber body. Lacing? Gratuituous.  Smell: Hops, hops and more hops. Grassy/piney notes dominate, with a smattering of citrus. Little if any sweetness or malt in the nose. I think the aroma, however, could have been a little more inviting this time around. As of 2007, there are better smelling DIPAs out there.  Taste: Some malty goodness to start, but it's short-lived. Hops quickly take over the palate and transition nicely to a lingering bitterness, with some of the sweetness making a resurgence on the backside. A very clean, crisp hop flavor here. I'm not sure what the current BOM is, but I'm detecting Amarillo and perhaps Warrior (not sure about the Simcoe this time around). As the beer warms, the sweetness becomes more apparent, as does the alcohol. In a good way, of course.  Mouthfeel: Like my review of a couple years ago, it's like candy. Sticky sweet, but not cloying. This is not a chugging beer, and it's meant to be savored in all corners of the mouth. I highly recommend the back-left corner, FWIW.  Drinkability: This is a whopper of a brew disguised as a session beer. It's very well balanced, so you're not feeling overwhelmed on the palate, nor does it seem to fill out the corners of your stomach like some other Double IPAs (I'm thinking of Weyerbacher's Double Simcoe and FFF Dreadnaught here). Drink. Savor. Rinse. Repeat. Do so with caution.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,kdoc8,4.6,"If Three Floyd's Dreadnaught was the IPA that popped my IPA-cherry, then Dogfish Head 90 minute was the one that got away...and one I'll never forget. Except it didn't get away. Ok - forget that analogy. It's a fabulous IPA and I won't besmirch it anymore with my rambling about it. I'm not typically an IPA fan, but I love this beer. It pours out with a reddish-brownish-golden color, a nice foamy bubbling head. It smells just so complex - fruits and flowers and bitter hops and sweet hops, all rolled into one. The taste is just as complex as the smell - it starts out with the taste of hops but then complexes and you get the other tones as you swallow slowly and let it savor. The aftertaste isn't bitter or pungent or anything that you can find with IPAs. Fabulous. I'd be hard pressed to choose between this and 3F Dreadnaught - they are both exceptional IPAs.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Smell is very floral hops. It's not smack you in the face hops smell, but it's hops and all hops. Taste is very well balanced. The hops are very well complimented by a good amount of malt. They all blend and work well together. There's no bitter, astringent hops here. Mouthfeel is very smooth and non-cloying. The label states that this beer is 9% but it's nowhere to be found.

It's a much thicker aroma than expected for the style.  T: It's the malt that hits me first. The sweetness and level of alcohol come forth in a brief explosion of flavor before the hops kick in and settle things.  M: It has a heavy, almost syrupy, presence in the mouth thanks to an adundance of hops for a DIPA. It just seems to make the flavors that much more pronounced.

Clearly the hops are what's important to this beer but the overall flavor was balanced and not overly bitter. The bottle is labeled as being bottled almost 6 months ago so perhaps the beer has significantly mellowed out (but for me the mellow version tastes delicious!)  A- Poured a beautiful amber bronze color, but with almost no head, and no head retention. Some lacing but nothing impressive.  S- A whiff brings in fruity hops flavors: apricots, strawberries, oranges. A touch of the herbal side.  T- More fruit- with just a touch of sweetness and acidity. Now some maltiness showing itself.

The smell has nice grapefruit aroma with some spicy notes and a bit of sweet malt.  The taste on first sip is very citrusy(grapefruit & lemon) giving it good hop bitterness but it's balanced by a strong backbone of caramel malt and boy, does that work for this DIPA. Further sips in and the malt actually becomes the dominant feature of this brew and the warming from the alcohol also starts to play a part. Ahhh...this is great stuff. I'm so pleased Colorado is a distribtion point for Dogfish Head beers.  More sips in and it's like a seesaw ride. First the malt is dominant, then the hops are. I have to say, for a 9%abv brew, this one's drinkability factor is outstanding!  I'm just finishing what's left in my glass and I couldn't have enjoyed *any* DIPA more. So much taste and yet, so damn smooth and easy drinking. World class brew imho.  Bottom line: A nectar of the gods!

You do get the scent of the stong alcohol content in the beer.  T - Hoptastic, there's a party on your tongue and everyone is invited!!! Lingers for a while after you swallow.

However, the quality level of East Coast beers overall has clearly improved since last I lived here, and I can no longer say that.  I hadn't tried the 90 minute in a couple of years (you can find it out west, even on tap occasionally, but it's hardly plentiful), so wanted to try it again before reviewing it.  The beer is a very lovely light orange color, with good foam head and lacing in the glass. However, the beer did not come across to me as the hop monster I seem to recall. Granted, my taste in beers has probably undergone something of a transformation after a couple years in the NW, but still... this beer tasted considerably lighter then I remember.  That being said, this is a very nice beer, with a considerable hop presence. I get a good amount of citrus on the palate, mostly orange flavor I think. I don't know quite what it is, and I'll gladly concede this is probably just a matter of taste, but there's always something in the malt finish that I just don't quite like about this beer. For me it makes it difficult to drink very much (probably a good thing), and is something that I find becomes increasingly noticeable as I go along.

Nose was of dry grain, adequate hops and lots of alcohol. I was surprised at how much alcohol I smelled in this brew especially after opening it fresh out of the fridge. After warming the alcohol became even more apparent.  Mouthfeel was huge. Malt dominated at first with a light and crisp grain, almost oak-ish in taste giving way to a cherry finish. Much more of a sweet malt presence than a dry one.  Hops kick in immediately with a great amount of bitterness, grapefruit flavor and peppery finish but it still manages to go down smoothly, a nice aspect of balance.

An inch of medium white head recedes to a nice lace that travels down the glass with me. The aroma is of clove, figs and raisins. The taste is of initial clove and hop, followed by the raisin, caramel and clove. I like the citrusy finish. Mouthfeel is wonderful, just what an IPA of this strength should be.

Strong, but not overwhelming. Wonderful finish.  Lots of carbonation, but not overpowering in the mouth.  I had been looking forward to trying this for quite some time and finally found it in my area and I'm so glad I did. I would gladly have more of this, though the price of a four pack was just a bit high.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The color is lustrous and glows like burnished brass.  Scent is a lovely hoppy grapefruit and pine which breaks free as soon the bottle is opened.  Grapefruit, sweetness, yeasty bread, peppery spice and resinous pine flavors. This beer is sticky sweet.  Thick, viscous almost syrupy mouthfeel (I'm licking my lips), definite boozy alcohol warming culminating in an astringent finish.  Bold and delicious; I really like this.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S  Piney and citrus hops but pleasant not offensively strong. Very nice aroma.  T  Grapefruit and strong hop bitterness dominate the front end. Finished sweet and boozy. A hophead dream.  M/D  A little sticky because of the intense flavor, finish is not that smooth and crisp but I am nitpicking.

Loads of sticky lacing is left about the glass just above a sizeable collar of foam, the only remants of the once substantial head.  A showy aromatic nose brims with sweet stone fruits loads and piney citrus hops. Alcohol soaked apricot and simple bready malts linger in the background allowing the stone fruit and hops to take center stage.  One of the sweeter DIPAs, this boasts pungeant citrus zest and bitter hop flavors upfront that slowly give away to abundant orange stone fruit on a boozy but neat finish and short lived aftertaste.  Bitter hops fallout in the mid palate leaving the sweet stone fruit the tough job of filling their shoes, it feels like the rug is pulled out from under this beer without any malts to serve as a safety net. Flavor falls short and the mouthfeel quickly goes from a chewy thick feeling to a vapid and thin presence on the hollow mid palate and finish.  Boozy alcohol, a lackluster mouthfeel, cloying sweetness and a massively dry finish make this one tough going down. This would be much more enjoyable if it had more body, persitent hop bitters and a good malt backbone.  Overall, this is nice upfront yet it leaves a lot to be desired in body and mouthfeel beyond the initial tase.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The appearance is a nice, clear amber/orange color with about an inch of foam at the top. The smell is nice, very aromatic hops and citrusy blend, just what you'd expect from an IPA. The taste is brilliant; perfect hop bombardment with just the right amount of balancing crisp citrus flavor to finish with. Mouthfeel is very good and drinkability is even better. It's definitely a great beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

A - clear amber body, that seams to glow around the edges like polished bronze, sits under a paper-white, 2-fingered head, sinking to filmy nothingness relatively quickly.  S - from the crack of the bottle, throughout the pour, and during the drinking, this beer fills the room with sweet citrus that seems slightly one dimensional (pineapple with sugar), very faint pine drifts in now and then, but mostly, this is all citrus.  T - very, very sweet, sticky, and citric. slight malt breadiness in the finish (like french-bread out of the toaster), but, again, this is overwhelmingly hoppy.  M - smooth, medium to big bodied with low to medium carbonation and a very odd effect: my tongue is completely dry, but i feel like my cheeks and throat are soaking wet. kinda cool, actually.  D - this beer gets a lot better as it warms, become less sweet and more complex. but, just like its big brother, the 120 minute, i find this to be far too sugary. is it bitter? sure, but i can't taste that sort of bitterness anymore. overall, a good beer that looses points to its extreme flavors. i guess if i want more ballanced, less ""experimental"" IPAs, i shouldn't drink DFH.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

RERATE: OK, so it would appear my last bottle was a bit lightstruck. This one (a member of the same 4-pack) has a rich floral and citrus hop aroma with a slight background of malt.

Served in the Dogfish Head glass, I assume is specifically for this beer. Looked a light orange and thick head that went away quickly. Smelled of citrus rind and pine oil, just enough sweetness to let you know it's still there. First sip, notice grapefruit rind and some piney hops and, again, enough malt to remind you that this is just not hop nectar. The bitter rind seemed to subside some as the beer had a chance to breathe, or maybe I just got used to it. Light mouthfeel and carbonation. The bitterness didn't linger too long after each sip, just begging you to take another. Very drinkable, but maybe not more than one or two. Don't think I or my taste buds could take a whole sixer. If the 90 min. is this good I can't wait for others to start trickling in, so, hopefully, this will be the first in a long line of Dogfish Head coming the Georgia way.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Taste is fuit blend, really seems to be tropical like in nature. PIney hops are there too, along with the alcohol. Full yet dry mouthfeel.

A deliciously light citrusy syrup-like sweetness to offset the hops. I think I smell/taste a hint of banana. I'm trying to think of what this could use..maybe a little bit more carbonation?

Taste: Very balanced with slight hop bitterness growing and fighting with the sweetness all the way through, spices blending with alcohol, slightly buttery, muted tealike hops, two layered finish with dry bitterness and wet sweetness sitting side by side.

Smell: Hops are dominant in the smell. There are some citrus undertones and the smell of alcohol is present.  Taste: Again, hops dominate. Very tasty beer, but the hops definitely provide a bitter bite which dominates in this brew. Alcohol can definitely be picked up as well. On the outskirts are some floral and citrus flavors, but pine prevails. For what it's worth, it is very sugary and sweet. Perhaps too sweet.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Something about this beer seems to have a bite to it. It's a very good beer and I could drink a few. But, I think there's two or three DIPAs out there that I'd rather have. Yulesmith, Dreadnaught, and Ruination to point them out. Overall, very good, but I've had better in this class.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

A - The head & lacing stay around for a while and it's very frothy. The color is like that of a White Zinfandel wine, but a little bit more brown to it. S - I wish I could get a better smell of it, but I have allergies at the moment. From what I can get, it's a fruity and hoppy smell, which is typical. T - The taste is truly incredible. A nice sweetness, with hops, fruit, and light malt. I can't say much, just that it's great. I want to give it a 5, but I know there's room for improvement and it was disappointing when I had it on tap. M - The mouthfeel is great too. It's creamy and smooth all the way through.

One year later this beer still has that hop bite. Lot's of herbal and floral tasting hops. Hints of pine and citrus are intertwined as well. One year old this is still a hop bomb.

Taste: Alcohol sweetness and warmth, sweet malt, maple like sweetness, then a huge does of floral hops in the nose, roasted coffee beans and breadiness in the finish cleans it up.  Mouthfeel: Nice smooth and creamy, medium carbonation, full bodied, too heavy for a session beer in my opinion, and rightly so.

On the nose, there is a pronounced floral hop aroma, with a slight hint of malt on the back end, but not overly intense. Present, there are aromas of pine, grass, and fruit.  On the palate, the beer starts off slightly sweet, but is followed by an incredibly dry hop flavor. There are hints of honey, ctrus and pine. It finishes dry, but pleasant. The flavor lasts for seconds.  This is a good, full-bodied IPA. It expresses incredible viscosity that coats the entire mouth and retains the flavor for long after each sip.  At 9% ABV, this brew expresses almost flawless balance between malt and hops.

Not sure if my 2 cents are worth very much at this point for Dogfish Head's 90 Min IPA, but such is the spirit of beer karma...  Appears light golden in color, very whitish-tan head that quickly dissipates and leaves almost no lacing. A bit too clear for me, but what lurks in this transparent ale is pure IPA goodness. The aroma is a blend of sweet pear, sour apple mash and whiskey-esque hops, overall a very pleasing boquet. Bubbly citrus and flowery notes as well.  The taste is difficult to nail down...all I can say for sure is that this beer is fucking tasty. Some citrus, plenty o' hops, and barley. Mouthfeel is juicy and crisp, with a great hoppy bite on the end. Definately refreshing, could use a minor adjustment of the carbonation level though...keyword is minor.

10099,2093,Hornet2003,4.12,"Appearance: Copper coloured. A little darker than your average IPA. Small half-finger head on the pour.  Smell: I took a whiff from the bottle and Holy Wow. So much hops it's almost comical. There is a slightly candy-ish sweet aroma coming through.  Taste: I've never had an IPA(Imperial or otherwise) that is this sweet, initially. It is a pleasant sweet, however and as I think about it, not overpowering. Obviously DFH tried to somehow counteract the hoppy bitterness with a gigantic mal backbone. The sweetness turns into a sort of salty aftertaste. I can definately taste the booziness(9%) when I roll it over my tongue.  Mouthfeel: Moderate carbonation. Thick and oily mouthfeel leaves a residual hop coating on your tongue.  Drinkability: I don't think I could handle more than one in a night. Very sweet and thick. The ABV is high too so I don't think it would be wise to polish off a 4-pack of these.  Overall: This is quite the experience. I'm a CDN so these beers don't make it up to the Great White North unless we bring em back ourselves. I can't say I've ever had anything like this.

Nothing impressive in the head retention department. Seemed to smell the malt first before the hops, which surprised me. Also detected a bit of a citrus smell. Very well balanced for a double. At first I thought it was a little malty, but with additional sips I alternated between hoppy and malty and back to hoppy, so for me that's a good sign of a balanced beer. A little piney on the back of the tongue, but that's what I expect in an IPA. Medium/full body.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,cheers2beers,4.3,"This review will be based on a fresh 90minute(2007) vs. a 1year aged 90 minute(2006). Served from 12oz bottles to pint glasses side by side. This review will be scored on the fresh vintage and the aged is there for pleasure.  2007 Appearance: This beer pours a very clean and clear hue of copper and amber. A pure white head stood up roughly a finger and a half high, then settled to just a white ring around my glass with a few islands. Many columns of beading can be found within.  2006 Appearance: Wow! This one poured very cloudy. Murky shades of burnt orange and the head remained a bright white with the same settlement as the fresh. I can barely see the beading inside,but it does still remain within.  2007 Smell: The aroma starts off with a spicy peppery hop.Citrusy orange in the middle and a smooth lightly caramel malt aroma.  2006 Smell: Mmmm. Smells more sweet and citrusy than the fresh. More fruity esters come out and even a hint of Belgian ale breadiness comes through. This has become much more malty in the nose.  2007 Taste: A clean taste of grassy and citrus hop bursts in my mouth followed by a very expressive amount of alcohol. This one has slight bitterness throughout, but not bad by any means. Sticky sweet malts are noted, but balanced very well with the hops.  2006 Taste: Whoa! This has drastically changed.This one starts off with sweet orange, spicy(peppery) on the tongue, and very delightful peanut brittle towards the finish. This has become a malt bomb. The hops are still there but has become noticably less aggressive. The alcohol seems to remain the same intencity,but masked a little better.  2007 Mouthfeel: Thinner side of medium bodied with a high amount of carbonation. Sticky, bitter, and a bunch of alcohol that drys out the palate.  2006 Mouthfeel: Thicker side of medium bodied with slightly less carbonation than the fresh. Sticky, malty, much less bitter and the alcohol is not as drying. Perhaps the hops is the drying factor on the palate?  2006-2007 Drinkability: This beer has always been a pleasure to drink. Basically, fresh equals more citrus and a hop bitterness versus the aged, still citusy, but less profound and more malty rather than hoppy. Both are extremely wonderful and easy to drink. I would like to try this with other great beers from Dogfish Head. Two thumbs up all the way and as always...    Cheers2Beers",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Orange body and full carbonation.  First pull and my thoughts are that this is as oily as any beer I've consumed. Hop resin is paramount. Syrupy and candied at times but in the end the hops are the theme. More balanced than the majority of its west coast cousins. Alcohol comes through more in the smell than the gobbling.  Notes: I ended up liking this. The sweetness and candied presence is a turn off but the beer is balanced and the quality is evident. More or less its just not for me.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,Absumaster,3.62,"Got this in a trade with dogfooddog, thanks again! I have the #1000 review.  Appearance is an orange brown color with very little head and a slight viscoeus pour.  Smell is sweet and full, very malty with marmelade scents. A slight smokey and hoppy smell, but not as hoppy as I expected.  Taste is bitter and sweet, with a big maltiness. There is a good amount of hop in this beer, but not as much as I expected. The big body of this beer seems to balance it very good. Alcohol was also nicely hidden, but did give a warming sensation. Body is sweet and sticky, which is a bit too much for me, I like it more dry.  I am not sure what to think of this, the bottle traveled half the world, so this might have altered it's properties, I don't know, but I am not convinced of the superiority of this beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,adammills,4.57,"This beer is outrageous! It pours a solid gold in color with a moderate head. I am NOT a hop head and was a bit wary of this brew for that reason. However, the hop aroma is round and full, very floral and a bit citrus. The brew is sweet and finely balanced, the sweetness to this beer is almost fruity. The fact that it is nine percent is the only drawback because I could pound this beer over and over. It is a knockout!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,cabsandking,4.59,"Pours a dark copper with an off white lace ring and some sticky lace pools. Huge fruit aromas... bright tropical fruits, dried pineapple, apples, taffy, and raisons. Nice complexities in the taste with notes of caramel, dried fruits, apple cider, pear, and plum. Big hop flavors that are mostly bitter and black pepper characters. Much of the hops carry over into the finish and is accompanied by some acidic notes. Full body and a viscous mouthfeel that coats nicely and cloys slightly. This is really good stuff my friends, you must try!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,vwcraig,4.35,"Beautiful amber color and bright white head that gives way to spots of head on top of beer. Slow-rising bubbles, but carbonation is there. Fresh citrusy hop smell and what seems to me to be a crystal malt smell. Wasn't expecting as sweet of a taste out of this as what I got. Kind of wanted more of a hoppy bitterness but was very impressed with the overall taste. Mouthfeel was also different as it wasn't drying at all but seemed to wet my mouth like water without being watery. Very surprising and impressive. Drinkability for me is excellent as well and consider myself lucky to be living in the land of DFH distribution.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Georgiabeer,4.8,"Pours a perfectly clear dark honey color with a fine bubbled short head that is white to offwhite. The smell is a very nice hop/malt combo. There is a piney/grapefruity hop smell that is slightly subsumed by the malt. The taste is malty and grainy up front with a honeyish aftertaste and malt underlying it all. Some roastiness in the background, and a warm and brandyish finish. Complex- bounces back and forth between malt, alcohol and hops. Utterly delicious, a masterpiece of flavor. The mouthfeel is smooth and slightly viscous. Low carbonation on draft is very nice for developing flavors. Really amazing drinkability, very smooth and easy to drink with a great palate that holds your interest. Top notch.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Donthoseme,4.37,I got this in a four pack in maine. A 10$ four pack left me with big expectations. I was not let down.  A - It pours a golden color much lighter than expected in a DIPA. very clear with a small head.  S - You can definatley smell a grapes/grapegruit/sweet maltiness. It's strong but not overbearing.  T- The taste is sweet and well balanced with not too much hoppiness. In fact it's not as hoppy as i would have expected it to taste. But the row 2 barley gives it a rich malty character.  M - It's a very full bodied. It's much thicker and fuller than i expected from just looking at it. It's almost creamy and not too carbonated.  D - It's very thick and full of alcohol. I couldn't drink a bunch in one sitting just because how filling and how much alcohol. It's almost too much taste to drink a lot of.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,kwakwhore,4.4,"Pour with an ample off white head which leaves some lace on the glass.Scents include a mix of malt sugar and grapefruit. The flavor is a perfect balance of hoppy bitterness and malty sweetness. 9%alcohol is not evident in the flavor but it will hit you pretty hard which is why drinkability is a bit lower. This is my favorite beer, one which never disappoints me. It is the best DIPA I've tasted.(Upon further reflection, Pliny and Hopslam, I find my score for this beer to be a bit too high, but it's still pretty damn good). Drink this beer fresh to get a good shot of hops, don't let it age for any length of time.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,ZimZamZoom,3.88,"12 oz. bottle poured into a goblet. Bottled on 02/01/2006. Consumed in the waning hours of 12/31/06.  Poured a nice copper color with a white head that disappeared fast. Lacing is minimal.  Smell is sweet and malty, with citrusy hops and alcohol. Taste is a whirlwind of these flavors with the alcohol winning out in the end. Starts malty with alcohol mixed in, then you get blasted with the hops with alcohol mixed in, and finally you get the alcohol with alcohol mixed in. Wow.  This DIPA is thick and assaulting on the mouth. The texture may be smooth behind the carbonation and alcohol but you never really get to find out.  Drinking one of these is a good idea. I'll be letting the rest of this four pack sit for a while to see what some age does for it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Citrus hops up front backed by a solid and rich malt backbone... not too sweet and not too bitter. This is the perfect drinker.  Mouthfeel is light and creamy with little carbonation. The lack of carbonation does not make this beer syrupy.

I've had this in bottles and on tap, and on tap is most definately better! It's not too bitter, and not too hoppy.  All around this is an exceptional IPA, definately my personal favorite for Craft Brews.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,pavandal,4.08,"Beer poured a soft golden color into my pint. a small creamy head, little lacing as I drank.  The strongest smells I caught were grapefruit and butterscotch. A very inviting smell, I must say.  Taste was awesome. The butterscotch smell carried through into the taste, as this was what I matched the malt backbone to. The hops were perfectly done as well, strong but not out of control. A spicy, sweet brew. Lovely!  This is a great DIPA, I can definately see myself picking up a case if I can find it around here. High ABV, so don't session this like you do an IPA, but enjoy it while you're grilling or something and you'll be one happy Beer Advocate.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,stevecee2003,4.45,"APP - Light amber color, with a small haze drifting throughout. Nice creamy head, that looks like cotton floating on top.  SMELL - fruits, spices, some malt and a little pine.  TASTE - Ahh this is where the value comes through! It has the unmistakable hoppy taste, but it's not quite so sharp as say a Titan IPA. It's in the style of a double-IPA, like the Hercules, but again not as sharp as that one as well. There's also cheddar, roasted malts, and it finishes with a hint of the yeast. Very very nice combination.  MOUTH - Surprisingly smooth. More than I would have thought for a ""90 minute"". It is my first experience with anything like a 90-minute, but I am told it is similar to the double IPA. Yet this doesn't feel the same. Much smoother.  DRINKABILITY - One or two of these babies should do you. With an ABV of 9% you must be careful. But as the highlight of an evening, it's great.  NOTES: An excellent beer! It's the smoothness that won me over. You know going in about the strength, and you come out on the other end surprised with it's smoothness. It's like you have just been seduced. And that is wonderful. Highly recommended.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,ojiikun,4.08,"I am really excited about this one. The DFH 60 minute IPA redefined what a hoppy beer could be for me. Though I generally like strong IPAs better, I am hoping this one in particular will be a new genre favourite.  Poured from a 12oz bottle into a standard french style beer glass. Pours a clear light brown with possibly the tiniest bit of chill haze. The smell of hops is actually overwhelming the moment the cap hisses off!  Little head of which to speak, but possibly due to careful pouring. Maybe half an inch that quickly faded to a thin glaze. The lace, however, was nearly solid white from rim to the bottom of the empty glass. Impressive.  Smell is obviously that of hops, but not the expected cold, medicinal smell. Rather something warm and woody like an herbed liquor. Also suprisingly malty with chocolate undertones. Almost too many smells to comprehend. Without hyperbole, I can say this smells like a good cologne.  Taste is somewhat more simple. Loads of hops, minty and tart. Not at all peppery or bitter. Oak leaves and peat come close. A sweet, candilike delivery of the hops isn't necessarily smooth, but doesn't at all try to hide the character of the buds. Grapefruit tartness eeks out as the beer opens up.  Mouthfeel is like sweet, chewy pastry. Although alcohol is easy to smell, you don't really taste it over all those hops. As drinkable as any hiPA I've had.  All in all a great great brew, but in my opinion not any better than or worth the price hike of the DFH 60 minute IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,BeerMang,4.03,"Appearance is a light amber color with a nice head when poured dissapateing quickly.  Smell is very powerfull with the hops being the most present. A pine smell is also present.  Taste of hops is very strong and is great if you are need of a hop fix. A pine flavor is noticable. Bittersweet with citric afternotes  Mouthfeel is oily but nice. The 9% Abv is not to much, I think it is great for such a hopy beer. The hops lingers in you mouth for a while after takeing a sip.  Drinkability is good, personaly I think it is a great beer but would only like one or two. Just enough to get my hop fix.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,gun1now,4.43,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass. The head is nice and produces a wonderful hoppy aroma. Head quickly disappears which is why drinking this from a tulip glass is recommended since I got 3 full tulips from my 12 oz bottle and a nice head reappears with every pour.  Full of malty taste and balanced well with plenty of hops, as you would expect. Tastes very similar to the 120-minute IPA. Perhaps a little toned down but not as much as you would expect since the alcohol content is 12% less.  Very enjoyable to drink but because of the amount of taste, hops, and alcohol in this beer 1 is usually the limit.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,BBM,4.22,"Pours a cloudy burnt amber in a tulip glass, with a one-finger white head, and sweet, sticky lacing. The smell is an array of citrus, fruits, pine and bread.  Well, as the name suggests, this DIPA is very well hopped, with notes of pine, citrus, fruits, and grass. There is a not-so-subtle malt backbone as well, to give it a biscuity quality. The finish is big bitter hops on the palate that really hammers the tastebuds (in a good way).  The mouthfeel is full and chewy, and this beer is a bit heavy, so drinkability is somewhat limited. Still a first class DIPA all the way.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,masterkush,4.23,"Poured a beautiful golden amber into my glass, from a 2006 bottle. A finger thick head and nice lacing throughout.  Up front smells of malt are overwhelming, I can barely smell the hops, but I know they are there.  First off the taste is unsurprisingly malts, it hits strong with a toffee like overtone, quite tasty and then more of the same. They aren't joking when they say a ridiculous amount of English Two-row barley... It finishes off with a bit of a hop bite, but not overwhelming with the barley still in full control The aftertase however is the lingering hops...Once the malt finally subsides you can really taste the hops coming through. It lingers for quite some time.  Mouthfeel is slightly thick, but nicely carbonated to balance it out. This is quite a nice beer, balanced, maybe a bit over balanced on the malt side for my taste.  If you are looking for a pure and simple hop fix, i'd go with the 60 minute ipa.  A great beer, and definitely should try this if you never had. It's not overly complex and quite a nice sipping beer and a nice winter warmer with its high and well hidden abv.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I notice a bit of alcohol on the nose as well. But the aromas are a bit weak.  The flavor on this beer is very good. What a well done brew. There is a lot of balance in this one. It is very creamy and sweet up front, but then finishes with bitterness from the hops that really lingers in your mouth.  Really big round full mouthfeel.  This one comes across as pretty drinkable, especially considering how much alcohol is in this beer. I have had this on draft once and liked it quite a bit, and the bottled version didn't disappoint either.

10099,2093,drseamus,4.08,"Beer was served from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: The color was a slightly reddish amber with almost no head at all.  Aroma: There is a moderate hop aroma with a very slight citrus hint.  Taste: For a beer with 90 IBUs, it is surprisingly smooth. There is the initial bite from the hops, but that quickly fades do a more subdued flavor. It does leave an aftertaste from the hops, but it isn't heavy.  Mouthfeel: Light to moderate carbonation, but it tastes heavier than it looks. No doubt the ""ridiculous amount of English Two-row Barley"" has something to do with that.  Drinkibility: This is a great beer and I'm not a fan of double IPA's in general. I have and would again drink multiples of these. It is 9% ABV though, so don't go overboard.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,RidiculedDisplay,4.27,"Thought I'd review the last bottle of the four-pack I picked up from Lone Hill Liquors in Glendora. Poured into an oversized wine glass.  Appearance: Pours with a whisp of a head fading into a rather familiar DIPA ""disturbed ocean water"" thin haze over the body of the brew. Lacing is sporatic and consists of dots which cling to the glass. Pretty attractive head, overall, but nothing stand-out from the style. Color is an apple cider amber. Quite pretty, but I think it could be a little darker. Perhaps just personal preference, however.  Smell: Grapefruit, pine, and orange zest-like hop aromas hit first. Followed by pineapple, blueberry malt aromas, and a hint of butterscotch and almost nutty back accents. The malty aromas that blend so seamlessly with the hop aromas in this one reminds me quite a bit of Stone's 10th Anniversary DIPA, which is a favorite of mine. Unlike that brew, this one seems a little more toned down in aroma intensity. Still, without trying this beer, I would have never realized one could make the argument that Stone's 10th is basically 90-minute IPA's big sister or something. Am I crazy in thinking this? Maybe. Overall, an incredibly hoppy but also malty aroma. The two, perhaps, don't blend as well as they could, but I enjoy the upped malty estery quality of some DIPAs out there, and this is one of the more sweet, malty varieties I've tried, while still remaining quite the hop bomb.  Taste: A little alcohol upon sipping. Pine, citrus, grapefruit, lemon zest, pine. The malty aroma carries over to the taste with some difficulty, I think. The pineapple, etc. is still there, but far more subdued. Finishes slighty dry, but still fairly lubricative.  Mouthfeel: Just about right. Just a slight amount more fizz than I'd like, keeping it from perfect, but otherwise oily, slick, and pleasant, like a DIPA should be.  Drinkability: A wonderful, wonderful DIPA. I can see, from this, why so many tout the ""minute"" IPA line from DH. Just a wollop of hoppiness and well-balanced malt sweetness. This is my first DH beer, but with the potential CA distribution plans on the horizon, it hopefully won't be my last.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Jettanbass9,4.15,"Poured into a pint glass, i quickly noticed the thick foam atop the pour. The carbonation moved slowly through the fermented english two row. Quite reminisent of a snow fall. One waft of this beer quickly assured me of what i was getting into. Hops, hops and more hops. Every sip wowed me. I will warn you though, it does have a heavy mouthfeel.

Hops up front and in back, but much more then that. There is a spiceness and smoothness about this that makes this very nicely balanced.

I expected a much bigger smell from this one.  Taste is opposite of the smell. Hop bitterness is a lot more prevalent than the malt. Hop is a grapefruit citrusy taste with very slight alcohol as it warms. Alcohol is hidden very well.  This is a pretty smooth beer that leaves a slight oily coating in your mouth.

Not nearly as intense as most DIPAs I've had, but it shows promise. The taste is immediately hoppy in a nutty, rich, grassy sort of combination, which then combines almost immediately with the strong, caramel-candied malt backbone.

The aroma consisted of a floral, hoppy smell with a hint of banana, maybe, but nothing real significant that stood out to me. The first taste was great - a rich, caramel taste that morphed into a pleasantly bitter finish, with enough punch but no where close to being overpowering. I really didn't notice the 9% alcohol while drinking it (although I did a little later). It was very well-balanced, had a good aftertaste, and overall was very delicious.

One of those brews where there is no doubt in your mind its perfect in taste.  M - Creamy, well carbonated, clean, almost velvety as well. wow  D - I would happily drink a 4 pack with no hesitation.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,swhitt,4.97,"Balance, balance, balance. That's what this brew is all about. 90 minute IPA is the first bitter beer that I fell in love with and I haven't had it for a while. Today, I picked one up again. Wow.  The smell and taste on this one are unsurpassed. Super tasty, it's got the hop flavor covered completely. The alcohol is high, at 9% but you would never know it unless someone felt like telling you. Smell is fresh and herbal. Like a fresh herb that you have just cut.  This is, to be cliche, the king of DIPAs. If you want to make a friend, buy me a 4-pack.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Kendo,4.25,"A: Poured a 12 oz bottle into a Piraat tulip glass. The result -- hazy, orangey-copper with a half-finger white head that disappeared pretty quickly. No evident bubbles, and only limited lacing.  S: Caramel-sweet malt and citrusy and florally hops. The hops aren't as aggressive in the nose as I'd expected (though this is all somewhat subjective, as I gave my wife the glass for a taste and upon smelling it she said ""this is going to be too hoppy for me""). I also noticed the alcohol, more so as it warmed.  T: Caramel sweet, butterscotch-like oily start is quickly assaulted by the florally and citrusy hops. Spicy, peppery alcohol undertones become slightly more pronounced as it warms. It finishes with a dry hoppiness that puckers the tongue and leaves a pretty strong aftertaste.  M: Full-bodied but pretty creamy. Not much in apparent carbonation, but it's not slick in feel -- carbonation makes itself known in the feel.  D: I went back and forth on whether to give this a 4 or 4.5. I finally settled on 4. I've had plenty of 90 Minute IPAs in the past and like most DIPAs, they're pretty heavy. But the balanced flavors of this one make it pretty drinkable -- it's not a one-dimensional hop-bomb at all (unless you get it on the hops infuser), but I did find the aftertaste to detract from its overall drinkability somewhat, and of course, at 9% ABV, you need to be careful.  Notes: I'm not sure how old this bottle was. The ""packaged in"" notch said October or November (it was between the 10 & 11) but there's no year indicated at all. I can't remember when I bought this 4-pack; it's not entirely impossible that this bottle was from a 2004 batch. Regardless, it's definitely been aged at least a year, possibly two, and I think that aging helped to mellow the hops and make for a more balanced DIPA. . . . I've had this on tap in the past, and my recollection is that it was hoppier off the keg, doubly so off of Randall the Enamel Animal when I got it at the Blind Tiger a few years back. I'd like to buy a current vintage and drink it right away to see if the hops would be more pronounced in both the nose and the taste.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,MrHungryMonkey,4.32,"Light golden amber, rich color - quarter inch head - thick foamy - very clear.  Nice strong bitter smell - major citrus vibe.  Bold and strong bitter flavor - some citrus - love those hops - noticeably, but not overbearingly, alcoholic - some mild earthy tones.  Thick - leaves a stirring presence in the mouth - light carbonation.  Great drinker, I could not down this puppy quickly - exquisite.  Overall I really like it. I can really taste the alcohol hiding behind the hops, this seems to tickle the nose. A very nice IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,mmcave,4.37,"Purchased at local liquor store and poured into tulip glass. The head is creamy off white not fluffy, but creamy. It dissipates at a decent pace and leaves thin lacing. The body is a toasty, orange, amber, red. Smells of subtle malt sweetness balanced with hop aromatics. The piney aromatics of the hops are the showcase in this beer, but they in no way are sharp or aggressive. If any thing they sit much further back than the hoppy aggressiveness of most double IPAs. The hops smell of mild pine, grass, some grapefruit and, citrus. There are also some sweet fruity ester qualities manifested from the malt, which to me seems not so common in Double IPA, not that its not pleasing. There also seems to be some coffee and raison in there, possibly from the use of toasted malt. The flavor is much the same, there is some bitterness from hops, but nothing that is really going to knock your socks off like some IPA. The bitterness is well balanced with esters of sweet malt. There are variations in this beer that most IPA or imperial IPAs dont have. This is a very tolerable IPA easy to drink. If you want an IPA that will kick the shit out of you with bitterness (in that good way) this is not the IPA for you, but this is totally a drinkable double IPA to have around, especially in contrast to something as wonderfully hoppy as Dreadnought. This is damn tasty, easy going double IPA if you like your hops wild, its not quite that, but its damn tasty all the same.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,spruce488,4.6,"12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. Poured a great looking burnt orange color, crystal clear. Small white head. Aroma is of instant hops and malt. The hops have citrus and floral tones. Nothing overly complex here. Taste is extremely smooth, with an initial taste of sweet caramel ,honey and malt. It takes a second after swallowing for the delicious, citrusey hops to travel up the back of your tongue. I've had this one before, but forgot how good it actually is.

10099,2093,joe1510,4.32,"12oz. Bottle  90 Minute poured a beautiful dark orange. An aggressive pour produced a 1+ finger head. The head was creamy white along the edges of the glass with moderate bubbles throughout the the center. Decent lacing. Big carbonation bubbles rising from the center of my snifter.  Smell is mostly hops but there is a solid malt backbone. A ton of floral hops along with tropical fruit. Pineapple, mango. I also pick up bubblegum every now and then. Strong hop scent. Makes my mouth water.  Now on to the most important aspect of it all. The taste is up there with some of the best IIPAs I've had. The flavors are exactly like the smell. A solid caramel backbone but the main point is the juicy fruity hops. I was expecting more bitterness but the end is a good balance with only a slight bitterness. As it warms I can feel a warming alcohol in my nose and throat.  Medium bodied. Coats my mouth nicely as I drink. Moderate carbonation tingle on my tongue.  Drinkability is good. It would be a little higher but the alcohol comes out more as it warms.  Overall 90 Minute is an excellent IIPA. The fruity hoppiness is actually refreshing considering the high amount of alcohol in this one. My favorite offering from Dogfish Head so far.  Slainte!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,terrabyte,3.43,"Pours a crystal clear orange body with very little head.  The aroma was much more muted that I expected from a big IPA. There is a hint of grapefruit, and not much else.  Flavor is sweet from alcohol, leaves a slight alcohol burn in the aftertaste. There is a sweetness from a complex fruit collection. Hint of grapefruit (not as much as the armoma led on) and grassy, lemon, and melons. There's a creamy caramel flavor that comes through once in a while, but mostly the bang of the strong aftertaste takes over.  Mouthfeel is a bit foamy and creamy.  Drinkability is a toss up for me. Compared to some of the new wild IPA's trying to outdo each other, this beer has an enjoyable hoppiness that does not tear your taste buds off in the aftertaste. However, at the same time I feel like the alcohol content fills in this void and can be overwhelming.  Very different IPA compared to the dozen I've tried lately. I'm very surprised this scored a ""best IPA"" award from Esquire, although its uniqueness can't be denied.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S - Hops, hops and more hops.  T - A very hoppy beer, as expected. Surprisingly though, there's more to it than that, but I couldn't put my finger on exactly what I was tasting.  M - Just a little thin and a little too fizzy for my liking for an IPA, but still goes down smooth.  D - The smoothness means that one is very drinkable. However, the extreme hoppiness of the beer means that one was definitely enough for me.  All told, a very enjoyable beer, and I think one more suited to being enjoyed by itself rather than paired with any particular food.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,dblinkhorn,4,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Stone IPA glass.  Appearance - Pours a nice honey straw color with a thin half finger somewhat creamy head. This settles at an off-white very thin layer of head atop the brew. Leaves little lacing on the way down, only patches here and there.  Smell - Some thick fruitiness on the nose: peaches, pear. Also some tangy citrus notes with moderate bitterness from the hops. Warming alcohol in the middle, with a nice and rich mellow pudding-like maltiness.  Taste - Moderate bitterness up front with a nice tropical fruitiness. Some mango, lemony citrus, and pear are definitely present. Also some herbal/floral notes from the hops. The initial flavors take back stage to a subdued but deeply rich pudding-like malt character. There is also some light peppery spiciness throughout, but especially in the aftertaste. Also in the aftertaste is some earthiness and a citrus rind flavor.  Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied, and you can tell this when you pour it. It pours nice and viscous. Very smooth with light but refreshing carbonation.  Drinkability - Good drinkability, but the flavors are strong compared to your average IPA. The carbonation is also a lot more mellow than most so its not as fully-refreshing and ""lively.""  A good IPA. Has some good and pronounced flavors. A very good and surprisingly smooth mouthfeel is also a nice asset of this brew. Recommended.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Laced a bit on the sides of the glass. Hoppy smell; some lemon and tangerine, hints of malt. Taste was a bit complex for what I was expecting. Hops and flowers, some richness like a farmhouse ale, slight sweetness to tame the hops from going wild. Alcohol is noticeable, but does not get in the way of enjoyment.

10099,2093,Onibubba,3.85,"A very yummy beer to keep around. I did a side by side last night between this and Terrapin's Big Hoppy Monster. Pours a beautiful clear amber with little to no head. Sweet citrusy hops and a bit of alcohol come through in the smell. Taste is strong - bitter comes through more than the sweet, but the sweet is there. Much more malt balance than with the BHM, and for a beer this hooped up and alcohol assertive, that is a plus.  Mouthfeel and drinkability suffer a bit only because of the intenseness of the hops and the alcohol. Don't get me wrong, the alcohol is well hidden, but there is no question that you are drinking a powerful beer. 2 of these in a sitting would suffice.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Grundle20,4.37,"*This is my edited review of this beer for the draught version plus hop infuser*  Appearance: The beer pours deep copper in color with a relunctantly dissapating fine head into a pint glass. Particulate matter is absent for the most part leaving a clean and clear glass of beer.  Smell: As could be expected not only on tap but blasted through a hop infuser this beer smells intensly of citrus but more prodominantly, apricots. To me apricot isn't really a smell that I want a full nose full of despite how pleasant the taste may be, so this took away from the overall smell of the beer in my case. This may be a bonus for others.  Taste and Mouthfeel: Pleasant carbonation is the first thing I noted with this beer. The beer rolled over my tongue like a mildly sweet gravy of malts and apricots. I really enjoyed how smooth and ""full"" tasting the beer was given it's 9% ABV. There's a huge presentation of citrus grapefruit taste to offset the profound apricot flavor. I found all of these factors to work very well together.  Drinkability: On tap this is truly a treat. It isn't always true that beer is better on tap but it couldn't be more true with this beer. If you don't mind several high alcohol slightly sweet beers in an evening then this beer would probably be perfect for you. It is absolutely delicious!  The Bottom Line: A fantastic ""meal"" beer. I can't stress enough how much better an already good beer is when blasted through a tube of hops. A IPA lovers dream.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,uconnalum2,4.05,"With all the hype surrounding this beer, I couldn't wait to try it. Pours a perfectly clear amber color with a minimal head. The smell hits you with a strong scent of hops as well as some alcohol and citrus sweetness. The taste is intense. Malt up front and then a huge wave of alcohol and hops. A bitter finish but not overly so due to some nice balancing from the malts. Smooth. Mouthfeel is slick with a medium body. A little carbonation lightens it up a bit. The drinkability is better than I expected. The first time I had one, I thought it was a bit overpowering. When I had one a week later, it went down much easier. My taste buds must have adjusted and I'm glad. Overall, this beer is a good choice if you are in the mood for a big, hoppy beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,BeerSox,4.22,"12oz bottle into brandy snifter. Bottled on July 24th 2006.  I sampled this one earlier at a beer fest from a tap, where they also ""Randalized"" it. It was quite hoppy, I must say. This one is consumed from a bottle. I'm curious to see if there is much of a difference.  Pours a clear light amber color when in bright light, but in dim light it is similar to the reddish-pink hue of a white zinfandel (I saw my sister drink one once). Medium sized fizzy head that quickly settles to a cap. Stringy lacing.  Sharp hoppy aroma, spicy yet flowery, sweet and piney. Hints of alcohol sneak past the hops. Bready malts.  The hops at first tend to smack you around a little, then proceed to smack you around a lot. The base consists of he two-row malt. Bits of sweetness can be detected in the middle. Brisk alcohol can be felt throughout. Sweet and smooth at first, with a dry and slightly alcoholic finish. Lingering hopiness lasts for a while.  Lower carbonation in a medium bodied beer, feels very slick and oily. Drier finish, of course.  Sicne I only had a small sample of the Randalized 90 minute, it's hard to say that there is much of a difference. However, I do feel that the Randal process provided a very flowery aroma to the hops, more than enhancing the flavor. Overall, it's a well crafted DIPA. Strong and spicey/floral aroma and a lip smacking hop flavor. Go for it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,bluejacket74,4.5,"This was bottled on 5/8/06. Served in a snifter, the 90 Minute IPA pours a nice copper color, with an off-white head. It mainly smells like floral, grassy and citric (grapefruit) hops. The taste is excellent, it starts out as floral and citric hops, the in the middle there's a caramel/brown sugar like sweetness, then ends with a hoppy bitterness. It's a well balanced brew. The mouthfeel is medium/full bodied, slick and creamy. You can notice the alcohol in this beer, but it's not overpowering. Drinkability is very good, it's smooth even with the high ABV.

10099,2093,Metalmonk,4.72,"Scary how much better this was on tap than the bottle...and the bottle is one of my favorite beers, period. Had this at Mellow Mushroom in Winston-Salem, NC. So good I had to have 2 glasses (which was on top of the Post Road pumpkin ale our group of 3 shared).  The look and smell is just like out of the bottle...nice ruby tint with a modest head that dies quickly...and that grass clippings/grapefruit awesomeness in the nose.  Flavor-wise the tapped version kicks ass. Round, with plenty of depth. Hops and malt both up-front and quite loud in the mouth, both well-balanced while they fight for space. Hops seems both mellow and bitter--not possible, right? But each sip delivered a new take on the beer. And with the most insanely creamy, buttery mouthfeel, every sip was nirvana going down.  Despite a high ABV, this is insanely drinkable...I long for more on tap, but I hope it doesn't make the bottled version unappealing at some point. I doubt it, but man, this tapped version was hot.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Poured a beautiful clear golden hue with a 1 inch head that went to fine lacing after a couple minutes. A strong whiff of citrus and resiny hops. I love this smell, I could smell it all day long. Taste is nice resiny hops, followed by a strong burst of caramel malts that drown out the bitterness a bit which is great. Wow thats good. Mouthfeel starts thick and ends dry, which I am enjoying, makes me want more. Drinkability is high, this is a great beer and could be enjoyed as a treat or as a session.

10099,2093,hammer09,4.03,"This was the last bottle of a 4-pack that I purchased back in April. I drank two of these on the day I bought them, but given the drinking conditons, consumed from an 8 oz. plastic hotel cup (groan!), I didn't think it fair to review the beer at the time. However, I was impressed and gave the third bottle to a fellow hophead. I decided to let the final bottle age for a month or two before drinking it.  Having completely forgotten about this last beer until I discovered it at the back of my pantry this past weekend, I figured it was time to write a review.  Bottled on February 10, 2006, this beer aged very well. Poured into a pint glass, the beer is clear and exhibits a golden-amber hue. I was surprised to find that head development was minimal, but found visible carbonation to be low. The 90 Minute IPA has a prominent hoppy nose with a slight acetone and alcohol aroma. Taste is bitter yet sweet, but not overdone as with other IPAs that I've tried. Flavors are well balanced between malt and hops. Mouthfeel is at first thick and syrupy, but leaving a dry, crisp finish on the palate. Although visual carbonation appears low, the beer is actually well cabronated. Overall, this is a very drinkable brew, and one of my favorites, but given it's 9% abv, is best consumed in moderation.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Very robust and malty with lots of hop bitterness to balance but the hop flavors never really shine. The alcohol level seems a bit high considering the ABV. A solid nicely balanced IIPA without overdoing the hop level. Full bodied and creamy with a light burning alcohol and solid bitter finish.  Very suprising to me and an interesting try.

10099,2093,instrumentality,4,"I bought a pack of these at Lone Hill Liquors in Glendora, CA several months ago, and I've already consumed half of them, so I have a pretty good idea of what to expect: a very hoppy, very richly flavored beer that's about as good as it gets for me in the dIPA world.  Poured into my Stone IRS tulip glass, this poured an impeccably clean amber with a very typically thin but even head.  The odor was an appetizing mix of piney hops and burnt toffee.  The flavor mirrored the odor, although the ""burnt toffee"" effect came with just the slightest hint of toasted coffee beans, along with the strong, burning presence of alcohol.  I'm partial to single IPA's, but I've tried the 60, 90, and 120 minute varieties of Dogfish Head, and in every case, I appreciated and enjoyed what they had to offer.

The smell has a slight piney smell with lots of fruit and alcohol overpowering it. There are some spicy and bread-like smells rounding out the nose. It feels intimidatingly heavy in the mouth, but oh so smooth and creamy.  Holy juices! Immediately you feel the hop presence, which has a strong pine taste. A sweeter malt backbone underscores the front end of the tasting, and the malts, esters, and other fruity flavors start to take over. and make their full effect felt. This is not only a pretty hoppy beer; it is also very malty. Sliding your tongue over the roof of your mouth gives you another burst of hops and alcohol taste, which fades into a dry hoppy finish.  The glass is disappearing more quickly than I had anticipated, which I suppose tells me that this is drinkable despite being a bomby 9% ABV. This is really a beer that has to be tried by any beer lover. It is big, strong, juicy, intense, and delicate all at the same time. The complexity will bring you back to more and more sips.

Oh the aroma. Just a big fat burst of hops. A slightly sweet smell is the perfect balance. It's just teasing me. As it warms up, the hops move to the background and the malt takes over.  The first cold sip is filled with a sweet, hoppy goodness. And a surprisingly strong malt backing. The distinct elements swirl together to create a rich beer that is loaded with flavor. Each sip is sweet, bitter and malty all at the same time. I wonder how long they added hops for.  The feel is a bit fizzy, but does not detract. Still very easy to drink, and smooth considering the higher carbonation. As it warms up and the carbonation goes down, it becomes a creamy, cozy beer.  This beer is very strong. It is delicious, but two or three a month is probably all I could handle.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Its so drinkable for such a big and hoppy beer, which is no small feat. Had this one simultaneously with BWFH a few weeks back at a little session with fellow BAs raider and chonyr. the BWFH just didnt compare to this fine double IPA.  Appearance A nice clear amber ale poured with a 1/2 finger light tan head. Intricate, fine lacings were produced by this finely carbonated ale.  Aroma What a big, rich, and resinous ale. Pine and grapefruit almost cover sweet caramel malts, and a touch of toast, with a hint of nuttiness.  Taste What a big, sweet, bitter, and resinous ale. The sweet, buttery caramel, toasty, and nutty malts are smothered in resinous, hoppy flavours of pine and grapefruit peel. Interesting pineapple-like flavours become more evident as this ale is enjoyed.  Mouthfeel What a big, sweet, and bitter balanced DIPA. This is a full bodied, almost creamy, astringent ale. Theres a little alcohol heat in the finish, but its amazingly well hid in this brew. The light carbonation nicely accentuates this brew, preventing it from being cloying.  Drinkability This is an amazingly drinkable full bodied, richly malted, and heavily hopped DIPA. The wonderful balance between rich malts and resinous hops actually allow this big beer to be a great, decadent session brew.

Aromas are floral, and spicy, almost peppery, with a bready grain hint, and not as much citrus as I was expecting. Taste was unlike anything I've had. I was fully bracing myself for an over the top hop blast straight to the face but what I got was something unexpected. There was a nice hop bitter punch right in the beginning, but then it just mellows out with a malty smoothness that is unreal. Tha balance is incredible for a 9% IPA. Sweetness is definitely present, almost too much at some points, and a touch of alcohol lingers in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is one of a kind, smooth, chewy, sticky....very nice.

Very drinkable, to the point where it's a good thing it's expensive or it would be very easy to over-indulge. I usually like mildly hopped malty beers - browns, scotch ale, etc & only tried this because you have to at least taste anything new you come across & I was shocked at how good it tasted especially after getting a huge wiff of hops when it was opened. Not something to be swilled but enjoyed slowly.

Appearance- Pours a beautiful rich, reddish gold with an amazing continuous flow of streaming action in the glass. The creamy ivory head swells to just over two inches, then retreats to a stalwart centimeter of foam. Miles of lacing in large, unbroken sheets stick to the inside of the glass. Extremely fresh looking beer and really appetizing.  Smell- This is it... the reason some of us love IIPAs and cannot stop smelling them. A gorgeous nose of juicy, honeyed grapefruit and sticky, green pine needles... backed with malt and balanced to perfection.  Taste- A slick, silky, fresh hop fix that puts others in its class in detention. There is a meatiness to the taste, a fullness to the malts that compliments the big, citrusy hop character. A masterpiece for this style.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- A few words to describe the mouthfeel: oily, creamy, slick, viscous, silky... it's awesome. The 9% is nowhere but in the eventual body warmth... and the burps are a review on their own. At $9 a four-pack, this isn't cheap beer... but I don't hesitate to keep this a constant presence in my fridge.

There seems to be a little lack of carbonation, or some residue in the glass given to me.  The smell is of citrus, hops, caramel malts, some raisin and floral notes. The flavor offers light citrus, the caramel malts, strong, bright hops, some candy, sugar, and a burst of alcohol.

You get candy sweetness from the malts upfront. It continues through the middle and ends bitter with a semi sweet citrus hop aftertaste. Not very complex but very well balanced and flavorful. Borderline full bodied. This one seems a little syrupy. Carbonation is good though. Could stand to be a bit lighter in body.

The taste is very enjoyable and well-balanced between the hops and barley, tasting very similar to a good barley wine. Bittersweet perfection.

10099,2093,bort11,4.4,"12 oz bottle courtesy of SkinnyElvis. Thanks man.  Poured into a tulip glass. Not a very lage head at first, maybe a 1/4 inch, but the lace has a wonderful staying power. A wispy cap that circles the center and a solid ring around the edge.  Smell is very mild, yet complex. It's a bit buttery, smokey, and bitter. Smell leaves a warmth in the back of the sinuses. Taste follows smell very well. As you breath it in through your mouth you can taste it. It's a little salty, which just make me thirsty for more. A very smokey finish in the after-taste  Mouthfeel is a little on the oily side, which must be coming from the added hops. I really like the way it lingers on the tongue. It feels like it soaks in at the mouth. A slight alcohol warmth is present.  This is a very smooth IPA, in the sense of a fine Scotch. Very enjoyable indeed.

I've been saving this for a special occasion, so I figured my wedding was a good enough excuse to finally try it!  It pours a dark orange with a creamy head; smells grassy and of citrus. I have to give the coveted 5.0 for taste - tastes of hops and sweetness (lemon-honey?), but despite the 9.0 ABV, there's only a slight alcohol kick. Goes down VERY smooth for a higher-alcohol IPA.

A tinge of honey-like aromas and suggestions of alcohol esters- but they are very well hidden. Incredible  Taste- Again, hops are most prevalent as expected. Tastes of honey and light, yet syrupy-thick malty flavors. Alcohol esters at the finish but certainly not enough to be distracting.  Mouthfeel- Honey-like in some ways- but obviously not that thick. Excellent carbonation level.  Drinkability- For 9% it goes down very easily. I could drink this all day long.  Everytime I have this I am amazed at how such a big beer can be so amazingly well balanced. It puts a lot of other really good Imperial IPAs to shame.

That's not in order! But I digress...) Pours a light copper with little head and little carbonation. Aroma of sweet sugars and hops. Taste is quite sweet, and the alcohol is noticeable. This reminds me of a barleywine - a style that I generally have not taken well to as they tend to be too sweet for my tastes. The DFH 90 does not have the fullness of flavour and aroma and hops that I enjoyed in the DFH 60.

Smell - Besides the great floral hop presence, I also picked up a lovely fruity aroma. This aroma somewhat reminded me of dates or maybe plums. Finally, a nice sticky alcohol smell made itself known gradually as the beer warmed.  Taste - Hop bitterness from start to finish on this one ladies and gents. Add to that the chewy maltiness and a sweet alcohol flavor at the end, and this ends up being one fine tasting DIPA.  Mouthfeel - Medium to full. It really coats the palate.

Aroma: Incredibly sweet, honey and candy-like, with a very substantial pine hop undercurrent. The aroma is very, very strong, so much so as to almost manifest a sensation of taste.  Taste: Very sweet from start to finish, with a pronounced honey-like presence, like barley cake drenched with honey. Though secondary to the malt, there is a very strong hop component, which manifests itself as pine tar and a mild herbal note. This lingers mildly well past the end of the taste.  Mouth feel: Rich and full, syrupy and soft.  Drinkability/notes: While I am less than a hop aficionado, this is a superb beer, to be sipped and savored.

10099,2093,NoLiberty,4.03,"Have had this beer many times, but most recently at Bridget Foy's in Philadelphia, which has suddenly begun specializing in an all local 12 tap draft list. Nice. While big props go out to Dogfish Head for their innovation in the big IPA series and with Randall, despite Russian Rivers foaming about unnecessary hop devices, the double and triple IPA market is no longer what it was even 2 years ago. With ever more breweries pushing not only the IBU limit but also the quality and flavor of these big beers there's ever more pressure on DFH to stay competitive. While 90 minute is still a wonderful beer it no longer ranks among the top in this category for me.  The beer is poured into a fluted chalice with a white two finger head. Color is deep orange-copper and completely clear.  The aroma builds from a clean almost estringent smell to a biting sharp cheddar in the back of the nose with sweet alcohol and rosy malts rounding out the smell.  The taste overall is balanced, but slightly more alcohol than I would have liked. Front is this sharp cheddar bite with middle of sweet alcohol and hay followed by a nice piney hop finish and clean end. Lingering reminder of an aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is good, nice carb, mouth filling but not overly thick with alcohol. Body is good but not full.  Drinkability is also quite high, but with the significant alcohol content and flavor it may not be as highly drinkable as others.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Raison and fruitcake are definitely there (don't mean to copy their website, but its true). If you get over all the hops, and really pay attention, there is plenty of malt there as well. Very nice.  Mouthfeel is very thick considering the 9% alc/vol. I am impressed they pulled that off, the thickness just balances out with all the flavor. Amazing.  Not something you'd want to drink all night...not because its bad, but because its something you'd choose to savor. When you're done, you look forward to your next one...days or weeks down the road.

Deep gold and perfectly clear with a good solid head. lots of rising carbonation. Very inviting.  Very high hop bitterness as would be expected. The big hit of hops follows up with good malt backbone. Sweet caramel malt flavor. The aftertaste is mostly a resiny/oily hop flavor. It's a pleasant linger, not a scorching of the taste buds like some DIPAs seem to be.  Body is on the high end of medium, not quite full bodied. Fairly high carbonation gives it a lively extra little bit of bitter effect.  Amazingly drikable. This in no way feels like a 9% beer. There's no alcohol burning, the body is biggish but not more so than most 6-7% IPAs.

This beer is one of my favorites because of the texture and tasty hoppy goodness.  Pouring it into a glass, you can hear how thick it is. It just coats the sides of the glass while releasing a beatiful bouquet of hoppy green smelling goodness.  Initially the hops overwhealm, but after the initial bite, you taste the strong malt undertones and the small bite of the alcohol.

10099,2093,Deconstructionis,2.26,"Dogfish Head may be the most over-hyped brewery on the planet. The 120 minute ale is simply torture to drink and a perfect example of ""too much of a good thing,,,"" I like spicy food and rare meat. However, I grasp the fallacy in thinking that therefore raw pork and 20 habaneros is a great meal.  This is much better but still far from a good beer. I love IPAs and other hop heavy styles but there is a a raw quality to this beer that reminds more of green wood than anything else. The alcohol is dialed way back from the 120 but is still far too prevalent throughout. Behind the hops and alcohol and pine wood you can actually taste some malt in this one and it lacks the sickening raw sugar taste of the 120. However being a better drink than the 120 is akin to being a better eat than grubs.  To me this is just another overpriced bad beer reliant on image and the tendency of people to want to like things that set them apart from the masses. Sometimes, the masses are right -- people are wasting money becayse they put status over good taste.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,RedChrome,4.54,"A nice medium amber colorresulted from the pour. A fluffy white one inch head rapidly dissipated. A small amount of tiny carbonation bubbles are rising through the beer. Lacing clumps down glass.  The aroma of hops nearly jumped out of the bottle from the moment it was opened. A first whiff of the pour was a fantastic floral aroma. Huge scents of citrus are also strongly present. A grapefruit and lemon blend is perfect.  A fantastic flavor that brings all the elements of the aroma to the mouth. A nice taste of citrus is the major flavor. The grapefruit is downplayed to the lemon. A finish of hops bitterness helps the sweetness of lemon have a nice balance. Just a slight end of alcohol burn takes away from perfect taste.  A nice thick mouthfeel makes for a coating of flavor on all parts of mouth. Only a slight pop of carbonation to highlight the flavor.  An excellent beer. This beer would be a fantastic choice to compliment to a nice piece of salmon with a smoked sauce.

10099,2093,warmstorage,3.03,"12 ounce bottle, $9.99 for a four pack. Pours a medium slightly hazy orange copper color, retains a thickish lacy head.  Smells of fruit, perfume, fruit, perfume, fruit, and slightly earthy hops.  Perfumy, sweet fruit apricot peach, slight plum (like the spot between the tart skin and sweet flesh.) Blood oranges. Tropical fruit. Hop presence is fruity and delicious, finishes with a thick sweet mouth, and lingers long with fruit and bready malt. Slightly smoky notes as it warms to room temp. Alcohol presence is notable, but not pronounced for 9%.  This might sound strange, but it's sort of like a thicker, sweeter, supercharged version of Magic Hat #9.  This is a delicious, delightful, fun beer. But some kind of standard bearer for IPA as a style, or DIPA? I don't see it -- at all. The four pack screamingly brags ""THE BEST IPA in AMERICA!"" While it's arguably asinine to rely on Esquire Magazine for such a ruling, DFH are the ones who have adopted it and printed it on their packaging. And, uhhh, it's just not. It's not even close.  I have to dink it in ""quality"" and ""aroma"" since I don't have the option for breaking these out for style, and for overall taste. If I were handed this in a blind tasting and told it was an exprimental category, fruit beer orinated strong ale, I'd probably give it 4.5 or 5 in both categories. I gave it a 4.5 for drinkability, and was tempted to give it a 5, but it *could* potentially be improved on, and I don't give 5s lightly. But as a DIPA (my favorite style)?

Boozy taste sweet with malt and toffee flavors that outweigh even 90 minutes worth of hop bitterness.

Bready malts peak out from behind the hops. This manages to give off hardly any alcohol smell. The sweetness from the residual sugars of the malt hit the tongue first followed by a heap of citrus and pine from the hops. There is a slight breadiness from the malts and the hop bitterness is soft. Gets a somewhat medicinal character from the alcohol. Hops don't seem to be enough to balance the sweet.

Poured into a pint glass with a resulting head that was pretty thin and off-white in color. The head dissipates to a thin crown that sticks around a good while, leaving nice rings of sticky lace. The color is a beautiful amber that is very clear, showing a few rising bubbles.  The aroma is earthy with nice floral hoppiness.  The taste is exceptional with a over the top hop flavor that is leafy and earthy. The mouthfeel is both tangy and tart. There is a touch of alcohol burn that lends a warming touch and feel to the taste. There is a nice mix of malts blended in.  Overall, one of the best ipas I have tasted.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,wl0307,4.62,"Tasted on cask(!!) at the BSF bar, GBBF 06. Coz all the other American cask-conditioned beers (30+ of them) failed to arrive in time for the beer festival, due to the unforgivable mistake by the shipping company, this was the only American cask ale available on stillages (two casks in total for the whole event...). But what a beer it was esp. on cask!! Gravity-dispensed.  A: pours a bright, orangey amber hue, very clear and low carbonation; no sign of beer head which is pretty normal for a gravity-poured real ale. S: flowery essence, like Osmanthus fragrans, mountain-flower honey, juicy but sticky lychee jam, light note of basil leaves, plus a deeper scent of sweet oranges... all elements rolled in one, on top of a great, thick body of caramely maltiness yet without a single trace of sharp alc. for this 9%abv. beer... brilliant! T: oily smooth in texture, with soothing flows of pine-oil, flowery and sweet grapefruity hops caressing the tongue... In the mid-taste lots of juicy longan-fruits come forward, closely ensued by a profound taste of licorice, dried root-spices and flowery petals, leading towards a balanced, tangy bitter and lo...ng finish with just a healthy kick of alc. down the throat. Hops leave great length of aroma and depth of bitterness at the back, but not at all harsh or intrusive on the mouthfeel as one might suspect of a DIPA. Sheer brilliance~~ M&D: smoothly-textured, the fizziness is much much softer than most American beers I've had, due to the cask-conditioning I'm sure. In a way the taste and aroma are not so much bold and thick as the bottled version, but for any cask-conditioned ale lover, this gem on cask really is unbeatable. Lovely nectar, to say the least... can't have enough of it!!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Amber colored and bubbly with a fantastic off-white head. Smeels hoppy and oily...maybe TOO oily...still smells good. Mmmm..this IS good. It might be the best tasting of the big-hop beers i've had. Lives up to its name and more...not too hoppy or bitter and quite smooth actually with a touch of lemon and sweet caramel malt in the flavor. Delicious.

Great overall aroma, IPA spiciness and fruity aroma. Taste is outstanding, rank it up there with Bigfoot (less harsh) and Celebration Ale. Hops bitterness, incredible smoothness and strong fruit flavor. Great balance between the fruit and the bitterness. Mouthfeel is rich with great flavor throughout, no heavy alcohol aftertaste to ruin the experience. I know this is 9% abv, but drinkability is still good. If I didn't have to drive, I would do up to three of these over a long session and still enjoy every drop.

10099,2093,BeerNutta,4.72,Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA.  Got this from Central Market in Texas. America is beer heaven.  A = Poured a dark copper with a thick foam head that dissapates leaving a fluffy foam lace.  S = An infusion of Hop and fruits. Very very inviting.  T = Inital sweet grape taste with a hint of pears and apples. Followed through with a smooth hop finish.  M = Smooth to mouth with a slight hop bite.  D = Very drinkable. I could see myself drinking a few in a session.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,TheFeintingGoat,4.54,"12 oz. bottle poured into a Weizen Glass. Very excited to get this in my small little town, and at 9.99 for a four pack, moderatly well priced.  Pours a clear copper tone with a nice head and moderate carbonation, a nice differential in bubble speeds is a plus. Smells very hoppy, gives my nose a burn. Cinnamon and sugar also worked in there. Very fresh picked smelling. Very sweet and matly on the forefront, giving way to a sticky, taffy like taste. On the back is a moderate hops bite, that comes back up after the swallow to leave a sticky hops taste that's reminiscent of toffee in the back of your throat. This may seem contradictory, but it finishes very clean and leaves the feeling that you've just eaten something very strong. The mouthfeel is light in body and the hops comes out to play a bit, but never get to the point where one thinks they should (a plus). A pleasant balance is achieved here. Drinkability? Hmm. It's nice and light, but commands you to taste every sip. Lots of malts and sweet flavors at first which gradually let the hops through while maintaining center stage until after the swallow. The finish is quite sticky and hoppy, resin-like if you will. The head sticks around quite a long time as well. I could drink 2 of these at a sitting, I believe (the price is too high to try right now). It's a great summer beverage that can use it's sweet, resin-like textures to be perfect in winter too. Decently complex, this is a great brew-- (and at 9% ABV) packs a bit of a wallop too.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

A hint of spices too, which create a nice balance with the other two. The initial taste is malty, with the last 75% consisting mostly of well-balanced hops. The consistency is thick, almost chewy, but just amazingly smooth all the way around. Mouthfeel is great, with a lingering hop taste, and the drinkability is also high. A tremendous beer, too bad they only sell it in 4 packs.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,rustymoore,4.45,Dogfish Head is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries. This IPA pours an amberish gold with a nice medium head and minimal lacing. Smells strong with hops and malts. Some floral notes as well. Tastes is overpowered by the heavy use of hops. The bitter kick is what beer drinking is all about. Mouthfeel is somewhat acidic but overall this is a beer I could drink regularly.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Complex beer with plenty of kick. Hops knock you for a loop and somehow it all tries to balance out but the hops easily TKO the citrus. Hoppy smell, dark gold in color, this wonderful Imperial IPA shouts perfection. The best way to describe the taste...""I am not going to be driving today.""

10099,2093,rayjay,4.07,"Bottled 05/31/06. Driven in a cooler from Philadelphia. I used to drink this alot before I moved to CA about 3 years ago. Since then, I've drank alot more 2xIPAs and I'm curious to see how my palate has changed.  Pretty, golden color and small head. Oily circles on top. Unfortunately like so many DF beers, there is absolutely no lacing.  Taste is like a hoppy bakery. A bit flat, and a bit thick. Alcohol warms your throat during the aftertaste, which is hoppy but surprisingly sweet. Malty thickness reminds me of a strong lager, with that east coast malt presence that seems to define the region. Almost tastes like the fermentation stopped early, but the high alcohol level tells me otherwise (unless they just add grain alcohol to it!).  Hops are delicious. Bitter but mellow at the same time. Not grapefruit, more like tart oranges, also some cayanne pepper, pungent fruitcake. Not particularly floral. Maybe I'm immune, but I'm longing for a bit more bitterness. A real warm sensation like I just had a shot of whiskey. Come to think of it, this has a pretty whiskey-like thing going on with the taste too. Much like a nice, sweet bourbon. As they say on the east coast, ""mad props, yo.""  Unfortunately, I had this on tap at the Double IPA fest at the Bistro last Feb and it did not hold it's own against the best of the best. Of course, this rating is for the bottle in front of me. I'd love to try this on a fresh packed randall the enamal animal!  This beer lacks a big hop punch and I don't really dig the carmel malts so out front, but....  It was very enjoyable. I've been pretending it's whiskey, that made me love it more. Appreciate this for what it is and don't compare it to Frank or Pliny and it will love you back. Cheers!!!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The appearance was typical: some light lace on the glass, very little head; dark copper color; clear  The aromas were muted given the high hop volume. Most notable unusual smell: a touch of lemon.  This is a big flavor beer. I like how balanced the beer is considering it is an Imperial IPA. There is enough malt to counter the high hop. I think this how an IIPA should taste.

I am very happy with the balance of this beer, it does favor the hops (as well a dipa should) but there is a nice balance, some of the dipa's I like are more malty than this (stoudts), but this balance is prolly more true to style some piney smells poping in, as it goes down, nice lacing on the glass.  nice Mouthfeel, good medium body.  Good beer, but kinda normal. This SHOULD be the bud light of america.. but..unfortunatly bud light is. 9% sits well and only adds to the flavor profile, never gets out of line and over powered.  2 thumbs up and a cheers, grand dipa, i just like more malts.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S: Loads of fresh citrus hops with a bready sweet malty sweetness. Served a little too cold so it took a few minutes for the fullness of the smells to really be expressed. When they do, the mix of hops and malt is quite appealing. T: Loads of citrus hop flavor - sweet oranges and pink grapefruit with a nice spicy zest. Bittering hops give a floral or herbal note. Maltiness balances & unites all the flavors. A bit of alcohol flavor, too. M: Full mouthfeel and body. Some alcohol warm towards the back and sides of the tongue. Smooth and almost creamy, although this becomes slightly sticky the warmer the beer gets. D: A strong beer at 9% but certainly delicious enough to have more than one.

Poured meium-dark redish gold with a huge white foamy head that stuck around for a while. This beer is very attractive in a pint glass.  As soon as I poured it, a very strong oily hop smell was immediatley noticable. The smell is very powerful! You can almost taste it through your nose! Grassy, sweet, floral and somehow very marijuana-esque. I smell sweet over-ripe fruit....dates and raisins and maybe...dried apricots?  Taste. Again, very, very, hoppy sweet at first and bitterness comes latter. Tastes like pure hops... very, very good! The key word is complexity and intrigue...there is alot going on here. I taste raisins, dates, and yeast behind the hops. As with the smell, I detect a distinctly marijuana-like taste going on here. Come to think of it....raw hops do look suspiciously familiar...  The high alcohol content warms the mouth, and a very oily or greasy feel predominates followed by an extremely dry wave of hop bitterness. Makes ya wanna cluck your toungue to get the most of the hop taste. Lip-smackingly good!  I couldn't see myself drinking more than one in one sitting, but this is awesome...definitely a favorite!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,dfried,4.32,"Golden orange in color, thick, oily and fluffy white head.  The aroma is hops, hops, and more hops, the full spectrum, floral and citrus like, but very musty and resinous at the same time. Though the hops are so pungent, you can still detect sweet pale-malty backbone as well. Mouthwatering.  For a DIPA, the taste is surprisingly balanced...for a DIPA. The sweet malt was always up front when you take a sip, before you get slammed by hops. Hops in beer, for hopheads anyway, do not really get better then they were in this beer. They started with a bitter, musty, resinous feel, and that pretty much lasts throughout the beer, but it finishes with tons of citrus and perfume-y flavors. Orange, apricot, peach.   Edit: now that I am a little older and wiser, and more experienced with DIPAs, it is still true that this beer is a hop bomb, but compared to others of the style I have tried, this one is a malty beast, and I dropped the scores to where they should be.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Not overpowering, though. It is warm, subdued hint of alcohol behind a note of cherry and brandy. As I smell deeper there is a rawness to it, almost overpowering the aforementioned maltiness. Earthy hop aromas abound, along with hints of pine and citrus.  Again, alcohol is the first taste that I detect, but again it is warm and balanced by the multitude of flavors which are in this beer. A syrupy, sugary cherry malt flavor lies within a bed of chewy, oily hop leaves that impart citrus, earthy, and piney flavors.  One of the better Double IPAs I've had.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Damian,4.79,"Poured a bright amber-orange with a small, pillowy head that faded quickly.  Smell was incredibly aromatic. Peaches, citrus fruits and smooth, mellow hops were noticeable.  Taste was a perfect balance of flavorful malts and savory hops with an aftertaste of ripe fruits. This balance allowed the beer to avoid the ""hop bite"" that is typical of many other DIPA's. Furthermore, the 9% alcohol was hardly detectable.  Overall, an incredibly flavorful and easy drinking example of this style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Dizzy,4.57,"Pours lighter amber color with white head (which sticks around a bit). Aroma is hops (mainly citrus smell).

Taste - Ridiculous depth. The most full-rounded hop profile of any IPA I have ever had. Pine, grapefruit....At first it's a sweet piney flavor and then turns bitter dry with all types of hops punching you in the palate. Like taking a shmorgashborg of hops and stuffing them in your mouth, this beer and hop profile stays with you long after you take in your sip. Simply marvelous.  Mouthfeel - liquid velvet, perfect amount of carbonation, superb.  Drinkability - I could drink these 24/7 if only they weren't 9.0% alcohol. heh....Seriously the perfect Imperial IPA.

Aroma:  Sweet madeira, vanilla oak, a chewy bready yeastyness, and malts out the kazoo. Hops have settled substantially over the years.  Taste/Mouthfeel:  Sweet sherry, resonating with a complex woody oak masking a subtle, yet insistent alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is full and viscous leading to a sublime smoothness. Sadly this is the last of it's kind. DFH doesn't make 90 Minute IPA in the 750 mL anymore, and it will be sorely missed.

10099,2093,JudgeRoughneck,4.18,"An amazingly clear, luminous, new-copper colored beer supports a huge sudsy bright white head with large carbonation bubles racing to the top. They pop to unleash an amazing hop bouquet of fresh pine, honey, berry, citrus, and nut, followed by alcohol. I just wish it were a tad stronger.  The taste is something very special, even if it is less complex than the nose had led me to hope for. Mostly what you're getting here is a deeply bitter, very resinous IPA with perfumey berry and notes of vinous fruit that are quickly consumed by alcohol. At first alcohol seemed to play the perfect role here, present, forceful, but not overwhelming. As the beer warmed however, it gradually made its way in more and more and got to be a bit much in the end. What overall impressed me here was the way this beer was able to deliver big beer qualities, killer bitter, and still stay very ""bright"" while doing so.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

One of the most pleasant smelling beers I've encountered.  The taste is perfect. Oily hops throughout, but with a strong malt backbone. Notes of citrus, pine, (maybe coffee?), bread. Nothing really overpowers anything else, it all blends together in a delightful medley of flavors.  This is smooth in the mouth, but leaves a nice hops aftertaste. It's really got a kick to it. Less than halfway through the bottle and I'm already feeling its effects.  This is perhaps the best beer I've ever had. I was hesitant at the price ($15.20 for a 4-pack), but it was well worth it for the experience. It was much maltier than I expected.

The aroma was of citrus, grapefruit, and a sweet/syrupy smell. This aroma, however, was fairly weak. The taste was a nice, blended caramel, malt, syrup sweetness mixed with a fruity, citrus hop flavor. Very seamless mingling of flavors with a slightly dry, hop finish. Certainly not a bitter, hops-in-your-face IPA. The mouthfeel was medium-thick and slightly syrupy. Smooth.

10099,2093,BabaJohn,3.77,"If this brew and the raison detre I tried a few weeks ago are telling, then Dogfish Head might have a knack for emphasizing the sweet malts of their beverages.   The 90 minutes poured a shade darker than light amber with some nice reds and deep oranges, and very little head. Smelled quite delicious in that IPA way with sweet fragrances slightly predominating over the hops. Taste was immediately of malts plus a bit of bite on the tongue (both remained throughout consumption). The sweetness was almost like candy at times. Sometimes when I drink beers like this the term sickly-sweet comes to mind. Had the same experience recently with a delirium tremens. Dont get me wrong, I like sweet beers, especially of the Belgian variety, but there is a point when it becomes overpowering and out of balance with the rest of the drink. The desert-like quality of the 90 minutes IPA and the relatively high alcohol content might make this a bit less drinkable overall. It is definitely a tasty beverage but I wanted a bit more out of the hop side of this IPA.  Ok... so I want to make a slight change to my previous statements. It may not be that the hops are at fault here, but I just wanted the sweet malts to back off a bit. That's it for now...",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,DaveFL1976,3.76,"Is it possible to have too much of a good thing?  I like hops. I'm a hophead. Victory Hop Devil is absolutely one of my favorite beers. But the DFH 90 minute goes a bit too far in the piney/resinous hop arena. Maybe I'm just a Cascade sort of guy. I like my citrusy hops.  Anyways, it's a great looking beer. Smells good, too. Taste is sweet due to the tremendous amount of malt that it takes to bump up to 9%, and then the hops try to balance things out. They do, but abrasively.  It's a good beer, but I'll take a Hop Devil over a 90-minute.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Had this on tap this weekend and in the nose I also noticed a rose petal and very skunky herb aroma. Its taste was initial hops followed by a very sweet finish. Also tastes like eating marijuana nuggets while drinking this.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,msemich,4.05,"Having read the other reviews, I am afraid that the level of hops in this variety may cause intrer-batch inconsistencies in flavor; I would expect that much has to do with the serving type.  I came upon several bottle of this brew in an Asheville wine store and picked up a 6'er. For me, this was a very good IPA in the American style. It packs a whollop of hops up front, with the alcohol and the mouthfeel coming in at the last moment to give it some variety.  This is what I would call a 'floral' IPA, double packed, that finishes earthy and sweet. This is not for the faint-of-hop-hearted. The flavor of the malt is somewhat masked behind the hops, but thru the alcohol you can get the distinct flavor of the heavy amounts used to product 9% ABV.  As far as serving goes, I drank half from the bottle and half from a tulip glass. On some bottles I gently inverted them to pick of the sedemented hop oils (doesn't work well on all IPA's, YMMV) with great results. I would almost say that I prefer this brew from the bottle, starting very cold and allowing it to breathe for a few minutes before enjoying.  Intense American IPA's are often regarded as ""unbalanced and undigestible"" by the Belgians and others, but to me this is the definition of the style. Its hoppy...really hoppy, like it or don't buy it.  I would put this into the same category (though not as purely drinkable) as Bell's Two Hearted or a really good Harpoon.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Solomon420,4,"Overall a great beer and for this style above average. The color was nice and reddish-amber almost honey. The head was smallish and left after the first few swigs. The smell was nice, hoppy and fresh, but not too hoppy. Some light tantilizing evergreen scent in there...just inviting me in for a drink. The flavor was pleasantly on the sweet side with a tad bit of alcohol and hops in the end. It was a bit on the thicker side with not too much carbonation. I liked this beer and will quickly look to buy more next time I can.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,MuenchenerKindl,4.57,"Poured Vom Fuss at the DFH Ale House into a large snifter. The liquid is a bright & shinning clear amber with small bubbles pushing up a modest 1 finger head. The results of a professional pour. The head fades slowly leaving just a little lace on the glass.  The smell is very sharp, lost of the finest hops, fresh and slightly spicy. Defiantly getting the grapefruit scent with fresh pine needles. Some malt is present through a have of 9.0 ABV.  Taste is in step strong bitter sweet grapefruit, some malt. Lots of alcohol in the mix. Fresh is it, this beer is very pleasing and powerful in its tastes. It was perfect to wash down the Strong Mussels in a quite flavorful rosemary sauce. Oh Yeah!  Mouth feel is a medium body, wine like effervescences in the small bubble carbonation. Very nicely balanced to play with the big ABV.  Drinkability is very good with or without food. You may not want too many but if you pace your self well it won't beer because of the beer taste that you stop. This is defiantly a standard in the bier keller. Zum Wohl! Und Prost!

Citrus and pine needle aroma, matching the resinous, bitterness of the taste. Each sip lingers with the hops and malt battling away. The long finish ends with an orange and tangy dryness. It's well attenuated, but the depth of the flavor profile gives an impression of a medium body. Very drinkable.

10099,2093,snbcdewey,2.61,The beer is very sweet and malty. There was so much hype about the beer I had to try. It is not a very balanced product. Lot's of yeast up front. Good Hoppy taste but mouthfeel was all over the board. Nice to see more hoppy style beers coming from the East Coast. There is a distinct palate difference between the East and West coast. Dogfish has a great PR motivation. Everyone wants to sample their beers.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,hunteraw,4.15,"Poured into a snifter at the Gaithersburg location of Dogfish Head Alehouse.  Appearance: an orange-tinted honey, smaller head than I expected (although so much of that depends on the pour...), moderate lacing. Slightly hazy. Nice looking beer.  Smell: Lots of fresh hops aroma with some pine notes, and a tantalizing dark-fruit sweetness in the background.  Taste: First impressions: I didn't expect it to be so sweet, but i guess this is a double IPA. Pretty much the same profile as the aroma: dominant hops with a strong sweet backbone, with some alcohol warming also present. Finishes on a dry note, surprising considering the sweetness here and very agreeable to my tastes.  Perhaps a touch undercarbonated in the mouthfeel department, otherwise what you'd expect. Overall, this was a very good beer but it didn't quite meet my expectations (granted they were too high). Too sweet to be a sessioner for me, personally.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,nicefix,4.62,"Appearance - Medium amber color, very clear. Slightly off white two finger head that thins out in a couple of minutes. Great lacing.  Smell - Citrus, berry, hops, malt.  Taste - Big hop punch with everything mentioned on the smell plus a mild alcohol finish. Exceptional, one of my favorite IPA's. Sorry I can't explain more of the taste, but my inexperienced palate can't comprehend or translate a comparison.  Mouthfell - Smooth, nice carbonation. Medium body.  Drinkability - Very drinkable, but be carefull. The high ABV is deceiving. You will get drunk quick after a couple of these. My opinion on this brew? Very good, one of the best I've had, wish I could try it on tap. Expensive, so I tend to savor it when I get the chance.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Mdog,4.92,"Appearance: Deep Gold, nice head that leaves lots of lacing on the glass.  Smell: I smell some pear and apple, then alcohol and citrus.

Cross the border into Wisconsin and usually these are available. Just a great beer!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Layers upon layers of hoppy aromatic complexities...with red fruits, tangy tart candies, pineapple and grapefruit all over the place. The malt smells totally thick and sweet, mostly caramel and honey.  The flavors just explode, i really can't believe how sweet the malt is, it's a caramel and honey extravaganza and a hop bomb with a big malt presence. The depth and complexity of the hop flavor is the best...and still the best I've seen for this style: Red fruits, sweet pineapple with a grapefruit bitterness and piney, resinous taste and feel. Impressive.  This has a full body feel with a medium body look, very hefty and thick on the palate but not without a good bite as well. The malt heft makes it feel huge but it's got a really nice zip and bite with plenty of life too.  This one sets a standard for the Imperial IPA and I seem to judge most others on this version, a classic for sure in all ways. It's fun to age or drink fresh.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Bitterness and flavor from the hops is present from the start unitl well after the swallow.  M: Full-bodied and oily with subtle carbonation.  D: I enjoy this beer quite a lot for not liking the DIPA style that much. The brewers at DFH have managed to create a big hoppy beer that doesn't taste like a celery stick or pine sap. I usually don't like throwing down $9.99 for a 4-pack, but this is one exception I don't mind. This gets a high score here for being one of the only DIPA's that I would order over a typical IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,GregBrewski,4.07,"Only the second IPA I have ever had, so just getting used to and loving this style. Appearance was amber/redish with a decent head. Nice smell, fruity (probably of citrus) and sweet malt. The taste is suburb, from what I remember, I like prefer this one over the 60 min IPA. It has a bitter taste with plenty of hops. Its very smooth but not all that drinkable, due to its high alcohol content. Overall, supurb beer!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,andythejerk,4.2,"Good color--decent head, but the head reduces soon to a generous, bubbly lace. Smells like an IPA with a sweet, bubble-gum wrapper around it. But this is NOT what I have come to expect from an IPA or especially an imperial IPA. Usually I feel like they are just trying to show their hop muscle, and nothing else. This has a different hop character that is still serious, but smoother and much, much more drinkable than ANY IPA I have ever experienced. The finish is long and beautiful and really shows off the extra barley character of this brew. As a person who avoids IPA's but does drink them and appreciate them, I am very much enjoing this brew and still respecting it for not compromising the hop-forward character that I feel is essential to the IPA style. Maybe it's the ""ridiculous amounts of barley"" that make it this classic, quality beer with a fantastic, long finish. I'm drinking an IPA that's far from insipid and in no way hop-shy, but still a quality, balanced brew that normal people like me can drink and enjoy.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,BDTyre,4.63,"My first foray into Dogfish Head's brews. I managed to get both this and the 120 Minute IPA while in Seattle. I didn't think to look for the 60 minute... :(  Nice copper amber colour with a perfect two-finger, dense white and creamy head. Nice lacing on the glass. I haven't seen many IPAs that look better.  Nice mixture of smells: English malts, loads of hops, fruit aromas, slight grassiness.  Lovely, well balanced taste. High on the hops and thus delivers good fruity and grassy flavours that border on the bitter side. The English malts mellow this out. One of the best Double/Imperial IPAs I've tasted. Very hoppy, but the hops are mellowed out by the malts. No alcohol present.  Mouthfeel is great. Maybe a tad bit light on the carbonation, but good drinking. Drinkability is hampered somewhat by the alcohol. Its not present in the taste, but be careful, because you can certainly feel it.  Two notes: My bottle is labelled as ""90 Minute Imperial IPA,"" and thus is probably the new labelling. Also, mine has the bottled on date...a very faint 02/01/06...so February 1 2006 or January 2 2006.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

All of this combonation in incredible balance. This is a damn good beer.  M - Light, and smooth on palate.  D - For 9.0%, I could drink these all day long. However with the price tag on these, that's not possible.  The North Eastern DIPA to set the bar. 90 Minute is just that good. It has a lot more maltyness to it, than the 60 minute version. Yet, they are almost near each other on raw hoppiness. 90 Minute is still slighly more hoppy, but it's the malt that creates that metaphoric sense of being dulled down. Highly recommended.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,rtratzlaff,4.97,"NOTE: This is a reveiw of a Randallized version of this beer.  Not much head on this slightly hazy deep amber beer (probably due to the fact that it's been poured into a pitcher first). Fresh hops, florals, citrus, and sweet malt in the nose. The taste is superb. Hands down, the most enjoyable beer I have had to date. Not as much of a bite as the bottled version, the Randall smooths it out considerably. Taste is of sweet cake, fruit, pine-like hops. The oily hops coat the tongue. I love the balance between the hops and the thick malt. A Creamy smooth mouthfeel, unlike anything else.

A true beer drinker's beer... in moderation of course.  I bought this as a 12 oz longneck, as they are now sold. Everything about this beer is great, but most notably its smoothness and perfect interpretation of this style, as a Double IPA.  It pours a nice amber color with a perfect head that maintains its presence. It's smooth taste is characterized by a perfect blend of hops and a great mouthfeel.

Great clarity. Good initial head and retention. Slight lacing.  S: Strong notes of caramel malt and hops. Fruity (grapefruit?), floral, and spicy all at the same time.  T: Same as smell. Perfectly balanced. Strong malt backbone strongly complimented by fruity and bitter hops.  M: Mouthfeel was perfect. Not thin and not heavy.  D: Drinkability would be outstanding if two of these at 9% abv didn't put on my arse.  Overall, one of the best beers I've ever had. I will definitely reccommend this to others and I WILL have more.

10099,2093,akahn,4.2,"Pours an elegant rosy amber. Lots of lethargic bubbles floating up to the surface, and a big bubbled frothy ring around the surface.  Fruity, sweet aroma. Not super-hoppy like I expected. Alcohol in the nose too, and what hops I pick up are bright, floral.  Very full flavor  big malt sweetness initially, which gives way to a big flash under the swallow of hops and alcohol. Everything here compliments everything else  the hops are floral and somewhat sweet, so they play off the malt, yet the bitterness interacts with the alcohol. Despite significant sweetness, drying in the finish, resinous.  Rich, full body lightened by understated carbonation. Really impressively drinkable, albeit at a slow pace, for a 9% beer. This beer is so far from what I was expecting, it's crazy. I was expecting bracing hop bitterness. To me, this beer is quite sweet! That works too.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Lupin,4.85,"I cracked this bottle over a thin crust olive/mushroom pie and instantly noted the odors of sweet fruit. Actually, it reminds me of cotton candy. Obviously it's hoppy.  Head is friendly, and the beer would almost resemble freshly poured iced tea if the head didn't retain about 5mm of wispy bubbles. Bright, shiny, clear orange. Slight carbonation merrily works its way to the top of the highball glass.  Taste is less overwhelming than the first few times I drank this beer. I used to be bothered by the hoppiness, but after having red ales like cascazilla, I've changed my mind. After warming to hoppier beers in general, I've come to realize the brilliance of a properly made IPA. Yeah, the hops are there, and there is a little bit of bitterness, but the thin sweetness balances it so well. You can sip it over the middle of your tongue and just enjoy what almost tastes like a nutty fruit juice, or you can swirl it around for its true character, a dry, bittersweet explosion that you can practically taste on the inside of your cheeks. A tiny hint of nut, raisin, and orange round out the body.  Every time I drink this beer, I like it a little bit more. It tastes exactly like it tastes, delicious, refreshing and exciting.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I was in love after that, amazing balance of grainy malts, sugray fruit undertones, piney hops and a nice warm alchohol tingle. I love everything about this beer. A light golden honey color gives way to a almost perfectly white head. The retention is decent but he lacing is phenomenal. The taste out-of-this-world.

Brutal initial hopping but mellows in the sip to finish reasonably clean. Satisfying, tasty finish with fruit tones without. Alcohol is clearly present but not overwhelming.

Flavor is very complex with dark, dried fruits, some spice, a bit of alcohol. The bitterness isn't overly pronounced, mostly just the flavors of the hops come out. Mouthfeel is slick and creamy feeling backed by a moderate amount of carbonation. I'm a bit surprised by this brew as it doesn't match any others of this style. It's not overly citrusy, bitter, or sweet. It's closer to a Belgian style for me than a DIPA. Overall, however, I'm happy with the one bottle I got.

The smell was one of hops, very floral, accompanied by a slight malt and fruit cent.  The taste was great, a strong hoppy flavor balanced with a sweetish malt flavor and a fairly strong citrus flavor. Almost an overall sweet flavor with big hops. The mouthfeel was good, with good carbonization.  Over all this is a great beer if you are looking for a double IPA, wish it was more readily available on the west coast.

Brown sugar aroma, definately some hops there but not as much as I was expecting.  Pretty sweet taste to start, finishes with a nice hoppiness, very balanced for an IPA with so much hops.  Heavy mouthfeel coming in at 9% ABV. You can certainly taste the alcohol but it is not overpowering.  This beer was different than I expected, I was expecting a more assertive hop bite but it was actually much more smooth bordering on sweet. Much more well balanced than other ""big"" IPA's, not sure if I like that about this IPA or not yet, maybe I need another, oh well. Looking forward to trying the 120 Min IPA in the near future.

10099,2093,beertastegood,4.57,"12oz, bottled a little less than 4 months ago.  Pours a brilliantly clear copper with a voluminous, fluffy off-white head. Aromas of citrus, floral and herbal hops (think grapefruit and pine resin) with a very prominent caramel, toffee and brown-sugar maltiness underneath. Through it all comes the alcohol, just barely there, reminding you that this is a beer to be reckoned with.  Taste: Sweet candied fruit up front, followed by a hoppy burst of citrus and floral tones. There is much more than simple bitterness, although there is a noticeable bitterness to this beer. The hop flavor simply shines through in the mid-taste. Towards the end the sweet malt backbone comes back in along with a slight warming alcohol taste. Extremely balanced in the finish, with both malt and hops playing a symphony of flavor on your taste buds. Simply put, the most balanced IIPA I have ever had. Not that IIPAs necessarily should be balanced, but I really enjoyed the way neither hops nor malt dominated.  Mouthfeel: Silky smooth, full body; medium carbonation.  Drinkability: This beer sneaks up on you - it is as close to a sessionable beer as a 9 percenter will ever be.  Had this a few times before, finally decided to review it.

This is the first beer in my craft brewing advetures where I let out a proverbial Eureka and realized what the craft beer thing was all about. I don't know if this is really true to the double IPA style, because it has a balance that most of the double IPAs don't have. Instead of having hops to ""rip your tongue out"" it has hops that finish well and balance off the thick malty opening on this beer. Get a sweet citris overall taste which is really balanced and almost always hits the spot. Fairly prominent alcohol taste which works well in the confines of this.

I've recently gone from drinking Brown ales to IPA's. The mouth feel is oily (but in a good way) from all the hops and is very thick.

Great hop flavor with a bitterness that doesn't linger. Hits the extremities of what a DIPA should and can be. A full malty body. Almost slick, but the maltiness provides great traction andf the flavor grabs the whole palate. One of the best DIPA's I've had.... Different however in it's own way. Great Drinkability! \thanks to Lackenhauser for this one (not to mention many others).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,HellsBELLS24,4.88,Unbelieveable.  Floral and citrus aroma with a mahogony pour. This double IPA is one of the best. Not as hoppy as the 60 min IPA but much smoother. Much more malt used in this brew. Easy drinkability and you feel great after 2 of them!! Very smooth with an excellent finish. would love to find it on tap somewhere with the DFH fresh hopper!!,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,scruffwhor,4.47,"Appearance- Pours a mix of sunlight and mahagony. The head is a spongey off-white with all right retention. No film or foam ring is left at about the half way point. No lacing.  Smell- A sugary hop smell. Is that possible?? Its liek citrus, floral, and bitterness married with cane sugar in the nose of this beer.  Taste- Starts with a molasses like sweet punch of cascade hops and amber malts. This slowly decends to a more Belgian Candi sugar taste with a well developed malt character. This is why I love DFH.  Mouthfeel- The perfect flavor example of the word ""bittersweet"". Enough said.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Celt44,4,"Appearance is that of a light amber with a head that disipates quickly but lacing lasts throughout. Aroma is citrus with strong hints of grapefruit and malt. Slight alcohol nose present but is masked well. Malt character is stronger than any other Double IPA I've ever had - the hops are present but overwhelmed by the strong maltiness. Mouthfeel is smooth for ABV. My lips stick together from the sweetness. Overall a good Double IPA - Not my favorite. I enjoy the 60 Minute IPA much better - but I favor single IPAs anyway. Not my first choice for a 2IPA, but good.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

You can't get it here in Ontario, although supposedly the 60 Minute is now available at the LCBO (yet to see it, though!). I'm reviewing my last bottle of the 90 Minute...  Pours a semi-clear, orangey amber into a pint glass. Small head, but I like this beer a little colder than some, so that's probably why.  Aroma is powerful citrus -- lemons, oranges, grapefruit.  Taste is... for me, anyway... perfect! Nice and hoppy, dry but still well balanced with malt. Orange and citrus, pine and earthiness, but none of the soapiness of some other strong IPAs.  Mouthfeel is great -- smooth and coating without being slick or oily. Great, sweetish aftertaste provides some 'relief' from the citrusy bitterness (not that it's needed).  By far the best IPA or double IPA I've had.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

S: Strong floral / hop smell raises out of the glass and meets your nose half way to your mouth. Definite citrus nose. Maybe a bit of pine?  T: The hops are definitely there, but not as strong as I had hoped. The bitterness is there but it is balanced by the alcohol. Not nearly as strong alcohol as you would expect for the ABV. Gets a little stronger as the beer warms.  M: Creamy feel that coats your whole mouth and lips. Hops stay on the roof of your mouth. Coating feeling keeps the aftertaste with you for a while and you are happy about that.  D: Overall very drinkable. Hops could be a little more agressive. Goes down a little too easily for the ABV so be careful! This one drinks like a good session beer, but at 9% it'll sneak up on you.

Did a harder pour on the second one, got the same amount of head. Floral smell, sweet taste, extremely smooth almost creamy going down. You really dont want the aftertaste to end.

I could sit with this stuffed in my face all day. Citrusy hops dominate the taste, but I'm surprised at how balanced this is. I don't feel like the bitterness is out of control which I feared could be the case with this style, especially in the finish. Better than I expected, and I was expecting a lot.

I was swimming through layers of herbal, piney, floral hop aromas and flavors with an amazingly balanced sweet malt backbone that had me silenced, but for the sound of purring deep within my bowels. Layer upon layer of hop flavor washing over every millimeter of my mouth. Nothing sharp or harsh about so much hop flavor.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,fizzyfred,4.72,"First off, I can't believe how balanced this beer is, I couldn't have been happier. Its a deep golden color, slightly hazy with little head and a nice lace. There is definitely a strong grain bill backing the monster hop addition, which it does nicely. The alcohol flavor also provides balance without it being too ""boozy"". The hop flavor is strong but isn't too bitter nor is it grassy or piney. This is definitely a standard for the style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,cooter,4.66,"[Note: this review will be knowledge-less; ie, I know nothing about the style, have never had it before, etc...I am a 90-minute virgin. That sounds weird.]  Absolutely beautiful lacing, just from the head dying. Interestingly, it has a rather plain, carbonation-light body, with a yellow-orange color. Foam is frothy and clumpy and sticky and egg-white in color.  The reason I reviewed this beer is because of its smell. Right hand to god, it demanded that I explicate its goodness. I made sounds smelling it that make my girlfriend jealous. Melon, light pine, a slight grassiness and moss are readily noticable, and with a swirl, so is a powerful alcohol, more melon, and some strawberry.  It feels like silk in my mouth. Carbonation is strong but not powerful--it's smooth and peppy but without overdue intensity. Aftertaste is without stickiness, leaving my mouth watering. Light but full-bodied. Agile, even. Warms my belly and droops my eyes.  It's surprisingly light on flavor, too, until one takes a good swallow. It's drinkable more than anything of this caliber (and hop content!) I've ever tried. When the flavor comes through, though, it makes itself known with smooth raspberry, pine, grapefruit, and lemon in such a way that doesn't surprise or knock me back. Not what I was expecting, but certainly wonderful and excellent. The ""Imperial IPA"" made me expect a powerhouse, with rough edges, sharp tastes, and a sumo wrestler's body. Instead, it's a smooth, Belgian-like dilettante. What a sexy beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Looking into the glass was reminiscent of looking down on Earth from space, through the clouds. Leaves lacing in the shape of veins, or lightning bolts down alongside the glass. An otherwise (average, but attractive) golden appearence. Aroma seems a little restrained, or compared to expectations anyhow. A unique blend of hops in this beer. I struggle to confidently detect one single kind. Mouthfeel is medium-low carbonated which suits the beer quite well. Not one swig is empty, flavour consistent in each and at the varying temperatures. While there is no alcohol 'burn', no alcohol taste in any form really, mouthfeel still acompanied with a warming sensation. You can feel the warming sensation (I must stress, no alcohol taste) in the sides of the mouth. Hops are rather restrained in the flavour, a big malty back bone sees to it. Some crisp bitterness right before swallowing. Flavour is above anything else cistruisy. Some grapefuity notes, but overall I seem to taste tangerine. As it warms flavour improves. Hops come alive a little more as the malt settles into the background. Quite deliscious.

Aroma is fruity and floral much like the 60 min, just a little juicier.  Flavor is sweet at first followed by some pine and citrus with a little bit of spice.  Finish is long and piney, a little heat from the alcohol burns the back of the throat and warms the belly.  Pricey beer, for just a little more than what I paid for this, Id rather have a bomber of Ruination.

The nose was not overwhelming, but had a nice hoppy/malty aroma. The mouthfeel was excellent, smooth and buttery. You could just let it sit there if you wanted, but people might look at you strangely. Hops stay strong throughout, and there is a nice blend between the hops and malt. Nothing too overpowering. A bit of sweetness towards the end, but it does not linger in your mouth too long. This is 9% alchohol, but you could not really tell, which can be course dangerous.

Smells of nice citrusy/orangey hops with some pine in there as well. Also some fairly strong hints of alcohol in there. This bottle seems different than other 90 Minutes I've had in the past, not as much of a malty backbone.  Taste is similar to the smell. Very orangey and some piney hops. Not as bready as I remember. The alcohol is somewhat noticable, but not as much as in the smell.  Medium to full bodied, and a smooth creamy mouthfeel. Also somewhat oily, but not bad.  Pretty good drinkability for a 9% beer, I could see myself having a few of these. Although the 90 Minutes that I've had in the past seem a little bit different than this one. They were more malty with a bland bitterness to them. This must be a freasher bottle as the hops were more flavorful.

The initial impression from this beer was that I was drinking it while I was cooking beer on the stove. The ingredients just ooze all over the place. A lot of stuff went into this beer.  This is a pricey one - in NE Ohio I paid $9.99 for 4 - but it is interesting and different - I'd buy it again (how did that other person get a single for $1.39??). The bottles I got were a little dusty, but no more than a couple months old. I also have a 60 minute to try today as well and I hope it is as interesting as this.  I have also had this on tap (in Bellevue, Washington). I had alrady been thoroughly blown away by a mess of Rock Bottom stuff. Of course a 90 put me over the top.

Smells pretty good, real floral hoppy and then sweet malts. It wants to just overwhelm you with the hops, then the malts come up and say ""uh uh"".  I thought the taste was a let down. Way too sweet for me. Real nice piney hops, but not ""bitter"". Just generic malt sweetness. Sickly Jolly Rancher flavor too. Booze gets strong as it warms up.  Nothing wrong with the mouth feel, very smooth actually because there's very little carbonation.  No way I'd drink more than one of these at a time, too much booze, too sweet.

S-Smells like pine and alcohol fumes. T-Pine then fruit juice (maybe apricot) then grass/evergreen then finishes with alcohol and syrupy sweetness combined....you know, I was expecting a hop bomb, as anything that's hopped continuously for 90 minutes should be really hoppy, right? Right? Hmmm...., or maybe it's really hoppy with hops that don't depart a bitter, citric twang...this does have a bitterness, of course, but it's of the kind that I can sleep through. It says on the label that it is balanced by a ""ridiculous amout of 2- row barley"", I think the malts are undetectable except in the taste of sweetness. The hops balance this sweetness, I suppose, but they are really not giving the hop presence I expect out of an IMPERIAL IPA. Instead of hop burps, I get alcohol burps, go figure...Medicinal aftertaste isn't that great either, IMHO. M-I have to say, the mouthfeel in this beer is superb, I would classify it as medium/full, and didn't expect it to be so thick. Unseen, microscopic carbonation aids in this, i think. D-One is plenty for me. Too alchoholic/syrup-sweet for me, or maybe there's too many Stone Ruinations under the bridge...I'm pretty disappointed, but glad I tried it though.

As evolved and formidable as any double IPA I've ever had, the 90 Minute is a beautiful and delicious beer from start to finish. It's that perfect blend of hops and alcohol that the 60 Minute just doesn't capture and the 120 Minute goes a bit overboard with. At present, this is my favorite beer in the world.

Really just outstanding. Taste is just to die for. A smooth yet lively ride witha somewhat oily feel, the 90 minute delivers the kind of hop attack you'd expect from a DIPA, a great bittersweet ride that ebbs and flows from chewy and bitter to sweet and warm and back to a bitter all over again. Hints of citris and pine find its way into it here and there, and, if I were a witch doctor, I'd say this is an excellent cure for a headache, as mine mysteriously disappeared.

Superb balance, the hops and the malt blend to produce a delicious flavor. Bitterness is actually pretty low, especially compared to what I expected. The aftertaste is fantastic.  M- Full and somewhat syrupy, and smooth as silk.  D- Incredible. I'd say I could drink this stuff all night, but of course I physically couldn't. That might not stop me from trying, though...

10099,2093,edmundfitzoil,4.1,"Dogfish Head's 90 Minute IPA poured from a brown, 12 oz. bottle with a bottled on date listed as 02/01/06. I poured mine into a tulip glass.  Poured a dark gold color with a finger of bright white head that dissipated and left a ring of white head around the edge of the glass. Little bubbles of what looked like an energetic dose of carbonation rose throughout the drinking of the beer to the top of the glass, and the head left some ultra fine lacing around the top of the initial pour. The aroma was of citrussy hops with a little caramel and healthy dose of piney aromas. The beer had a suprisingly creamy textures and medium to full mouthfeel and a dry, tickling carbonated finish, an experience to have on the tongue. A big hoppy presence begins the beer and then that transitions slowly to a healthy maltiness. I expected the hoppiness to be slightly more agressive than what it proved to be, but because of this fact, this one is enormously drinkable and pleasantly refreshing.  Notes: This style has been growing on me enormously of late. I find myself returning the beers because of their promise of enormouse hops and flavor. This is one solid double IPA that I would definitely return to again, although it does not instill in me the instant satisfaction that I have perhaps tried the best example of the style, I hope to find it on tap and give it another go.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,geexploitation,4.25,"First time reviewing this classic. This bottle pours with a smaller head than I remember DFH 90 having, and a nice, clear, bright amber body. The nose is quite piney due to all the hops, but the nose indicates balance, too, with some solid malts in the background. The taste is quite bitter with fruity, piney hops, moving from the front of the palate to the back. Throughout this beer is big and full on the palate -- very high gravity -- and incredibly smooth given all the hops present. For an extremely hoppy, highly alcoholic brew, DFH 90 is surprisingly drinkable. This is a truly excellent IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Immediately reminded me of Dreadnaught.  One finger head makes its presence known. Pretty transparent light, burnt orange. Pretty good flurry of bubble action.  Reminds me a lot of dreadnaught. Its got that pineapple/strawberry hop character. Is this an east coast IPA thing? Ive never had a west coast IPA taste like this before. Slightly less complex than Dready. Piney hop punch up front, rolling in to that aforementioned fruity hoppiness. Alcohol is very well masked, and only noticeable as a slight burn in my tummy.

My brother, cousin, buddy Ray and I won a Randall at the 1st Annual DFH bocce tournament and we tried it out on a keg of 90 minute at a party I had in 2005. What an experience. We were lucky enough to have the fine folks at the DFH brewpub in Rehoboth (Mike the brewer) fill our Randall with cascade hops. We poured the beers straight from the tap into pitchers as the beer was very foamy and needed some time to settle. The aroma of this ranallized 90 minute in the pitcher and in the glasses when we later poured it was of a great big bunch of piney hops bursting at the seams, even more than usual. The taste was very pleasing with more bold piney hop bit with a touch of grapefruit and other citrus. I could not get over the great aroma of this bad bad boy. Although we lost a bit of the keg in hooking up the system, what we had we really enjoyed.  We even filled a growler near the end and took some of the cascade hops from the Randall and put in the growler. This made for an even bigger hop experience the following day.  I look forward to trying 90 minute again or maybe something different on our Randall in the future. Great job Sam!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Smell: I was expecting the hops to be too big. This beer may have gotten bigger than the 60 min but it did not get overly bitey. The smell is actually more toasted sweet malt that it is over the top pine bite. After the caramel lead off there is a bold grapefruit presence but not cloying. (coming from a non-hophead). I is very fruity like some apple and white grape were thrown in this floral bouquet.  Taste & Mouthfeel: Sweet. Smooth! Alcohol and balanced hop spice then dry finish and grapefruit aftertaste with a second wave of sugars following the tart. The moment this beer touched my lips it was instant onslaught of marvelous sugars and tingles. It is so magnificently smooth and slick it just slid across my tougher with its oily malty slickness and unless I stopped to swish it around the bitter was only presented as a mild tingle. When I held on to it for further contemplation the alcohol did show through but in nice balance with the citrus rind tartness. The aftertaste left me with a grapefruit pucker followed by more sugars coming back around for a second wave of sweetness. Brilliant!  Drinkability: This is a very drinkable beer. At 9% ABV it has caught up to you before you know it. I would consider it easy to drink but not sessionable.  Hope this is helpful.

10099,2093,KyleVick4,4.04,"12 oz bottle  A: Looks all right, clear copperish color with a small head that dies fast.  S: Smells wonderful with floral hops galore. Mmmm Also some piney hops and a touch of alcohol  T: A glorified IPA. Does leave a sharp alcohol taste after which is really the only detraction. Other than that it is very hoppy with a touch of toastiness? toffee? The malt is present too and it is not just a system overload of hops.  M: To carbonated. A sharpness of carbonation hits you in conjunction with the alcohol. Plus the 9% really adds to an unpleasant syrupy mouthfeel.  D: The high carbonation with the syrupy mouthfeel should have me slowly sipping the beverage. But nonetheless the amazing taste of hops and malts have me drinking it quite fast. Dont think I would go for another one, but thats not the goal of this type of style now is it?  D: Its strong, its heavy, but I still gave it a 3.5 because of",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,nmyers,5,If you like hops this is the way to go. The boys at Dogfish head have made a great beer here. If you love hops this beer is for you. Personally the best IPA I have had. This beer has a great hop taste. I am really looking forward to trying the 120 min IPA from Dogfish Head.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,TheSarge,4.23,"Here's a beer that pushes the limits. 90 Minute IPA is 9% ABV and the nearly 300 calories per bottle. I must say that Im impressed with Mr. Sam Calagione. He brews this magnificent stuff, but obviously remains in good physically fit shape. I think my wife has a crush on him (via the brewing video put out by the History Channel, which I watch 4 times a week on average). Whats with Mr. Calagiones naming convention? Anyhow, lets get on with the show.  I poured 90 Minute IPA from a 12 oz bottle into my pint glass. The brew is quite clear, not hazy at all. Has a beautiful amber color, with a fine bubbly head leaving behind a fine lacy film within two minutes.  I can smell the roasted malts in this. The hops don't blind the malt too much. None the less, the prominent leafy/flowery smell is most prevalent. I detect the slightly higher alcohol content here too.  I can taste the sweetness from the malt, SURPRISE! The hops still don't overpower the malt. This is also a little biscuity and fruity too.  The brew feels a little dry, but not too much. I can feel the alcohol presence especially in the back of my throat.  90 minutes later This is a great specimen. Be careful of the extra calorie content, or you'll get fat from this stuff. Also, 1 90 Minute IPA is equal to two regular macro beers in ABV. Take it easy.  TheSarge",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,jwc215,4.15,"One month after bottling date:  Pours reddish amber with a white head that thins, but has great lasting power. Some lacing sticks.  The smell is of mango, apricot, citrus and pine. Some caramel and a whiff of alcohol blend in.  The taste is sweeter than it is bitter...quite a bit. Caramel and tropical fruits/resin, in an oily way, mix together. A bit soapy. Finishes with a juicy, slightly boozy, fruitiness.  Medium-to-full bodied, a bit oily.  Hops come across as juicy/oily more than bitter. An interesting DIPA that I enjoy smelling a bit more than drinking (though I enjoy that too!)",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,NolanGTI,4.85,"Probably my favorite, or close to it, DIPA out there. Pours with a nice head off slight tan on top of a dark orange sea of wonderful hopiness. The head lacing is as high on this beer as any I have ever tasted, consistently coats the glass all the way to the last drop.  Nose is enormous with a robust pine cone and citrus combo that plays delicately while also being very bold. Taste is balanced. Pure hoppy goodness with a nice malt structure as a backbone. This beer almost defines the style for me with its easy drinking but very complex blend of hops, malt and underlying citrus notes.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Liquids,4.7,"Pours a slightly syrupy orange hue with a one finger steady head and full streaming carbonation. Smells so hoppy but not in an intimidating way. Sweet and citrusy, piney for sure, nothing else smells like this beer. Taste on this pour is insane hops which hit you upfront actually, and then the malt pulls through later...rather backwards here! The sensation is not unlike drinking some kind of acid! Insanely hoppy, and yet it doesn't hurt. None of that awful taste left on the palate, and every sip makes you want another soon. I remember thinking this was even more malty than it is, but it is indeed extemely malty, hence the unsusual hue, and ability to hold up to these hops! I imagine this must be a blend of multiple hop varities, as this much of one hop would be like an icepick...but the complexity of hops here is just so precice, and so intense, it must have been a very time consuming recipe to produce such perfection that achieves both extremity and balance... Mouthfeel is very full and thick, carbonation is hard but nothing could dominate the thickness of the malt or intensity of the hops here, so it somehow it comes off almost balanced? This beer defies the style, which screams ""one sided!""  This is the only double IPA i can really drink (so far). I made the mistake of making this the first IPA I tried. It got me excited about beer, hops, and IPA's, but I've not yet found another nearly as amazing. Little praise can be said about this beer that is not infact true. Of note, as high as this beers rating is for me, I never stock it and drink it only on extremely rare occasions, by itself, and stich to the likewise delicious 60 on occasion with food, which may account for how impressed I am by this brew on those rare occasions I crack one. Cheers to possibly my favorite craft brewery!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,nflmvp,4.5,"Poured our copper/amber into a large tulip. Admittedly, I was very agressive on the pour and this gave me more than a 4 finger head. I poured this nearly 5 mnutes ago and there's still more than a three finger head with a serious cottony lacing on the glass. Smell is very citrusy and hoppy. Taste is similar with plenty of hop, lemon zest and alcohol but nothing at all overpowering. Mouth feel is full, coating and slightly thick. Not at all syrupy.  This is VERY drinkable. It's smooth and warming and each sip makes your mouth water for more.  I see this as being a seriously dangerous summer beer. The funny thing is that I've never considered myself a hop head but apparently my taste is still developing.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Ohhhh yeah, nice citrusy hop flavor with sweet malt, a perfect balance. Damn I could pound these things all night but I must control myself and savor them instead. Only if they were available in six packs and not just 4-packs.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,lordofthewiens,3.97,"Is this the big brother of 60' IPA? If so, I need to have the 120'. It looks like the 60', clear orange with a medium white head. It has a sweet odor, and a similar taste, but deeper and bolder. It's very hoppy, but I think a bit smoother and not as sharp as the 60'.. A wonderful beer, one I would like to have again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,hermesch,4.35,"Found this beer by accident...happy accident.   Pours with minimum foam, maximum aroma. Few bubbles atop this clear, copper brew, and hops are merely a compliment to the richer, maltier promise that is soon delivered.   Much to be discovered in the taste: hops are pungent and find the back of your sinuses quickly, but are backed by a tasty male sweetness. Alcohol is apparent and at 9% ABV needs to be acknoweldged. This is not a beer to begin your night, but rather to cap it off.  Pairs well with sharp cheddar, like a Grafton's 5 year.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Delicious hops nose with no citrus noted. The first impression is a thick, substantial mouth, nearly syrupy yet still liquid and refreshing. Flavor is complex; hops are subtle yet certainly present with no real bitterness. Theres the slightest hint of alcohol, which at 9% ABV isnt surprising. Finish is again well balanced, with subdued hops and a light bitterness; finish is lightly syrupy. Drinkability is very good; it is an enjoyable IPA that is not overly hopped or bitter.  Overall: An outstanding IPA, wholeheartedly recommended.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,HugoGrim,4.6,"Purchased in a four pack for what I'd normally pay for a sixer, but since I've heard such good things about this brew I didn't mind the extra cost.  Poured from the bottle into a standard pint. Body is a fairly clear, crisp looking copper brown. A tad lighter in shade than a lot of craft IPAs. Decent head exited quite quickly. Some lace.  The aroma doesn't kick like I expected, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Roasted malts dominate, and hops are there, but don't kick your teeth in, which was a surprise. Sweet caramels, faint flowers, and grain.  The flavor is where this brew shines... big time. The label states it is ""balanced by a ridiculous amount of English Two-row barley"" which is no joke. Simply beautiful. The hop profile is complex and also perfectly balanced. I like to be assaulted by hops as much as the next guy, but that's not what this beer is going for. Rich and flavorful, the hops hold their own, but in no way overshadow the entire flavor like a lot of others in the style. Hands down the best DIPA I've had to date.  9% You wouldn't guess it. Watch your back on this one, or you'll be laying on it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,mcallister,4.65,"Pours a dirty brown with thick lacing and a quick to dissipate head.  Nose was actually not as hoppy smelling as I had hoped for. Still a very bold piney, hoppy aroma.  Well the taste of this brew is truly spectacular. Hop heads rejoice there may be a god. The Randall system does seem to add mucho hop and more character to the brew but I wonder how often they have to add new hops and take out the old? Oh yeah back to the taste. Slight grapefruit with other citrusy notes shining through, pine needle, a significant amount of tannin but that's due to the spectacular hop texture.  Extremely long finish of pure hop, pine, and tannin. This beer is extremely drinkable. Almost too much so. Hopefully my local bar (Boston's Bistro) will have a go at Randall The Enamel Animal.  Would have loved to try a draught 120 minute with this. Would have also been interesting to do a side by side of a regular Draught 90 min and the Randall 90 min.  Conclusion, if you know of a place that's not over a 2 hour drive from your homestead (unless you get a hotel) stop and try this unique concept in beer history. Well worth it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,elmocoso,4.37,"Poured from the bottle to a good head. Underneath, a deep solid gold with active, widespread beading. Lacing is good.  Smell is solid hops, crisp and citrusy, emphasise on grapefruit. Behind it lays a mountain of malt.  The taste is like a brick. No subtly here, It is a huge beer with huge flavors. Rich malt and mouth-puckering hops.  Mouth-feel is sweet, sweet gravy. Bring a spoon for this beer.  Drinkability only suffers from the size of this one. Although i would drink quite a few in a row, i wouldn't call it a session beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,JiminKY,4.55,"I had this on tap, run through the ""Randall the Enamel Animal"" fresh hop infuser at Buffalo Wild Wings in Indianapolis, duing NCAA Final Four weekend. WOW! What a difference the fresh hop infusion made. This was a totally different beer than what I'd tasted in bottles of 90 Minute. And as a bonus, since the hop machine caused the pour to be ""foamy,"" the bartender poured it into a pitcher and gave me the extra in addition to the glassful--it wound up being a 2 for 1 special! Let me just say that 20 oz of fresh-hop infused 90 Minute was a great way to start the weekend.  A - A lovely dark pinkish gold with a beautiful 1"" head (after being pitchered and then poured into the glass).  S - It had just flowed through lines of fresh hops on it's way to the spout--the smell was heavenly for a hophead.  T - As always, this is where it is all at. While I find bottled 90 Minute a bit heavy on the alcohol, this draft incarnation had a fresher, more well-balanced taste profile.  M - The slightly higher carbonation level--compared to the bottled version--gave it a cleaner, less oily, mouthfeel, which I quite enjoyed.  D - Unreal. Perhaps the most dangerous drinkability of any high alcohol content beer I've ever had (with Bigfoot being a possible exception). If I did not know this was a 9% beer, I might have downed these all afternoon, until I fell off my stool in a coma.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Taste - just as promised by aroma - pine and alchohol and, most unfortuantely diacetyl. The various elements just did not integrate. Diacetyl makes it way too sweet, and the alcohol goes down like cheap vodka. Mouthfeel - full, moderate carbonation, alcohol burn, decent coating from hop oil. Drinkabilty - I did not like this and will avoid it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,assurbanipaul,4.32,"Pours a bright amber, darker than the 60 Minute but not too dark, clear with a thin head. Aroma is bright and floral, dry herbal hops, a little sweeter than dry hops, juicy, a little more malt, a slight alcoholic presence.  Taste is rich and floral hops, pale malt, bitter and quite untraditional in the style of IPAs. Slightly sweet, citrusy, earthy, light body, good balance with a dry finish. Characteristic herbally DFH flavor profile.  Medium mouthfeel, moderately drinkable with an oily nature and a slight bitter sting on the tongue along with the aftertaste. A very unique taste that would place it more as a light barleywine than a strong IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Frozensoul327,4.48,"Really looked forward to this one, now time to try it and review it. Pours out to a rich golden amber color with a lively head of whitish orange foam. Solid lacing and a medium to medium low level of carbonation. Aromas of hops, hops and more hops. Very nice. Notes of citrus, pine, hops, a touch of sweet spices and herbs. Taste was pure hops. Flavors were laced with thick citrus and pine notes, drenched with hops and a mild burn of alcohol. Nice. This is a hop heads dream come true. Mouthfeel was nice and oily, just the way a good DIPA should be. Very slick, and slightly thick. Drinkability is good. I wouldn't have more than one at a time, but this is a solid beer.

I dream about this smell. A perfect balance of sweet citrus hops and malts. The smell is a very inviting sweet and bitter smell.  The taste is a very solidly balanced combination or citrusy hops and malty sweetness. A light effervesence from the carbonation, which makes it feel like the flavor literally dances a cross your tounge and down your throat. The mouhfeel is a thick, but without being syrupy. The finish is a long decrescendo of cirtus hops and malts. The taste ever so slowly fades from your palette in a way that makes you want more.  Overall, I love this beer. It's hoppy without being overpowering sweet without being cloying and thick without being syrupy. It feels very decadent, but is still a solidly crafted and tasteful beer. I dream about this beer.

Lots of hop oily goodness. The mouthfeel is nice, really slick and smooth. It coats your mouth similar to brooklyn east ipa. This is so drinkable! The alcohol is not tasteable.

10099,2093,Gagnonsux,4.5,"90 Minute is a dark copper color with lost of carbonation. Large head is creamy and thick. Aroma is of a strong, pungent citrissy hop with an enticing underlying sweetness. For flavor the strong, fresh citrissy hop flavors are first noticed and pack quite a wallop, but the delicious underlying malt flavors are what makes this an exemplorary beer. Bitterness is high, but not as bracing as expected. Anyway, 90 Minute is one of the best beers that I've sampled in a while, there's just so much juicy hop flavor to enjoy here and an excellent malt base. Complexity is high and the flavors have many interesting nuances. Very highly recommended.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Illinick,4.39,"A: Copper in color with bronze and slight orange hues. Little to no head that quickly becomes a ring. Superb lacing, but I expected nothing less. S: Incredibly aromatic. Great scents of citrus, rind and pine with slight floral and fruity sweetness. Some bread flavors as well as medicinal scents. Just smells plain fresh. T: Wow! Tons of malt and hops! Let's start with the hoppy side. Citrus, rind, and piney hop flavors. Definate oily hop flavors that are offset with a malty sweetness. I didn't expect the malt to be this sweet, but it definately was. Malty, sweet bread with slight roasted and caramel flavors. Couldn't decide if the big hops were fighting with the malty sweetness or if they were working together to provide my senses with a balanced, hugely flavored brew. Alcohol warmth present at the end, but only slightly. MF: Chewy and finishes semi-dry. Overall: A fantastic brew that will impress beer lovers everywhere.

Aroma is mostly hoppy, floral, and piney. Taste blows me away. Hops are noticed first, then a sweet malt flavor follows, alcohol bites just a bit at the finish. Light carbonation with a medium-thick mouthfeel. Much more balanced then what I was expecting.

I poured it into a narrpw pilsener glass for some odd reason, but that let me see its copper body with golden highlights, under a bubbly head. The taste is sticky; any sweeter and itd be beer candy. Then I noticed the nice American IPA hop bill sliding in nice and gently, until it demonstrates its every bit the match of the oversized malt profile. Total impression is of a hoppy young barleywine. I hadnt realized this was an Imperial IPA. Ill have to see if I can celler my remaining bottles.

I liked it for it's 9% and great overall appeal... with a few hindrances aside I'll definitely order it again.  Not that it matters, but the bottle is great in that it comically hints at the explosive taste and experience it is to drink this Dogfish. It pours a beautiful dark amber color, somewhat like a strongly brewed iced tea. The cream colored head rises and fades away into a lace on the glass. It's scent is a lot like a fig's, very hopsy (obviously). Here it comes, the first swig bombards you with the taste. Very balanced indeed, with the citrus flavors predominating initially, followed by strong alcoholic bite, but not overwhelming. The aftertaste disappears quickly, which is good, for a bite of such potency would not be enjoyable over long periods, just in shots. So much fun... The entire glass drank very easily, and to be perfectly honest left me a little tipsy. I know, I'm a lightweight.

This beer's defining characteristic is its balance--the flavor is the perfect match of initial bitterness with a malt backing that makes it feel smooth and easy to enjoy (in some ways, it's this malty backing that I've always found lacking in the DH 60 Minute).  In addition to the understated bitterness, the flavor is a solid mix of caramel, cinnamon, citrus, and a subtle yet defined alcohol presence.  The balance makes this taste deceptively drinkable--way too easy to take down for its ABV. Overall, this is a mild, and nicely flavored double IPA. Definitely worth a look.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I picture DFH as one of those ""Old School"" companies that just gets back to basics in everything they do. And they listen to what we want as consumers.  90 minute is just an outstanding DIPA that tuly lives up to its hype. Poured into a pint glass, the color is so clear amber with a thin white head. ABV is present in the nose, but still the citrusy hops overwhelm.  Good balance of carbonation in the mouth which makes the cascade hops explode. WHAT???? NO MALT???....good.  Mouthfeel is just terrific and this truly is a tasty beer. But go easy on 'em. Thanks be to heaven that it's only a 4-pack.

I'm reviewing the beer again because the first time I reviewed this the beer wasn't chilled enough to start and I think that affected the tasting experience.  The beer poured a nice orange/amber with a thick half-inch head. It left nice lacing on the glass all the way down.  Lots of hops in the aroma. Grapefruit, pine. Pretty strong, but not as strong as other Double IPAs I've tried.  The taste was surprising. There was quite a bit of malt presence, to the point of really seeming out of place for this beer. I would have liked it better with a lot less malt. The beer seemed very unbalanced to me.  I didn't care for the mouthfeel of this beer. It was too syrupy. I don't mind thick beers if they are doppelbocks or stouts, but not in a Double IPA. The high ABV left a nice warming feeling, but it was hard getting past the strange comination of hops and malt that didn't seem to go together well.  Overall, I probably wouldn't purchase any more of this beer.

10099,2093,IPA4me,4.15,"My First Review!  12 oz. bottle. Freshness date stamped on bottle 2-17-06 Poured into a wine goblet  Poured a deep golden/burnt orange color, very clear with minimal carbonation and little head (too conservative a pour?)  The nose was quite different than I had expected, a lot of ripe mango and peach, with just a touch of the citrus that I usually associate with an IPA.  As soon as this brew hits your lips, it's hops (good thing). The flavor is nicely complex, first the hops attack your senses with a citrusy smack, followed by a nice malty sweetness that tries to poke through, only to be beaten back by the hops again.  The mouthfeel is a bit syrupy and the finish is long. Hop oils dance around on your tongue for an eternity.  This is an excellent beer. It's rather complex for an IPA, although it's very hoppy (as expected) there is a nice interplay between various flavors to make you want to keep coming back for more. Because of the high ABV, I couldn't imagine having too many of these in a sitting, but it would sure be fun trying!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Thick 2 finger head that disipated in approx. 5 minutes to a thin lacy layer that coated the glass with each drink.  Smelled sweet and hoppy. First taste was wow. Thick malty body with little hop flavor at first taste that exploded with big hoppy middle and finish. Finished clean and crisp.

A good white frothy head that left good lacing and stayed throughout the tasting.  The smell is tantalizing hoppy with good malt backing. A good bitterness is more dominate with a subtle citrus but mostly pine essence. The malt has some stronger caramel qualities.  The taste is very well balanced, both in hops and malt. The hops are the biggest characteristic with really good balance. The bittering hop is noticeable but not too much of an infringement. This is mixed well through the taste with a good piney finish from the aromatic hops. All of this then is blended with a more then noticeable caramel flavor from the malt. The caramel flavor is more noticeable at the end with the aroma hops.  The body is mid to full. As the beer warms, more flavor is noticeable. As is the malt taste with the adjustment of the mouth to the hoppy taste. The 9% isn't really noticeable at all (or at least until later) as everything is so balanced out. Overall this is one of my favorite beers.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,jabocu,4.33,"Bottle poured into glass.  Pours a peachy color with orange hues. Nice translucent clarity and a small off-white cap that dissapeared fast. Left very faint lacings on surface and sides. Aroma was wonderful with citrus hops, malts, yeast, and ""earthy"" spice notes. The alcohol was apparent in nose, but not too strong. Tasted very sweet, almost syrupy. However, clinches down with a very nice grapefuit and citrus hop bite. The carbonation was just right and finished dry, but left a refreshing fruity aftertaste. I will definitely enjoy this again very soon! In fact I had planned to give one of the bottles out the four pack I bought to a friend of mine....nevermind. I'll wait till I have more to spare.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,rabsten,4.47,"I've been up and down on this one, but now I'm up. Here goes:  Bottle, aged in my fridge for about 3 months. Poured into a pint glass from a 12 oz. bottle. Beautiful thick head, cloudy amber colour. Laces well.  Smells like hops and alcohol, It pomises a hop hit and alchol esters. Kinda piney.  Taste. Slightly sweet, slightly citrus, very hoppy, malty, and full of the alcohol promise hinted at by the scent. Good to great.  Mouthfeel. Mmmm. 'Nuff said. But if you twist my arm, I'd say it's silky, milky, and smooth.  Drinkability. Well, it is a bit harsh. That is to say, it's strong and doesn't let you forget it. That said, it''s goes down smooth, and I'm 3/4 the way through a Four-pack. I will be finishing it tonihgt, too.  Overall, you can do much, much worse than this one. I do suggest you let it age for a bit first.  Bottom line: top notch. Highly recommended.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

My sample is from a 12oz bottle with no born on or best by date. My two favorite characteristics of this beer are the smell and the taste. Piney sweetness is the best way I can desribe the taste. I've introduced this one to a few of my BMC drinking friends who loved this as well. My favorite offering from DFH.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Imstillthegman,4.47,"Just poured from a growler I purchased last night at the brewpub in Rehoboth Beach. Pours a beautiful copper color with minimal head. I believe this is becuase it is from a growler rather than on-tap or bottled as both of them have a nice head. Also, lacing is nowhere to be seen, which is different from the many other times I have had this. The smell is all about hops. Very piney, some grapefruit with a bit of caramel malt. Absolutely delicious! This is one of the best Double IPAs I have ever had. You taste the bitterness from the hops all the way through. There's some sweetness in the middle, but the hops shine again as you swallow. Excellent mouthfeel. Sturdy. Not as much ""tingle"" as other DIPAs. The abv may not make this a wise choice for if you're looking to down a 12 pack, but, if you're looking for a hoppy brew to enjoy, this is it. One of my top 3 DIPAs.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,mrasskicktastic,4.32,"A - Crystal clear copper color with moderate visible carbonation and a one finger very light tan head that has decent retention. A few odd streaks of lacing stick to the glass, but only barely.  S - A smooth pine, grapefruit, light caramel malt and a little alcohol. A very nice and potent odor.  T - Sweet pine flavor, a moderate citrus (grapefruit) over a caramel malt backing with a medium bitter finish. Fairly simply and very flavorful.  M - Smooth and thick, rich and creamy, refreshing.  D - Very easy to drink and deceptively strong. Definitely worth a look if you haven't yet. A few of these could make for a very bad night.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,DrewBeechum,4.29,"Reviewed off an aged bottle (at least 1.5 years old, stored cold)  Amazing hold onto a strong aroma with a piney bitter aroma and a low malty aroma.  Hazy orange. Can see my fingers through the brew, but they are in shadow.  Flavor is bright and pine driven hop bite with a following caramel that rises up a into a orange followup with honey tones.  Surprising, blowup of hops for a beer at least 1.5 years old.  I do like it",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,joeskirkie,4,"A clear pale orange in my oversized wine glass with an excellent big thick white head.  A piney grassy hop scent with orange and lemon.  Tastes dry, bitter, distinct alcohol. It's a bit spicy and grainy, the falvor in general quite intense, my head is swimming. But it's so beautifully balanced.  It's a good medium bodied beer. At 9.0% this thing'll probably kick my ass if I try to take it on.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,allengarvin,4.44,"12 oz bottle, poured into a mug. A beautiful copper pour with a small head but very clingy on the glass. Aroma is gorgeous! Resinous pine needles, crackery toasted dough, spicy, peppery. A joy to just swirl around and smell. All these wonderful notes carry over into the flavor, together with thick, sweet malt and a touch of fruitiness. Flavors linger forever. Good, chewy mouthfeel.  I kind of like the 60 minute better, with all the flavor intensity of these but a little easier drinking. But it's a close call. The ultimate in hoppiness (and that doesn't just mean ""bitter"")",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,bkett01,3.93,"Released a blast of fresh hop carbonation as I popped the cap off. Poured a rich golden amber color with a healthy one inch head. Smell is of grassy hops, but not nearly as dominant as other IPA's I've had. An almost bitter scent can be detected.  The taste is an explosion of hops, barley, and alcohol, which all combine to form a well rounded flavor. A carmel malt bite is followed up with a clean grassy finish. AT 9% ABV, understandably the alcohol is not completely masked. It should also be noted that it doesn't overpower the beer.  Provides a heavier mouthfeel than most other IPA/Double IPA's out there. A very good all around brew that I would recommend to all fellow hophead BA's.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Domingo,4.2,"(Note: this was mistakenly filed under 120 Minute IPA for a week...a definite mistake on my end!)  Pours a dark orange/brown. A little darker than most IPA's, but still too dark to be in the ""oktoberfest"" range. Smell is hoppy and sweet. Piney, but with fruit. Flavor is actually quite complex. Hops hit you a t first, but then it blends into a little bit of grain, then a wave of sweetness, and finally the hops finish things bitter, but dry. Mouthfeel is solid. Just right for a warm day. Not too thick, but not so thin that the flavor doesn't keep up. There's also a nice head that sticks around. Drinkability is limited by your tolerance and how used to high BV brews you are. It's nearly 10%, but it's not so obvious that you'd notice right away. One of my favorite DIPA's. Sometimes this style can be a little too much, but this is a definite winner.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,jj21,4.6,"Pours cloudy amber with a thick, off-white head. Great retention. Super hop aromas but no ttoo overpowering. Very intense sweetness of grapefruit aroma with grassy undertones. DELICIOUS!!! Fantastic balance of hops and malt. Goes down easy for such a big beer. I tried not to compare this with the 60 minute which I also tasted this night and evaluate it on it's own. The extra half-hour does wonders for this beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,kdmorse,4.9,"A: Beautiful copper color with 2+ fingers of off-white head. Bubbles gently rising to the surface. No murkiness or cloudiness to be found. Lacing clings to the glass like Gollum to The Ring (Im a dork, I know).  S: Refreshingly crisp hop scent in the nose balanced well with a sweet malt odor. Hops are very enjoyable with hints of floral smells.  T: B-A-L-A-N-C-E-D. Expecting a hop-based kick in the balls, but it is incredibly balanced. There are hops up front, then a gorgeous, sweet malt flavor, and it finishes clean with a slightly hoppy finish. Pleasant aftertaste that begs for me to take another sip.  M: Nice body. Not too thick but not watery. Exactly what I want out of my beer.  D: Could drink all night except for the alcohol content. Does not taste like 9%, but it can be felt after a few drinks.  Notes: Wow! Unfortunately this beer costs $10.99 for a 4 pack where I shop. If not, I would drink this non-stop. I love it. It makes me want to become famous so that I can get an endorsement deal.

10099,2093,ClearDog,4,"Appearance -- Filtered, light-orange appearance. About a one finger, clean white head, that diminishes rapidly and leaves a skim on top of the beer. Watery lacing.  Smell -- Smells like cereal malts. I purchased a four-pack in November '05 and this is my last bottle. It could be due to this beer's age why I smell an overwhelming amount of malt rather than hops. It's still a pleasant aroma.  Taste -- A malty sweetness followed by slightly bitter hops at the back of the tongue. I'm sure the age of the beer has a lot to do with the diminished hop flavor. Quite mellow . . . and smooth.  Mouthfeel -- Medium, creamy mouthfeel. The finish leaves a pleasant bitterness in the back of the mouth and tongue.  Drinkability -- Good drinkability. I'd be fine with just one or two during a session. They have the tendency to sneak up on you if you aren't careful. This beer ages well, but I cannot wait to pick up some of it fresh.

It is normally served into a snifter with a copper color and a mild head of meadium sized bubbles. The aroma hits you right in the olfactory system...BANG! Theres the hops. The flavor follows the intense aroma and the bitterness lingers in the back of the throat. The only thing you can think of after taking a swallow of this beer is.. I'm still thirsty, I want some more.

10099,2093,MSchae1017,4.83,This beer was tasted in a pint glass from a bottle.  This beer pours a beautiful amber gold with a huge while head that laces and holds fantastically all the way down the beer. The smell is all hops. Mostly a grapefruit aroma but some floral aromas as well. The taste is fantastic. A wonderful mix of mainly citrusy grapefruit flavor from the hops mixed in with some subtle floral tastes and balanced beautifully with some pale malts. This beer is extreamly thick with a good carbonation. Overall I would love to drink this everyday.

Also got a strange scent of maybe tree bark. Can't exactly pin that one down. Taste starts off with a bang of hops. Then mellows as it goes down. I get a tiny warming sensation as it goes down from the alcohol. Although it does not have an alcohol taste.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,beermanbrian,4.37,"Thanks to the eminent maltygoodness.  Pours a nice yellow/orange color. OK head and lacing with an amazing amout of carbonation.  I can never get enough of that great AIPA pine smell but this beer gets close. It delivers a ton of pine smell from the second you pop the cap. It does mellow with time and gets covered a little by the heavy amount of malt and high alchohol.  The malt really starts to show itself at the first sip. This beer has a balance that a lot of doubles don't have. The malt is not candy sweet but is definately present and balances nicely with the bitterness from the heavy dose of hops. You never forget that the hops is there though.  The alcohol is present but not in an obtrusive way. No killer aftertaste of too sweet or bitter, I would say just right. Being the Double IPA that I think I've liked the best this gets good marks on drinkability. While I've appreciated some other double's for what they are, the sweetness normally drives me away from really seaking them out again but i could see going back to this one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

This beer poured leaving a 1.5 finger head that dissipated fairly quickly, leaving a nice amount of lacing in the glass. Color is deep amber and transparent. Smell is of hops and fruit. Much sweeter smell than I was expecting and very nice. Upon first sip, the hops make their presense known, but are quickly followed my the sweet malts that the nose first finds. Very balanced for such a srong beer. Mouthfeel is medium and creamy. Feels nice. Drinkability, well, it's only drawback is the 9.0 abv. The taste will certainly leave you wanting another.

T - Malty tart sweetness, followed by strong citrus/NW american hop flavor. Grapefruits. Heavy malt sweetness - toffee, smoke - balanced out by forceful bitterness and tasty tangy, fruity, citrusy, juicy hop flavor. Very nice balance here. Alcohol well masked.  M - medium bodied. A bit chewy. Tart, dry hop bitterness makes you pucker.  D - very, very tasty brew.

10099,2093,tattooedtolley,4.6,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Clear copper color with a slight head.  Smell: What a great aroma, hoppy and fruity.  Taste: I had very high expectations for this double IPA. Having high expectations normally lets me down but not this beer. The taste was amazingly hoppy and sweet at the same time. I have never had such a mixture of sweetness along with incredible hops. I could tell the alcohol was there but there was nothing overwhelming about it.  Mouthfeel: Nice body to it, not as crisp as many IPA's but I expect that comes from the extra time involved here. A great change from the much more crisp IPA.  Drinkability: While I could drink a few of these in an evening, I find this beer to be a bit too good to throw back an entire 4 pack in one sitting. I drank two and saved the other two.  One of the best offerings I have had from Dogfish. I will certainly buy again and again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Stinky, floral, minty, relentless hops. Lightly carmely malts are in the background, but the minty aspect of the hops really shine through. Smells fantastic.  Taste: Maltier and more well balanced than I was expecting. The bready malts are really enhanced by how strong the hops are in the beginning of the flavor. The second half of the flavor is pure hoppiness. Tongue ripping, juicy hops. Very good.  Mouthfeel: Slick at first, then a sharpness provided by the alcohol and carbonation.  Drinkability: A very good Double IPA, a different one, also. Maybe one of the maltiest DIPAs I have ever tried.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Appearance: Deep burnt orange with a coppery head that dissipated into a thin lace about a minute after the initial pour.  Smell: Vaguely fruity and quite appetizing.  Taste: Extreme hop bitterness, as expected. Maybe some peaches in the finish?  Mouthfeel: Supple, but not quite chewy. Really zings you with bitterness but is not overpowering.  Drinkability: An absolutely delicious beer that forces you to respect it. There's no trace of the 9% abv at any point, so it would be pretty dangerous as a session beer.

10099,2093,MEANxOLDxTOM,4.5,"I was afraid of this at first but the Mike Brawley of Brawley's beverage talked me into it. I really like barleywines and he told me to think of it as a friend of the barleywine. After drinking Bigfoot I saw what he ment.  This is a unique beer. The imperial IPA has an amber color, with a very thin white head that disappears quickly, but leaves a lacing around the glass. the smell is very hoppy with a slight fruit or floral note, and a the sweetness of malt. I am not normally an IPA fan, but this beer is different. It hits you right up front with the hops, but the body mellows with a nice malty taste(a very slight ting of fuit), but it finishes like a hoppy pale ale. The Malt definitely takes the edge off of the hopps that an IPA would normally have. With the high abv I would have expected more taste of alcohol, but it is not very noticeable.Balanced and smooth. Mouthfeel: this beer is thick, and almost chewy, but very enjoyable. I feel that I could drink this beer very often, and that is contrary to what I expected. I really wish I would have bought more of it. I won't make that mistake next time.  just for the record this was a 12oz bottle.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,PeatReek,4.17,"Presentation: medium-cool 12 oz bottle.  Appearance: Deep amber, nearly orange body yet crystal clear (quite an accomplishment for this quantity of hops). Nice thick rocky head with an orangey tinge.  Aroma: Collosal hop bouquet, positively electrical (really! smells a little like ozone). Bright, bright fruity hops with tinges of lemons, grapefruit, apricot, maybe some pear even. Do I smell any malts? Not likely!  Taste & Mouthfeel: The great part about the way 90 minute tastes is that it's a multi-sensory experience. All of the aromas I can smell on the beer come through double in the sip, and also this broad-based, full tingly sensation that really wakes up the tongue. Meaty? Savory? Those sound disgusting in relation to beer, but I don't know how else to communicate the substantiality of the flavor and mouthfeel of this beer. It's definitely heavy-bodied, but anything less would collapse under all these hops. Alcohol is prominent but not overwhelming; a pleasant warmth.  Drinkability: The only downfall of the 90 minute - the huge hop flavor, syrupy body and high alcohol definitely make this a 1-serving beer.

The beer poured a light copper color, clear. The carbonation was good, but I did not get much of a head. No worries.  The nose, on the other hand, was an explosion of hops, floral, crisp, resiny, and potent.  My palate enjoyed a delicious balance with these hops and the sweet malts. The flavors were grassy, yet smooth!  The finish, as well, was long and divine. The herbal flavors twisting and turning for minutes after each swallow. And speaking of, the carbonation was great, and thre mouthfeel properly viscuous.  This, believe it or not, was my first sampeling from the acclaimed Doghead Fish brewery.

It was my first DIPA at the time...little did I know what it would eventually develop into.  Pours a perfect golden straw color. The body sparkles its so clear. White one inch head that slowly worked its way down leaving a rim of lace.  Aroma is quite unique, a virtual smorgasboard of individual hops all fight to be the first out of the glass. Lots of floral and grassy hops. Some noble varieties pick their way through as well. Biscuit malts round it out well. Lots of hops but seems to be balanced well.  Taste is almost exactly like the aroma. A bit of sweetness due to the alcohol comes through, but it blends in perfectly. Doesn't taste overly bitter though, but still loaded with hops. This is a DIPA I could really have all the time with no complaints. The typical west coast hop flavor is getting overdone, its nice to have something different.  Medium body mouthfeel.

T: Tastes of orange and floral hops with a slight background of malt. High alcohol level is noticeable as it warms your body on the way down. Bitterness is noticeable but only for a second. Tingly on the tounge. Nice tasting beer.  M & D: Mouthfeel is pretty damn good on this offering from dogfish. It's a perfect mesh of the 120 and the 60.

The hops are practically jumping out of the glass.  T - The grassy earth vibe continues here. Very similar to the 60 minute sister brew. The added ABV factor is present, but not overwhelming. A perfect influx of maltiness across the midrange leads to a range of mild sweetness (insert fruit adjectives here). The hops never really attack, but are always present with the best possible balance nonetheless.  M/D - The creamiest IPA I remember tasting. A smooth feel throughout lends to excellent drinkability. The overabundance of hops does not dry out and lead to a bitter finish, but instead creates a mellow afterglow. Very pleasant.  This is my new favorite IPA, and in my mind the ultimate session beer.

Dryness, alcohol and fruitiness on the finish  Love the blance of this and carbonation is spot on  Super drinkable. I think the malt heft compliments the IBUs just right. Belies it's ABV. Nice reward after trying a few horrid ones (other breweries)last night... too good to deny myself",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,dawg,4.29,"Poured from the tap into a pint glass. Looked very clear. Head retention was nice.  Smelled like very fresh hops, floral, mild citrusy.  Tasted very good. Almost remindes me the taste you get when I bury my head in a pile of hops. Or hop sampling. Nice smooth and big bubbly. The head kept releasing the nice pure hop smell. Not much but some intense hop oily traces. Very pure, this keg wasn't spoiled one bit. Nice solid feel. Very drinkable if you can stand up to the alcohol content.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,gmcfarre,4.67,"I wasn't sure if I was ready for this... In other words, I havn't fully developed that hops addiction that seems to be a prerequisite for enjoying a Double IPA and many IPAs (American at least). Regardless, I saw a single at the store and I went for it. 12 oz bottle dated 1/10/06 poured into a St. Bernardus Chalice/Oversize Wine Glass thingy.  A- Clear ruby orange/red. No head at all, and I poured it fairly aggressively. Bottle did let out quite the hiss when I popped the cap though. Decent amount of wispy thingies on top with slight carbo bubbles rising throughout.  S- Super F'n hops! I could smell them from the bottle at a distance. Don't be fooled though, these hops are well balanced by a floral/grassy scent.  T- Well, hoppy bitterness predominates but this brew has an astringent character that helps balance that out. Mmmmm.  M- Fairly crisp, but equally thick. Feels just right for this brew. Not to much carbonation or any other failures.  D- Superb (taste-wise). In other words the high ABV did not make its presense known and become something to gag on later in the beer. Nevertheless, I can definitely feel that 9% in me!  P.S. I am now addicted to hops.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Byeast,4.42,"Poured a clear , deep bronze-orange with a bubbly off white head of about a half inch. Nice bands of lacing were left as i drank this hoppy treat. Taken to the nose , hops hit ya like booya beatch! Exellent herbal-green, floral, and fruity fresh smells , as well as a tinge of alcohol. Taste is equally as complex and fresh! Much hop bite , floral-citrus , pine, and a bit of alcohol, tad bit of raisin with a bitter finish. Mouthfeel is kinda creamy with a long lingering aftertaste. This American Double IPA is the best iv'e had so far. It is so drinkable for its ABV. Drinking one of these just makes me say outloud "" Damn i love hops!"" Exellent offering from Dogfish Head.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,RJLarse,4.22,"I picked up a couple of these at a local craft beer store to review. I poured this beer into a glass chalice.  Pours a nut brown copper color in the glass and is clear. Lots of bubbles rising in the glass suggests a very effervescent beer. Two fingers of pure white head dissipates to a creamy thin film, which sticks to the side of the glass while drinking, and hangs around until the very end.  The smell is fairly strong and smells of fir, pine or some other evergreen, and citrus.  The taste is both sweet and bitter at the same time. There is a dominant citrus flavor, but also hints of mint or pine. There is an intense hoppy flavor after the swallow. The taste is a very complex combination and hard to describe.  Mouthfeel is crisp and clean, but a little thick and sticky.  This is a drinkable beer, with an excellent taste and aroma. With the higher ABV I cant see myself drinking more than a couple of these in a sitting, but thoroughly enjoying them when I do.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,mooseisloose,4.34,"After enjoying many bottles of dogfish head's 60 minute IPA I am glad to find some 90 minute imperial IPA to try!  Smell upon opening the bottle is like th tropical rainforest after a rain. Fresh and abundant in fruity citrus-like odors.  Poured it into a chalice and the head was sparkly with large bubbles. Color is a orange-bronze. Head dissapates quikly but lacing is very clinging. Smell in the glass is very sweet and earthy with citrus overtones. Taste is very sweet. Carbonation is lower than expected from the head witnessed, but sufficient. Very substancial flavor but the high ABV is not at all detectable. The mouthfeel is very smooth and the transition from sip to mouthful to finish is wonderful. The flavor seems to swirl in your mouth covering many different taste buds from citrus to dandelion.  Most definitely a very distinguished beer. A pleasure to quaff.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,bigdeuce,4.29,"HOLY HOPS!! Classic IPA! Decent lacing down the glass, very malty, and hoppy. Well balanced. Grapefruit and more grapefruit, washing down with the big hop flavor. Very amazing how drinkable it is considering the ABV. Very much recommended, just wish it came in 6 packs. I hate 4 packs!!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,AltBock,4.2,"12oz. bottle with a label that was made from this rough paper, not the usual smooth paper label. The front of the label had their symbol and info about the beer. No date on the back or side.  When I poured in into my Snifter , it came out this nice dark amber/orange color with just a little skim of foam at the top. The foam dissipated fast and left no signs of rings or lace around it. It dissipated so fast that I couldn't tell which color it was. It was more than likely white in color. It had a nice aroma of juicy fruits up front and with some citrus fruits, little malt, and a huge helping of hops at the end. The taste was pretty good. The taste had plenty of different kinds of fruits (too hard to tell which ones were in it), very little malt, and at the end, a very nice strong piny hops flavor. Just the right amount of hops at the end. The mouthfeel was kind of hoppy and I also noticed this slight alcohol aftertaste as well. Just what I would expect from a 9%ABV IPA. Drinkability? I wouldn't mind another one. A 4-pack could go a long ways for me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,DarkerTheBetter,4.25,"This beer came in an oversized chubby tulip glass that was a glowing candy apple amber with a thin slightly tan film for a head. I didnt care so much about the short head because the glass was filled right up to the brim.  Smells of maple syrup, and a dry cedar and spruce hop.  The malt base of this tastes like dark caramel and a mild marshmallow that is followed by a separate and distinct sharp grassy pine hop. Where the malt and hop intersect, theres a momentary pineapple sourness. Finishes with a sour black liquorish and pine accompanied by some dry piney burps.  The mouth feel is medium body with a light carbonation that really fills up my mouth with an enticing over all thickness that helps deliver all of the flavors.  I find that in this beer, the way the malt and hop flavors stand at a distance and balance one another out is very impressive. This is way more intricate than when its in the bottle. Seek it out on tap for sure!  Found this on-tap ran through Randall The Enamel Animal at the DFH pub. That totally blew my freakin mind. Un-real! They used warrior hops and it turned ol 90 mn into a completely different creature. Sure, the hop tone got cranked up, but the mouth feel turned into pure silk. It felt dry (not tasted dry) on my tongue, and unbelievably smooth. Im putting the drinkablity of the Randalized 90 mn somewhere around a 7. I think I may drive back to DFH just to try this again.  Seek this experience out at all costs!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,phisig137,4.01,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle with very little head that quickly disappated. Shows a very pale caramel color in the glass, just shy of amber.  Aroma is dominated by hops, particulalry some west coast type of hops with huge alpha acids, such as simcoe or warrior. Very nice balance between citrus and floral aromas.  The palate of this beer I think has to be one of the best balanced imperial IPA's I've ever tasted. The first sip almost tastes like you're sucking on a hop cone, but by the end palate the hop presence is nicely rounded out into a malty finish.  A true winner here I believe. Loads of hops, lots of malt, and a sizeable dose of alcohol that hides itself well.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Hautacam,4.28,"Have had this in bottles several times and on tap twice now at ""Moan and Dove"", and at ""My Place"" last night. Beatiful orange amber color, clear , with a foamy tan head, which lowers to a film ,but stays. Smells really nice; like a pineapple plantation thats next to a Christmas tree farm, hops are in your nose , bigtime, but also a little alcohol. Tastes great....intense hop flavor which has almost no bitterness at first , alcohol , and sugar( just the right amount of both)...with a nice semi dry finish with some hop bitters coming through ...almost as an aftertaste. Mouthfeel is nice ..medium to heavy...near perfect with the taste, low to medium carbonation. Damn this is good stuff! Drinkable...well , maybe have 2...but high ABV...?? 60 min DFH is always in my fridge...always goes with food for me..but this 90 min is up a few notches into the ...sit , sip,smell, and ponder how great it is ...and every few minutes say...""Damn this is good stuff !!"" to anyone who'll listen.

10099,2093,kkipple,4.45,"This beer holds a special place in my heart as the drink that turned me on to just how good beer could be. I was in Denver, looking for a bottle of wine, and spotted the Dogfish selection. Recalling an unqualified recommendation I'd read online, I picked up a four pack. A year later, my love affair with micro-brews in general and the Dogfish Head Brewery in particular continues. Anytime I have this beer it brings back memories of that first wonderful glass.  Poured from a bottle into my Chimay goblet -- why not, I figured. First impression of this light amber colored beer is the bubbles; there are tons. They subside after a few minutes, but still provide enough bubbliciousness (sp?) to keep the head from disappearing. Lacing is spotty.  Smells like hops. Y'know, that grapefruit and slightly piney, grassy, sweet scent. This beer makes no attempt to hide what you're about to taste. Hops and lots of 'em.  Taste? Great! DFH 90 minute is an amazingly hoppy, smooth and carbonated beer. There's an initial hops rush, and a tingly, bubbly effervescence (I love using that word), followed by a light malt taste that fills the mouth. Finishes dry and warm, that's the 9% saying hello.  Mouthfeel is bubbly, smooth, coating, and dry. Very smooth in fact, this one almost jumps down your throat.  Drinkable? 9% aside, yes. I mean, it's not a ""session"" beer, but neither is so filling as to preclude you having another.  Bottom line, this is a hoppy, smooth beer and a fantastic Double IPA. Dogfish Head again shows why they're one of the top micros in the US. I have yet to meet anyone who doesn't like this beer. Drink if possible.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Tupperwolf,4.83,"There's nothing quite like a great craft beer from its proper pint glass - a lovely rounded contraption with a heavy base from DFH.  This pours a nice clear mahogany amber totally full of rising bubbles with a thick, rocky, gorgeous head that clings to the glass in total walls of white lacing. Yum yum yum. Very appealing.  It's hard to discern any malt prescence in the scent other than the fact that the scent is full and boisterous; The nose is all hop, hop all the way, to the core; The interesting thing to me is that the hop aromas in this are like nothing I've experienced so far; Instead of being pungently tangy and spicy like grapefruit or pine, the hops in the smell are round, sleek, with a gentle zing and a smooth, whiskeylike burned brown sugar quality.  Wow, wow, what a flavor - this is definitely a DIPA in the way it's built, but what comes out at the end of the build is like nothing I've tried so far. In the words of my roommate, it's juicy and mellow, and I totally agree. I think the defining thing about the hops in this beer is that they are oily, oily, oily. They have a kind of quick warm, caustic quality, but they quickly settle to their resounding qualities of mellow, sleek, and cool. Very hard to describe, but totally unique and delicious.  The mouthfeel is so oily it's crazy. The carbonation is hard to notice because the body is so heavy and wonderfully, obscenely slick. I love it.  For a double IPA, this is not as brutal and aggressive as most; But a DIPA it most definitely is. Wow, what a beer. I see how it's earned the accolates it's ammassed so far.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Zorro,4.42,"Pours a clear dark orange ale with a good tan colored head.  Smell is sweet and very heavy on the hop scent. Sharp bitter scent of eucalyptus leaf with menthol, pine, citrus, mint, along with some black pepper riding the alcohol fumes.  Taste is sweet with a very strong hop flavor from the very first sip. Strong bitter oranges are the first flavor that I notice along with a metallic after taste from over stimulated taste bud nerves. After the initial shock you can pick out more individual flavors. Good flavors of base woodiness with spicy and fruity highlights. An interesting beer where the tart and bitter hit your taste buds first with a sweeter finish. Borderline harshness here but not really just really ballsy.  Mouthfeel is good.  A very tasty and drinkable beer in the super IPA Class. I can't give this a 5 rating though because I have had Three Floyds Dreadnaught that defines what a ""5"" IPA really tastes like.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,johnniemarg,4.73,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into my delerium tremens tulip. This is a translucent amber/orange with almost no head and no visible carbonation coming up through the beer. Very light white film on top with really tiny bubbles against the side of the glass look like they're gonna lace nicely. 5 minutes later, yeah, it sure does lace nicely. Pretty, tiny, uniform bubbles easy to make out in the lacing  Smell is almost all citrus to me at first with a delicate spiciness in the background and piney hops. That ""spiciness"" might be a slight burn of alcohol in my nose. Smells clean.  I fucking love the taste of this. Everything that was in the aroma is in the flavor, but unbelievably perfectly balanced. This and Stoudt's Double IPA are my 2 favorites of the style. This is just plain outstanding and tasty.  Mouthfeel is just about perfect to me, really thick and creamy. Those tiny bubbles on the side of the glass were a sure sign of what was to come.  It's a double IPA, so you aren't going to session with this. But this is one of my favorite beers. I don't think you could disagree if you're a fan of this style of beer. Dogfish Head is my favorite brewery because of this, the WWS and the 120 minute.

The smell is citrusy, oily hops that don't dominate like I would have expected them to. There are hints of grain bread in the background. Taste is mild hops that hit first with a weird white bread flavor malt afterwards that finishes with a hint of piney hops. This is not nearly as hoppy as most IPAs I've had recently. The carbonation is perfect and the beer goes down smooth. I would like to try this again. It is a good beer, though it is not what I would turn to if I was dying for some hops. For 9% alcohol, you sure could drink alot of this...",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,asabreed,4.89,"12 oz. bottle into my oversized wine glass.  Appearance: The weakest part about this beer in a glass for sure, unless there's something wrong with my glass. Head fades quickly and doesn't build as it should, the lacing's not as I would've wanted or expected (but it's still there in blots as I drink) and I thought the slightly hazy brown / red / orange color would be darker. Still, it looks pretty good, and I think I was petitioning for too much, as it's been a while since I had the brew on tap.  Smell: Possibly the most perfect IPA aroma around. Intense, balanced, aromatic, slightly heart-stopping, and beyond a perfume. Tons of hops, TONS of hops. And what breaks it down a bit is the excellently balanced malts; without that the aroma would go to quite possibly awful places. This is perfection.  Taste: So much balance, so much taste, so much of a great finish. A perfect balance between the malts, quelling the insanity of the hops, providing not only a fantastic finish and a lingering field of flowers on the tongue, but also a great experience from to-the-mouth to go-again. This is not only not easy, but is, here, done how it's supposed to be done. And there's a beautiful dryness, to boot.  Mouthfeel: Thick, slightly velvety, and finishes with the right amount of carbonation to make it work well in the mouth.  Drinkability: If you haven't already, you need to try this. It's been a year since I had it on tap, but clearly I need to have it on tap again. From the bottled version comes this review. Maybe DFH's best beer, also. Near perfection in a bottle, especially with such a style that's not the easiest to squeak beauty out of much of the time.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,tommy78,4,"Poured it out of the bottle, with minimal head. The appearance had a copperish color to it. In terms of smell, not quite strong. A bit hoppy but subtle. Taste was very surprising. A bit fruity but combined well with the hops. As soon as I drank it, the beer bounced around. Going down, it left a strong but sweet flavor. It fills up the belly fast, so I could only have 2 at most. The best time of the year to have it is in the summertime. It has that summertime feel and taste to it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,jslot38,4.37,"Presentation: 12 oz. bottle, date marked.  Appearance: Golden body with deep amber hues. White frothy head settles to about 3/4 of an inch with rising carbonation. Lacing is ridiculous.  Smell: Grassy pines with slight floral touches and drifting notes of orange peel backed up with grounded biscuit tones.  Taste: Slick oil pertrudes from the pugnant hops. Fantastic use of pine and grassy hops. Zesty citrus undertones are perfectly layered into a lovely body of slightly biscuity malts. But this one is all about the hops. Slight touch of grapefruit surrounded by floral and earth ridden hops levels of and holds for quite some time.  Mouthfeel: Absolutly smooth, perfect level of carbonation.  Notes: Certainly another prime example of why DFH is a great innovative brewery. Building off their 60 minute IPA this one is a great brew for hop heads. At 9% the alcohol is so well hidden, almost unnoticable, this could certainly sneak up on you, but absolutly in a good way.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,clabaugh,4.4,"Appearance: Pours a very clear, amber with crimson inflections. A rich, creamy head with off-white tones crowns this inviting selection. The head retains well, and lace coats the glass throughout.  Smell: Abundant floral hops, with some sweet nectar punching through. Toasted barley interjects itself to create a pleasing milieu.  Taste: Delicious floral hops that are ever so juicy. Hardly bitter, and teasingly sweet. Excellent balance, with hops nicely countered with rich barley malt. Some molasses and pear rind are detectable.  Mouthfeel: Wonderfully creamy and full bodied for a double IPA. Great sensations on the palate with light bitterness.  Drinkability: Very tasty, sensually pleasing, and thoroughly satisfying. The taste encourages having one after another. A bit filling, but negligible. Great beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

This time though, something was amiss. Poured a perfect amber with a thick head that took a few minutes to settle. Smell was citrusy and very hoppy as well with lots of floral aromas and somewhat spicy towards the end. Tatse was definetly good but nothing in comparison to the other times I've tried this beer. For one, the malty sweetness that initially made me adore this beer was nearly gone. The hop presence was heightened a bit, but even so, it seemed a bit flat. It started off very earthy and tasty and then just seemed to fall flat on its face with no lingering flavors to speak of. Mouthfeel was medium/light (very uncharacteristic for this beer) making it easy to drink. I don't know if this is a new or just plain old crappy batch, but frankly im missing the old 90 minute. To be honest, it tasted more like the 60 minute then the 90. I'll grab it again, but im praying that it wont be like the batch im drinking now and will be like my good ol' friend 90.

This is a different animal entirely. This is a hoppy brew for sure but the grain bill on this beer ensures that the malt character is more than just a fleeting glimpse.. It is ever present and tasty. But at 9% ABV the alcohol is generally MIA in the aroma and taste.  Alas on with the review.  This is the last bottle in the third - ""four pack"" of this fine brew that I have consumed. Odd that I have not reviewed this outstanding beer before??? Whats up with that???  Appearance is crystal clear - oxidized copper with a generous off - white head that leaves sheets of sticky lace in it's fighting withdrawal. Fades to a persistent layer of head that lasts through the end of consumption ... a long time.  Aroma is fresh green leaves, pine, grapefruit and orange pith. A backbone of swweet malts holds it all together, This is an balanced olfactory experience, not the beat your sinuses senslessness of some hoppy brews - sigh. I am not a hop-head per se but I hhave nad still do richly enjoy a SNPA or Smutty IPA.  Taste has some characteristics of a North American Barley Wine. Very hoppy with a strong malt back-bone - Sierra's Bigfoot 2005 comes to mind. They make an extremely hoppy Barleywine in my humble opinion. Some pine, some iodine, some grapefruit pith and a sweet dose of malt and a bit of bite ...alcohol perhaps???  This is a full-bodied brew with a slick, rich tongue coating mouthfeel that fades slowly. Ths rich, heady brew is a sipper and a rich brew to be savored.  Drinkable?

There was no discernable date on the bottle though, so I'll just have to assume it's fresh. It begins by pouring a golden ruby color with a very small white head that leaves an oily film behind. It has a very strange aroma, one I haven't come across yet in a beer. It's all malt with an accompanying sweetness, but there's a tang that hits at the conclusion. The taste is a large sticky sweetness due to an overwhelming malt base. There is a fruitiness that contributes to the sweetness. It finishes with a burst of alcohol and a cough syrup element that isn't very appealing. As I mentioned earlier, I can't picuk up any hops, no flavor, no bitterness, nothing. It has a very English barleywine-ish taste with the sticky sweet fruitiness and high alcohol. It's light on carbonation and a bit cloying.

10099,2093,IceAce,4.17,I deliberately poured this twelve ounce sample aggressively in order to raise a two finger collar of foam...and I succeeded. Body is orange-copper and the foam a very light tan with two distinct sections; one creamy and the other large-bubbled. Clarity is surprisingly good for the double (Imperial?) IPA style.  Hops are the show-stopper here...and the do so right from the start. The aroma is oh-so-sweet with pine trees colliding with grapefruits. One could (and does!) get lost in the aroma of the hop monster with the supportive malt backbone.  Entry is...well...omigod...even hoppier than imagined. The warning flag flown by the nose does not reflect the power of the storm in this instance. Supportive carbonation ushers bales of hop firecrackers around the insides of the cheeks...where they promptly detonate like little tiny hop bombs.  Midtaste is the only point where the malt is officially allowed to come out and play...but the appearance is enough to show that it is strong enough to carry the tonnage of hops.  The finish begins with a rear-of-the-tongue coating piney hop blast quickly giving way to that way-too-much-hop so I can't describe it type taste which lingers for a good many seconds. Grapefruit rinds and pine cones continue to ping-pong down my throat until I realize that there is still one more treat left...the malts pull off a cameo appearance and actually manage to get the last word in the way of lip-licking sweetness.  Not much of a session beer...but I'd love to have a growler handy to douse the flames from a really smokin' batch of Buffalo wings!  Many thanks to my Secret Santa froggyfrog for making this possible!,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,danielocean03,4.5,"Pours a clear and beautiful reddish amber with a full finger head that faded after a few minutes that fell to faint lacing that is white to off white in color. Immediately gives off heavy aromatic notes of citrusy and piny hops, smells sweetly of caramel yet fresh and clean. This is one hoppy beer, probably the hoppiest I've ever consumed to date. Although the hops are certainly the highlight of this brew, the English two-row barley has certainly erased the majority of the bitterness and hides the alcohol content superbly. Finishes exceptionally clean with hint of a bitter aftertaste. Overall, an outstanding brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,skillerified,4.43,"Fills the glass in a beautiful golden amber color that turns a little yellow around the edges. The white, half-finger head fades fast, but leaves nice lacing. The color is really nice though. Resembles a pear brandy, except it's a little darker.  The first thing that jumps out about the scent is that it's very fresh. Not in the sense that it's a fresh bottle, but the scent brings to mind freshness. It's a little lemon and other citrus. Some pine scents. There's a spicy character too. It's pleasant to me, but my wife just said it was like kitchen cleaner. I suppose lemon and pine would do that to some. I guess I don't use the cleaners as often as her, big surprise.  Taste has multiple layers. There's the citrus layer, mostly lemon, but there are defintely some other citrus type flavors there. Orange maybe. There's the earthy layer, mostly cut grass with a little pine too. There's a pleasant spicy bite too, particularly on the finish. Alcohol, I suppose. Very tasty and well balanced too.  Light to medium bodied with a hint of early sweetness and a well managed late bitterness. Carbonation is mild. Quite well done.  This is a very tasty brew. Complex and well-balanced, but easy to drink. Could make a good intro to micros for someone with a taste for slightly bitter beers. It actually seems a little easier to drink than DH's 60 Minute IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I came across a bottle of the 60, 90, and 120 minute IPA's (among others I plan to review shortly). Deciding on trying the 90 min first and of course, I admit that I made the right choice.  I poured this into a snifter and was pleased by the dark copper color and the slightly off white head. Lacing was good. I let it mellow and warm since it was too cold when I poured it. After a couple minutes, I decided to dive in. The aroma is pleasantly hoppy with a citrus/apricot that makes me think of hefty use of Amarillo and Simcoe. Background notes of pine(?) and spice. Knowing this was a 9% ABV, I was worried that it would be unbalanced but the taste was pleasant with a subtle sweetness with strong hop notes. Malt notes held up to the bitterness. The finish was quick and overall wonderful. This was a wonderfully balanced beer. I just wish I had bought the 4 pack.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

A little bit of butterscotch flavor too. Full mouthfeel. Drinkability is insanely high for a 9% beer. One of my favorite ipas, and it's even better on tap than in the botte.

Almost a belgian type yeast taste at the beginning followed by a white wine taste on the palate with the sweetness lingering for an extended period of time.

Very sweet, floral hop fragrance strong notes of citrus and pine. Explosion of hops across the tongue, sweet green raisins, candied citrus fruit, congnac, huge complexity yet very balanced between the hops and sweet caramel malts. Medium to full bodied, a bit syrupy as it goes down, finishes with a sticky, warming alcoholic bite. Aside from the thick palate, this is really a great beer.

Nose is of course hoppy with lots of piney scents, although there is more malt than expected in the background. Taste was hoppy but less so than expected, not quite the oily-juicy texture I get from a Ruination...this is still delicious but i feel it is just slighty lesser than Ruination for the style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,ChuckD,4.32,"12 oz bottle with an 11/10/05 bottled on date.  Not an enormous head - but one with plenty of beautiful lacing. Rings and rings abound. Color is a little lighter than what you'd expect from this syle. I'll chalk it up to the hops.  The nose is perfect. Fresh and juicy - the hop oils really jump out, with a touch of sweetness hovering.  I love the taste of this beer. The hops - the malts. It's near ideal. The kicked up bitterness is tempered ever so slightly by the sweet grainy malts. Near perfect in the mouth.  They define this at 9%. It does not come across that way while drinking - but you come to believe it soon after. A highly drinkable powerlode.  Musings: I am not a huge Dogfish fan. I think some of their brews are overrated. I drank this new bottling because I couldn't resist. I'll keep a few in the dark for another year or so and see what happens. I can't imagine the tastes can get any better. A highly enjoyable APA that bests Ruination IMHO.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

But after a couple of them i got a good feel for it. It poured out a deep orange color, unfortuantley not much of a head because of the way the barkeep poured it. A very piney, hoppy smell. First sip is bitter to the tounge but not overpowering. Very crisp.

Reveiw from notes.  The beer had a somewhat cloudy appearance to it. The color was a orangish burgundy shade. The smell was very fruity. The head lasted as long as the beer did. The taste was of hops but not as much as you would think. There was another taste thrown in. Odd as it may sound, this beer had hints of a bannanna milkshake in there too. The alcohol is very well hidden in this brew. The mouthfeel is good considering the high ABV. Drinkability is good for one or two glasses but nothing beyond that. This is not a session beer. I will have this again on occasion.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,orfeu,4,"12 oz bottle. Crystal clear golden orange hue with dense off-white head. Nose is massive citrus blossom and sweet caramelly malts. The taste reveals a certain even-handedness of gigantic malts and orange/grapefruit hoppiness, but there's something missing. I think it's that there's no ""middle"" flavor, specifically the rounded peach fruitiness that can really pull everything together in such a big IPA. This isn't a bitter hop monster a la Ruination, but the citric flavor is still there. Even so, there's a thick crystal malt sweetness that just becomes more cloying as the bottle progresses. Medium thick body, slick alcoholic and syrupy mouthfeel. I used to think this was amazing, and I'm not sure whether it's the beer or my palate that has changed. In any case, I can think of a few other DIPAs that I'd rather be drinking. Not bad, but certainly far from astounding.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,bennetj17,4.15,"Minimally cloudy with an orange-amber hue, this brew pours with only a bit of foam yet moderate carbonation bubbling to the surface. I can smell a sugary sweetness with plenty of hops. The flavor is a nice balance- a decent amount of sweet brown sugary malt, with a nice grassy bitterness to follow it up. After a few drinks the bitter comes on even stronger and lingers for quite awhile. It's got a smooth, medium body with adequate carbonation. This beer goes down nicely and hides the 9% alcohol content well.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Regardless, I intended to enjoy this. I did. What a wonderful brew. The hop bitterness bites first, but a nice citrus quality emerges aftger a few sips, especially as is mellows in the glass and the temperature rises. For such a strong beer, it was surprisingly mellow, and well balanced. It goes down easily and is warming. The alcohol content can catch up on you. I really love this beer. If it were not for the price, I would always have some on hand.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,charlatan,3.51,"I bought a 12oz bottle for $2.79 hoping that it would be even better than the 60 minute I had on draft earlier in the year. I think the fridge was a little too cold because when I first poured it the amber nectar had very little head, but as I drank the head got bigger and bigger. I assume this was down to warming. I thought the label was unusually fetching (it was different from the one currently pictured here). There was no freshness date, but since the brewer's website says that this beer ages well I suppose that isn't a big issue.  I was expecting to be knocked flat by a big citrus or pine smell, but all I could make out (and this didn't change much as the beer warmed) was sweet maltiness with a hint of treacle.  The malt I smelled turned out to be copious and rather biscuity in nature. Alcohol was very apparent although not in an offensive way. There were some hops (presumably a lot of them, but that really wasn't apparent) chugging away in the background like a workmanlike rhythm section, but they never took control in the manner I expect from the finest IPA's.  This is a good beer and I'm glad I bought it (the woman in front of me at Whole Foods remarked that it must be good presumably because of the price), but I actually prefer the 60 minute IPA, a less filling beer with a much better flavour.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The first time I tried this beer about 4 months ago my palate wasnt ready for double IPAs. I didnt enjoy it much. After months of drinking good beer and developing my taste for it, I have come to really appreciate this beer. 60 minute is no longer my favorite DFH brew. Great hoppiness, followed/mixed with an awesome sweetness that reminds me of caramel. Citrus is playing in the background. Creamy with great balance. The 9% ABV is virtually undetectable. Finishes sweet and dry. What a great beer.  Mouthfeel is great. Not overly carbonated. Soft and almost buttery feel, with hop oiliness involved in there.  Excellent drinkability.

Looks like just a slight haze, I love to look at this through the light. looks so rich. thick whitish/tan head. TONS of lacing in this one.  Smell: immediate hop as i open the beer. A creamy orange citrus is present. this beer gives me a warmig sensation as i sniff it- imo from the hops and alcohol. (i didnt think the alcohol would be as present)  Taste: I think by saying hoppy would be 1. understood, and 2. one hell of an understatement. crap load of hops. Despite that, i really liked the malts in this one, stated that i has a ridiculous amount of english two-row barley. a great balance. some citrus goodness to it. gives it an extra kick. It is very creamy... the alcohol helps with this effect and gives it quite a warmth.  Mouthfeel: nice. I like the creamyness and chewiness to it, but still has a slick quality to it as i swallow. Medium carbonation. certainly deadens my tongue after each sip. I think after this beer i could drink horse blood and not notice a taste. (maybe not)  Overall such a great beer. I wish i could get this locally. seems like a perfect beer for any cold weather, can take place of any winter warmer or even barleywine, if you can handle the hops.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,PBRstreetgang,3.18,"Pours a very clear copper. The off-white two finger head is dense and creamy, holds up extremely well and leaves patches of sticky lace. The aromas of american hops are strong; citrus and grass with sweet malt and some fusels becoming more apparent as the head settles to a thin cap. Apple and orange esters visciously smacks your tastebuds first, then mellows out to a soft dark wheat flavor. Grassy hops then dominate the semi-dry aftertaste but never balance out the taste which is more overwhelmingly sweet than pleasently bitter. The body is medium and the tiny rushing carbonation tries to smooth the mouthfeel but the finish is almost more residual sweet than dry and bitter. Still a decent brew, but I can't say the D.I.P.A. style was well represented.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,sinistrsam,4.52,"Once agian, this is a prime example of one of my favs that I have yet to really rate objectively. So here is my attempt to be as objective as possible. A small white head sits atop this beautiful amber body. When it was brought to my table at the Flying Saucer in Raleigh, NC, I could smell it from several feet away. The retention was excellent, as was the lacing. Floral nose all the way. Hops and more hope, some serious sweet malts as well. If its possible to have a bitter smell, it has it. The taste was about the same, extremely intense hop floralness, malt and some sweet undertones. This is not for the faint of heart.

The smell consists of floral aromas along with pungent fruit, traces of pine essence, and a baked biscuit background. I keep backing off, so I can re-introduce the smell to my brain over and over. Very nice! The taste is more pronouced citrus fruit and pine that slowly reveals the malty backbone of fresh baked bread. This is a medium bodied beer that finishes bitter dry.  Notes: While the smell makes my mouth water, the citrus/piney taste wash it away. A very solid beer, but the 60 Minute is more for me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,LuckySkuff,4.65,"Truly one of the select few beers I'd label 'delicious' - a dangerously drinkable brew from good ol' Dogfish. The very label intrigued me.... I would have gotten it long before reading it's lavish praise on BA, had my store carried it before last week, from the little bit of description on the front (""What you have here..."").  It looked a little darker than most IPA's, a light ruby color, filtered to a clear and rich hue. A good bit of pearly white head at first, diminishes after about a minute to a nice thin froth that sticks at the side for a bit of decent lacing.  Smells like, well, hops. Reminds me of something someone said, negatively, about an IPA I made em try to the extent of, '...this smells like it could take the paint off the side of a barn'. Very sharp, tangy hop smell.  The taste is what the smell would lead you to expect, and much more. Spicy citrus and floral hops immediately ignite the tongue after the first taste, although it levels off after a moment to a semibitter dryness (lovely) after a few. The subtle malts become more apparent as you go along, providing a great counterbalance to the hop avalanche that is the essence of every sip. Easily poundable, it's very easy to let the ABV slip your mind and indulge in way too many. I myself drank my entire $9.00 four-pack the first night I tried 'em.  The mouthfeel is far from how thin most IPAs are, perhaps leaning towards medium-bodied. The malts provide a slight chewiness, which I like most about this IPA. Great feel to the mouth.  All in all a colossally drinkable beer. Absolutely friggin delicious, if you haven't tried it, please add it to your agenda. I am certainly not a hophead at this point in my career, but I found it marvelous.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Higravity,4,Well this is everyhting that a DIPA should be. The color is slightly dark amber color and gives up a white head that is hanging out. Smell is full of raw hops and has a hint of alcohol to mingle with the big malt sweetness sticking out.

Besides the 90, I have tried both the 60 and the 120 minute versions numerous times, but the 90 remains my favorite.  The first thing I ever noticed about this beer was it's delicious aroma. It has a sweet floral smell that is accentuated by a citris and hops, together, creating a unique aroma that is unmatched in my opinion.  The taste is just as dynamic. The extra alcohol in this IPA help balance the bitterness of hops, giving a unique fruity flavor that you don't normally find in highly hopped beer. It is not over done, however, which is what I feel about the 120.  Not only is this my favorite IPA, I would rank it in my top 5 favorite brews (at least at the moment) Unfortunately, however, I find it tastes much better on draught, but it is a rare find.

Taste is great. Malty balance up front with a nice bitter finish. However this one doesn't tweak the sides of my tongue like other IPAs or DIPAs tend to do. The alcohol is almost unoticable.  Mouthfeel is very smooth and oily. Carbonation doesn't bite and there is no lingering bitterness in the back of your throat.  This is a very drinkable DIPA to a fault.

10099,2093,nlmartin,4.67,This beer was poured into a pub glass.  Appearance: This beer is a very deep ruby almost bronze colored beer. The head was about an inch thick off white and had major staying power. Left a road map of lacing down the side of my glass.  Smell: This beer smells fantastic. There is tons of peppery spicy hops driving the smell of the beer. There are supporting citrusy smells coupled with the smell of a bakery. Oddly enough I smell definate sweetness to this beer.  Taste: This beer leads with bitter hops into a large amount of sweetness. There are citrus flavors playing with yeasty bready flavors. Like the smell there is also definate sweet components to the beer. I almost detect butterscotch in the beer.  Mouthfeel: The beer is meduim body with a very velvety buttery texture.  Drinkability: This beer is easy to drink inspite of 9% abv. Dam this is good and I wish I had much more. When I drank this beer about six months ago I absolutely hated this beer.

Mouthfeel: Somewhat slick and oily, carbonation just right.  Drinkabality: This is one of my favorite IIPAs'. Goes down way too easy. Nicely balanced IMO.

It hits the tongue with the typical Dogfish syrupy malt sweetness followed by fruity hops in the beggining, pine flavor in the middle, and then mild pine tar in the end. It hits with a good strong hop bite as it goes down, but the alcohol remains invisible. It leaves a nice fruity taste in the front of the mouth and a mild pine taste in the back.  It has a nice mouthfeel and it the easiest to drink double IPA I have had.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,SaCkErZ9,4.6,"Poured a bronze hue with a great looking head and lots of bubbles. Great lacing down the side of the glass as well.  A wonderful hoppy aroma greets the drinker. There is also notable malt tones as well, mainly caramel. Terrific citrus aromas and grassy notes. Very fragrant beer. Smells like an IPA....  The taste fits the bill as well. Very smooth. Crisp as well. Lots of grapefruits and hops. Very little hop bitterness which is nice. No alcohol taste either. Very very good balance with the alcohol and hops and malts.  A terrific IPA. The alcohol will sneak up on you without even knowing it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,jaluria,4.08,"A dark, burnt golden color with off-white head that clings to the glass leaving behind some lacing. Aromas of malt, hops, citrus, and alcohol seem to be present. The taste is flavorful with a hop profile that dominates despite the malt presence. Very similar in taste to the 60-minute IPA except the higher ABV and a slightly more bitter aftertaste. Crisp feeling in the back of my throat along with a warming alcohol sensation. A very enjoyable brew that goes down easy.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Ahhdball,4.57,"I had the sheer pleasure to have this at my favorite place to catch a pint - Old Bag of Nails, Worthington. I think it's become a staple. I know I have one every time I go in! Burnt orange color, fantastic sticky crown sat on top leaving excellent lacing after each pull. Huge hop aroma mixed with piney citrus and maybe a small amount of vanilla(?).... Alcohol, hops, and grapefruit open up the flavor. Following perfectly is a malt/molasses blend that feels like velvet. I love this brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,hopsaplenty,4.59,"Had this on draft at Brewings and Eats during their ""Hoppy hour"" and it was poured through the Randall.  A beautiful orange body with amber highlights, moderate white head that was gone in a flash. Almost no carbonation due to the Randall. The smell is all piney, sappy, hops. Delectable. The Randall strips the carbonation, but replaces it with a beautiful, slick coating of hop oil that coats every part of my mouth with pine and sap. The alcohol is sent to the back while the hops are up front, in the middle, and bringing up the rear. The malt is there somewhere, but it is tough to find. But this is not unbalanced, surprisingly.  Truly delectable for the hop lover. Randall makes 90 minute a special treat for those lucky enough to find it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,skynxnex,4.4,"A wonderful bright copper/orange with a white head. The smell is nearly all citrus and piney hops, with a bit of alcohol hiding behind the strong hops. Hints of leaves and grapefruit. For all the hops in the nose, the malt still can shine through. There are hops are throughout. Starting with the strong citrus feel ending with a nice bitterness mixing with the sweetness of the malt. Slightly bready, almost a slight hint of toastiness.  The mouthfeel is almost perfect. Good carbonation. It's amazingly drinkable for the level of hops and alcohol, but one is quite enough. Great beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,kingjames1,4.57,"Pours a beautiful copper-orange, with a short-lived head (the only weakness of this beer's appearance) that quickly dissolves to a consistent lace.  Interestingly I smell the roasted malts on this one as well as the pine-syrupy hops.  Taste is a wonderful combination of citrusy and pine (hops) bitterness, and sweet malts. This is a great (if somewhat aged) DIPA.  Mouthfeel is great, balancing the thickness of this brew and complexity with good carbonation.  Drinkable? Yes, but high on the abv side.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,pentathlete,4.25,"Pours a ruddy orange with a foamy head that leaves lace and a firm table. Smell is hops...and then more hops...pine, citrus rind, kind of scary. But the alarm bells were unwarranted. For a hop monster like this, it is shockingly smooth. While I never tasted ""malt"" per se, I did feel that something was holding the hops back from blistering my uvula. Mouthfeel was oily and full. Only suffers from such a high ABV and the serious damage that the hops do to the palate after a full bottle. Tasty. Have one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,warchez,2.84,"Apperance: the color of this beer is nearly orange. Very vibrant in color. Tan to yellow head with small bubbles, mild lacing occurs in glass. Great tight bubble streams in glass Aroma: I expected more from something dry hopped as intensly as indicated. Standard Pale Ale that is dryhopped has more hoppy aroma. Taste: sweeter than expected, thought the ""extreme hopping"" would make this appear dry. The huge malt bill overwhelms the palate. The new""hopping""technology lends alot of hop flavor but not so much bitterness as I would have expect. This is not a bitter beer. Even the hops come across as sweetness. Almost to sweet though, alcohol is present but not overwhelming although after half the glass you can feel it. Mouthfeel: softly syrup like. Coats and sticks in mouth, hops are mellow as part of the finish in throat. Very creamy with very slight crispness, needs more crispy tone. The sweetness lingers longer than it should. Overall: Fairly tasty, however it doens't reflect what one expects from a ""huge"" IPA. it is more ""imperial"" than IPA. I would lable this an imperial pale not an IPA. This doesn't live up to the BIG IPA hype.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,GeoffFromSJ,4.45,"Poured for me into a brandy snifter at Tria in Philadelphia. What an excellent beer. A beautiful color. Amber turning into ruby with hints of brown. Head there, but not too too much. Hops on full display but not bitter. The other hop qualities are on display here and this makes it quite drinkable , esp. relative to the alcohol percentage. Malt is noticeable. You want to get more so you can examine the hops in more detail.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Finishes dry for such a big beer. Mouthfeel: bubbles danced across my tongue. Full-bodied Drinkability: While I will truly enjoy this one, I won't run back to the fridge for another. That being said, this one is going down quitewell.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,NEhophead,3.9,"Foamy white head that slowly fades to a whispy sheet with pools of larger bubbles. Ringed and dimpled lacing with good strength. Glowing copper in color with a chill haze.  Juicy hop aroma; resiny. Pine and slick lemon notes. Noticeable whaffs of alcohol. Greawt aromatics for a hop lover.  Screaming, slick and oily hops right off the bat with a primary flavor of pine. Additional notes of bubblegum and grapefruit. An underlying 'cognac-like' sweetness that somehow does a decent job of balancing the strong hop intensity. A sharp bitterness followed by an alcohol-soaked aftertaste.  Medium bodied; very slick and oily feel on the palate, which is to be expected with a double IPA of this hop intensity.  This one is to be savored and enjoyed. It's an old standby for me, but definitely not a session double. Comparatively, it's not the most well-rounded version of teh style, but it's unique in its own right.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,SurgeonGeneral,4.53,"Serving temperature: 48F Serving glass: Tulip  Presenation: Typical DFH logo backed by a pile of hops. Explaination of the beer in here as well. No freshness date- while there is little worry of it spoiling, as always I'd like to know the vintage I'm drinking.  Aroma: The obvious is here. Grapefruit, lemon, citrus. Pine needles. It's already apparent, however, how much malt went into this brew. Sweet caramel scents backed by a bready character make their way up into my nostrils.  Appearance: Cloudy, copper/orange colored beer. Dense, rocky head forms well & stays at a high level. Supple, sappy, lacing all the way down the glass. Niiiice...  Taste: Alomst puckering citrusy tartness at first, mellowing out into the typical grapefruity hop profile. Intense bitterness follows, however, not to be outdone, a big sweetness shows up and says, ""Hi. My name is malted barley. Respect beer, damnit."" Very well balanced.  Mouthfeel: Big, sticky, full bodied. Real oily feel to it, yet finishes rather dry. Good carbonation.  Drinkability: 9% alcohol.. Hmmm. Where is this alcohol, again? Oh. There it is. I feel good.

10099,2093,Jcdolan,4.75,"4pack bottles  Poured into a cold mug (Boston Bruins Mug!)  Pours a nice dark rose gold, amber color. Nice thick off-white head that expires shortly after pouring.  Smells of HOPS! with a hint of pine in the background. Has a slight hint of caramel and malt as well. But mostly the delicious smell of hops.  Tastes of hops and pine. There is also a small floral taste that brings it all to gether aferwards and completes the taste perfectely.  I am a LOVER of IPA's and this is by far one of the most amazing if not best IPA's that I have every had. I would NEVER have guessed that this is a 9% ABV beer. I would recommend this beer to anyone who is a true lover of beers. I am just at a sheer loss of words for how good this beer really is.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Chadbrew,4.37,"There is good carbonation and pretty solid lacing right from the pour, very nice clarity. The aroma just screams heaviness - both hops and malt. Superb balance to this, Plenty of hops to get my fix yet a very solid malt backbone. The finish is puzzling because I'm used to finding one dominant characteristic, but not so here. Big ole body, oh yeah! So very drinkable, but at 9% slightly dangerous.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Ambundance of hop flavour, citrousy, yet slightly earthy as well, with a grassy aftertaste. A touch of raisin-bread malt flavour is hidden behind the hops.  M: Moderate body is slightly oily. Light to moderate carbonation.  D: It's quite bold, but most hop-heads should love it.  Thanks Len!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,lagrin,4.13,"Poured into a tulip style pint glass. Deep amber / rust color, beautiful, long lasting head that eventually dissipates into a tight cap of foam that leaves lacing all the way to the bottom of the glass.  Initial smell is of caramelized malt. The hop aroma comes later and builds but never overwhelms. The smell eventually morphs into a mixture of malt, warming alcohol and floral hops.  Taste is extremely balanced. Lots malt and hops that work together and neither takes an upper hand. The malt flavor marries with alcohol and fruity yeast by-products. The malt flavor is deeply caramelized. Tastes like a good proportion of crystal malt was used or even some non-traditional IPA malts like cara-munich. The beer hides the 9% abv well but there is something in there that reminds you that it must be respected.  Mouthfeel is substantial and fulfilling. As I swallow another sip, I again marvel how well balanced the beer is. I would classify the beer more as an English double IPA as the hops are more restrained and used in proportion with the malt. This isn't the hop bomb that I anticipated but is, nevertheless, a very well crafted and enjoyable ale.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Holyterror,4.62,"This is one of those beers that every hophead MUST drink at some point. There is no escaping it. From everthing I had heard, I expected greatness. But I was still surprised by this monster of a beer.  Poured an appetizing copper with a respectable, but not enormous, head. Big wave of floral hops at the nose. Crisp malt notes also tangible. Hard to explain, but it just smelled thick. And as soon as it hit my tongue, I knew why. This is heavy stuff. The rush of flavor is almost indescribable. But one stands out to anyone remotely familiar with the style: balance. This is very well balanced for a double IPA. I was ready for an all-out hop assault, and I wasn't disappointed with the hop presence, but the toasty malt backbone was also there in force. Double in every sense of the word. You gotta love anything this big that still goes down so smooth. But it's still heavy. After a couple pints of this, you'll feel like you just had a steak dinner. And that's really the only reason I wouldn't recommend making this a part of a hearty dinner. But it also wouldn't be a real shame to fill up on the 90 minute and put your steak in a doggie bag.  My verdict: buy some. Disappointment in unlikely. Drinking more is inevitable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,murrayswine,4.65,"If you are a true hop-head, than this is the Mecca of beers for you. This poured a golden amber range color with a slight head that relaxed into good lacing.

I bought it because I had friends over for chili, and I like a good pale ale with some good spicy chili. Had this one by myself afterwards. Going to buy a case of it tomorrow to always keep on hand.  Grassy, outdoorsy nose, and similar taste, VERY fresh tasting, tastes like late summer or some other bad analogy.  Literally the perfect DIPA (although now they're calling it 90 Minute Imperial IPA, don't know what brought around the switch). Hoppy, but not too bad, with a little taste of honey thrown in there just to keep you guessing. Refreshing, perfectly drinkable, the only reason it gets a 4.0 is because of the 9% abv. I just can't handle more than a few without getting drunk enough not to appreciate the taste of the beer.  All around wonderful beer from Dogfish Head.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

LOTS of hops in the nose.... a grassy, outdoorsy smells is there as well... very nice smelling DIPA.  I guess I could have mentioned this earlier in the review, but this is my favorite IPA.... placks plenty of hops in the taste without crossing the line to becoming overwhelming. There is almost a sweetness to this beer, but right before it reaches that point, the hops kick you in the tongue and bring you back to what this beer really is: a wonderful hoppy creation.  Mouthfeel is tart and tongue-spanking... I was going to try to review one or two other beers tonight, but I fear my taste-buds will be shot by the end of the glass.  Scary drinkable for a 9% brew... I much prefer this over the 60min, not that that's a bad brew either... this is just exceptional.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,battlekow,4.5,"On tap at the Landmark 1850. God, I love that place.  Anecdote: Dogfish Head 90 Min IPA was one of the first craft beers I tried, and it, along with Allagash White, really twisted my tongue. Much later, I came back to the formerly ""soapy"" Allagash White and loved it; now it's the 90 Minute's chance.  A pedestrian clear amber, but blessed with a wonderful fluffy, soapy white head and great lacing, the 90 Minute IPA is really attractive. It smells and tastes a lot like Anchor Liberty ale, I think--quite hoppy, yet with a strong sweet and creamy malt character for balance. Alcohol is a non-factor, hidden perfectly. A full, creamy mouthfeel rounds off what I recognize now to be an extremely tasty IPA, and a remarkably drinkable one given its ABV.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,miollnir,4.37,"Poured into a Chimay goblet. Just finished the last of a sixpack I bought a month ago.  Pours strong with less head then I expected. A nice deep brown color. No head to speak of on this particular pour, but have had nice pours in the past. Carbonization though is conisistant and lasts long enough for the finish.  Nutty, with lots of hops. Alcohol taste is a bit too strong for me, but the not strong enough to make the drink hard to swallow. Has an underlining oaky finish that with a buttery texture on the roof of the mouth creates an earthy warmed mouth. Rolls in the mouth pleasing the palate.  Over all a good beer, but Dogfish has a personal stigma that I've attached to it, where as I feel they are too modern of a brewery attempting to overwhelm with tastes and ABV percentages, leading to confusing and oft overpowering beers that just scream ""OVER DOING IT!!""  But this is definitely a nice beer and would recommend to anyone.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Golden2wenty1,4.88,"Picked up a single at Riley's here in Madison. Just getting into hoppy beers so I was a little intimidated by the lofty claims I've heard.  Pours a dark amber with a tall khaki head and the best lacing I've seen yet in a beer. Smell is insanely intense floral/herbal hops, some tropical fruit, and as it warms, malted barley. Taste starts with a strong hop kick, but not nearly as intense as I would have expected from the nose, considerably sweet caramel malts, and subtle pineapple/passionfruit notes. I can't believe how balanced they managed to make this beer with the ridiculous amount of hops they claim to throw in this stuff. This stuff really caught me by surprise. The hops and alcohol are immaculately balanced by an equally ridiculous amount of barley. This is really a treat.

Again a great spicy fresh aroma of citrus fruits and pine needles, some hints of malt and alcohol. Taste is actually quite sweet, surprised me, at the start before a tart fizzy bitterness takes over , very lemony,but in the background i taste alcohol which I should expect for a 9% beer but kinda spoils if a bit for me. MOuthfeel is alright and quite smooth to begin with, but after a few sips becomes cloying., I liked this ok but not the world class DIPA i thought it would be.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,GCBrewingCo,4.18,"The beer poured into the glass crystal clear amber golden with a barely off-white head that rose frothy, moussy and tall to fall slowly and coat the glass from top to bottom.  The aroma was nicely malty with caramel and a strong fruity presence with just slight bit of alcohol. The hop aromas were strong through the tall head and were citrusy and just very slightly earthy and at all times resinous.  The flavor was malty with a strong backbone of caramel which balanced a substantial, but not overpowering bittering aspect. The beer was almost balanced toward malt, but hop bittering and flavor won the day. The hop flavor was piney, floral and citrusy.  The finish was just dry with a nice lasting resinous citrus hop bittering that lasts long into the afteraste. The body was medium full to almost full. The citrus portion of the hop flavor and aroma was low and well mingled. The alcohol was very slightly present in the aroma, stronger in the flavor and strongest in the warming that came post consumption.  12 ounce bottle. Purchase a 4 pack at Brawley's in NC...heck yeah!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,RedwoodGeorge,2.26,"What a letdown in all phases! The beer pours a rather tepid golden brown with very little carbonation. No head to speak of and no lacing.  Aroma is dank. Not sure what hop they use but it's not one I recognize and not one I ever hope to come across again. Smell is somewhat like old socks or pumpkin - kind of a funky note pervades.  As is often the case, taste follows nose and the funk continues with each sip. Malt notes are present, primarily bready notes but the overwhelming taste is some sort of bitter sour rotten vegetable flavor. Very, very close to a diacetyl buttery note but not quite; I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if this was the offshoot of an unhappy yeast.  Mouthfeel is undercabonated and left an oily coating on the palate. Nothing to invite another sip other than the desperate hope that somehow magically the beer in my glass might have changed into something palatable.  All in all this rates a solid 'not impressed' This can't possibly be the same beer that most folk rate as 'outstanding'. I can only hope it's a bad batch that was somehow infected. Frankly, skunking would have improved the flavor.

Compared to where it stands statistically I have one word for it.... OVERRATED. Double IPA need nuts, this has small ones.  Slightly less attractive than your run of the mill IPA's , no deep colors, lacks any real characteristics. Did pour nicely and has decent head retention.

Visible carbonation.  The smell is just pure malt and hops. Almost like smelling pine trees on a rainy day. Quite a trip. Some bananas come in at the end of the smell.  Up front taste is sweet, almost like a cola. Has raisins and hints of clove. At the middle of the tongue it turns to a sweet banana sundae taste, with malt pushing it ahead. Finishes with a wonderful wash of hops that just fills your entire head with pine, citrusy, grapefruit like flavors, that stay for ages. The hops add tons of flavor to this brew, and not too much bitterness. A bit more hop presence up front would have sealed the deal for a ""5"" from me.  Mouthfeel is thin up front, crisp and carbonated near the end, and thin trails of alcohol and hops bitterness/sourness as you swallow. Not as big a feel as I'd expect, but definitely easy to swallow as a result.  This beer just pulls itself down your throat.

My wife, who absolutely loves a nice hoppy IPA didn't like and and passed it over to me. I tasted it and I too was disappointed, because I have had some of Dogfish Head's other IPA's in bottles and they were FANTASTIC.  So I don't know why this one didn't live up to our expectations. It smelled a bit yeasty and tasted a bit malty and didn't have the hop bite that I recall the bottles having.  Maybe the beer was stale or something.  Drinkability.

Aroma of good hops is prevalent, with juicy red apple and spicy clove on top of the nutty barley malt. This ale is a masterpiece - a ludicrous amount of hops is perfectly balanced by tons of barley malt, making for a exquisitely tasty IPA. Not too bitter, but bitter enough to be just perfect. Mouthfeel is smooth and buttery, a little low on the carbonation side, but that makes it more authentic. An excellent ale if you're in the mood for something hoppy, but it's 9% ABV doesn't lend to drinking a whole 4-pack of these.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Melchizedek,3.85,"Pours slightly bronzed clear tan, with perfect clarity, a little lighter than I'd anticipated. Head is off-white, good-sized and pretty well immortal. The aroma is predictably hoppy, although the sweeter side of the brew comes through with a bit of a woody, caramel-and-spice scent. The alcohol is noticeable as well.  In the mouth, it flows nicely, medium-bodied and not too sticky--""juicy"" wouldn't be a bad description. Hops are strong but don't dominate, and most of what I notice is really the sweetness of the malt and alcohol. The overall effect is sort of caramel-appleish, with a drying finish that has some nutty character to it. Carbonation is minimal, appropriate to the flavor.  I'm just not that much of a big-beer fan, and from the bottle (uncellared) I find the alcohol a bit much for my tastes. I wouldn't drink more than one at once, but the complexity makes it a good meditation beer. I've had it on-tap as well and felt that the alcohol wasn't so aggressive, which I appreciated. In any case, I'd say it makes an excellent session closer, a good change of pace if you've been knocking back hoppier stuff.  +",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Palate- Rich and mouthfilling, but the hops keep it from being the least bit cloying. Notes of grapefruit marmalade. Smooth dark brown sugar flavors (this reminds me a bit of a barleywine, but in an IPA package. Perfect balance, and a long finish.

Dry aroma of spicy fresh hops, orange peel, ale yeast, and a touch of mustiness. The palate is...I don't know how to say. ""One of the most pleasing things that has ever caressed my tongue"" doesn't really convey it. A smooth, creamy, slightly buttery body holds a huge hop presence up front, redolent with lupulin.

Decent light brown head, not as massive head as expected. Nice piney hop smell. Wow a smooth clean hop and sweet malt taste, can tell this one is higher alcohol. First sip was great, but the power and sweetness caught up with me. This is definitely a sipping beer.

It's balanced by a riduculous amount of English two-row barley. Then we dry-hop it in every tank."" Ok, so...pours up a cloudy, lovely apricot color with a tight head of foam, stays around for the entire beer and leaves great lace down the glass. Smells of flower, sunny and wonderful, some sweet fruit as well. Taste is amazing, I thought the 60-min. IPA was the winner, but this is the stuff. Hops to give, a touch of sweet fruit in the mouth, some bread taste, but flowery hops everywhere. An amazing beer. Finishes brilliantly, crisp with bite, and could be drank all night, even at 9% ABV.

10099,2093,Bumpon10s,4.38,"I've had this a few times in bottle, and tried on tap, and figured I was due for a review of this bad boy.  A - Pours off very thick, very little head due to thickness with large amounts of lacing however.  S - Actually not very heavy on the nose, I gave it swirl and a big sniff and didn't get much outside of hops.  T - Deep and bitter hops, not picking up anything in the way of floral or citrusy notes, just biting hops. There is a touch of alcohol, but you wouldn't guess at 9%, well hid by the hops.  M - Very thick and little on the carbonation makes it very smooth, slides right down the hatch.  D - This is a VERY drinkable Imperial IPA, but you can't quite grant it perfect for it's 9% ABV.

Plenty of fruit flavor, biscuity malts, and pine like hoppy flavor. Sweet alcoholic back ground and finishes dry. Fruitiness lingers for a bit on the tongue. Great drinkablity and very potent.

10099,2093,hyuga,4.5,"In my snifter is a jolly rancher orange brew with an off-white head, which given a few moments will become a suitable ring, leaving lace down the sides of the glass. Great looking brew.  Massive citrusy hops combine with raisin bourbon and a hint of alcoholic cherry in the aroma. Perhaps a bit grainy. Sweeter as it warms. Unexpected and very interesting.  Initially hop-bitter, a bit leafy, leading into a surprisingly more fruity malt-sweet middle with hops taking their place around the edges. Alcoholic burn all around, with burny hops to complement it. Finishes on the sweet and malty side right after a hit from the hops. A bit grainy on the breathe-out.  Crisp and pleasantly rough, yet smooth at the same time. Great carbonation.  Certainly ""off-centered"" as the Dogfish Head motto suggests, and in a good way. This is the best east coast IPA I've had! It'll be a regular in my refrigerator. You have to try this one in a snifter or maybe an oversized wine glass, a regular pint glass just doesn't do it justice.

Pours a golden color with a decent head that slowly fades away to a small cap with some pretty decent lacing.  Smells is citrus, pine, hops and malt. Not as overwhelming as I expected. This is my first double IPA, and I was expecting a stronger assault on the nose.  Taste is initially citrus and hops, but finishes with a nice malt sweetness to it. It's smoother and has a lot more balance than I was expecting. I find that I have to force myself to not drink this to quickly.

10099,2093,SSGPat,4.92,"OK. I went and bought at the brew store today (Brawley's). I spent too much, but finally was able to find this Dogfish Head IPA that was supposed to be the best. I have not opened the bottle yet, but the anticipation is incredible.  Appearance: Poured really nice, although there was little head and not a ton of bubbles. Beautiful golden color. The head clears out except for a small ammount of lace that graces the top of the beer.  Smell (nose): Hops. Not as overwhelming as I would have thought from a DOUBLE IPA (but never having a double before, my expectations could be skewed). They also hide the alcohol from the nose.  Taste: I took one sip and immediatly had to go back for another before I could continue typing. Very hoppy, which makes me very happy! Well hopped, as one would expect from a DOUBLE IPA... about double the wondrous hops! Most excellant. If you don't love hops, do not try this beer, it's not for you. If I hadn't read on the bottle that it was 9% abv, I would not have know from the taste and the nose.  Mouthfeel: This is a BIG-BOY! Feels like once the beer enters your mouth that it will not hide or cower! Big and bold and holds nothing back.  Drinkability: The problem with this beer is that it will not leave you alone. You want more in your mouth. I am finding that I don't want to type, just drink more of this elixor vitea.  Belch (every good beer has a good belch, and I believe that you taste more of the hops in the belch): I was not let down in this area either. I good belch to me is one that tastes as you would think putting a hop flower into your mouth would taste.

Great flavor! Grapefruit/citrus, malt, and lots of hop flavor, (of course). Slght warming and astringency from the alcohol content, but I don't think it's a bad thing in this case.  Overall, I find this excellent and very drinkable.

10099,2093,Dubblebock,4.43,"The Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA may well be the most balanced and subtle IPA that I have ever tasted. DFH has been bringing their creations into the Texas market for a while now, and the 90 Minute IPA was one of the original beers that they entered into retail here. It is, along with the 60 Minute IPA, one of their flagship beers. My only quibble with it at all is the pricing. At $8.49/4-pack, it can take a bite out of the beer budget. That said, it's hard to argue that it isn't worth the price, as this beer certainly rocks.  The 90 Minute IPA starts with a very pretty pour. It has a deep orange-amber coloring, and the head is thick and creamy on the pour. The foam eventually dissipates, leaving nice, thick lacing down the mug or glass as the beer is quaffed. The nose is malty and hoppy, slightly sweet.  The taste is exceptionally well-balanced. The malts are sweet and bready, and they provide the perfect counterbalance to the heavy hop infusion. Incredibly impressive. There were some complex nuances to the taste as I worked my way through the beer. Vanilla, lavender, and rose petal tastes surfaced once in a while. Very interesting all the way around. I have never had an IPA (or any other beer) quite like it before.  Good mouthfeel, just short of being sweetly cloying. Very drinkable considering the ABV. It's a big beer, but I could see enjoying several of these in succession if I knew that I didn't have to drive or otherwise be occupied with anything other than enjoying this fine brew.  I was really expecting something different. I had tried the 60 Minute and just expected more of the same with a bigger hop bite. But the 90 Minute really shattered my vague expectations. There really isn't anything like it out there. DFH has produced a unique masterpiece with this beer, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for something out of the ordinary.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,kgotcher,3.48,"12oz 4 pack at my local grocer.  This is my last of the 4 drank at a rate of 1 per week. The first one I could hardly stand and they got better from there. I decided I would review the last one to be fair.  Pours a copper color with a typical IPA head, forthy and lacy.  Smell is not your typical IPA. Not what you expect. Normally I am looking for a bit more citrus/grapefruit smell. Hops are there in abundance just a deeper complex level of hops than the typical aromatic citrus hops smell. Smoky, sour, fuity, citrus. piney, it all seems to be in there somewhere, a blend of hops if you will. Mouthfeel is warm (probably all the alchohol) and creamy.  Taste is tangy and bitter, very bitter and then malty. This one may be beyond my abilities to actually get at all the flavors. Malt is strong as well, buscuit malts but really the bitter hops take over the taste.  Frankly a strong and interesting beer but not an extremely drinkable beer (my lowest score). This is one left to the BA type. Not one to try out on friends used to drinking macros or typical micros. However it DOES grow on you. This last one is much more enjoyable than the first one. A beautiful beer in its element but otherwise a beast that most people would have trouble understanding.  And this from a hop head and IPA lover.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,neonbrown82,3.96,"I was glad to finally try this beer, but I must say I was a little bit disappointed. I think the 60 minute has been my favorite DFH so far, aside from the Burton Baton. This wasn't far off from the 60 minute, but I was hoping it would be the perfect balance between the 60 and the 120, which is doesn't seem to be.  Pours to a dark coppery clear red with a nice inch foam and a decent carbonation. Looks like it will be quite a treat.  The smell is piney hoppy and has the weird yeasty aroma that I seem to equate to cinammon and apple sauce. Not quite as aromatic as I was hoping, and not even any more potent to the nose than the 60 minute.  The taste is actually quite sweet, and the hops don't seem to have any more oomph than the 60 minute. DFH uses some funky fermentables, as is apparent in their larger proof beers. Tastes like they used a shit ton of honey, molasses, cinnamon, and brown sugar. This beer seems to be more sweet and sour than it is bitter. Not as big of a disappointment as the 120 minute, but doesn't live up to my expectations of when I was stuck only being able to get the 60 minute here in Iowa.  The mouthfeel is syrupy and coating, though not too thick considering how much it tastes like honey and molasses. Has a contact dryness from the astringency of the alcohol as well as the hops. Evidently the hops are there, but they are hiding behind the attempt at balancing the bitter out with some sweet. It is too overwhelming to be drinkable. I love my IPA's, and I love it when brewers get a bit experimental with their recipes, but nothing can come close to the refreshing taste of a more ""traditional"" American IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,UncleFlip,4.55,"Nice two-finger off white head....foamy, small bubbles, but broken up by some large ones. Head slowly decreases in size, leaving some lacing behind. Beautiful honey colour underneath, with no bubbles rising.  The smell is all hops (would you expect anything else from this one?), with a subtle but present maltiness underneath. Somewhere in here, there's even some fruitiness- mainly a pungent orange, and a bit of grapefruit.  Wow....strong maltiness hits on first taste. I expected the hops to hit hardest, but they don't. The grapefruit is there along with some spiciness, and the alcohol doesn't back down. Oddly, a woodiness comes in at the end, instead of the hops. Very nice.  The mouthfeel is thick, With a low somewhat loose carbonation that hits up front, builds a bit, then is gone.  Some folks might find a 9% a bit too strong for a session beer, but this one could fit the bill well. It not so strong that it would put you off after a while- but has enough going on in the flavour, to keep you interested.

Aroma is big, juicy hops; citrus (mainly grapefruit with hints of lemon and orange rind) and a slight piney smell as well as a lightly sweet caramel background. The flavor begins with a nice juicy hops profile with big citrusy grapefruit, slightly floral and mineraly, piney, and herbal flavors, followed by sweet caramel and lightly bready malt character to balance. The finish is drying and fairly bitter, but less so than your typical DIPA which makes it all the more drinkable. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with a big body and the drinkability is pretty good ( i can only think of one other DIPA more drinkable...thank you Stoudt's), alcohol is noticeable but not intrusive and this is one of the few DIPA's I could drink more than one of in a session...very nice beer by DFH",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Nice grassy, herbal, green hops with an intensity that's very powerful and remains through the whole glass. Enough somewhat sweet malt presence that forms a sturdy and steady background (Maris Otis?). Golden amber with orange/red. Very slow building head that eventually builds to a solid one inch of dense off-white and then slowly dies. Heavy lacing. Both malt and hops present boldly from start to finish (with each drink and in the whole glass full). I really like how neither dominates or overwhelms the other and that both remain present throughout the drink. Malt flavors are heavy and not especially sweet. Hops are bitter with a resin and a slight grassiness. Very heavy and chewy with a dense carbonation that lends a creaminess. Still a bite from bitterness. Warmth from alcohol. I like the lack of American style hops, which offers a different version for this style.

Taste is definitely mostly delicious spicy hops but there is also a lot of sweet malt here which tries to balance it out, but fails. The effort of the malt does not go unappreciated however- it results in a nice sweetness underneath all those wonderful hops.

The taste has a great blend of malty sweetness and spicey hop bitterness. It's absolutely delicious. The alcohol is definately present and it gives the beer a nice warming experiance after every sip. This is a good swishing beer.  The mouthfeel is great. It coats the mouth nicely letting you get the full effect of the malt and hop addition. This is a full bodied beer with moderate carbonation.

The beer pours with a thick dark amber-red body and a nice frothy head and rich bubbles. The smell is phenomenal, being freshly hopped, with very nice fruity and floral hops notes, some citrus, an almost menthol hops not (but not unpleasant), and a hint of malt.  Despite the high IBUs of this beer, and the dry hopping right before serving, this beer isn't as powerful as you'd think in the hops department. The floral and citrus tastes of the hops are very strong, but in more of a fruity than a bitter way. Think bitter orange and you're getting the idea. Night maltiness and a slightly dry but substantial body round this out.  This is not my favorite double IPA, but it's close, and it's very, very pleasant.

Nice show  Smells great, smells like snickerdoodle dough, pineapples, grapefruit pith and lemon ice cream.  this doesn't blow your doors off, it knocks with assurance and walks right into the parlor, and sits down to make a deal. The deal is this: After a couple of buttery scones with lemon curd and fresh cream we're gonna dance around a bowl of mixed greens with orange vinegarette, and mandarin orange garnish.

This isn't your run of the mill IPA or double IPA, this beer packs some serious hop punch. The 120 minute is even hoppier, which boggles the mind. Pours a deep copper, nice dense head. Intense floral hop aromas, there's no mistaking what this beer is. Taste is frighteningly hoppy yet smooth, with a huge kick in the end. Mouthfeel is creamy yet almost harsh at the same time.

Pours a pale gold with a nice finger of head but doesn't lace too well or retain its head that great. You can smell this beer from across the room- smells like spice and smoke with intense herbal hoppiness. Tastes the same with an addition of some malty thickness in the far background- I actually described this to someone as tasting somewhat like smoked ham. Has a really nice medium body to it- not so watery like some IPAs. I think this and the Great Divide have claim to the quintessential double IPA,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,SkeeterHawk,4.37,"Appearance: Pours a clear golden color with a slight reddish tint to it. It has about 1/4 inch of foam at first pour that slowly faded to a thick ring around the glass. There are few bubbles rising to retain the head. Thick Belgian lace left behind after tasting.  Aroma: Super fresh and citrusy. I get green apples and grapefruit mixed with a bit of lemon at first pour. There is a tad of caramel coming out as it warms up a bit.  Taste: The taste is totally refreshing, and this is coming from a person that normally doesn't like hoppy beers much. The taste starts out with the citrus in the hops leading the profile, but then the malt kicks in to help lead the finish toward the sweet side of the finish. I guess that is a true statement, because the mouthfeel is really resiny, so I am making an assumption that it is based on malt. This might be pure hop essential oil that I am tasting coat my throat...and in this case it would be a hoppy finish. Either way, you get hops in the beginning, and a sweet and slick finish.  Opinion: This is a very well crafted beer! It is easily a contender with the best of them...in it's own category the way it reacts with your senses is unique, much like a Berliner Weisse. This beer over-utilizes the hop presence like a Berliner Weisse over-utilizes the tart character from it's fermentation.

Bottle obtained from a local liquor store and consumed a couple evenings later. Pours thick and silent. Not a sound. Almost no head forms, just a ring around the inside of the glass. The beer itself is a nearly clear rust-orange. Smells mild compared to what I expected. Malty sweet with some citrusy hops and fruity esters (pumpkin, apricot, peach). Some pine aroma upon later sniffs. Tastes really malty smooth with noticable hop orange and some grapefruit pith flavor. An alcohol sting hides behind hop clouds, partly successful because fruity esters tease my tastebuds as a distraction. Nectarine and apricot ride both a volatile aromatic and a clingy oil. Hop bitter comes across as low, as does co-ho hop roughness, but the beer is thick and sugary sweet...I think these hop characteristics have simply been kept in check by equally bold malt. Thick and smooth moutfeel and mildly carbonated. This beer is wonderful.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,ColForbin,4.15,"It's hard to believe I haven't reviewed this beer before. I'm drinking one of a 4-pack of 12 oz bottles - do they make the 750ml corked version anymore? 90 Minute IPA pours a deep golden color with a hint of red and a white head that quickly fades to a lacing on the glass. Aroma is full of citrusy hop goodness, with a healthy dose of pine thrown in for good measure. Taste is all hops, all the time, with just enough malt to give a slight toasted flavor and a medium to full body. Carbonation is light. This is a delicious double IPA, and I'm glad that I know a place to get it in NH now (even if it is an hour away).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,bubrewer,4.44,"Great aroma on initial pour of this pale copper ale. Pine and grapefruit come to mind from the aroma. Bitterness is truly excellent - round and full and strong, not sharp like many other highly hopped beers. Hop flavor is very good - it's not all about the bitterness. Finish is sweet - likely a highish terminal gravity on this beer, but the robust bitterness requires it.  Well balanced, well liked, recommended.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,sinistermadman,4.57,"Pours a crystal clear golden color emanating a superb burly white head. Nice lacing left after each drink.  Smell: Piney, sweet and all around delicious smelling.  Mouthfeel is quite good. Very smooth, almost creamy in it's body. Hop bitterness is obviously evident but is coupled well with the malts to obtain an almost sweet finish. This is a very quenching brew. Hops resonate in all their oily glory. Insanely drinkable for a 9% IPA, this could easily become a regular in my session lineup. Packaging boasts that this is America's best IPA. Whether or not that is true is to be determined, but this is an excellent example of the style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,jhu1995,3.35,"Had a 12 oz bottle which was poured into a pint glass. Poured a nice, very clear orange, copper color. Head faded quickly but had excellent lacing. The hops aroma was extremely intense, but in a good way. Had a woody aroma with slight citrus notes. I thought the taste came off a bit harsh initially but smoothed out over time. It tasted very crisp, clean, and refreshing but the overwhelming hop flavor may not be for everyone.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,ViveLaChouffe,4.35,"Pours a slightly hazy yellow-gold with a creamy eggshell colored head. Head is dense and frothy. Thick sheeting lace. Smells of...hops. Bitter and citrusy, orange rind.  Taste is variations on the first sip. Goes something like this: hoppy burn, alcohol burn, sticky rich malt. Rinse. Repeat. OK the alcohol burn is understated and slow to build which actually make it quite warming in the gullet. The hops are an explosion and actually burn the tongue a bit like a good habenero sauce would. There is some citrus in there but mostly bitingly bitter herbal hop flavors. The malt is rich and sweet, molasses, burnt caramel and such. Mouth is sticky, the hops for all their glory do tend to get washed on the tongue by the considerable malt but do linger on the roof of the mouth forever. And your teeth. Great stuff, did this one right they did.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Pours a pretty clear light orange with a one finger head of sticky, off-white foam. Great lacing all the way down the glass. Slight carbonation evident.  Aroma is piney/ herbal, with a little citrus thrown in to boot. Chewy carrot cake like malt, toasty and caramel-y. Aroma is more subtle than I was expecting.  Flavor is a luscious, creamy toffee malt base crammed on top of a big but not too big bitterness. Pine needles, hay, fruity esters abound in this one. For everything that's in here, it's absolutely balanced. The 9% ABV is very well hidden. Barely noticeable at all. Aftertaste is pine needles and herbal cookie dough.  Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and creamy. Carbonation is soft. This is like a mouthfull of heaven. Lip smacking sweetness coupled with hop bitterness grabbing the back of your throat. Finish is sweet/bitter. Just a hint of heat. Awesome!  This is one of the better DIPA's I've ever had. Not as hoppy as Three Floyd's Dreadnaught, but very well balanced, and awesome in its own way.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The flavor starts out with a sweet malty presence then smacks you in the taste buds with hops. The finish is quite bitter from the blast of hops (with hints of citrus).

This is one of the most complex IPA's I've ever tasted. Just so much going on it's hard to describe. Most noticable is citrus; not as heavy as Alpha King, but definately there. Mouthfeel is wonderful, smooth and slippery. Aftertaste is great too, your tongue is alive with the complex combination of malt and hop.  This is worth the price.

Nice soft white frothy head...very nice retention. leaves some legs on the glass.  Smell...not surprisingly it smells of hops..also citrus.  Taste...this is a delicious beer. Hoppy like you would expect, very citrusy, but not overly acidic. Orange peel and lemon citrus....also some other fruity phenolic flavors. Nice malty balance.  Mouthfeel...Nice full body, not overly alcoholic for a 9%.  Drinkability...the 9% makes this a tough session beer. Even still, I would drink 4 of these and be one happy dude.  I give the 90 minute Imperial IPA my best score ever. Pick up a 4 pack of these and you will not regret it.

Upon opening the bottle it get stone fruit from the noise mostly apricot, but an entire sweet aroma is there. The head is thin and fades pretty fast but being an IPA I dont expect much of one. The biggest thing to me though is I can feel the care that went into this brew.

I let this beer sit for a minute to bring out more flavor and aroma, and as I put it back to my nose more floural and spicey aromas became present. As I tasted this beer I let the beer sit on my palate and so many delicious flavors came to mind, a smoothe, malty, hoppy finish. The taste is carmalized fruits, grape, peaches, caramel, and kick of hops. You can't even taste the 9% abv.

Hops explode onto my palate with a bittersweet blend of tangerine and grapefruit, pine, honey, light caramel, and seared brown sugar. It leaves my lips feeling sticky ands slightly sweet.

Definate caramel malt in the aroma, a bit of toasty bread too (what kind of mash do they use?) and some grassy, slightly spicey hops.  As it hits my mouth it's syrupy smooth with minor hop flavors attached through every moment of taste impression. The same grassy, slightly spicey, slightly floral hops that make up part of the aroma permeate the entire duration of the flavor profile. Toasty malt syrup melded with floral hops? Perhaps a bit of tannic harshness in the very back, barely perceptible - I guess that's what you get from such a long hop boil. Interesting... Overall, very low hop bitterness for a DIPA, and actually low hop flavor and aroma too, but the flavor and aroma are so expertly intertwined with the malt flavors that I can't deny that this is an excellent beer. It's just one that is so different from the standard DIPA that I've grown used to.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Romulus141,4.65,"This beer has a very nice color to it. A medium amber that glows in the light. It pours with little to no head, and it delicately sticks to the glass that it resides in. The viscosity looks hearty.  The smell is pleasant and fruity.  The taste has two stages to it. The first stage is a semi-sweet stage, in which you notice that it is thick and syrupy. However, the thickness is not intrusive, and adds character to the beverage. The beer slides down the throat comfortably. The aftertaste is slightly bitter, but not in a bad way. The aftertaste does not linger long.  This is a beer that tastes better when it is NOT ice cold. If the beverage is excessively cold, the sweet taste is obscured and the bitter taste is emphasized. Be mindful of the drink's temperature before you consume.  All in all, this is a very enjoyable beer, and is a great after-dinner dessert beverage. It is thick, and something that one can sit and savor.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Beautifully balanced taste with the hops being prevalent but not overwhelming. Smooth, luscious mouthfeel, just right. The alcohol is really hidden well in this beer.

Definate bittering hops and added spices consequently. Mouth watering to tge smell. Mild tones of ethynol for a high alcoholic beer.  Appearance: Deep coppers, oranges, rust, and browns. Just off from clear (always makes things interesting). Nice off white head rose to about and inch and remained. Medium dense head that laced well. Also a nice cling to the glass as I swirled it around.  Taste: An aggressive blend of malts and hops. Very powering imediately. Malts pick up a lot of caramels, coconuts, other nuts, hints of brown sugar and deep fruits (figs?). Spiced up from multiple varieties of hops--fused well into the malts. Full and rich through the body, releasing multiple flavors as it crosses the palate. Picking up the bittering hops, spices, and citrus at it travels. Finishes full and moist. Most definately alcoholic. Polishes the palate very well.  Aftertaste: delicate balance of lingering malts, hops, and spice. Also develops over the course of a few minutes. Not terribly dry for a 9%er.  Impression: A well balanced, well aged IIPA. Very complex and satisfying. There is a flavor in there for all beer lovers. One worth stocking the frige with.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,blackie,4.55,"appearance: Pours into the glass forming a thin white head. Color is a dark golden amber getting lighter around the edges. Label notching indicates that this beer was bottled on the twelfth month of the bottling year.  smell: Smells sweet! The malt and hop aromas are extremely well balanced, allowing me to easily differentiate them, yet mixing together to form a great aroma. Notes of plum, sweet cereal, grain, floral and piney hops. There is an earthiness and woodiness that suggest a VERY light coffee scent; this may be partially a result of the acidic nature of the hops.  mouthfeel: Carbonation is somewhat light, and body is medium to medium heavy.  taste: There is alot going on here. The initial flavors of sweet malt joined with an enjoyable hop flavor yield to a considerable hop bitterness. Plenty of maltiness and plenty of hops. Somewhat vinous in character, kind of like a barleywine, becoming even moreso as the liquid warms. Finishes with a smooth sweet feel overshadowed by a tasty bitterness. The hops seem to have an additive effect as far as the bitterness felt, becoming more bitter in the finish as the glass is slowly drained.  The 9.0% ABV is very well hidden.

Slight alcoholic note underneath.  The taste follows the nose with the malts upfront giving way to juicy hops, but the alcohol is well hidden. I get the impression of an aged barley wine that has been treated well. This is one hell of a craft beer.  The mouthfeel is full, but not oily or chewy.

Citrus & pine hops dominate with some sweet malt and darker fruit undertones. The taste is expectedly very hoppy (herbal and citrus), but surprisingly malty and sweet towards the end. The aftertaste...yikes...is a bitter pine taste that lingers for quite awhile. Seriously, seems like I just licked one of those pine air freshners you see in cabs.

Chewy and rich, this beer tastes like it could be a meal. Not as bitter as I thought it would be, less so than the 60 min? Sweet and candi like at the begining, the hop flavor kicks in takes over.

Sturdier in the hop than the 60 minute, but not to the point of being sticky and cloying like the 120 minute, this ale holds together well through the sip and trip down the gullet, with a strong grapefruit hop start and finish. There is balance as well, and before the hop finish, the two-row malt asserts itself, making for a balanced brew.

Smell was juicy citrus and sharp pine, straw, alcohol, pepper-like spiciness, and a light metallic wang.  Smooth body with light carbonation. Hops are the main attraction, they start citric, go piney, and meet up with a wallop of alcohol in the finish. Malts don't get lost, though, and add body and flavor up to the finish. Alcohol is strong in the back, and is the one component that doesn't meld.  After the 60 Minute (which I was disappointed in) I can't say I had high expectations, but this was pretty dammed good.

Smell was citrus and floral, with a sweetness not characteristic of other double IPA's I've consumed.  Mouthfeel was very good, thick in a good way. As for taste, this beer does not disappoint. Good malt,and great bitter citrus offset by sweetness approaching honey. Hops from beginning to end, but not presented in an ""in your face"" way. Finish is truly bittersweet, the hops maybe just barely winning out, but not the desire to have another sip. Complex in a very good way.

Strong tropical aroma - oranges, grapefruit, and pineapple, along with biscuits and piney/leafy/herbal hops (I can almost smell the bitterness). By the end of the beer there are notes of caramel and bananas. The first sip shows a sweetness up front followed by a barrage of hops. Well balanced - doesn't seem like 90 IBUs. The flavors are the same as the aroma - even the caramel and banana finish. It is full bodied and the flavors linger on the palate forever (I'm having pine and grapefruit burps).

High alcohol, make it the last of a session. I don't get too crazy for many of Dogfish Head beers (Got some Burton Baton Waiting 10 years! YES!), but between this and the sixty, no contest. Go for the 90, cheap bastard!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,arguemaniac,4.37,"Appearance: A foamy white head with decent retention. A slightly cloudy orange/amber color.  Aroma: A pungent floral hop aroma with exceptional complexity; there is some pine, some lemon citrus, etc. The malt aroma is comparatively mild, but there is a definite malty sweetness.  Taste and Mouthfeel: Wow, intense and spicy hop flavor, a very complex bitterness; flowery, piney, citrus sourness, fruitiness and even a very subtle cinnamon flavor. Still, there is a nice malty backbone, with a somewhat sugary sweetness that balances quite well. A mild alcohol bite, too. Very, very smooth mouthfeel (a bit oily) with moderate carbonation.  Simply exceptional. Im not particularly crazy about IPAs, especially Double IPAs, but this one is just amazing. Most American Double IPAs are intensely hoppy and bitter, but lack a malty balance. Not with this beer; the rich malty sweetness and the intense hop flavor of this brew make it a real treat, not to mention the smooth mouthfeel. Delicious and flavorful. Highly recommended!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,ski271,4.5,"Appearance: the orange side amber with a medium-sized, slightly off-white, creamy head that diminished rapidly down to a stubborn film. Attractive rings of lacing half way down.  Smell: All about the hops... well almost all. A wonderful leafy hop aroma, citrus and pine. Also a hint of clove in there.  Taste: Again the hops are most noteworthy (what did you expect, its a Double IPA, duh!). Wonderful big hop flavor, thick with hop oils and grapefruit... But theres a nice malt backbone that shows itself in the middle (along with a touch of honey) but then gets overtaken again by the hops on the long, bitter finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium body, oily to dry texture, soft carbonation  Drinkability: Hop heads will get there fix here! Marvelously bitey. Anymore kick to it and I think it would detract from the overall experience by wearing out your taste buds. Excellent beer that I recommend to all beer lovers that like the hoppy stuff.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,HogHill,4.02,"I poured this single 12oz. bottle into my Stone IPA glass. It is amber and is very transparent, a little bit of off white froth makes up the head. The aroma is Alpha acids up the yin yang, err my nose-yang. This tastes heavily of hops obviously! Like a carbonated pine tree tea with some grapefruit squeezed in. The high ABV warm this one up on the finish. Feels bubbly a good dose of carbonation / medium bodied on the tongue. I'm all set after about one of these because they are so rich (in hops) and intense. I like my IPAs a little less in your palette, and a little bit lower in ABV. This is more of a treat, kinda like a candy apple.  Overall: I enjoyed this DFH beer as they put quality and interesting brews, but by no means is it my favorite IPA. I prefer the 60 minute, and for now will stay away from the 120.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,PhillyMonk,4.44,"If you're into hoppy IPAs, you won't be disappointed with this brew. Pours amber with a 1/2 inch or so of creamy white head, and smells exactly like it should: clean, fresh, and hoppy. Slight malty taste at first, but is quickly overwhelmed by smooth hoppy bitterness. Fresh, bitter aftertaste lingers for some time, so you can truly sip this beer over some time. Although alcohol content is high, it is well-masked by this beer's flavor.  This beer is a nice treat if you're a fan of hoppy IPAs/""double IPAs"" and don't mind shelling out $9 for four of them once in a while. Definitely a step up from the ""60-minute"" version.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Wow. It is slightly balanced with some malt presence, but it's more leaning toward the hops for sure. Mouthfeel is slightly thick for style. This is a good one, prehaps the best american example of a DIPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,EPseja,4.62,"One of the first few pints from a fresh keg at Firewaters in Hackensack, NJ.  Appearance: Copper gold, completely clear. Frothy, marshmallowy head that clings for dear life to the glass throughout the pint. Beautiful presentation.  Smell: Everything wonderful about hops is contained in the bold nose of this beer! Summer orange blossoms, grapefruity citrus, rugged pine undertones; sweet and inviting. Big time west coast flair. The only ""bad thing"" about this beer's scent is the fact that it keeps me from taking a sip because I can't stop smelling it! I do not hand out 5s lightly, but this beer deserves it for this category.  Taste: If hops could be concentrated and squeezed to produce a sweet nectar, this is what you'd get. Sweet and citrusy up front, round and syrupy in the middle without being thick. Slight clover honey. Flowers. Delicious.  Mouthfeel: Slick and smooth with a rolling sea-foamy feel like an ocean wave retreating from the beach.  Drinkability: Very easy to drink. The sweetness isn't cloying. The hoppiness isn't bitter. Every sip leaves you wanting another - if you can quit smelling it and get your nose out of the glass!  My quote of the lunchtime tasting session: ""It's like getting flogged with a cat o' nine tails tipped with hops.""",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,SaunaKing,4.37,"a murky, dirty orange. Nice head with a tan/cream colour and nice density.  Beautiful fruity citrus aroma of hops. Fresh and ripe.  My first impression is that the aste is a little dull and quite a disapointment compared to the appearance and aroma. Malt is much more present in the taste than the aromas. Has a little bit of an alcohol burn. A few more sips and I can appreciate the taste. A very nice tasting beer, the hops are well balanced with the sweetness of the malt.  Mouthfeel is harsh and acidic, with the hops giving the beer its bite. Great session beer IMO. Refreshing and tasty, not at all heavy.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,TheBungyo,3.47,"Woooo, this poured like liquid autumn sunshine. Minimal head, but it was still a beauty to behold. I think I could smell this for ages, but I'd need to consult a chiropractor from bending my head so much. Unfortunately, the taste for me left a little to be desired. It's very bitter and hoppy, which is good, but there's a strange aftertaste that reminds me of corn chips. A shame because I love looking at it and smelling it. The smell really makes me feel like I'm in for a treat. One is enough for me, with that weird aftertaste I couldn't stomach another. I will, however, revisit this sometime in the future just to make sure.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,SupaCelt,4.3,"Copper orange pour with a huge initial white head that required some biding of my time before completing the transfer. Clear with no haze and a good cropping of bubbles traversing through to the surface. Full surface area white head remains perched atop the drank. Random mountain peaks of lace akin to dancing flames lick the edges of the glass.  The smell, a very earthy and freshly harvested mix of citus and pines. Grapefruit, pine sap, and grass lead the charge. Floral and mouthwatering inspiring anticipatory drool. Nary a foreshadowing of alcohol content. In my opinion there is nothing better than the smell of a good IPA. Real and tangible unambiguous scents persist in their full glory. Nothing to decipher here. Upfront and delicious smelling.  The taste is yet another thing of beauty. Perfect amounts of dryness and acidic fruit qualities interplay to produce a flavor that is so balanced and heavenly. Just the right amount of sweetness. There is no presence here that even comes close to being offensive. This flavor is simply unapproachable by the attempts of less fortunate brews and far surpasses the abilities of even the most worthy of opponents. Even the belches are edible and delightful. I could drink myself into a coma and be lain at the doorstep of death on this stuff; only to wake up and pour out another. This one belongs right next to another favorite of mine and shall henceforth be revered as a truly great piece of work. This makes me wonder if the 120 minute will be far more than just a journey into alcoholic debauchery. Gotta try it. Nice job Dogfish Head. This is one bad ass mofo.

10099,2093,pootz,4.4,An instant classic. bottled: a hazed orange gold ale with a miraculous frothy cap that stays...great lacing... the nose fills with grapefruit and pine over a sweet cooky dough aroma. Marvelous mouth feel...oily with the malts so dense they are syrupy/viscous...all the time balanced by the marvelous citrus-pine hops which turn only slightly bitter in the long finish...a masterful effort...an ale full of malt body and taste in balance with luscious citrus hopping.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,FirstMan,4.4,"Dear God. Hops.  This is one of the finest - if not THE finest - American brewed IPA I think I've ever had - and I've had the 120 minute IPA from Dogfish Head.  Yeah yeah, it's got a crystal-clear light golden amber color, yeah, yeah light head with lacy strands along the side. Let's get to the smell....  Hops! Hops! Oh the humanity! I could almost sit with my nose in this glass all day ... almost.  The first sip is bursting with floral hop flavor. None of the overbitter aftertaste that many IPAs suffer from. This one mellows into a wonderful bright and warm sweetness. The mouthfeel is a little deceiving becaus it's lightly syrupy and smooth, but the beer doesn't have an overly sweet character.  All around a great IPA. Just fantastic.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,warriorsoul,3.92,"On tap at Red Bones in Somerville, MA. I have had this brew in its 4 pack before and thought it was a hop bomb...amazing how things have changed in just over a year. Pours a golden orange color, surprisingly clear...I was expecting a very cloudy look for the amount of hops. Aroma is very pleasant...citrus (oranges mainly) hops dominate the nose w/ just a faint touch of alcohol. The taste is very sweet, almost too much at first. The pallet adjusts quickly and due to the fact that this beer is quite thin, it is not overbearing. I really enjoy its flavor, but again...I am quite surprised at how mellow this offering has become. Drinkability is decent...although there are other doubles I would prefer, as this one has almost no bitterness and the carbonation is too low. Alcohol is very well hidden...Dogfish does a great job of masking their alcohol. Overall, a good brew...looks like I will need the 120 to be truly impressed.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,nriech,4.64,Have only ever had this on tap locally here. Great aroma! The hoppiness is an acquired taste but well worth learning to savor the flavor here. Doesnt particuarly taste like a high alcohol beer. Personally the aftertaste could be a little less sour so I enjoy this beer with some strong flavored foods.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,palma,4.08,"Pours a nice amber golden color, creating a small to medium size head that fades quickly. Minimal lacing. Rings sticking to the sides of the glass.  Aroma is citrus, hoppy, but also a little odd. I always smell a kind of saltiness with all dogfish head IPA's. Dont know what thats about but it seems to be a signature dogfish IPA aroma.  Taste is dominated by hops upfront. Middle comes a blast of flavor kind of like sweet and sour. Big piney hops quickly followed by a flavorful caramel, crystal malt flavor. This all happens before the swallow. Its pretty surprising actually; just amazing how much is going on here. Then a different, more of a mellow, but very sweet malty aftertaste.  Smooth mouthfeel with a good amount of stickiness. Have to expect this due to all the hops.  This is a DIPA with great complexity, which is something hard to achieve in a beer with such a strong hop character.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,bensiff,4.32,"Pouring a deep murky golden color with a nice effervescence this beer lives up to its reputation.  The hop is there in force dominating smell and taste as any double IPA should. However, where so many of the style have tried and failed, Dogfish has taken this high gravity beer into the realm of beautiful balance between malt and hop without losing hop focus.  If you are a hophead I would stay with the Ruination, but for the aspiring hophead this is an outstanding way to get your taste buds wet. Either way, you cant go wrong with this liquid investment.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

A sense of malt shows up early and its pushed out the door. Hops rush in. Theres a good dose of grapefruit-like bitterness along with pine; an insertion of alcohol elbows in  Mouthfeel  initially big oil and solid creamy feel then theres a pleasant and light prickly crisp shot followed by a slight oily and a bit dry sensation; this is a wild ride; the next ticket is sought  Drinkability  the tinge of alcohol and army of hops causes me to back off a bit, but its so tremendously drinkable; packs a punch late  Here is a truly amazing product.

10099,2093,Shaw,4.38,"After reading so many raves about this beer here, I was really excited when I saw it in stock at my local Whole Foods.  It looks really good. Nice and deep gold color with a lovely head. The smell is hoppy with malt and alcohol notes. Not quite as hoppy as I'd like, though. The bottle notes that the beer is dry-hopped, which makes everything better.  The taste is very good. It's nice and bitter with lots of warmth from the high ABV. I love hoppy, bitter beers and this is a great example.  The body is slick, most likely thanks to the alcohol.  This is a more approachable American Double IPA than my favorite, Rogue's I2PA. And I hate to bring cost into this, but 90 Minute is a lot more affordable than Rogue's I2PA.  This is a very good beer and well worth seeking out.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,longarm,4.73,"Pouring amber and crystal clear, I'm surprised that this beer has the head retention that I'm seeing. It's 9% abv, but the lacing is still exceptional.  Aroma is subtle having elements of pineapple (weird), but not a lot of malt or aromatic sweetness.  The balance of flavors is stunning. It's hard for me to not be biased, since this is a favorite style of mine. That being said, this beer is a mastered balance of malt, caramel, and several types of hops interweaving to keep the beer interestingly sweet, yet bitter enough for repeated sips. A final hit of piney-pineapple hops disappears as quickly as it appears, cleansing the palate and leaving me begging for more.  Perfect.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,BeerFink,4.52,"Pours a clear golden color with about a finger of head composed of tightly night bubbles. The aroma is a wonderful floral hops bouqet, with some spice to it. There are hints of pine in the nose as well. The taste is damn bold. Starts off smooth (the malt only makes its presence known for a short while) then quickly is overtaken by hop boldness. The hops come in with some citrous then turn sharp and piney. No malts are detected after the initial smoothness. Some fruity flavors crop up to add to the complexity. The mouthfeel is big and sharp. The hops really throw your taste buds for a loop. The hop oil stays with you in a bitter citrous aftertaste. The alcohol presence is somewhat pronounced in the finish, warming your mouth and other parts of your digestive system. Although the alcohol is definitely there in the taste, it is not overwhelming and does not detract from the drinkability at all. Brews like this are turning me into a hop-head.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Its aroma is some spicy floral piney hops at first. It kind of devolves into a peppery leather smell though that isn't very appealing.  The flavor is sweet melon and some pepper up front. I don't get much hop flavor, but it does have a good lingering bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, but very smooth.  Overall, I found this to be underwhelming. It's a pretty average IPA and didn't live up to the high expectations (or price).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,bceaglejoe,3.88,"Presentation: Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. It poured a nice copper color with about a two-finger thick head. Retention was excellent, as the head stayed with the beer the whole time I drank it. The smell was a very pungent aroma of hops with a slightly alcohol-y scent to it.  Tasting: If this beer were slightly more balanced, it would be a 4.5. Though this was tasty, I felt that the hops overwhelmed the palate. It had a slightly fruity aftertaste to it, but not much. The higher alcohol content of this beer also made it ""burn"" a little bit more on the tongue. This makes it a less-drinkable beer (unless you want to get drunk really fast).  I definitely recommend this beer if you like the style. Those who aren't as big into hop flavoring won't like it as much.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Sycodrummer,3.22,"Recently had a pint on tap at the Sunset Cantina in Boston, Mass. A deep dark golden color that had about a half-finger head when it got to me and left very little lacing as I drank it.  Smell was hoppy and floral. Definite smell of alcohol up front. Inticing to be sure.  Taste left something to be dessired. Very prominate alcohol and hops galore. I like high alcohol beers but it seemed to get in the way with this beer. It was so much so that it took a good deal of focus from the other flavors and hop bitterness that was trying hard to get through but was masked by the alcohol. Compared to another Double IPA: Victory Hop Wallop, this simply wasn't all there and had serious balance issues.  Moderate/Heavy on the palate. Bit of a cough syrup consitancy.  Again, the alcohol took away from the drinkability as well as the fact it was poorly balanced. I'll stick to victory double IPA before revisiting this.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,IrishMike,4.13,"Bottled 2004 and purchased from my local liquor store at $8.99 for a four pack.  Appearance- Pours a light copper with plenty of carbonation fizzing up from the bottom of the glass. Nice 1 inch head that holds its own very well; excellent lacing. Decent head retention, usually subsiding into large pools on the top after quite a bit of waiting.  smell- Citrusy and grassy, but still surprisingly mild considering the style at hand here. A bit of pine, and almost a sharp cheddar quality to it.  Taste- Slick and powerful, with that cheddar and pine quality pushing itself through a suprisingly malty character that seems out of place, but certainly not unwanted, in a double IPA. Has a mellow sweetness to it, nicely balancing out the hops that still make up the majority of the taste in this brew. These two qualities come together to give it the typical flavor of hops but without the bitterness that is usually associated with them. Alcohol is well hidden here; detectable, but not easily picked up either. Closes the show with a grassy and mildly smoky finish. No abusive hops, just nice and clean.  Mouthfeel- it's been said before, and it's certainly a fact; this beer has an oily consistancy about it in the mouth. No bitter aftertaste, just a nice hop linger that stays and stays....  Drinkability- I've been known to down quite a few of these at any given time, thanks to it's well balanced nature and clean finish. The only thing that may detract from this is the fact that is it fairly sweet on the palate.  ProfessorMalt summed it up best with the statement that this is not a ""one-dimensional"" brew as is the case with a lot of double IPA's. Plenty of malt and a hint of sweetness balances this out, making it more than just a merely over-hopped beer (which unfortunetly seems to crop up a lot in this style), with quite a bit of complexity as well. Is it as great as the fuss makes it out to be? I myself am not one to listen to hype, as it tends to set people up for disapointment. Plus, it's not your typical beer of the style, so hop lovers may be a bit put-off by the experience here. I myself always have and will continue to love this beer to this very day, and i back it up with my fullest recommendation. Excellent.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

It poured a nice amber brown color, just a shade or two lighter than the bottle itself. Next came the bountiful, frothy head which was a very light tan.  The smell is strong of floral hops with maybe a slight citrus character. The taste is great. Honestly, the taste is so good it wouldnt matter to me what this beer looked or smelled like... it tastes truly magnificent. Citrusy and loaded with hops. The mouthfeel is also quite impressive, somewhat thick and almost heavy-bodied, but very smooth for being a 9.0% beer. Very well-rounded and well-balanced for a beer of it's style.

The taste is as bright as the appearance with a big spiced kick in the middle ending with a familiar alcohol kick at the end.  This is a good IPA, it really is, but to be quite honest it seems a little overdone, too much going on here. Every time I drink one of these hoppy IPA's I always end up annoyed, no matter how hard I try I can't like these hopmonsters. There is flavor layering and then there is trying too hard, this one is leaning toward the latter. Don't get me wrong this is an interesting brew, and nothing seems particularly bad about it, but in the end all I wanted was one.

Lots of hop bitterness in the finish; I was still puckering a minute after my last drink! The mouthfeel is a little on the syrupy side of medium, but it feels nice on the way down before giving way to the piney hops.

Full-bodied and perfectly bitter with floral hops, citrus and a nice malt backbone. I can't think of a beer easier to drink at this ABV level. The finish is soothing and nicely bitter and floral.

10099,2093,FormatKid,4.65,"This beer pours out a perfectly translucent body that is a ruddy copper in color. The head is slightly off-white, sticky and oily. Visible carbonation is sparse and fine. The nose is great, rich and sweet with pale malt, I believe the continual hopping process adds a ""completeness"" to the hops in the aroma. General bitter aromas, sweet apricot, citrus and rind, pine aromas....they're all here. When I drink the malts are sticky and sweet up front, dense bitterness quickly greets my palate as well. The apricot/tangerine flavors of the hops combined with the sweetness of the malt creates an almost candy-like experience. Again, I think the continual hopping process creates a nice complexity and completeness to the hop flavors as well as the aromas I noted earlier. I'm suprised more people have not experimented with the continual hopping process. Mouthfeel is perfect; gliding smoothly down, with enough gumption to make a solid impression. The finish is mildly dry with a teeny-tiny spicy peep of alcohol. A great balanced DIPA that hits you with a nice solid representation of all it's composing elements.

Finishes thick, rather smooth, and a bit medicinal with a deep resiny oak.  Assuming that the DFH quality control is ok now and this is what the beer will continue to taste like, I will have this now and again because it is exciting.

10099,2093,TinusTime,4.62,"Pours a deeper shade of amber with a fairly minimal head, but since i didnt watch the bartender pour the beer who knows if it was the beers fault or the bartenders. Nose is of Pine needles and sap, with a touch of floral notes. Taste is a pretty big hop blast. The Malt provides just enough backbone to keep the beer balanced. Tastes starts and finishs with lovely hoppy goodness. Mouthfeel is good with just enough carbonation to keep the beer from feeling heavy on the tongue. Drinkability is very high. Despite the ABV I would love to drink this all night.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,longpondbeerman,4.08,"This 90 pours a cloudy orange marmelade color with a pillowy white head. The hops and citrus rise immediately to the nose, but there seems to be a bit of chocolate under it all--unusual for an IPA, I must say. The taste was sharp and piney, and as expected for a double, the alcohol very much in evidence (this accounts for the sweetness). The mouthfeel is medium. The more I drink of this, the better I like it. Clean and fresh. It warms the soul on a cold winter night.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,santoslhalper,3.55,"Appearence: Pours a decently clear copper color with a nice white head. Leaves little spots of lacing. Nice slow moving carbonation as well.  Smell: The aroma is piney and citrusy, with a nice bready malt back. Mostly hops tho. Smells less hoppy than the 60 minute.  Taste and Mouthfeel: A suprisingly sweet malty presence hits at first. Almost caramel tasting. Hops then come around in the end, a little less than I thought they'd be. Decently balanced, but not enough. The mouthfeel is thick and chewy, a little too chewy for an IPA.  Drinkability and Overall: A good IPA, but it seems a little overated. A nice taste and all, but not near as good as some of the other DIPA's I've head. Dogfish Head definitly has a way of taking things to the extreme. Although this beer is no exception, it's not as well rounded and unique as some of their other offerings.  Thanks to GClarkage for the sample. Cheers, buddy.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,DrJay,4.32,"Appearance: Deep orange colour and slightly hazy. It was topped by a thick off-white head that had excellent retention and left generous foam stuck to the side of the glass.  Smell: Some toasted and biscuit malt were evident, along with a bit of alcohol. Hops were dominant, mostly pine and citrus (similar to oranges) characters.  Taste: To start, there's a solid malt base with plenty of sweetness that provides balance for other flavours that show up along the way. Hop flavour is piney or resinous to start. At the mid-point, alcohol flavour and fruitiness appear. Hops become more dominant at the finish, mostly the cascade/citrus variety. The finish is actually quite mellow for the complexity of flavour with some alcohol warming and no astringency or overpowering bitterness. In fact, bitterness is well controlled and balanced throughout.  Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation with a medium/full body. Good smoothness of texture.  Drinkability: The high alcohol content and fullness of body make this unlikely for a session, but the balance and finish keep it quite drinkable.  Other notes: As it warms in the glass, the aroma changes substantially. The hop character dimishes somewhat and a vinous, alcohol aroma combined with ripe fruit appears.  12 oz. brown bottle with the bottling date clearly printed on the label.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,GClarkage,4.55,"12/07/04- Received from a fellow BA buddy Spinlock from his trip to Boston.  Presentation- 12 oz bottle with a bottling date of October 2004. Served in my Duvel chalice.  Appearance- Poured with a nice inch head and had very nice lacing. I nice dark golden, light amber coloring.  Smell- At first there was not much smell. I had to cover up the glass with both hands and sneak my nose in to catch a scent. When I did I smelled nice candied sweetness. Maybe a tad bit of alcohol also.  Taste- Much sweeter than I expected. I've only had a few double IPA's and none of them were very sweet. So, this was a new taste experience for me. A nice amount of hops that was toned down due to the mellow sweetness of the beer. A nice warming sensation comes over me.  Mouthfeel- A decent amount of thinkness and very little carbonation. Goes down super smooth.  Drinkability- After it's all said and done you can feel the alcohol presence, but over all is a very drinkable beer. Thanks so much for the 4-pack Pete!

Very smooth silky mouthfeel, I could drink this all night... and I probably will.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Opethsprite,3.11,"My roommate and I split a 4-pack of this Dogfish IPA in celebration of one last bit of sanity before finals, and at $12.99 per 4-pack, I'd say that splitting it with someone else is a rather good idea!  It poured a honey amber color, highlighted with gold. A thin but nice-looking pale peach head was present, but only for a few minutes.  The smell is mostly a very sweet peach-apricot scent with just the slightest bit of caramel. There is a nice earthy smell in there somewhere, and hops are present, but not overpoweringly so.  It tastes of grains and a nice jolt of citrus, soon to be followed by a strong taste of alcohol (which, at 9.00% is no surprise). Hops are far more noticeable in taste than in smell.  The mouthfeel is good, as the carbonation plays lightly at the tongue. Almost a little too much carbonation for me, but its probably fine for most.  This 90-minute IPA is definitely drinkable, but one must be wary of the alcohol content. After one bottle, I can feel it a little!  All in all, this is a great beer. Probably not a staple beer in my place, but I'd welcome this beer as a great deviation from the norm.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,shirfan,4.15,"Honey golden with a long lasting, lacy off-white head.  Aroma is an enticing mixture of pine sap, pine needles, pine sawdust and warm earthy malt. Almost a smoky note.  Taste actually is carried by a biscuity malt flavor before hops bounce all around the palate without being strongly bitter. Pine predominates, with nuttiness, a hint of whiskey without the burn, and then yet more piney hops.  Balanced so well, this could pass for a mild ale if it wasn't for the warming that appears near the finish.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,alexAK,4.45,"Poured an almost golden orange with perhaps a hint of honey. Head retention was average, yet very foamy.  Aroma was very strong but not overwhelming, hinting at the complexity of the hops.  But it was the taste that blew me away, Very full w/ nary a hint of bitterness. A touch of sweetness...just enough to keep all the elemtents in balance. Handed a sample to a wine-drinking friend and he was very impressed.  While not being overly exceptional, the mouthfeel detracted nothing from the experience and was overall very solid. And if you asked me, I'd never guess that this beer was 9 % by volume, so it's fair to say that it's very drinkable.  I only wish this beer was more available in the town where I go to school.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,BuckeyeNation,4.2,"Brightly polished tangerine-amber with honey colored accents, topped by a thick, creamy head of rich ivory that is tacky enough to stick around, seemingly indefinitely, and to leave an impressive lace legacy when it eventually departs.  Even though the brewery calls it an IPA, there's little doubt that 90 Minute is a DIPA and a good one. The nose is full of bright, brassy citric hops with a sweet caramel maltiness swirled into the mix. Specific fruits include orange, grapefruit and apricot.  This is definitely powerful stuff. Some breweries create DIPAs with a relative emphasis on malt so that there's as much caramel flavor as hoppiness. Others place a relative emphasis on hops in order to produce a tongue-shredding, bitter, explosive hop monster. This beer looks like the latter, but tastes like the former. Trouble is, I prefer the latter.  There's still a lot to like here. The flavor profile is an amalgam of melted caramel, fermented pine sap, concentrated essence of oily citrus peel and alcohol. The alcohol masking--like a few other DFH beers that I've had--is more like those small black 'eye masks' than a full-faced Godzilla mask. That is, it's not that hard to appreciate what's underneath.  Maybe this is an old bottle (although I don't believe that it is) and the hops have softened too much. Running it through Randall the Enamel Animal should fix it right up, but I don't have one handy at the moment. Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA is still good-very good beer, but it doesn't quite crack my upper tier.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Popsinc,4.52,"Appearnce: a very appealing pour...clear golden-orange with a foamy, medium off-white head. as clear as apple juice.  Smell: hoppy and sweet. plenty over-ripened fruits...apricot, peach and bitter orange peel. oozing of hop.  Taste: sweet off the top with a cotton candy like fluffiness. orange peel and again, ripe aprcots. the sweetness maintains its staying power while giving way to some serious hop bitterness. the combine nicely and offer up a well balanced and big palate. both the fruity sweetness and hop bitterness linger nice and long and the maltiness is present too although hidden beneath it all.  Mouthfeel: some fuzziness to the mouthfeel. smoothes out mid sip and generally has a light to medium body character. very easy going down.  Drinkability: i feel like im not even getting the 9% abv here. The easy drinking combo of fruitiness and hop galore simply pleases my palate to no end.

10099,2093,mgdeth,3.87,"Appearance - Bottle has freshness marking - this beer is only a month or two old. Thick creamy head forms (and remains) on the pour. Color is light amber - great for an IPA of any sort.  Smell - Mild hop and malt aroma present. The smell is difficult to characterize. I was expecting something that would knock me over, but this beer did not do that. The bottle says that the beer is dry hopped, but the hop nose is largely missing. Maybe there is something wrong with my nose. Please consider how other reviewers have picked up on the aromas in this beer.  Taste - This one is a hop bitterness explosion! However, balance with the malt is good, and there is also a hop aftertaste that lingers for a long time. Alcoholic warmth sort of sneaks into the aftertaste as well. There is also characteristic ale fruitiness present here.  Mouthfeel - This beer has sort of a thick, almost syrupy feel to it. This seems appropriate for the style. The thickness also makes the beer more of a challenge to drink and enjoy. Novice craft brew drinkers should try the 60 Minute IPA first.  Drinkability - Stylistically, this beer is probably right on the mark. The thick mouthfeel makes the beer a bit difficult to drink at first. I got used to it through the course of the beer. Now that I know what to expect, I would like another. Experienced ""big"" beer drinkers should love this one.  Comments - I consider myself a hophead, and I really like this beer. Possible downside: if you are a relative lightweight like me, you cannot finish too many of these in one evening. Watch out! The 9% alcohol sneaks up on you quickly.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

It carries the weight of the style better than most especially in a wide glass (and the hops are the winner here). Great hops nose and actually clings to the glass way lighter than it actually is. Smells like some belgians but has the great american hops kick. The carbonation is just right for me but a may be a bit much for the style if you want to be picky. Bottom line? solid beer with a big nose, big alcohol and sneaky flavor for drinkability. An excellent IPA for sure.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The citrus hits half way through, and just a hint of malt, and a slight burst of alcohol come on the finish. Wow, more hops as I sit and think about the flavor profile.

The smell is unusually sweet, which is the first thing you notice on your taste, along with an odd sweet-citrusy flavor. Thought that this brew was about the hops, not the citrus.  Not that I'm complaining, the hops are definately there too, and the sweetness adds an unexpected complexity. This brew's almost refreshing, in its way. Nothing like the heavy hop slap I've come to expect from IPA's. Much more drinkable than I thought it would be. Good beer.

10099,2093,CAMRAhardliner,4.82,"I tried this great beer at Smokeless Joe's. Ive been waiting so long to sample it and it finally came to Toronto.... awesome.  It pours a brassy orange color with a moderate bristly head that leaves a great web of lace. The aroma is a compendium of hops. Theres citrusy, earthy, woody, piney and floral hop notes in the nose. A competent malt backbone is also very evident. The taste begins with a smack of hoppy bitterness which quickly turns resiny and herbal and then citrusy in the middle. Malt flavors also become prominent in the middle. In the finish the whole mass of hops becomes incredibly citrusy - like grapefruit rinds and mix with the bready malt flavors very well. The aftertaste is very bitter and complex, with all the different hop flavors lingering. The mouthfeel is resiny from hops and very thick. The alcohol content is completely hidden behind the hop assault. This is one hell of a good beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,rocketmotor,2.89,"Had to try the legend, here are my thoughts...  Nice color, a hazy orange color. Poured a smallish head that lasted till the beer was finished, with good lacing.  Smell is of strong hops, but not exciting at all. I can't pin down the scent, but it is rather rough, with the alcohol too coming on too strong.  The taste is another let down for me. Yes, it is very hoppy, with a good malt background, but it's just not exciting enough for me. More like an overhopped beer. The mouthfeel is rather heavy. The beer has a good finish, and does not leave too strong of a hop flavor remaining. This beer is easy to drink for being so strong in flavor and alcohol.  Overall, I am let down by the 90 Minute IPA. Guess I don't care for the hops that are used. Wonder what kind they are???",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,mattcrill,4.6,"Appearance: deep, crystal clear and copper in color with an ivory head. Looks pretty tough in a glass. As my nose approaches, I'm tingling with excitement.  Smell: Does not disappoint. I hate to say ""hops"" but that's what it is. Intense pine smell bordering on citrus freshness. There is a hint of malt sweetness to it but only after it warms.  Taste: Orange juice is the first thing to come to mind. Lip puckering goodness. There are hints of pine, orange, and believe it or not, a nice underlying sweetness that appears as it warms. It is what it is though...very much a hop lover's wet dream.  Mouthfeel: Oily, slick, and medium bodied. I sense multiple layers. One sip brings out pine, the other citrus, and finally some malt sweetness. This beer is a mosh pit in my mouth.  Drinkability: Suffers some just because it's a bad ass beer. It's definitely hops to the maximum.  Notes: It's these kinds of beers that could turn me into a ""hop-head"". Once you have this kind of beer, all other attempts at IPA's, double IPA's, whatever you want to call them, just seem silly.

The aromas are of herbal hops, bready malts, hemp, a bit of the ole' skunk (weed not the animal;-) and more. The taste is fruity and hoppy up front with a lovely ""herbal"" taste that leads into a bone-dry finish of alcohol, hops, and a bit of french bread.

This was a clear amber brew with a very big head, dense and foamy. It lasted quite a while.  The aroma was of hops. Complex, several kinds, layered and strong.  The taste was of intense hop bitterness, with not a lot of malt, and a long bitter slow finish.  What can I say? Better on tap than in the bottle. The closest thing to a perfect beer that I have had yet. It was beyond true description. I have GOT to find a bar that has this on tap, and make it my home.

Beer arrived in an english pint glass with a head so dense, I could have sculpted it with a putty knife. Excellent head retention with heavy lacing. Beautiful deep amber with a hint of orange.  Smell was crisp clean hops with citrus predomitating, oranges and grapefruit. Also a hint of clove and honey.  Taste was simply outstanding. No other way to describe it. A burst of refreshing clean hops right from the get go, with a glorious middle of mild fruit. Extra dry clean finish. It's very hard to tell from the taste that this is a 9% abv beer.  Mouthfeel was excellent. Many beers this hoppy leave a long aftertaste that can seem to stay with you for days. Not this beer. Just the right amount of carbonation allows it to slip down easy with.

Pours a rustic orange copper that is slightly hazy. The head is sticky, creamy-soft, and very light tan. Very good lacing. Smells mostly of very citric hops, some piney resin, and alcohol. I can also pick up a solid base of sugary sweet malt. Taste starts off with an acidic hop greeting, followed by sugary mini-donuts, which don't last long. A bitingly acidic and juicy hop wave crashes in and takes over. Notes of fruit try to crack through and do, a little bit. The bitterness is big and citrusy overall. Finish stays resiny, and bitter and dry for quite a while, with some lingering sugary/fruity malt. Mouthfeel is big and coat-your-mouth sticky.

Poured a golden orange color, with a big, off-white head and lots of lace.  Smell is of...hops (duh) - piney ones, citrusy ones, floral ones. Smells glorious.  Taste is even better than the smell. While there is a malt backbone to the proceedings, it gets held to the ground and relieved of it's lunch money by the hoppiness, after which it slinks into the background. The hops aren't nearly as intense and overbearing as I had expected, and are much more diverse. Piney, citrusy and floral hoppiness are all encountered, and all of these hoppy aspects are brilliantly balanced. While there is a dryness at the finish, it isn't a bash you over the head, massively bitter, Death Valley kind of dryness, but far more subtle instead. This is the best tasting IPA I've ever had.  Nothing to complain about in the mouthfeel department. This is a medium bodied ale. Carbonation is where it should be.  Drinkability is great, except for the abv, which would put many on their ass in no time.

After the pour you get a one finger, off-white/beige head that lingers for a long while, in fact I finished the beer before the head could disipate.  The brew is a hazy, golden brown color with a burnt orange hue.  The nose is like snorting a line of powdered hops. There's some estery textures and honey there too, but mainly hops.  What a flavorful beer. Smokey hops, pine, raisins, caramel and more hops. The alcohol isn't particularly well hidden but it doesn't deter from the flavor at all.  The mouthful is lighty carbonated, but there is also another tingling sensation from the alcohol and the hops. Terrific consistency.  The aftertaste is a somewhat bitter, hoppy burn. I detect caramel, dried fruits and hickory smoke.  As far as drinkability goes this is definitely not a beer to do keg stands with but I'm certainly not having any problems putting them back  The 90 minute is an ideal American ale.

Aroma is mostly floral hops with light pine hints in background, with a light malt presence detected. Not as intense as one would expect from a Double IPA. Taste is lots of hops not overly bitter but lots of hop flavor followed by sweet malt body leaves a little bitter lingering aftertaste but again little weak for a Double IPA. Mouthfeel is not bad maybe a little light for a 9% brew but not bad. Drinakability is good these go down smooth and easy and at 9% could lead to trouble, but taste wise is more like a good IPA.

I have been wanting to try this one for a while and now I am disappointed it is not a bad beer but it is not the kick ass beer like I was expecting.

Drinkability is exceptional for this 9% beer. The beer is easy to drink. The alcohol is slightly noticeable, but not what I would expect. I could definately finish the four pack at once. It is kind of expensive though.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,ncbrewerbun,4.62,"Ahhhh...hops; but not without the malt! This beer poured a clear golden ammber color with orange hints. It had a wonderfully thick long-lasting head with lace that just stuck around. The great balance of hops and malt begins in the nose, where you pick up a near perfect marriage of the two. The malty bitterness continues in the flavor and right on through to the aftertaste. This is a beer that will stay with you for awhile after it disappears from your glass.  After tasting this once again, I just have to up my ""taste rating"" to a 5. This is one beer that just seems worth it.  Pour it, smell it, sip it, let it linger and enjoy it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,NearerMyBeerToMe,3.78,"A head just lighter than the color of khaki sits on top of a deep bronze liquid--the color of a dirty penny--with topaz highlights. Gloopy, substantial head leaves webby lacework that sticks somewhat nicely. A few streamers idle through this liquid of above-average viscosity. Big hop aroma is dusty and pollen-like, but can't completely hide a firm, sweet, almost porridge-like malt body. The hop smell here is a double-edged sword for me--I like the suggestions of straw bales and cedar chips; I don't care to be reminded of the smell of ""green dragon"" (a vile stoner concoction involving marijuana soaked in hot vodka). Flavor begins with a bran muffin and marmalade-like sweetness at the tip of the tongue. Calling the hop flavor ""bitter"" is not quite accurate. It's more like a brute spiciness that's nearly peppery in character. Big oregano and possibly mint flavors are also involved in a gripping aftertaste. Varnish-like, yet smooth, mouthfeel is downright numbing without being astringent. Like a bulldozer with a leopard interior. This is a big beer whose characteristics didn't quite resolve for me until I was nearly done with the sample (12 oz.), at which point my tastebuds were exhausted anyway. The first time I had this beer, I liked it a lot better than I liked this sample, and I have reason to believe that this bottle may have been mishandled. Still, I think there are Double IPA's that handle the balance of massive flavor, alcohol, and overall refreshment better than this one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,hobbes2112,4.2,"12 oz. bottle  Huge off-white head with lots of lace, golden color with an amber core. Somewhat hazy, but just a little.  Floral and pine notes from the hops that you would expect are joined by malt and a few other elements that I didn't know how to describe (sweet).  Taste is great, very smooth layering of the hop bitterness and sweet hints of malt. The edges are crisp, but not rough and the finish is long pleasant.  I am quite happy with the way this beer is put together, the alcohol is noticeable, but not overpowering; carbonation is perfect and the body works well also.

As soon as I pull up my bar seat, my favorite bartender asks what I'll have and with out hesitation I reply: ""90 minute please"". ""Good choice"" he responds. A bottle with a more modern looking label and a pint glass arrive. I soon pour this golden/orange exilir into the pint and note the massive citrusy/hoppy aromas that are present. Reminds me a lot of Dreadnaught. First sips conjure more sweetness than I would have liked, but the hop bite is immense. Not as much balance as Dreadnaught and aftertaste is stuck with the syrupy sweetness of an ultra-hopped beer. The 9 percent alcohol never steps up to take center-stage, but you can certaintly feel it's effects. Overall, this is a very good double IPA, but I'll still stick to my FFF when it counts.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

My label is a light red brick color with a dark silhouette of what one has to assume is a Dogfish, with a paragraph explaining the beer under it. Aroma: Burst of citrus; orange, tangerine, grapefruit, with a real hit of hops. Almost perfume intensity. I dab a bit behind each ear. Appearance: Pale orange amber body with a good head of off white that laced as the initial pour collapsed. Head became clumpy and thin, but left a spray painted lace. Flavor: Wow, for all the hop intensity and abv., a very mellow and well blended taste. A great round taste, no harsh bitter edge but lots of hop flavor. Malt is expressed, but sweet doesnt come to mind as a descriptor. Lots of the fruit flavors forecast in the nose blossom here. The taste actually brings SNs Celebration Ale to mind. As the beer warmed, the alcohol started to peek through and the hops really edged into a slight burn, but an enjoyable burn. Mouthfeel: Heavy body triggered a quick chew, the consistency of a well blended milkshake, and about as creamy of a feel. Some serious oils took their time in soaking in my mouth, leaving a tingle and a pucker. About a third of the way down, the warmth starts to set in. Overall Impression: Dangerously drinkable. While I could make a session of these, I would be worthless very quickly. This is a special occasion type beer, and more of a winter beer in my book. With the hop level, these should age nicely until they are needed in the grip of winter. Strongly recommended.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

That 20-pound cylinder of CO2 is this pimp beer's no-tooth whore.  Draught gives 90 Minute power -- power that it doesn't need. But it also calms it down, as the whore bringing the night's earnings home to big poppa.  Creamy and smooth, draught 90 Minute is devoid of the sometimes harsh alcohol that I have tasted in some 12 ounce bottles and have heard is quite prevalent in the 750s. Though that alcohol highlights the bitter I2PA qualities of this beer in the bottled version, its absence underscores a much more appealing and elegant freshness on-tap.  Quite simply, this is a different beer on-tap. While the primary characteristics that make bottled 90 one of the finest beers ever produced -- sweet toffee, bright pine, and candied flowers -- it comes together seamlessly when pressure-forced through a small metal valve.

Pours from the bottle a nice opaque orange with a 1 inch head that proceeds to leave some beautiful lacing before I even take the first sip. The smell is a floral bouqet of hops. The mix of hops invades my nose...and some citrus hints come throuh too. I could smell this one for quite some time...definetly more fragrant than the 60 minute. The first sip is great...a wall of hops hits my tounge and it doesn't hold back. The biterness is just right and the brew is very well balanced. The alcohol is virtually nonexistant in the taste. This beer will make any hophead smile. The barley and hops are near perfect...this is definetly one of my new favorite IPA's. Mouthfeel on this brew is perfect...a full body without being to overwhelming....I couldn't ask for anything more. As far as drinkability..I'm going to have to rate this quite highly as well. It tastes great, goes down easily and truly satisfies my craving for a wonderfully hoppy brew. I think the only major downfall to this beer may be its price tag...a little hard on the wallet...but it's still damn well worth it. For any of the hopheads out there that haven't tried the 90 minute IPA yet...I recommend you seek it out and indulge in this craft brewing masterpiece.

A bit different from it's cousin the 60 minute IPA I was not disappointed at all to finally taste this beer for the first time. Served on tap this beer poured a dark caramel, almost pumpkin color. Not much head to speak of at all. The aromas are citrusy, fruity, hoppy. Almost champagne like. The first taste knocked me back a bit. Similar to the Eleven in flavor, just not quite as strong or in your face. Hoppy but well hidden by the sweet honey and apricot flavor. Almost nectar-like. The finish has a nice grapefruity bite to it and a floral aftertaste. I liked the 90 minute alot. In fact after tasting it, I ordered a pint to share with crabby.

The flavor of this IPA was huge. Very sweet and spicy up front, lots of grapefruit and pepper in there as well, sour fruits and dough in the middle, and a nice bitterness covers your tongue at the finish. The mouthfeel was just great; slightly oily, which gave it a very smooth and creamy feel. This stuff is dangerously drinkable as well.

They are piney, woodsy and somewhat citrusy. I have had this beer before, but it was 3 years ago this week, so I have come a long way since then. Here we go with the first taste. Beautiful. In my face earthy hops to start that melt into a sweet malt finish. The balance is fantastic...best IIPA I've had to date...best offering from Dogfish I've had to date.

I could smeel this beer before i even finished pouring the glass and no i was holding my nose half an inch from the rim. the appearance i thought has quite exceptional(that might by a little too high praise, but never the less): a light orange with a nice amount of head that held despite the high alcohol.  what surprised me most about this beer was the first sip. not what i was expecting. the hops do come first, not surprisingly, but are followed by a far more intense malt flavour than i was expecting. i suppose i didn't believe the label (""balanced by a ridiculous amount of english 2-row barley""). And then it finishes off with a salt and pepper(alcohol) ending. very interesting and not at all expected( 3rd use of the word in one paragraph, cheeky).

Cap settles wuickly into a scant solid slick coating that is well retained.  Balanced matured malts vs. hops nose that is coated well to really erupt, but after a few swirlls the grassy piney hops take effect.  First swigs: Bold balance for a 2IPA. Sticky ripping hops are fought back by the molasses malts. THis is a malestrom of a brew. Spiced tang bites back blended by back 'n forth hops fire and malt extinguisher. Awl-kee-hawl esters build while warming. Isopropryl notes on the tongue. Thick lingering heat aftertaste with spices. Exotic flavors.  If you're careful, these can go back all night long, despite the 9% ABV.  Last swigs: A bit of a basic pour countenance, that fights hard. Hops are hidden behind the malt muscle. 2IPA with backbone.

Finish is once again hoppy, extremely bitter with lots of piney flavor. This works nicely with the surprisingly creamy mouthfeel to add to the balanced ""feel"" of the beer.

A sappy resin, citrus and a minor malt in the background make up the rest of the scents.  A huge bitter hop bite is the first flavor. It has a nice juicy sweet citrus flavor mixed in to the middle. This makes the drinker want to drink it quick. The flavors all join well together except for the finish. This is the reason I cannot rank this IPA with superb numbers. It is a fine IPA but the finish is very unpleasant. It leaves a deep ash and poorly burnt toasted quality on the palate at the end. These not so tasty flavors linger much too long. It was quite a shame as I was really looking forward to this IPA. It is very hard to find in California on a regular basis.  It drinks very easy. Mouthfeel has a stickyness to it that is quite unusual. The feel of the IPA lingers after being swallowed. The high alcohol is well hidden and there is no burn or flavor from it, so it is a neutral after thought.

Seriously, though, I don't know whether this is the best -- or one of the best -- Imperial IPAs I've ever had or if it's simply an overzealous exploration of the use of hops en masse. Many of them are pleasurable beers, and judging them on their level of excellence compared to their own objectives, they're superb -- especially this one.  Oily, hair gel look to it. Nice lacing. Vibrant looking with a lively aroma. Hoppy to say the least -- some citric fruit, but this is primarily grass and sappy pine cones rolled in pine needles and dipped in Pine-sol. The hop flavor is displayed like a stuffed moose head for all the world to see. Coats the mouth with bitter, hoppy, potent oiliness but doesn't let you forget where this is coming from: Dried out malty flavor and carbonation combines to make this a fairly effervescent, refreshing beer despite it's high abv and insane hop content.

The hops were fresh and crisp and did a great job of covering up the alcohol taste. Without the Randall I think the alcohol might be slightly to noticeable to really enjoy this beer.

The alcohol provides a slight warming of the mouth.  Overall: This is a prefect example of an imperial/double IPA - one of the best I've had.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,edchicma,4.2,"Poured a nice dark gold with a very nice head that laced very nicely. Smell was distinctly floralwuth a hint of yeast bouquet..very nice. Taste was sharp with hops of a citrus nite, but malt was there too to relieve some of the harshness. Very nice lightly bitter aftertaste. This is a 9.0 abv brew, so allcohol obviously is there, but not to the point of distraction. Malt presence smoothed out the mouthfeel and made this a nice drinkable brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,chriscolby,4.12,"12 oz. bottle.  Amber, Slightly hazy. Somewhat light head. Very hoppy aroma, but even through the mountain of hops, some malt aroma pokes through. (My beer shows a fair amount of ""wet cardboard"" oxidation, but it's been in my refrigerator awhile.) The flavor (and mouthfeel) of this beer is very interesting. Although known as a big hoppy beer (and it is), there is a pile of malt backing up the hops. And, the malt doesn't quit until the hops are almost gone from the aftertaste. It's maltiness early, malt middle and malt late to complement the ""hop steamroller"" level (and persistence) of hops. This beer is almost like a Scottish ale -- with the sweet edge to the malt -- with a ton of hops added to every nook and cranny. Hmmm . . . big malt behind big hops -- these guys might be on to something. Very full-bodied with a mildly creamy mouthfeel.  In all, this is a very big (9% ABV), very malty and (above all) very hoppy IPA. As you might expect, this beer fills you up fast. Enjoy it when you are only going to have one or two or you'll end up bloated (and likely, hammered -- not that that's a bad thing every once in awhile).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,granger10,4.5,"Wow, I had heard so much about this beer and now am glad to realize that it really did live up to its reputation. Pours a cloudy golden pearlike color with a good sized foaming white head. Lots of bubbles racing to the top. Smell is very citrusy and I definitely feel an alcohol burn on my nose hairs. This beer has a depth of which I have not encountered too many times before. Very, very hoppy yet not too bitter. The malt base is superb. Lots of caramel malts and a somewhat wheaty base. Hops are mainly citrusy but there a variance in the citrus flavors. Alcohol fussels work with the beer and provide more depth and complexity. This is simply a world class brewed beer. Michigan needs to get Dogfish Head!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,PopeJonPaul,4.4,"Poured milky amber dirt-brown with a creamy head. Hints of oranges and peaches hiding behind a strong hop aroma. This is a beer of two well-balanced extremes: sweet, sugary fruity alcohol taste juxtaposed (I've been waiting to use that word) with a strong needling hoppy bite that will pop open all your taste buds. They don't cancel each other out, rather they twist your taste buds around so much your tongue tingles like an arm or leg that's just 'waking up' from being asleep for hours - but it goes down silky-smooth, and it's, er, even refreshing. Insane.  Very drinkable, more than 3 will make you slap-happy. Go for it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Strong citrusy hop rush to the nose, with a hint of the piney hops following.  Dang. This stuff beats you over the head and then takes your lunch money. Big piney hops, with a blast of the citrus. It almost cools the mouth, drying it out like cottonmouth. A hint of peach is in there.  Very smooth for the amount and variety of hops present.  After drinking this for a while, I was suprised to see my glass still half full. Make no mistake, this is a big beer, completly different from it's little brother, the equally impressive in it's own way 60 minute IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,BrewMan82,4.25,"Pours a cloudy golden color - small white head diminishes instantly. Aroma is intense hops - fruity and citric. The flavor is surprisingly well balanced between very strong hop spicyness and a strong pale malt. This makes for a very drinkable imperial, as no taste or feel overpowers another. Little lacing - mouthfeel is full, chewy and intensely flavorful. Did I mention this brew is intense?",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,MrNuggets,4.23,"Orange colour full of golden highlights. The small head is a shade away from white and doesn't last long. Subtle hops on the nose, seems to be alot going on in this beer.

Silky mouthfeel then I'm left with a lingering bitterness in the back of my mouth. Pretty sure I'll be trying this again!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Porkfist,4.52,"Beautiful beer, and a surprise. When I first pursed it,, beautiful light copper color with a nice head that lingered. Then I smelled it...I was worried for a minute. Did I just spend $10 on a four pack that was going to be just like the Harpoon IPA? The hops were present, but it reminded me of Harpoon, which I am not fond of. Then I tasted. WOW. Fantastic. Nice hoppines but perfect balance. Felt , as my non-beer drinking wife put it, ""creamy"" This will now be a regular in my household. Could drink these all day, but at 9%, I think it would knock me on my ass after a few.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,nvsblman,3,"Courtesy of PSUDREW... Poured a bronze color with about a finger's worth of head. There was surprisingly little hop aroma I thought, what was there had a citrusy note to it. The taste was piney, maybe spruce, with a lingering hop aftertaste. A modest malt background. Medium mouthfeel, just a little creamy.  I'd been looking forward to trying this one, but was surprised how average I thought it was. I thought the 60 Minute was a far superior beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Pours crystal clear orange amber with a foamy, rocky white head. I can't wait, I cant' wait.  Smells citrusy, pine, and some smokiness. Smells like hot pine needles.  Taste is big. Really big. No, I mean BIG. Piney and citrusy, with a curious and wonderful smokey quality. Ever bite into a pine cone? I haven't, but if I did, I would hope it would taste like this. Spruce overtones. Hops stick around.  Oily mouthfeel but a full-bodied beer here.

Noticeably sweet and hoppy aroma previews a nicely balanced blend of citrus, hops, and alcohol that is quite pleasing to my taste buds. More prevalent malts than other beers of the same style, bringing a nice (and rare) balance to a highly-hopped beer.

10099,2093,wailingwench,4.38,"On tap at Blue Tusk, Syracuse, NY  Eye Candy: The color and clarity should instantly clue you in about the ABV and % of hops in this fighting fish. Poured with a small head but plenty of lacing present. Gold in color with a swirling, translucent haze.  Skunk-aroma: Whoa, a mix of everything. Pine and floral followed by kick of hops really clerared out my nose. Pretty intense on the floral note of the hops, only a slight citrus was detected.  Tongueland: Thick and vivacious. Assaulted with sweetness up front and bitter bringing up the rear. Left the desired ""oily"" lingering aftertaste that pale ale lovers crave. Girlfriend finished almost a whole pint before it warmed to the point of no return and the alcohol took over. Warming on tongue due to high ABV. I prefer beers that have a taste progression over a temp range, and 90 min stood out in this category.  Chugability: If you want to make it untill 9 pm, no. Otherwise, enjoy your 3 hours (if you're lucky).  Bender Factor: Oh yeah.

Gorgeous peachy color, big, fresh, full head of bone-white foam. Aroma: BAM! Whoppity-snappityBAM!BOOM!BAM!, that's the full force of the pine up in there, the intense grapefruit, all the citric flavor that embarks on the senses and nevers flags for a second, grassy, herbal, potent, totally hoppy, sprucey, piney, pineappley, so much going on in this nose! But, to taste...Ah! A wonderful mess here, a big, mix of hops and citric fruity flavor, the punchy pine on the palate, yum, yum, yum. If you're not sufficiently infatuated with humulous lupus, sit this one out, by all means. A big, sticky, fruity, citric mouthfeel, and, yeah, there's grapefruit, but so much more. Like licking a forest floor, at times, this one, if I may be so bold. Yeah, but if it's hops you want, lean back and enjoy this onslaught, it's astonishingly tasty! Love it, love it, love it!

10099,2093,Quaffer,4.54,"I just recently sampled and reviewed the 90-Minute IPA for the first time from the bottle. I was extremely unimpressed and decided that I would never try this beer again. But, on a recent trip to NYC, the Blind Tiger had this brew on-tap and served via a Randall. I just couldn't pass up the oppurtunity to try out this new and unique serving device.  Smell: My God. The amount of raw, unadulterated hops that rose up out of the glass was unbelievable. It was huge and oily smelling, comprised mainly of pine and grapefruit. It was absolutely thick and heavenly.  Taste: I have never had a beer that had this much raw hop flavor to it without having hardly any bitterness. That's right. Almost no bitterness. But the hops flavor was huge. I could imagine that this is what it is like to pop a few hops cones in my mouth and start chewing. This flavor was complimented by a large malt presence that was strong enough to leave my lips sticky. It was almost too much, considering the lack of bitterness in this beer.  Nothing, and I mean nothing, gave me any hints that this beer was the same one that I tried from the bottle just a few weeks before. The only thing that kept it from getting a perfect taste score was the lack of bitterness to balance out the heavy malt sweetness.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,tar,4.22,"Pours from the bottle a hazy, orangish yellow, with a thin off-white head, which diminishes rather quickly leaving only a very thin layer of gray/white bubbles--although this thin layer of a head manages to produce some sticky lacing on the glass. Nice strong aroma of hops--flowers, spice, and some citrus scents--issue forth from the glass. Tastes as expected from the strong hoppy smell: nice hop flavors (flowers and citrus fruits) with a good bitter finish. Some malty sweetness is present as well, although fairly hidden behind the wall of hops. A very drinkable and tasty Imperial IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,BadBadger,3.85,"A descent looking amber, some what intermediate in depth of color. A nice off-white head which lasts the duration. A slightly hoppy smell, nothing overwhelming.

Taste: A big blast of hops, followed by apple and grapefruit tastes. It leaves hop bitterness in every corner of the mouth for a long time. Really great tasting hops. Considering the ABV, the alcohol is very well hidden, but it does become more evident near the bottom of the glass. A phenominal flavor overall. Mouthfeel: Rich and creamy, almost buttery texture.

Hops are a little piney a touch of citrus, and a little woody. Medium body brew with light carbonation. A sweet/fruit taste due to the higher alcohol content. The hops were not off set by the sweetness. This was a true Imperial IPA.  A crisp beer. A refreshing beer. One of my favorite.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,RocketWidget,4.5,"Just a side note - comes in a standard 12 oz bottle (in a four pack, oddly enough), not the corked bottle currently shown as the image for this beer.  Pours a deep gold with good, longlasting foamy white head. Smells of hops, hops and hops! The smell is intoxicating. And man, is this good stuff! A thick and heavy blend of hoppy, bitter flavors overwhelms the tastebuds, compensated by an almost creamy sweet malt profile. No detectable flaws to be found. A beer worthy of much respect, and an excellent all around show. I wish I had the money to drink this more often!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Lupe,4.03,"The hazy, golden-amber brew is topped by a nice creamy, off-white head. Head sticks around for the entire drinking experience and leaves some lace. Herbal and piney aroma, from the hops of course, and a hint of citrus. Some toasted malt sweetness lurks in the backround, hidden by the hops. Hops dominate (duh) giving herbal and floral flavors, along with grapefruit, orange and other citrus fruits. Malt backbone shows up to balance with a light toasted flavor in the backround. Bitterness is big time, but tantalizing, not overpowering. The alcohol does not hide, adding a little to the flavor profile. Full and rich in body. A little coarse on the tounge, but fairly smooth.

Some lacing down the glass. Don't know if the aroma mellowed as it aged, but it is a bit weaker than expected. Still, it has a strong hop aroma, with some lemony notes. Suprisingly sweeter taste with only a little bitterness. maybe even a little bready and lemony taste. This was really nice!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Mitchster,3.53,"Pours to a very clear copper, forming a moderate-sized spongy beige head with great retention and delicate lacing. No yeast in the bottle...appears filtered. Carbonation is mild to moderate, requiring a firm pour. Aroma is uniquely pungent with skunky marijuanna, sharply resinous piney hops, cedar, sweetly floral hops, pipe resin, sticky malts, acetone and mint. Mouthfeel is soft with a dense body and hoppy dry finish. Small amounts of diacetyl are present. Taste begins less bitter than expected...certainly pungent but somewhat balanced by a firm malt body. There is a strong fusel alcohol pang which makes me cringe halfway through, and the estery alcohol is a bit much. As it warms, these mellow and make it more enjoyable. The finish is nice, with a lingering sweetness and a pungent, grapefruit pith bitterness of moderately-strong intensity. Dank weed roots and aerated black soil crop up. Leaves a slimy coating upon the tongue.  I read the previous review stating that the hops are subdued and began laughing. The hops are completely over the top and balance is thrown to the wind. Reminds me of Stone Ruination. I don't know why anybody would want to drink more than one of these at a time. Bigger is not automatically better.

Cirtrus aromas, grapefruit and lime, linger about, some nuttiness to this as well, more of a grain smell though. Tastes is bold, but not overpowering. Hops come out strong, accompanied by the slight taste of alcohol. Citrus tang keeps the flavor nice and sweet, some candy-like sweetness here, and the bitterness stays with you the whole way, but nothing to shrivel your tounge and pucker you lips.

The smell was very spicy with a slight malty undertone that said nothing but average I.P.A. But the smell was the only thing average about this beer. The drink started with a very strong hop kick followed with no let up in the middle, and a very strong hop finish.  I know all these strong hops sound like too much but they were not at all. This beer displayed so much character, more than any I had ever experienced. The strong hops followed by the hot alcohol undertones just played into what I can only call the almost perfect I.P.A.

There's a light, white head that doesn't last terribly long, but lingers as traces of lace down the side of the glass.  I'm surprised at the clarity of this beer. It's crystal clear, with no haze I associate with very strongly hopped beers. I'd suspect fine-filtering, but it could be simply cold-aging in the bottle.  The initial aroma is a blast of hops. It immediately made me think of sticking my nose in a bag of hops. There's nothing subtle about it, and I love that smell. First taste is a satisfyingly, palate-destroyingly bitter assault, followed by a strong malt sweetness that wars with the bitterness, finally losing to it.  The malt character comes through a bit more strongly as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is slick without quite making it to syrupy. The potent amount of alcohol in this brew is very effectively masked by the hops. But then, everything is well masked by the hops.  I really love this beer. Good job Dogfish Head!

It is, of course, more intense than the 60 minute, which is the other DFH hop beers that I've tried. This one poured a deep gold with a substantial head and tremendous, long lasting lasting lacing all the way down the pint. The aroma is overwhelmingly one of hops to the point that it is all that I can smell. The taste is mahvelous, as Billy Crystal would say. A real hops treat, bitter as it should be but with a hint of sweetness at the end. This is a substantial beer with an hop oil feeling to it in the mouth. It goes down really smooth. The last taste is as good as the first. I found my mouth getting a little puckered so I'm not sure I would want to polish off the four pack in one evening of drinking.

When it comes to the smell of this beer only one word is needed, 'hops"", or if you prefer three ""lots of hops."" I was very surprised with the taste, after taking a sniff of the beer I expected to be completely overwhelmed by hops. There was plenty of hops to tickly the taste buds but this was nicely complimented by warming alcohol and roasted slightly smoky malt for balance, also a touch of sweetness sort of a raisin taste. Wonderful body and mouthfeel the carbonation awakens the mouth and entices you to drink more.  Really a very fine beer that if I had the self control I would like to age for a while and then sample.

It has a fluffy but tight white head and small, but persistent carbonation. Wonderful smell. Rich hop and sweet bready malt come across. Fruity alcohol is apparent in the nose. The taste is incredible. The beer is so smooth, complex with slick hop oils and sweet sticky fruit. Not as grapefruit-like as some other Imperial IPAs. One burp will let you know that the hops are in charge, but they don't offend when the beer is being drank. They're hidden in there, nice and happy, not raw but mixed up in the malt. Mmmm. Slick and slippery, this one goes down without asking. I keep thinking about brandy, without the aftertaste. Rich and delicious all over. The alcohol is there, and really contributes to the flavor, but in a very good way. A pitcher of 9% hit me pretty hard. Still, the beer is a triumph.

It is well balanced for the style. Not a session beer, but I could see this as a good apertif.  12 oz bottle - Many months after first tasting this beer in the 750 format, I have tried it in the 12 oz bottle. I pretty much have the same impression of it. At least the numbers seem to match. It pours a cloudy orange with a thin white head. I remember the large bottles head was much nicer. The aroma is still predominantly hops (citrus, mint, herbal) with some sweet maltiness. The taste has some orange notes, it is slight yeasty and then finishes with herbal, minty, earthy hops.

10099,2093,Fish113d,4.6,"To enjoy drinking I.P.A.s and to not have the Dogfish 90 minute is a crime! I had not experienced this ale up to this point due to not being the hugest IPA fan, but this ale changed my feelings on them COMPLETELY!  I poured the bottle at room temperature into a snifter, and noticed that it was copper in color or even orange. After pouring, the edge layer of head stuck around and klung to the glass nicely. Upon smelling, I got some very floral odors, w/ scents of pine and a tingle of alcohol on the nose. After tasting the first sip, my face lit up with a smile due to tasting the very hoppy tones, which dissipated nicely throughout the sip, but then came the sugar I tasted at the rear-end of the sip. This sugar really came through and got me interested in how they got it to taste like cotton candy or rock candy, with hints of green grapes in there! This sealed the deal for me with this one! It was medium bodied, with good flavor, mouthfeel, etc. I honestly wish I had a 2nd bottle to crack right now! I definitely recommend. If intersted in doing some trading, I would be happy to get my hands on this ale for anyone for some interesting stuff from other parts of our glorious country!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,JohnnyDuvel,4.47,"Different enough to stand out. The appearance is clearer and more amber than a lot of other IPA's. Real fruity and hoppy, for sure, but of a different type (apricot?). Gets better as it goes, and ultimately is quite satisfying. Not overly bitter, but quite an ""in your face"" beer. Dogfish head is 2 for 2 with me, and I can get in Florida (hey ho!).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,chaduvel,4.2,"Pours a thick cloudy imposing dark orange color. Sticky sappy head that leaves lacing all over the place. Smell is intense pine sap and biting hops. Very aromatic and inviting. Sweet hoppy flavors dominate, but there is enough malt in here to provide balance and sweetness. The mouthfeel is smooth as capilene. This is a pretty damn good beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Southernbrew,4.74,"Pours amber, nice full head.  Very strong hops aroma, surprise, surprise. Lots of pine and citrus here, definite hops blast coming.  Wow, very hoppy. Lots of citrus and pine flavors, almost oily feel, very full bodied. Alcohol is very warming and noticable but pleasant. Dry and bitter finish.  Delicious IIPA, one of my favorites, a delight for anyone who loves the piney, citrus hops.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,proc,4.79,"What an excellent IPA.  First off, I love IPA's. There is something about the hops, that when you become a seasoned beer drinker, they beckon to you.  This one pours out to an bright amber in the glass. The aroma is that of grapefruit, papaya, passion fruit and every tropical fruit know to man.  The taste is superb. The hops are wonderful and enriching, but aren't too strong (again, this coming from an IPA guy). The malt provides a superior balance that rounds out the hop bitterness making for a wonderful finish.  This is an excellent beer that hides its ABV well.  Imperial IPA?  Yum.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,AllThingsNinja,4.73,"3/14/04 I enjoyed this brew on tap an Anam Cara. It was served with an immense head. The aroma was quite floral and the foam a delightful mix of sweet and spice. Despite all of the hype, I was blown away by the incredibly balanced and yet incredibly hoppy brew. It was sweet, tangy, fruity, and rich all at once. This beer is smooth, and drinkable. I'd certainly have another. I also ordered the duck quesadilla that was a suggested food pairing. Wow. They were a perfect combination.  7/25/04 -I sampled Randalized 90 minute at the HopHead ThrowDown. While the extra hopping certainly gave the beer an unusually intense mouthfeel - it went straight for my teeth, I wasn't impressed with its overall impact on the flavor. The malt notes seemed to lose definition and complexity.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,CRJMellor,4.47,"Pours a clear amber with a white 1-finger head and nice billowy lace all over the place. Aroma is unbelieveably bitter, almost metallic with a very herbal and resiny hop hit. Feel the dry hop in this one. Flavors includeht of grapefruit, fish oil (yes fish oil) and wonderful pale malt hit. Mouthfeel is slightly sweet front and then a beautiful crescendo of complex hop notes that ranged from some citrus to oily and herbal. Drinkability is great ! Bet you can't have just one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,FranklinPCombs,3.68,"The beer pours a light copper color with a decent head and plenty of draping lace. The smell is on the sweet side, but still has the characteristics expected from an IPA. Huge amount of piny bitter hops is present, with some heavy grapefruits, masking out all malt and yeast smells. The taste is sweet citrus, grapefruit mostly again, with the hops bitterness pushing in immediately afterwards. It has a bit of an earthy mossy taste too. This beer is pushing on being too sweet. The mouthfeel is a tiny bit thick with tons of sharp carbonation which along with the sharp bite of the hops, necessitates the slow drinking of this beer. The 9 cents of alcohol in here are quite evident, so watch out... drink too many of these too quickly, and you might find yourself in a bit of a pickle. This is certainly a testament to the beer making process though, with the 90 minutes of continual hopping advertised plentifully. You can definately see a mix of DFH's 60 and 120 here.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,WesWes,4.47,"The beer pours a cloudy orange/gold color with a 1/4"" off-white head. The aroma is great! It has a really intense bitter/citrousy scent that is pleasant to the nose. The taste is great also. It boasts of mostly pale malts, but the hops are where it's at. There are plenty of them here which fill the beer with a wonderful bitter hop taste. The mouthfeel is perfect. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is the best IPA I've ever had. It has good malt and hop flavor that balances nicely. A great imperial IPA!!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,travolta,4.07,"4-pack, 12oz bottles. 9%ABV!  Apperance: Thick foamy off-white head. Rocky on top. Clear golden applecider in color. Slight lace covering the glass. very petite in shape and form, sticks well.  Nose: Smells like tea at first. Fruit, softer fruits like berries and bananas. Great nose, maybe the best part about the beer; second to ABV.  Taste: Quite hoppy. A little syrupy in the mouth. Bitter at first, but then it calms down and laces your mouth. This brew was a little hott on the tounge at the end.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,necoadam,4.13,At last got my hands on a 4 pack yesterday. Expensive stuff but well worth it. Poured out a dark yellow-orange with quite a bit of carbonation in this brew. Hops hit the nose first with some pine and malts in there as well. Taste was so nicely balanced. Lots of hops at first then mixes with some malts and some fruits mixed in but not that much. Also some oily texture to it with some of that pine taste in there as well. Quite a beer. Lots of lacing was left behind on the glass. The texture and carbonation is so smooth and tasty. I love this stuff.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Crosling,4.26,"Pours a light peach. The head is well developed and thick and leaves a nice coat of lace around my la chouffe tulip.  Nose is spicy. Pine, oily hops and flowers all around in the nose. Not bad.  Many juicy hop tones. The malt is very subdued, providing some body and a backbone but not much flavor. The hops bring tons of grapefruit accompanied by orange and lemon. The alcohol is warming but doesn't produce any flavor at all. Very bitter and quite dry but still very smooth. Delicious DIPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,LuckySevens82,4.41,"12 oz. Bottle (bottled in January 04) Managed to finally find this on in FL. Been looking forward to trying it for some time. Pours a crystal clear gold/amber with little head, I am kind of disappointed at the lack of head actually. I was expecting more. Smells faintly of hops, alcohol and citrus the smell is also kind of dissapointing. Wow, this is one great tasting IIPA. With the lack of smell (which could also be my fault, I've been fighting a cold lately thought it was gone though), and head, I wasn't expecting the unbelievable flavor to come out of this. Lots of hops, smooth for an IIPA, and very little alcohol flavor. This is one of the smoothest IPAs I've ever had, the 60 minute isn't even as mellow as this as far as alcohol characteristic is concerned, the hops balance this ale so nicely it's wonderful. At 9% abv, it's probably not the best of ideas to drink this one all night, but I really could. Overall, this was well worth the wait to try.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,crookedhalo,4.22,"I yearn for the big bottle version agian. This one reviewed from the 12 oz, packaged 12/03. Pours a hazily clouded golden color with lots of orange highlights. Beige head that dies leaving good lacing around the pint glass. Piney, grapefruity, sprucy and floral hop aromas with a touch of honey-like malt sweetness. In a strange sense, this is a really balanced Imperial IPA. When I say that, I mean that it is obviously aggressively hopped, but only retaining small amounts of the ""sweetened iced tea"" malt profile that shows up in a lot of domestic microbrewed pale and IPAs. That is a residual effect of the lupulin and humulin compounds in hops. This beer has minimal qualilties like that because I feel premium hops were used, as well as a well-thought-out grain bill. That's just my take on it. Anyhow, enjoy. it's a really good Imperial IPA, just wish I'd stashed some of the big bottles I'd had of it...",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,GeoffRizzo,4.45,"Hazy peach-fuzz orange, bright, off-white head, still as night, stringy sheets of lacing noticeable. Hops on the nose, the smell equivalent of a nightly plastering of Vicks vapor-rub, a definitive sinus cleanser! Up front, juicy and oily, and oh so tasty. Fresh hop oil, combined with pine, citrus broken down into grapefruit and orange peel. On to the hops; a blast of hops on the tongue, the palate and even felt in the throat, the hop burn is happening here! Malty sweetness, some earthy tones, even some hazelnut tastes buried in the body of this monster. Alcohol presence noted and felt by the third/fourth sip. Take note of the sip portion; another kicked-up-hop monster from the DH crew, another incredible brew, another winner - get some!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,halfpgl,4.74,"Wow! First off is the cap after that its the pour of the copper colored liquid gold. The head holds nicely and clings to the glass sides all the way to the bottom, which comes much to quickly. The hop nose is incredible only matched by the hop flavor. The bitterness is VERY well balance against the malt. This is a superb brew. I anticipate purchasing the 120min since this is such a great beer and the 60-minute is a solid beer without the hoppieness (nose & flavor) of the 90.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,gnaussea,4.24,"Copper orange in color with a moderate, tight bubbled, retentive head. leaves light lace on the glass. Smell, wow. Citrus hops are overpowering. Spicy barley notes are also prominent. Has somewhat of a woodsy feel to it. If you like the nose, let this guy warm up a bit. It only gets stronger from there. Taste: man is that an imperial IPA. Sweet alcohol breaks ground for the flavor, and thos citrus, almost mandarin hops take over, exchanging blows with the maltiness throughout the flavor. A kindof rind-like aftertaste wins out, (it is nearly an unpleasant bitterness.) This is one, nice, bold, strong I.IPA. A winner in my book.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,daledeee,4.7,Poured this beer only to find a minimal head. But the lace NEVER goes away. Those nose is not quite what I like. There is one odor I cannot quantify that I do not like. Other than that there is not one thing I can say bad about this beer. Piney and floral nose(plus the unidentified smell I do not like). Taste is primo. Hoppy and somewhat sweet but not overpowering. Some malt and and lots of grapefruit. A very nice drink that is well balanced. Almost a little menthol?? in the finish. Very nice mouthfeel. The alchohol. Where is it? I bet I will find out.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Jason,4.18,"Presentation: 12 oz bottle with a freshness date.  Appearance: With the massive amount of hops I expect nothing less than a superb lace and that is what I got. A solid ring after every sip ... amazing. Slightly hazed bronze gold color the haze is most likely from the hops.  Smell: Fresh hop aroma, very oily with herbal and piney notes. Ripe fruity esters and some sweet malt in the back.  Taste: This beer is so juicy, what a hop punch it has. Lots of bitterness and a ton of hop oil flavor from front to back. Very smooth with a thick malty body. Nice cake like maltiness in the middle with a ripe fruit and alcoholic kick in the end, finishes a little sweet with lingering bitter hop tones.  Notes: An exceptional example of an American Double IPA, no worries about getting my hop fix here.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,cerevisiaephilus,4.3,"Wow. I like this beer a great deal. Very nice nose. I get a touch of alcohol and a great mellow hop scent, not spicy or citrusy, just nice. A little warm malt on the nose too. This might be my favorite ""imperial IPA"" I've ever tried. Very nicely balanced beer, that is just close enough to extreme in both malt/sweetness and hoppyness that it makes for an interesting and unique beer. Also the typical DFH taste is there. Don't know how to explain it, but I noticed it first in the 60 minute and its here too. Kind of like a ""crunchy"" flavor...nutty kind of. I really like it. Maybe its because of the continual hopping...you get some vegetal flavors...I don't know. It is quite drinkable, but I couldn't do more than 2 or 3 in a sitting. I'm still not sure how to score the drinkability field. But I think this is a bit much. The sweetly smooth hoppyness bothers me after a while.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Todd,4.47,"12oz bottle.  A bit hazy, golden / amber, and topped with a very creamy, enticing looking head. Retention is decent and clingy.  Aroma is full of spicy, floral, herbal, pine-like, pineapple, bready malt and estery characters. Nose is very intricate.  Smooth upfront, big and chewy in the mouthfeel with a creamy palate. Hops are BAM! in your face with prickly, bitter, herbal, pine, citrus rind, salt, slick viscid hop oils, raw leafy hops, earth, resin-like, hints of English cheddar and a touch of soap in a complex and intense medley of characters. Malts are a bit masked by this and take a backseat for most of the drive with some bready flavors and a lot of backseat driving as far as the mouthfeel goes. Alcohol is very present, with a warming feel in the head and fumes in the breath. Light notes of toasted malts / caramel as the beer warms. Dose of yeast in a drying finish.  This beer has really tightened up since its initial release ... of which I was not a fan of.  In the realm of Imperial / Double IPA's, 90 Minute IPA is King ... or at least one of the mighty Kings within its growing empire.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Ieatlambfries,4.22,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle, and exhibiting a nice orange/light copper color. Nearly no head and scant lacing, although that could be a product of my girlfriend washing my beer glass's and not getting all the soap residue off. Oops. The smell of this beer is strangely like canned pineapple. I also thought the same thing about the 120 min IPA. Hmmm. Also a big dose of alcohol fumes as well as some earthy hoppy odors, almost skunk like. The taste is quite earthy and hoppy. Almost too bitter, it leaves your tongue a bit dry. The heavy hop flavor is followed by a weird sweet fruitiness, again canned pineapple is the best way I can describe it. The finish is alcohol and bitterness. The mouthfeel is good, not very carbonated really. Although strangely, it is a bit filling, which brings me to drinkability. Too filling for my taste, I doubt I would drink more than 2, although the unique flavor would bring me back again for seconds. All an all, a nice offering from Dogfish. This is what I expected the 120 to taste like. In fact, to me it actually tasted hoppier than it's big brother.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,sulldaddy,4.13,"I pour this brew from a 12 oz bottle into my pint glass. The color is a slightly hazy orange-yellow. I get a bright white fluffy head to foam up easily. Aroma is all hops, I detect some pine and resin characters, with a mix of sour citrus grapefruit scents. Flavor is similar to the aroma, all hops. Some pine up front which yields to a mild caramel malt hit, this is overtaken by sour hops that carry through the finish. The beer also ends on a slightly dry note, which makes me want to take another sip. This is a tasty IPA, smooth and drinkable throughout the sampling. Not overly hoppy and tasty. Definitely a nice example.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,jtfest,3.58,"With a thin white film of bubbles for a head, the color is a hazy, lightly carbonated golden apricot. The aroma is of sweet barley and alcohol. The alcohol appears again in the aftertaste, but the initial flavor is surprisingly mild and slightly bitter. The mouthfeel is fizzy, sticky and full. It would be a lot more drinkable if the alcohol didn't haunt after the swallow.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,filabrazilia,4.17,"Pours a cloudy copper with a nice white head. Lace drapes the glass like silk curtains.  Prounced malt dominates the nose but is joined by floral hops to create an olfactory delight.  Despite the name, this is not an overly hoppy beer. The rich floral hops are present but do not overwhelm the flavor. I like the balance of malts and hops in the mouth. I could not detect a taste of alcohol.  This is a nice and creamy beer that treats the mouth to pleasing sensations. This is a smooth beer that has a dry hoppy finish. Very smooth and complex.  I enjoyed this beer and believe it to be very drinkable, despite its high ABV. I welcome the chance to try other beers from Dogfish HEad.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Bierguy5,3.99,"Pours a copper color with a nice white head. Smells of sweet, flowery, citrusy hops. Noticable alcohol taste. Sweet malt presence, with a strong wonderful hop bite in the end. Medium body I suppose. In all, a solid IIPA. Not a session beer, but perhaps a good one to sip on while watching CSI as I just did.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,emericanchaos,3.7,pours a clear amber with slight head lasting to the finish.  smells of hops and other fruity florals. alchohol aroma very present.  tastes largely of hops with the presence of other fruityness mixed in between hops and finish. finishes with alchoholic bite which continues to wrestle the hops through the after taste.  amount of alchohol is definetly noticeable. i couldn't help but get a liquor'esque quality from swishing it in my mouth.  much less drinkable then the 60 minute. the alchohol content does not hide in this beer. it's in your face like it or not. i'm still undecided on this part. i had this after a boddinton's and i wasn't feeling straight for the rest of the night (had an arrogant bastard 24oz to take home with me). if you need something of good taste and wish to get drunk pretty swiftly this would be your drink.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Rastacouere,3.52,"This courtesy of hopsrus (thanks!) poured a clear orange body covered by an initially large off-white head that diminishes quickly in a fin du monde glass. Nevertheless, an honest film for a beer of this caliber maintains the position. The smell is floral hops up front with definite orange character. Innocent malt is not absent from that sniff in the form of baked cookies. As it enters the mouth, it's rather ""coating"", thick and velvety as seems usual with dogfish head. First sip is excellent with a sausage+sauerkraut dinner, great combination. I appreciate the difference from all-cascade IPA, but still, the last sips seemed far more boring, one-dimensional, rather tart in mouth and all about agressive (unbalanced) bitterness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is top notch clean though and 9% is nowhere to be found.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,BitteBier,4.23,"Pours a unique, bold golden yellow color. Active carbonation builds a respectable off-white head that subsides into a very fine, clingy lace. Complex hops are prominent in the nose (no surprise!), but there's an earthy, caramely malt scent that lends a pleasant balance. My only complaint about the nose is its relative weakness, even as the beer warms. Hops blanket the tongue nearly from the start with the sweet malt base forming an occasionally-detectable foundation underneath the bitterness and tartness. Finishes with strong alcohol warmth in the very back of the throat and a flavor that reminds me most closely of darkish maple syrup. Despite the intense cling of the hops, the mouthfeel is not overly sticky or syrupy. I love hops bitterness, and I also appreciate balance. I will have this one again, but there are more drinkable IPAs out there.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,mikeys01,4.57,"Poured from a 12oz bottle, the 90 minute is not for the faint hearted. Not quite as overwhelming as the 120, but quite bold in it's own right and infinitely more drinkable, dangerously so. Pours out a faded orange color capped with a tight white head. Aroma is enough to make our mouth water, laden with sweet caramel malt, flowery hops as well as sime piney spice. Taste is not what you expect for an IPA this big, sweet and a bit malty at first, then in march the hops, just a bit sharp and spicy at first then bursting into mixed citrus glory. Very sweet and thick, quite full bodied all the way through. Lots of complexity in the background as well, with hints of oak and vanilla and just the right bitterness. Surprisingly smooth, the 90 minute is quite impressive.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Gasp100,4.32,"Poured out a hazy, burnt orange with a small white head and heavy, heavy lacing down the glass. I believe this is bottle conditioned as well. The smell was of pine and citrus fruit with a definitive astringent alcohol aroma, but it somehow worked for me. The taste was sweet and thick with citrius, tangerine, pine ---- a little bit of everything. This brew was very full bodied and much more balanced as an Imperial IPA than I had imagined. The aftertaste did mellow out a little but overall it was pretty sharp on the tongue. I would give the drinkability factor a little less than perfect just for the sheer ABV factor, but man this was really nice. I love their 60 minute (and think the price difference is only justified between the 60 & 90 if you really need that extra kick. Don't be scared of this brew, I found it more balanced than a lot of the reviews stated.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Strong aroma of hops that include a spicey, as well as floral note. Slight hint of fruitiness. Taste has a very strong character that packs a punch and really hits those tastebuds. A nice dry taste that leaves you thirsting for another sip. The alcohol seemed well masked by the hoppiness. This is a IPA on steriods, I can't imagine what the 120 is like. WOW!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

I noticed a fruity (non citrus) aroma mixed in there. It was ever so light and barely noticeable. The flavor is a very small malt start to a hop mid and finish. The hop flavor is layered and comes to your tongue in waves. At first, I was thinking more pine but then it seemed more citrus. It slowly builds up to a delicious bitter and dry finish. Smooth and clean feel in the mouth and very, very drinkable. This IPA is better than its younger sibling.

There was tons of bottom-carbonation in the glass and the foamy white head was very light and airy. As soon as this beer hits your mouth, it explodes with great hops. At first, it seems as though it may be a little too much, but it balances out perfectly. I can't help it, I am hooked! I cannot wait to try the 60 and 120 minute.

Medium to full body- spicy hop flavors that are somewhat oily on the tongue.

There is a prominent hop aroma, but the bitterness is not as prevalent as some other IPAs, this is probably due to the sweetness from the malts. The high alcohol content is definitely noticeable in the taste. In fact the taste seems, to me, like a very hoppy Belgian Trippel. Even one of these can put you on your ass if you haven't had much to eat.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,BCMan,4.3,It started off w/ a nice pour that immediatly gave off a heavy hop aroma. The color was nearly as dark as the bottle which automatically interested me. The flavor starts off a little sweet and is followed up w/ an awesome hop after taste. This was definetly better than the 60 Minute which seemed less refined. The label stood out in the crowd and gives you a pretty good explanation of what you can expect from theis beer.

My glass of 90 Minute was a clear, light but vibrant red-orange color and had a fine blanketing white head. The smell was loaded with lovely floral hops, numerous citrus notes, and sweet malt undertones...well done. The taste however, was phenomenal. I experienced light sweet honey and peach/nectarine-like maltiness which melded harmoniously with assertive and crisp bitterness. The bitterness isn't near the 100 IBU mark at all, but it is big. The citrusy nose, lightly sweet malts, and the level of bitterness are tuned to each other perfectly. On top of this, the mouthfeel was perfect: full and very silky...wow. I was blown away. I have tried the bottled version, both 750ml (nail man) and small bottles, in the past, but I don't remember it being quite this good. All of the above made for a highly drinkable brew, as the sweetness was well in check, and there was no sign of alcohol. Big flavors but not out of control big. Simply amazing. I think it should be dubbed ""The Nectar of the Gods"".",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

The taste is sweet, malty, with orange peels, alcohol and hints of grapefruit. It is not as overpoweringly bitter as I had originally expected, instead it is maltier than I had thought it would be, even a bit chewey. It had a good bitter finish and pleasant aftertaste.

10099,2093,rajendra82,4.5,"Excellent IPA all around. Dead on mouthfeel with medium orange amber cloudy body, lively carbonation, and strong hoppy aroma. The hops do not overpower the malty goodness. Very juicy citric hop bitterness (grapefruit and orange rinds). The yeast acts as a softening influence to round out the taste. The 9 percent alcohol so well hidden, this would be a dangerous brew for me if it was available locally. This is now my second favorite beer behind Sweetwater IPA from my hometown, Atlanta. Thanks sulldaddy for the trade.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Gavage,4.2,"Poured a partially hazy orange color with a nice sized head. Lacing was produced during the drink. The aroma was very pleasant as strong floral tones were matched only by the sweetness of the malt.  The flavor was bold as the hops were all over the tastebuds, but were also balance with a thick malt. Some orange was detected during the taste but was minor to the hops and malt. The malt rode the tongue long, and the only thing that outran it was the bitterness. Bitterness was evident 2 minutes after swallowing.  The alcohol was noticable, and this is not a session beer. Try one and your tongue will be happy for a while.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Foxman,4.32,"It pours an orangey amber, pretty much the color of honey, hazy and translucent. There's a moderate off-white head, not a whole lot mind you, that quickly settles to thin wisps of bubbles and dainty foam. It laces looking like little cirrus clouds that fade to dots.  First in the aroma is the hops, heavy in citrus fruit and floral and piney. Coexisting nicely is the distinct malt sweetness and some caramel. The aroma is a harbinger of the coming overall fullness and balance.  The hops flavor is a more mild citrus with similarly light floral notes, but the complete hops picture is huge. They slug it out with the prodigious degree of malt sweetness. There's an alcohol presence here that becomes more poignant as the beer warms, making you realize too late just how much alcohol you've already taken in. It finishes with a dry hop sensation as much as flavor, along with a distant note of what I could only call vanilla.  It's medium bodied and coats fully and lingeringly. The malt essense feels chewy in your mouth, and there's a hop tingle as a reminder.  One word...Wow! Like two Titans, the hops go head to head with the malt, but unlike a more literal battle, in this one the two deign to live in a wonderful harmony and blissful balance. This is one very big full beer, not overly complex, with with such strong characteristics and hop/malt combo that you wonder if it was engineered instead of brewed. I like it a lot, and despite its powerful aura, I want to drink a lot, but that high ABV lurks, and once it makes itself known, as much as one beer begs another, common sense dictates that you give this one some respect and ease down.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,DagFishHead,4.32,"Appearance: Copper amber-orange pour capped with a frothy off-white head that leaves creamy lace. Smell: Spicy, citrus/floral hops. Big whiff of alcohol. Sweet caramel malt. Yeasty/earthy notes. Taste & Mouthfeel: Creamy, sweet medium-full bodied malt to start, tight/crisp, almost fizzy carbonation at the top. Slick hop oils and puckery floral and dry hop bitterness/citrus dryness in the finish. Soothing and eventually numbing alcohol warmth. Drinkability: A great IPA style-wise, only the ABV makes it tough to enjoy more than one or two in a session.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,AtLagerHeads,4.05,"Like its draft version this is a decent IPA, but not a great one. This brew lacked appearance and again surprised me by the relative lack of hops aroma as I really expected to be impressed on this measure, which may be more due to acohol content than the hopping quotient. The look on my glass was mid-amber, slightly hazy, with a lazy white head and insignificant lacing. A good taste is had from the citrus hopping and is of a grapefruit and rind nature, followed by some caramel kicking in at the finish. Pleasant mouthfeel and drinkability make this worthwhile as an IPA selection.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,bigbubba,4.2,"This may be the best beer I've had in the hop-till-you-drop category. The color and head are great. The smell is also very good. The balance is exceptional. The hops, malt and alcohol are all cranked up to 10. It is incredibly drinkable but the strength is dangerously masked. Definitely a great beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Edwin,4.73,"Tasted in bottle at Kclinger's Publik House.  Appearance: An awesome looking amber/dark orange color. Good head at first, which fades away into a nice thin layer on top as it warms up a bit.  Smell: Hops, pine, some citrus. An exceptional smell. that actualy made me hungry.  Taste: An absolutely heavenly taste. HOPS bowl you over with some malt and citrus flavor. Almost like the 60 minute on Steroids. This is one full-bodied and great-tasting beer that will bowl you over with flavor and character.  Mouthfeel: Feels good going down. A little bit of an alcohol tinge on the tongue, but nothing offensive.  Drinkability: I could easily have 2 or 3 in a sitting, but then the alcohol would start to do the talking. This is not an all-night beer, but it is a great beer for sampling or sitting at home while enjoying a movie or game.  Try this beer if you can get it. You will thank yourself for it.

Pour briskly. A much bigger glass of head. Cascading bubbles which would do Guinness proud.  Fortunately, things are settling into an orange-gold body with a bit of chill haze, a big frothy white head, and some of the best lacing I've ever seen. Of course, I now have two half glasses of beer, and I haven't had a drop.  Aroma has some nice clean grapefruit, but it is surprisingly subdued. Not the overpowering grove I was expecting. A couple long pulls, and I am surprised again. There is actually balance present. A solid bedrock of malt rolls thru the mouth first, and then the hops arrive, coating the tongue with a pleasant but not biting bitterness. It is thick and rich, and while there is a tingle in the wake, you are not puckered.  I'm not sure of the age of this bottle. DFH was kind enough to notch the month, but skipped the year. I'll have to check with Yen. But at any age, 90 Minute IPA is worth your time.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,steelreign,4.82,"... I am somewhat shocked and at a loss for words. This is the finest in IPA's, suffice to say. This has what the rest does not (typically) which is a balance that is perfect of hop bitterness and malt sweetness. Both are very prominent, and the alcohol is very well hidden. All I can say is, if you're a fan of the style, you would be hard pressed to find another better than this. On draft, it's even better!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Naerhu,4.74,Opaque amber with a spit thin low white head. Massive amount of hoppy spicyness shoots through the nostrils like a chariot pulled by lightening bolts.

10099,2093,Boilermaker88,4.5,"Sampled at the 7th Annual San Diego Strong Ale Festival at the Carlsbad Pizza Port. Poured a hazy amber color with a big lumpy whitish head that faded grudgingly and left large clumps of itself sticking to the glass. The smell was quite different from most other IPAs I had. While it had the classic citrusy hops aroma, the malt aspect was more noticeable. A hint of caramel and fruit kept the aroma from becoming an out of control hops frenzy. The taste was a delicious blend of sweet malt contrasting an intense hoppiness. Initially, the flavors of caramel and maybe honey (I never could quite place that sweet taste) were present but were quickly shown the back seat by the grapefruit peel and some oily pine hops taste. The finish was somewhat bitter but not off the scale. The alcohol was very well camouflaged. The feel was full, creamy and smooth. Wow, that was a damn good beer! Nicely balanced and so smooth, it took a certain degree of willpower to keep from going through that sample at a dangerously fast pace. In fact, this was the only beer I had twice while at the festival. Ill definitely keep on the look-out for this offering from DFH at my local stores.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Head blew up huge then settled down to a sheet across the top. Great lacing. Aroma was nice, lots of citrus especially grapefruit. Of course a boatload of hops. A spicy alcohol aroma is also very noticeable. Taste is full of hops, although it seems very different from hops I've encountered before. Maybe its just a different variety, whatever it is I love it. There is a great balance to this brew. Malt isn't very present yet the hops are not overpowering. A bit thin but very drinkable, although present in the smell the alcohol seems to barely affect the taste. I really wish I could get this here. Awesome brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Nice big hop aroma with notes of citrus, especially grapefruit. Has a smooth body and overall pleasant mouthfeel. Flavor is classic IPA, good hop flavor, citrusy and bitter.

10099,2093,merlin48,4.2,"Pours a hazy amber with an offwhite head. Fragrant and intense on the nose, fruits and pine mostly. Dry, hoppy, and carbonated in the mouth. Nice lacing down the glass as the head trys to stay alive. Raisins and figs are among the complex tastes during the experience, but the hops are always there. Dry, somewhat bitter aftertaste. The Dogfish Head ales continue to confound and mystify me with their complexity. I like the way they push the envelope with their use of hops and malts, and I really like this offering, though it's an unusual taste for an IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,counselor,4.57,"This beer was superb. It poured smooth with a beautiful head, lots of tight bubbles locking up the well balanced carbonation. A shiny burnt amber color beer glistened in the pint glass and contrasted against the 1"" head. The aroma provided an intense display of fruity esters and deep english style hops. The first mouthful revealed loads of complex malty goodness. The malts weighed on the tounge and then as the beer washed over the back of my tounge and throat, some serious hops kicked in and balanced out the mouthfeel like an IPA should. The finish left loads of deep hop bitterness, making me look forward to the next gulp. I could drink this beer all the time if I could afford it (not that it isn't worth the price though).

Appearance: Pours a dark, hazy orange-brown hue with a smallish, off-white head; a good b-cup's worth of lace; decent head retention.  Aroma: Wow, I'm being assaulted; big time hop medley; thick malts in there too; I'm also registering some sort of bizarre, cheese-like quality...  Taste: Again, wow; primary flavor charateristic is that of a thick, fierce hop bitterness; not to worry, though, an equally violent malt backbone is there to balance things out; fairly sweet; spicy, floral hop flavors; same aforementioned, cheese-like quality in there too; a tad phenolic; medium to full body with something of an oily, syrupy mouthfeel.

Pours a light copper color, has a citrus smell to it. Has a nice head, some retention, and a good amount of lace. Sweet fruity hop taste with a nice slight balance of malt.

The 90 Minute is another brew that it outside the box. It is an IPA, with a high ABV, the expected Hops, and much more. Orange - Gold in color with a small head and little lacing. The smell is hoppy with some spice; like the 60 minute, there are some citrus undertones. The taste is hoppy, spicy (I think), with some pine tones (again I think). The taste is complex when you try to peg the flavor, but doesn't confuse when you drink it - it just tastes good. Nice smooth finish. Drinkable, even with the ABV.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,skar,4.3,"12 oz bottle  Appearance/Head: Amber, orange color with a moderate haze. Nice head that lasts.  Aroma: A wonderful array of scents from this beer. Lots of hops with notes of whiskey malt, citrus, medicinal alcohol, and orange. I also noticed a European liquor filled candy-like character.  Taste: A powerful, fruity hop taste. A strong malt backbone provides a nice balance. I noticed toasted almond flavors. It has some sweetness and herbal qualities. This is a rather complex brew.  Bottom line: I've had this beer in the 750mL bottle and on cask before and really loved it. This 12 oz bottle doesn't seem quite as good an example of a powerful yet balanced beer. The nose was excellent, but the taste wasn't quite as impressive as I remember. Don't let that scare you away.

Smell: Nothing but citric, juicy hops with a backdrop of spice and slight alcohol.  Taste: Definitely not one of the most balanced beers I've ever had, but damn it's delicious. Bursts of citric hops . . . grapefruit, pineapple, orange, orange, orange, and even a touch of sweet raspberry? Creaminess fills my mouth and blows my tastebuds, while the 9% abv stings my tongue and reminds me to drink slowly.

The color is superb, a very deep golden yellow in which I can practicialy see the viscosity!? Good creamy beige head with plenty of stick and solid patchwork. Nose is decidedly hoppy, the fruit flies won't leave this one alone. I've got a Ramones CD covering the damn glass. Good mouthfeel, medium bodied with a fine balance of hop and malt to keep things in focus. Long hoppy bud-like finish.

10099,2093,TheLongBeachBum,4.47,"Presentation: Sampled over at the house of fellow BA xlperro during a small get together and a tasting. Just as the picture shows, a 750 Bottle with a very cool looking label. As soon as this baby was opened I was extremely eager to get in some into my tasting tumbler.  Appearance: From the fridge, nicely chilled and relaxed. Deep golden color, which has an orange hue when held to the sunlight. A foamy white head covering is crusty at times and collapses with good lacing.  Nose: Grassy hops, pine needles and hop oils dominate the aromas.  Taste: Lots of Hops; grassy, bitter, fresh & floral. The malt is present throughout the drink. Pine oils are at their strongest in the middle of the beers and support the nose well. BIG tastes, but the strong malts nicely balance the immense hop character to the point where this is highly drinkable and easily downed.  Mouthfeel: Very Solid. Malts are slickly lubricated with the hop oils which nicely coat the tongue and add to the lingering bitter-sweet finish. Where ever the hell the alcohol is  its well camouflaged.  Drinkability: Bring it on. A fantastic Big Ass Beer that has thick deep Malt foundations covered in a Hoppy honeycomb Scaffolding structure. I must get some more of this beauty. Fantastic.  Overall: Wow, 9%, 90 IBUs and definitely one of the Great IPAs.  A Huge Hoppy Thanks to Xlperro for putting this on at his recent Beer (Cheese, Stone-Porter-soaked-Wurst and Hot Mustard) Tasting. Awesome.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,CBFanWish,4.63,"This could be the greatest beer I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. The deep golden color led to a foamy head that stayed with me to the very end. I enjoyed the aroma of pine and hops, but it was the taste. Oh my god. The taste was a little bit of heaven. hoppy, but not overpowering. They added just enough enough malt to balance the emense amounts of hops in each glass. It had a sweet aftertase that I actually found very pleasant, I usually don't enjoy the sweet all too much, but this time it was just right. Did I say how smooth this beer was? I'm giving Dogfish a 5 in mouthfeel because it was so smooth. It was smooth like the finest silk. As smooth Barry White, as smooth as... you get the idea.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,ithacabaron,3.3,"Twelve ounce bottle, purchased as single from the Finger Lakes Beverage Center.  A bit of anticipation going into this one...appearence is deep lemony orange, and a nice head rises and settles at the top of the pint glass.  Very hoppy aroma, with distinct pine and spruce notes to go with the expected citrusness.  Taste is full of hops, but not overwhelming -- the hops are mellow and soft as they hit the tongue. Malt profile is there, but subtle, nowhere near the ""rediculous amount of malt"" promised on the bottle. This is especially strange because of the high ABV. Don't get me wrong, this beer will warm you up...it just doesn't have the mouthfeel of a 9.0% beer.  The finish is hoppy and dry, but doesn't lead you into another sip. If anything, this just kind of sat on my tongue.  Overall, certainly a beer I'd have again, but for the cost, and overall, a better ultra-hop beer, I'd rather purchase twice as much Hop Devil for the same price.  Just seems like there wasn't that much thought put into this...just a hell of a lot of hops thrown together with some malt into a brew kettle.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,HonestWeightBeer,4.7,"Pours a crystal clear deep gold with orange and ruby notes w/ 2 inches of bubbly, creamy, craggy head produced by ample carbonation. Good retention and lacing, all the way down the glass.  Smells of resinous, floral hops, alcoholic esters, citric acid and the deep evergreen woods.  Taste is slightly grainy, but hoppy, both bitter and full flavored. Hop oils and alcohol meet in heaven, I mean, in my mouth. A flavor explosion, floral and bitter, emphasis on bitter. A good mix of grain/ alcohol sweet and citrus, hop oils. Strong, but reserved, this doesn't hit you over the head, just warms your belly and sticks a bit on your tongue.  Mouthfeel is round and slick, slightly sticky, acidic, and lasts.  As a fan of heavy hopping, I think this is quite delicious, not too strong, nor too alcoholic, nor too sweet, nor too bitter. For a beer this strong, quite drinkable. Realistically, one wouldn't want to start a tasting session with it, but if hops are your cup of tea (mmmm.. hop tea!) this is a great IPA. Not exactly true to the English style, but true to DFH style, quality all the way.. an excellent brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,RoyalT,4.38,"Appearance  Nice, beautiful head that rose up nicely, went down slow, and laced the glass. The body is a lovely orange that screams, IPA.  Smell  What do we have here? Did I inadvertently find one of the big boys? This beer reeks of piney hops. We have a lot of evergreen trees in Washington State, and this smells like Ive rolled in the needles for a few hours. I mean, I cant even explain how strong and sharp this is.  Once you get past that, there are some other, softer, more floral hops and actually some sort of malt in there for balance. But, I think Im going to nickname this one, The Pine Tree.  Taste  Man, is this sharp. This is like IPA concentrate. Add 1 Tablespoon to 12 ounces of water and, Poof, youve got an IPA. This is extreme hops at their best. The super-strong hop flavors give this one yet another nickname: The Rind & Pine.  Interestingly, the malt balance is very clear. Its more of a grainy barley malt, but its there in force. This is amazing considering the preponderance of this ale to hops.  The taste of this ale will inevitably be compared to The Ruination, so lets get this out of the way. The Ruination is more refined. It is more balanced. It is more user-friendly. But, the 90 Minute IPA will stand your hair on ends. If the Ruination is the King, this is his crazy brother living in exile tenaciously dedicated to overthrowing the crown.  Mouthfeel  This DFH is medium to full bodied, lightly carbonated, very smooth, and has terrific balance.  Drinkability  This is a real treat. Drink it the way it is or age it for a few months to mellow out the hops.  Update  I first reviewed this a month after joining the site. It has become one of my regular buys but thought it would be fun to re-review it with an 04 vintage. I juggled a few of the scores around a bit but basically Id write the review the same way. This is one damn good ADIPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,silks636,3.37,"Poured from a 12 oz. brown bottle. Label notched 6/03.  Cloudy gold with very thick ivory head. Huge sheets of lacing cling to the glass. Wonderful sweet citric aroma, a slight tinge of pear and a bit of alcohol. Taste starts off pleasantly sweet and fruity with a subtle wave of malt. The alcohol becomes evident and then the hops smacks you across the face. Very complex mix of bitterness and sweetness overwhelms the palate. Any trace of malt is buried in the tremendous onslaught of earthy hops. Mouthfeel is slick and syrupy. Finish is surprisingly crisp with a refreshing fruity aftertaste.  Very interesting, but not one I could drink more than one at a sitting. Might be a little too extreme for its own good. It would probably benefit from a little aging... will put a bottle aside for a later date.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,indiapaleale,3.62,"It looks like an IPA, it smells of nice sharp hops, but the taste is less than rewarding (considering the high cost for big bottles and 4-packs). A little watery/oily. High ABV does make for a nice warming feeling though.

10099,2093,ManekiNeko,3.8,"Served chilled in a pint glass. 12 oz. bottle brewed either in May or June '03.  Appearance: Vaguely hazy, honery colored liquid topped by a modest head. Head shrinks to a crown rather abruptly, but the lacing is purty good.  Smell: Not as much bitter pininess as I was expecting. I was aexpecting pain, and got a gentle caress.  Taste: Surprisingly laid back. Largely sprucy bitter hops with a nice pale and caramel malt backing. Either I'm getting used to hop monsters or the bottle is old.. but given the ABV and the bottled date.. not likely. I did have the 750 mL version about a year ago, and I remember it being monstrously bitter. Even my hophead brother was goin' ""Damn!"" I'm guessing something changed, but this is still good.  Mouthfeel: Fullish bodied, with the alcohol presence very well masked. I can't believe this is 9%!!!  Drinkability: Rather drinkable, dangerously so given the high ABV.  Other: Dogfish Head doesn't get much love in the top 50, but they make some distinctive and adventuresome beers. I believe their distribution within the USA is pretty good, so most of the American BA-ers should be able to get this, or any of their products. This one is definitely worth trying to get.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Globetrotter,3.92,"Hand delivered to Moscow by a colleague from Washington DC, this brew helped bring me back to my IPA roots. A few more of these and I'll be pretty darn homesick. I got a standard brown 12oz. bottle with a label that didn't look anything like the BA picture (mind featured a fish, rather than the man/hammer/nail/forehead combo). Oh well. No ingredients list or freshness info.  Poured an interesting orange gold under s small off-white head that faded to film quite quickly. That film stuck around a long time, though, generating some marvelous lacework. I detected a nice strong hoppy nose with hints of flower and spice. The mouth was prickly and fairly heavy. Lots of hoppy bitter and flower dominate from the start, balance somewhat by a touch of citrus and a dash of malt. There's a good crisp bite in the finish, leaving a bitter, refreshing aftertaste.

10099,2093,Gueuzedude,3.8,"Sampled July 2004 A nice strong citrus & pine aroma wafts to my nose as I pour this beer. It pours a deep copper color and is quite clear. The head is quite large and it a tan color. As I take a couple of sniffs I get a strong note of candied orange peel, lychee, grapefruit, apricot, and some pine needles. The taste tells me that thankfully this is a fresh bottle. The taste is sweet up front, and is pretty much all hops. The beer is much less hoppy than your typical west coast hop monster. Never-the-less this is quite hoppy, with a candied fruitiness in the mouth. The finish has a hint of harshness from the mixture of alcohol and hops, a sort of raw hop type astringency that clings to my mouth in the finish. I really like the front half of this beer, it is like sucking on a candied hop lollipop. This is quite tasty, yet is still missing that certain something to really make this great.  Sampled August 2003 Pours brilliantly clear. This beer is an amber color with a pale tan head. The aroma is of American hops; floral and grapefruity. It smells a bit sweet as well. It tastes citrusy with a sweet maltiness to it. Finished by a solid bitterness. This beer tastes strong with a bit of alcohol in the finish. There seems to be something missing to make this a great beer, nothing wrong with it, just seems to be missing something that could push it over the edge.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

But in the now happens to be a Dogfish Head 90 minute Imperial IPA, well four of them at 12 ounces each. Rather clear it seems to be in the glass, only a slight haziness, no cloudiness at all. A straight up fundamental hops aroma kicks some nice ass. Kind of syrupy but not really....very drinkable for 9% ABV. The hops is kinda fruity at first, but it doesn't last long before a total onslaught of blunt hops force beckons the devil upon the buds of taste. This process is an addicting one which makes this one heluva IPA. Dogfish Head is the best thing to ever come out of Delaware, except maybe Dover Downs.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Winter,3.33,"12 oz bottle. Pours a hazy amber in color with a white head that retreats pretty quickly to a mere ring around the side of the glass. Aroma of piney hops, malt and alcohol. Medium-bodied with a very sharp carbonation that stabs at the tongue. Malt and biscuit can be detected early on. There's a subtle fruitiness that lingers and then gets stomped on by the citrusy hops. Nothing about the taste really stands out in particular, other than the hop bitterness. Supporting cast of flavors are lacking in complexity. The Imperial I.P.A concept seems stretched a bit thin here and sacrifices flavor in the process. I'm glad I tried it, for it's not a terrible beer, but nothing outstanding either.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,nixhecks,4.16,"I couldn't wait to try this one so I didn't mind spending the $9 per 4pack. Poured a glowing, light amber color with a frothy white, pancake head that had real food retention - the perfect looking brew. The smell is great while not being to obtrusive, mainly a floral aroma with piney notes and a slightly sweet, candy-alcohol aroma. The taste was very well balanced, not overly hoppy like some of the ""hop-crazy"" brews I have seen around this summer. This almost had a barley-wine type of taste to it, with the sweet barley flavors in the aftertaste rather than an extreme hop bitterness. The mouthfeel was also nice - very full and smooth. A great beer, one of the best I have had in a while. By the way, the head is still there.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,xgrigorix,3.7,"Twelve ounce brown bottle. Month of bottling is notched on label.  Glowing amber / bronze colour, clear, with a creamy looking off white head. The head stuck around for a while, and left tons of lace behind.  The nose is filled with bright citrusy hop aromas.  An impressive biscuity English malt flavour is followed up by a bit of caramel. Finishes pleasantly dry, with an intense citrusy hop finish. Just a touch of pine needles at the end.  Smooth, medium bodied, with gentle carbonation.  This is incredibly balanced for a 9% ABV & 90 IBU's of hoppy goodness. I actually think its too balanced. I wish there was something else going on, some sort of ""character flaw"" that would make this distinctive & memorable. It is pretty intense while still being pretty straight laced.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,GreatPondBrewer,3.62,"The so-called Imperial IPA and second in a three series for Dogfish Head. I really liked the 60 minute and was excited to taste the 90 minute. It poured a hazy copper color with very little in the way of a head. There was a white head for a short time, but that receded very quickly into some errant pockets of cubble clinging to the edge of the glass. Smell had nots of serious bitter hops plenty of alcoholic esters, maple syrup, brandy and pears. Taste was pretty darn good as well. Huge amount of hops thrown int with a ton of alcohol, which was not extremly well hidden, malts were almost non existent as was carbonations. I am not sure where it went to. All in all I liked the 60 Minute a lot better, and also like other ""Imperial"" IPAs such as Rogue's and the Dreadnaught better, but this was worth the money spent. Check this one out.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,nomad,4.2,"Poured a slightly muddled moderate orange color. Had a nice barely off-white foam head, even and sitting well. Lace began wide and even then gracefully fell to thousands of little islands of slowly falling foam. This beer badly wanted to leave stain.  Smelled of honey poured over grapefruit, pine with an occasional antiseptic tinge to it, though these do eventually subside. Calmed into more of a rosy sweetness that came with time; it is the product of tons of two-row malt covered in the fruity tones of high hop content. Some dry cooking herb scents too, and alcohol thinly washes over all of the above.  Taste was of a truly flavorful bitter first and foremost, as its power took a little bit of time for adjustment. Sweet and sour rosy fruitiness sneaked up from underneath in time, though it was a quick flavor. Noticed a grainy textured feeling to the taste of the bitterness, shading toward earthy. But, it was still very juicy beer after many sips. Fully earthy bitterness did finally come through out the long finish.  Pretty thick mouthfeel for the style, a bit slick, almost luxuriant. Definite pine presence when I burped. A beer to slowly behold or youll miss its many layers. More complex than its sixty minute little brother, but that does not make it tremendously better just different.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,WanderingFool,4.37,"12oz bottle. The beer is a nice clear light copper color with a fluffy white head that dissolves to a thick ring around the surface. Some spots of lace are left clinging to the side of the glass as it empties. An aroma of strong flowery hoppy esters, citrus notes, toasted malt and yeast floats above the beer. Each sip of this medium to full bodied beer is smooth and delicious. The flavor begins hoppy with a strong citrus taste. A caramel malt flavor holds things together before the bitterness returns for the finish. A bitter sweet taste is left behind.  This is a very flavorful tasty beer that a hop head should love. It's not as drinkable as other IPA's and may scare away a ""novice"" beer drinker.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,beerguy101,3.84,"Deep orange color, medium head. Aroma is floral and herbal, touch of grapefruit. A big bold malty and hoppy IPA. Very smooth taste. The over malting is balanced by the extreme over hopping. At 9% alcohol and 90 IBU, you would expect this beer to be much harsher and stronger tasting. It is surprising in it mellowness and subtly. Malts have a touch of fruitiness and sweetness to them. Hops are dominant and are floral and slightly spicy. Complex flavors. Thick taste, thick I will be picking hops otta my teeth for a couple of days. Grapefruit flavor intensifies as it warms. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. It took forever, several tools and a corkscrew to get the cork out, but it was worth it. Figured the 90 minutes was how long it took me to open this one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,jtw5877,4.47,"Appearance is par for the course for a pale ale, but the similarities end there. This is a great beer. Super juicy hops that just wrap themselves around your tastebuds and fill you with pleasure. As you can see I love this stuff. A strong, but oh so smooth beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,taez555,4.5,"12oz bottle  This beer poured a very clear redish/amber/mahogony body with a very thick white head.  The nose was very inviting. Lemon, grapefruit, lots of citrus, spice, some malt, some other slight fruityness.  The taste was very full bodied and fruity. Lots of citrus, grapefruit. But not an overly grapefruit peel taste like most hoppy beers. This was all grapefruit flavor, with some other fruits, apples and pears mostly. Just some hints at the citrus peel. Very sweet maltyness. Caramel malt with a sugary sweetness. An even, very tight, hop bitterness sat in the background.  The beer ended with a very long, but extremely smooth, hop bitterness.  Overall I found this beer very enjoyable and easy to drink. You can barely tell it's 9% alcohol which makes it rather dangerous. What was really interesting was how subdued the hops were in this beer. For a 90 minute IPA I was expecting to get knocked down by hops, but they were there and just sat nicely with the malts. Great beer, one I'll deffinatly be reaching for again.  One key side note, I've found this tastes very different depending on the bottle size or on tap.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,UnionMade,3.47,"Had this on tap at My Place restaurant in Newtown, CT. Pours a golden amber color, with a thick white head. Great head retention lasting all the way through the beer. I was expecting it to be a little darker, but this'll do. Aroma is a strange understated hoppiness, much less than i expected, with a significant alcohol presence, plenty of malt, with some fruity esters, mainly pear, plum, and fig. The flavor starts out brutally hoppy, but as your palate adjusts, becomes much maltier and more complex. Hops are interesting, appearing all the way through the sip. They start out sort of citric, then become more herbal when coupled with the alcohol in the finish. A vague pine-like woody feel to the beer, with plenty of alcohol presence. The malts are very much like single malt scotch, with that overwhelming sweetness, and a touch of peat. This beer got extremely sweet by the end of the glass, with the hops only appearing in the very beginning of the sip, and tapering off quickly to a very alcoholic maltiness. It's a good beer, but definitely something for special occassions. I don't think it has a great drinkability, because it starts off pretty hoppy and ends with an almost single malt sweetness. Overwhelming each way. Could be a wonderful after dinner beer after a great meal.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,pbrian,3.4,"750 ml, aged about 2 years  Last night I decided to crack my bottle of this. Now normally I wait 'till a relaxing time after the kids are in bed and the chores are all done to crack bottles from the cellar. The problem is, that stuff's all not done until after 10:30 lately so those cellar dwellers never get consumed. So last night I said screw it. My wife took off when I got home for some ""ladies night out"" type thing so I went to the downstairs fridge for my own ""guy night in"" type thing. I open the bottle, pour it in my snifter and... this all happens at once now... my 3 year old, who's spinning in circles, cracks her noggin on the corner of the counter top and drops to the floor bleeding, my 4 yr old is in the bathroom screaming for me to wipe her butt, and to top it off, my 6 mo old, who is enjoying the mayhem from the perch of the backpack, decides this would be a great time to puke on my neck. I kid you not. After a bit of damage control (Carly was fine) I get to drink my beer. My impressions-  The smallish head settled quickly to a wisp of bubbles around the edge. The aroma, as expected from an aged version, was a subdued piney hops, honeyish malt and fusel alcohol. The front of the beer is slightly sweet but that doesn't last long. The middle and end blur together as a hop and alcohol assault on the tongue. A saving grace was a drier finish than you would expect. Overall I found it a bit harsh. Even after 2 years in the bottle, I found the fusel alcohol/burning bitterness characteristics a bit overwhelming. I don't expect IIPAs to be the most balanced beers out there, but I expect them to be drinkable. I've had many that were better than this. The first couple of glasses were OK, but it became a bit of a chore after that. I think a cleaner, more balanced 12 oz version would be more appropriate.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,aaronh,4.73,"12 oz. bottle  A slightly hazy copper colored body is accented by amber highlights. A casual pour results in a half-inch vanilla cream head that slowly fades to a thin layer of foam. Wisps of a sweet floral aroma are evident from a distance. Up close, the strong hoppy aroma has both citrus notes and very strong florals that combine with the malt to bring images of bubble gum to mind. The taste catches me off guard, as the powerful malt sweetness sends my head spinning. I'm becoming a bit of a hop lover, but malt is my first love. The sweet fruity malt gives way to a great floral hop taste the ends with just a touch of a honey note. Biscuity malt notes, orange flavored honey, a touch of pine, ooooh this is gooood! The mouthfeel is very full, but not thick in any way. Drinkability is too good, as I just noticed this was a 9% ABV brew! I was thniking I needed a case of this stuff, but realizing what I paid for one that may not be in the cards. Plus, I'd probably be snookered all the time becuase this stuff is excellent. Sam and the crew at Dogfish Head can really make a mean IPA. Actually, they make at least three. And this one is the best of the lot. If you see it, buy it.

10099,2093,OldFrothingSlosh,4.5,"Presentation: 1pt 9.6 oz bottle. $6.49 at Carytown Wine & Beer. Non-readable ""Packaged In"" stamping on the side with one *seriously* ugly dude on the the front. Pulled it from the fridge after about one month.  Appearance: Champagne-type covering over a cork stopper. A little oomph! and the cork came righ out. Rather thin neck of the bottle made for a slow pour, though the head was very thick and rocky. Settled to a thin layer atop the beer. Awesome saturation of the entire glass with lace as I consumed it. The color of the beer was a cloudy dull orange color.  Smell: Distinct pine notes in the aroma. Somewhat of an ""earthy"" aroma is also evident.  Taste: This is one smooth-tasting brew. Despite the explicit warnings on the label (90 IBU...now available in this handy economy size), it was so very nicely balanced. I really expected a over-hopped flavor, but due to the balancing by ""a ridiculous amount of English Two-row Barley"", the flavor is excellent. Not as ""in your face"" as an even more aggressively hopped beer (like Ruination IPA). The flavors are defninitely on the ""big"" side...no mild flavors to be had here.  Mouthfeel: In reading other reviews, I had expected a more pronounced alcohol flavor. I just didn't notice it. The first glass went down very quickly and I tired to savor the second one. I really noticed an ""oily"" character near the end of the end of the swallow...lingering on the palate and even coating the lips. Rather high amount of carbonation still yielded a fairly creamy mouthfeel. Very pleasing.  Drinkability: The wife was amazed at how quickly this bottle disappeared (""My God! That's a WINE bottle you just drank!""). A very drinkable beer....dangerously so given that the alcohol content really wasn't that discernable to me.  Overall, just slightly behind Stone's Ruination IPA in my book. Given my love for the hop, others may find this more agreeable due to its excellent balanced flavor. Time to buy another bottle and let it sit for awhile.  7/23/03 -- Review of the 12oz. bottle.  If anything, the taste and drinkability go up a notch. IMHO, better than the larger size. Smoother, a tad sweeter, and *very* easy to drink. I also feel that it is easier on the palate than the 60-minute IPA. An excellent beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,StevieW,3.81,"Big 1 pint 9 oz brown bottle with cork and cage. The label had a guy hammering a nail into his head. Also some descriptions about the hop process. I poued it into two pint glasses and shared a few ounces with a friend. Glowing burnt orange color, golden tinge almost. An inspiring view and almost magical looking. Big, sticky off-white head. Super charged whole leaf hop aromas. Wow, smacks you right in the nose Hello ! Citrus, and grass dominate the nose, almost like a wood chipper. First taste is super charged hop bitterness as expected. Mouth puckering bitterness matched with a nice citrus charge. High abv seemed to make a presence causing more of a heat and slickness than I wanted from an IPA. I think this detracts from the enjoyment a bit, and drinkability for me. I had it with dinner and maybe it's better suited as a sipping beer, as I know see the website suggests. Certainly an extreme beer, but so far in my experience I would choose the Stone IPA over this one. I think this goes a little too far to be an experience in itself, and crashes your tastebuds into submission.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,jreitman,4.5,"Boy howdy is this one full of hops. Aroma of centeniall and cascade jumped right out of the glass and made sure you knew what you were getting into. Copper amber in color with lots of off-white head. Aroma and flavor of grassy hops were most dominant but the brew had plenty of malt to make sure the beer did not get out of whack.

I tend to like my beers a bit ""bigger""overall and this is right up my alley.

Aroma is full of citrus notes and pine sap, no doubt the hops are in there. This has a unique hop profile you'll find in no other beer. Citrousy (almost like over-ripe fruit) hop taste that is balanced fairly well with a slightly sweet maltiness. This beer definitely makes your tongue pucker, much like grapefruit juice  I edited this from 2003, when I apparently thought this had too great an alcohol taste going on. Not so much these days - one of best, most flavorful beers out there.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,EmoBeerGuy,3.52,"Heard very good things about this IPA...  When I ordered it I just said Dogfishead to my server (they only have one tap at my pub) and when it came back I was confused because I was exspecting another beer (they had changed the tap).  At first I thought I had been given a Sierra Nevada by mistake, but then realized that the beer I was drinking was much harsher with not as crisp a finish as the Sierra. It was not till later that I realized this was likely due to the extra ABV.  This on had a decent head. Taste is basically totally derived from the hops and alcohol. This was the first IPA in a long while to make me slightly wince as I took it down. The wincing stop as I got more of this brew into me but I can't help but think that this one is not balanced completely correctly. Not bad, but I wouldn't seek it out.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Leaves incredible stringy lace in drippy rings. Smell is all peachy, a bit citrusy and a piney/woodish backing, somewhat earthy, soft but nice and rich of hops galore. Taste is wildly smooth and soothing of peachy/citrus hops, one hell of a nice bittering effect thats very calm and easy. Some light earthy tones dotted in the mix with a blend of well balanced malts, gotta keep those hops in check, I suppose. Feel is full and quite bittering in a mild sense, in which it doesn't linger to much to be over the top in any way. This is quite excellent stuff, I don't care that its 9%, which is masked beautifully by the way, its way to damn easy to drink, which makes for a short evening.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Dantes,4.5,"Package: 1 pint, 9.6oz. corked and caged brown bottle. Label scored at 04. Picture of a fellow hammering a nail into his nose. Description of continuous hopping process.  Cost: $4.99 per bottle at Bottle King  Served: Snifter at ~45º  Appearance: Poured an almost toffee-colored body with an off-white, voluminous, long-lived head, which was surprising for a relatively high ABV IPA.  Smell: Sweetly, resinously piney in the classic DFH Brewing style. Not overwhelmingly hoppy, with some malt and grain aromas sneaking through. Almost like an extreme version of Rogue&#8217;s Brutal Bitter.  Taste: Dogfish does it again. This full-bodied IPA really hits all of the right spots. While assertively hoppy, it also exhibits malty elements, earthiness, and even a faint sweet fruitiness that reminded me of apricot or peach nectar. It is this relative balance that belies the degree of hoppiness. I found it to be more akin to Three Floyds&#8217; Dreadnaught than the Alpha King or Stone&#8217;s Ruination.  Mouthfeel: The long-lasting, dense head attested to its nice level of carbonation, relieving the relatively heavy body. Super-smooth, with a buttery, caramelized feel to it, resulting in a very long, sweetish finish. Sweetness lengthens as the beer warms. Warming.  Drinkability: Another shockingly quaffable beer that is relatively high in ABV. Practically verges on being a session beer. I had no problem finishing the bottle at each sitting.  I had bought two bottles of this to start (one to drink, one to age), but after trying one, I bought the others that I could find, knowing I would drink them whenever possible. I thought I might not like it, as I tend to avoid beers that seem to be about the IBU&#8217;s, but this one is much more than that. My experience with the 90 Minute made me eager to try the 60 Minute, which I found to be one-dimensional and disappointing. I have not had the opportunity to have the Dreadnaught more than twice or some of the other highly rated ones (Racer X, Alesmith), but so far, this one ranks near the top, with the slightest edge going to Dreadnaught since I prefer draught.  Bottom Line: One of my favorite &#8220;extreme&#8221; IPA&#8217;s.  NB: Limited experience leads me to believe that the corked bottles are superior to the 12oz. bottles, although age may be a factor.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Nice blend of English barley and American-hops, especially the prominence of the Cascades for that grapefruity zing balanced by the sweet malt.

Also, thanks to the reviewer of World of Beverages in Norwalk, as I took a ride over and found this winner, along with Allagash Summer White. I'll be driving over tomorrow to get some more. FYI - I did not find the 9% ABV an issue - didn't even know it was that high until I read the bottle later.

10099,2093,Thrasher,3.73,"25 oz bottle, date 10/02. I don't know if this beer has mellowed in the past 7 months, but I found it pretty mild considering the hype. I have also tried 60 Min and 120 Min (both very fresh) and thought they were much more intense. This sample actually seems like your run of the mill IPA. Not too hoppy, not too alcoholic. Maybe that is the trick; maybe after a few more sips I will be schnockered, with my tongue stripped to ribbons by the hops, and the only recourse left is to hammer nails into my skull. Dark gold, bordering on amber with huge white head that lasts and laces. Aroma was the most surprising part; it was remarkably subtle and much less hoppy than other reviewers have indicated. Perhaps that is a result of the small amount of aging it has received. Trademark DH sweet malts that actually seem very un-beer-like; closer to Dr Pepper or gingerbread or something. Hops are there, for sure: tangy, bitter, not particularly dry and not especially huge. A tasty brew, for sure, but maybe the DH hype has gotten a little too carried away with this one. They make several beers far superior to this.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

There is about 1 finger of head that dies down to a small line quickly, but leaves a little lace on the glass. The smell is a mixture of hops and citrus. The taste has just a little bit more of a hoppy tang than the 60 min. A hint of orange is in there somewhere underneath all the hops. The mouthfeel is very strong, yet smooth.

It pours a cloudy amber/brown with a foamy slightly off white head. Aromas are pleasing, floral and citrus. Some alcohol presence. Mouthful is satisfying. Taste is hoppy at first, followed by a very nice sweet malt presence. Finish is back to lasting bitter hops with an alcohol warmth. The malt seems to present itself more as it warms.  What an excellent IPA. There is also a good malt presence that is well balanced with the hops.

The appearance, quite striking, is cloudy orange, with a full, creamy head. The powerful nose on this one is almost overwhelming at first, but shows its many sides as the beer warms. Initially it is like I'm snorting a handful of hops, but eventually a distinctivey orange-juice aroma begins to dominate -- very nice. It is followed toward the end of the beer by a piney, almost 'pine-sol'-like smell. The flavor is marked primarily by leafy hops, with notes of bitter grapefruit and green tea. Sugary malts are presented mid-palate, in the effort to balance out the sharp hop flavor, and they fade back into the bitterness of the finish.

The mouthfeel is very much the same as Dogfish Head's others--thick and sugary.  Seeing the man hammering a nail into his nose on the label gave me the impression this beer was nothing short of demonic. I won't say it's tame or anything but it's pretty much exactly how I'd imagine a Dogfish Head IPA. The alcohol content is definitely not the tough guy it thinks it is.  This is a good beer.

As a self-proclaimed 'hophead' I dare say that this very high hopped brew was well balanced. Great beer that's remarkably drinkable. I've had this the the 750ml corked bottle and the 12oz bottle. Both very good, just sorry they didn't carry over the nice artwork from the 750ml to the 12oz.

Lucky me got this in a pint instead of the 10.5 pour, nice light orange color, little bit of head, but that lace stayed with me for the whole glass.  Very pleasantly surprised at the balance and drinkability of this beer. This beer did not scream out hops to me...yes, they are there, but the malt is right there with it, that no one strong flavor prevails. One of the best 'strong' IPAs I've had. The alcohol is deceptive, although might explain how giggly I was later that evening. Although it was delicious, I luckily went with something else after.  Very good beer, definitely one I'd have again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,stirgy,4.65,"Wow! what a beer. This one poured out a very bright and clear orange-copper color with a big head that left nice lacing on the glass. Intense grassy and pungent aroma. I can only imagine the amount of hops steeped in this beer - it must have been quite alot to come up with an aroma like this. The sweet malt graininess and alcohol is matched almost perfectly with the hops. Detecting some grapefruit and lemon/lime coming through. Full bodied and full flavored, this beer is suprisingly drinkable and finishes clean. A definite treat and a beautifully made beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Some biggish bubbles explode in the middle of the dense, cream-colored, medium-sized head. A sticky film of lacing doesn't look like it will be easy to scrub off the glass. The beer is a clear, deep amber. Some very fine sediment appears on the last pour. (Of course, by the last pour from this big bottle of big beer, everything's starting to look a little grainy).  There are enough hops in the nose. Fresh, stewed hops. Slightly metallic, a little pepper, a little strong tea. A tiny bit of dark fruity sweetness pokes through the juicy tobacco hops in the front. Some spice and a touch of far-off smoke (the alcohol, maybe?). I taste a bit of apple in the middle, but mostly a ton of creamy malt giving the hops a run for their money. In the end, though, the hops take The Cup, leaving a hugely bitter finish. The alcohol is well hidden, I think, appearing mostly as heat and a little metal in the finish. Overall: wow. This beer is huge.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Head is moderate, lacing is excellent.  Aroma is sweeter than expected, with citrus and fruit mixed in.  The first sip is a shock. A nice shock, but a shock, nevertheless. The hops are there, but the sweetness, the creamy, chewy, glossy sweetness, is predominant. Not the hard, clubby sweetness of a barleywine, but something lighter and more frothy. The butterscotch image returns -- it's like butterscotch served on a hops platter.  I am not sure in which style this beer belongs; yes, it's an IPA, OK, I guess -- but the creamy, fruity, complexity of it seems at least to put its foot out of the IPA tent. No matter.

Prickly piney, citrusy hops nose, potent but almost extraordinary very inviting. The beer is surprisingly balanced, yes; the hops dominate seemingly equally piney as it is citrusy, some floral... somewhat oily. But the malt foundation really makes this beer drinkable. The mouthfeel is simply perfect, smooth, creamy, subtle carbonation. The finish is sweet faintly bitter, well-rounded but too abrupt for such a big beer. The 9% abv is well hidden in the taste; a tremendous accomplishment but you can feel the abv on the brain and belly. This beer is very good, very complex yet very drinkable. I recommend it.

Big malt body. Smooth for a beer of this magnitude. Alcohol is well hidden.  Good mouthfeel. Medium to full body. Very drinkable for a beer with it's high alcohol and hops content. Slight mouth puckering only at the finish.  Overall, a very good beer, but it just didn't wow me.

The head retention is decent, and the foam creates a nice lace around the glass.  The aroma is wonderful. Its a very full hop smell. The smell is strong, but not off putting, most likely due to the choice in hops. The taste is citrusy and clean. The malt profile is hard to describe, but its somewhat sweet, which compliments the aroma and bitterness well.

Nose is strong fresh pine and cedar blended with lots of floral hops and leaves no doubt that youre in for an extreme brew. Medium to full-bodied with a slick mouthfeel due to all the hop oils. Taste is sweet fruity alcohol at first quickly replaced by tons of bitterness. Grapefruit rind flavors combined with raw hop resins and tannins make your mouth pucker but still crave another sip. Strong bitterness remains in a lasting aftertaste. A thoroughly enjoyable IPA and an absolute must-try for any and all hop-heads.

The aroma is all that I expect from a top-notch IPA. Spicey and hoppy at the nose, but the smell is just the beginning.  The taste is something almost god-like. It is hoppy and spicey. Almost fruity, but without taking that next all-too-fruity-step.  In ever lightly lacey head i sappealing, but I am thinking flavor and aroma all the way. A great beer to try, but beware. Hopheads only need apply. A very good brew. Prost!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,brakspear,3.57,"An Imperial IPA does not necessarily mean a superior IPA. This beer is big, chewy, and syrupy, but overall seems a bit too much of everything. Having recently sampled its West Coast sibling Stones Ruination, I was anticipating another blast of citrusy hops. But the 90 Minute IPA leans heavily on its British two-row malt backbone, rather than its hoppy exterior.  The beer poured a orangish/amber with a slight head fighting to rise above the body. A heavy and syrupy beer to balance the high octane IBUs that are supposedly the hallmark of this beer.  The aroma was sweet and malty with the Columbus hops very present but not not overwhelming.  The taste was rough, with the hops making only their subliminal presence known as they fought through the rather cloying malty sweetness. I detected a Granny Smith apple sweetness predominating, followed by the grapefruit citrus bite of the Chinook and Columbus hops. For a 90+ IBU beer, it was very sweet. The bitterness became much more apparent as the beer warmed.  The body was syrupy and thick on the tongue.  This IPA is the antithesis of a session beer. I enjoyed it, but was not as impressed as some reviewers have been.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Delirium,4.85,"Solid beer. Holy Hop! Typical red amber explodes with large bubbles in a sea of frothy foam which quickly dissipates in an explosion of hops.

10099,2093,Viking,3.93,"Murky harvest orange body, with a pretty nice, fat head. Pretty good retention, leaving lots of foam on the glass and a bit of lace atop the brew. Musty, earthy, woodsey hop aroma with plenty of citrus. Also a nice bit of malt backing. Hoppy flavor as well, with the piney Chinook most notable. Some malt flavor backs it up, but it seems just a bit unbalanced (damn, did I just type that?) , until the brew warms up a bit. Wonderfully bitter hoppy aftertaste, which again seems to be dominated by Chinook. Mouthfeel is slightly rough, full-bodied, with a Valdeez-like oily finish. Good brew and I'll try it again, but not something I'll seek out for my hop fix.  I originally tried this on draught and was extremely disappointed. Old keg? didn't work with beer or food I'd had previously in the evening? I don't know, but the further into that glass I got, the less I liked it.

Citrus and hops fill the nose as, the first sip is coming. The first sip brings a citrus and hop palate. I never thought I would be saying those two words in the same sentence. The combo is unreal.

10099,2093,jackndan,3.03,"90 Minute Imperial IPA from DogFish Head; Man, this was not at all what I was expecting. I had it in the big corked bottle, with loads of information about the beer on the label. 90 IBU! The moment the beer poured from the mouth of the bottle, I knew we had something very different here.  It poured relatively slowly, much like thin syrup than a beer. It took some rough handling to get the head started, but once it did it left some decent Belgium lace over the reddish brown beer. The aroma was strong, very heavily of hops.  The taste was initially not all that pleasant. It was clear that DFH used a ton of malts to soften the ton of hops they used, which leads to an extremely powerful beer, with a thick, syrupy mouthfeel. While this is a very hoppy beer, the hops were hard to distinguish. As this warmed, and I began to sip it more like a cognac and less like an IPA, I began to enjoy it much more. Not for the faint of heart, or anyone without a cast iron stomach.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Denali,4.5,"Appearance: Clear amber color, nice white head.  Smell: Hops, pine &#8211; not very strong, but the aroma may have been masked by the cigarette smoke in the bar. (I would like to smell the aroma of this beer without any other distracting odors).  Taste: Wow! Very strong hoppy and pine flavor when it first hits the mouth. But this beer also has some body to it. There is another taste that kicks in right after the hops taste but I do not know what it is. The best word I can use to describe it is &#8220;deep&#8221;, and this flavor remained as the aftertaste. Totally delicious! Some alcohol taste, but the other flavors hide the alcohol. The taste is so memorable that I can &#8220;relive&#8221; the taste just from memory (I can&#8217;t remember the last time something that I ate or drank left such a memory!). I savored every sip of this beer.  Mouthfeel: Very crisp, but not too much carbonation.  Drinkability: The alcohol in this beer hit me very quickly &#8211; more quickly than other beers I&#8217;ve had with the same or greater ABV (perhaps it&#8217;s the ingredients that cause the alcohol to be absorbed more quickly). If it wasn&#8217;t so strong, I would drink this all night &#8211; a tempting thought but I would probably have to be carried out of the bar.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Slightly cloudy honey gold in color with a white head that fades to a thin layer before the Dixie Chicks hit the last note leaving a nice lace. A citrusy hop aroma dominates, but not as strong as I was suspecting.  Kickoff!  The first sip is very sweet and hoppy, a smooth bitterness that seems almost impossible. The alcohol is also apparent, but not overpowering. It's a belly warmer for sure! Nice creamy mouthfeel with light carbonation. 90 IBUs and 9% ABV yet remarkably well balanced and drinkable. So drinkable that, on one hand, I wish I had another, but on the other, it's probably a good thing I don't.

10099,2093,49degrees,4.12,"""Feel the burn?... That's the sickness and the cure"" or so says the Dogfish Head brewery. This is a very enjoyable ""bitter"" IPA. It doesn't quite carry the punch that Stone's Ruination IPA does, but it does hit the palette pretty hard -- albeit in a good way.  Sold in large champagne styled brown bottles at 9%abv and features a wired down soft styled cork. On my bottle (freshness dated 12/02) the bent cork popped easily with little extra effort.  On the pour, it delivered a large rocky, bright white head which disapated slowly leaving little more that a thick, even spread surface foam with a nice solid collar. Lacing on the glass is extensive. Visually, the beer is exceptionally clear given the midrange amber hue that describes the beer.  A very robust, almost punchy aroma rife with with musty and earthly tones, a strong hoppy hit and plenty of delicious pine. There's even a slight roasted malt hint to help round it out. Some have called this an ""overwhelming experience,"" particularly in light of its high hop and alcohol counts, but in the end of the day, its extremely well rounded considering all the character it brings to the table.  Taste wise ... it really lives up to its billing. But its is pretty overwhelming for some. On the first hand experience, the palette is big and bold but not overly hoppy. But give is a couple of seconds and the aftertaste hits the palette and really takes over. For me, I'm a hop lover and bitter beers (that reads ""GOOD"" bitter beers) really hit the spot on my palette. However, I passed a glass around to several others when tasting this one during Superbowl XXXVII and none of the casual beer drinkers in the room could handle a glass of this on their own.  If you like big, bold, well rounded, but exceptionally hoppy beers -- complete with character and balance, then be sure to give the Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA a closer look. But if you're just mildly attracted to the bitter beer hit, proceed with caution.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Suds,4.14,"Came in a large, corked bottle.label art of a guy hammering his nose is disturbing and intriguing. Pale, hazy dark-straw colored beer with a coarse, rocky head. The head produces tiny tufts of lace, but really doesnt last very long. Exceedingly floral aroma. Maybe a little bit of sweetish malt smells as well, but its hard to distinguish anything through the hops. First taste is slightly sweet. Surprisingly smooth, soft mouthfeel. Theres a touch of alcohol warming, but not what I expected for the 9%. Also, the beer isnt as bitter as I was prepared for. Nicely balanced, and the finish pleasantly lingers. Overall, this is a drinkable, interesting beer. Its on the expensive side, and not a show-stoppingly great beer.but its certainly worth having again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Drinkability: I really liked this very nice IPA on-tap. I wonder if it is this good from a bottle?",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,MJR,4.54,"Appearance: Pours a wonderful looking reddish-amber color with copper edges. After trying four other Dogfish Head brews, I've finally found one that can actually hold a head for more than 15 seconds! It starts out fairly big, and shrinks to a steady, 3/8"" cap and laces really well.  Smell: Hops, hops, hop, and...oh...did I mention hops?! Awesome hop aroma here. It's very coarse and punguent... I can also detect a touch of sweet malt, but it's buried deep under the hop onslaught.  Taste: Whoa... This is probably the 'second' most bitter flavor I've ever encountered, after Stone Ruination IPA (sorry BA's, nothing touches that.) Pine, raw grapefruit, floral, this brew has all the typical American hop characteristics...in spades. There's a sturdy malt background which comes across as fairly sweet and smooth, but like in the smell, it gets trampled by the spicy hops. There is a strong alcohol flavor as well, which gets stronger towards the end, and almost completely takes over the aftertaste. The aftertaste also has the slightest burnt flavor, which I usually don't care for, but fits well here. Killer stuff...  Mouthfeel: Combines a medium thickness with a dry, crisp mouthfeel. Finishes very dry with a swipe of alcohol.  Drinkability: This is a tough one... I really like this one, and that's saying something considering what I think of Dogfish Head's other brews, but I can't see myself drinking more than one or two of these in one night. I'd get really goofy, really quick, and I'd have no tastebuds left.  Dogfish Head has created a monster here! One of my favorite IPA's...too bad they stopped using 750ml bottles, 'cause the 12oz ones aren't near as good.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,TXHops,4.97,"What an aroma! Yeah, it's hoppy, but so are tons of other beers. The difference is the specifics of the aroma. It smells EXACTLY like hops. Duh... Seriously though: lots of beers are hoppy and smell like there are a lot of hops in the beer, but 90 Minute smells EXACTLY like sniffing a bag of fresh hops at the homebrew store. First, the clear, unadulterated shot of American hops, then slowly and subtly the malt sneaks in, leaving the aromatic finish sweet and complex, magnified slightly by the subtle presence of alcohol. I love the fact that none of the 90 IBU's exhibit even the slightest harshness in my nose, unlike most assertively-hopped beers. This is really the major difference between this IPA and most other hyper-hop beers: no harshness. What an astounding first impression.  The beer pours an almost perfect, tea-orange: not brilliantly clear, but close (and it is bottle-conditioned). The head is just on the cream side of white and it laces well. I splurged and drank this from my Duvel glass, so there was the constant streamer of bubbles ready to populate the middle of the head with more foam, though the sides were a little more barren.  The taste is much the same as the aroma foreshadowsmassive, resiny, juicy hops, followed by mellow, smooth, sweet maltiness and then just a touch of warmth from the significant amount of alcohol. That focused, sticky-sweet hoppiness lingers forever, rendering even my occasional burp a cherished experience.  At the halfway point in the bottle, I found myself struggling between the elation associated with knowing that there was still about 375Ml of this amazing hop nectar still left for me to enjoy, and the crushing reality of the fact that after the bottle was empty, well, Ill think about that another time.  As the beer warmed and the inevitable end approached, the mouthfeel improved somewhat, showing a smoothness bordering on silky, but with more gravity than silk The fresh, intense hoppiness was renewed with each topping up of my glass, allowing for a new sense of ecstasy every 10 minutes or so. If only my burps would be so frequent.  Ive heard mixed reviews from other BAs regarding this particular beer, but for me, it was as close to perfect as Ive ever had from an IPA of any gravity. A stunning example of thinking inside the HUGE box that is traditional brewing. No fruit, no maple syrup, no champagne yeast, no spicesjust an AMAZING end result that captures the essence of the ingredients perfectly.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

Slightly hazy orange color, carbonation rises like a swarm of killer bees from all over the bottom and replenishes a monster head. Laces in sheets. Screamin orange extract aroma, carries a foot from the pint glass. Surprisingly, a boat load of caramel malts fire a salvo onto the tongue and thicken the mouthfeel. A heavy dose of hops only drags the rope back to its side (with a vengeance) closer to the finish, with a blast of juicy bitter bitter. Aroma balances malt earlier, quite an interesting take on balance. A beer at war with itself. I loved the novelty here, would definitely buy again (unless I had a cold sore in my mouth ;&gt;) ) Alcohol is a little obvious.

10099,2093,WVbeergeek,4.9,"Simply amazing!!! The people at Dogfish continue to amaze me here. This beer poured from the 25oz. bottle shines with an orangish amber, and a head that lasted for quite awhile. Taking my first few sips of this beer I must say filled up my senses. Instead of the instant rush of huge flavor of hops that I expected, it delivered a powerful plunge of hop flavor, but the flavor somewhat mellowed out in my mouth like a crashing wave. Sending ripples of maltiness and hops that were completely perfect together, this beer delivered everything expected from a big IPA and then some. I feel that this beer completed what many set out to do. Exceptional, I definitely loved this one.  Update 12oz bottle,  Appears a copper amber hue with a creamy off white head and nice residual lacing even dispersed around my pint. Zum wohl now there are some hops like a walk in the forest this beer fills up my senses. Hops of pine cone origin and a nutty trail mix-esque tone very full and malty just a heavenly combination for some not ready for the amount of hops this beer contains then it may be easier to just smell instead of consume. I orginally compared this flavor to a crashing wave allow me to just say this is a kick in the teeth full of flavor, it's is truly amazing how so many hops were put into this brew to retain a balanced flavor. Burping up hops this is great with syrupy sweetness mixed with a hazelnut caramelly edge to it and the hop resins in full cohesion to form a heavenly experience a must try for all beer lovers this is a staple in the realm of Imperial IPAs. Mouthfeel is full and syrupy but wow how drinkable is this stuff at 9% watch out because this beer is too drinkable at any occasion or function what a beer.

The hop taste is balanced with an assertive yet low key maltiness that seems to support the hops rather than battle with them. 90 IBU's and 9% ABV and you will be warm and hoppy all night long. Dogfish Head is known for pushing the envelope and this ale does just that. This is an ale that is meant to be and is BITTER. What a wonderful thing.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,DrewS,4.25,"Year 2002. Comes in a corked 750 ml bottle. Pours a hazy golden orange with a nice fluffy head that sticks around for a while and left nice lace down the glass. Hops dominate the nose with floral, citrus, and grassy, earth aromas. This beer has a strong hop flavor with a substantial body and slick, smooth mouthfeel. Hop flavors are all over the place though the earthy flavors stand out the most to me. Floral and citrus flavors echo the aroma. Malt taste is faint and yells in the background, ""Here I am!"" but the hops keep it restrained as they demand full attention. The alcohol chimes in with a whisper shortly after. The long, bitter finish grips the tongue and doesn't seem to want to let go. This is really a hopheads delight. Treat like a Belgian quantity wise as the alcohol content can easy send your head swimming. I recommend this beer to people with a taste for hops.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,yen157,4.47,"It poured from the bottle clear and orange with a rocky, sticky head. Nice floral, fruity cascade aroma pineapple. I couldn't really get to the malt through the big hoppy smell. As expected, the first sip was quite bitter, though is was not nearly as intense as anticipated. It was hard to distinguish flavors ar first because of the bitterness. After my mouth because accustomed to it, other flavors emerged. There was a nice yeasty malt whose major flavor contribution was bread crust. As the beer warmed the malt and a fruitiness became more apparent as did a touch of diacetyl. With my mouth stuck tasting bitter the beer seemed more balanced than it really was.  Definately a great beer. I do not consider myself a ""hophead"", but the excess of hops made this beer fun and complex in that more work than usual had to be done to determine flavor charactistics.  2/20 Update: I paired this with a Greek salad with a cardamom vinnaigrette and it was great. The hops were tamed by the brine of the kalamatas, the vinegar, the spiciness of the ground cardamom and black pepper, and the feta.The malt of the brew was really accentuated.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Gusler,4.42,"The beer pours an obscure yellow-orange color with the head magnificent in size and creamy in texture, the color a light tan and as it dissipates, the lace forms a thick and sticky sheet to cling mightily to the glass. Nose is hop floral, spicy, and citrus like with just a hint of yeast, start is malt sweet and the top has a full feel to the palate. Finish moderately carbonated and devastatingly hopped with the aftertaste dry, with a bazillion tiny bottles, creeping up the glass with the second pour, interesting beer, I feel quite complex, a quite quaffable beer its a must try for the ""Hopheads"" in the audience.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,dolem98,4.51,"Highlights: -Beautiful golden/amber color -Excellent hop nose. Perfectly floral. -Bitterness is evident but not overpowering at all. The aftertaste is sublime- relish in the hops.  Additional Notes: -Not quite as bitter as I expected. This beer is more hopped for the aroma and flavor than the bitterness aparrently. It might even seem closer to a hopped up barleywine than an IPA for me, but perhaps this is the definition of an Imperial IPA. -Head dissipated and left no lace, hence the 3.5 on appearance. I think appearance is more of a bonus factor when reviewing beers, this one just didn't grab that bonus, other than the beautiful color, it was not spectacular.  The bottom line: A must try for those who love that the sweet nectar of flowery hops.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Wildman,4.15,"This beer poured a dark gold color and formed a nice foamy off white head that held and left some nice circular lace as it slowly subsided. A good deal of carbonation is present. An aroma of hops and a touch of citrus. A flavor of hops with some sweetness present. Also some of the alcohol is present. A touch astrigent in the finish with some bitterness. The sweetness of this one is offset by the presence of the alcohol. While not one of the hoppier IPAs, it is good and doesn't get offset to much with the sweetness. A good IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,frank4sail,3.93,"Tasted 10-8-02 Monks Dogfish Head Beer/Spirits Dinner.  Frothy white head. Hazy orange color. Murky orange smooth look. Sweet, lemon/orange peel, hop nose. Smooth hop taste with a touch of bitter orange. Stainless cask which is dry hopped with a big bag of hops for one month. Lots of yeast sediment left in the glass. Great mouth. Good but not as solid and rounded as the 60 min.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,IrishRedRock,4.02,"Wow, this was complex...there is a whole lot going on with this brew in every way. I couldnt pinpoint the smell, very hoppy with a tinge of rubbing alcohol. Poured a nice lighter brown color from the champagne magnum.  My first few sips were ""wow, this is awesome."" Went down so smoothly, felt like a thin syrup on my tongue with a great strong hop flavor.  Updated 6/22/03, 12 oz bottle. Same as above, alcohol and kickass hop flavor not as powerful as from the 22oz bottle. Floral oily hops and fresh fruit still dominate the nose. Smooth, more refined than before, and did not seem to have as much of an alcohol presence. Better than my previous sample. Not my favorite IPA by any means, but definitely one to be reckoned with.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,ElGuapo,4.3,"i will admit this was bought because of the dude hammering a nail into his nose on the bottle, but when i get it again it will certainly not be for that reason. this is a kick ass ipa. definitely my favorite. a slight malt keeps the hops in balance. a little yeasty and spicy, this ipa is extremely crisp yet smooth. if you like ipa's or hate them get this beer",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,aracauna,3.62,"True amber color, catches the light and seems to glow. Nice foamy off-white head builds easily and has good renention. Actually never got below a centimeter in thickness.. Surprising lack of hop aroma for such a high IBU. Seems to be lacking in hop flavor as well. Have I really gotten this used to hop bitterness or has this bottle been aged long enough that the hops aren't as much a part of the mix anymore? I'll find out tomorrow when I revisit the Arrogant Bastard. Has a flavor (from the yeast perhaps?) that I picked up in World Wide Stout and Raison D'etre. It's similar (vaguely) to some of the flavors I associate with Belgian yeast. As it warmed, I picked up more hops, mostly pine-like but some citric qualities, but never as much as I would expect from a beer that advertised its IBU.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,sinistersteve,4.85,"Well, what can I say about this beer. The label has a guy hammering a nail up his nose, I read that the hop process was used with one of those old-school electric football games (which would be the second best use for them since I saw one smashed over the head of an individual in a pro-wrestling match), and there is a damn cork in the bottle. Something ain't right here and I'm bound to find out what it was. Turns out, there is not much wrong with it at all. After having a minor grappling match with the cork, my efforts were soon rewarded with an exceptionally thick head on the pour. A almost ruby color in my glass and a burst of hopiness in the taste making this a great beer. I first had this at the IBF in Portland and now I remember why I kept going back for second and third helpings. A must have for any beer geek. This one is definately on the list to repurchase over and over.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,inebrius,4.37,"Hazy orange under a fat and fluffy head. Nose is hops and hops with a little bit of hops. Huge malt spine is cut with hops, bitter and flavor and aroma hops over fruity esters around a smooth and alcoholic warmth. This is a dangerously tasty brew and the best Dogfish Head beer I've had.  Cheers to frank4sail for the gift! You all right bro!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,NeroFiddled,4.22,"A bottle-conditioned IPA utilizing a single, constant 90 minute hop addition of Cascade, Columbus and Chinook. They originally did this by hooking and old ""electric football"" game above the kettle and adding hops to the top of it. As it vibrated, the hops were slowly shaken off the edge. Unfortunately, (since it makes such a great story and everyone has fond memories of electric football) it got sprayed with water and never ran again! Now they've got a slow moving auger. The 90 minute is available in bottle (and draft at the brewpub), but the 60 minute is draft only (update - 12 oz. bottles were added in March 2003!). It has an impressive hop aroma but I kind of expected more. The malt is very basic in flavor (not very caramelish), but rich with a good body. Thankfully, it's enough to handle the intense hop flavors. There's alot of yeast character including an apricot fruitiness. The alcohol is a bit on the high side but it may smooth out if aged. The bitterness is there. Really there. As one local beer writer said, ""Feel the burn"". Definitely on the edge!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,ZAP,3.71,"Almost a bit of a sweet perfumy aroma....also sweet fruit like apples and pears on the nose...very crisp looking royal gold with a one-inch creamy head...very sweet in the mouth...Not very IPAish although there is some late bitterness emerging on the long finish...sticky sweet mouthfeel.,..From the label it sounds like the worked their asses off trying to balance the malt load but it comes up a little short...a bit too sweet...still well above average and well worth trying...the long finish definitely has some bitterness to it...",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,BillyBrew,3.55,"This beer is a freakish novelty. This brew has a hazy-copper colour with a strong, thick creamy head that sticks it out. Striking hop oil, just brutally wrenched out of that poor hop. Astrigent highs mix with a punchy alcohol on the nose. The hop taste is densely complex, indecipherable even. A odd chewy density of hop. As hop heavy as this brew is, there is some malt that grounds it a bit to prevent a skyrocketing imbalance. A thick, dese medium body with a dryness and a hop-oily after taste!?  I am appreciating the effort, but not neccesarily enjoying it. More of an effort of love than of ease. Definately try it out if you a down with the hopness, but two may be too many. Cheers",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Jon,4.32,"2003 bottling, aged five months.  Slightly hazed peach color with a rocky white head that retains very well, leaving behind mazes of lace. Small traces of active carbonation are evident.  Perfumy hops, overripe grapefruit, faint smokiness, caramel malt, trace alcohol and additional high alpha hop oils presist aromatically.  Taste is far more balanced than fresh samples, though the initial, harsh hop bitterness is restrained. This results in a rounder, maltier 90 Minute with emphasis on ripe citrus fruit, caramel malt, residual malt sugars, a hint of smoke, and a lingering, yet restrained (for 90 Minute) hop bitterness. Fresh bottles reveal less balance and more hops, yet aging this bottle has led to a fuller, more balanced maltiness. Ample hop character still exists to fulfill any lupulinic yearning, which is the beauty of this particular bottle.  Smooth mouthfeel, lightly carbonated and slightly oily.  Drinks better than the fresh stuff -- smoother, more balanced and less of an alcoholic impact. A fun experiment with successful results. I'll soon see how the 2002 bottling has come along.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Bighuge,4.12,"This beer is predominantly copper, but also seems to glow a beautiful orange hue. Big frothy white head. Bigtime pungency on the aroma. Plus nice little subtle citrus and pine nuances. Nice tasting IPA. Citrus and grapefruit rine present. Nice little bitterness. Some malt load here too. Very good IPA. Not and elite one in my book however.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Jdiddy,3.53,"Well the stories you hear about the cork are true. We had twoguys trying to get the damn thing out. After about 10 minutes, we succeeded. Be very careful pouring this, it foamed up like crazy and I puored it pretty slow. The taste was not as hoppy as I expected. The alcohol taste was definitely there. I would recommend it just slightly chilled. As it became more warm, it was just too much. It think I will but a bottle and age it. Seems a bit too early to drink it now.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Bierman9,4.28,"Damn, after struggling with the cork, I was thinking ""This better be worth it!"" Never did get all the cork; half broke off the top, the rest fell in the bottle! Has a nice dark, copper color, but very small head. The color has some slight cloudiness, with the yeast swirled in. Not many IPA's have the yeast in, eh? A real good bit o' lace sticks around! Nose is hops, and then more hops! Whiffs of the 9% abv show through, too! Good body, and nicely smooth over my tongue. There's a lot of strong, floral hoppiness in the flavor, mixed in with malty sweetness.A spicy bite is present at the finish. A different hop profile, but quite enjoyable!! Was the cork struggle worth it?

10099,2093,beerluvr,4.7,"Be forewarned-If you are not a fan of big/hoppy beers, stay away from this monster of a beer! Pours an insanely rocky and long-lasting foam collar over well carbonated orange-hued liquid ambrosia. Pungent citrus/piney hops assault the nasal passages. Taste is at first bitter as all hell, some estery fruitiness peeks thru midway, followed by hops and alcohol to lead the way to a tremendous hop finish. This is an IPA on steroids, highly drinkable even with it's in-your-face qualities. Slam a 750ml. bottle of this quick enough & you'll want to try re-enacting the picture on the label! A great accompaniment to some King Crimson music on headphones.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,beernut7,2.63,"This dark red/gold brew presents with a thick lasting head and exudes the strong scent of hops and alcohol. Taste is reminiscent of a strong ale but with a bucket load of bittering hops. This is a harshly sweet and very bitter ale. Not very drinkable and not to be consumed in large quantities. I have had one other ""imperial IPA"" and 90 minute does not compare to it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Andy,4.92,"Sampled in 2001, this may have been my beer of the year. After having had some excellent experiences with Victory's Hop Devil and its ability to balance massive amounts of malt and hops, I was blown away by the 90 Minute IPA. A huge, masterful mix of alcohol, malt and hops, this beer almost completely satisfies me as a drinker. Great hop bitterness and flavor throughout, and of course, incredibly well-balanced. The sign of a true master brewer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Brent,4.6,"Wonderfully brutal. 90 IBU's - a hops extravaganza. Solid malt to carry the weight of all those hops. The 9% abv shows up in a spicy finish. My sample was the 1 pint 9.6 oz. bottle. Lets just say I'm glad I had this at home. For the hops wallop this beer packs, it is surprisingly drinkable. The bottle's designation of this as an ""Imperial India Pale Ale"" is deserved.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95

10099,2093,jermar,4.08,"Pours with a thick, big head. Orange-amber colored with rich well-balanced taste combining strong hop flavors, alcohol burn, and thick maltiness. Leaves a pleasant oily bitter aftertaste with slight syrupy malt sweetness. I really like this one despite the relatively high alcohol content because the alcohol tastes are integrated with the hop and malt flavors, especially as the beer warms. Comparable to Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale but with more alcohol in the mix.  I think they named it 90 Minute IPA because that's how long it takes to get the cork out of the bottle!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,marcobrau,4.12,"Not quite the monster hop bitterness I anticipated. Although the brewers at Dogfish Head succeeded in making this beer hoppy and spicy, they did not make that bitter. I've homebrewed beers with more bitterness than this, but I have to credit to the brewers for producing such a highly hopped product. I think this beer could be a little stronger, closer to the strength of a barleywine, which would make it a good choice for laying down in a cellar. Still a pretty outrageous brew!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,cokes,2.63,"Just tried this in 12oz form. Not sure if it comes across differently in this format, but my experience certainly was. Taste was over-ridden with peach schnapps and poorly mixed gin and tonics. Big sweet and quinine alcohol flavors atop a pleasant but destroyed toasted English muffin maltiness. Loads of buttery, and butterscotch diacetyl as well. Paint thinner esters. Heavy and cloying and alcohol-bitter to the point of undrinkability. Ended up dumping this one. Tried it again the next day and did the same. I am gonna try giving this some time, and I hope for results that mirror my impressions of the 750 (as stated below). --- Hops are certainly there in abundance...but, strangely, not as heavily as I expected (per the other reviews). Grassy and tight, with ganja backings, the hops are evident, but not explosive. The malt provides a solid foundation for the hops and the heavy alcohol presence. It's extremely well balanced for a brew of this strength...if perhaps a bit over-sweet. But in the end....it was just a strong IPA...Dogfish couldn't even work magic with this one. Don't get me wrong, it is quite a nice beer (and I am not ripping on IPA's), but this one does not differ that much from alot of others....and difference is something Dogfish seems to pride themselves on, so it seems all the more ""normal"".  It ends up being a good, strong IPA, but nothing to shout about. (rating 3.9)",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,Murph,4.12,"I have to agree with the other reviewers. This was not insanely hopped like I thought it would be. It was very hoppy but had some nice malt balance to it. Gets a bit of an alcohol taste as the beer starts to warm. Overall a good beer. Beautiful appearance. Perfect copper, slightly hazy with a nice sticky head. I am going to lay some of these down. I can't wait to see what they are like in a year or two.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
10099,2093,John,4.2,"Had this one on tap. And balanced it is. Very smooth and drinkable for a brew of 9.0% abv. though I would have enjoyed a more assertive hop profile. Maybe the keg version is a bit more mellow than the bottled. Nevertheless, a very good brew.

10099,2093,mophie,4.53,"I expected to be blasted with hops, but this beer was surprisingly balanced. Don't get me wrong, the hops are insane, but they were balanced quite nicely by a fruity, almost apricot taste.

10099,2093,marc77,4.1,"Had to try it. The first sip is nothing but hops. After the palette adjusts and the beer warms, tasty malt, fruity esters and a touch of diacetyl become part of the flavor profile. They must've used a British yeast. The hop character is definitely American, but those esters make for a bastard of an IPA. Lots of alcoholic warmth in the finish. A tad hazy with a thick creamy head. This is a complex beer that must be sipped or your ass will be kicked. I'm drinking this by myself since everyone else here loves wine. I guess my ass will be kicked. I'll place this a notch below Stone's 5th Anniversary IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,95
