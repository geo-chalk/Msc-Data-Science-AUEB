L: Clear amber, a lot of fast rising bubbles, one finger off-white head, foam is rocky and moderately persistent, vertical streaks of lace. A: Nose is weak at first, slightly mineral, herbal hops, a little more robust and malty as it warms, fruited bread-like malt aroma. T: Opens malty, light bread and caramel malt, herbal tea-like, finishes with mildly bitter notes of woody hops and lemon zest. F: Light-medium body, medium carbonation, soft and a bit creamy, tiny bit of chewiness.

28,63,Mr_Brown,4.1,"FtB. Amber/caramel colour, clean. Foam drops quickly. Smell of caramelized barley, sweet, like vienna lager. Taste starts dry like brown bread crust, then goes into caramel, lolipops, almost cola sweetness. Finishes dry again. Great balance and feel. , Lacks spiciness/bitterness/sourncess to me, a bit too sweet. Feels like a great vienna lager.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,DumbRunner26,3.95,"Gorgeous amber color with a sticky white head. Smells like green tea and fresh baked bread. Surprise with the flavor. Much more than a novelty, this is a good beer. Bread, honey, with a hint of spice. Clean crisp mouthfeel. Very sessionable beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,lagrluvr,4.23,"Pours a rich amber with a thick, tall beige /tan head that lasts and leaves lacing bands down the stange glass. Aromas are faint but quality barley malts and hop notes do come through. The taste is great! Barley malt up front, caramel malt perhaps. Nce and rich but crisp and a slight fruit note. Very good as always! Had to revisit since ESB is a hard style to find, and Simon in Wales compared it to a best bitter. Very nice! Nice body, feel and finish. An American Classic! Must have one if you like straight up good beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,DrOfGolf,3.98,"Poured from a bottle and is golden in color with a small white head that didn't last very long. The smell is of malt, caramel and possibly honey. The flavor is surprisingly good.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,tucson_brewson,4.12,"12 oz bottle poured into pint glass  L - Pours a clear, copper amber color with a good finger of creamy head that leaves a generous lacing  S - Bready malt-forward aroma, caramel, dark fruit, banana, slightly earthy and spicy, a hint of hops  T - Follows the nose with caramel malty sweetness, toasty biscuit, dark fruit, a little bit of an astringent hoppy bite toward the end, fairly balanced.  F - Light-to-medium bodied, moderately above average carbonation, finishes slightly creamy but drinkable  O - My first “steam” beer that reminds me of an amber. Fairly balanced and very drinkable, it seems like it should be in the 5.5-6% ABV with the complex notes but at 4.9% this is a sessionable beer I enjoy.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Reef,3.76,"On tap. Clear copper. Two fingers variegated cream head. Full cap and lacing. Malty bready, light fig, stone fruit aromas. Wheat bread, light nut, floral flavors. Light body, good lasting carbonation, bitter aftertaste. Tasty and a nice change from hop forward diet.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,kotocar,2.33,Its a really carbonated and standard malty beer. I get a festive-Christmas like after taste from this beer which reminds me of nutmeg or cinnamon. I don't like that part. Earthy and nutty is how I would describe it. However more earthy. It's not a bad beer by any margin just not something that I enjoy. I leave beers for my own record so based for my tastes it's a 2.5 type of beer.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,4DAloveofSTOUT,4.25,"12oz bottle poured into narrow gauge pint glass.  Appearance: Copper colored body. Big & dense bone white head.  Smell: Malt forward aroma. Light caramel, toasty, slightly nutty. Earthy hops perhaps? They are light and its hard for the nose to pull out the aroma.  Taste: Toasty, grainy, and lightly nutty malt profile. A bready element in there as well. Complex and smooth malt sweetness. Light bitterness in the finish. Gentle earth and floral notes.  Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer. moderate carbonation level. Creamy textured body.  Overall: My first time drinking a California common / steam beer. This beer was an obvious choice because it is readily available with a wide distro footprint and it's one of those old school beer's that has a certain nostalgia about it. This is a really excellant beer. I can see why it's iconic beer for sure. I would drink a bunch of these on a hot day at an outdoor potluck or BBQ.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,md3kcn,4.33,"Purchased as a six-pack of bottles from Ingles for $10.99. Poured into a nonic pint glass.  L - Clear orange-amber, with a one-finger slightly cream head that goes away rather quickly. Not too much lacing. S - Floral and earthy. Caramel. A bit of resin, too. T - Wonderfully complex! Starts off nice and bready (think pumpernickel and brown bread), and leans into a hoppy wave of earth and floral notes. Ends on a bread crust note, and a lowly toffee air. A slight white grape note is present throughout. Well-balanced, for sure! F - Medium-bodied, with plenty of carbonation. Refreshing. Super drinkable. O - My first steam beer, and I've got to tell you - it's the perfect fishing beer. Well-balanced and complex, while not being super overwhelming. Refreshing and crazy easy-to-drink. Tons of flavor. Highly recommend!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,JZH1000,4.04,"Poured from a 12oz can.  The look is a nice solid amber, crystal clear with lively carbonation and a one finger head. Dissipates over a minute to a thin covering. No lacing  Aroma is giving me strong malty lager vibes here. Very lager aroma maybe some hops here, but they are definitely a small amount of bittering only hops. Maybe a bit of off aroma, slight skunk even with the can, but it could be an older can.  Taste leaves the off flavor right in the dust this is delicious. Right up front is amber lager similar to the aroma but it quickly goes into a weird ester-y altbier sort of thing and it's very interesting theres quite an evolution on this one despite seeming pretty basic when I got into it. Some hop bitterness on the very back end. Dont know what to really compare it to. But it's quite malty.  Feel is nice and creamy big body in the mouth bit still very easy to put down. Its al.ost like a milkshake in texture but liquid and carbonated if you can catch my drift l. Probably not but it's good. All year.  Overall a very interesting beer. I'm glad I got it. Not really comparable to any other style, but so easy to drink malty decadent lager ale wonderland, despite the cover (which your not supposed to judge by) only looking average at best.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,GABronco,4.23,"I ordered a Fat Tire, but the bar was out and the bartender recommended Anchor Steam as a good alternative. I'm glad he did.  Look - dark amber, nice head that lasted.  Smell - malty with hints of sweetness  Taste - really good. The malt shines with just the right amount of hops in the background  Feel - Above average with moderate carbonation  Overall, I really enjoyed this and will order it again if I see it on a menu. I've never seen it in stores around me (southeast).",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,JohnniEMc,3.99,"Two twelve ounce cans emptied into a clear glass liter mug reveal a pretty colored beer. It's brightly copper-amber and rather translucent. The slightly off-white head is much larger than what should have been expected for a reasonably gentle pour of a chilled brew. Obviously, it's well carbonated. It smells fuller than most American adjunct lagers. The malt is easy to find and is quite pleasant. There's a note of hops, too, but they're playing second fiddle. The taste is also much more malty than hoppy, although it's not hoppiless. Overall, it has an earthy and slightly nutty flavor, with a hop bittering at the finish. Although pleasant, that's the only complexity of the taste. Ìt drinks more like a Kolsch than a lager. The mouthfeel is disappointing. With all that foamy head, it drinks surprisingly flat. It's like most of the carbon dioxide went into the head, leaving little left for the beer. The history of this beer is renowned, even by casual drinkers. But, the craft beer phenomenon has made this more of a tradition than a treat.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,BubbleBobble,3.54,"Pours a slightly hazy orange amber from the can, light, creamy 1"" head with moderate retention but great lacing. Nose is sweet and bready with sticky malt, toffee, and light yeast notes; barley tea as it develops deeper on the palate. Taste has a very light malty sweetness balanced with enough bitter hop to indicate it is there. Mouthfeel is smooth with gentle carb. Overall, cooling and refreshing.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Moderate to mild bitterness.  Mouth feel; Full bodied. Medium length, clean finish.  Overall: The first craft beer I ever drank. Can't believe it took me this long to right a review & notes. It's full bodied. Presents herbal & spicy hops aroma and flavors on a mostly sweet malt backbone. There is hint of mint. Moderate bitterness. Nice, easy drinker. More flavorful than typical American golden pilsners/lagers. Nice looking beer in the glass. Always a joy to revisit.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,AudioFileZ,3.68,This is one of my all-time favorites. Not for any one thing but for the sum total that it is. It's not too heavy to drink a four or so and it's heavy enough to know you are not drinking watered down corn fermented corn juice which I detest. The hop amount is nigh on perfect for the masses yet enough for the aficionado who discerns the kind and type. They never need to change this one as it is the perfect high-quality everyman's brew. I say that but it does command a more premium price than a everyman's brew and in most areas is only available in sixers (i.e. no 12-packs and no cases which is a huge mistake). I have only one more thing to say and that is I would drink this happily if there were no other brews and that is in spite of the new yellow and blue labeling which sucks as the previous label was the absolute best in the who brewing business.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,LesDewitt4beer,4.17,"12oz bottle=8oz tasting glass. I've enjoyed this beer since 1986. L: Pours clear med amber w a thin off-white creamy head that goes to skin, lite fine carbo, very lite skeletal lacing. S: Light caramelized malts, lightly floral. Very simple. T: Citrus zest, earthy, a sensation of black tea, resinous, yeast, brown bread, toasty malts, bitter aftertaste, hops go wide. F: Crisp, zesty & bright med-lite bodied mouthfeel w a gently rich center and a dry lingering finish. O: A zesty, malty, & toasty beer that screams California which has spawned many beers and breweries. A beautiful beer to behold with exceptional balance and excellent taste with a great easy drinking feel. It is excellent in it's style.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,DrBeergood,4,"L: Pours amber. Mild carbonation and nucleation. Remarkably clear.  S: Roasty toasty barley. Bready sweetness, and a touch of hops.  T: Tangy and zangy, caramelized grain.  F: Thick and bready flavor but it's rather lightweight.  O: I would relate this to Shiner Bock or Okocim. It's rather nice.

28,63,StephenLovett,4.38,"Generally an underrated beer. Pours a crystal clear copper color with an off white head, the slight head from 12 oz bottle dissipating in a few minutes. A clean malty nose with a mild more English ale hop note. This beer has a wonderful malt and hop balance, Lightly carbonated, an enjoyable clean malty taste with a crisp bitterness, think northern brewer / Kent goldings, unique in style, with a total absence of the typical Cascade piney notes. Totally unique and the canonical steam beer, the mix of pale and caramel malts provide a very slight sweetness that is perfectly balanced with the level of bitterness. Very drinkable, a really lovely beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,HarlotBronte,4.3,"L: Pours a clear copper with a 2 finger off white foamy head. A beautiful looking beer. S: Malt T: Caramel malt upfront, light bitterness on the finish F: Crisp, medium bodied, drying finish O: This is the only California Common/ Steam Beer I’ve tried so I can’t compare it to anything. As a beer in general, it’s very good. It has the flavor of a beer in the 5.5-6% range. I will be buying again and again!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,SoCalNative,4.27,"The Steam Beer is my second favorite next to Anchor's California Lager.  Pours a nice golden amber/brown. Almost as dark as the bottle. Not too much of a head, may be the velvet-like smoothness of my pouring technique (*fingerguns*).  Anyways...  Kind of an even malt/fruity hop aroma. Not much visible carbonation at all.  Taste is un-f***ing-paralleled.  This is truly a work of art, just like their Cali Lager.  It's not bitter. It's not sweet.  It's just refreshing.  If you get a chance to try this beer, understand that it's of West Coast origin. You'll probably like this brew!  I love this brew and would recommend this AND the California Lager. (Real similar, but still apples and oranges when comparing them both.)",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Scotchboy,3.75,"Fantastic summer beer here, had on-tap and enjoyed thoroughly; can't believe I've never reviewed this one before. Wonderful malty, mildly nutty and somewhat caramelly lead-in with a light, snappy grassy and earthy hop component that all blend beautifully into a clean and crisp body and finish that doesn't carry a trace of lager-y skunk. Recommended.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,milkshakebeersucks,4.13,"I find it difficult to write a normal review about appearance, aroma, etc, when it is about such a classic such as Anchor Steam. In how many reviews are words like amber or malty repeated that they become numb to the reader? Does it taste as good today as it did 40 years ago? Hell, I don't know, Perceptions can change from day-to-day let alone decade-to-decade. But it's still enjoyable.  Just let me say it is still unique, still a legacy, still delicious and I still respect it immensely after so many years of imbibing.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Bierwolf,3.72,"Appearance: Nice amber color, with ½ to 1 finger off white frothy foam. Reduces to basically nothing in a few minutes. Clear. Very nice carbonation. Aroma: Get a nice nose of malt and some yeast. Bites at your nose a little bit. Taste: Piney hops and a little grassy flavor. Mouth Feel: I was getting a light medium feel for this. Very nice carbonation. Over All: This was a nice refreshing beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Balashi963,4.49,"I had my first Anchor Steam in 1986, in San Francisco, when that was the only place you could get it. Probably my favorite beer. Exceptional when on tap. Sipping on one tonight, out of a can in a tulip glass, I got from Doyle's Pub. Deep Amber Color, great taste.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Wattie83,3.97,"Had on tap in 16 oz shaker pint. Looks bronze colored with a white head that fell to a cap. Clear beer with carbonation rising throughout. Smell is a bit subdued with strong malt presence and a generic fruitiness from the hops or maybe the yeast? Taste is sweet and malty up front with a fruit/earthiness in the middle. Sweetness subsides and you get a little bitterness to even things out. Finish is clean with little aftertaste. Feel is crisp, medium bodied, solid carbonation. Overall, it's been a long time since I've had this beer. I don't remember liking it as much as I did this time around. It was easy drinking, refreshing, and really flavorful. I will try bottled/canned versions, but I doubt they'll live up to the draft version.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,BerkeleyBeerSleuth,4.13,"Copper color with a creamy off white head. The first whiff I get is of malts, like nice roasted nutty malts with bits of brown sugar. A slight hint of fruity esters from the hops. Taste is on the malty side with just a slight fruity hoppiness. The mouthfeel is great for the style, not think or thick; just right. This is sort of somewhere between a proper lager and a light pale ale. A really unique style and a beer I would suggest to someone just beginning to get into craft beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,Neco62622,3.43,"For the past couple of decades Anchor Steam has been my favorite beer. The last couple of months, I have been only able to purchase in cans and have developed some question as to the quality. It tastes a bit bland and I have been buying my go to alternative which is a local Pale Ale that provides the kind of malt forward taste and crispness I appreciate so much in Anchor Steam. I just purchased two six packs of Anchor Steam bottles in the new bright yellow and blue logo, but it seems the bland taste is not because of the cans. Has anyone else noticed a change in quality and taste in their Anchor Steam?",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,DefenCorps,3.83,"Can from Whole Foods  A clear deep amber with a dense, off-white head with excellent retention and lacing, this looks solid. The nose is solid. Clean, fresh hops, rather English in character with a spicy, earthy, mildly nutty note along with a toffee, caramel and light butterscotch note. An awesome, delicate fruity character is present. The palate opens bitter and earthy, with a dusty, fruity, mildly sweet flavor combination. Earthy hops, mildly leafy and floral, along with a dry, brown sugar, toffee and butterscotch malt flavor. Fruity yeast on the mid-palate, pairing nicely with the caramel and especially the hops. Drying, creamy, lush on the finish despite the high carbonation. Medium-light in body, the mouthfeel is excellent. This is really good stuff.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,IPAs_for_days_13,3.36,"L: Pours a beautiful clear copper color with a bitchin beige head. S: Smells rich of sweet-grain malts, caramel, straw, subtle amount of earthy hops. T: Taste very much follows the nose, its surprisingly more hop forward than malts, the hops gives it a bitter finish. F: Medium-bodied, medium carbonation, bitter finish, crisp. O: It's not a bad beer by any means, I was just expecting something more malt forward rather than bitter. Anchor porter is still the way to go.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,UristMcBrewer,3.52,"The beer is a rather pleasant amber color with a beige head. The head isn't spectacular but it is there. I'm a big fan of the color. The smell really stands out with fruity esters and spiciness. There are notes of coconut, banana bread, and cloves. The taste is more malt forward at first with the fruit esters taking over towards the end. The malt is bread like and shortcake like. The aftertaste is apple centric with coconut and banana bread from earlier dialed down. The feel is surprisingly thick. The water used is harder than most beers and the carbonation is on point. The feel is well balanced. Overall, it is a good beer. It smells great and has a good mouthfeel.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Solid beer and will always be a personal favorite.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,flgimp,4.06,"I am not familiar with this style but I like this one. A pretty pour, nice amber color, frosty head and light lacing.

Pours a deep clear amber with a medium sized head. Smell is rich and grainy, honey and bready yeast.  Taste is also rich and grainy with a lot of honey and bready yeast. But, there's also a bit of a bitter bite -- not too much, so maybe more like a nibble, just enough to let you there are teeth here.  Mouthfeel is surprisingly full, though also surprisingly low on carbonation. Overall, this is a much richer and more interesting beer than it was in my memory. I'm glad I decided to revisit it.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,ABrewOrTwo,4.8,"Just one of my favorite beers of all time. Every time I taste it I remember why. Very malty, moderately sweet but with a decent hop kick to balance it out. Medium-light carbonation and medium-heavy mouthfeel. Somehow perfect for every season and occasion: delicious with food, tasty on its own -- refreshing in the summer, pleasant in the winter -- but best of all on a slightly chilly, foggy, fall or spring day, preferably somewhere near the sea. That brings out the spirit of its San Francisco origin.

The nose detects some roasted grain and malt and not much else.  Taste starts with a light bitterness down the middle and some malt sweetness to the sides, The malty flavor has notes of toasted grain and the hop tang is light pine to me. The light bitterness is persistent and a bit surprising.  Mouthfeel is medium with a creamy slickness through the finish. The bitterness does not cause the finish to be astringent just a bit thick or cloying.  I was anticipating a pleasant amber ale type beer. I got some of that but with more bitterness and less fuller roasted malt sweetness.

28,63,TheBricenator,4.35,"Look: Clear amber-red and my sloppy pour leads to a huge off-white head that quickly settles, leaving good lacing behind Aroma: Bready malts, earthy notes, hints of toffee, slight floral notes, and some fruity esters present as well Taste: Bread, earthiness and floral notes up front while toffee and fruity esters come and go in the mix. Clean, lager-like maltiness comes into play in the middle before the earthy notes and fruitiness close things out Mouthfeel: Clean and crisp throughout, medium-high carbonation, and a very crisp and clean finish with zero accompanying dryness Overall: Tasty stuff here. A solid classic and a beer that introduced me to the California Common/Steam Beer style years ago. Great flavors and aromas, killer balance, and a true hybrid as this beer continually shows aspects of both ales (fruity esters) and lagers (clean & crisp) on each and every sip. An awesome classic and recommended",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Rug,3.84,"Bottled 1/3/20  Another day, another style I haven't tried yet. I've heard this one talked about for a long time as a classic, let's see if it lives up to the hype  Pours a mostly clear orange with 3 fingers of soapy beige head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing  The nose here is sweet but balanced. I get lots of honey, lager yeast, mild lemon, doughy malts, and grassy hops  Starting off the flavor, I pick up on present but subtle grassy hops, cut with some general citrus. It trends sweeter when the sip is held in, and especially on the swallow, where the malt comes in with sweet honey and cereal grain, all the while carrying citrus to cut through the sweetness  This has a medium body (heavier than I was expecting for the abv) and light tingly carbonation, leading to a smooth beer, but it feels a tad too heavy. Finishes sticky and wet  This was pretty good, but definitely past freshness for a lager. I'm sure it's better fresh, but I'm not sure by how much. At the very least, it's an easy drinking, affordable lager",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,VicCooper,4.02,"I’ve had this beer several times before, when I can’t decide if a lager or an IPA would be perfect for the evening, I usually pick this one.  Top: it forms an off white/light cream 1.5” head which fades into some lacing in a minute or two.  Colour: clear copper (dark amber), beautiful to look at. I wish the head would stay longer.  Smell: without decanting, the typical lager smell. Leave it for 5 minutes and it becomes a fruity, sweet malt scent, biscuity with some light fig and dried plum notes. Delightful. Reminds me Guinness’ Citra IPA (the look too).  Taste: American Pale Ale meets Pilsen lager. Moderated, yet distinctive czech style bitterness, good IPA-like fruitiness, some caramel malts, exceptionally balanced. Feels stronger than its alcohol content would suggest (ABV: 4.9%), but without the boozy tones.  Smooth mouthfeel, semi-dry finish, medium carbonation. Dried plum aftertaste, very pleasant.  Summary: a true gem. Try it, if you haven’t before, it really is a pleasant experience.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,DoctorZombies,3.23,"Deep gold/pale amber pour; excellent clarity; off white one inch of creamy head; very good cap retention; heavy ring; medium heavy lacing. Smells like a spicy lager poured into a cup of sandalwood incense. Taste is bready sweet malt/fruity yeast; light bitter green hops and pine; spicy woody backend. Medium light body, moderate carbonation; dry finish. Overall, I don’t like the taste, which reminds me of rancid apple juice; it’s fruity/woody/spicy with a bready base; add some bitter hops to the mix, and I don’t like the overall.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,dunkel_weizen,3.62,"Unknown age bottle into a pint glass. Golden copper color, great head retention and soapy lacing. The smell is reminicent of pumpkin, spices, and caramel malt. The taste flows suit, with some bitter hoppy zip on the end and some citrus that slides in there fairly easily. The finish is a rather dull component of the taste, hard to pin down but somewhat simple. The mouthfeel is a classic moderate dry, with great body.  Interesting ale style I am rather unaccustomed to, but wow it sure is tasty! It is also very drinkable!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,PathofChaos,2.89,"Appearance: An off-kilter amber that looks just like Stewart’s Original Cream Soda. A big dollop of creamed bubbles, the color of French vanilla, floats atop. Lacing and retention is apt to please any minimalist.  Bouquet: Dry malts that have been lightly smoked and salted, backed by a subdued, woody fruit aroma.  Feel: An edgeless, watery, light body, loosely stapled together by its carbonation. So thin I’m worried it’ll lose molecular cohesion and scatter apart into its constituent atoms.  Taste: Imagine if sandalwood were a fruit, and that fruit had been sandwiched with bready yeast and sprinkled with coarse, bitter, pretzel salt. In the aftertaste, a twinge of dry hops sprints by like its ass is on fire and its head is catching.  Overall: It’s like a lager and gose tragically collided at a lumber yard and ended up on the same hospital gurney. Their confused surgeon was unable to extricate the wicker basket of under-ripe pears that was mashed into their vitals during the impact.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,Hooded,4.46,"Notes from 5/20/2020. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Rastal nucleated Teku glass. The body is clear amber with 2 fingers of white head. Retention is somewhat above average leaving a nice cap. The intensity of aroma is medium-low. There are notes of caramel, and sweet malt. The intensity of taste is slightly below medium-high. Wow! That tastes great. The caramel and sweet malt flavors gradually sink below the tide of the bitterness which appears mid palate and is somewhat below medium-high. I finished the glass before finishing the review. I'll just open another bottle. The thickness is just above medium. It's fairly creamy, and has a medium level of astringency. I love the feel of the medium level of carbonation. It must be the natural carbonation the beer write up mentions because it's somehow unlike any carbonation in beer that I recall. Overall, it's a unique and remarkable world class beer. I like the bitterness of big IPAs and usually hate lagers with a lot of bitterness. I'm surprised I think so highly of this beer. This might become one of my absolute favorite beers.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,just1cho,3.88,"*Poured into a Teku glass at around 55F from a 12oz bottle for review. Drank the rest in a nonic pint glass*  Poured a clear amber with about a finger thick cream colored head. Had a medium amount of retention but a nice diversity of rocky and micro bubbles.  Upfront on the aroma, I got a pleasant fruity aroma of apples, some of the sweet malt, and a bit of cinnamon and cloves.  On the palate, it had a more malt forward character than what I got on the nose. Despite this, there was a nice balance between the sweetness of the malts and the bitterness of the hops in the middle, while here was a fruity apple aftertaste towards the end with a bit of bitterness from the hops. But nothing too crazy, nothing really stood out for me.  Was medium bodied and smooth. Had a nice crisp finish to it with light carbonation but had a slightly watery feel to it. Other than that, I felt like this went down super easy and had absolutely no alcoholic taste to it, making this super drinkable.  I liked this beer, but nothing about it really stood out to me. It reminded me a lot of American Pale Ales, but a little more watered down.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Medium-bodied and saucy but racy acidity stabilizes the lager nicely with the robust tannins. Deep red currants and ripe cherries, laden with mocha, loamy hops, charred malt, pencil shavings, roasted hazelnut. Dense like characters that make it perfect for watching football hanging out the with zizs'es. It is drinkable straight from the bottle once you expose it to the earth’s atmosphere.

I have never tried any other steam beer, so this one will always be a staple of California common/steam beer style for me.

Brewed early November, poured into a pint glass.  Look: Deep copper with a resilient white head. Frothy foam rests atop a glowing deep amber beer with rich copper edges. Tiny bubbles of carbonation rise through the perfectly clear liquid.  Smell: Gentle aroma of toasted grain, with inflections of slight buttery yeast and mildl grassy hops. Delicate lemony aroma, especially when ice cold but the head does its job and carries the scent of the grainy and delicious brew.  Taste: Refreshing lemony salinity upfront. Then light cracker and buttered biscuit malts. Subtle caramel hues adorn each gulp. Finishes dry and refreshing.  Overall: I love this unique, timeless, drinkable, and superb beer.

Smell is caramel, bready , some fruitiness that's not quite citrus, floral hops, with brief flashes of faint pine solvent.  Taste is fresh white bread crust of the thick & chewy (not dry/flaky) variety, light caramel, with a light mix of floral/pine/citrus rind hop flavor in the latter half of the taste. Those hop flavors are masked somewhat by some moderate pleasant bitterness that comes in at the same time, and lingers awhile.  Feel is light-medium, smooth, with a drying very fine carbonation tingle . A tad light on the carbonation, but only slightly so. If I wasn't reviewing it, I might not notice.  Overall, an easy-drinking, enjoyable, classic , that I'd highly recommend trying at least once.

28,63,biiru_ojisan,3.86,"Poured a crystal clear amber with a super creamy looking off-white head.  This bottle appears to have gotten a touch skunky, but I'm going to try to ignore it. I'm getting some floral hop notes and some bready and biscuity malt aromas.  The skunkiness doesn't seem to have made it into the flavor too strongly. Nice herbal flavors with the hops. Nice, light malt notes with the bread and biscuit making a comeback. Nice bitterness on the back-end rounds out any malt sweetness. A pretty pleasant drinker.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with maybe slightly less than moderate carbonation. Alcohol warmth is a little more present than you might expect from a beer at this strength.  Overall, this is a pretty refreshing sweater beer.

As the copy claims, the unique brewing method of this beer results in a singular—and satisfying—taste. It's like it mixes a stronger lager taste with a milder pale ale taste to create the perfect medium. Highly malty and carmel-colored like an amber lager but with a floral hint like an IPA. I'm very pleased to find a lower-alcohol beer that is as flavorful as this one. What I dislike about it is that the feel is rather sticky and the head doesn't last; no lacing. The carbonation is slight. The label, packaging, and bottle are delightful. I almost prefer drinking this one out of the bottle because its shape evokes the early twentieth century.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

The head is large, white, and very dense with a rippled surface. It looks perfect.  Aroma: There is a noble hop aroma that is spicy. It has a bit of a candy-like scent which is a bit of a mix of how rock candy smells and a touch of toffee. The hops smell lovely.  Taste: There is a bit of sweet caramel mixed with a light herbal hop flavor. It is slightly floral like a hibiscus. It is very pleasant to drink.  Mouthfeel: It's very smooth with a light bitterness. It has a medium-light body and a wash of carbonation.  Overall: It is simply an enjoyable beer that is also loaded with flavor, aroma, and character. I would recommend giving it a try. I enjoyed it and I would certainly drink it again. The high-point for this beer is how it has a lovely flavor that is a bit sweet and a bit herbal that lingers on the tongue.

28,63,joeagain,4.78,"To the uninitiated, Anchor Steam beer might be mistaken for an ale. With its copper color, hoppy and fruity nose, and somewhat yeasty character, it's easy enough to see why some might think it an ale. But it is indeed a lager.  Pours a nice copper color, with a beige head that lasts and lasts. Aroma is full of character, citrus and a slight bit of mint lead the way, with hints of caramel peeping through.  The body, as of late, has thinned out a bit, and it seems more carbonated than it once was many years ago. Still, its got a fair amount of oomph to it!  The taste is a cornucopia of flavors; earthy, citrus and minty hops lead the way, followed by malty flavors of caramel, raisin and old time brown bread. One tiny complaint is that the body seems thinner than it was only a few years back, but it'still a pretty darned good beer!

Also wanted to check out what Brace Belden does other than fighting ISIS and hunting pedophiles. L: Nice copper lager appearance. Didn’t get the nice head mentioned in other reviews from the first pour into a mug, but subsequent pours into a 40 cl Stella glass yielded a solid inch of white. S: Not fantastic. Not awful. Maybe French bread? A hint of hops. T: Unexpected. Surprised at the complexity here. Like brown bread with some molasses. Again, a hint of pine but definitely subtle. I prefer hops to be suppressed like capitalists during the Cultural Revolution. F: Bold, I would say. I wasn’t looking for a lot of weight though it isn’t light. Crisp. Good carbonation.

The taste is surprisingly balanced. I was expecting a syrupy malt bomb but a strong bittering hop bite is pronounced. The caramel malt comes through but instead of being overly sweet they used a high alpha bittering hop that really has a bite to it. I would say the mouthfeel is medium with a dry finish.

(4.50)  Aroma: Aromas of caramel, red fruit, pine, bread, biscuit, and toast. Caramel and sweeter bread comes through similar to Munich malts as the beer warms. Smells like a Christmas-pine, caramel cinnamon roll topped with nuts, toffee, and cherries. Little to no hop aroma. Zero roastiness. There is some nice woodsy notes too, similar to walking through a pine forest on a spring night after a rainstorm. (4.25)  Flavor: Strong and complex flavors. Strong cherry here. Bread, biscuit, light toast, but not roasted. Follows with a darker and richer caramel and toffee Viennea malt flavor. Maybe a bit of banana. Then a lot of red fruit and tart cherry. Finishes with a lightly hopped flavor of light minty flowers in a log cabin from the pine. Spicy and bitter finish with some lingering malt graininess that gives a pukey quality? But it's like a cherry-iced cinnamon roll. Cranberry and cherry. Finishes relatively dry for the flavor. Similar to an amber. (4.25)  Feel: Medium body and well-carbonated. For the flavor it's much lighter bodied.Dry finish, but leaves an mouth-coating astringency on the palate. (4.00)  Compared to a Vienna lager it is a touch lighter in color, but much more flavorful. More malty and toasty caramel and sweet bready quality. Less bitter and fruity. More savory.  Compare to Boston Lager: Pours darker. More of a pine, bitter aroma. More hops in the flavor of pine and cherry/cranberry. Finishes with more bitterness. Drinks more like an amber.  Compared to Alternate Dimension 3/19/20: Pours a lighter color. Aromas lean more toward red fruit & pine rather than. french toast, cinnamon, and roasty cocoa. Similar caramel flavor though which makes it tricky. Flavor is more of red fruit, caramel with a woodsy note rather than a smokey caramel & chocolate french toast. Slightly more malty and smooth. Similar and might be worth another comparison sometime.  Compared to Alaskan Amber 5/8/20: Pours a lighter color. More red fruit and pine. It has caramel but less. Less caramel, vanilla, tobacco flavor. Finishes lighter, more bitter, and less malty with less body. Drinks closer to a lager.  Overall: An absolutely beautiful beer. For 4.9% ABV this one has so much more rich flavors than your average beer. Cherry malt flavored, but dry. If one sentence could describe it I would say it tastes like a caramel cinnamon roll topped with nuts, toffee, and cherry oil in a lightly pepperpmint spiced log cabin.

28,63,Lingenbrau,5,"When you think of a California Common or a Steam Beer, if this isn't the first beer you think of, then the world is out of balance. This is it, the original, the one that started it all. Every beer of this style is, or at least should be designed around it. If that doesn't call for perfect marks, I don't know what does. Oh, and the real kicker... It's wonderful.  The color alone is special. Rusted copper, burnt orange, whatever you want to call it, it stands out amongst the masses. It's clean and refined looking, proudly wearing a cream colored foam cap that is fittingly creamy in it's own right. It looks refreshing and it looks delicious.  How this has such a low overall score is mind boggling. Clearly people have decided not to rate or review this beer to style because this beer IS the style. For years I've enjoyed Anchor Steam and many others of the Anchor family. But this one right here is a stranded on a desert island beer for me.

28,63,BilltownBrewingCo,3.59,"Aroma- There's a slight fruitiness, but what little aroma that's present is malt forward. Virtually no hop present in the scent.  Appearance- Lovely Crystal clear with a light Amber color, and beautiful off white head. A beautiful looking beer.  Body- Dry, with moderate and appropriate carbonation.  Flavor- A very slightly toasty malt that's highly attenuated, and therefore has very little if any sweetness. There is a faint yeast fruitiness that matches the aroma. It's quite understated and pleasant. All of this finishes out with a perfectly balanced amount of hop bitterness. There's also some earthy, grassy, lightly danky hop flavor typical of the northern brewer vertital.  Overall- Very solid beer, that would be easily sessioned. It isn't wildly flavorful or outstanding, but a well made, very balanced product.

Smell - Wet grass, caramel, a weird bit of funkiness. Not complex, but it's interesting.  Taste - Not nearly as funky as the smell made me expect. A little spicy but fruity, like a chili pepper or something. At the same time, it's light and refreshing, kinda like an AAL. Nothing really sticks out to me, but it's pleasant enough and well balanced.  Feel - The thin body matches with the taste, but the carbonation is a little high for me.

Taste follows the nose, with a somewhat faint, but well balanced interplay of doughy, caramel, lightly toasted malt and grassy, floral, lightly herbal hops and mild notes of red berries. Finishes with a medium bitterness and some toasted grains lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.  This kind of reminds me of an Amber Ale Light and I quite like that in a way. It may lack a strong, assertive flavor profile, but has a very nice, subtle balance to it.

On the nose, I can detect some roasted malt character and a crisp, if rather neutral hop aroma. The roastyness comes through in the taste, in fact, it reminds me somewhat of a dunkel except fuller bodied(which is to say, I'd consider this beer medium bodied), with a good amount of carbonation, enough you can feel it but less than, IMO, a pilsner or something equally highly carbonated.

28,63,casualbeerman,3.73,"This is the godfather of American craft brews, you could get Steam Beer from Anchor brewery as far back as 1971 (yes the brewery has been in operation since the 1890's and Steam beer as a style goes back even further but the current recipe was re-introduced in 1971). This predates Yuengling (1987 and no I wouldn't call that a craft brew but the beer most Americans drank and brewed was so bad back then that I'd argue it did quaify then, it did help raise the bar for us), Sam Adams (1985), and even Sierra Nevada (1980). That was really the reason why I bought myself a sixpack for the Fourth of July. Turns out this is a sturdy, tasty brew. I 'd also argue its fairly unremarkable. The look is fairly attractive to me. I'm primarily an American Amber beer guy. Even though Anchor says they use a combination of pale and caramel malts, the color leans towards the caramel malt side. Plus it has a very nice, prominent, stable, well-formed head, so of course I'm a fan. The smell is fine, though unremarkable. It smells more or less like beer, malty, a bit hoppy a bit yeasty. The taste: sturdy, simple, enjoyable. though unremarkable. There is a strong (and fairly sweet) malt character balanced by hop bitterness that definitely is not excessive, though also not overly complex. They use cascade hops, but it is not hopped with anywhere near the complexity or intensity of Sierra Nevada. This is not the most interesting beer in the world, (in fact I'd rate it a bit less interesting than any of the other 3 ""craft brews"" I mentioned that followed it), but this is still as solid brew. Mouthfeel, I rate highly because overall this has enough oomph to let you know you are drinking beer rather than water, but its still definitely sessionable. It even though it has far more flavor and character than your typical pale macro lager, I do not think I'd have any problem knocking these back all day. It also does not get any harder to drink as it warms. Overall, I gave this a 3.75. It's good and its uniquely American, and in the dark days of mass-produced domestic garbage, Anchor were arguably the first to show us that there was a better way. If I was around to drink in the 70's its possible that I'd drink pretty much nothing but Anchor Steam Beer. But in the 2nd decade of the 21st century, a lot of other brewers and beer drinkers have learned from these pioneers. We have a ton of alternatives, many more interesting, some cheaper, some both. I could happily drink this any time, and I'll probably get it again at some point. But my 6pack was $10. Granted they do use all 2 row barley, but stil, Yuengling Traditional brewed with some barley and some corn is better imo and costs $6, and if I want to spend $10 I can get stuff like Troegs Perpetual IPA. So while I think this is a solid beer, I don't think its the best pick around for the money. I agree everyone should try it at least once though.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Feel: I recall having some Steam poured from a tap a while ago and thinking it was rather thin, but I've just poured this one from a bottle and it feels more substantial. Either way, this is a lagerish beer, so the feel is appropriate for the type. It's highly carbonated, too, and that's really nice--the fizz makes it almost like a savory soda.  Overall: This was my first beer from Anchor, but it won't be my last! It has a lot of the qualities you get from other regional beers that have blown way up (think Fat Tire or Spotted Cow), chief among which qualities is a very pleasant drinkability coupled with enough character to retain street cred with the craft beer set.

Smell: Moderate strength and sweet. The malt bill is layered and subtle with notes of toasty pale malts, dried fruit, and faint caramel. Fresh, herbal hops with cedar-like notes are also present, however a bit milder than I expected.  Taste: Follows the aroma with moderate strength and bitter balance. The front is malty with notes of toast, dried fruit (raisins), and light caramel. What follows is fresh, herbal hops with pronounced bitterness.

28,63,Pantalones,4.02,"My last bottle from the six-pack I picked up semi-recently. Mysterious code on the back is ""7A8,"" whatever that might indicate... I can only assume it's a coded bottled-on or best-by date, but I don't know how to decode it and I'm a little more concerned with drinking and reviewing the beer at the moment rather than looking up exactly how old it is!  Everything is really nice appearance-wise -- deep golden color, bordering on the lighter orange range, and very clear with streams of little bubbles rising from the bottom. Forms a decently-sized layer of slightly off-white foam when first poured, shrinking to a thin coating within a couple minutes but staying fairly solid even then (no holes forming in it or anything just yet.)  Every bottle of this beer so far has really struck me with how fresh-smelling it is, and this is no exception. It's mild, but what's there is just a really nice bready smell with a crispness/freshness to it that's unusually noticeable even when compared to other lighter-to-medium beers that you'd expect to have that sort of feature to them. There's a bit of a hoppy thing in the background but the bready malt is the most noticeable smell right away.  The taste is also nice and bready, with a bit of a yeastiness to it that pops in and reveals its identity as not quite your standard lager after all. Very crisp and refreshing, as you'd expect going by the smell. A bit of bitterness on the end, a bit of an almost European-ish but not quite hop flavor going on, but mostly what you taste is a nice bready malt and the yeastiness that I'm guessing comes from the use of a higher fermentation temperature. The yeastiness almost takes on a quality that's somewhere between doughy and banana-y after a while. It's not a super complex beer but it is a tasty one. I recall being reminded somewhat of celery seed when I first had this beer, but I'm not getting much of that this time around. It's still very nice either way.  The feel is light, crisp, noticeably carbonated, and quite dry. Goes down pretty easily but it's not a thin, watery ""chug it!"" sort of beer, more one that you can either take a sip or a gulp at a time depending on how thirsty you are at the moment. I imagine people back in the 1890s way out in California would lean toward big gulps -- I bet this would be one of those beers that would be really refreshing to have cold and drink fast right after coming in from being out in the summer heat for an hour or two.  Overall, a great beer and one that I'm glad I finally got a chance to try. Try it for the historical experience of a surviving beer from the California Gold Rush, for the novelty of getting to sample an oddball beer style that you don't see around often, because the label art is really neat, or even just because you want a beer -- but it's definitely one that you should try at some point, one way or the other.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Deep golden to light amber, slightly hazy. Inviting overall appearance and I can tell this wont last long!  Malty in a great balance between pale and caramel. Not sweet, not tart not heavy, all is just right with this classic. Perfect summer day slammer, waiting on pizzas, and also accompanies the food very well on my 2nd one.

No ifs, ands or buts, but most people in their right minds know the refreshing qualities this beer brings out. And I rarely find any beer """"refreshing,"" but that's often a matter of opinion.  The fact that this beer found it's way into ballparks nationwide and being able to go to many ballparks around the US and I still see this beer alongside some newer craft beer trends tells me that this beer itself will stand the test of time.

This beer pours a deep copper color that is clear and features light carbonation. The head is thick, frothy, white and dissipates quickly to a rocky layer with a neck. 4/5 The aroma is quite strong with both toasted and caramelized malt, providing a bit of a burnt note while also being quite sweet. There are some grassy and herbal hops that come through and a bit of Grape Nuts as the beer warms. It comes across as very similar to a Sam Adams/Vienna Lager. 4/5 The caramel and burnt sugar lead off a fairly strong flavor profile that is a bit more sweet than bitter, but overall very well balanced. The same grassy and herbal hops return here and are joined by a bit of an earthy note. Bitterness is moderate and lingers for quite some time after swallowing. 4/5 This beer is moderately drying with a light carb tickle/prickliness with the dryness lingering after swallowing for a good while. I would characterize the body as being light-medium in nature. 3.75/5 This is a really enjoyable beer to drink. It is light while retaining a very good amount of flavor.

It's just a strange dichotomy of raisin and crisply bitter lager notes with a medium fluffy body that kicks up touches of grapefruit skin.

Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, this brew's head is three fingers thick and tawny, with webbed lacing, and a slightly murky brownish copper body.  I smell plenty of bread, or dare I say sourdough, malts alongside a slightly apple-y and copper scent near the end. Which I'll assume is accredited to the historical use of copper pipes at this brewery.  Tastes like pretty much the same components. Nothing bad, yet nothing outstanding either. Kinda just ""meh"".

28,63,ChristianAlexander,3.63,"A beer that's named as a homage to past times where 19th century steel and cotton mill workers lined up for miles after their fifteen hour workdays to drink locally concocted beer. These breweries of a bygone era utilized pipes to transfer simmering hot wort from the kettle to a fermentation tank which resulted in steam rising to the ceiling thus giving the beer its nickname. With a light yet subtly heavy taste, this beer is great for many pedestrians making their first steps out from the pavement of watery piss onto the highway of quality beer. Whenever I pass through San Francisco I make it my mission to visit this brewery for a couple or several beer flights before hitting the road again.

I'm not loving the current fad of making beers that are a citrus-y explosion (can we cram even more hops into a glass of beer -- If I wanted grapefruit, I'd buy grapefruit juice, not beer).  Poured into a Pilsner glass, for me the immediate aroma is very yeasty – similar to the water/yeast mixture when I’m making home-made pizza dough. That quickly fades but it still smells nice without being overpowering. I find it to be very flavourful – almost bread-like. The hops and malt are almost perfectly balanced. Carbonation feels very light in the mouth. The bubbles are small but there are a lot of them. The carbonation leaves a mild sting in the mouth. Overall a delicious, satisfying beer.  I loved Anchor Steam when I first discovered it back in the early 90's. And today it's the brand I buy most of the time. It's nicely balanced and I respect that they're a smaller company and they just keep doing their thing without bending to any new ""fad"" in brewing.

Alot of people say its got a unique taste.. but I think every beer worth its salt fits that category. This is simply a well balanced lager, perhaps on the heavier side (as lagers go) but that isn't rare among craft lagers. I suppose the brewing process does give it a slightly more fruity; ale like quality. Very slight however. It actually strikes me as a more raw Boston Lager if that makes any sense.

28,63,FBarber,3.9,"Pours a clear crisp amber color. Thin spotty white head disappears rather quickly. Lack of almost any head is disappointing.  Smell is nutty and bready. Fresh baked dark bread aromas come through. Simple, but very nice.  Taste has flavors of bread, nuts, slight hoppy bitterness on the finish, but ever so mild. Mild sweetness throughout reminiscent of maple syrup. Very nice flavor profile, simple yet very well done.  Feel has medium carbonation, light, and drinkable.  Overall I am really impressed with this beer. Its just a simple lager, but its very drinkable and tasty. Nice example of the California Common a style that Anchor pioneered.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

F: Feels light and crisp, and a little astringent at the end.  O: I really like this as a good alternative to more aggressive IPAs. It has a unique flavor, and goes down easy.

Sort of a clear amber look to it, a crisp aroma to it, with malts and some light hops. Tastes similarly crisp, with nutty and caramel notes and more bitterness to it than I expected. Feel was pretty carbonated, with probably contributed to the crispness I was getting. Overall this beer went great with the Dungeness crab I was eating.

Nonetheless, I really admire Anchor's classic branding, unique bottle shape, and good bottle cap design. Love these little California stubbies.  Smell: Soft, somewhat sweet malt notes. Standard sort of 'beery' smell. Some perceptible herbal and peppery hoppiness.  Taste: Really smooth and pleasant, especially on a hot summer day after working in the yard for 10 hours. Definitely more bitter than many other craft lagers, which was great to see. Nice herbal hop flavors without being hoppy, really. A well balanced flavor that is definitely more on the lager side of things than the ale side (there's some of that bready crispness).  Mouthfeel: Crisp, medium-low body, and high carbonation. Very drinkable and refreshing.  Overall: Perhaps one of the best summer beers out there and one that I'll certainly be adding to my rotation. Definitely recommended, especially for cookouts, BBQs, and outdoor summer meet ups.

28,63,Jraiona,3.63,My first tasting of this style. Poured into a Nonic pint. Poured a clear Amber with a moderate head with little lacing. A pleasant aroma of malt was quite prominent. On the palate there was light carbonation and a pleasant hopiness without being overly bitter (I'm not a fan of hop forward beers such as IPA's or bitterness).

28,63,Bierliebhaber3,3.85,"The beer that trademarked the term “steam beer” and the only beer considered a “California common” beer that I’ve ever tried. It is a beautiful hazy copper color with a fizzy white head. This beer is definitely more carbonated then most I’ve tried. Has a mild hop and strong malt character. Many people said that the hops really came through to produce a bitter initial taste for them, but I didn’t get it. Maybe I’ve been around too many IPAs, but the fact that I found the hops taking a backseat is a good thing to me. It has a mild fruit and possibly caramel flavor, but more than anything it just tastes like a really nice crisp lager. Reviews of the flavors in this beer are so wildly varied that it leads me to believe that maybe it changes a little from batch to batch. It was nothing earth shattering, but I can say I definitely enjoyed the one I got.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Taste was a touch of caramel sweet malts and just a touch of hops toward the back.  Mouth feel was a refreshing drink of cold beer with a nice crisp finish.  Glad I tried this one!

Since Fritz Maytag sold Anchor, the quality has noticeably dropped off on Anchor Steam beer.*  Michael Jackson the beer hunter got it right when he rated this 4 out of 4 stars (World Classic) decades ago. Absolutely a classic and a unique beer. Defines ""session"" beer. Perfect at 4.9% for a long night. Beautiful bronze amber color, plenty of hops, though not an IPA, the Northern Brewers really feature well in this beer. A great intermediate transition beer for someone coming through the ranks of craft beer drinking in terms of hop hit. I remember my wife drinking these quite a bit after moving on from low hopped bears like Newcastle and then finally liking IPAs after these.

A pretty subtle scent to it, but there's hints of caramely malts and some faint hop aroma. Taste is actually pretty layered. Starts out sweet and malty, with caramel breadiness and hints of things like licorice and raisins. As the beer travels across the palate, some floral hop flavors and subtle bitterness develops, finishing with a crisp and somewhat dry feel. Flavors are clean and bright. Feel is smooth and creamy.

My one issue is the lager yeast leaves a slight stink, it is IMO what other reviewers call grassy or ""skunky"". It's not skunky, just as many Euro lagers called skunky on the board aren't - look at many Heineken reviews - it's from the yeast, IMO.

Not much in the way of head or active carbonation, but there is the thinnest of caps that sticks around, like a light dusting of snow. Smell is hoppy, but not in a sharp or aggressive way; plenty of malt on the nose, too. Taste is unique. Light hops, and a clear taste of dark fruit (raisins?)

28,63,911CROFT,3.35,"355ml bottle into a conical 2/3 pint glass. Paid £1.79 for a single bottle.  Pours a clear, dark amber coloured body with a small amount of fine visible carbonation. A light, bubbly, two-finger in height, white head fades quickly to a patchy film and collar, leaving token amounts of spotty lacing.  Crisp, grainy, toasted malts and caramel lead the nose upfront. Mild grassy and floral hop profiles follow shortly after, along with aromas of lightly fruity yeast. The taste follows almost exactly, opening with crisp, toasted, pale and caramel malts before a vague fruitiness gently enters around the mid-palate. Light hop bitterness builds towards the back end, taking a mainly grassy form, along with some floral notes and perhaps a trace of citrus peel. In the mouth a light body and plenty of sharp, lively carbonation give a thin but clean and crisp feel. Moderately bitter hops linger just long enough in the finish to cancel out any residual malt sweetness, drying the palate slightly and increasing the sense of refreshment.  Overall this is a decent beer. It’s clean, crisp, refreshing, plenty session-able and widely available at an excellent price point (in the UK at least), but ultimately, so are a lot of other beers. Ignoring the history and heavy steam based marketing, judging on taste alone, this is probably still worth a try, but not worth seeking out specifically to do so.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

I was expecting a yellow fisy lager or a pilsner like looking beer. I was presently surprised at its darkness. Looks like a Vienna Lager! Poured a large frothy white head, completely filtered. 5/5.  S: Wow, I smell citrsy hops, sweet beady malt, toasted brown bread, grains. Combine all those together and you have a light but very fruity aroma going on from the malts and hop(not hops - its singled hopped with Northern Brewer). Its almost smells like an American Pale Ale.  T: This is a lager? damn fine one. Taste like an American Pale ale with a well defined malt body. Champagne like carbonation, sweet beady malts in the background. The hops make this one finish dry and clean. I figured the IBUs on this one gotta be real close to SN Pale, and guess what they are 35 and SN Pale is 37. Like I said kinda taste like a pale ale. Really surprised me on the taste.

The taste begins with biscuit malt and a slight caramel but it finishes fairly dry and bitter. It is a reasonably complex beer. It's medium in body and carbonation and a good session beer at 4.9% ABV. Overall, it's quite good.

That fruit and bready caramel maltiness come in to play with some astringency and a slight touch of sulfur around the edges on to the center of the palate. Lovely beer with medium amount of carbonation, and a head which lingers. This is a quiet unassuming classic that has a lot happening underneath it.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,someguyinohio,4.07,"This is a great beer, but for different reasons. Everyone here has detailed the character of the beer... Toasted malt flavors, caramel and sugary flavors, juxtaposed with hops, that don't get it in the way and that only balance the strong malt and biscuit flavors.  As a beer, this is a high quality beer definitely in the Lager category. Perfect for a Backyard BBQ beer on a hot day in July when you're looking for something not particularly strong, and not high in ABV.  As a craft beer, this beer may not impress your craft beer buddies. It is not a strong tasting beer. What it is - is an exceptionally well-balanced and soft-spoken beer.  This is the PERFECT beer to introduce to your Budweiser and Miller Lite swill drinking buddies. A beer that isn't too strong, and not too far left of center from what they're ALREADY drinking. And perhaps you haven't found the perfect beer to introduce them to... Now you have.  I think its the perfect summertime afternoon beer outside by the pool or grill. And if I have some Budweiser Buddie's coming by - and want to be a good host - I'll have this in the fridge for them, as the thought of buying Bud or Miller just makes me cringe.  It's a classic. Some of your Budweiser Buddies may think so too.  Cheers!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,Myotus,3.99,"Poured from a 12oz bottle (bottled 09Jul15) into a pilsner glass. LOOK: Pours with 2 finger's worth of off-white foam that actually started to increase in size (an incredible first for me). It grew about a finger's worth outside of the glass and cohesion kept the very dense foam head from spilling over. The head never decreased in size due to the plethora of medium and large bubbles ascending to the top. Amber-copper in color. Lacing is very thick but moderate and spotted. SMELL: Mild biscuity malt and caramel aromas entangle with subtle aromas of floral and spicy hops. Hints of corn can also be detected. TASTE: Mild flavors of biscuity malts and caramel first enter. 3 seconds pass as mild floral hop and subtle spicy and bitter hops flavors finally enter the palate. By this time, caramel flavors continue to press on, but biscuity malts have grown stronger. A subtle amount of corn flavors enter the palate lastly as all previous flavors persist. FEEL: Full-bodied with hints of carbonation. Goes down smooth and creamy. Finishes with a moderate dryness. NOTE: I usally don't like to taste corn in my beers, but this one managed it very well. The first of its style for me. I look forward to trying more.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,SitkaSteve,4.23,"Wait, what, huh, I've never said anything ever about this? No time like the right time for this. Every time, I've ever had it, always the pint glass. The appearance was a blissfully yellow transparency. Carbonation always feeds the head at a moderate pace. The head dissipates within/about less than a minute. Lacing speckles and slides into the beer. The smell is crisp sweet grains, light sweet corn, and sweet biscuits. The taste is basically the same. There's a sweet bready aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light bodied and speckles my tongue with sweetness from the corn and bread. Overall, hey, what's not to love! Its pure baseball park beer that has nothing obscure about it. To all of the bullshitters who say, its bland because it doesn't have the ""complexities"" of Alesmith's Speedway Stout or something else of that nature, ask yourselves this, why in the hell are we comparing apples to oranges. Praise to Fritz Maytag for creating a style that hasn't gone the way of the buffalo and when I wanna drink light, this is what I go for.

28,63,tekstr1der,4.29,"Jeez, took me about 20 years to revisit this. Great looking pour of chill-hazed copper with thin, though dense head. Aromas are excellent bready malt and caramel with a faint alcohol. All very complementary. Flavors are similar, thought the sweetness anticipated is subdued, and a clean/dry finish ensues. Slightly rough mouth-feel, but otherwise a winner. Wish I had more than one.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,thehyperduck,4.22,"355 mL bottle from a sixer picked up at the LCBO; best before Sept 2017. Listed at 4.8% and served barely chilled.  Pours a gorgeous, clear copper-amber colour, throwing up nearly an inch of fluffy, bone white-coloured head that displays superb retention. It gradually dissipates into a thick, creamy cap, leaving behind a curtain of lacing as it crawls downward over the next ten minutes or so. Very visually impressive, but the aroma keeps things in perspective for me. It smells clean, but straightforward - some bready, doughy malt sweetness, with a touch of caramelized sugar, earthy silage and fruit skins - I'm leaning toward apple and white grape, but the fruity facets of the nose are fairly ambiguous in stripe.  The flavour profile follows in the footsteps of the aroma - it is nowhere near complex, but you can tell that quality ingredients went into its making. Clean, bready barley malt sweetness is the name of the game for the first half of the sip, followed by a hint of caramel/honey sweetness and some additional ambiguous orchard fruit esters. It gets earthier toward the back end as the hops begin to strut their stuff, including wet hay mixed in with some floral notes. Bittersweet in the aftertaste; emphasis leaning towards the bitter, but still quite well-balanced overall. Light-ish in body, with moderate carbonation that offers up a restrained bite. Super-quaffable; rarely have I classified something as a ""session beer"" with more enthusiasm.  Final Grade: 4.22, an A-. Anchor Steam is a solid little brew, and one which the bulk of beer drinkers should find to be highly approachable. Indeed, it's not difficult to understand how this time-tested recipe has remained popular over the years - it is downright tasty and perfectly balanced. While there is certainly no shortage of more exciting styles to explore these days, well-brewed classics such as this will always manage to retain the business of consumers who appreciate a quality session beer. The quintessential steam beer, and totally a must-try.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Smell-The smell is simple yet satisfying. I smell English yeast and malts as well as a hint of grape skins at the end.  Taste-It’s heavier than a pilsner and richer than a lager. I can taste some West coast style hops amidst the malt-forward components of this beer. It has a rich biscuit taste with a dry hopped finish, but is not bitter. The caramel malts run rampant until the hops build on the tongue. There is a slight sweetness that is perfectly balanced by a tinge of hops.  Mouthfeel-It is a medium/light bodied brew, ample carbonation, and with a lingering toasty or oily aftertaste.  Overall- It is a very pleasant and unique beer that I was glad to try.

Feel: Kinda watery. Fun carbonation. Crisp and clean.  Overall: Gets all fives from me as it is a tent-pole of a brewing style. This is what all other Cali Commons are based on.

28,63,thebrood1987,4.44,Some light biscuit malts a very small tad of grain and a slight herbal/floral hop. Sweet bready/biscuit malts with an herbal/floral hop. It definitely seems like an old fashioned beer for lack of a better way to put it because it does have a bit of that grainy malt flavor but the richness of the malt and hop character definitely put it above your average macro. As the beer warms the biscuit sweet malt comes out and reminds me of a samuel adams lager. Very drinkable and a full body for only a 4.9 percent. Definitely an artfully crafted beer.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,DaverCS,3.7,"Pours Amber in color with 1/2 finger of quick dissipating head.  Nose smells like a classic lager but with a bit more malt and some roasty notes.  Taste is unique. Starts like a pilsner with a breadiness, hay, slight iron note, and lemony citrus. Then the malt kicks in with some sweetness and a slight earthiness. Additionally it has only a mild amount of carbonation, less than normal for a pilsner but slightly above or equal to an amber ale.  Overall slightly strange combination. It's like a light amber ale or malty pilsner, which isn't necessarily a good thing. I'm slightly puzzled about this beer. I see it pairing well with San Fran oysters with mignonette sauce. It gets a 74/100.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Solid four finger, leaving mountains and hills of cascading foam lace on the sides as it recedes at a pace that would make cold molasses blush. It finally settles at like, an off-kilter head, some places its two fingers, others its one. The body is dark amber, lemon tea colored, with about 80% opacity.  Aroma : Ginger! Orange slice. Roasted malts! A little white grape. And faint lavender, with light grassy hop. Bouquet is medium to strong.  Taste : Pale hops come out right away, with a rather sharp punch. But the ginger, orange, and roasted malts tend to balance that out a bit, however the hop wins the boxing match and it ends strong on piney hop and some orange muffin.  Feel : Buzzing, medium bodied, lightly creamy, ends crisp and sun-dried. Nothing substantial but appropriate.  Overall : This is a decent beer. Tastes more like an IPA with orange accents than anything. I'd have it again, but it's a bit hoppy for my tastes.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Some nice spices too.  Medium light body with medium carbonation. Smooth on the palate. Lingering finish with hop bitterness. Very dry.  I hadn't had this beer in quite a while and kind of wrote it off as an acceptable standard. Having been enjoying German beers recently, this one hit me quite nicely. A lot of American beers seem to lack the balance and subtlety that German beers have. I think this beer gets passed over because it's not sour, overly hoppy, or high ABV.

Feel: Smooth with perfect carbonation, light to medium body.  Overall: Steam Beer is a great session beer. Despite the overall lightness and low ABV there is subtlety to its flavor.

There's a nice mouth-coating bitterness, but the finish is light on taste and high on tannins.  F: The mouthfeel is like a flat soda -- a medium body that leaves me craving more carbonation.

S – Low caramel, fresh bread, grainy sweetness with fruity esters, apples and apricot. Hops are herbal and slightly resiny, with a touch of fresh mint.  T – Light caramel and minty hops, some low fruity esters and grainy malt. A touch sweet and then hop bitterness follows.  M – A touch of sweetness from the malt and then moderate bitterness to the finish. High carbonation, a bit sudsy. Aftertaste is bittersweet, following a moderately dry finish.  O – Similar to a lager in its smooth drinkability and accented bitterness, with the juicy, fruity character of an ale.

Smell: Not a lot to it, really, even after letting it stand for a while at room temperature and a bit of additional in-the-glass agitation. Floral and grain notes, mainly.  Taste: Oddly light - the best word to describe it would be 'clean'. It's got a hoppy-malty-fruity taste and lacks the usual bitter aftertaste. If anything, the aftertaste is more fruity than anything. Nothing to shout about, but definitely refreshing.  Feel: Again, a fairly light feel to it - some carbonation but manages not to be excessively 'fizzy'. Would be an eminently drinkable 'summer' brew.  Overall: not a style of beer I'm overly familiar with - I can't think of anything comparable in the UK off the top of my head - it's not a bitter and it sure as hell isn't like a lager either.

My first time trying this supposed classic beer from Anchor Brewing Company.  Poured into a Duvel tulip glass.  A - It pours a coppery golden orange body, not unlike that of an IPA really, with about two fingers of creamy off-white head. Leaves behind moderate thick lacing on the glass. Looks pretty nice.  S - A somewhat light yet pleasant aroma. Creamy yeast esters, toasted grains, & some light herbal / fruity hop qualities in the form of an appley / cidery sort of aroma.  T - Taste follows the nose - toasty grains, brown bread, mustiness, yeastiness, creaminess, some fruity apple-ish cider flavors, lightly herbal, and with a slight metallic note on the finish. Very tasty; simple, yet refined.  M - The feel is crisp & clean, with a residual bitterness / dryness on the palate. Light-bodied with good carbonation; very easy drinking.  Overall, an exceptional take on the Callifornia common / Steam beer style from Anchor Brewing. Definitely a beer I would be interested in having more of. Very recommended, especially for the style.

28,63,ThomasMetal75,3.75,"A- Anchor Steam pours a very thick white head. Nice lacing. It is dark orange/copper. There are tiny, if any at all, particles floating around. But mostly a light haze to the look.  S- I get a big spicy note out of this beer. A little bit of caramel. Brown bread crust and an underlying grainy scent (not adjunct in nature).  T- Big spicy flavor. Light caramel. Grains, but clean tasting. No adjuncts here in taste or brewing process. Hops are there for sure. Lightly floral. There is some kind of undertone of some funkyness or bitterness there too. That aspect is hard to describe in words. It's got ale and lager type tastes. It's like a sophisticated Yuengling. If you like that beer, this one is right up your alley.  M- Light to medium. Crisp, clean, and refreshing for sure. Pretty dry finishing beer. Carbonation plays well with the hop spice if that makes sense. Also has a good clean water taste.  *Overall this is a pretty unique tasting beer and style. Never had anything like it. It's like an ale, but it's a lager in style and taste as well. Some of the flavors are hard to describe without sitting down with a glass of Anchor Steam and figuring it out on your own.

28,63,doktorhops,4.19,"Anchor Steam Beer: one of the original steam beers. What's a steam beer? There's a fascinating story behind this style: Back in the late 1800's in California Lager was a fast growing style, however it was difficult to brew in the warm climate (Lager yeast works best between 9 to 14 °C and Ale yeast works best between 13 to 24 °C) so the brewers ""trained"" a Lager yeast to work at Ale yeast temperatures and BAM! Steam beer was born. Steam beer has the characteristics of an Ale but is technically a Lager.  Poured from a 355ml bottle into a nonic pint.  A: Hazy copper bodied with a cream coloured lush half centimetre head, bit darker than the other steam beers I've tried, however Anchor owns the trademark so this is considered THE classic steam beer.  S: Sweet caramel malts mingle with earthy and herbaceous hops providing a decent Ale aroma. There are also notes of peach and lemon lingering in the background giving the hops a touch of fruitiness as well.  T: Flavour is well balanced, but favours the sweet caramel malts a little more than the fruity/earthy hops. There is some lemon rind bitterness asserting itself in the finish and after taste. It also has this moreish quality that keeps you coming back for another sip, which is the sign of a well-crafted brew.  M: The mouthfeel of this beer is awesome - medium bodied with a creamy dense carbonation, not unlike a top shelf Hefeweizen.  D: This beer is modest in its entirety - it screams nothing, it just goes down easy and has the right balance and an interesting enough flavour to keep it unique - a class act all the way. The hard part is deciding which of the two Anchor brews I've tried that I like more, the Liberty Ale is also top-notch, hmmm... I am more of an Ale than a Lager man and the Liberty does tickle my taste bones, yeah I'm gonna go with the Liberty Ale FTW.  Food match: This is such a well-crafted and balanced beer that it would match with almost anything - Beef, pork, poultry, and fish they would all work with this, you decide.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,Midwestbrew18,4.47,"Appearance - Poured and Amber/Copper color with around a finger of head, give or take a couple millimeters.  Aroma - Very rich malt smell, deep biscuit characteristics, ending with a slight trace of citrus fruits, maybe lemon or orange. A floral scent can be detected as well, coupled with the citrus.  Taste - Caramel notes coupled with traces of citrus initially. Towards the middle of taste the biscuit/malt tones come in gradually and eventually dominate at the end on the palate. The hops used balance well with the malt, not a hoppy beer, but that was not the intent behind it. Delicious and simple flavors that are perfect for a hot day; very session able.  Mouthfeel - Medium to High carbonation and smooth throughout. Incredibly easy to drink, while bringing out enough flavor to keep things interesting. Easy to down many of these if you would want to. An absolutely refreshing beer.  Overall - Would definitely consider this for a hot day, tailgate, session, you get the picture kind of beer. Easy to drink, doesn't taste like hell after it warms up; in fact maybe tastier after it gets a little warmer depending on your palate. A simple beer, balanced well that provides you with maximum enjoyment and drinkability. Will definitely have to buy this again sometime. Very affordable by the way.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

S - Citrus and other fruits, very sweet but also a strange subtle vinegar smell.  T - Caramel, Biscuit to start. It definitely begins with a sweet malt kick then goes to the bitter citrus and floral notes at the end. Great for a hot day.

28,63,SmashPants,3.98,"Bottle: a stumpy brown 355mL bottle with a decent old-school label. Not sure about some of the corporate shtick though, like ""virtually hand-made"". Let's see.  Appearance: pours a very clear amber colour with a strong orange against the light. A one-finger off-white head hangs about for a short time before settling to a thick cap. Vibrant carbonation, with a limited lacing.  Aroma: summer fragrances - sweet biscuit malts, some floral, with citrus and orchard fruits. Refreshing.  Taste: much more driven by the sweet biscuit malts than the hops. There are some citrus and floral hops in there, which is nice, but the malts dominate. A buttery caramel hanging around the back as well.  Aftertaste: some more of the hop bitterness comes through on the finish. Still quite sweet, however. A lovely and refreshing beer.  Mouth feel: quite heavy in body with more carbonation than I was expecting. Brings the flavours through fantastically well. Well done.  Overall: I was quite stunned by this beer. A very refreshing combination of sweet malts and refreshing hops. Goes well with itself or particularly with a nice dinner. What surprised me the most was the price. I expected the usual premium U.S. ale price of AU$150+ for a case of 24 x 330mL, but at only half that, this beer is not only a gem, but a bargain.

Lacing moderate. Looks lager-like.  Aroma: Standard lager aromas; some toast, some caramel. I doubt anyone drinks Anchor Steam so they can smell it. It does smell crisp and clean.  Taste: Follows the nose, but is much more flavorful than the nose alludes. Crisp, clean lager-like flavor, with bready maltiness upfront. It has a nice, firm malt backbone and a modest amount of hop bite. It's a nice reminder that lager-style beers can be full of flavor even though we tend to associate them with macro crud.

28,63,GMB,4.15,"A standard pour of Anchor Steam Beer yields a medium amber brew and a slightly off-white head with less staying power than expected. Golden highlights appear when the beer is held against a backlight. Carbonation is moderate.  The nose is less impressive than I recall, but nonetheless inviting. Toasty malts are clean and up front. Lingering in the background are some musty, grassy hops; no herbal or floral qualities are appreciable.  Balanced bitterness is the key to this beer's flavor profile. Bittering hops immediately assert themselves, and blend with toasted grain flavors to create woody, rustic flavors. Damp hay, freshly cut lumber, and just a hint of apple cider on the back end.  The mouthfeel is slightly astringent, but the beer's fullness nicely complements its earthy flavors, and a whirl around the tongue kicks up some respectably dense foam.  Overall, a much better beer than I remember. This is what hoppy bitterness is supposed to do to a beer's taste.

In fact that the clarity seems quite conspicuous, almost as if there is an absence of something as in a Kristalweizen.  S - Sweet malts, concentrated apple juice, a little fresh-lager hoppiness. Apricot jam and honey. The notes definitely develops as this beer sits and warms.  T - The taste is well-balanced; malt and hop play together nicely, but the experience is a little tame and I get none of the fruit from the nose.  M - Mouthfeel feels about right as well. Not overly or underly carbonated. Neither cloyingly thick nor feebly thin.  O - This is an okay beer, but I have no idea when I would drink this beer were I to have again. It is quite refreshing but there are certainly more refreshing beers around. It’s sessionable but I’d rather session a beer with stronger fruit, nut or malt profiles. It’s not particularly hoppy which is fine by me as I don’t enjoy the hops but if I did like hops I’d choose an IPA. It’s relatively inexpensive but if I really want to get after it there are cheaper beers with higher abv’s. It doesn’t taste bad, but if I want a tasty beer I’m going to have some variety of porter, stout, Belgian or sour. It is well-balanced which in this instance is somewhat of an inadmirable virtue as it renders a neutral beer which fails to offer a definitive characteristic required to compel purchase. There are various reasons why I buy beer, but there is not a situation I can think of where another beer would not better compliment that reason.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

It's well-hopped, but not overwhelmingly so.  M: Clean, crisp, medium to light bodied.  O: Anchor Steam has not failed to deliver on any of their beers I've had so far and this is no exception.

28,63,falloutsnow,3.33,"From: Piccadilly, Champaign, IL Date: Bottled 2013-10-19 (3ON on label) Glass: Tulip  Anchor's Steam Beer is an enjoyably mild, yet modestly flavorful beer that highlights bread-like malt sweetness and subtle hop bittering, leading to a United States counterpart to sessionable German ales. While I've had more flavorful beers in a beer of similar strength, few of them are priced as affordably as this Steam Beer, making it an easy go-to for a balanced, though malty, beer.  Pours a 1cm tall head of white-colored foam, made up of small-sized bubbles yielding a frothy appearance, with average retention of about one minute, falling to a thin ring around the perimeter of the glass. Lacing is modest, but present, with a sparse scattering of small dots clinging to the glass' walls. Body is a fairly dark golden orange color, with light bringing out brighter golden orange hues. Carbonation visible through the transparent body, low in number and activity.  Aroma is malt-forward, of bread-like pale malt and modest straw, toasted bread and pale caramel-like sweetness. Little hop presence, what is present is the result being a mildly sweet and bread-like aroma.  Overall flavor of pale malt sweetness with a bit of toasted bread and light, pale caramel-like flavor; hops are tucked into the background, contributing a bit of bitterness and slightly herbal and woodsy flavor. Front of palate tastes lightly grainy and bread-like malts with toasted and pale caramel-like sweetness. Mid-palate of pale, lightly toasted, and pale caramel-like malt sweetness at fairly low levels with a hints of herbal and woodsy hop flavor and bitterness. Back of palate experiences lightly toasted bread-like malt, pale malt sweetness, and mild herbal and woodsy hop flavor and bitterness. Aftertaste is lightly grainy and bread-like, with low herbal and woodsy hop flavor and bitterness.  Beer is medium-bodied, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a lightly foamy (2/5) and otherwise smooth (3/5) body that's well-suited to the particular beer and style in general.

28,63,Hops4Pops,4.47,"Bomber Bottle. I had to try this because it was this beer that was the inspiration to Greg Koch, CEO of Stone Brewing, for going into the beer brewing business. I have changed my rating to a higher level based on several things: 1. There was no refrigeration when this style was created and when this brewer went into business. 2. They actually created this style, Steam Beer, and were very creative at the time in making a lager work. 3. I have respect for elders and this company is one of the eldest. Forgive me Bros for having to go through the second act and letting it warm to room temperature to get the essence of this style and this beer. A: Aggressive pour. Giant, slightly off-white head slowly receding into a cloud like formation and then slowly settling to a foam across the surface. Sticky lacing on the side of the glass. Reddish amber color. S: Smells kind of fruity but not sure which fruit. Some hops. Some malt. T: About the same. M: The carbonation gives it a little bite and the rest is pretty smooth. Easy on the mouth. O: I guess I am seeing the Bros rate it so highly due to the respect it deserves for longevity in the brewing industry and the true to style characteristics based on the fact that Anchor Brewing actually created the style. Its a very drinkable beer but not my favorite style in general. If you like this style, this beer pretty much defines it. While I tend to gravitate to stronger, more robust, modern styles, I can see however where 150 years ago, brewing this kind of beer was a most awesome achievement!

28,63,BVukelich,3.51,"Poured from the stubby 22 into glass. It created a light tan, 1-finger head. A little darker head and color than I remembered. It's been a long time since I've had this one. The creamy head lingers nicely and leaves very decent lace. I honestly didn't pick up much on the aroma, slight hops. The beer is very dry, skews malty but leaves a pronounced bitterness. Clean finish. It is busy in the mouth and appears very lively in the glass with its active carbonation.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,barczar,3.72,"Pours a brilliant golden copper with a dense light khaki head that slowly dissipates, leaving sticky lines of lacing.  Toasted nutty malt and caramel are met with light fruity yeast esters. Earthy and floral hops are subtle. There's a metallic note present.  Flavor follows suit, with lightly fruity esters underlying a rich, nutty, toasted, slightly caramelly sweet backbone, which becomes bready and dry at the finish. There's a slight touch of earthy bitterness, with the metallic character lingering in the aftertaste.  Body is moderate to a touch light, with a moderate, prickly carbonation.  The metallic note is offputting, and I know the esters are a byproduct of fermenting lager yeast at ale temperatures, but it's still a weird combo. Great malt backbone, and fairly refreshing.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,BoldRulerVT,3.93,"Poured from a 22oz. bottle into a snifter. A nice light amber color with moderate bubbly head. Smells are light malts and light caramels.

28,63,JeanDuteau,3.73,"I've been drinking Anchor Steam Beer for awhile as my ""what is that beer?"" of choice, i.e. the ones that get my friends talking when I pull it out.  Upon pouring, it has a nice Amber colour with a decent head. There is not a lot of carbonation bubbles but it still has some kick when drinking it. It smells quite crisp and has a little bitterness to it. You can taste some of the hops, but it is not overpowering. There is a bit of an aftertaste but nothing bad. You can feel the beer on the front and back of the mouth.  I would suggest this as a nice beer to try if you want some hops but don't want to go all crazy with an American IPA.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,admiral,3.75,"A solid beer with a rich taste and look - recommended as a session beer  aroma: fruity caramel sums it up  taste: a rich taste with grapefruit, spice, pepper, plum, white wine and slight citrus, slight banana with some nice malt to balance it out  a nice beer but nothing that makes it outstanding - solid and tasty",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Aaron_Ramson,3.99,"Small head that dissipated quickly and an amber body with excellent clarity. Nose to the bottle, smells like grain husk, cereal, a slightly medicinal, rubbing-alcohol scent detected.

Well balanced, tasty and extremely satisfying.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Taste: A nice malt backbone that is complemented nicely with a little hoppy taste.  Mouthfeel: Very crisp, smooth, and drinkable  Overall: A great lager. I would have no problem buying a six pack of this when I come across it. I definitely recommend this beer!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Maninthearena,3.64,"Appearance- Effervescent with a foamy head as advertised. Bronze translucent color with fine rising carbonation.  Nose- Pale and biscuity malts float over the top, malt drink like. Some pale floral elements.  Taste- A little toastedness and some more malt, but not too sweet. A good balance of mellow hop flavor throughout the sip. A pithy/earthy bitterness. Some spice and pepper components in the mix. Some caramel malt blends nicely with the hop oils.  Mouthfeel- Probably my favorite component of this brew, great texture and drinkability. Crisp while maintaining a smooth quality. Creamy without feeling heavy, surprising given the fine carbonation.  Overall- My first steam beer, so nothing really to compare it too. Although compared to other lagers, it is a very natural feeling beer. Not too many crazy flavors, just a good clean well crafted lager.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Scipio,4.5,"One of the first non-Sam Adams craft beers I ever drank. A perennial favorite when I was attending college. This is one of the best-looking beers in the world. Like all California Common beers, it has a beautiful head and great effervescence. The aroma is unique, and the malt/hop balance may be perfect.  This beer is a testament to Anchor's dedication to quality. It's archetypal, like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale or Bell's Amber Ale. Few beers are as good, and even fewer are better. If you're looking for a gateway to craft beer, this is it.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,tmm313,3.96,"Appearance: Pours a bright transparent amber with 1/2 finger head. Dissipates pretty quickly. Good lacing.  Smell: Was not expecting this in the least. Pear, apple, caramel, slight citrus hops and sweet spiciness. Just a touch of booze. It reminds me of a sweet white wine.  Taste: Bready with slight caramel malt. Finish is a rush of sweet pear, apple juice, piney hops, and soft pepper.  Mouthfeel: Super light and refreshing with crisp carbonation. Dry finish with bready, fruity and peppery aftertaste.  Overall: This one caught me completely off guard. I was expecting a lager and got something more similar to a fruit beer. And a pretty good one, too. Hot summer days beg for this beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Lacing quickly fell and all trace of head was gone before glass was empty. Color is pale amber with gold hue. Crystal clear and effervescent.  Aroma is faint and crisp – biscuit and caramel malt with very little detectable hops. Bits of fruity ester.  Mouthfeel is dry and thin. Heavy carbonation tingles and leaves a saltiness.  Taste is dry and caramel with raison notes. Finishes with noble-like alpha acid that lingers on back of tongue.  Overall: This is a crisp and refreshing beer that is definitely sessionable. Really stood out from the crowd of American Lagers during its time, but now is relatively non-distinct.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,TJ_B,3.4,"I am not a lager person in general and so It's not entirely fair for me to review this beer, but oh well. The beer has excellent dark amber color and has an excellent aroma. It is a somewhat thick lager so the mouth feel wasn't what I expected. I really don't like wheat beers and the taste, again it's a lager so maybe it's not ideal that I delve into this, was very wheat-like. The beer starts off decent, but through the heavy mouthfeel and thick grain taste I normally call it good after one. Most anyone else reviewing this beer raved about it so it's probably just me, but this isn't a ""go to"" beer for me, but I'll drink it if it's this or commercial beers available.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,spoony,3.76,"From a 355 ml bottle (code says 3G9) into a nonic glass.  A-A normal pour produces about two fingers of dense, off-white foam. Retention is decent and little flowers of head remain on the top of the beer for more than two minutes. Not much lacing left on the glass, however. There are a few chunky bubbles visible in the mostly-clear orange/tawny liquid.  S-The smell is a bit earthy with mildly sharp, grassy hops and bread-crust and cracker flavors verging into semi-caramel and fruit. The aroma is nothing special, but not bad for the style.  T-The taste is a bit grainy and the light-caramel malts carry through from the nose to the palate. There is also a bit of light fruit sweetness. Hops are mild, and of the grassy, earthy variety.  M-The brew is wonderfully drinkable. Heft is light to moderate with crisp, bubbly, chunky carbonation that never feels fizzy or soda-like.  O-I'm glad I finally got around to reviewing this classic. It is lighter and more quaffable than I remember, but a a great example of this style nonetheless. At times, it reminded me of an English mild and other times of a German Pilsner. The whole package is a bit rustic, but the easy drinking nature of this brew would make a great session/football watching beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,BMMillsy,3.1,"Pours into tulip from bottle a beautiful clear copper with small white head. Aroma of sweet mild malt, pears, some florals. Flavor is admittedly mild but definitely session able.

Better sessionable brews though.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Darkmagus82,3.87,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass  Appearance – The beer pours a nice amber-copper color with a big billowy just off white head. The head has a fantastic level of retention, very slowly fading over about a 5-10 min time period to leave a light level of streaky lace on the sides of the glass.  Smell – The aroma is mainly a mix of some more grainy smells mixed with a caramel sweetness. Along with these aromas there are some lighter hop smells of an earthy nature and a bit of grass.  Taste – The taste begins with a dry bready and grainy flavor with a bit of an earthy taste. There is a light caramel sweetness throughout the taste that is most intense at the beginning (although still very light) which almost disappears toward the end of the taste. While the taste has a hop bit at the start with the earthy tastes, more hop of a grassy and light citrus nature come to the tongue bittering the taste as it moves on. Some woody flavors come to the tongue more toward the end of the taste, with the combination of flavors leaving a rather dry, malty and decently bitter flavor to linger on the tongue.  Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the average side in terms of thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is average to just above average. Both the moderate body and carbonation are rather good for the mix of dry and bitter flavors, making it a good easier drinking brew.  Overall – A nice dry tasting steam beer that is very easy to drink. A good go too for something on the lighter side.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

T- Bittering Hops show right out front and followed by some malt sweetness, but somehow finishes dry.  M- Has a smooth mouthfeel, carbonation does not get in the way.  Overall- Good beer for watching a ballgame, with lots of hop and malt character. Best with strong flavor foods.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Ac2013,3.4,"Poured into a pint glass from the bottle. Small, quickly receding head soon left after the pour. Initial smell is complex, but the combination of hops and floral tones makes it pleasant. The taste is sharp, but I think it lacks a full flavor. It is still very good though. A very sessionable beer as the palate is clean after drinking. A historic brew and certainly worth the try.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,MaineBrewing,3.75,"A - poured a brilliant clear golden color with orange to amber highlights. Light 1/3 finger head didn't last long, no lacing whatsoever.  S - aroma is a soapy corny malt sweetness with slight alcohol.  T - taste is a surprisingly more complex for what I was expecting, at least more than what I got from the nose. Very light and crisp much like a generic AAL, but with a almost British character reminiscent of something from Samuel smith but much fresher, a very biscuity, nutty, caramel malt character with buttery diacetyl overtones. Low to no hop flavor but a balanced bitter finish that ends dry and refreshing.  M - light, light carbonation, dry finish.

Great refreshing beer, simple and straightforward but still very interesting.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,fabiansoliz,3.55,This is the beer of choice when visiting San Francisco. It's somewhat of a dark beer but without a very heavy flavor. It's not a light beer and after only a few rounds the beer tends to give me that intoxicted affect.  I also had this in the bottle and didn't notice any differences. It definately has a signature taste. There is also a light lager version that I tried and it's probably what I would switch to when I'm ready to keep drinking.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Mouthfeel is nice medium body with fairly peppy carbonation that suits this brew perfectly. Mouthfeel and carbonation defiantly aide the flavor on this one.

28,63,dwren89,4.35,"Appearance: amber gold with thick moussey white head and great clarity  Aroma: Northern brewer hop showcase, with woodsy and minty aroma and a clean lager like bready malt aroma  Taste: very much like aroma but with a beautiful malty finish that is very bready with a slight toast to it. Very nice, rustic and woodsy flavor with hint of mint and a great bready malt character holding it all together.  Mouthfeel: very hybrid between the cleanliness of a lager and the range of an ale. Medium carbonation, smooth and refreshing  Overall: Delicious. An american classic that is a hybrid between an ale and lager, the unique brewing process (which is worth looking up for those who don't know what a Steam Beer is!!) gives the pleasing versatility of this beer. The northern brewer hops mix perfectly to give the woodsy, minty, and overall rustic hop flavor.

The aroma was very light and was rather difficult for me to pick anything out. The only smell that could be picked out were the malts, but again it was so light, I couldn't get a full appreciation for it.  T. Like the smell, the taste is also very light. It is very light and crisp. The maltiness is quietly followed by the hops.  M. It has a slight and quick feel of carbonation initially then disappears within a blink.

It tastes great and is an excellent beer to sit and relax with.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,CalgaryFMC,3.85,"A true classic. I have had this one many times and find it to be a nice refreshing summer beer with more character than a macro lager and enough complexity to keep things from getting too dull over the course of a session. Pours a deep amber on the SRM scale and leaves a nice rich foam if you pour the beer correctly (although with this one I often dispense with the glass). Aroma is a sweet and spicy combo of bready spicy yeast and herbal notes with some sweet malt. Taste is where the magic is, sourdough yeast, cleansing spice like white pepper, some banana and vanilla esters... A nice sour tang with a decent biscuity crystal malt lingering sweetness on the palate. Drinkable but not dull. Might underwhelm those who love hop bombs as the Northern Brewer are there to provide grassiness and a bitter foil rather than complex hop aroma but keep an open mind. There is enough ale character in this hybrid style to keep one engaged.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

The beer is a beautiful copper color with yellowish highlights and is quite effervescent.  I smell lots of sweet malt with some mild floral hops.

T: A nice caramel malt profile is present. Some what sweet initially but is backed by some nice subtle hops. Fairly clean in terms of esters and phenols but still some very slight fruitiness comes through which is somewhat unique in terms of what is typical in lagers.  M: Crisp and clean. Very refreshing.

Unique flavor, predominant taste of peppery yeast, apple juice and biscuit malt. Notes of earthy hops and honey, with hints of lemon, minerals and salt. Not really sweet. Dry with an elegant bitterness aftertaste. Light body with low carbonation. Initially, it seemed not to be a big deal, but then it kind of grew on me for its unique taste. Though it resembles some British bitters. I could have drunk a few, very drinkable. Definitely worth it a try.

28,63,utopiajane,3.9,"Pours a beautiful clear copper color amber with plenty of foam and good retention. Bubbles rising from the bottom. Beige head that left soapy wet lace and a layer on top. Very pretty beer. Nose is simple. A touch of sour yeast, some caramel malt and a bit of fruit. Malt is a touch toasted and grainy. First taste is some light citrus that washes over the palate like a gushing stream, then some hop bitter settles in on the mid palate. The malt is smooth toasted grain. There's a light sweetness and lager yeast. The malt is woody and earthy. The body of the beer is medium/ light and smooth. To look at it you would think it's very sweet but it isn't. It drinks so easily that you never notice how fat the malt is. Finish is dry and grainy.  This beer has a classic and clean taste that is enjoyable to say the least. The hops are soft yet bitter and drinks like a lazy afternoon. Friendly and approachable. Would pair well with black bean burgers and would compliment a variety of vegetarian dishes. Would also go well with spicy foods like chili or sweetly smoky foods like barbecue. It's versatile.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,artoolemomo,3.68,"Appearance- Pours up a good amount of head with minimal retention. Some lacing is left behind. The body is off white with hints of yellow while the body is a little hazy with an almost medium amber/honey hue that glows orange when held up to the light.  Nose- Fairly subdued- takes a quite a bit of probing around and swirling to get something more than the sweet malt and stereotypical beer aroma. Grain, sweet malt, and a slight hint of sour spice are the dominant aspects but hints of caramel do come out later. Some fruity esters come out as well- some faint peach, apricot. Some complexity but very subtle.  Taste- Initially, citrus notes followed by woody bitterness with some resin. The bitterness is well rounded and is never overpowering. I had never noticed it before, the Northern Brewer hops do give a mild minty flavor which hangs around the wood of the profile. The hops also have a herbal/floral spiciness to them as well. Some biscuit, some grain but the caramel (like on the nose) is pretty tucked away. The dual use hops really stave of the possibility of any of the malts taking over the palate. Not the most complex beer but it is a very solid and well balanced one.  Mouthfeel- Between light and medium bodied. Lots of carbonation but the zip is welcome.  Drinkability- Very easygoing.

28,63,BethanyB,3.44,"Appearance: Clear, dark gold. A thick cloud of an off-white head.  Smell: Sinus-clearing mint and citrusy hops on one end, and plenty of grainy malt on the other. As a whole, however, the aroma is light and clean.  Taste: Earthy bitterness and a tart character overpower the biscuity malt. Altogether, the taste is much less complex than I had expected.  Mouthfeel: Medium-light mouthfeel and high carbonation keep the brew crisp and clean.  Overall: More flavorful than a lager, yet more simple than a typical ale. It's a solid beer, but not one that sparks any real interest for me.

28,63,BigJim5021,3.75,"My old review of this beer was pure shit. It was back when I thought every beer had to be huge or insanely hoppy.  Just know this. Anchor Steam is a true American classic. It's everything Anchor intended it to be, and anyone that appreciates good beer should have one every once in a while to remind themselves of where the movement began (I know this isn't literally the first ""craft"" beer.

28,63,dougbassett,3.69,"One of the ""1001 Beers You Should Taste Before You Die"" -- #27 of the ones I've reviewed here.  A pretty important beer for America, historically -- along with Sam Adams and a couple others it helped to kick off the microbrew revolution. Add to that on the East Coast it was never easy to get (it's not really *hard*, especially nowadays, but it's not omnipresent the way Sam Adams Boston Lager is) and it quickly developed a reputation (at least when it came out) as something extraordinary.  I like a lot of Anchor Brewing's beers, so I hope the Beer Gods don't curse me when I confess that I've never really been enthusiastic about their flagship beer. It's okay, but to my mind little more -- about on a par with Sam Adams Boston Lager, in fact. Pours a nice golden-caramel brown color but keeps no head, which may be part of the style (I don't know, actually) but is disappointing nonetheless. A mildly fruity nose which is pleasant. A very spritzy, effervescent mouthfeel, in fact I think that's probably the most notable thing about Anchor Steam, it has a consistency very different from most beers I know. The flavors are pleasant and well-balanced but nothing really extraordinary: some toast, some caramel, some hop bitterness, a rather nice, lingering finish that balances the malt and hops (the finish is very nice, actually).  It comes across as damning with faint praise, I know, but there you are. It's not a bad beer by any means, just to my mind rather overhyped (and overpriced, to be honest). What it really is, when all is said and done, is a solid session beer, not that far removed from Boston Lager. Folk who've drank a lot of Sam Adams and have never tried this really should, they'd probably like it a lot.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

There's a fairly solid hop presence and even some sourness up front. The flavors arrive early and linger around for a while.  M- Very unique mouthfeel. Creamy, slick, and slightly oily.

The smell is impressive though. It's nutty, caramel and has notes of ripe banana esters. The taste has notes of vanilla and some nutty tones, but it is balanced by a hop finish, balanced and appetizing. Mouthfeel is medium to medium full.

28,63,tectactoe,3.48,"I've had this numerous times, just never really got around to taking notes on it. Seems like they have this all over the place in downtown Detroit on tap. Had this particular one at Park Bar. Pours a muddled copper color with lighter hues around the edges, closer to a rustic amber; half clear and half hazy. Slightly gray-tinted head turns to a skin and leaves some small dripping of lace on its way down the glass.  The aroma is pretty bleak and mild; but relaxing and calm may be a more appropriate description. Musty hops, seemingly of the Noble variety (perhaps Saaz?) with a slight touch of leafiness to accompany the musk. Faint grains are the backdrop for the hop play, yet they remain fairly quiet and never interrupt. Very light citrus zest on the tail end. Warming doesn't reveal any more aromas; this beer is pretty simple and straightforward.  The taste begins with a small mouth washing of light biscuit malts and heavy grains; a substantial hop bitterness hits the palate quickly up front and fades away during the remainder of the sip. Citrus zest, lemongrass, and a faint herbal tea leaf flavor comprise a good majority of the rest of the flavor. The finish contains some heavier lager yeast, leaving a crisp and mouth-coating finish; light bitterness and an even lighter fruit zest. Thin bodied with a different mouth feel - borderline ""creamy"" considering the style and thin body. Lots of carbonation.  Easy drinker; relaxed, mild, and highly quaffable. Nothing tremendous in terms of flavor or aroma, but then again, nothing off-putting or offensive, either. I respect the originality of the style but I think I prefer ""Steamy Windows"" from Liberty Street over this one, despite its history as the precedent-setter.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

M - Has a nice tingle from the carbonation. Medium bodied beer that stays crisp the whole way through.  O - Solid beer that really embodies what a pilsner should be.

Aroma: The first thing that came to mind was pineapples and rockmelon, but this was followed by some malt and graininess.  Taste: Initially, I actually could taste pears, but this disappeared after a few sips. The rest of it was a bit citrusy (grapefruit & lemon rather than orange) and a bit sharp. Some wholemeal bread and black pepper in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation, medium body. A little sharp and 'zingy' on the middle of the tongue, but not in a bad way. Finish was a bit dry.  Drinkability: Well this was my first California Common, and I wasn't really sure what to expect.

Summary - Anchor Steam is really a great beer. It's hard to explain, but it is just so smooth and balanced and drinkable. There is just the right amount of hops and sweetness.

It has a very active head of off-white bubbles and promises to be pretty active on the tongue. I've recently become a fan of the Northern Brewer hops and they definitely work well on the nose of this beer. The beer is very much full on malt and caramel with that distinctive lager yeast smell of fresh baked bread. The Northern Brewer hops play well to the background with good woodsy and minty smell to the background. The taste is fairly mild, but like expected, very active. It's a good malt and caramel backbone with that great scrubbing of the Northern Brewer hops giving that woodsy taste and a touch of lemon rind maybe to it. The mouthfeel is very full bodied and again, very active carbonation. This is a great session beer and very good overall.

Anchor Steam is a beer that I've wanted to try for awhile now, but just now decided to finally order one and get my first taste. I had never had a beer of this style before, so I was actually surprised. With the ABV and the name ""Steam"" beer I was expecting a light beer that was light on flavor and pretty much a slightly better version of an adjunct lager... it's better than that. The smell is of malts with a fair amount of hops. The taste has mild hops on the front, with a malty and bitter finish. I was not expecting this beer to taste the way that it did, but I enjoyed it. I had Black Crown by Budweiser just last week, and honestly, this tastes like a craft version of that beer. It has a similar malt aftertaste with a trace of wood, but with a bit less sweetness and more bitterness. Clearly, this beer is MUCH better than Black Crown will ever be, but that's a beer a lot of people are familiar with that I would compare this one to.  Would not exactly be my beer of choice (There's nothing offensive about it at all and it's a solid, craft beer), but it's a very respectable beer with a lot of history behind it.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,frankiepop,3.3,"In the book of Frankiepop, the American classic Anchor is a tad overrated. However, Frankie likes a beer with a little more sweetness and dare I say, a little more flavor. True this special lager beer is nice beer. Easy to drink, a good summer choice, and with a refreshing twist of lemony citrus twang. So it is not an American crappy lager. No, Anchor is kind of creamy, kind of foamy, and kind of smooth. It's more of a bitter beer, a nice light hoppiness that makes IPA guys smile a little.  I on the otherhand found the taste a little weak. I prefer a Tecate, a Greek Marathon, or a European lager like Carlsberg. Anchor's summer citrus quality is nice. Very west coasty. Anyway, I'm saving the rest of the six pack for July! Still above average ratings though I will stick Anchor's wonderful Porter. Blow me down. Got to admit as it warms the more I drink the more I likey....  So pair this on a hot day with some nice traditional Jazz music. I might suggest a cd by Bucky Pizzarelli called Challis in Wonderland where this guitar phenom sits in with some wonderful arrangement with a small string section performing some old great jazz pieces arranged by Challis who worked with Bix Beiderbecke.

The head recedes to a thin soapy film, but never dissipates entirely, leaving a sticky bunch of lacing down the glass.  S - Mild overall, with caramel malt and crisp grassy hops coming through upfront. There's a touch of fruitiness as well, as well as some malty sweetness. Simple and balanced aroma.  T - Follows the nose, but still exceeds expectations. A nice base of toasty caramel malt, almost giving it an English feel, but the zesty hop profile pulls it back to America. Toffee-like sweetness to the malt, with lemongrass, clean barley malt, and a crisp citric character. The finish is punctuated with a mild grassy hop giving it a balanced feel overall. There's a mild fruitiness throughout as well that I can't quite put my finger on, though I'm almost positive I'm picking up some peach and apricot notes. Overall an immensely drinkable profile.  M - Medium bodied, with just the right viscosity, and a fine carbonation that compliments the body perfectly. Crisp and slightly dry, but somehow velvety smooth at the same time.

A bit macro smelling at first but changes to a nice caramel aroma as it warms. Nice caramel malty flavor perfectly balanced with hops. So easy to drink.

Auburn body with very high clarity. Sheets of thin lacing.  S- Caramel malts with a watery, muted smell.  T- Nothing like I've tasted before. Smoky, odd. Hard to describe.  M- Buttery and filling.

Taste is more of the same clean orangey marmalade malt characters. As it warms I get more of a hop bite.

Aroma: Extremely malty aroma of a standard brown or amber beer.  Taste: Malty taste. with a decent amount of flavor. Very pleasant and not offensive whatsoever. A refined Yuengling lager in my opinion.  Mouthfeel: Very crisp and refreshing. Not heavy in any aspect, yet also does not come off as watery. Very nice!  Overall: A fantastic session beer.

A perfectly crystal clear Amber-orange color. Very light beige head. Delicate floral and earthy aroma with a hint of fresh baked bread. Taste is bread crust, semi-sweet caramel, and a hint of floral/earthy hops, giving off a slight hint of a citrus character, as if a slight squeeze of lemon was put in every bottle.

Smell (3.0): Had to go average here because even with a vigorous poor there was not much of an aroma coming from the beer.  Taste (3.5): Somewhat bitter initial taste, with a nice malty after taste. Interesting.  Mouthfeel (4.0): Seemed light in the mouth, which to me kind of went with the ""steam"" idea.  Overall (3.5): It taste good, however it does seem to be lacking a bit.

28,63,boilermakerbrew,3.81,"A- Pours a medium amber color with a big, dense head. Head is very frothy and soft, with a slightly off white hue. Sticks around a good, long time and laces pretty well. Body is nearly completely clear with only the smallest bubbles and sediments visible.  S- Lots of light and adjunct-like aromas here. Light grain and light malts intermingle pretty well. More malt backbone than others in similar style. Malts give a hint of sweetness to go with the light grain. No hops detectable.  T- Pretty much the same as the smell. Would be a very forgettable flavor, but the quality of ingredients is much higher than similar tasting brews. Malt is persistent throughout, and the lighter, probably cereal, grains give a little balance. Hints of a little bit of fruitiness are also present. Very light in flavor, reminds me of a slightly more malty SA Light. Finishes with no aftertaste and the light grains chasing down your throat.  M- Here is where this beer shines in my opinion. The frothiness from the head sticks around a little and starts it with a silky soft beginning. Then the body of the beer provides a little carbonation, but much less than expected for the weight of this one. The malt and grain flavor provides a creamy smooth drink that might be a little more filling than others, but is still very sessionable.  Overall, this is a beer with ok flavors, but a great feel. It's a fairly simple beer, best used as an after work beer. If I had better access to this and the price was right, this would be a go-to beer in my fridge for an everyday alternative.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Some sweet and malty character as well  T-Really interesting, like crossing an APA with a helles lager. Citrus bitterness up front with a hefty toast malt character to balance. Minty floral finish.  M-Medium bodied, light carbonation. Medium dry and quite smooth.  O-Wow! This beer was a very pleasant surprise, had never thought this style sounded very appealing, but it was a wonderful session beer. Love the minty northern brewer hop character.

Taste is fresh and bright, citrus notes (without the hop explosion that I've come to associate with it.) Finish is zesty, with lemon grass and fresh herbs riding it out.

T: Similar to the nose with caramel sweet malts up front. An earthy, herbal bitterness rides the initial sweetness offering balance to the initial sugary onslaught. Puckering lemon and a spicy, almost peppery finish.  M: Smooth and substantial with very active carbonation which really adds to the palate.

28,63,rickyleepotts,2.39,"We only have a few more of these ""boring"" beers in the fridge… and then it's time to go shopping! That is my favorite part, buying new bottles to have in the fridge. Gives me something to look forward to. I like to let Sheryl pick a number to determine the beer we are going to drink. Let me tell you… the beer selection process is pretty crazy!  Anyway, tonight we are drinking a bottle of Anchor Steam Beer from the Anchor Brewing Company. Until tonight, I didn't realize that Anchor owned the trademark on the word ""steam"". I wonder how that works… I wonder what it costs to buy a trademark. Maybe I should trademark the word ""beer""… I'd make millions! Come on people, let's drink.  In the Glass: It has a nice copper color in the glass. It makes me think of those giant cider stills you see in breweries. I call them cider stills because I don't know the correct name for them… but they use them to make cider, I know that much. This beer also provides little head, and a weak lace.  Nose: The nose is pretty boring. Smells like a typical American lager, really. I wonder what makes this a ""steam beer""… I mean, I know what makes it a steam beer, but I have never heard of this style before. Maybe because Anchor owns the trademark to the word ""steam"".  Flavor: The flavor is unexpected. It has some subtle sweetness to it, but then the malts really hit. In the tasting notes they call the mouthfeel ""spritzy""… I call it carbonated. It's not overwhelming, though. Provides an easy drinking sensation that reminds me of a polished session beer.  Mouthfeel: There are a lot of bubbles going on here. Not too much, but enough that from my first drink I remember the carbonation.  Aftertaste: The aftertaste, what little aftertaste there is, has a certain malty sweetness to it. The tasting notes said it was lingering… but it's not. It's there and gone again. However, the sweetness stick around and begs for another sip.  Regardless of how they make this beer, I wouldn't consider buying this on a regular basis. I would simply grab a case on the way to the ballgame or pass it around in the parking lot while we tailgate. It's nothing to write home about. I will say, after sparking up a conversation with Anchor Brewing on Twitter, that their porter is one of the best porters on the market. But out of all the Anchor beers I have tried, most of them are middle of the road. Good thing they have that porter to keep me buying their product! Bottoms up, people.  Anchor Steam Beer - The bottle says: ""Anchor Steam brand beer is virtually handmade with an exceptional respect for the ancient art of brewing. The deep amber color, thick creamy head, and the rich flavor all testify to our traditional brewing methods. Anchor Steam Beer derives its unusual name from the 19th century when ""steam"" seems to have been a nickname for beer brewed on the West Coast of American under primitive conditions and without ice. The word ""steam"" may have referred to the pressure of nature carbonation developing in the beers. Today the brewing methods of those days are a mystery, and for many decades Anchor alone has used the quaint name ""steam"" for its unique beer. Today Anchor is one of the smallest and most traditional breweries in the world. San Francisco's famous Anchor Steam brand beer is unique, for our brewing process has evolved over many decades and is like no other in the world.""",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

The nose is really muted. And I mean muted to the point that I was sticking my face in the glass and couldn’t get much. I was really searching and got a slight hint of hops. The taste was boring at best. There was a crispness to it, which was the good part. Otherwise, I got some malt on it with a hint of hops. Wow this is just bland. It goes down easily but I think my qualm is more with the style. It’s just very boring to me. I could easily put a few back, but I really wouldn’t want to. Finish is quick and unremarkable.

I had this ages ago and remember enjoying it; the story of 19th century West coast brewing that underpins this beer is colourful.  Poured into a tulip pint glass. A deep orange-amber hue with faint haze and light carbonation. Yields a large head of creamy white foam that lasts for a few minutes before reducing to a surface layer. Aroma of caramel malt with earthy yeast esters and stewed hops. Faintly sweet. A hint of cardboard/sherry in the background, along with an alcoholic note.  Tastes of caramel malt with a dry finish. Notes of fruity, earthy yeast esters, stewed hops and a hint of solvent. Faint cardboard and sherry in the background. Dry, with a mild bitterness upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is smooth and tingly, with good body. Could perhaps be a tad more carbonated. Aftertaste of caramel malt and stewed hops.  It's an OK beer, though not amazing. From the stale background notes I'm wondering if this is old, though it's well within date. Decent malt character with an unusual yeast presence (like an English ale). No aromatic hops to be discerned. Goes down easily enough but just isn't that interesting.

S: Moderate citrus hops aroma, mainly lemony and a peach and orange-like ester are prominent in the aroma. There is a light biscuty and toasted malt aroma i the background.  T: the flavor is dominated by a moderate hop bitterness and a citrus hops flavor which is again mainly lemon like. There is a decent support from a biscuit and toasty malt flavor with the balance being moderately toward the bitter side. The cirtus hops flavor and bitterness linger a little past the dry finish.

Good lacing, though. Smell is a well-balanced malt and hop combo with sourdough and a nut note. Very nice. Taste is exactly what you would expect from the smell, malt, slightly evergreen hop note,sourdough bread and nuts. Great balance. Mostly full bodied, lightly effervescent, with a faint dryness to it.

Taste: Creamy, bready malt up front, then thinning a bit in the middle with some mild, prickly bitterness and just a hint of sourness. Finish is fairly fast and clean with some faint residual bitterness.  The Rest: A true classic.

T: Has an amazing taste... at first buttery, honey, fresh grapefruits and oranges, gingerbread. The best way to put it would be that this beer takes a taste intermission, because it takes a break before a mild hop flavour arrives at the end on the back palate.  M: Mouthfeel is really smooth, creamy, light bodied, with nice carbonation on the tip of the tongue. It dissipates evenly across the entire palate. Fills the whole mouth. Easy drinking beer.

Smells like a malty lager, alright, with very buttery, lightly toasted malts. Biscuits with butter, that's what I smell.  Taste is, hmm, dully refreshing. There's just not much to it. Those biscuity malts are present here, but less rich, and emptier in a way. Drifts into a mildly bitter finish that's only tolerable for me. Meh.  Mouthfeel is fine. Light-medium body, plenty of carbonation, and a long-lasting, fairly dry finish.  My first foray into the style, so I'm not sure if I'm undervaluing it. But I'm not particularly impressed.

28,63,Arno,4.45,"appearance: Bright orange. Lovely sugary broken white foam with great lacing.  smell: I get dark honey / nectar. Sweet grains and malts. Surprisingly i'm not getting much hop smell from it.  taste: It has a grainy dark honey sugary base flavor with some bittering hops through it to balance it out. The hops mellow out during the finish, leaving the lovely sweet malts and nectar like texture.  mouthfeel: Brilliant. Nectar like velvet. Syrupy. Very smooth and round. With some medium carbonation to freshen it up.  overall: It's not a very complex beer, but it does everything right. It's somehow quite sugary in texture, yet the hops gives it a nice light bitter kick.

28,63,TheRealBigC,4.45,"There is no beer in the world like Anchor Steam, and any attempt at making another steam beer has fallen well short of the high mark Anchor has set with this one. The California Common style is not one that will have any sort of worldwide presence, and you see on the style page how big of a gap there is in total reviews between Anchor Steam and whatever the #2 is. Anchor Steam is so unique and so good, that the style is basically named after it.  It's got a nice grainy smell. A powerful hop bitterness up front that mellows out with excellent malts and a mild fruitiness. That's the simplest way of explaining it, but really you won't have any idea what to expect. It's a beer in a league of its own. Maybe it's not for everyone, but everyone needs to try it.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Green apples, fresh bread, it does seem a bit restrained but draws you in. 3.5  Taste is slightly fruity with a good body of malt. Achieves a a nice balance with a bit of hoppy bitterness which resembles unripe green apples. On the finish it is slightly bready with a bit of yeasty character and a touch of sweetness. 4  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a sharpness from the carbonation. Quite full on the finish.

The beer is a clear amber color with a half finger of off white head that leaves a layer.  Smell: Mild and mild forward. Some dark fruit and mild caramel notes.  Taste: Less malt than in the smell but it is definitely still there. Some dark fruit notes with a bitterness in the finish. Quite light and refreshing in the heat.

The old Anchor was much ligher in color with a lower hop level and a yeasty character. Is it better? I'm not so sure, this beer kind of tastes like a hopped up amber ale without that character.

28,63,JamesMN,3.55,"Appearance: Semi-translucent copper color with an off-white sudsy head.  Aroma: A little bready and yeasty. Almost like a vienna lager with less malt. Fairly clean.  Taste: Like a Cream Ale with that lager component. Interesting bitterness on the tongue. The hops seem to be all bitter and no flavor. Tastes bottle conditioned which in this case isn't exactly a good thing.  Mouthfeel: Pretty thin and drinkable. Lots of carbonation.  Final Thoughts: This actually tastes like a hoppier version of the first home brew I ever made (Cream Ale) which makes it sort of unimpressive. However, it is a very cool hybrid of the ale and lager worlds and you can definitely taste both elements in here.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

There is some hop bitterness on the back end with some aftertaste. The flavors are well-balanced. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is smooth and dry.

Very clear red amber in color. Bubbles rise through the beer slowly.  Smell. A more pronounced version of the ""lager smell"". Predominantly fruity, but delicate, with a more pronounced dark berry and grape fruit aroma.  Taste. Starts out with the fruity grape like notes picked up in the nose. A grassy hop starts to fade in as the fruit fades out, and the bitterness comes to a climax with a slightly herbal quality to it. Next comes a full bready malt presence with a bit of the herbal quality remaining. The finish is dry, with a lingering bitterness.  Mouthfeel. Moderate body broken up by dense and tight carbonation. I would describe it as very mousse like.  Really a new experience for me. It really does skirt the line between lager and west coast style ale... leaning more toward the lager profile, both flavor wise and smell wise.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,leantom,4.32,"Decided to buy this beer after months of equivocating (poor college student - have to spend limited beer-money wisely), and boy am I glad that I did. Here's my review of Anchor Steam Beer.  A: Copper-colored with a thick, creamy head. The beer, although somewhat dark for a pale ale, is still very clear. I particularly liked the thick, creamy head (which was supported with lots of carbonation).  S: Very herbal and citrusy. However, I have to add a slight caveat for all the Advocates who like the over-hopped, Californian IPA's: This is not one of those over-hopped, overpowering IPA's that's loaded with northwestern Cascade hops. The citrusy and piney smells, while apparent, do not dominate the beer in a manner reminiscent of West Coast IPA's. The hops are perfectly balanced with the malt, much like imported English Pale Ales (this is great if you like British ales). It reminds me of Fuller's ESB.  T: Loved it. Very rich and creamy, however not overwhelmingly malty. No, in fact, the malt is balanced quite well with a leveled addition of piney, citrusy Cascade hops. This beer is a very well-balanced pale ale. There's also a lingering hop taste  M: Like the taste (i.e., very rich and creamy).  O: I liked this beer a lot. It's very reminiscent of Fuller's ESB. Try it with fish and chips (excess carbonation is good at cutting through oils and fats).",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

S-That Steam Beer aroma (which is quite yeasty) strikes first. Lightly floral and laced with honey. Light metallic aroma. Never brash or bold, but textbook and clean. Still, I don't love the nose.  T-Yeasty but the yeast is wearing a malty jacket. Sweet honey and uncooked dough. The hops are far from abrasive and stress a sublime array of flowers. Light metallic flavor puts an awkward tension on the entire taste.  M-Easy-going. Fuzzy carbonation. Sessionable. However, I feel that the body is considerably fuller than the ABV would suggest. A round feel.  O/D-How have I not rated this before? I am sure I have had it before but it slipped through the cracks. I truly am not a fan of the style. This is the Big Daddy of Common Beers.

Its glowing amber color and thick (!) foamy head provide a backdrop for a soothing upward cascade of bubbles from the bottom of the glass. The malty but crisp aroma presents a nice combination of bready sweetness and mossy bitterness. The flavor likewise exhibits good depth while still being quite drinkable. The must hop profile is more pronounced over the malty base, and there is some tangy yeastiness to add further complexity. The beer is substantial on the tongue but smooth, which once again makes this one flavorful yet drinkable.

S-Balanced between caramel malt and citrussy hops, yet the malt seems to slightly edge out the hop notes.  T-Near perfect balance between hops and malt. The hops supply a citrussy, yet grassy and slightly earthy flavor. The malt is slightly toasty with hints of caramel. I had guessed the hops were some kind of Noble hop due to the grassy favor I was picking up, but they use Northern Brewer. Regardless the flavor is very good.  M-Thick and creamy. Its a heavier beer.  D-The low abv. and great flavor make this one that you could enjoy many of during a single session. However, its a heavy beer which could possibly cut into the number consumed at one time.  Overall, this a true classic.

Carbonation is lively enough to keep things interesting. Great balance.  O: The microbrew industry has exploded in the past 15 years. And yet this consistently grabs my attention more than anything else on the market. So easy, so flavorful, so drinkable. I've drank this beer on the beach and paired it with Christmas cuisine. Not many beers can stand up to the task of being so delicious and so multi faceted. Love this stuff.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,Dave128,3.73,"*reviewed from notes* Poured from a 12 oz goofy looking bottle into an odd shaped pint glass at Sazerac restaurant in Seattle.  A - A light to moderate pour yields a 1 finger head that dissipates pretty quickly. Darkish amber in color. Lacing is low to non-existent. It gets some bonus points for the bottling though. I love Anchor bottles.  S - Nothing special on the nose. Light grainy smell. Cant detect any hops.  T - Similar to the nose, but there is something distinctive about this beer that I can't really but my finger on. I definitely like it.  M - Lightly carbonated and deliciously crisp.  O - This beer is a very drinkable beer that has some interesting qualities.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Some floral hop aromas comes through as well.  The taste is quite malty and has some caramel and biscuit. A moderate bitterness comes in about halfway through with some floral hop flavor. Finishes clean and slightly sticky.  Overall a solid beer but it seemed a little thin and lacking in flavor. I have had this on tap before and it was better. Might have to revisit this sometime.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Yeast flavor is mild and incredibly clean. M - Smooth and refreshing, with a medium-thin body and solid carbonation.

S: Pilsner malt, lager yeast, mild fruity yeast esters.  T: Lightly toasty bready malt, lager yeastiness with light generic fruitiness, and mild pine and grass hoppy bitterness in the finish.  M: Lighter body than it appears, good carbonation sensation, low alcohol presence.  O: This was an old standby for me back in the late '90s, and this was my first revisitation in a long time.

It smells very sweet, kind of roast almost from the malts, but you get that house hop aroma from their beers, which is pleasant.  It's very smooth, and follows just like the aroma. It's dry in a sense and makes you want to keep sipping, just like all of their beers. I'd buy this all the time a session able in the fridge.

Vigorous carbonation and a somewhat creamy mouthfeel are nice, but the taste is underwhelming. There's caramel malt and some wheat, a touch of hops... Tastes like beer. What else can I say? The balance isn't bad, but there's nothing in the flavor department that draws me in. The incredible rep that preceded this brew is a mystery to me, and I doubt that I could pick this out of a ineup of generic session beers.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Some bubbles can be seen drifting up to the top. A ring is left around the top of the beer with a little lacing noted during consumption.  There is a light caramel sweetness noted with a strong clean malt aroma. Grain and fresh grassy hops compliment.  Sweet malt and grassy hops form a flavor that seems a little simpler than the nose told of. There is a bitterness at the end that melds with a bready flavor to make the end very enjoyable.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and very singular. Carbonation is heavier than expected, and likely keeps the beer from bogging down, as I bet it would be much heavier if the carbonation were lighter. Slightly dry finish.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

A slight orange aroma mixed in with the hops. Very pleasant. Hops are balanced with a toasted malt aroma.  Starts thin and citrusy at entry. Hops come next, but it quickly rounds out to mostly malt at mid-palate and beyond. Hops leave a bitter aftertaste in the back of the throat. Carbonation levels are a little lower than I would prefer; the mouthfeel loses its prickliness too early.

Mouthfeel - Crisp and Refreshing. Body is light and the carbonation is fairly mild once you let it sit for a couple of minutes, and that makes it a very easy to drink!

Taste – A hoppy bite up front with some nice bitterness that then has a splash of lemon zest which fades almost immediately to grain malts and a caramel backbone. That’s about it…  Mouthfeel – Light bodied, plentiful carbonation, finishes quite crisp.  Overall – Paired with the chowder, this was a winner.

28,63,chinchill,3.98,"12 oz bottle served in a pint glass.  Pours a clear amber with an average white head that soon reduces to a lasting ring and leaves a modicum of lacing.  The light, earthy aroma is pleasing, but it is too mild to be very enticing.  The flavor (4.2) starts with a good hit of earthy/spicy hops, with the malt component becoming more apparent mid-taste. The hops are present all the way through, making this steam beer seeming to build in intensity through the finish. Great hops/malt balance leaves both bitter/sweet and other flavor components in exemplary balance. Excellent roster of malts.  Anchor Steam has a medium body; excellent carbonation, and a refreshing crispness.  O: excellent choice as a session beer or replacement for one of any light or macro-adjunct beer. Slightly milder than an average APA, but with as much flavor. Should work well with many lighter-flavored foods.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,longbongsilver,3.06,"In between home-brews at the moment and got curious about this style, having never had a steam beer before. Figure the most known would be a reasonable introduction. Pours a highly effervescent clear color somewhere between burnt orange and a very-very light brown-red, huge head pulls away from the mug to practically float in the beer. Last couple mm of the head are stubborn in an amusing way.  Clove-ish sting on the nose, with some bread, but otherwise very clean. Can't tell the hop character from smell alone. Let's swig...  Clove from the nose inches towards cinnamon on the taste, and the bready bit I assume from the yeast sticks up just a tad more than it suggested, though it doesn't show aggression in particular on any one component. A nutty character comes up as it warms. Odd as it sounds, I get a dryness in it I'd usually associate with cheap malt liquor, yet somehow here without the strength or the adjunct negatives.  Goes down simple and clean, no aftertaste. This is a chugger and quite proud of it.  On merits standing alone, it makes a nice utilitarian intro. On its tastes v. my usual tastes it diverges quite a bit, but man can't live on double stouts alone. I don't love it, but I understand it.  Now to attempt to make an imperial version...",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Aromas are very well blended, with a caramel malt presence and roasted characteristics. Flavors showcase a more tangy malt presence, with a good hops bitterness to balance from the background. The roasty character and the peppery spices from the hops are great accents to the malty backbone of the beer. Smooth bodied, with a crispness to the finish from the hops. The aftertaste is a good blend of the malt sweetness and the roasty notes. Very well balanced beer, and insanely easy to drink.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

M- medium bodied, low carbonation, velvety and smooth. Perfect.  This is a unique brew, very complex yet everything balances nicely.

It would also be on my short list for introducing newcomers to good beer. (And the Anchor Steam story is good for that, too.)  Why do I like it so much? I'm not sure... it's kind of a ""sleeper beer"" ... it's not exciting or especially bold, but the flavor profile, mouthfeel, and whole experience is so enjoyable and satisfying I am never disappointed.  The big thing for me is the taste. There's something so wonderfully balanced about Anchor Steam. It's malty, toasty, caramelly, with these flavors that are reminiscent of a darker beer, but it also has these brighter citrusey and fruity characteristics that poke out now and again. Those notes mostly just brighten up the flavor, but every once and a while it grabs you in a different way. It's well carbonated, not in an aggressive way, but in a way that makes your mouth happy.

I also enjoyed the back story on the bottle's label of how it was called ""Steam Beer"".  Taste and mouthfeel were well above average and it had a nice front with what tastes like caramel malt and then finishes with a subtle hop bitterness. After drinking it the hop flavor stays with you for a bit but not excessive.  Seen it in the store and was intrigued by the name, so i bought it.

T: This is where I was shocked and disappointed, up to this point it seemed like a promising beer. Heavy malts. Extremely bitter, almost metallic.

Tasted incredibly bitter and not refreshing at all. I would put it on par with Bud/Miller but not as neutral.

Anchor Brewing was purchased in the 1975 by Fritz Maytag, and helped revitalize regional brewing in the US, a precursor to the craft explosion we get to enjoy today. Anchor's flagship brew is Anchor Steam, which falls into the California Common style category, a hybrid by the use of lager yeast at warmer then usual temperatures. This beer pours slightly orange with flashes of amber, a frothy head that provides good lacing throughout. Bready malty tones are first observed, with slight yeastiness poking through as the beer warms, simple and pleasant. Again the bready malt meets with hints of yeasty flavors, while the brew shows a moderate level of bitterness, slight citrus notes from the hops that all lead into a clean, crisp finish. A light to medium body is met with a good level of carbonation. A GREAT example of this style.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Heavenisbeer,3.06,"A: The highlight of the beer. Amber in color, nice fluffy white head with decent retention and a little lacing.  S: Sweet bready malts. Very light though.  T: Watered down sweet bready malts, with a soapy metallic finish. Bleh.  M: Light to medium body, with some prickly carb and a tinny finish.  I really don't get why this beer is hyped. Every time I come back to it, I'm left underwhelmed.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,ONUMello,3.73,"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass A: Orange color; very thin head S: Caramel, grass and yeast. I'm not picking up any hops. Fairly light overall. T: Crisp and bitter up front, then leads to grass & sulfur. Simple yet complex at the same time if that can happen. M: Medium-bodied, extremely crisp. O: Very refreshing. Classic style. I will definitely try more during the summer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,TheCondor,3.53,"I picked this beer up in a mix and match six pack at the local Hy Vee, having never heard of it or read anything about it. Basically I liked the label, so I grabbed it!  Appearance - As unusual as this sounds, I'd say it came out a sort of cross between gold and amber in color. Good transparency, and even though I botched the pour a little because the kids were acting up, it had a nice thick, creamy, probably two finger head on it with moderate lacing.  Smell - Not real overwhelming, although I could certainly pull the yeast out of the nose. Very light smell overall. Not bad, just light.  Taste - All that being said, the brew was suprisingly refreshing and tasted great! Maybe a slight hint of caramel, malty, just a tad bitter. I thought it was an excellent tasting beer.  Mouthfeel - Very crisp and smooth, went down real easy. With all the taste this beer has, it goes down so smooth, kinda makes you want to drink another!  Overall - Having known nothing about this beer before I bought it, I'd say it was a pretty good beer. The California Common/Steam Beer genre may not necessarily be my cup o' tea, but this is a tasty and refreshing beer nonetheless, one that I would certainly recommend for both an experienced craft brew drinker or a relative newcomer alike.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,beerdrinker123,3.67,"This beer pours a clear golden orange color with a small amount of foamy white head that leaves a tiny bit of lacing on the glass.  Smell wise its got a sweet caramelly start with a bready malt finish no hops at all.  Flavor wise its a little more of the same, the semi sweet toffee/caramel notes are a nice foundation, not hoppy at all, not much malt character either though.  Its got a little more carbonation that I like, just the right viscosity. Definitely a session beer, could easily put a couple of these down without getting tired of them.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

O-This was one of the first ""good"" beers I had every had way back in the day. I think I am likely not along in that. This beer style made ""california common"" a house hold name due to the fact that no one else is allowed to claim steam beer. Although not overly complex, I appreciate this beer for what it is an amazing drinkable beer, a timeless classic, a craft beer when no one knew what that meant.

28,63,sabinelr,4.28,"This is a pioneer that helped to fire off the craft beer revolution. I used to buy this at the Food Giant in Wallingford, and always looked forward to the nice bitterness and flavor that put it in a different class from the commonly available beers. I haven't had any in years, so when I got a bottle as a gift, I was looking forward to a good nostalgic taste, and I am not disappointed. I could drink this all night while watching good movies or cartoons, and know that the evening was well spent. For you folks that want to look into the world of alternative beer, this is just about the best place to start. Decent bitterness without a strong skunky malt smell or flavor, and one swig leaves you wishing for another.

T- Carmelly lager taste.  M- Smooth and delicious.  I've had a few different breweries version of this beer ""Steam"" or ""california common"" as some call it.

A: Pours a murky copper color, with a large, sexy four-finger off-white head that fades away at a moderate pace.  S: Mostly earthy aromatic hops, but also features a small bready scent, as well.  T: The opening is malty, biscuity, and almost sweet, while it finishes with a decent hit of grassy, floral hops. Flavorful and refreshing, but I imagine it would be better suited to the summer months.  M: Finishes very wet, and has moderately high carbonation overall. Nice smoothness, too.  O: This is pretty damn good, and like many of the well-known craft beers (SN Pale Ale, SA Boston Lager), has a good degree of versatility, as well.

28,63,musicman575,3.45,"Anchor Steam is very flavorful and effervescent light bodied beer. You get a lot of bang for your buck.  I am suprised by the pleasant nose. It's yeasty and spicy, almost belgian, with floral hoppiness.  It's a completely different beer than what the smell suggests. The malt is definitely the most salient flavor - semi-sweet and very bready, almost musty. The hops are also pretty prominent and intertwoven with the other flavors. They're present from start to end. Finishes dry with a grainy, slightly bitter aftertaste.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Wood, flowers, even a little bit smokey. It smells clean. It smells like something you want to taste.  T: Smooth, cultured, somewhat (but not overly complex). A few strong tones stand out amongst the many layers: Sweet and salty.  M: Smooth. A little creamy. A little crisp. This beer adapts to the mood and setting.  Overall: Perhaps one of the best easily obtainable beers. When it's time to splurge (money-wise) a little, Anchor Steam is always considered.

Shorty poured into a pint glass.  a-When i first looked this a few years ago i thought to myself wow this looks just like a lager. not much head the same straw colored clearness. boy was i wrong  s-the smell is where you start to notice. It smells like the crispness of a lager but there are the subtle fruity undertones there that make you start doubting  t-bam this is something else. You get hit right away at first with some sweetness on the front but it quickly moves away for that signature smooth lager finish  m-solid through and through.

Poured form the unique fat/stubby 12oz brown Anchor bottle into a shaker pint glass.  A= This beer poured a slightly hazed orange/copper color with a fairly thin 3/8"" rocky off white head. Tons of lingering carbonation release. Not much in the way of head retention or lace.  S= Almost a lager-like malt sweetness in the nose, followed by a rustic earthy/woody hop note.  T= Completely mimics the nose. Malty sweetness, including some light caramel notes, lead into a blast of hops. Bitterness was firm, and the hop flavor was earthy and dank with hints of citrus and to a lesser extent pine. Finished dry and puckering.

28,63,TobiasGoth,3.45,"Appearance A clear and effervescent amber/light brown with traces of blood red in it. One finger off-white head. A fizzy but fast settling beer.  Smell Loads of rich malt, then some light and elegant hops, followed by limey sensation. It’s a sweet and sour story really.  Taste Sweet malts firstly, bitter and astringent secondly. There’s a note of orange seeds too.  Mouthfeel A light to medium corpus, balanced and normal amount of carbon dioxide, very much a presence though. A buttery smooth liquid.  Known as a California Common, with it’s characteristic Norther Brewer hops, Anchor Steam Beer is Anchor Brewing Company’s flagship product.  I remember enjoying my very first bottle during the summer of 2002 at Fisherman’s Wharf, travelling through the state of California. There was a big old sea gull sitting next to me, watching as I drank the brew.

Overall Drinkability - This is the grandaddy of Steam Beers, so it almost can't get a bad grade here since I'm rating by style. It's somewhat enjoyable but despite even my infatuation with the city of San Francisco, I cannot convince myself to say this is a particularly good beer. Good in style, perhaps, but overall I don't find it all that special. Except for the fact that I first had this beer on my honeymoon in SF.

Slight bitterness from the hops as well.  M - Medium body with decent carbonation, nice and crisp.  O - A pretty decent beer, which one would expect from a signature beer like this.

There is significant hop, citrus, malt, and caramel flavors present in this beer and the do a good job at balancing each other out.  M: The mouthfeel is good.

T: Light, bready malts with a fresh grain undertone and a burst of fresh, lightly sweet fruitiness. Spicy and citric hops mingle with biscuity malts towards the swallow. Mild, rather ale-like yeastiness throughout.  M: Medium-to-light-bodied; it's tricky to judge due to the high, lively, yet smooth carbonation.

This is a good thing for me since I enjoy the Hefeweizen style. I just wasn't expecting banana in this ""steam"" beer. No booziness at all. I can tell already this is going to be a good session beer.  Taste: Again, light caramel, malt and mild citrus hops.

28,63,ChrisCage,4.53,"A- This brew has a very nice golden color, that is ever so slightly chill hazed. The head is impressive at first, taking up a good third of my beer glass, but I have to note that it really settles quickly....it does finally settle down to a thick film over the brew. Lacing appears to be excellent, as there is a great deal of small patchy foam clinging to my glass. Carbonation appears to be mild and fine looking...a very decent looking beer!  S- There is a medley of aromas going on here...I detect a good strong malt presence, along with some Earthy spice, some floral notes as well as some fruit...almost a blend of banana and citrus zest. The finish is of fresh hop bitterness. Very nice smelling!  T- Following the aromas quite closely, this is a very flavorful beer. The malt beginnings give way to some banana fruit, especially after it warms a bit, as well as some caramel/toffee notes. The finish is pleasantly fresh and shows some great bittering hop presence! A very nicely balanced beer from start to finish!  M- While this is still a light bodied beer in my opinion, it leans towards medium. The carbonation, while plentiful, is finely tuned and doesn't take away from anything. This is a very refreshing, flavorful brew overall!  O- I can't recall ever having Anchor Steam prior to this review, which surprised me, but regardless, this is a very enjoyable beer, which I will be sure to pick up again in the future. It's very well rounded beer and probably one of the tastiest lagers a person will find. It has shades of an English Ale, which is what I think is drawing me to it so well.

M: Very smooth, light to medium body  O: This beer had fantastic balance and I could see myself drinking this at any bbq anytime ever. Tasty!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Holland,3.76,"A: pours a clear orangish amber color with a one finger head. Full of fizz, this keeps its head for a while, but the bubbles are gigantic and leave a froth.  S: smells of malt, alcohol, slight fruity or sourness. I'm put off a bit by the alcohol, especially at less than 5% ABV.  T: tastes of malt, fruity/sourness, some bitterness. Interesting and more complex than I had figured.  M: smoother than the carbonation level indicates, but it does have a crisp feeling for a while. Nice feeling, great summer beer.  O: cool style, I've never had it before. I love a complex lager, and the yeast gives some itneresting flavor. This is available all over and fairly delicious - recommended as a gateway beer at the very least.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Flux,4.47,"straight from fridge, poured into a pint glass.  A- Deep amber with no haze. White foamy head that eventually dissipates but lacing persists.  S- caramel malts and hops. Toasty. Mild bread smell.  T- Sweet malts are upfront and the bittering hops come through at the end. Notes of bread crust is detectable.  M- Medium to high carbonation, full bodied but still makes for an easy session beer.  Overall a really great flavorful beer.

Being a huge fan of their porter and Humming Ale, I was very excited to try the Stream right where it's made: San Francisco.  Pours a bright, sunny orange with a nice foamy head.

28,63,BarryMFBurton,3.61,"Alright…I’m not quite sure what a California Common is, but I know that Anchor Steam is the model for the style. The label says “deep amber color, thick creamy head, and rich flavor,” so I feel like this is something I’d enjoy – I like all of those things!  A: Awesome shine; deep amber is right. And the head really is thick and creamy – there’s sticky white lacing everywhere. So far, their assessment of the beer is accurate. Let’s check out this nose…  S: It’s bright, that’s for sure; mostly in a light macro-wheat taste. Sort of skunky, with just a hint of natural fruitiness. There’s some creamy malts there, too, coming off in a sugary amber way; banana, baked breads, and a bit of cinnamon-sugar. Pretty mild; pretty average.  T: Upon first taste, it comes off as yet another macro-lager: lacklust wheats and yeast. It’s definitely growing on me after a few sips in, though. The hops start to come out, thankfully, with a lemony tang – not as big as a pale ale, but good and bitter. Malts and yeast are like the nose: banana bread and the slightest hint of dark sugars. Aftertaste is bready, showing some slight smoked bitters. A balanced, decently interesting palate.  M: Very light – the body’s gone as soon as you let it sit for a second. Smooth, and just a tad bubbly.  O: A unique American lager. I’m really glad to see our country representing in the lager game, especially with a style all our own. Lager doesn’t mean “boring beer;” in fact, some of my absolute favorite beers are lagers (mostly German, though). Nice going, Anchor Steam – gotta love good beer with good history.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

S - Citrus hops balanced by a sweet, clean malty aroma. Quite mild.  T - Rather muddy. Tangy citrus notes and subtle bread notes. Disappointing, really.  M - Dry and highly carbonated. Doesn't do any flavors justice either.  D - As the prototype common/steam beer, I was pretty disappointed.

(S) Smells of sweet, lightly toasted malts. Has a good amount of citric fruits dominated by orange and lemon peel. Has that fresh acidic zest smell to it.  (T) A lot of orange peel and lemon zest along with some cereal and bread. The hops are present in the aftertaste and give a nice overtone to the decent malts that lay the foundation. Has a bit of sweetness with a hint of grapefruit and...ginger? A hint of ginger perhaps.  (M) Crisp, medium body. Slight bitterness and slight zest from the carbonation.

Sturdy malt forms the base with a smooth, bread-like character. Hint of rye. Reasonable amount of hops in the mix, providing a mildly bitter, herbal bite. Ginger? Smooth in the middle with a dry, crisp finish.  Lighter bodied with a crisp feel. Carbonation compliments the flavor perfectly.  This is some solid stuff.

T - Bready yeast/malts with some slight caramel flavoring and a nice kick of hops that I didn't quite expect. There's also a very nice nutty flavor as the beer warms. Fairly simple yet complex in a way I can't quite describe.  M - Thin to medium bodied, very crisp. Finish is that kick of bitter hops followed by a nice sweet aftertaste that stays around for quite a while.

28,63,flyingpig,3.77,"An orange amber colour that is slightly darker in places & settles with a thin white, bubbly head with average retention.  Strong hop aroma with some nice herbal notes & a little spiciness too. The later part is similar but with more of a citrus & pine presence. Well balanced.  A lot a pine in the flavour that is blended together nicely with some good citrus flavours & just a hint of sweetness. Along with the initial bitter hops their is a background herbal & grassy hops taste & a semi bitter, hop infused semi-bitter one.  Very smooth to drink & highly drinkable as a direct result of this. The beer is a medium bodied one & the carbonation is about right for the type of beer.  Overall this one was great with a beautiful bitter hop flavour that was very well balanced & went down great.

28,63,augustgarage,4,"Poured from two 12oz bottles into my Moonlight shaped pint glass.  Brilliantly clear safety orange liquid is capped by a half finger of active seashell foam, fed by a fury of rising micro-bubbles. Decent lacing and retention.  Faintly sweet caramel notes in the nose along with lightly toasted pale malt. Herbal notes hint at sage and wet wood.  Malty palate entry with a grassy hop note for contrast. Grainy/tangy finish vaguely suggesting triticale, oats, with hints of bitter melon. Clean and medium-dry overall. Lager-ish...  Light-bodied, well carbonated, and just slightly creamy mouthfeel.  Defines the style, so rating to style is almost redundant. Uniquely crafted session-able ale that immediately brings to mind foggy Summer mornings in The City.

A slightly bitter dry finish. Very nice....  M) This is crisp and clean. The body is medium/light, with decent carbonation. This is smooth and has a good finish.

After hearing him speak about the beer I had to give it another try.  It's better than I remember. There's a nice malt taste and light hop flavor, though not overly bitter.  This beer is often priced in the $13.50 range for a six pack in the NY area but if you do some looking you can find it for $11.99 some places.

Decent head, two fingers of thick bubbles. Head dissipates pretty fast leaving nice lacing on the glass.  Aroma is faint- I get some malt/bread. Light citrus.  Taste is a nice blend of malt and hops-maltiness is a bit more pronounced, but the hop bite is there in the finish.

Nose is gentle but nice, slightly citric and fruity hops on top of a light grainy malt base. A little earthy, almost cocoa powder character underneath. Sweet on the whole.  Suprising on the palate, with chocolate-covered oranges and an earthy, somewhat tannic dark fruit character. Fruit blend flavor includes a muddled earthy-but-tart raspberry note, and subtle lime. Finishes with a dry yeasty twang.  Fullish in body, quite well carbonated, somewhat scrubbing. It's been perhaps four years since I first had Anchor Steam, and I had no real memory of this beer.

Medium bodies and very lush and creamy. The highlight of this beer for sure. A real pleasure to drink.  This beer just hit all the right buttons for me tonight. Having previously enjoyed this on many occasions, I have tended to overlook this as it's readily available in a world of the elusive hunt and desire to seek out more limited or exciting beers.

Taste:Caramel up front (just a hint of sweetness, not overpowering), followed by well balanced hops that lead to a nice crisp finish.  Mouthfeel: Silky smooth, perfectly carbonated, crisp (yet not drying) finish on the mouth. A genuine pleasure to drink.

S: Some citrus followed by some spiciness, the hops really dominate the late half of the nose.  T: Pretty darn good, follows the nose for the most part. Starts off with a bit of citrus that lingers until the back half. You also get some nice hop bite at the beginning that turns spicy towards the middle and finishes out the sip.

28,63,TheBrewo,3.21,"This brew was served to us from draught at The Distillery in Victor, NY. It arrived in a pint glass and shone a pale golden nut brown color. It held a one finger creamy white head that retained decently, to leave bits of lacing around the glass. There was minimal haze, with no sediment, and a light carbonation noted. The aroma was of sweeter grain. This hid a mild fruitiness, and a rather pronounced licorice note. This sweetness was enhanced by faint esters. Finally, on the back, there was a tomato acidity, acetylaldehyde, and a white wine vinegar to cut the original dextrins. As we sipped, we began with grains and a licorice flavoring, as was present in the nose. This was sickly sweet for a start. The middle exhibited a huge grainy quality, with much of it coming across as cheap-beery adjuncts. Here, too, there was cooling vanilla, and mild phenolic esters. This helped smooth the transition to a bitter end, given by grain and black pepper burns of alcohol. The aftertaste breathed of the malt bill, bitter booze, light bananas, and a spice of booze. The body was medium and the carbonation was medium. The feel was quite hollow, with a steely dryness to it. With each sip came a stickiness, but again, this faded into a drying coininess. The abv was appropriate and the beer drank as more of a sipper, due to the contrast between bitter and sickly sweet throughout the tasting.  Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the look. The coloring was deep, rich, and dark, with a nice frame of a head. Where we lost points was in the adjuncty grain through the middle, which became harsh at times. Despite this, the licorice vibe as a primary source of sweetness was something that kept the drinker interested, and coming back for more.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

There is a strong malt sweetness and a light amount of hops and bit of spice. Upon warming a bit of grainy malt begins to come forward.  T: The taste is similar to the aroma, rather biscuity mixed with some sweetness. There is some light fruit and a little bit of spice and a slightly bittersweet finish.

The beer is a hazy, orange color. I don't see any particulates, but the coloration would indicate the presence of some matter for the hazyness.  This Steam smells like apricots and floral.

Throughout the taste there is a dry sweetness that is enjoyable and not too overwhelming. Despite the lack of carbonation in looks, it has a very pleasant bubbly feel on the tongue, that again has a bit of a zang.  Overall- It was a good beer, not great, but good. The beer has a great balance. The sweetness is very consistent throughout the taste and provides a nice balance with that fruity ""zing"". Adding to the balance, the bitterness is more than I was expecting (in a good way). Because it has decent flavors, I may buy again if it went on sale.

28,63,Pintofbrown,3.73,"Appearance: Pours with much fizzing and crackling thanks to the healthy amount of carbonation in the beer. The head grows with a heavy tumbling of bubbles under the surface and the stiff head grows to three fingers.  The head falls to about one finger of egg - white foam, still very thick, leaving behind a sticky lace. It’s a bright amber color with golden highlights. Healthy pillars of carbonation escaping to the top. Great!  Smell: The mild fruitiness is definitely there, stewed dark berries with wheat. The hop bitterness of the beer is also present in the sniffs taken. The wheat barley provides the hearty back bone. Everything so far has been a great build up to the drink.  Taste: The flavor profile is very robust. The malt is balanced well with the hops in the beer. In fact, the malt is at the forefront of the sip and provides a wheat and slightly fruity flavor, black berries and raspberries. But as soon as it’s there the hop bitterness finishes the drink and provides a second shot of the barley wheat in the finish.  The flavors do not stick around long; have to take a quick second drink to keep the taste profile going. I wish that the malt and fruity flavors from the nose stuck around to the finish, and didn’t give way to the wheat flavor.  There’s an unbecoming cereal, wheat flavor that shows in the finish when the beer warms. That bit of the beer, at least, was disappointing.  Mouth feel: The malt and hops are balanced on a tight rope, making for a refreshing and rewarding finish. It is a fine crafted beer, and thus, a mouth feel like one would imagine: medium bodied, and smooth.  Overall: The beer looks and smells great. Once you taste it, some of that luster is taken away, but it is still a solid beer. It’s very refreshing, and what I think a good beer with this barley wheat back bone should taste like.  Make sure you drink this thing at a lower temperature, warming really doesn’t do it any favors.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Very aromatic, with smells of crisp lemon and light wheat malts coming up to the nose. Maybe a touch of orange. Very pleasant.  The taste is unique in its blend of bitterness and maltiness. The bitterness is quick and clean, but gritty in the end. The wheat malts come in and fill in the cracks, making the taste very full. The bitterness is sharp and poignent, leaving a very dry finish and a slightly bitter aftertaste. There is a lemon rind zest that brings the flavor full-circle and gives the beer its character. All the flavors are right on, but somehow the mouthfeel seems slightly too carbonated, making it fizzy in the mouth. The other aspects of the mouthfeel are dead on though, perfectly dry and crisp.  This is one of those beers that other beers of this style get compared too. I really enjoy this one and will always take one if offered, and will still buy on occasion.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,jayhawk73,3.35,"A- Pours a copper color, w/ an off white head. Average carbonation and lacing.  S- Malt, grain, slight fruit... Fairly weak, I'd like the nose to be a little stronger, even for the style.  T- Same general profile as the smell. Not bad for the style, but not exactly great either, thus the score. Some yeast in the taste as well.  M- Fairly malty w/ a bitter tinge to it. Full bodied for the style.  O- Not crazy about this one, but it's better than BMC products. Not recommended at this time.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,twoheadedboy,4.05,"Poured a beautiful light amber color. Smell is incredibly sweet; malts, caramel and strong honey. Taste is extremely light, smooth and sweet with some balancing hop citrus zest and bitterness. An incredibly unique beer, as well as incredibly refreshing. There's a good reason why it's been such an influential, pioneering brew.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,DrewSnyc667,3.45,"On tap in a 16 oz shaker pint  A - Deep copper color. Small head that is non existent very early into the beer. Very little activity  S - Robust malt up front, caramel, sugar, plum. Slight acidity in the back  T - Surprisingly light. The nose gets you ready for a heavy, malty brew but the hops are really prevalent and snap the beer to a nice clean finish  M - Could use some more bubbles, leaves enough of noticeable alcoholic finish that is less than desirable  O - Not a bad brew at all, very similar to an amber lager. With that being said not my first choice in the variety, but a craft classic and worth a a try.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,bluemoonswoon,3.38,"How on earth have I avoided reviewing this beer for so long? 22oz bottle poured into a tulip glass.  Color is fantastic, clearish honey and maple, but the head retention leaves something to be desired and this glass ain't dirty.  Aroma is muted, a bit nutty, kind of an English Pale Ale thing going on. Hop bitterness is really only apparent in the finish, flavors really don't exist in the traditional sense of the word, just more of an overall sort of feeling.  A true classic, a proto-craft beer if you will and really something worth revisiting after a long absence or a couple of times a week for sipping, either way you are in good company with this beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,DavidST,4,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Review from notes:  Pours an amber color with a large off white head which has great retention. Smell is of bready / bisquity malts with a little hops. Feel is medium to light. The taste is pretty good, you get the wave of bisquit / bready matls up front with some hop bitterness at the end, its followed by a weird lingering after taste which is hard to describe, perhaps metallic. Overall this is a pretty tasty beer and one I'll get again.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Jaynuze,3.98,"A: Pours well. Nice light amber, good sign of great malts S: Not as malty as I'd like, but still a solid nose with light notes of biscuit, bread, and very light florals T: Very light, with some roasted malt/biscuit flavors. Hopped just enough to round the finish on the palette. M: Solid mouthfeel: well carbonated, thick but light, and very well rounded with a nice pairing between the roasted malt and hops O: Just a great all around beer. It's one of the standard ""go to"" brews in our fridge. A solid example of the quality that comes from Anchor. Love this beer",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,blincoln,3.96,"Appearance: Dark copper with half finger of head. Settles quickly to a thin coating of bubbling foam and almost no lacing.  Aroma: Very subtle smell. Hints of malts and fruits.  Taste: The subtle smells come through in the taste giving you a colorful blend of malts (almost sweet like caramel), grains, and a touch of hops. Slightly bitter and yeasty as it warms and finishes.  Palette: High carbonation (this one had me burping). Not too heavy making it an easy beer to drink. Somewhat dry.  Overall: A great simple beer. Crisp, clean, and easy to enjoy…just like us Californians.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,notchucknorris,4.15,A: Pours a coppery color with a thin white head.  S: The smell is malt dominated with a touch of earthy hops.  T: There was actually a lot more to this beer than I expected to find. Smooth malts at first followed by some earthy hops and bready malts on the finish. There's a nice bitterness that you're left with on the finish that definitely keeps you coming back.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,magictacosinus,4.33,"Oh man, Anchor Steam. I've probably lost count on how many times I've had this. For this review, I poured it into a pint glass - bottle had no freshness date.  Appearance: A bold amber color with a small lacy head that maintains throughout. Carbonation, as expected, is highly present. If this beer was less clear in appearance, you could easily mistake it for an amber ale.  Smell: A combination of a fruity, yeasty smell with noticeable biscuit aromas. The citrus hops tingle the nose. It may be a simple smell, but it's enjoyable.  Taste: This is where the greatest aspect of this beer lies! There's nothing but warm, flavorful malts to enjoy here. It also holds an extremely tasty fruity smell reminiscent of, but not limited to, berries and limes. In this case, the hops serve the malts, but that is no problem at all.  Mouthfeel: Due to the maltiness of this beer, it allows itself to be a creamy and warming beverage to drink. There is a slight bitter aftertaste due to the hops, but nothing too noticeable. As it's quite thick in feel, I'm still stunned every time I crack open one of these and remember that it's not an ale.  Overall: A true standout classic amongst craft brewing. As an SF resident, I'm quite proud to call this our iconic flagship beer. I always take this over a pale ale any day due to its unique fruity and malty flavor!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Smell: Malty, caramel  Mouthfeel: medium; really coats the tongue; good carbonation  Taste: The malt drops anchor here, especially after about a five minute sitting.  Overall: I'd tried this one years ago and forgot the taste, but BA got me curious. What a nice surprise! I'd drink this one on a regular basis. Can't wait to try Anchor's Liberty Ale.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Creamy and well carbonated, full malt body with a nice amber malt taste and a slight hoppy bitterness.

Bit of hoppiness, yeastiness. Has some spiciness in there. Good, easy drinkin taste. Light citrusy flavors too.  Mouthfeel is smooth, you can feel the small bubbled carbonation. Light medium body.  Good solid beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,awmiller,4,"Now this is one jim-dandy of a brew! This brew poured up a hazy copper-colored body with a wonderfully thick, off-white colored head with good retention and lacing effects on the glass. Aromas of malts, caramel, citrus fruits (lemons, and maybe some orange). Flavors of the same in a malty concoction that beckons you to take the next sip just as soon as you finish one. Medium-bodied, full-flavored with a dry finish and citrusy aftertaste.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,evlu1441,4.07,"This is my first encounter with ""Steam Beer""... Should be interesting. I like the short rounded bottles!  It pours a medium coppery amber colour. There is a thin bubbly head. It is quite transparent.  The aroma is warm and malty with some nice aromatic hoppyness. This combines to create a bit of a sweet and spicy smell.  This is quite a hoppy beer! Slightly sweet a to start, but the hop bitterness cuts through quite quickly. This then gives way to some biscuity malt flavour.  Overall, this is a very interesting type of lager. I'd certainly drink it again. It has the hoppiness that I like from pale ales with the nice malty flavours and crispness of a good lager.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,avaldivia,4.35,"Let me start this review by saying that I am giving this beer an A+, not because I think it is the best beer around but because it is the best beer in this style. Compared to other California Commons, it is king.  A: Nice hazzy golden color. Thick head that leaves great lacing  S: Nice bit of yeast funk and a really good hoppy note. Some dark fruit.  T: Good hop citrus note to start. Nice bready biscuity malt flavor. Bit of funk and fruit flavors.  M: Thick full bodied. Very well carbonated. Perfect.

A thin head formed at the top of the poor with very minor lacing on the sides of the glass.  S: Biscuity malts dominate the nose with some slight spice and fruit flavors as well.  T: Sweet malts hit the tongue at the onset of the sip. Some molasses and slight mango and banana are present in the middle followed by a smooth bitterness in the finish.  M: Light to medium bodied with good carbonation.  Overall, this is a good beer. The flavor profile is balanced and fairly complex. This is an enjoyable steam lager from the brewery that pioneered the style.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Some fresh hop scents but very faint  Taste - Quite refreshing. Light on the pallet and well balanced. No real pronounced flavors here, just an easy drinker that is smooth up front and crisp on the finish.  Very pleasant mouthfeel as its not fizzy in the mouth and feels full bodied despite the light APV  Overall - THis is a good beer to drink in summer or to have on tap while enjoying some of your favorite seafood at a raw bar. Light and refreshing, nothing overpowering.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,JoeBCBC,3.59,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass.  A- Pours a nice golden amber with a thick two finger white foamy head. Anxious to drink this.  S- Getting a lot of bready malt and the esters created by the lager yeast fermented at warm temps. Not too bad, but a little bland.  T- Tasting a lot of malt, the lager yeast, and a tinge of bitterness and herbal-ness from the hops that kind of seems out of place. Not too bad though.  M- The mouthfeel is definitely right. Perfect carbonation and body to this beer to make it enjoyable and very drinkable.  O- I know this beer is very popular, and being a brewer, it is interesting to read about the techniques used in making this beer. However, this one just doesn't do it for me. Not a bad beer, but not one I would go out of my way to have again. I haven't had many Cal.

28,63,WoodBrew,3.76,It has been a while since I drank an Anchor Steam...I forgot how good it is! The color is a rich amber and clear. Decent white head that laced pretty well. There was not much to smell other than hints of malt and bread. The taste was good....definite malt base that was balanced neatly with hops. The beer had some body but was still light on the pallet. Mouthfeel was great...very easy to drink and had anice clean finish.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Jwale73,3.58,"12oz. bottle served in an American Pint at 53 degrees. Batch# 1YF indicated on the back label. Pours a translucent burnt-orange with a dense, 2.5 inch cream-colored head. Head eventually settles into a solid quarter inch cap, with some residual spots of lacing revealed as the brew recedes. Nose reveals noble hops aromatics and light, toasted malts. Taste follows nose - hops presence is not overpowering, but overwhelms the malt profile. There's also a faint citrus quality interspersed across the backbone and finish is not really bitter, but there is a slight floral/earthy character that lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively carbonation and just a kiss of acidity. I can't say that I've had many opportunities to try this style out, but I was a bit underwhelmed. I can see it pairing well with food, but there are other brews I would go to before seeking this one out again.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,DabblinWiscCraft,3.86,"Handed off to me with a nice 1/2 inch, cream-colored head with decent cling as it falls. A very clear medium copper-amber without much noticeable carbonation. A malty nose, with some burnt notes coming through, along with a bit of sourness and faint iron. Not a strong smell at all. The taste is very smooth and creamy at the fore, with malts mingling with some bright hop notes. Very balanced. The close is punctuated by hop bitterness that lingers for just the right amount of time. With that acidity, if finishes much crisper than it begins. The feel is, again, creamy and medium-bodied, with very pleasant zest at the close. Nice complexity and balance here.  This is just a very drinkable beer. There aren't a lot of prominent flavors that confront the palate, but it goes down so nicely. Smooth when it should be smooth, and crisp when it should be crisp. Just wish it wasn't so cost prohibitive for me to enjoy it regularly around here.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,soju6,3.88,"A: Pours a clear dark copper color with a nice head and some lacing.  S: Aroma is a pleasant roasted malt with traces of sice and citrus mixed in.

Taste is a clean breadiness with an earthy hop presence on this finish. Smooth flavor profile.  Slightly more heavy than I was expecting with moderate carbonation. Reasonably dry.  Solid lager here. Clean and crisp yet substantial taste profile. I guess this is a craft beer legend for a reason.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,fx20736,4.2,"Poured into a pint glass. Pours a thin offwhite head. Beer is a beautiful coppery red. Aroma is very bready malt with a tea like herbal hoppiness. Taste, starts out malty and quickly changes to a herbal, slightly astringent bitterness which then fades and finishes clean. This is a very well balanced beer where Malt & Hops each do their part.  Wow, what a great beer! Not at all what I was expecting. Reminds me of an English Pale Ale and looks like an Irish Red Ale. The clean finish is what gets me. This beer is favorful without being overpowering, smooth and refreshing. Drinking it, in some ways feels like quaffing some Sun-brewed Iced-Tea. This could definitely be added to the Summer Pantheon with the Pilseners, Hefes, Helles, APA's and Kolsches.  Note: After further reading I see that ASB is technically a Lager. It is a Lager that tastes alot like an Ale, much like Kolsch is an Ale that tastes alot like a Lager. This fact only accentuates the unique greatness of this beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,gatorguy,4.03,"One of my favorite beers, and a classic example of the California common style. Pours a deep amber/orange color and gives a nice white two finger head that slowly fades to some excellent lacing. Smell is of yeast, citrus, and a hint of earthy wood. Hoppy character is the nose for sure. Taste follows suit with some earthy hops, malts, and some citrus. Somewhat bitter aftertaste, in a good way. Mouthfeel is a little heavy, but not too much. This is an excellent brew, and a great way to get into the California common style.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,OMGTheyKilkenny,4.46,"12 oz. bottle into a dimpled mug.  A- Deep amber/orange, egg-shell colored head, very bubbly.  S- Strong malty lager yeast hits first followed by some citrus aromas. Smells like a very robust pilsner with a hint of Pacific ocean fog rolling into the bay.  T- Complex malt composition, you can really taste the lager and ale tastes fighting it out. Yeasty with a subtle sweetness. Notes of spices, cloves and maybe coriander. Supportive hops hold it all together. Alcohol and yeast give the aftertaste a bit of a kick.  MF- Rich and thick, just as bubbly as it looks. Really fills the mouth.  D- Lighter than it should be given everything that's going on, but still quite a body. A real beer drinker's experience. Nicely balanced, very unique.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Chunks of soapy lacing left behind.  Slightly earthy aroma with floral, piny hops, sweet malt and light fruit. Hints of caramel, toffee and nut.  Medium bodied with a slight creamy texture that adds fullness to the palate. Crisp floral hop presence up front that's only faintly dry and bitter. This is countered by the sweet malt and light fruit notes. Hints of caramel, biscuit, toffee, hazelnut and apricot. Well balanced and easy to drink.

The taste starts crisp, builds a slight apple-y taste, and finishes with some piney hops which linger on the tongue and strengthen as the beer warms. Even though the head quickly disappears, there's enough carbonation that leave me burping for a while.

28,63,Yoonisaykul,3.07,"Review from August 2010 notes. I think it was at Parker Pie Co.  A- Clear gold with a bit of a copper glow to it. Fine white foam covers the liquid throughout and leaves some great looking layered lacing.  S- Hard for me topick up anything here. Light grain with a slight caramel feel to it. Very lightly hopped.  T- The smell led me in the right direction but the taste is less boring. Some sourness, a bit of boiled veggies. I thought this would be more special. Very little after-taste. Not offensive though. Very little after-taste with a bit more of that sourness. A bit watery.  M- Fuller than the relatively thin taste. Low carbonation. Dry.  D- Very easy to drink.

28,63,Lauthaha,4,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a tulip glass.  Appearance: Beer is a deep golden color with definite tendencies towards amber. Head mellows down to a thin coating on the surface, and is unapologetically white.  Smell: It's pretty malty, with a gentle sweetness accented by slight lemon-like tones. Very crisp in the nose.  Taste: For some reason, it reminds me of sepia-toned photographs. Beer is pretty generous with the malt, and there's a very earthy hop bitterness that follows soon afterward. Aftertaste is a good mix of both. Lots of wood.  Mouthfeel: Enters crisply, unfolds with moderately heavy carbonation into a palate pleaser, and rinses mostly dry.  Overall: Good, all the way around. I've never tried a California Common, but it's not a style I will shy away from in the future. Very nice.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,rawfish,3.71,"Pours a rich amber into a shaker glass with a eggshell head reaching three fingers in height slightly over the brim of the glass. Excellent retention that folds in on itself into a dome cap though not much lacing.  Light biscuit maltiness with a touch of grain and hay on the back end. Low key spice notes lightly flowery.  Biscuits with a slight touch of spice and brown sugar sweetness up front, balanced by some grassy hop profile. Finishes crisp. Warming causes the beer to add a bit more adjunct lager corn flavors in the after taste.  Medium bodied with average carbonation. Finishes crisp and cleanly, smooth on the palate.  Standard for the California common, smooth and sessionable, but has much in common with any other amber lager. Its appearance stands out, never had such an impressive head on a lager before.

A: Pours a clear golden orange with one finger of off-white head. Strong retention and lace, nice, vigorous carbonation as well.  S: Light fruits and a bit of hay.  T: Sweet hay up front gradually transitions to a slightly dry, hoppy grapefruit finish. There is some light, dry biscuit present as well as some soft minerals. The beer sweetens a bit overall through the course of the glass, but just a bit.  M: Light and refreshing with both soda and creamy aspects.  O: I like this beer. It is uncomplicated and straightforward, a little understated, and very refreshing. Every bit as good as I remember it from decades ago.

28,63,Phelps,4.01,"Enjoyed in a shaker pint at Robbie Fox’s.  Deep amber with perfect clarity. The one-finger head of off-white is frothy and highly retentive, hanging out for a good ten minutes only to become a very thick, sticky top layer.  Not much to the nose. Sourish grain, hints of biscuits and freeze-dried apples.  The flavor expands on the aroma with lightly toasted biscuits, sweet red apple, apricot, lager-like yeast, some tangy grain and lightly earthy hops. The clean finish is surprising. Very nice.  Smooth, almost creamy medium light body with lightly massaging carbonation and soft fizziness. A slight bitterness lingers between sips.  I may have found a new favorite session beer; this was brilliant. Smooth, drinkable and surprisingly complex for what it is.

It ends on the spicy side again. 4/5  Mouthfeel- Nice even mouthfeel. A little on the thinner side of medium. 4/5  Overall- Even though I have had many, many beers this is the first time I have had this one.

I wouldn't say it's quite balanced, but it's not bad. Too many hops, though. The astringency lingers. I'm not a fan of that. Mouthfeel: It feels thicker than I expected from the appearance.

28,63,gabedivision,3.75,"Poured to a SA snifter glass.  Pours a dark reddish brown, chestnut, with a 1 finger head that laces around the glass quickly. Maple syrup on the smell, sweet malt, sugary much like a Bock. Sweet sugars on the tongue caramel, very grainy lager taste a tad bitter on the finish. The feel light and dry. Very enjoyable beer, has alot of good characteristics that are hybrid from other styles.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,bryehn,3.38,"Found in Ottawa, Canada. Listed as 4.8% with a BB of March 2013.  Pours a pretty golden-amber colour with a moderate tan head that doesn't leave any lace, but sticks around as a long-lasting film.  Sort of a fishy freshwater tone to the aroma at first. Tried in three glasses rinsed with different water to be sure. Once that wears off, there is a sweet malty aroma with a very subtle fruit backing and a dry grassiness to it. More honey-like sweetness comes through after warming.  Mostly sweet malts, then a well-balanced bitterness. Some raspberry-like fruity notes as it warms. Pretty mild, very stock ale-ish  Crisp but creamy on the tongue, but light-bodied overall. Slightly malty on the aftertaste, also has a mineral sharpness that reminds me of tonic water.  Love the look, description on the bottle and would love to try it fresh. However it's a bit too mild for my regular tastes, especially at the price in Ontario.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,TheHopMonster,3.92,"Appearance: pours a clean copper penny color, rocky carbonation and a thick white foam head with decent lacing.  Smell: Distinct malt characteristics along with earthy subtle grassy notes. Slightly floral and as I let the beer warm i can pick out some mild caramel characteristics.  Taste: Very unique its crisp like a lager but dry, with a very distinct west coast hop background like an IPA. Malty and bitter up front with a satisfying dryness at the end. very unique I must say.  In a class of its own I'm very pleased with this beer and I will recommend it to others",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,WYVYRN527,4.12,"This brew pours a brilliant golden orange with a fluffy white head that leaves sticky lacing all over the glass walls. Carbonation is lively and head retention's excellent.  Smell is sweet with notes of honey and biscuit, along with some fruity esters and a floral hop edge. Flavor is bitter at first, with some citrus elements, leading to sweet, grainy, honeyed notes. Finish is bone dry, and quite refreshing.  Overall, this light to medium bodied beer is one of the great session brews to come out of the States. A classic all in it's own, this tasty brew is one for the ages.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,suspect,4.25,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Dogfish Head shaped pint glass.  A: Crystal clear, pure orange, slightly light amber in color. Mildly aggressive pour leads to a huge fluffy 3 finger, super creamy head that disappears in under a minute. Lacing is spotty but present and sticks to the glass.  S: Citrus forward (lemony), the yeast is ultra present as well. Malt backend is present, yet subdued.  T: Unlike the smell, it's malt-forward as opposed to citrusy-hop forward. However, the hops are definitely present here. Lager-yeast is present on the backend.  M: Creamy, medium bodied, perfectly carbonated. Sticky mouthfeel.  O: What can I say? It's Anchor Steam. It's phenomenally unique. This is one of my go-to beers pretty much anytime.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,PDXHops,3.87,"12 ounce bottle poured into a shaker pint. Pale see-thru amber with a quickly reducing head, but a skim hangs on tenaciously.  Smells bready, metallic and a bit earthy. Flavor profile starts there, only more intense. Bitter to near astringency, which contributes to a bone dry finish. Raw and spicy. Ample carbonation fluffs it up to a fuller feel than anticipated. Mildly sweet, moderately toasty, exceedingly grainy. Nothing wrong with revisiting a classic now and then, nope.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,jadpsu,4.21,"Purchased on visit to Laurel MS. Purchased at Corner Market. Pours a most clear amber/orange with a full off white head with very good retention and side glass lacing. Aroma: Earthy malts, with a tinge of yeasty breads. Some citrus / lemon hops. Malts, bread with a nice touch of caramel, well balanced. Taste is a little sweet to start, then you get a dry bitter bite for an enjoyable finish. Very drinkable, would like to do a full session with these.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,vrushing88,2.33,"Had this beer on tap last night.  It presented with a dark golden color, with a quickly dissipating head.  I could smell mostly yeast in this beer.  The taste was somewhere between an amber lager and an amber ale, which I suppose was fitting for what they wanted.  No real feel to this. It was extremely light, and airy, almost as if it were floating in my mouth.  Overall I am not a fan nor am I impressed. I am not saying this is a bad beer. It just is not something I care for. Being on the east coast, I suppose I'm judging harshly as this is my first steam beer. I do plan to revisit.  I recommend this beer to anyone who would like to try steam-beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Smell: Grains and yeast with caramel malts and some earthy hops. Hop scent is fairly subdued.  Taste: Lots of caramel malts and grains up front with hints of citrus. Finishes with a mild hop bitterness. Tastes like a spring bock that has a more full malt presence.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a medium to high carbonation. Rich, creamy, and very smooth.  Overall: A very tasty and rich brew.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Has a nice hop bitterness to it.  M- Very smooth, medium body beer  O- A classic craft beer.

28,63,eclaycamp,4.18,"12 ounce stubby bottle poured into a 10 ounce glass. It's been years - perhaps a decade even - since I last had the famous Anchor Steam Beer. Pouring it again, for the first time, and I'm struck by the loads upon loads of carbonation in the brew. The bubbles just go on for days. Upon further inspection, this beer is brilliantly clear, as you can easily read the label from behind the glass. A big frothy head bursts to the top of the brew, but recedes just as quickly. Color is darker than gold but not quite amber, settling in at a rusty orange. Smells of a light grain, almost like a pilsner. First taste is sweet, almost fruity, with a very sweet malt finish. This - this is not like I remember at all! Moderate bitterness in the finish, but not overpowering at all. Slightly sticky and relatively thick mouth feel, though the heavy carbonation helps to scrub the taste off your tongue as you drink it. As you continue to taste the malt becomes more and more pronounced, and it works in context with the yeast profile to create almost a jam and bread flavor. An underrated gem.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,alenonbeeradv,3.08,"At at bar with a lack of beer and kinda bored soooo..  A - amber, copper, rust, a little head that vanished after a couple minutes. It looks alright.  S - umm nothing? Maybe it's the glass but it just kinda smells like sweet and stale beer... probably the glass. A tiny bit piney and fruity but just ever so slightly.  T - malty, earthly, mildly bitter. Nothing serious which is why I can see this beer being so widley distributed. it's handleable if ur not looking for a mouthful of hops when in search of an ale or an ipa.  M - again pretty tame. medium carbonation level but a bit of a bite although still pretty light.  O - if there is no other game in town then go for it but I probably would been better off with just a water.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

T: bitter lemon and earth, it tastes a little bit like a cup of iced tea that has been steeped just a little too long.  M: light bodied, sharp on the tongue with a bone dry finish.  O: I'm a huge fan of this beer, it's one of the beers that prompted me to start exploring in my early days. It's kind of strange to come back to it, I think my palate has been irreversibly changed by the beers that I drank in the intervening years, but in many ways it's just as good as I remember.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,peensteen,3.65,"Pale copper colour, Light white head, no lacing to speak of here. Smell is malty, slight caramel and toffee, an earthy grainy note, slight hop bitterness in the nose.

Taste: Malt, with some hops and a mineral water quality. Quite good and not over bearing. The hops aren't as ""woody"" as some imitators I've tasted and I mean that as a compliment.

Aroma is typical of a lager, with the malt dominating. The malt is evident in the taste too, with hints of hop bitterness in the finish. Crisp, refreshing beer that is perfect for a hot, sunny day and is one of the perfect session beers around. A fine beer from Anchor Brewing and is definitely worth a try.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Chico1985,3.75,"Pours a rusty orange/brown color, white head starts huge and retains well at a finger leaving some lacing.  Starts out with American lager scent all the way, grainy/cereal-y, improves wholly with warmth with nice earthy and grassy hop notes and faint caramel malt.  Earthy and light fruit hop bitterness up-front with nice pale and toasty malts, a bit macro-y on the finish giving off a more grainy vibe, warm bread taste lingers afterwords. Light crisp mouthfeel, a bit overcarbonated.  A classic, a big stepping stone in the craft beer world. Definitely has more going for it than your average American lager but not something I'd feel the need to pick up often.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,PicoPapa,3.95,"On tap. Pours a translucent mahogany color with a thin layer of head. Virtually no lacing. Aroma is of toasted malts, bread and slightly sweet.

S: a light toasted grain. similar to cheerios. a woody presence as well from the hops.  T: a minty, sharp bitterness is first and foremost. the malt is brushed aside by this hoppy body, much opposite the nose.  M: a light body with medium/hard carbonation.  D: an american craft classic that is super drinkable and showcases an american hop that isn't dominated by citrus.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Mit,3.83,Pours a nice clear amber colour. Nice head lingers for a little while.  Malty notes with some slight citrus hop characteristic. very pleasant.  Bitter notes both hoppy and possible from any roasted malts...very nice finish...I remember trying this years ago and thinking it was a hop bomb...oh how the palate has changed.  solid for the 4.5 abv.

28,63,Satchboogie,4.03,"12oz bottle (bottled 12/16/10) poured into a pint glass  A: Regular pour leads to a 3-finger, off-white foamy head with lots of bubble action and is fairly quick to evaporate. Somewhat cloudy, gold copper color that almost like a really light rust (not in a bad way).  S: Lightly toasted malts, a little floral hop character, a little lemon citrus, toffee.  T: Right up front you get that nice floral hop character, almost seems a mix between english style and german style hops. Floral with a little lemon citrus; very clean, earthy, and a little bitterness. The malts come in right behind it, slightly toasted with a 'heaviness' and flavor that seems almost like a brown ale. Fairly long middle with the toasted grains, actually there's a good bit of depth too, almost like a somewhat dark multi-grain bread. There's some toffee-like sweetness, just enough to clean out the hops and grains, seems like the perfect balance. The citrus and floral hops come back again in the finish to give it just a tiny bite and slight bittering finish, though it's still clean and crisp.  M: Lots of lively carbonation that lasts a long time on the palate. Medium body, akin to a good brown ale. Crisp and refreshing.  O: A good, solid beer that is tasty, balanced, and refreshing. I feel like this will make a fantastic summer beer and a nice break from over-the-top IPAs.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Kegatron,4.1,"22 oz bottle into a pint glass.  Pours a crystal clear copper, with 2-3 thick fingers of off-white head. This settles down into about a solid finger’s worth, leaving back a creamy latticework of foamy lacing. The aroma is thick in the nose, with a mix of fruit, caramel, and bread, which is then softened on the edges somewhat by notes of leafy earth and a light spicy feel.  The taste has a crisp bitter bite to it, which snaps across the tongue. This is well balanced by a strong backbone of caramel sweetness, which has some sturdy toasted edges to it. The finish is dry and lightly spicy, with some lingering notes of bitter fruit. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a lively and crisp feel that dances around in the mouth, before smoothing out into an easy creaminess across the back.  This is the beer that started the craft beer revolution in this country and it’s still going strong all of these years later. I hadn’t had this in a while and sitting down with a 22 oz helped me realize again how flavorful and just plain drinkable this can be when you sit down with it. 40 years later and still going strong, this beer is a winner.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,Knapp85,3.68,This is a good consistant brew. The pour is golden in color with a nice solid white head on top that beer a good lacing down the glass. The taste of this beer is pretty standard but yet has enough flavor to keep it interesting. Mostly hops and malts on the tongue. The smell is basically the same. Mouthfeel is easy going.

Color is decent, if not a little flat. Copper and brownish, with amber highlights. Smell is of sweet smokey caramel, tinny adjuncts. Honestly, not too impressed by the aroma. However, the taste is a different matter! I had no idea this style of beer was so flavorful! Lots of full, malty tastes of wood, grain and grass and balanced with a fruity/flowery hops bite. The hops bitterness swells but never really crests in a buzzsaw of sticky pine resin; instead it strikes a nice balanced chord of taste. Unlike any lager I've ever had before, really a unique brew. Has a mild sweetness in the background. Glossy, polished tastes. Exceptionally clear flavors! Decently bodied lager, more character and a bit more body than most American lags.  Despite it's mediocre aroma, this beer really came out and shone for me. A classic American craft beer, the West Coast is proud.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

T - Smell carries into taste, full of hop bitterness, which lingers to the back of the throat. Cherry-Fruit taste apparent in aftertaste. Taste seems to mellow out and get better as you drink it, possibly due to warming up.  M - Watery, little carbonation.  D - This is a good beer for a Lager. I'm not a huge Lager fan, but after seeing a raving review on Youtube, decided to pick it up on my last trip to Nova Scotia.

A very easy going, straightforward beer. Taste improves and more elements come out as the beer warms.  M - medium body with not too much carbonation. A nice balanced approach that doesn't get in the way of the flavor.  D - overall, very enjoyable. It wasn't quite what I expected, but it was great and a beer that I would love to drink a few of.

The body is a clear golden orange with a good number or rising carbonation bubbles. Decent lacing lines the sides of the glass nicely.  Dark fruits and sugary sweet malt aromas combine with floral and citrus hops.  A bready, earthy maltiness starts each sip. Grapefruit and spicy hops finish. There is a great balance between the malt and the hops as neither seems to dominate especially, though it does have a dry finish.

28,63,TheWhiskerReview,3.84,"Pours a hazy reddish-orange with a small white head, reducing to a small ring and moderate lace through most of the brew.  Nose is a delightful mix of candied oranges, brown sugar and cinnamon-dusted, raisin-filled toasted dark bread. The hops add notes of bitter flowers and bright melon.  Palate is a touch bitter and faintly smoky, with a light body and an oily, nutty addition to the nose's bready character. It seems to have lost the nose's brown sugar lushness, making it seem a tad thinner. The notes of molasses and lemon on the nice finish make up for it though.  Overall, very nice sessionable brew.

I smell wood, earth and spice. There are caramel malts and hints of toffee and fruit. A light hop profile gives the beer a good bite. Good balance. One of a kind.  Taste: Carbonated chewy maltiness gives way to a slight bittering blast of carbonated hoppiness. The beer finishes quite spicy. It's heavy in tannins with mouth clinging malts. Earthiness. Some citrus and grain. Cocoa aftertaste. A good solid recipe with a lot of character.  Mouthfeel: Light to medium. Good grainy texture.

Perhaps slightly better than expected.  The aroma was light, with notes of biscuits and a little hops.  The taste was good, some hops upfront, but more malty as I drank the beer which gave it a light hint of sweetness. Nice aftertaste followed.  The beer was light, smooth and crisp.

28,63,Traquairlover,4,"12-oz bottle poured into a tulip pint glass.  A = A very nice, clear orange amber color, with a small off white head consisting of mostly small bubbles and interspersed with medium bubbles. Head is not huge and does not remain overly long but a think covering of bubbles remains well into the glass. As head recedes there is a small amount of lacing but that is not a prominent artifact on the glass by the of it.  S = Clean scents of a hay field, very light traces of pines, turf, fresh turned soil, some evanescent smells of fresh soap not as in an antiseptic, but more of a clean refreshing type of smell.  T = The tastes closely track the smells but with perhaps a bit more floral qualities. The basic bready, grain tastes are there, along with some amount of twang reminiscent of citrus (orange and lemon) but not quite, good long dry finish.

28,63,Naugros,4.15,"Yes, I've had quite a few of these in the past and just got around to reviewing one. Hey, I don't have that style reviewed yet, so here goes.  This beer has been consistent from the '70s and is one of the forerunners of all craft brews in the US. It deserves your respect, but I'll try not to let that sway my judgment.  Amber/orange in color, crystal clear with a cream-colored head that stands proud at about an inch with really good structure and pretty decent retention. Pretty beer.  Refreshing floral smell, rich with noble hops against a malt presence reminiscent of honey oat bread. Very perfumy and not in a bad way.  Noble hops again balance well with the honey/oat bread malts. Same as you smell and very crisp. Again, the consistency of this beer over the decades is amazing. The beer you tasted in '80s (I wasn't of drinking age in the '70s) is the same as you taste now. Remarkable!  Again, crisp...and clean. Not a lot of aftertaste and what IS there is that perfume you get in the nose that is thrown off from the noble hops. One of the easiest drinking craft brews in the US, this is a classic and, at the risk of repeating myself, deserves respect for what it meant to the craft brew movement in this country. Fritz Westinghouse...I know you sold it, but you saved it. I love you man!

28,63,Snamnoum,3.93,"Appearance - honey peach color. Produced two fingers of beige head with good retention and average lacing.  Smell - plenty of fruit and yeast akin to a belgian beer even though its a lager. Tiniest hint of hops and a big malt backbone.  Taste - bitterness upfront and through out. Fresh doughy yeast contrasts well with the hops and biscuity malt. Excellent drinking beer.  Mouthfeel - medium bodied, moderately carbonated and chewy feel.  Drinkability - very drinkable this is an great alternative to an IPA or a Pale Ale for a thirst quenching, hot day beer.  *Plus my girl friend, not a beer geek, but a girl who none-the-less enjoys a good beer really likes this one.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,afogg0855,3.51,"I usually skip over this beer when I'm at the liquor store due to the vast over-usage of nautical terms to try and sell beer. (SeaDog, Shipyard, Harpoon, etc.) It's nothing against the beer itself, just parody in general.  It pours a huge creamy head you could float a golf ball on. Very light smell of sweet malts, sorta like corn pops lol.  Theres more alcohol taste than you would expect with a sub 5% abv.

T: Apple is definitely there, along with other esters - odd given lager yeast was used, but hey - it's a steam beer. Cream. Apple finish.

Perfectly simple taste that isn't flashy with tons of conflicting flavors. The malts are light sweet and toasted on the lowest setting. The hops are earthy and muted but present in flavor and bitterness albeit light on both counts.  Mouthfeel Is vey smooth and lightly carbonated. A body very easy to deal with and very easy to drink.

28,63,dogfishandi,3.86,"12oz bottle at fridge temp poured into a standard pint glass. bottling code 0NA indicates it was bottled on November 1,2010.  pours out a very nice clear copper/ amber color with a decent amount of carbonation bubbles. a nice one and a half fingers of soapy white foam that slowly faded to a retentive layer that lasted more or less the whole glass. left a lot of sticky lace.  not the most exciting aroma. you can definatly tell its a lager. minerals and hay like grains are the most apparent with just a touch of some lemony citrus and some cooked corn.  again lots of mineral like lager yeast with a nice tasting toasted grain. hops are there just enough to balance, maybe a slight lemon citrus and floral hop flavor. subtle bitterness in the finish.  medium to light in body, carbonation is a tad high. a slightly dry finish.  drinks very easily, an easy session beer with a very easily managable abv. this could be a pivotal beer in converting a BMC drinker to craft. i would come back to this, but IMHO, its only slightly better than say yuengling, but practically double the cost. however, i think every craft enthusiast should atleast try this once.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,BasementBer,3.31,"A great piece of American beer history. Particularly in that this label represents a regional history and a specific time period of industrial manufacturing. To their benefit, Anchor Brewing leaves the story a bit brief and general on the bottle adding to the allure of just how this beer got so cemented in the small-scale brewing milieu.  A: Thick, lasting head with tight bubbles. Consistent lacing around the glass. A light amber (though self described as being a 'deep amber') which doesn't wow me. After 15 minutes, ""steam"" bubbles still flowing at pace.  S: Initial smell reminds me of Budmilloors, with a slightly more hoppy-sweeter aroma. Smells like cheap beer.  T: Simple, less bitter than I would like, but a seemingly rustic beer cannot afford or be expected to change its recipe to fit modern hop-head cravings. So for this very reason, and the oft reason that this is the only true California Common that gets carried in my neck of the woods, it deserves positive reinforcement.  M: Again, simple. Nothing jumping out here, not even bitterness that speaks dry hopping or freshness. A pale lager taste that barely steps over that base light beer hurdle.  D: Heavy drink-ability in terms of putting back a true bitter beer than most where the hops stands tall and fast.

The same corn stuff was evident, but with the bitterness of the hops to balance, it was a good drink. Didn't get anything specific from the hops, just leafy goodness. Malt was corny (LOL) but nice on this case.  Mouthfeel and drinkability went hand in hand, as the smoothness and dry clean finish lent itself well to both.

Smell- Not much in terms of smell, breads and malts are definitely there, but I really have to try to get it.  Taste is really more complex than I thought it would be, -starts off malty, turns into nutty, and dries down almost sour (in a good way).  Mouthfeel is slightly oily, which I'm not a huge fan of. The ""feel"" tends to linger longer than I want it to, and I wish that it were a little bit more dry after all was said and done.  Drinkability is not exactly there entirely.

While it has a nice color I'm not impressed with the head.  Smell: Mild toasted malts with a hint of citrus hops. Very balanced.  Taste: Again, very balanced here. Toasted malt up front blending nicely into a citrus like hop finish. Malts are maybe a little bit ahead here on the balance, but overall the combination is quite nice.

Hopefully those old memories are still here since I occasionally have it.  Anchor Steam pours a nice off white head of a very large four fingers. It has a gorgeous clear color of dark to brown copper. Wonderful ice cream cone retention on the head as well, looks like a root beer float. Some small carbonation from the bottom. Some stickyness and lacing. She looks good in the pint!  A very faint airy malt aroma, but a very nice one. Small grain in the nose kind of lingers after you pull the beer away. Some very faint hops.  On taste it's at first a sweet grain, then gives way to a subtle hop finish. Fells a little carbonated in the mouth and wet but the body doesn't feel like complete water. Quite solid and good nothing fancy, just simple.  Anchor steam is still solid just as I remember it. Inexpensive to boot too and easy drinking.

28,63,Jadjunk,4.23,"#74. Somewhat keen on discovering how this beer differs from a traditional lager. It can be found in better beer selection supermarkets, which is where I found this in a mix-your-own-six variety pack.  Poured from a 12 oz. stubby bottle to a pint glass at room temp.  (Appearance) Whoops. I poured this beer pretty aggressively! Beer yields at least a 4 finger depth, thick dense fluffy foamy creamy head that retains like a champ, trickling downward at a very slow pace and slowing from depreciating more once at a modest 1.5 depth. Some light lacing is present as the head recedes, but it has no staying power and is gone by the end of the drink. Color is amongst the purest of deep oranges with deep amber shades included. Looks almost like a late sunset. Clarity is absolute with this beer. Carbonation is a sporadic arrangement of tiny active bubbles. Acts and looks promising. 4  (Smell) An earthy hop and faintly breaded caramel malt blend are subtle and the beer smells very fair and balanced. The caramel tones round out the aroma to balance the beer's bitter and sweet notes. Very light and fair on the nose, but the balance is spot on. Aroma better emphasizes the beer's sweet side. It could be far more potent but its appealing in smell nonetheless. 4  (Taste) First impressions gather a wonderful exchange of sweet and bitter tastes, with sweet dominating the first half and a bitter finish rounding out the end product. Some clean caramel malts are easiest to pick out through the entire experience, but the subtlety is outstanding, avoiding masking the equally impressive bitter characteristics of the earthy, faintly citrus-like hopped finale. Simply easy to drink for a variety of reasons; there's nothing here that slows down the pace. Really a good choice for people entering the beer craft world from both macros and common micros. Reminds me of some of good Samuel Adams lager brews. 4  (Mouthfeel) Incredibly smooth and creamy texture. Beyond the first moments the rest of the beer is thin and glides past the palate without any resistance or extra texture. On the thin side of things but without being watery or bland. This beer has a light-medium body and a decent dose of sweet character up front and a bitter profile in back. Dry, but wonderfully dry. 4  (Drinkability) Outstandingly drinkable. This beer has an amazing balance of favorable flavors without omitting a single necessity for a damn tasty beer. Drinks smooth, tastes balanced and enjoyable, and no flavors wear down on the drinker. For a very simple beer, this hits all the right chords. One six pack to myself would be a fantastic choice. 5  Verdict: If you've ever thought about trying a ""steam"" beer, this one is a definite good starter choice. Very drinkable and delicious, two of the most important characteristics of the perfect beer. If you find it, you should get it. A- (4.2)",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,marty21,4.42,A: Pours a deep golden colour with a large white creamy head. Settles to a solid cap and left decent lacing for the most part.  S: Malty that blends nicely with a hoppy aroma. A little citrus in there as well.  T: Malty with that finishes with some hops. At times I can feel a lemony pepper taste building up but it never fully comes together. It keeps me coming back to try and acquire that taste.  M: Lighter carbonation with a medium body. Very drinkable.  D: A very different beer unlike any I've had before but it was quite enjoyable. It isn't too complex but that's what makes it so great. I could see myself easily picking up a 6-pack after trying this beer. It would be a great session beer.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Nerudamann,3.8,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  Look - bit of a dark amber in color, clear, with about a finger's worth of light khaki-colored foam that dissipates slowly. Good carbonation.  Smell - definitely has a malty/hoppy mix. Slight floral hints. Maybe some maple sugar?  Taste and Mouthfeel - definitely a unique and different taste. Bitterness from the hops is present. Balanced out slightly by the malts. Definitely tastes like a beer that's gone through a different fermentation process than the norm. Texture is well-balanced.  Drinkability - not extremely complex in taste but definitely unique. Definitely worth a six-pack to acclimate yourself to the taste.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,JonathanCrites,3.7,"I bought this as part of a build your own six pack at the Krogers on W Gray in Houston.  A - Pours a bright amber into a pint glass with a tan head.  S - Lots of floral and grain aromas in the in the smell, also a sweet note like orange or lemon.  T - Taste follows from the smell, lots of grain with a variety of floral and herbaceous flavors. Delicious.  M - Light-medium mouthfeel, lots and lots of carbonation.  D - Low ABV, easy to drink outside of the heavy carbonation.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,SnowGoon99,4.1,"Serving type: bottle into a Sam Adams glass.  Pours a dark straw or ""dirty blonde"" if you will. Nice thick head to start with but dissipates quickly. Aromas include a little sulfur with some earthiness and hints of caramel. Definitely more lager-like than ale-like which i guess is the point.  Flavors include the earthiness again from the hops and the slight caramel from the malt. A good balance here. It is carbonated a little more than your typical beer but right on for a lager beer. Was wishing for a little bit more body but the carbonation does help with the drinkability a lot. Very easy drinking.  Overall a nice beer. It is pretty much the quintessential California Common beer as it was pretty much the original. It is the style. But slowly forms of it are starting to emerge which is good. It's not an exceptional beer but it certainly is easy-drinking and when your looking for a couple lagers to drink one night or looking to get friends into craft beer, this may be the beer for you.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,seedsofchaos,3.63,"Bottle was imported from out west, obviously, and had probably been sitting on the shelf for some time. Possibility of light exposure very possible.  Pours amber with hints of copper with a head that quickly dissipates even though active carbonation is present. Lacing is fine but lasting. Sweet malts pierce the nostrils with a healthy amount of caramelization. Buttery and creamy smelling but not of a diacetyl nature. The yeast seems to be doing something a bit funky with fruity undertones; perhaps a bit skunky/light-struck.  The flavor is very malt forward with just a touch of green apple (cidery) taste that's quite bothersome. Yeasty and tart in the aftertaste that is reminiscent of a homebrew that was over primed with sugar. The hop notes that are able to squeeze through are very earthy in nature. The taste of this beer, however, is off-putting.  All in all, I believe that I received an inferior example of this style due to storage and shipping. I'd love to try this beer fresh on tap in California as I've heard wonderful things. Highly sessionable, this brew probably could have been a winner.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,KickInTheChalice,3.83,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Anchor Steam pours a dark orange color, cloudy with large bubbles clinging to the bottom of the glass before their inevitable ascent to maintain the head on top. Although a modest foamy white head is initially visible, it fades to a film with a pronounced ring.  Smell: Light toasted malt, long-lasting earthy hops.  Taste: A bit of caramel sneaks through, but the flavor here is mostly a modest level bitterness, with just a dash of tart lemon. The malt back is reminiscent of a toasted biscuit, but the earthy hop flavors step in front. The finish stays bitter.  Mouthfeel: Briskly carbonated, as was apparent from the appearance. Slightly dry, more so at the finish. Grainy and slightly astringent with a light to medium body.  Drinkability: This is definitely a beer worth trying. It is Anchor's flagship beer and has by far the most reviews of any Steam beer. There is a fair amount going on here, especially for an American Lager at 4.9%.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

D - Very drinkable. A refreshing beer with a great taste.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,scubasteve04,4.01,"Poured aggressively into a standard pint glass, apparently too aggressively as indicated by the 5 inches of foam in my glass. I let it settle for a minute and then poured the remainder of the bottle in. Took my first drink just below 45 degrees F, I'd guess.  A: Really classic, awesome looking brew. A not quite white, spongy head on top of the coppery, bubbly beer with a nice touch of red color in the right light.  S: Smell is pretty mild. Earthy, malty, and maybe just a bit of bitter hops. So fresh and so clean, clean.  T: You get a nice malty sweetness right up front, then a mix of hop bitterness and astringency with a really nice, clean, crisp finish. Perhaps just a trace of citrusy sour/bitterness left in the mouth, but not much.  M: Very light, bubbly, yet still very smooth and not watery. Surprised me, pleasantly.  D: Drinkable as hell. This would be a great go-to superbowl or ""insert sporting event here"" beer to drink all day with some good company. If it were not close to my bedtime I would have kept going.  I got this six-pack as a Christmas gift this year, and had not heard of it until then, so I didn't quite know what to expect. Turned out to be a great gift.

There's a strong breadiness to this one with a slight amount of hops. Very grainy and metallic. I'm picking up some sweet fruits in a subtle way. Mouthfeel is nice, well carbonated, smooth.

A ring of bubbles exists throughout with some bubbles sticking to the glass to form lacing.  The smell is odd, butter, green grapes, and apple provide an almost champagne like smell.  I would say that this is better tasting than what I was expecting. There is a firm maltiness to it with subtle hops. The balance is nice with a very clean aftertaste.  Light to medium in the mouth, as I mentioned above, the aftertaste is clean. A small bit of bitterness adds some zing to the aftertaste.

28,63,BFrost,3.13,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a mug. The color is a transparent amber with a slightly off-white head that appears to have nice density, but it fades quickly, though a decent lace is left after the head does fade.  The smell is initially faint, but eventually light malt, barley, and hops are noticed. A favorable bitterness is also present in the nose.  The barley, malt, and hops are present on the tongue as well, but it does not taste quite as bitter as it smells. The carbonation is light on the tongue, then it is smooth as it goes down.  Notes: This is my first encounter with a beer of this style. it is easy to drink, enjoyable, and would not be a poor choice on a night out with friends. It looks and tastes like a typical American Amber. I'd probably have mistaken it for one if I hadn't any knowledge of it being something else.

Web style lacing on the sides of the glass.  S- Citrus style hops are the first thing in the aroma. Caramel malts show up as well with a hint of piney hops in the background. Nothing over the top but smells like some have said to a pale ale....and I agree.  T- Light citrus hops upfront with a hint of caramel malts. The middle of the flavor has some bready malt backbone that shines with a light sweetness. The ending of the flavor has piney hop bite to it with light caramel malts. The alcohol bite to this comes in very lightly and exits just as quickly.  M- Light mouthfeel. Carbonation is good for the style. Flavors left on the palate include caramel malts and light piney hops. Aftertaste includes light alcohol, bready malts, and yet again the piney hops. Medium drying on the palate from the alcohol. Flavors were well balanced and no off flavors overall in the beer.  D- This was a good beer that I didn't mind at all. In fact I thought it was a lot better than what I figured it was going to be.

28,63,TheHammer,2.53,"Given that Anchor was the original steam beer, I'm going to try to use as many sea and sailing comparisons as I can in this review.  Appearance: This Lager pours with a frothy white layer of sea foam, an eighth of a span high which sticks to the side of the of the glass like a few stray barnacles to a ship. It lingers decent enough, as ample carbonation arise from bronze depths, coloured as the sky at sunset. A bit more lacing and retention is needed though.  Smell: What a happy coincidence, as this smells like what I would expect spiced grog to smell like. A great deal of yeasty spice with a bit of orange scent (perhaps to fight the scurvy?) and a light toasted bread touch. It warms the heart, but it's about as tame as still water.  Taste: Argh...we're running aground here. It sets sail to a calm sweet malt with orange notes, with only but a mild touch of yeast to warn you of the storm ahead. The beer turns to overpowering dry yeast that kills your thirst as sea water would. It ends as all who visit Davy Jones's Locker, with a bitter end as dry musty hop taste that is accented with sulphur that sinks the ship.  Mouthfeel: Well, the carbonation is good and the aftertaste lingers as long as a small boat's wake, which is good. However it leaves you as dry as the bones of dead men, left to bleach in the sun. Transitioning is a bit too abrupt for my liking.  Drinkability: This beer is quite possibly the only beer I've had that leaves you thirstier then when you started drinking it! It's light bodied and easy to keep down which is good if you are getting your sea legs, but not if you want to drink something. Too dry and about as satisfying as having to walk the plank.  Final Thoughts: Well, if you are on a boat with this stuff, I would suggest you follow the beer's namesake and pitch it overboard. It's like you found a treasure map, were overjoyed to a calm sea journey, only to toil through storms & pirates at great cost only to find that the treasure you found, didn't even cover the cost of the journey. Disappointing, although not unexpected I'd have to say. I knew Steam Beer had weird yeast so maybe it's just not the style for me. In conclusion, it won't leave you shanghaied, but don't expect smooth sailing so you'll want to pass.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

T - Delicious bready malt flavors abound; smooth, faint sweetish malt finish. I was expecting a sweeter malt taste, to follow the caramel nose. But, this was a combination of some bitter and sweet notes; more roasted malt flavor.  M - Creamy effervescence.

The head vanished rather quickly and left behind a small amount of lacing  S: Had the aroma of sweet, bready malts with a small kick of floral hops.  T: A tiny amount of floral hops leapt out initially upon drinking. These were quickly followed by sweet, creamy malts and a lightly pronounced taste of crisp champagne towards the finish. Very unique upon the palate.  M: Lightly carbonated with a light mouth-feel which surprisingly retained a smooth and crisp finish. The finish alone kept beckoning me to drink more and more.  D: All around a very solid beer. Unique yet familiar, Anchor Steam possess a nicely balanced kick of floral hops of sweet malts which don't overpower the palate.

28,63,Vito,1.92,"Anchor Steam. I thought I'd give it a try, because I overheard a few people talking about it during a recent visit to San Francisco. Here goes:  Appearance: It has a unique look. It pours a burnt-orange color that glows like the fluid in a lava lamp. Thin head that looks like the foam on a glass of iced tea.  Smell: I really couldn't smell anything at all.  Taste: I don't like the taste. Bitter, sour, acidic.  Mouthfeel: Average. Low carbonation, but still sort of crisp.  Drinkability: Nope.  For me, Anchor Steam is custom-made for the kind of beer drinker who orders one beer, takes a few sips, and talks about how great it is instead of actually finishing the bottle and ordering another. I can't understand why this beer gets such high ratings. I guess it's one of those ""Emperor's New Clothes"" things.

28,63,cuttsjp,4.23,"Appearance: Pours a beautiful amber color with nice clarity and beautiful, visible bubbles sparkling through. Small but persistent white head. Some lacing. Overall very pretty. Not all that different from a nice IPA.  Aroma: Sweetness in the aroma, with the fruitiness of raisins up front. A little bit tropical pineapple as well. Very west coast. A little grassiness from the hops but overall lots of malt character.  Flavor: A nice toasty malt background with some cereal graininess and a little hint of sweetness. Definite detectable Germanic lager character. Great west coast hop flavor, nice and floral but also a bit spicy and citrusy...definitely Northern Brewer hops. This beer is at once totally California and totally Germany, if that makes any sense. Completely balanced and totally satisfying.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, medium-high carbonation. Crisp like an IPA but with a lager finish.  Overall: Drinking this beer is always a pleasure. It is very balanced and very drinkable, with enough complexity to stand out over other ""drinkable"" beers. The fact that it is a lager but is fermented at ale temps and aged/conditioned in interesting ways definitely adds to the complexity. This is one of the few American styles of beer that doesn't just shove a mouthful of hops down your throat.

Smell - 3.5 Not a lot of aroma, a little melon-like fruit and toasty, nutty malt.  Taste - 4.0 Quite bitter in the finish, but unusually for an American craft beer, there is more malt than hops on the palate. Quite savoury and rather salty - I'm sure this would go well with salted peanuts. Just a little malt sweetness, a little caramel and lots of roasted nuts. A little fruit mid palate, then goes on to finish nutty and dry.  Mouthfeel - 4.0 Light to medium bodied with persistent, very fine carbonation.  Drinkability - 4.0 Sessionable in its strength and would no doubt pair well with many savoury foods.  OVERALL - 3.8 I wonder if I'm the only person who thinks this beer tastes very similar to James Squire Amber Ale? My first steam beer, the original steam beer - I like it, but not so much that I would choose it over a pale ale. I actually found the saltiness a little too much and wonder whether it is typical of other California Commons.

Smell: Mostly the sour scent from apples (think unripe granny smith) with hints of alcohol. Perhaps a touch of malt as well.  Taste: Light malt taste that is equal parts toasty and caramelly with notes of dark cookie. Simultaneously is a hop bitterness that is light but firm. Ends with a strong minerally taste with a bit of caramel and bitterness that lingers on the palette.  Very chewy mouthfeel. Low-medium carbonation.

28,63,TylerBGoode,4.07,"There's nothing quite like an Anchor Steam. At first glance it may seem as if it has a lot in common with your everyday Macro brew. But, as you nurse a glass of Anchor Steam, you'll soon find it's hidden complexities and it's undeniable uniqueness.  The appearance of an Anchor Steam isn't necessarily anything to write home about in my opinion. It pours a light color with little head with the accompanying smell is kind of underwhelming as well. It's the taste of this beer that has set it apart from so many of its counterparts. Though it is obviously, by all definitions, a beer, there really aren't many beers that are comparable to an Anchor Steam. It's bitter but not overly hoppy, malty but not thick, highly carbonated but not overly so. There also lies a hint of citrus sweetness and a earthiness in the flavor of this one. You don't often find such a well rounded flavor in such a light bodied beer.  The drinkability may be this beer's strongest attribute. Though the price usually keeps me from actually doing it, it would be easy go through a sixer in a single night. Seeing as how this is one of the only good beers served at one of my favorite restaurants, I tend to drink my fair share of Anchor Steam.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,bastardface,3.72,Good Red Ale. Has a copper color to it which leaves streaks as you drink. Has a pleasant taste with it's ripe flavor. Fairly impressed by the taste. A little fruity but not bad. I would recomend it. It's not the best beer to drink over and over but still worthy of high marks. This is the first Anchor beer that I remember drinking and it wasn't bad. It is possible that had it before but probably not somber enough to remember what it actually tasted like.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Dougal,2.77,"This was a bit of a disappointment....it was good beer with not much of the frills of many of the other beers that i would categorize it with. It was like a pale ale light, the lingering malt/hoppiness dance does not stay with you long and the beer tends to flatten out a bit towards the end of a sip.  It reminds me of a brown ale that is trying to be a pale ale but without the gusto....I'd like to try the liberty and hummer for comparison. Does the lower abv equate with a flatter taste?",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,coalcracker,4.25,"Appearance: Pours a mildy cloudy golden color with a good deal of carbonation. Smell: Rather floral aroma with a lighter malty base. Aroma transitions more to the malty side as the beer warms. Taste: A little bitter but pleasant sensation at the onset. This leads to a little more hop flavor in the form of citrus, notably lemon. Toasted malts appear towards the middle and lingers through the end. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied feel that feels a little dry in the finish. Drinkability: Very drinkable in terms of both ABV and taste.

Taste: This is a sweet and light beer with hints of citrus. The sweet malts are very well done and the citrus does a great job at keeping the malts from getting out of hand.

28,63,r0nyn,3.83,"Poured from a bottle into my trusty Troegs pint glass.  Pours a pretty dark apricot color that's pretty clear. Lines of bubbles rise up from the bottom towards the off-white head that's about two inches thick before lowering down to a thin cap. Substantial amount of lacing. A very clean looking brew. Smell is full of malt and wheat, almost like a sweeter smelling lager. Just a bit of citrus at the end.  Malty sweetness kicks things off, with hints of fruits and a little bit of caramel. Towards the back end there's some mild hop bittering and astringency that lingers a few moments before disappearing.. Not too much of an aftertaste and it finishes clean and dry. An even balance between malts and hops throughout the flavor profile make for a simple, yet wholly pleasing tasting. Mouthfeel is good for a lager beer, with a good bit of carbonation and a medium body.  This brew is very easy to quaff and is probably the best new lager style I've tried in a long time. The taste crisp, clean and well done and coupled with a solid mouthfeel, come together to create a pleasing beer.

The aroma is of lime citrus as well as more of a corn syrupy smell along side of the general malty properties that are seen. The taste is both nice and rich in malt character. It is however quite abrasive in regards to the flavor. There is a lemon rind citrus flavor that provides both bitter and astringent properties to the flavor that I don't much care for. The mouthfeel is good as well as the beer is fairly good to drink once you are able to get past the astringent citrus. It's an interesting style.

28,63,steve8robin,4.18,"Heard a lot of good things about this brew, but never actually got to try it. 12oz bottle...  A: Super clear ruby red / copper mix with a thick 1+ inch white head that fades at a decent pace. Very good.  S: Smells of sweet banan upfront with some nice sugary malts. Hints of breadiness in the middle. Good.  T: Very nice breadiness with a very clean malt finish. Hints of banana and barley blended in. Good.  M: Medium body with a great carbonation feel. Very good.  D: This one goes down super easy. Very good.  All in all, this is a very good standard brew. Use this one as a standard for steam beers. This is very well balance. Worth trying at least once, despite availability.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,beorn7676,3.81,What else can be said about this beer that hasnt been said.  Pours a nice light amber orange with a large white head that fades fairly quickly.  Biscuity aroma wrapped in Northern Brewer hops.  Tastes of biscuit and bread with some caramel. Fairly strong hop bitterness.  Good body with a pleasing dry finish.  Pretty much the standard for the style. A classic.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,kagent777,4.05,"12 oz bottle poured into a goblet.  Appearance: A nice clear orange with a thin off white head.  Smell: I smell the ""almost honey"" smell that I get from lite lagers. This one is not quite the same. Once it warms up, the honey intensifies. Some light herbal hops also.  Taste: Nice clean almost zippy taste. Kind of an oddity to have honey in the smell but little if any sweetness in the taste. Solid toasty malt taste with a little bittering hops to back it. Could easily appeal to the BMC drinker you know.  Mouthfeel: The carbonation and body are middle of the road. The aftertaste is very dry and short.  Drinkability: At 4.9 ABV and no palate stressing flavors, this a very drinkable beer!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Soonami,4.1,"Anchor Steam is a classic American beer that I am ashamed for not having reviewed sooner. Tonight, while dining with a friend at Bobby's Burger Palace, I decided I'd have the Anchor and drink it carefully. This steam beer has a nice woody, minty hop flavor and aroma. The finish is a little sweet with a light fruitiness.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,chumba526,2.96,"Appears an orange color with a small white head.  It smells slightly citrusy, a little grainy, and a little sweet. There is not much going on in the smell.  the taste is comprised of a tad bit citrus flavor a mild malty sweetness and a nice mild bitterness to round the flavors together. There is a nice grassy flavor as well. The flavor is not too impressive though.  The carbonation is moderate high.  This is pretty drinkable I could drink a few of these easy.  Overall an average beer I know anchor steam did a lot to start the craft beer movement but now this beer pales compared to many of the ""new"" craft breweries. A decent beer that I would drink again but it is just average.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,LacquerHead,3.88,"Poured a copper color with a white head that clung to the sides of the glass  There is not much to the aroma - it had a faint hop smell. It had a good balance of hops and malt. The hops provided a good level of dryness and a slight bitter pine flavor. The malts lent a good caramel flavor, but were not too sweet. It had carbonation level was more on the softer side. I've had this beer a few times before, but I didn't think much of it other than thinking it was good. Overall this was a good beer and while I might not purchase a six pack I would defiantly have this at a bar.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,EricCioe,3.74,"This pours a medium gold in the glass with a half-finger head that dissipates in time and no lacing to speak of. On the nose, it's very withdrawn and weak, maybe a slight dried fruit presence, but it's very weak. On the tongue it's an explosion of flavor compared to the nose, dates at the front, a deep sweetness followed by a lighter citrus on the back of the tongue, lingering for a long while. Truly one of the better tastes I've experienced, and a total shock after the weak nose. In the mouth it's a wide and shallow feel, quite carbonated and fuzzy on the extremities. It's almost too distinctive to drink one after another, but it would be decent for a few.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,beerprovedwright,3.63,"Rich, thick, foamy head of just slightly off white. Two minutes it is calming down to a island in the middle of the field and a thick clinging lacing on the side of my glass. The rich color of amber, rating a 18 on the SRM Beer Color Chart. Piercing aroma of barley sweet malt and roasted wheat. Sharp and direct taste of lemon, chili, wheat, and green hops. Clean feeling on my tongue and a lingering finish of lime in by soft palate. Creamy and sharp needles of fluid on my gums, hard palate, tongue, soft palate and glottis. I have come to the conclusion that there are good beers and those that just try to make it in the world of beer drinkers. Most have little resources to buy good beer and accept the taste of mass produced mediocre beer as long as it gives them a buzz that helps them forget life's hardships. This beer is on a higher level, that delivers great flavor for a reasonable price.

There is a low amount of carbonation showing, and there is some amazing lacing sticking all over the inside of the glass. The head stuck around for a few minutes before it dissipated.  Smell - sweet caramel and hops, and lots of toasted malts.  Taste & Mouth - The beer actually has a fair amount of carbonation on the tongue, which is surprising due to its appearance. It comes across as slightly watery, but not my much. AT first I can taste light hops, followed by a big burst of roasted malts and some toffee/caramel. It finishes with a nice roasted and sweet aftertaste. I can even pick up on a slight smokiness.  Drink - This is an excellent beer that is highly sessionable. Worth a try if you see it at the store/bar.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,TonyVic,4.23,"This beer is classic. When poured it was clear, dark gold with a thick head. The head was really nice. It lasted all the way through the beer giving a nice refreshing aroma with every sip.  The body is full and creamy, giving a mouthfeel almost like clarified butter.  Aroma is hoppy and lightly floral but gives way to faint grassy scents.

A: Sunburst orange to golden in color, this beer has a massive, thick head like a cumulus cloud floating on a golden river. As the head recedes, it leaves a noticeable residue on around the circumference of the glass.  S: Malt, lager scents. Rather simple and inviting.  T: A really refreshing beer with a clean and easy taste, I find this to be rather enjoyable. There is a nice maltiness throughout, with a subtle hop bitterness near the back. There are delicate hints of fruit in there, as well. Overall, a very solid brew.  M: Medium bodied, and thicker than your average &gt;5% beer. Again, a very pleasant beer to drink.  D: Very sessionable and enjoyable. Absolutely worth a try.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

It's nearly transparent with a tall foamy head that quickly dissipates into thin lacing around the edges. Carbonations is light which makes this refreshing on the palate; very drinkable and smooth.  I get some nice malty sweetness in the smell and a little of the cascade hops. Some honey too.  The taste is wonderful. Well balanced with hops and grains. Going down it's smooth and refreshing with a solid body. It has a rich but not too sweet malty body with pleasant citrus and hop aftertaste.

The off-white head recedes a bit, then floats at an even keel while consumed as it is replenished by constant streams of small bubbles rising from the depths of the hazy amber brew.  The taste is bright and malty, with overtones of lightly browned toast and salty sea air enveloped in a well-carbonated mouth feel that sails over the pallet, with soft hop bitterness lingering on the tip of the tongue.  Always a dependable selection for a day at sea, or just sitting around pool side with your first mate (or second). The historic popularity of this beer is easily fathomed.

28,63,RickS95,3,"I'm not sure what steam beer is supposed to look like, so I don't know what to compare it to. Regardless, I like dark cloudy beer, and this is a darkish amber and translucent. There is a head of tiny bubbles, but there is little retention.  There's not much smell. Maybe some cut grass or straw, but little else.  It tastes like a pilsner, meaning there's little there but a peppery bitter taste.  It's a crisp refreshing drink. It doesn't have much body and is just an ordinary beer to me, but it is a palate cleanser and would be something worthwhile in the hotter months.  It's refreshing, doesn't taste 'bad' and is of average alcohol. Depending on what you're doing, you could have several of these in a sitting and not feel to bad about things. There are other beers I'd rather have, but these would do in a pinch.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

There's some general bitterness in the nose that comes together as a distinct hop note as you drink it. Some faint sweetness detected in the smell as well. The taste is rich for a lager; some malt flavor upfront with a nice dosage of piney hops on the back end. Overall a very ""clean"" taste but definitely more bold than your average lager. Not a whole lot of carbonation in this one. Doesn't feel heavy on the palate but more substantial than expected. I drank this a lot faster than I drink most 12oz beers; the bold feeling experienced does not in any way make you slow down and savor it.  Overall I was very impressed with this beer.

T- Bitter bitter hops open up heavily. Barley comes through to meld with the faint malt character. I did find the apples here along with a clean citrus finish. Absolutely no alcohol presence ( obviously ).  M- Smooth going around and down. I wouldn't call it watery, but it wasn't full either. Carbonation was a minimal player and this was beneficial in my mind.  D- I would definitely drink this beer again. It would appear to be a go to beer without a doubt.

It is a tribute to a time where craft brewing was just starting.  From the open to the poor, Anchor Steam has a good amber, copper color with a nice, creamy head. The hops are the shining jewel in this beer. With those good old Cascade hops you get that beautiful bouquet and that subtle, almost hidden in the background citrus bite. You try a sip and once you appreciate the complex, mellow goodness in your glass and you want more.  Anchor Steam as I have been told, holds the patent on the Steam name, meaning all other beers of this style must go by the ""California Common"" label.

Not floral or piney, more just a mild bitterness that usually offsets the rest of the beer well. The problem though is the rest of the beer. There's a cloying sweetness that is balanced only on random sips by the hops. Also, and I don't know if they use adjuncts or not, but I also would occasionally pick up a kind of nasty corn flavor.

28,63,WOTO97,4.13,"What a long strange trip it has been. Haven't had this SF original in years and finally got to cracking one open tonight. I know packaging isn't everything, especially in the world of craft beer, but this bottle (and quite possibly the SNPA bottle) really define the underlying character of craft beer for me. Okay, let's get to the nitty-gritty. The color is a nice copper with a dense pillow-like head that hangs out for a good while. Nose is full of earthy characters with a bit of lemon on the back end. Complementing the nose, the flavors on this one are primarily earthy in nature with a well-balanced malt profile and faint orange rind quality. The body is very pleasantly round while finishing pretty clean. I could go on describing this beer, but really it deserves to be drunk. Next time you're out grab a sixer of this classic.

28,63,snogglethorpe,4,"Nice rich gold color, small head. Smell is just ""beer smell."" Small short-lived head.  I think I initially didn't let the bottle warm up enough out of the fridge, so the taste was initially kind of ""average beer,"" a little bitter, not bad, but not great. I thought it was just an average lager-type beer.  After the beer had warmed up a bit though, it got much better, more like an Ale than a Lager, a lovely subtle and fruity taste, with a deliciously thick, oily, and creamy mouth-feel. The more I drank, the more I liked it, and in the end, I felt very sad that it was gone... After finishing, the fruitiness, along with an appealing tartness/bitterness, remained on my tongue for a long time. Yum!  The family resemblance to Liberty Ale is unmistakeable; though Anchor Steam of course doesn't have the forward hop character of Liberty Ale, they share a lovely mouthfeel and fruity character.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,streetcommander,2.98,Paid $9.50 for a six pack.  Beer presents well. Poured into pilsner glass and formed an impressive three finger head that hung out for a while. Good lacing.  Smell was average at best. It seemed to have a sweet unoffensive aroma that left me concerned that the flavor may follow suit. It did; not impressed at all. I was expecting a raw rough around the edges yet pleasant and distinct flavor. Got a bland unbeerish and disappointing flavor. No personality... Like the kind of people that buy Toyota Camrys. Bland and dead on the inside.  This is the kinda of stuff I would feed my grandma... Who doesn't drink.  Tried it on three seperate days to be fair. It seemed to get worse each time.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,goblue3509,3.92,"Pours a copper color with a one finger head which gives way to some faint lacing. The aroma is of caramel malt roasted malt and a hint of green fruits. The taste has a nice deep malt backbone of caramel and roasted malts. The middle and backend of a nice little generic hop bite with hints of green fruits. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated and a little dry. The drinkability is good, it is a solid beer, with nothing to make you dislike it, it is an easy drink with some nice flavor to it.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,nickydel,3.43,"I'm a little perplexed by this one. Lots of praise to be said. Gorgeous beer in the glass and a pleasing smell. I was impressed by the body for this type of beer. However, the damn thing tasted like soap, and the after taste was extremely bitter. I'm a big fan of huge IPAs and other very bitter brews, but this seemed extremely out of place and was not pleasant. A bad bottle? I have had Steam Anchor before and remembered it fondly, but I could barely get through this one. And I'm far from picky about different styles of beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

The taste is also malt with a faint hops flavor. Fairly bitter, but not overpoweringly so. Really a nice beer, and very nice after a hard days work.

28,63,ronniebruner,4.62,"One of my all time favorite beers. If you have never been to San Francisco to Pier 39, its worth the trip just to go to the Anchor Steam brewery. This is some of the best American beer on the market and criminally underrated. The smell, taste, and drinkability are second to none, and this is an enjoyable drinking beer, perfect for just about any occasion. Well rounded and not lacking. Very very close to brew perfection!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,rlshep,3.75,"Aroma: Clean Malt Aroma. Some apple and pears.  Appearance: Dark copper. Head dissipates quickly. Very clear. Faint lacing.  Flavor: Dark caramel followed by pine flavor from hops. Apple & pear subtle in background. Medium sulfur taste. Bitterness noticeable but well balanced.  Mouthfeel: High carbonation. Light body.  Overall: Fairly well balanced, caramel and pine dominates. Not overly impressed considering how much press this beer gets and high price tag. It is not refreshing enough to be an easy drinker and isn't complex enough to make me take notice.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Briken,4.06,"Clear copper with foamy tan head with good retention and little lacing. Pale malt and light floral aromas. Crisp pale malt with light caramel and floral hops all in subtle balance with a light grassy bittersweet finish. Sharp carbonation upfront l with a smoothing characteristic.  This is a very misleading beer. At first I was not entirely impressed as it seemed to be just another amber style beer.

S - Very mild aromas, mostly of malt. Caramel and toast. Some hops sneak in as well.  T - Light in flavor, the lager yeast is immediately noticeable. Malty with just a touch of bitterness from the very mild, floral hops. Mostly dominated by toasty malt.  M - Medium-bodied and smooth. Good, but not outstanding.  D - Finishes easy enough, and no reason not to enjoy more than one.

28,63,mlazzaro,3.99,"I always ignore anchorsteam but it is actually very nice beer.  I believe the ""steambeer"" A.K.A. a ""common"" beer, is the only American named beer style (aside from the arguable American I.P.A.) It is a Lager yeast strain that is able to ferment in warmer ale temperatures of 60+ degrees.  Appears a clear amber with healthy looking white head. Great head retention with a lacing ring of head for every sip. Exceptional looking beer.  Smells good, but not very strong. Malty-sweet, slight floral notes.  Tastes of light caramel and malty goodness. Crisp like a lager, but has some characteristics of ale flavors as well. Cream head has a nice mouthfeel. Suiting bitterness at the end. Zero offensive flavors/ holes and spikes in the sip.  On a side note, I like using anchor brewing co. bottles for homebrewing, they have unique nice looking bottles.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

T- Same as the aroma, but with a nice bitterness in the end. I taste a little soapiness as well.  M- Medium feel with moderate levels of carbonation.  D/O- It's a classic, but I'm not digging it. This is by no means a bad beer. It's just not for me. Give it a try and decide for yourselves. Cheers.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,adkirkish,4.58,"Appearance: Poured clear amber with a frothy off-white head that persisted throughout.  Aroma: Sweet caramel / toasty and roasty malts, but the hops are most prominent in the aroma, no esthers, no diacetyl. (Guidelines for style note a rustic, woody or minty quality for hops - I could see how the mint is slightly apparent - menthe like, but very subtle).  Flavor: Hop bitterness is forefront - Floral, Bittering, and the menthe on the finish. The malt profile is spot on w/ majority of roasted flavor w/ slight caramel notes. Balance is toward the hop bitterness. Finish is lingering hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Medium throughout (Body, Carbonation, Mouthfeel), no astringency / warmth.  Overall: This beer is legendary, and arguably noted as being the beer that saved craft beer in America. Personally I find it hard to compare to others in the style (Because I haven't had any yet). Will need to do more research on the hop notes as they are the qualities that separate this beer from being a Pale Ale. This beer reminds me of drinking a Pale Ale.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

S: Malted barley and beer. Not much else.  T: Not too crazy about this one, but it's alright. It's light and grainy with an interesting sweet and tangy kick. Aftertaste is lightly dry and vaguely bitter.  M: Feels pretty nice -- carbonated, sweet, with just enough zest to make things interesting.

T - Sweet and fruity with a strong upfront malt profile which fades to a nutty aftertaste infused with a touch of hoppy bitterness.  M - Medium bodied with not too much stickiness or carbonation.

Two and a half fingers of buttery white head rose and dissipated slowly to leave a fluffy spotted lacing and ring around the outside.  Smell: Mmmm. Reminds me of Dave's Foxhead. I thought I smelled some macro corn adjunct at first, but it dissipated to make room for pleasant floral hops, toasted caramel malts, and honey.  Taste: Has a hoppy bite at the beginning, which is surprising and welcome. Toasted caramel malts, honey, and a light citrus zest.  Drinkability: Smooth, creamy, and enjoyable.

Caramel malts with a drop or few of honey.  Taste is decidedly malty with toast and caramel leading the way. Plenty of floral bittering and a little bit of hop flavoring. Yeast is clean, but exhibits a touch of light fruit, maybe some red apples and pears. Freshness is paramount to this as some old Anchor Steam can get pretty hairy. Fresh, it is delightfully pleasant with the refreshing qualities of a lager blending nicely with the subtle complexities an ale yeast has to offer.

Smooth finish with citrus and malt flavors lightly lingering.  D - Had 22oz at the hotel bar and enjoyed every last sip. If I didn't have to be somewhere I would have had another.

28,63,BricksandPorter,3.91,"Poured two cold into the Dortmunder Boot after setting in the fridge over night.  Pour - A clear copper/brown with hues of gold, orange & red. Thick, creamy column of head of pure white. Cap literally took six minutes to fall to a two finger, lacy topper. Effervescent to the very end.  Nose - hoppy aroma with a biscuity/piney undertone. Nothing truly discernible on the nose. Mildly pungent, almost light...  Taste - Fantastic! A malty base that sours on the back end. Very little alcohol, but good hop balance that accentuates the finer notes in the lighter malts - notes of pine, butter, honey, pumpkin and spice. A lighter flavor than I was expecting.  Mouthfeel - medium-full body, mild character but perfectly balanced . The carbonation makes this beer a real sharp finish, despite it's ale flavors. Smooth and very flavorful.  Drinkability - 100% recommend. Anytime, Anywhere - if your a beer drinker, this is a must have/try. Loved it!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Taste, like they advertise, its what, a lager yeast made in an ale or vice versa. Light body, ample hopping for a flagship brew from back in the day. Just the right amount of sweetness. Mouthfeel allows one to pick up some of the complexities and what sets this beer apart from a standard APA. Great summer beer, sometimes a little cost prohibitive, and a well known folklore regarding the dickness of those affiliated with the brewery prevent many from enjoying the finished product more often.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

More distinctive earthy and grainy notes follow, and this brew finishes with a clean, bitter taste.  M - Light to medium-light bodied, with an adequate amount of carbonation. These elements work with the flavors to create a crisp, refreshing feel - very nicely done.  D - I'm not sure that it gets easier to drink than this. If BA had an encyclopedia, Anchor Steam's picture would show up under the listing for session beer.

Tried it while I was in Berkeley for the weekend since it was local and I couldn't remember seeing it in Tacoma (though now that I'm back, I keep seeing it around).  Anyway, couldn't really smell it in the bottle. It tasted fine, pretty much like any ol' somewhat drinkable lager. At first. There was a hot, lingering aftertaste that must be the weird California heat-loving brewing agents which this stuff has been concocted with.  I'd drink it if it were the only thing on hand, but I don't exactly have high praise for this one.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Develops into a toasty, malty flavor towards the back. Leaves a very pleasant, toasty aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Crisp, clean, and quite refreshing.  Drinkability: A classic brew.

It's been some time since Chumley's Passport thing introduced me to the Steam, so I figured I'd give it another go while CK is celebrating Fritz's wonderland of brewy goodness. It pours a clear copper-amber with a thumb of light off-white foam on top. The nose is primarily a humid melange of citrus and floral hoppy goodness, though a bit of medicinal/soapy notes stagnate in the background. Interestingly, the taste runs along these same lines, though the soap is gone, and there is an increased influence coming from the flowery and cirtusy hop elements and a very light twinge of caramel. The body is light, with active carbonation and a crsip, dry finish. It's all pretty straightforward, but nothing all that desirable. Can't fault the drinkability, though, as this guy is light and refreshing enough to warrant constant returns to the Steam room.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Flavors of caramel and malt is nicely balanced with somewhat bitter hops, but hops aren't real noticeable, they simply hold back the sugars and balance everything, providing a kind of dry finish. This is so unique and very good. I love this beer. It is very versitile. By that I mean it is hard to pigeonhole into a category. I think it could satisfy many different style palates. Very well made and a classic in my house. Thanks Wal-Mart for the fresh sixer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Gorgoroth,4.55,"Presentation: Great, uncommon squat brown bottle; awesome retro-like artwork. Looks great next to Anchor's other bottles which all have a similar style.  Appearance: Pours into a generic English pint glass with a clean, deep amber color and vigorous initial carbonation; boasts a massive and dense initial head with cream of wheat color and great retention; leaves lovely spotted lacing.  Smell: Very full aroma boasting notes of sweet malt, caramel, and honey; undertones of raisiny and bready yeast with a slight floral hop backbone.  Taste: Front of mouth is full of hop bitterness and malt, with notes of lemon zest, fresh herbs, honey, grapefruit bitterness and sourness, and orange peel; the aftertaste is complex and bitter with hints of vanilla.  Mouthfeel: Pervasive, tingly carbonation supports a medium body; the finish is full and chewy with a minimal flash of alcohol in the throat.  Drinkability/Final Thoughts: Very drinkable, though rather complex. It definitely deserves its fame as one of America's oldest craft-made brews and at a very reasonable price and high availability, I will definitely be revisiting this beer in the future.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Nose features a big malt hit, not too sweet, great balance with minimal hop presence. Taste is unique to the style quite malt forward with some floral and grassy hop notes muted by big malt bill and lager yeast. Medium mouthfeel, not sticky, decent effervescence. A totally unique drinking experience which highlights the craft in craft brewing, a truly great session beer (as are all the beers in Anchor product line).

Smell: Feint honey-like malt smell, very pleasant  Taste: Smooth honey/caramel-like malt taste, with a health bite of hops lingering in the mouth. Beer also contains a citrus-like note. Light, refreshing, and nice carbonation. Decent balance, though the style is bit sweet for me and the honey/caramel taste of the malt crowds out the other flavors a bit.  Mouthfeel: Not watery, though the beer is fairly light it retains good substance.  Drinkability: Good.  All in all, a very nice beer, and a true classic. Not my favorite style but it defines California Common beer.

A good beer, would definitely have again",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,dasenebler,4.28,"Pours a clear amber hue, with a thick and creamy head. Retention wasn't too great, but the lacing was nice.  Grainy, lager-like aromas with earthy, grassy hops.  Flavor is very nice. Bready, biscuity notes mix with a subtle toasty complexity. Hops are restrained, but definitely there: think earthy, clean bitterness. Probably in the 30 IBU range. This basically tastes like a pilsner with a slightly heavier, perhaps slightly ale-like, malt profile. In the end though, you can definitely taste the lager character, even though it's a warm-fermented lager. Medium-light body, with fine medium carbonation that adds some creaminess. I'm finding this very easy to drink, but also delicious at the same time. As the shining example of our only indigenous style, this beer might be the quintessential American craft session beer.  Anchor Steam is brewed with enough restraint (in both alcohol and flavor) and subtlety to be a highly quaffable beer. Also doesn't hurt to be an American classic.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,Cylinsier,3.83,"bottle  Pours a clear copper gold with a thin white head with okay retention.  Smells malty sweet and lagery.  Taste is about the same. Good barley malt and a hint of hop bitterness that remains subtle.  Feels thin to moderate with light carbonation that sharpens a bit on the back of the tongue.  Very good lager. Not heavy, refreshing, easy to drink, easy to like.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,ADZA,3.48,"Special thanks go out to Adam and Joel for this little number,it pours a light clearish amber hue with nice carbonation that leaves a creamy two finger head and heaps of lacing,the smell is a combination of aromas of maple syrup,light toffee,sweet honey and caramel,it has a pretty lightbodied mouthfeel to it almost close to carbonated water and exudes light tastes of honey,maple syrup and finishes with a dry caramel finish at the end and to be honest i gotta say its quite a bland taste for a brew that i expected and heard so much from and even though its very easy to knock back as a session brew it really doesnt have much substance to it all.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,ManuelHerrera,3.87,"Anchor Steam seems to be a cult favorite among American craft beer fans, and being in that community myself I've actually only recently tried this craft icon.  I have to say the beer is good, but overhyped. Controversial? Probably, but I'll break it down.  Appearance - Golden brown, with quite a fluffy head.  Smell - Sweet, syrupy maple - carmel aroma. Actually quite pleasant.  Taste - Here's where my issue comes in. The flavor is light, refreshing, but also a little bland. The flavor is soapy, with a hint of citrus. I wish the carmel flavors that were so prevalent in the aroma was carried over in the taste, but I honestly couldn't get paste the soapy overtones.  Mouthfeel - Pleasant, lightly carbonated but ultimately very smooth.  Drinkability - I give Anchor Steam credit for being quite refreshing to drink. It's light, smooth, and not challenging to the palate.  Overall it's a solid beer, but all the hype seems a little unfounded. An ""A-"" from the Bros? This is a ""B"" beer in my humble opinion.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,JMad,4.28,"Poured a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  1. Beer poured a light copper amber color, 1 finger head that shrunk into a thin ring after a few sips. left a little lacing on glass.  2. The smell was pleasant. Faint hops and malt scent but nothing stood out much, slightly fruity.  3. This beer has a unique taste, kind of fruity. I can taste some apricot, and a small amount of bitterness lingers after a gulp.  4. Carbonation is not too strong. The beer feels bubbly and light for the flavor.  5. Very drinkable. Almost finished this beer before I even got to the drinkability. It goes down easy, has a great unique flavor.  I didn't know what to expect when I bought this beer, but I am impressed. I would drink this over and over again. Now I'm gonna go pour two of these bad boys in my mug.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Kaiser777,3.48,"Drop the anchor I am ready to get steamed.  A- It is a golden brownish yellow, with little bubbles rising to the top of a solid white foam, witch disappears rather quickly, and leaves a light residue that disappears quickly also.  S- It has a similar smell to most American lagers, with a hint of barley and malt.  T- Just an edge over average I do like the taste, just wasn't blown away by it, but it is very delicious.  MF- Also just above average although it is on the brink of being a 4.  D- I am very impressed by it's drink ability, I could drink this beer all the time, with that said I want to thank all my G's in Cali that steam there beer, west coast in the house!!!!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,KickbacksSteve,4.25,"On tap at the brewery in San Francisco. Poured into a small 6 ounce fluted glass. Learned today that this beer is the only lager that Anchor makes. Also learned the various reasons this beer is called a steam beer and that nobody knows the truth for sure. Scoring bonus points for history, normally wouldn't do that but in some subconcious way, you can taste the history in the glass. A classic.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Shrews629,4.3,"Appearance - Creamy, frothy, two-fingered head that reminds me of the top of a milkshake. Clear burnt orange, almost amber color with red highlights on the side of the glass. Tremendous lacing that really stuck around.  Smell - Picked up the sweet caramel right off the bat, which was very pleasurable, along with some sweet floral hops and a slight herbal or earthy hint in the background.  Taste - Tasted sweet caramel and a bit of pine actually. Bitter aftertaste that stayed on the back of the tongue. Just how I like it.  Mouthfeel - Medium/chewy mouthfeel that was very smooth.  Drinkability - I really like this beer. One of my favorites. Very nice. Another beer that I could drink during any season.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,MICAMD,4.03,"A- A clear orange liquid with numerous streams of carbonation making their way to a thick and creamy bone white head. The head eventually falls to a creamy thin covering.  S- Apples, pears, and caramel. A little simple but fragrant enough and enjoyable.  T- Caramel, apples, and pears. There is a distinct hop bitterness at the end.  M- The bitterness has a nice, crisp bite to it and leaves a lasting dryness.  D- A great, drinkable session beer. Not as sweet as expected- which is a good thing.

28,63,BeerNemesis,4.07,"Anchor Steam Beer | 330 ml. | 4.9% ABV  Brewer: Anchor Brewing Company Style: California Common / Steam Beer Glass: Pint  Presentation: First off, I'm a huge fan of the bottle itself. It's sort of plump, with dark brown glass and an attractive label design. Bottle cap looks great too.  Appearance: Pours a crisp, clear orange-gold. Head is about 1"", rocky and white. Lacing is decent.  Aroma: Earthy malts, caramel, slight floral tinge.  Taste: The bitter hops are really quite intense, but they soon segue into the malty backbone. Hins of lemon and sea salt. Grainy and citrus aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Light bodied but chewy.  Harmony: Great drinkability and harmony on this one. The flavors play together so well.  Price = $5.49 at Winberrie's",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Some really nice lacing is crusted to the glass.  Aroma is earthy, grainy, and lightly musty. Sweet and a little bready.  Flavor follows. Apparently there's a fruity flavor, but I'm not tasting it. Some spicy hops. Nice bitter finish.  Medium bodied, with an appropriate level of carbonation. Really easy drinker. Nothing too exciting, but a true classic.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Believe it or not, this is the first time I've had this beer even thought it's readily available to me in Cincinnati.  It was poured a clear, dark tan with red highlights. The head was nice and stuck around during the duration of the drink.  Mild hoppiness with a moderate amount of malts were on the forefront with this one. A light yeast presence was detected, as well.  Very nice & easy to drink.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,FeDUBBELFIST,3.56,"Bottle to pint glass. Batch # 9S9.  A: A 3 finger large fluffy head deflates rather quickly from its rocky state to a frothy film. The body is the color of polished brass or a twenty year old penny. Very clear and clean looking. There is a small amount of visible carbonation. Spare lacing.  S & T: Malts and hops are of equal, both of average intensity. Toasted malts of caramel, freshly risen dinner rolls and grains. Hops are grassy. This brew has a granulated sugar semi sweetness throughout the palate and mild fruity esters. Decent flavor duration.  M: Medium body mouthfeel and fizzy carbonation. Finishes crisply, aided by a slight dryness and bitterness.  D: Definitely a quality brew and probably great for the style (my frame of reference is lacking) but not exactly thought provoking in my opinion. More interesting to me is the history/process of the style and how Anchor has the trademark rights to the ""Steam Beer"" style.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,CHADMC3,3.98,"A pleasant amber body lies beneath the thin, off-white head upon pour.  The aroma is highlighted by malt and yeast. The malt is sweeter with barley as well.  Very good flavor featuring plenty of malt and barley as well as the hop bitterness the nose was missing as well as certain sweetness resembling either caramel or nut.  Medium to light in body with medium carbonation and all around very smooth.  I suppose this is the benchmark for the style, and quite a good one at that. This is a great beer, very refreshing, crisp, and just enough character, but nothing untraditional.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,TrippnFiasco,4.31,"A: Pours with one-finger, off-white head. Moderate Lacing. Gorgeous rusty/amber color liquid. Minimal head retention, but thin layer remains for quite some time.  S: Above average smell for a lager, slight hoppiness but not getting much else.  T: Initially, nice balanced hoppiness initially with a bit of a bite/mild tartness. Finishes with a nice maltiness, which has a nice roasted quality as the glass gets warmer (was initially served at proper temp though). Slight caramel flavor lingers on the palate between drinks.  M: Nice amount of carbonation (moderate) that adds to the refreshing nature of this beer. Bit of dryness on the finish, but nothing too strong.  D: Very drinkable, could easily have a few of these over the course of an afternoon.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

A: Pours a light amber color with two fingers of off-white head that slowly reduced into a thin film that left moderate lacing after every sip. S: Very dry and grainy. Lots of malty notes, barley, oats, grains and yeast. T: Follows the nose with a big, dry, grainy malty taste. There is some citrus and bitterness from some light hops as well. There is also a kiss of fruity sweetness in the finish and an overall doughy bready taste to the beer from the yeast. M: Very clean feeling. Medium-light body with light carbonation and a super dry finish. Very crisp. D: One of my favorite beers. To me, nothing quite tastes like this one. Highly drinkable and refreshing.

T: clean hops, nice malt backbone, sweet yeasty flavors reminiscent of an ale.  M: Light body, great balance, not overly carbonated.  Very nice beer, hops are light but present as to not overpower the distinct 'steam' taste of the beer, nice malt backbone but once again is well balanced to bring out the fruity yeast flavors not normally found in a lager beer",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,VWBuggirl,3.89,"Very crisp medium brown. Not orange or red at all. There is a thick foamy head that had staying power.  As scent, the malts are strong with light hops. Definitely grainy.  The taste is interesting, I can't say I have ever had anything like this. It is bready, but the taste also has a piney and hoppy quality to it that makes it nice and earthy.  This is easy to drink and fairly refreshing.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,jjanega08,3.68,A= took me too long to try this beer given that it is sort of the orgin of craft beer. Pours a nice amber color with a nice two finger perfect head. The head is a nice off color with awesome retention and lacing. Actually a really nice looking beer.  S= Smells like I would expect. Really nothing amazing about this at all but still somewhat comforting. The smell is a lot of sweet malts in it. The hops aren't as strong as I expected however sort of muted.  T= The taste is similar to the smell. I wanna say it's a little estery without being on the Belgian level. There is a nice sweet malt character to it as well as a small hop finish.  M= Good and crisp in the mouth. Nice carbonation to it.  D= Well Anchor got sold today so I decided to crack this one open... Pretty good beer. Nothing spectacular and amazing but it's the orgin of craft beer. Worth trying for the novelty alone.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,Bouleboubier,3.93,"Drank this out of an 8 oz. highball glass. Surprised and delighted how much this beer reminds me of UK session ales. The flavor is ever so slightly fuller(?) than the average session ale, maybe. The similarities in feel I found were in the smoothness, cask finish, creamy bubbles. Malty all-around and delightful.  Strangely, I imagined that this is what beer from say before prohibition or even, I guess, from the 50's or 60's tasted and looked like (if that makes sense).  Glad I tried this again. Anchor's Christmas Ale this past winter was pretty banging, too. More Anchor it is.  btw - I spent my first 4-5 years of drinking craft brew drinking it out of the bottle and when I finally got enough sense to start pouring it into a glass, a whole new damn world opened up!

A nice citrus scent is detectable as well.  T: Very crisp tasting, not particularly strong tasting in any distinct flavor, but an overall nice taste consisting of citrus and caramel with grains and hops on the back end which mellows out fairly quickly.  M: Very smooth and creamy, again crisp yet refreshing with a medium amount of carbonation making for a somewhat light tasting beer.  D: Very drinkable, this is certainly quite enjoyable and I would definitely have another.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

S - really hard to pick anything significant out - a slight hint of toasty malt lingers in the background, but nothing else I can detect.  T - not a lot up front, but then a slight hoppiness followed by a distinct bitterness. A very slight hint of iron at the end.

28,63,steveh,4.23,"Another old stand by, a good choice from the early days of the craft beer revolution that I turn back to now and again.  A -- Clear, amber with a thick, off-white head that holds up very well and leaves some good lacing as it settles.  S -- Bitter hops up front with some biscuit to nutty malts fighting to balance. Vague citrus esters blending with both hops and malts for that warm-fermented character.  T -- The fruit esters hit first followed by a mix of the biscuit malts and citrus hop character. Finishes with the bitter hops at the back of the mouth and lingering breadiness on the tongue. Even some slight diacetyl with warmth.  M -- Medium body with a mouthfeel that starts soft and finishes crisp.  D -- There's a reason this beer has been around as long as it has, it has a great, complex character, but doesn't overwhelm with too much -- it goes down nicely and leaves you wanting to try more.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

However, I have been thinking about using it when steaming some muscles (Anchor Steamed Muscles amuses me), so I figured it would probably be a good idea to sample the beer alone first.  Pours a copper color with a bit less than a finger of fluffy, off-white head. Head quickly evaporates to a thin covering, but leaves sporadic lacing. Visible carbonation for the duration of the glass.  Smell is minor. Some malts and grains?  Some sweetness. Not quite honey, not quite a fruity lemon, but somewhere between those two. Middle of the taste is somewhat bitter, but then goes back to sweetness briefly. Dry finish, with no real aftertaste.  An interesting beverage. I keep picking it up occasionally, so that says something, doesn't it? I can think of worse ways to spend an afternoon than knocking a few of these back. Will definitely be trying to do Anchor Steamed muscles with it.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Nice but a little weak.  Wheat, cracker, light hops, not-too-sweet malt. Really simple and extremely balanced. Very wheaty aftertaste, along with some hop bitterness.  Nice medium body and carbonation. Pretty great feel for the style.  This is a hugely drinkable beer. Just fresh, clean and simple.

Smell - Malty, fruity - maybe apricot?.. reminds me of tea or something, sort of an herbal smell. Smells healthy. Not my favorite.  Taste - Slightly toasted malt, with a nice hop bitterness. Tastes sorta like a toned down Irish Red, but with a nice freshly toasted barley taste. Delicious.  Mouthfeel - Watery, but respectable.  Drinkability - Very drinkable, I could drink this for hours and stay satisfied, without filling up.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Deep amber in colour.  S - Malty aroma that is, at first, hard to detect. Beyond that some very light notes of honey, apple, and apricot.  T & M - This opens smooth and malty with a very slight hint of honey followed by a hoppy bitterness in the finish that lingers briefly. This is not a rich tasting beer but the flavor is not thin either.

Deep metallic copper color, slight haze only partially disturbs the transparency, lighter orange around the rims.Earthy, minerally nose with its own metallic veneer, apricots and oranges, smidge of caramel and honey glaze, hoppy florality, basically, though, the earthiness its best attribute. Medium-bodied with a big foamy attack that fills your mouth swiftly. This might serve the purpose of disguising some of the bitterness of the grassy hops and sour bread aspects. More minerally here than earthy, like quinine. Apricot, peach, apple fruit match up well with the bitter front, together with the lemon and orange citrus make it a balanced experience. Caramel salves the wounds at the end.

Smells earthy and fruity, a touch of caramel, citurs and kind of biscuity. A little hoppy mainly citrus hops I'd imagine. The taste is really refreshing. Citrus is the main thing I pick up as well as a bit of caramel. Kind of biscuity just like the smell as well. Kind of bitter but not bad, malty but it doesn't overpower anything. Nothing though really jumps out, to me seems pretty balanced and like I mentioned earlier refreshing. Pretty average mouthfeel nothing special there. Overall this one is pretty good. Pretty low ABV so having a few is no problem and I would gladly grab another. Definitely a classic and one of the beers that helped me turn to craft beer.

28,63,brewerburgundy,3.56,"Served in a nonic at Brewskis in Fayetteville, AR and I believe this was a 16oz serving.  Golden and brilliant. I got a pour that's as close as makes no difference to a stadium pour, there's only a fine, soft halo. Even so, this halo is finding a way to cling in a few streaks to the glass.  Not much pop to the nose. Subtle pale 2-row, grain, cracker, and some lemony twang. Very lager-like.  Crisp, palate cleansing, clean. Not having previously had any California Common I was unsure how far they would lean to the light, crisp, fizzy side. This one does. Again citrus, lemon twang accompanied by crisp cracker-like grain. Very little lingers.  Crisp but not over-carbonated, very clean. More weight than a cold fermented lager in the mouth but possibly more cleansing and refreshing than many.  I have finally tried this legend, on-tap no less. I have heard that this is the best way to get your Anchor Steam and someday I'll compare to the bottle. A great alternative to macro for that icy summer drink but I couldn't possibly justify the $12 six-packs here.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Tastes of malty up front, with hops, caramel, yeast, grass, lemon zest, grains and some corn. Medium body with very light carbonation (champagne-like), and a very light, crisp dry finish that's very grainy as it trails off. Only average to just above average flavor, as is the style, but an extremely drinkable beer that went down very easy.  This beer has been steady and enjoyable to me for over 20 years, and while it might not hit the flavor levels of some of the new IPA's on the market, it's still very quenching and smooth. It's a classic, but I must admit that reviewing this beer today has certainly lowered the taste rating a bit since there are so many better tasting beers on the market (IMO) since the time I first drank this ages ago.  2012: Had this again and enjoyed it quite a bit; the flavor is basic, but I'll bump it up a notch due to the extreme craftsmanship involved in making this beer as an American classic.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Nose is an English malt sweetness, apple and grain and some hops spice. Pear tart malts with tobacco and cinnamon hops. Dry finish, lager-like crispness. Tighter and fuller than expected.

28,63,OneDropSoup,4.43,"Poured into a tulip pint: a nice medium amber, clear, under much glistening, large-bubbled head (four fingers on first pour), that sinks a bit but retains a sculptural lumpiness. Bright gold highlights. Had to do 4 pours to get the whole bottle into the glass. Foamy lacing.  Smell is clean but flavorful, with a light caramel aroma & some cereal grains. Slightly toasty, bread crust. Lightly floral, crisp hop notes.  Well-rounded toasty & caramel flavors as well, with enough bitterness from hops to balance out perfectly. Maybe some slight lemon, but not much at all. Finishes clean. Aftertaste goes through a few movements between dry, slightly mineral, sweet, & then resting on toasted. Not a big flavor but really well done, full but restrained.  Light-to-medium body with a slightly dry feel in the aftertaste.  This is so solid. Lower ABV brew, no flares or tricks, just well balanced & very tasty. I tend to overlook this on too often, but when I have it I'm reminded what a great, drinkable brew this is.

28,63,BuckyFresh,3.46,"Appearance: Poured from a bottle into a large wine glass. Pours a nice golden/amber color with a good inch of frothy off-white foam. Pretty thick lacing present; it almost looks as though the head is creeping back up the glass. The beer is nearly clear and there is a good deal of carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass.  Smell: Smell is mostly caramel malt with a touch of yeast. There is also a bit of hop aroma and citrus sweetness. Notwithstanding all that, the smell of this beer is fairly understated. Typical lager aroma.  Taste: Given the mild, malty scent of this beer, I was quite surprised with the amount of bitterness I tasted. The predominant flavor is citrus right off the bat, but it gives way to more of an earthy, grainy finish. Pretty dry on the back-end, and in my personal opinion, the beer lacks a little depth. I know the flavor is unique, and maybe it's the lager fermentation at higher temps, but I found myself wanting a little more of the sweetness I detected in the smell.  Mouthfeel: Medium-light body, with moderate to high carbonation. Fairly dry and crisp, and almost a touch watery.  Drinkability: This is a pretty easy beer to drink, and even though it's pretty bitter, the bite is soft enough that you could down a few of these if you wanted to. Refreshing and decent for a low ABV beer.  I bought this beer because of the unique way in which it is fermented. Maybe my expectations were somewhat askew, but my impressions of this beer are so so.

28,63,Mazda3,3.44,"I wanted to try this as I have often heard it mentioned and thought it would be interesting to try a new style. I did have a bit of indecision as the store carried both this beer and their ale. In the end I got this as it is a rare example of a style not often seen.  The initial pour is good with some head development and a beautiful amber color. Unfortunately the head does not last long and sinks back forming a ring.  The initial taste is very bitter, and it is not a hoppy bitterness, perhaps metallic or vinegary? The mid taste is almost non existent, perhaps due to excessive carbonation.  I hate to say it, but this reminded me of a BMC light beer with more bitterness. The carbonation was on a par with a Michelob Light I tried recently. At least the light beer had no offensive flavors.  I might be being harsh - this beer (according to Wikipedia) is a style that was designed to be cheap and easy to produce and was the choice of those without any money back in pre-prohibition California. For this reason one shouldn't expect it to be the best tasting beer in the world.  This beer improved as it warmed a little, and it was interesting to try a new style. I looked it up here on BA and wanted to like it based on the favorable reviews, but in the end I think it is overrated and I don't think I will be buying this beer again.  [Edit] this beer improved a LOT when taken with some food, even some chips or something. The malt and sweet flavors came through and the bitterness reduced.

What I did get was hoppy more than anything, but not much else.  Though the smell was minimal, the taste was a strong, hop-forward blast. I would best descibe the taste as weedy - not in a bad way - and bitter. Hops definitely the senior partner in this brew, if you ask me. Taking a more deliberate gulp, the upfront bitterness fades into a very pleasant pulse of malty sweetness, which then evaporates back into a bitter, hoppy fade. Interesting.  Well-carbonated and flavorful, the Steam was plenty satsifying. Perhaps a little strong flavor-wise for an extended session, but ABV is within that range. A nice reliable brew for stocking in the fridge and suitable for indoor or outdoor applications!  Raising a glass to the US Junior team, since they are too young to have one themselves. Well done boys, and all in due time.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,kegger22,4.2,"Anchor Steam Beer is amber in color with a half inch, off-white head that reduces to a collar.  The aroma is definitely caramel malt.  The taste is caramel malt again, but there are vaguely bitter hops lurking in the shadows waiting to strike at the after taste.  The mouth feel is medium bodied and well carbonated.  The drinkability is very good, this makes for a great session beer or just to enjoy one by itself.  The bar I was at on New Years Eve was out of my regular and I hadn't had Anchor Steam beer in something like thirty years. So I had three of these straight from the bottle. I loved it and decided to buy a couple of bottles to later sample and review. I have to admit I preferred it straight from the bottle on New Years, although there where no doubt other factors involved. One thing for sure, I won't let another thirty years go by before I enjoy this old friend again.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

A: Amber brown color, awesome head with retention throughout the consumption. Nice lace around the head.  S: Very light wheaty, grassy, fragrant goodness with a little hint of hops in there.  T: Nothing too complex here. The hops is excellent, not too bitter. Getting something green in the finish and the aftertaste is awesome.  Drinkability: A solid, smooth drinking beer.

The ratings pretty much tell all - California Common is generally not a style I would frequent, but it fills an excellent gap in times of need. and this, well.. i'm not sure I could ask for more.  pours a crystal clear golden-amber, bubbles continue to rise and thick foam STAYS very well throughout my drinking experience. great lace.  smell is difficult to describe - very unique and strong, not too deep, but a bit of a musty caramel-toffee.  all the crispness of a summer lager, while maintaining a great snap of light fruits and a nice little hop bite. not getting much of citrus on the hops, but a nice earthy and green flavor, very well balanced, awesome.  In terms of mouthfeel I couldn't ask for more - thick and smooth, yet just thin enough to go down perfect and refreshing,  crisp at the end but not overly biting, aftertaste lingers for just a bit, inviting another taste, and at 4.9%, this is a session if ever there was one.  again, not necessarily my favorite style, but when it comes down to it..

28,63,endincolorado,4.1,"Clear amber with a nice, bubbly, off-white head and decent head retention. Good lace.  Fragrant, sweet caramel malt, some crackery aromas and a light hop-bitterness to balance.  Flavors are also of a crackery malt character with some biscuit followed by a dry crispness and nice balance of citrusy hops. Finish is dry and maybe a bit astringent.  Mouthfeel is light-medium with lots of carbonation.  I hadn't had one of these since before I really started to appreciate craft beer. I knew I'd liked it, but now I'm pretty it's an excellent session beer, and one I'll come back to as a stand-by from now on.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Josievan,3.91,"Appearance: Color is your average copper tint. Head is substantial. What is impressive is the amount of lacing on this sucker. It's like fizzy octopus tentacles climbing up the mug to greet me.  Smell: Malt is prominent, with hops in the background.  Taste: Malty like a good lager. It's bitter while in the mouth, but a sweetness comes through in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Decent body. Well-carbonated.  Drinkability: Definitely a session candidate. Unoffensive, yet flavorful, with a low ABV.  Notes: This was my first steam beer. I guess this makes sense since this is apparently the original steam beer. I know this style combines elements of lagers and ales, but this beer definitely seemed like a hearty lager to me. In particular it seemed similar to an Octoberfest lager, which is not a bad thing at all.

Copper with great clarity and a moderate tan head. Aroma is spicy, bready and crisp with a touch of black pepper. It's very close to a Pilsner. The flavor is dry with toasted malt and a mild bitterness. I haven't had this in a while and I can definitely get the lager characteristics despite warmer fermentation. The consistency is moderate and the carbonation is a bit on the high side.  This is a fun, drinkable session beer.

Malt and earthy, floral hop scents. Taste is much of the same. It's a really nice balance between that initial crisp bite of hops and the not too sweet malt on the back end. Low ABV makes this very sessionable as well.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,craftaholic,3.56,"Appearance: Poured from a chubby little 12 oz into a perfect pint. The hue was a crystal clear tangerine with strands of carbonation throughout like a zesty soda. The head was a thick 2 inch frothy soap scum of a head.  Smell: The aroma is filled with grains and bready malts as well as just touches of hop. There is a surprisingly undertone of fresh apple and raisins as well.  Taste: This brew screams grains and earthy tones like grass and floral chrysanthemum. There is some peppery spice and zest in this one but nothing overpowers the grain.  Mouthfeel: It was quite light bodied but yet very fluffy. The aftertaste was very dry and had a crisp hop character.  Drinkability: Looking for a tasty and non extreme, good ol american craft then this one fits the bill at a ""session brew"" standard.  Overall: I wasn't really sure what to expect with this one but it is definitely quenching. There isnt a distinct and unique flavor but rather a melody of grain that is traditional and non offensive.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

The retention is maintained by tons of effervescence seen through a clear goldenrod colored lager. As a result there is thick lacing all the way down.  S- Not much in the nose. No hop presence. Just some grain. Your typical beer smell...  T- Smooth, crisp and grainy with a touch of tea. Nothing amazing but very well composed.  M- Sharp, crisp and highly carbonated.  D- Highly drinkable.

Taste brings what the scent dictated with the multigrain bread and earthy and floral hops up front but with a presence of carmel and fruit in the background. The only knock is the presence of a faint metallic and sulfry taste on the finnish. Medium bodied, fully carbonated.

It smells of sweet, caramel malt. Some bready scents as well. The aroma is balanced out with some nice hop scents.  T. It is a good beer. Hard to describe. A very good combination of malt flavors and hop bite. It has a bready flavor but isn't too sweet. I like it.  M. This beer had a crisp finish. Very high carbonation and just enough bitterness. A pretty dry finish.  D. This beer is extremely drinkable. It goes down easy. Low alcohol makes this a very sessionable beer.

S- Crackerlike malt, ripe fruit (yellow raisin, banana, and gala apples), and some vinous notes appear on the nose... yet no detectable hop aroma...  T- Clean and crisp with moderate crackerlike malt flavor and some restrained fruitiness. The hops just *barely* emerge in the finish as a mild bitterness.  M- Medium body. Well attenuated, yet with a little viscocity to it. The carbonation is so soft it is almost impereceptible.  D- OH YEAH.

28,63,zoso493,3.73,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a nonic.  Appearance: Pours a nice honey amber with just exactly the right amount of head to fill my pint glass. Actually, there's some honey sitting right next to the glass, and the colors are almost indistinguishable. The head fizzles and pops a bit as it makes its way down the glass, leaving some lacing on its way. Looks a touch too translucent for me, though.  Smell: Pretty nondescript scent. There are some faint traces of sweet malts and even fainter traces of grassy hops. I'm also picking up some grains and maybe even some hay somewhere in the background. You really have to strain to get much out of the nose.  Taste: Tastes of light, earthy hops with a stronger (stronger than the hops I mean) malt backbone. The finish is quite drawn out on the malts, I think. I can see now that this beer may be more popular because of the uniqueness of its style than the taste, which is fine by me.  Mouthfeel: On the thinner side of things with a medium amount of carbonation. The aftertaste may last a bit too long, as well.  Drinkabillty: Drinkability is pretty high. Really light beer with a low ABV that you could definitely make a session of, if need be.  Overall, a solid and unique beer. As I'm in Scotland at the moment, I have my reservations about the freshness of this beer, so I hope I can try it again stateside.

Would have been a perfect 5 had it not been for some large chucks of what appears to be sediment, since I'm under the impression this isn't bottle conditioned.  Smell is mostly sweet malt, not much else and seems rather one noted.  Taste is also controlled by the sweet malt but has a slight floral bitterness in the aftertaste, the mouthfeel is quite creamy which is rather surprising but pleasant.

S-Herbal and spicy with a bit of sweet toasty malt underneath.  T-Starts with a slight hint of herbal hop with a bit of black pepper spice, which goes quickly to a full-blown earthy, spicy hoppiness, accompanied by an assertive bitterness. Malt presence is crisp and relatively dry, with a biscuity, bready aspect. Finishes bitter and dry.  M-Medium-light body, spurned on by the hop bitterness. Carbonation is moderate-level, almost moderate-high, but it goes pretty nicely with this brews character.

The beer has a rather pleasant smell after opening the bottle and pouring the beer in a (Bavaria) glass.  The beer has a copper color and the head sticks on the glass. First taste is a bit caramel or hop.  Enjoyed the beer really even when this is not my type of beer.  At the end the head began to taste a bit chemical. I have this same problem with Heineken.

T: Complex malts with qualities of caramel, oak and toasted grain hit first. Spicy hops dominate the middle with flavors of lemon and pepper. Hops give way to a dry finish with only a small amount of lingering bitterness. There's a very faint metallic flavor in the background. A well balanced beer overall.  M: Medium body with the right amount of carbonation. Somewhat dry.  D: Excellent. A true classic that provided one of my earliest exposures to craft beers back in the 90's.

Neck label offers a narrative highlighting style and history and a description of the brew. Does not show date of bottling, and notes an all barley composition, but not Alc. by Vol. Poured at a bar into a bulbous. but not quite tulip, glass.  A - Pale amber color with a generous head that shows little retention and shrinks to faint lacing and a thin surface memory.  S - Light smell with a bit of bready malty and a remote fruity note with a fain hoppy sense.  T - Light malty sweetness with a nice soft bitter note.  M - Light body with generous carbonation that works well for the style.  D - It´s a nice go-to beer in the absence of more exciting options and certainly on another level altogether than most macro choices. For a light refreshing beer with a cogent and respectable character this is highly drinkable.  Notes: It is a good brew and is a pleasure to have it around. But style purity and all, there isn´t much to rave about. It´s pleasant to be had but much of the hype and claim to originality pivots around how it represents steam beers, which in fact and thanks to them is legally a void style since they trademarked the term and all other brewers are legally banned from using the definition commercially. The fact that thanks to them beers of this particular craft have to be called ""California Common"" after they appropriated a piece of shared culture does not raise much sympathy from me and certainly does not add to the drinking experience.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Lacing is impressive but not the best ive ever seen. This head will not die, and seems to form a thick, solid entity all its own. Never seen anything like it Colour is an appetizing orangish-gold, perhaps goldenrod if you've ever seen the flower. Lots of little carbonation bubbles coming up to the top.  Smell: Not an incredibly strong smell from this one, so its very difficult to really say much. Smells flowerey, hoppy. Not much else can be detected  Taste: Oh wow. The taste. This is where the beer shines. Its quite hoppy and a little bitter, but with something else that is hard to describe. Theres some sort of bitter taste like a type of nuttiness, but a nuttiness completely unlike belgian yeast. It could be described as almost pecan-like. There is some sort of hops that I'm not familiar with (but I do like it).  Mouthfeel: Smooth, nice amount of carbonation. No bad aftertastes. Head is so creamy in your mouth; it becomes a quasi-solid conglomeration of foam. No boozy warmth, but a lot of refreshment.

Earthy hops and sweet malt with a long lingering mild hop bitterness in the finish. Medium body, creamy mouthfeel, crisp carbonation. I drank a lot of this beer in the mid nineties it was somewhat of a gateway beer for me. Delicious in its simplicity, yet interesting enough for my ever changing palette. Great session beer!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,MrStark,3.28,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a nonic pint glass.  Appearance is a mostly clear amber orange with a one-finger off white head. Pretty good retention.  Smell is of slightly sweet malts and a little bit of hops. A mild hint of spice.  Taste is similar to the smell. Hops are present as well as the malts. A mild amount of bitterness, almost reminds me of an APA.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Fairly creamy.  Drinkability is good. It goes down pretty easy and has a nice taste. I'd have a few more but its not something I'd go crazy for.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,dcxxray,4.51,"This beer is one of the most unique lagers. I've never seen a beer with better head than this beer. It doesn't have a strong smell. As far as drinkability goes, you can drink this beer pretty much anywhere.

28,63,mightymoksha,4.22,"Served in pint glass.  Pours a translucent, dark amber, with a rich, off-white head. Mild retention and lacing.  Clean, earthy aroma, with hints of toffee and raw pecans.  First up is a soft hop bitterness, followed by a clean, mild malty sweetness and notes of lemon and very faint caramel. The latter become more prominent in the dry, prickly aftertaste.  Full-bodied mouthfeel and moderate carbonation make this beer very pleasant on the palate.  Very drinkable. When suggesting new beers for friends unfamiliar with craft brews, this guy is one of the first on the list.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,bonkers,4.1,"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours a clear copper with a long lasting 2 finger white head. The aroma is earthy, bready with a bit of sweetness.

A great all around beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,BeerCon5,4.35,"Pours a hazy/cloudy dark amber color, with thick off-white bubbly head.  The scent is mostly of caramel malts.

28,63,MunchkinDrinker,3.45,"A - Slightly hazy light amber. Fizzy white head that fades quickly. No lacing. Some carbonation is present.  S - Baked bread aroma with a mildly spicy citrusy hop overtone. Nice, but very mild.  T/M - This is where it loses me. Hops hit, but leave no flavor. Malts are mildly sweet, but not compelling. Mouthfeel is at least clean.  D - Fair drinkability. It's standard beer. Nothing special in my book.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,flagmantho,3.83,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: completely transparent with a nice golden hue; head is giant, white and tenacious.  Smell: smell is subtle but interesting; getting a nice fruity maltiness.  Taste: very dry malt flavor with a hint of graininess. Hops are floral in character and sparing in presence, but overall it's a pretty good effect. I can't put my finger on it, but this beer really reminds me of autumn.  Mouthfeel: body is light side of medium and there is a tiny bit of an astringent quality which is interesting.  Drinkability: this is a very interesting beer to me which I like because it is different. I think it would pair great with something unctuous like salmon or fried whitefish.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,RomaniIteDomum,4.12,"On a trip to San Francisco I drank quite a bit of this stuff from the hotel bar. I'd had it in the bottles at home a few times before, but this is just so much better off tap. Needless to say I saw pleasantly surprised when I fould this on tap locally at Mr. Dunderbak's.  Pours a nice amber color with a nice head that leaves some nice lacing.  Smells like nice malts with a bit of hops thrown in there.  The taste is much like the smell, lots of sweet maltiness with a little bitter bite at the end.  This beer goes down very smooth. It is fairly creamy with a nice balance.  Very drinkable, one of my favorite tap offerings. This keg traveled particularly well.

28,63,bsp77,3.68,"Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Summit Pint glass.  Appearance: Clear amber with relatively thin head but expansive lacing.  Smell: Caramel, biscuit, toast and some earthiness.  Taste: Earthy, toasty malt that has a semi-sweet caramel middle before ending with a strong earthy bitterness that is almost too much for this particular beer. Somehow it doesn't come together as well as it should in terms of malts vs. hops.  Feel: Moderately high carbonation (almost fizzy), medium body, dry finish.  Drinkability: Obviously a very important beer in craft beer history that is quite good but is ultimately more relevant for its history. Nice to have every once in a while.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Little lacing.  The nose is really unique. It has the sharp freshness of a lager, but also a touch of sweetness like a belgian. Light toastiness in the nose, with a drop of honey like sweetness or two.  The flavor is really unique. I really like this. Nice bitterness, with a touch of toasty flavor. Again, there's almost a belgian quality to this beer. I've never had anything like it.  Feels great going down, and i could drink these forever.

Smell...nicely balanced yeast and malt, with a little bit of fruity hops.  Taste.. a bit hoppy, more so than in the aroma. Malty, slightly bitter...a good sort of bitter  Mouth feel.. medium carbonation. Thin to medium body.  This is a unique beer. I'm not much of a lager fan, but then other lagers are really nothing like this.

Smell is the weakest aspect of this beer though, weak smell, can pick up malts, some hops and a pretty solid lager smell, nothing special but not bad in the least. Taste is good, great malt backbone to this one with a finish of some hoppy bitterness, overall a great lagery solid flavor. Mouthfeel is medium and a bit creamy, coats the mouth with a good aftertaste that leaves you wanting more. Drinkability is huge here, could get a keg of this and be very very happy, doesn't fill you up and the taste seems like it would not fade away after many of these.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

I got a Tulip glass, and poured it in. Light transparent amber color with a lively carbonation and a white head. No lacing.  The nose is not much different from any macro I've had, but there is a stronger bitterness than those and just slightly more substance.  The taste isn't anything special, a light malt backbone and a light hop bitterness. Do I detect some derivative of citrus flavor?  I've said it before, and I'll say it again. I don't like over carbonated beers. This is one. I don't like the sharp Sprite-like bite in your through from too much carbonation. Drinkability is ok.  Not something I would order again, but glad I got a chance to try this legend of a beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,burnerfinger,3.88,": Appearance poured from the 12 oz into a clear mug. nice orange-amber color - firm looking head settled without too much lacing. carbonation bubbles can be seen thru the clear brew.  S: Smell - not much aroma here maybe just a hint of a clean scent, I really can't put a name to it.(does that imply good balance? maybe)  T: nicely balanced but severly understated. can't really define WHAT is going on here. but then as the beer warms, the bitter hops taste really comes out front. not bad.  Mouthfeel - heavy carbonation - nice flavor that does not really scream out of any specific taste, but I like it nonetheless.  D: Very drinkable. At 4.9 it's got more than a bit of a punch, but the alcohol is well disguised. nice drinker here.

28,63,MaxBrews,4.03,"Presentation: 12 oz uniquely shaped anchor bottle  Appearance: Nice 2 finger head which dissipates into a very soapy lacing. Color is amber. The beer is clear and the bubbles would suggest it is full of carbonation. Lacing clings to glass wonderfully.  Smell: Big malt character can be smelled from affair, when your nose zooms in you also get citrusy and floral hop that combined with the malt create a fresh and clean aroma.  Taste & Mouthfeel: A big malty character balanced a very floral and dark fruit taste. A bit of a citrus twang from the hops, that allows for a slightly but dry finnish. A tiny bit of bitterness from the hops but nothing overwhelming. A medium body and is a very filling beer.  Drinkability: a good clean all rounded lager. Very drinkable, its a very malty beer but avoids tasting cereal. Provides a good contrast with Dark fruit & citrus flavors and aromas. One of the most flavorful lagers I've had.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Crimefish22,4.4,"A- Pours a golden/amber hue with about a two-finger eggshell colored head. The head quickly dissapates and there is very little lace retention.  S- Malty with a faint twinge of hops toward the end. Earthy but sweet, the malt dominates the nose.  T- Malt up front with a welcome bite of hops in the finish. Bready and balanced. A palate pleaser. It loses some flavor as it warms but not enough to hurt its rating.  M- Medium body with crisp carbonation. Very refreshing.  D- Easily sessionable, the drinkability is the most dangerous weapon in Anchor Steam's arsenal.  Tasty and refreshing, Anchor Steam is simply a versatile, sturdy craft beer. You could pair it with just about anything, in my opinion.

T: Was looking for more citrus flavor to balance out the more-pronounced-than-expected hoppiness, but then again, this is California Common, not Pale Ale. A good representative of the style.

(S)- Flowery lemon with honeyed corn meal  (T)- Hoppy dryness with a considerable malt backbone of honeyed corn.  (M)- Solid carbonation with a superb balance of bitter/sweet influences.  (D)- A fine beer that I would gladly choose over M/C/B.

The color is stark amber with some deeper browns toward the middle and lighter orange and carmel colors at the edges.  Not getting much of anything from the nose... there is no smell.  Pungent flavors of light but defined malts. There's a bread taste that's balanced out with tinges of citrus. It's a medium bodied beer that makes its mark on the edges. It's very well balanced. The selling point is the back end for me, a toasted flavor that sits just long enough.  Anchor's Steam is all about texture. It has a very pleasant mix of frothy and creamy, but not overly so.

Codes are better than nothing, for I suppose they can be decoded. Single purchased at local health food store for $1.59.  A-Poured a medium amber hue with a 2+ finger head and modest lacing. Overall, a nice looking beer in the glass.  S-What smell? If I had been wearing a blindfold, I would have only recognized it as ""beer."" Non-descript.  T-I'm still waiting for this. Someone, please let me know the secret to discerning this beer's taste. But a 12 oz. bottle for nostalgia's sake is all I am willing to grant this offering. Very disappointing. Mostly earthy malts and bitterness. Can't quite tell if bitterness from hops or the modest alcohol. Not very well crafted.  M-Excellent mouthfeel. Exceedingly smooth and well balanced carbonation. This and the appearance are quite good. Too bad taste accounts for 40% of the rating.  D-This went down very easily, but I wouldn't readily reach for another. Taste just isn't there, and there are much more affordable alternatives available for getting a buzz, not that I was looking to this beer for, but presently I can't see much other use for this. Sad.  Not sure about what the California Common/Steam Beer style is all about. This beer makes me want to suggest a new style: enigma. This is a craft beer icon, but it has no taste. Thankfully, it is not yellow. I want to like this beer. It is probably one of the first craft beers I recall having at an excellent hole-in-the-wall pizzeria in Sausalito, CA while on my honeymoon 26 August's ago. Not even close to the caliber of Anchor Liberty or Anchor Porter. I am flummoxed, and disappointed.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,PerroGrande,4.28,"Appearance: Anchor steam pours to a beautiful deep golden color with prodigious, rich foam. The head endures nicely adhering nicely to the sides of the glass.  Smell: I picked up some nice malt and caramel overtones, along with some hops. There were some citrus hints hanging around ever so slightly on the periphery, but I couldn't isolate what they were.  Taste: Anchor Steam is on the bitter side of center, but certainly isn't off-putting to one who isn't a big hops or IPA fan. It represents a nice compromise point in a number of ways. The opening is mildly bitter with hops overtones, but follows with an interesting malty, caramel taste with hints of sweetness in the background. The finish is long and pleasing with a nice mix of hops and malt hanging around for a long time. I find the taste and finish of this beer very pleasing.  Mouthfeel: Less creamy than the glorious foam would indicate, but certainly acceptable.  Drinkability: Outstanding. Very refreshing. Would be a nice session beer, good in both cold and warm weather, and a complement to numerous foods.  Until tonight, it had been a few years since I had an Anchor Steam, and I'm reminded again of how much I enjoy this beer.

28,63,DAVIDMAGNUM,4.8,"To start with I am an Ale fan. I have never found a Dunkel I could tolerate and most good Lagers are ok ( to me) if there is nothing else and I am thirsty for beer. But this stuff...wow! A warmer fermenting Lager, darker and cloudier than a Lager, is this a hybrid? An Ale like Lager? A cloudy dark yellow/light amber pour that brings out a thick long lasting head. Lacing and retention. Gluten proteins clinging on baby!! No rice, no corn, this looks like it is going to be BEER !! Smell is fantastic - sweat and inviting - bitter and alluring, smells like a Lager ought to taste Mouth feel is very good, no artificial carbonation burn/bubble, just enough natural action to make the feel part of the experience. Taste is what it's all about and this beer is all about it. A very good balance of sweat and bitter. A very slight citrus after taste, just enough and I mean just a touch to let me know it is there. Alot of American brews use Cascade hops that taste like sour squash and this beer avoids that strong ""citrus"" punch. Good with food, good as a session beer and complex enough to be a good slow night cap after a long day in the salt mines.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Body is a very nice copper color, and slightly hazy.  S: Interesting... seems to be some caramel in there, along with some citrus (orange? lemon?)... light hops in the aroma as well. Quite pleasant.  T: Definitely as interesting as the smell... not quite like anything I've had before. Again, the caramel comes out at first, but then it finishes slightly bitter and dry. I can still detect the citrus in there as well, and maybe some herbs/spices.  M: Medium-bodied and thin-textured, but still some slight creaminess coming in as well. Good carbonation.

28,63,albern,4.34,"After nearly 1200 previous reviews, what more could be added. This is an old standby and I'm surprised that after reviewing over 800 beers I forgot this old favorite. It pours a nice clear amber color with a soft off white, slightly creamy head, some retention, not much lacing. The nose is toffee, crystal malt, cracked grain, some fruitiness once the beer settles. Right out of the bottle, this is olde English toffee and caramel if there ever was one. As the beer settles there is a strong, very interesting, green grass herbal aroma that is very unique. Wow, that is a first, but you have to let the beer settle in to get there.  This has a very nice taste, very smooth, very creamy, low carbonation beer, lots of semi sweet caramel, lots of toffee flavor, some saltene cracker dryness as well. There is a cracked grain appeal to the beer, an herbalness, and a leafy hop bite in the finish that dries things out just right. This is a fairly complex beer, more than I remember it, but than again, most beers are more complex when you sit down and do a review in the right setting. The mouthfeel is slightly drying and there is a cracked grain dryness in the aftertaste balanced out by some sweetish malts. Very interesting beer for sure.

It's just a neat looking little beer.  After a hard pour it comes out a caramel shade of amber with a billowy, bubbly chunky head. The head looks simply amazing. The lacing is good.  I'm getting a whiff of acetaldehyde, like sliced green apples, in the nose, metal, very fresh and clean with hints of freshly mown grass and caramel that simply begs you to press the glass to your lips.  Taste is earthy, woody and bitter right from the get-go, metallic hops in the middle, with a bit of astringency at play. The malt is sweet, toasted bread and definitely caramel. It finishes dry and the bitterness clings to your tongue and hangs on for dear life.  This was one of a handful of gateways beers that opened my eyes to what beer could be some time ago but, whereas just about all of the others now leave me wanting, Anchor Steam Beer is every bit as flavorful and satisfying as it ever was.

Taste has a fair amount of sweet caramel malt at first with a small note of toasted grain there as well in the background. At the backend, there's a small bitterness that rounds the beer out but doesn't come close to the maltiness. I seem to remember this as a more hoppy beer than this, but as it is it seemed more like an EPA than anything to be quite honest. Interesting. I'll have to have it again sometime.  Tasty, though. Very easy to put down.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Smooth as heck and leaves a malty but dry aftertaste that makes me want to drink more and drink faster. It's a good thing.

28,63,gory4d,4.1,"This was my everyday beer when I lived in the Bay Area. It's hard to get it as fresh in NYC, but it's great anyway. Pours a clear amber with a huge white head, leaving just a little lacing down the glass. The smell is mineral and fruity at once, with some floral notes. The taste is clean minerals, a floral middle, with a bitter finish. It's moderately carbonated, with a simple, mid-weight body.

28,63,indiapaleale,3.8,"Pours a dark orange sort of light amber color with a very big fluffy white head. Man, that is a thick layer of foam on top of this beer...  Smell is caramelized malt, brown sugar, molasses, honey and a bit of ivory soap (not sure if I am crazy but I do get a bit of that smell from this).  Tastes like a sweet amber lager. That is my initial reaction. Its clean and crisp and has a very good malt profile with decent carbonation. The California Common/Steam Beer style is hard for me to differentiate tastewise from most common Amber Ales or Amber Lagers. Its a pretty straight forward beer with no really highlights other than the fact that its extremely drinkable.  I like Anchor's Steam Beer but its not something I'd buy all the time. Its a true testament that different can be good and a great reason why the Anchor Brewery is one of the proud father's of the American Craft brewing movement.

T: Bready malt. A beer that tastes a lot. Floralhops as well as bitterhops. Fruity (apple & citrus). Dry in the aftertaste, but still sweet. A well balanced taste and aftertaste - a nice mix of malt and hops.  M: A nice tingle at first - great carbonation. Medium bodied. A bit creamy. Smooth.  D: Great beer to go with sturdy home cooking.

28,63,Arbitrator,4.17,"Chilled bottle into a glass.  A: Pours an orange body with slight copper tones against the light. Has a dense, creamy-looking off-white head. The retention is decent (several minutes), and it recedes into a line of bubbles on top of the brew, continually refreshed by carbonation up the glass. Some lacing down the sides.  S: Caramel and biscuit malt are strongest, but there is a subdued hop component underneath. I smell leafy hops, some earth, and citrus.  T: Lemony citrus comes out first, against expectations. It is followed by biscuit, then caramel in the mid-taste. It becomes earthier in the finish, with a slight leafy hop component. Finishes dry and lightly bitter. Still manages a sweet aftertaste with a citrus tinge, like eating lightly flavored lemon biscuits.  M: Good carbonation, but not crisp or containing a bite. Fairly smooth, and medium-bodied.  D: Does a session beer have to be under 4%? I'd say this is a good candidate otherwise. It has a great flavor, but without being so strong that it induces palate fatigue. Easy to have a few of these and enjoy each one. Still, the flavor is not so great that I'll pick this up very often, which compromises the score a bit.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Nice clean finish with a touch of yeast and earthiness. Fairly carbonated, nice and crisp.  A very good beer, nice balance between sweetness and bitterness.

Carbonation looks pretty lively. Lookin forward to this one.  Smell: Mint, leafy hops, sweet wood (hickory?), and spice. Sweet malts throughout, but some nice, spicy, leafy hops level things out.  Taste: This is a new found love for me. I've had Anchor Steam many times in the past and never remeber it being this good. The same aromas detected in the nose come to life in the taste; mint leaves, grain, and spicy hops steal the show. Citrus can also be found, expecially toward the end. Delicious, balanced, and totally unique. This is a must try.  Mouthfeel: Genrously carbonated (as are most of Anchor's beers), very creamy, and uber smooth. A sturdy malt backbonve gives the imbiber something to chew on. Finishes crisp with some light bitterness.  Drinkability: I'll be buying this again, and again, and again.

Pours a lighter amber color with a terrible head that quickly disappeared and left no signs for its existance. The aroma was very basic with no specific smells. The taste was similar. There were no distinct flavors, mild hoppiness and malt. Felt light but had no redeeming features.

Aroma is quite unique several things going on citrus and earthy notes from the hops, caramel and some grainy notes, the yeast gives interesting esters as well as a sulfer character. The initial sip is impacted by a sharp crisp bitterness and carbonation that relinquishes to more caramel and ceral flavors from the malt.

The smell is exceptionally clean with big hints of malt, barley, and hops. The taste is the perfect amount of carbonation coupled with an ever so slightly bitter hoppiness & a nice, dry finish.

One thing that I can say about this beer is that it is very balanced. The sweet malt and floral hop flavors complement each other very well. The smoothness of the beer is unparalleled among those I have tried. Considering that I am hard pressed to find any harsh or unpleasing flavors in the beer, I could drink this all night.  The only flaw with this beer is that it lacks any big flavors that immediately jump out.

Beer is a deep amber/copper color, while the head follows suit but much lighter with a copper-tinged beige. Mouth-watering.  Smells rich and earthy.  Earthy taste with some bitterness, followed by a light honey (or perhaps caramel) sweetness. The bitterness dominates, but in a rich, earthy way.  Mouthfeel is also rich and syrupy, good carbonation but no bite per se.  High drinkability!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,diabecktic,4.3,"Appearance: A lovely pour. Thick, creamy head (~2 fingers) forms slowly and stays in place - lacing is excellent. The beer is a very light shade of amber and orange; there is plenty of visible, rising carbonation.  Smell: The aroma is composed mainly of hop and grain tones, but there is a subtle underlying sweetness. I can't quite describe it accurately, but it seems to be something of a mix between caramel and citrus tones with a hint of bubblegum. It's a very sharp scent.  Taste: The first thing I noticed was the extreme bitterness. Hop and grain character are immense in the first portion of the tasting; the caramel tone acts as a bridge to the citrusy aftertaste. I would say that the taste matches the nose fairly well. As the beer warms, the balance between hoppiness and maltiness becomes a bit more distinct. When cooler, the malt tends to be masked.  Mouthfeel: I would rate the body as medium. It's a little heavier than I would have thought, but it's just right. For all of its bitterness, it's really not too sharp on the palate.  Drinkability: This is a very ""lively"" beer, but it's pretty smooth overall. I think this would make an excellent session beer. It tastes great and goes down well regardless of how it's served. Just don't drink it too quickly because you will miss out on an other-wordly experience.  Summary: I'm suprised that this wasn't my first choice when I first looked to try an Anchor beer (I had the Liberty Ale in Denver last summer). This is truly a unique beer in nearly every facet subjected to this review. The balance and quality of flavor are unlike many other beers that I have sampled and it's easy to drink; this beer is put together very well. If you haven't tried this before, please do yourself a favor and get a 6-pack as soon as you can.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

It poured a medium-dark brown color and it tastes a few steps above Yuengling. I tasted a mild fruitiness in the after taste, which makes it a unique lager to me. I wanted to go back for more, but the bar was too crowded. It is a light lager which makes it easier to enjoy.

28,63,mullenite,3.97,"In to a Sam Smith imperial pint glass.  Pours a crystal clear amber in color with a tall (3+finger) bubbly and slightly off-white head that goes down a little bit quickly and doesn't leave too much in the way of lacing down the glass. The head settles to leave somewhat of a cap on the top. There is some visible carbonation coming up from the bottom but not a whole lot.  A slight pine hop to the nose backed up by some sugary sweetness (molasses, honey, flowers).  Taste has a bready maltiness to it followed by just the slightest bit of bitterness from the hops and leaving a dry finish. None of the sweetness from the nose really makes it through save for a little bit on tip of the tongue after the biscuit flavor subsides.  This beer is on the lighter side of having a medium body, the carbonation is a little zingy but overall compliments the weight well.  A good sessionable beer with it's low alcohol and lighter taste.

Fruity esters, nice splash of citrus and caramel like malt in the nose. Very unique. First thing that comes to mind when drinking this is an IPA without the strong citrus rhine bitterness. The earthy, herbal hops are still pronounced but balance out very nicely with the fruity, clean biscuity and buttery malt aspect of the beer. Mouthfeel is clean and crisp that finishes off dry and very refreshing. Decently priced down here in Halifax, I could definately see this being a session beer for me.

Some pine undertones to it. Overall, very well-balanced, in my opinion. It has got enough sweetness, bitterness, and a nice bite to it.  M- Medium-bodied. Very effervescent, which is a good thing in this case, as it adds to the crispness of the beer.  D- Very drinkable.

Appearance: The beer pours a dark amber or copper color with an off-white full head (about 1"") that lasts a reasonably long time and leaves rings of lacing.  Smell: The aroma is of sweet malt with fresh, floral and mild hops.  Taste: The flavor is malty with some dry hop bitterness following along. There is a very nice balance here between malt and grassy, floral hops.  Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is on the low side of medium bodied and the carbonation persists. There is a long finish which ends in dry bitterness.  Drinkability: I'd say this is a good solid beer for drinkability.

28,63,Gosox8787,3.63,"Decided to pick up a six pack of this classic since I had never had it before. Never had this style before, so I was pretty excited to crack one of these open. Poured from the bottle into a glass. There was a two finger, pillowy, white head with decent retention. Beer was clear with a nice light brown color. The smell is all malt. Caramel and molasses notes dominate the palate. Very little presence from the hops on the nose. Flavor is also centered around the malt. Caramel notes provide a nice sweetness to the brew, which is countered by the sour note of the yeast. A touch of hops also add another layer. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with only a little carbonation. Drinkability is high due to the low ABV and the light flavor.  Overall, a tasty beer that is definitely unique. A great choice for a session brew due to the flavor and ABV.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,biboergosum,4,"355ml bottle. A rather specific style, to be certain, and nice to find at a friend's birthday party at an above average local pool hall.  This beer pours a clear, glassy medium copper hue, with two fingers of puffy, densely foamy, and somewhat creamy white head, which leaves some decent iceberg profile lace around the glass as it slowly recedes.  It smells of bready, kind of biscuity grainy malt, softly tangy pome fruit, a hint of yeastiness, and earthy, leafy, and faintly grassy hops. The taste is slightly biscuity, sour toasted grainy malt, tame citrus rind, lemongrass, subtle pitted fruit, and a mixed tea leaf bitterness that takes some of air out of the sails of the otherwise sassy bitter noble hops.  The carbonation is on the low side, with a hollow reminder of earlier exploits, the body a fairly solid middleweight, and duly smooth, with a not-so-subtle flirtation with creaminess. It finishes well off-dry, the kind of sourdough-like (maybe it's the San Fran on my mind) graininess parrying the lingering fruitiness well enough.  While not exactly comparable to its heady Cali brethren in the hop department, one shouldn't overlook the simple drinkability of this more reserved beer - malty, fruity, and yet duly balanced in a near-perfect old-world manner. Sure, no tastebuds will be burst here, but that's not always the aim - pleasing structure has its merits.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,ThatWineGuy,3.58,"Half finger off white head diminished to a cloudy, wispy surface with a few large bubbles hanging around, moderate carbonation. Bronze and orange colour. There was a gentle scent, fruity on opening, then floral; with air and warming, took on an earthy nose. Taste was very earthy hops, bitter with a malty follow through. This reminded me of a very work horse type of brew - steady, reliable but nothing in particular aside from a strong malt composition distinguished it. Honest and down to earth beer none the less mostly characterized by its malty core; a wee bit filling for my tastes.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Leaves a nice lace.  Smell - Citrus hops, malt, and bread.  Taste - malt and hops balance each other nicely. Starts bitter, finishes somewhat sweet.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied and creamy. The carbonation is just right.  Drinkability - Extremely drinkable. One of my favorite session beers.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

T- The taste is very crisp and clean, with a slight malt tone. The carbonation adds to the crispness. Nice bitterness that does not take over the taste. At the end a pleasant dry finish comes about.

There is some fruitiness here, but it mostly sticks to the style that it's made famous.  T: In addition to what was in the nose, some bready flavors.  M: Good creaminess and medium body. Moderate carbonation.

28,63,BrewsCrewSA,3.73,"I really dig Anchor's Liberty Ale, so I thought I'd give this one a spin.  A - Pours a deep copper color, very tawny. Off-white head that dissolves after two or three minutes, but dosn't leave much else.  S - A little confusing. Smells hopppy, but as I discovered later on, tastes malty. Surely, the biscuits are in the oven in regards to the malt character, but I was really expecting the ""assertive hop bitternesss"".  T - Malty, biscuit characters present right up front. Not very complex but still interesting to pick it apart. Actually, I think I would've enjoyed this beer more had I not vested so much thought into it.  M - I'm just getting a little lazy now. It feels very light on the tongue. Not at all heavy or complex.  D - Sure. You could put a bunch of these down to impress yuppie friends.

Taste is mildly bready, with a decent malt profile. Not much hops here but enough to provide a decent balance with the malt so that the beer is not too sweet. Mouth feel is smooth with decent carbonation.  A good beer although not a style that excites me too much.

It's got just a little bit of malt sweetness upfront balanced with a light hoppy bitterness that gets bigger around the finish, and a little bit of a weird funk that if pressed to describe I would call 'clover.'  M: Smooth, not too watery, not too thick or heavy.  D: This is a beer for drinking. Not sipping, not evaluating -- drinking.

I cannot say I would classify the Anchor Steam as a ""hoppy beer"", but is quite tasty nevertheless. It has the smooth front-end of a Pilsner, with the complex (and almost confusing!) back-end of a pale ale. Incredibly drinkable, leaves the drinker craving another! Typically, I prefer a beer that hits the total of the palette, but this beer is an excellent example of its style. Top-fermented. A good ""lazy sunday"" beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,Andreji,4.12,"Revisiting Anchor steam as my first in this easter's american beer tour has been an absolute joy for me.  Staying at my dad's appt, when he mentioned 'i've got a beer in the back of the fridge' i hardly imagined it was this, which has been lying around for a year or so.  But in perfect shape.  Pour was amber with a nice glow to it and a crescent light tan head with lots of lacing and carbonation (Even after the lenght of storage).  Smell a balanced sweet hoppy feel with a soft grass-citrus feel, not too strong or overpowered by any of the elements.  Taste was quite unlike what it once was for me. this is not a robust overhopped beer but much rather a fabulous balance malty experience with a well rounded hoppy feel much more subtle than i remembered. mouthfeel is quite refreshing, well carbonated and the bitter finish dissipates fairly quickly.  alcohol is well hidden and doesn't really kill you after a couple.  overall a very commendable beer. i can find myself drinking this often.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,JBogan,4.15,"Anchor Steam was the first craft beer I ever drank, many years ago. It had been a while since I'd had my last one, but I decided to pick some up yesterday and revisit an old friend.  Nice looking dark gold with a white one finger head which left moderate lacing.  Smelled of malt, maybe a bit of caramel and mild hops.  Tasted like the smell. Nicely balanced and refreshing.  Thick and smooth mouthfeel with good tingle. Very nice.  This one's been around a long time and it's still one of the better session beers out there.

28,63,Weizenmensch,4.15,"Purchased in Japan, best before 2009&#24180;6&#26376;.  Deep amber to pinkish-red in colour with a rocky off-white head and thick, crystalline lacing. Lacing is unusually intact, must have a high protein content. Carbonation uniform with fine-medium bubbles.  Aromas of rusty iron, autumny ale hops and dried stone fruit. Enticing, perhaps served even a little cold, it would open up more at higher temperatures.  Bitter on the roof of the mouth but a satisfying sweetness lingers in spite of this. Sweetness is not overpowering though, and the acidity of the carbonation is also noticeable. Stone fruit on the palate, peach and plum, as well as a rusty hop fruitiness. Satisfying but appropriately balanced - this is still a beer for a hot day, in spite of its flavoursome, slightly astringent hops.  Mouthfeel is dry but not unpleasant, however this sample has a slight skunkiness - not overpowering at all, just a lingering sense of not-quite-fresh that is noticeable. Probably just the sample, it would be undoubtedly better enjoyed in California.  In spite of this, I wish I had bought more than one bottle of this. A good beer for all seasons, except perhaps the depths of winter (although it would be a good session beer following some heavier, meatier brews).  Overall, better than I remember, even though I remember it being good. I'll seek out this one again (not least considering its history and importance) and hope to try their other creations someday.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Kromes,3.88,"Poured a golden color with thick head and good lacing down the glass. The scent was of sweet malts. Flavor was of creamy malt and bitter hop.

S: I little hop aroma that blends nicely with the malt aroma.  T: Restrained bitter hops and sweet pale malts. Great balance between the two. Kinda salty. It's like and IPA and a lager at the same time.  M: Very creamy in mouthfeel, more than you would expect given the color. Quite smooth, to boot.

I'm gonna have to say my review's the same for tap and the bottle. I only got a tiny difference in a cleaner nose on tap. A- A nice deep hazy amber gold color. The head is pretty nice and leaves good lacing. S- Clean on the nose with earthy smells. Malt and a light hops presence and lightly sweet. T- Very similar to the smell with hops and grains more up front. Maybe a little more yeast and more malt in the finish than expected. I actually got slightly more hops in the finish from the tap.

A bit astringent, a bit acidic with some notes of lemon skin on the aftertaste. Mild carbonation and excellent drinkability.

Subtle and subdued, but clean and definitely appealing.  Taste is clean and equally pleasing but in a different direction. Malty and sweet up front, with some caramel and honey notes quickly giving way to a pleasant neutral green bitterness that stays through the finish. Bitterness is almost a bit much at times for the flavor profiles.  Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, nicely carbonated and all around a solid feel.  Definitely a good go-to beer.

28,63,biegaman,4,"Copper tinted gold with the a very toasty complexion. Despite a deep set haze the beer is transparent, dotted only with steady paced streams of ascending carbonation. Its topping is thick and creamy, persistent and adhering. Its markings appear like some ancient scripture.  Steam beer (or 'California Common' as other examples must legally be referred as) is slightly more distinctive than other styles of standard ales. It smells no more exciting but it's an aroma specific to the style. It's a very earthy, pungently hoppy smell with an unexpected lack of caramel given the deep hue in its colour.  The flavour also makes explicit that you aren't drinking a typical ale. It's distinctive without anything obviously distinct about it. The flavour is quite toasty. I taste a bit of toffee and light apple. The character is quite grainy and dry. The hops again have a pronounced character and linger along with the crisp malty flavor.  This method of fermentation uses a significant strain of lager yeast, one that developed over the years in the cool, ambient temperatures of the San Francisco Bay area. It's a lager yeast fermented at typically ale temperatures - no wonder the beer is so distinctive!  The most common explanation for where Anchor Steam took its name is said to come from the steam that would rise from the large, shallow open 'coolships' that were traditionally used in the American West before the introduction of refrigeration.  San Fransisco is an amazing place. It's home to a founding brewery of the American craft beer movement as well as one of the world's most reputable and highly revered beer bars. If you do visit the city (which you should) and wish to visit the Anchor brewery (which you should) than I recommend that you make reservations way ahead of time; it's a popular spot.  I'm not sure if Americans cherish Anchor Brewing as much as I do. I am certain, however, that I can't be speaking solely for myself when I say that finding Anchor beer on the shelves was one of the pivotal turning points in my beer drinking life.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

The head is nice...thick, creamy, foamy with pretty nice retention. The smell is both earthy and sweet with a malty tone. Citrus and hops detectable. Taste is true to smell with perhaps a slightly stronger malt. Hops bitterness is present but the balance makes it work as with all good brews. A pretty complex mix of flavors and feel. Slight astringency doesn't take much away. The finish is crisp and clean with a sharp hops tone left on the back of the tongue.

Some fruity scents-- sometimes citrus, sometimes grape. One more aroma I can't put my finger on-- vanilla, maybe?  Initially more malty, with a not-too-bitter hop finish  Feels substantial, partly due to carbonation, partly to flavors.  Very nice, easy to drink beer.

The aroma is wonderful, sweet malts and fruity hops. Very crisp smelling. I get a small amount of citrus as well. The taste is also exceptional. Mild carbonation tingles the back of the tongue while the hops dance on the front. A nice malty backbone provides a nice platform for all of this.

Pretty good amount of carbonation visually present. Good lacing.  Smells similar to a pilsner/lager, but just much stronger on the nose and seemingly much cleaner. Quality ingredients. Some mild grassy hops, mild yeast and gently sweet malts balance quite well.  Still very well balanced and clean tasting ingredients.

It pours into a pint glass with a copper orange color and nice thick white head. Very good clarity and head retention. Very good lacing left behind.  Aroma is a little unusual with a sweet, bread-like quality and just a touch of hoppiness.  Flavor is biscuity and bitter with a surprisingly dry finish. More hoppy than I would've expected with dominant grass and spice and more mild fruits.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation, bitter and dry as I mentioned.  Drinkability is pretty good as it seems crisp and clean like a good summer beer. I haven't had a California common other than this so it's hard to compare.

My stepdad introduced me to it in San Luis Obispo while we downed a few along with some oyster shooters.  This evening I poured my Anchor Steam Beer from its beautifully labeled short-neck bottle into a tall, narrow German glass beer mug and the head was tall and rocky and stayed with the beer almost all the way down.  I too can detect fruit flavors along the line of cantaloupe-rounded flavors-that compliment the carmelized sugars present in the maltiness.  I also taste the perfectly balanced presence of hops, both in bitterness and flavor(ness?)...these flavors seem to be almost painted on to my upper palate and the back of my throat--making these areas feel sort of 'numb'- while the rounded fruit and malt flavors show up on the front half of my tongue.  I find Anchor Steam Beer to be delicious and very well balanced. They've done a great job of combining the classic beer flavors of bitter and sweet and even managed to seperate the places within my mouth where these flavors appear.  When I buy Anchor Steam Beer I feel like I've done something good. Thank you Fritz Maytag and your 'posse' for putting together such a wonderful product and sticking with it.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,LyonsHead,4.23,"12 oz bottle in a glass  A: Deep amber. Not what I expected. I've never had steam beer before (i guess the name lends itself to a watery sounding lite beer). Very creamy head  S: citrusy notes  T: Well-carbonated beer gives it a sharper taste. very fruity with almost plum like notes. not a very hoppy beer.  M: medium-body, very smooth  D: this goes down real smooth and finishes well Over all its Nothing like what I expected it to be. I am very glad I didn't judge the beer by the ""steam beer"" cover. steam beer so far is great! I definately recommend this beer!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,krunchie,4.28,"I've actually had several Anchor Steam before, but this time I was totally shocked by the extraordinary taste. It's the first time I'm reviewing it, so I probably focus more this time.  Served in a pint glass at 53,4°F.  A: Golden yellow/orange, clear beer. A LOT of CO2! Many fine little bubbles in there, one of the best carbonated beers I've seen. Fluffy head (yellowish), which seems to stay in there quite ok, but the head on mine was gone by the end of the review.  S: A little honeyish. Some light malts too, not very much hops. Sweet, a bit citrusy  T: Mmm! Sweet and lovely CO2. A little caramelly. Very fruity, mango, cantaloupe and pear comes to mind. Perfectly balanced bitterness, not much hops here either (but it's there). Very unique flavor, it's lovely! I'm really fascinated by the sweet fruitiness of this beer.  M: Thick and fluffy, yet smooth and light on the throat. Too bad the head didn't stay airy and bubbly for that long  D: Very drinkable, thanks to the perfect bitterness and the amount of CO2. The fruity flavors are absolutely stunning, making you crave for more!  Conclusion: Nice bitterness and CO2. Citrusy and malty nose. Very fruity flavor with hints of mango, cantaloupe and pear. Fluffy head which doesn't stay airy for too long, but definitely drinkable with a thick, smooth mouthfeel. Very satisfying and doesn't demand much from the drinker. Absolutely brilliant",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Pretty interesting brew, leaves a bitterness on the back of my mouth, which normally turns me off to a beer, but its not off putting to me in this one. This has a unique flavor. Has an earthy flavor to it with light citrus notes. but due to the bitterness, i probably couldnt drink more than 2 of these in a setting.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,TheFightfan1,3.95,Poured into a pint glass.Pours a cloudy light amber color with white frothy heading. A citrus hop smell is immediate and slight touch of caramel. Taste is very light and crisp with lemon also a nice bread-like maltiness with a very hoppy finish. Very little lacing but it is an awesome tasting beer very easy to drink.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,CityBoy1986,4,"Poured into a pint glass from a 12 oz. bottle.  The pour is a golden colour with a large white head. Retention and lacing are decent.  The nose is made of sweet fruits, some yeast, a little citrus and some metallic aroma. The taste starts with the sweetness, then there is more of a bready flavour. The saltiness and slight bitterness kick in with the bread and lead to a dry finish. It's definitely unique.  The mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a large amount of carbonation. Drinkability is good; I could easily have another.  This unique beer is worthy of a try, and it will be one for me to drink every few months or so.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,WalrusJockey,3.98,"12oz poured into Celebrator glass.  Appearance- strong, clear, golden color, with a white head.  Smell- malty, bready smell. Faint hint of hops or spice, but mostly a bready malt aroma.  Taste- sweet, with a strong malt profile, balanced by a reasonable amount of hops. Not a California ""decent amount,"" but enough to balance the malt without overpowering it. Swallow is clean, aftertaste is water and a hint of hops.  Mouthfeel- mouth weight is well balance. Texture is a bit thin, and swallow is a bit rough, considering the low ABV, and smooth flavors. Over all, though, nice.  Drinkability- very good. This beer would play a strong company to any leisure activity, or to a good many meals, while also being enjoyable all on its own. Solid contender for ""go to lager,"" is you are looking for one.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,ThePeskyDingo,3.96,"My first beer review on here - so bare with me. I really like this beer. I now get it pretty regularly when I am looking to enjoy a beer with a good taste. I usually just enjoy this beer from the bottle, smells pretty good.

28,63,beerkittycat,2.19,"Note: this beer is waaaay better on tap, especially closer to San Francisco. Having said that, this bottle product's appearance is slightly hazy amber with ruby highlights and a frothy off-white head. Aroma, oh boy, has some issues. Vegetal hits my right away with smells of cook asparagus. Behind that was a decent malt profile of toasted grains and some caramel. No hop aroma. Flavor has some more asparagus, wet paper cardboard, and the same malt profile behind all that such as in the aroma. Medium hop bitterness but barely any trace of Northern Brewer hop which is the highlight of this style. My conclusion is that this was from old stock because the hop aroma and flavor had completely faded and the oxidation, but there are some brewing issues there, too, that produced the vegetal issues. I've had this beer at the brewery and there it was absolutely delicious. Shame that there's packaging issues.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,sillyswa,4.14,"A glowing deep clear amber, overcast with a nice amount of white head however doesn't stick. Smell of caramel malts, light floral hops and light citrus perhaps grapefruits.

It is a little tart yet sweet.... Nicely balanced.  M: Highly carbonated, medium to light bodied, and pretty smooth upfront with a little hoppyness and bit at the end... the after taste is a little bitter but not bad.

Tastes strongly of caramel with some roasted malt, some citrus notes and a strange bite in the aftertaste.  Medium bodied and medium carbonation. An interesting beer to try but not as great as I was lead to believe. I'm not sure what it was but at times this tasted a little stale...it actually came in a plastic amber bottle so maybe that affected it in some way.

A: Pours a bold copper color with a two finger off-white head that has pretty good retention and becomes a bit chunky after it begins to dissipate. There's a bit of lacing to be found but nothing special.  S: Strong scent, smells like sour malts with noticeable hops and a bit of fruit.  T: Odd malt flavor, with a bit of grapefruit and a bitter hop finish.  M: Good amount of carbonation makes this a very crisp beer that's still a bit on the thick side.  D: Pretty drinkable beer, it's quite pretty inexpensive which makes it even easier to drink a few.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Jayli,3.88,"This beer pours a nice amber/orange color with about an inch of white bubbly head. Head fades relatively quickly but leaves thin lacing on the glass. Scents of citrus fruit seem to blend very well with the hops and malt. The taste is equally as balanced as the aroma. Initial taste was of sweet malt, followed by some citrus, finished off by a nice bitterness of hops. Lighter bodied beer that I could definitely sit with for a session!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Some malty notes but citrusy, crisp aromas are more pleasing to the nose. Taste is creamier than expected; balanced with grains, and citrus hops left behind. Medium body, carbonated well.

Smell is oddly weak, I get a light fruity scent, too light to pinpoint. This gets a bit better as the drink warms, but never shows any strong characteristics.  Taste is interesting with a (very light) minty hop flavor. Hops become more pronounced in the aftertaste, but by no means is this a hop bomb. Very balanced.

Slight notes of sweetness, but this is overcome by a macro lager-type sour cooked vegetable smell.  Taste: Interesting. Bready malts go down smoothly to reveal a long-lasting hop bitterness. Hops just will not dissipate; they leave quite a memorable bite.

28,63,mdcrouser,3.95,"A light caramel orange glows stunningly, nearly enlightening the entire room, capped by a pretty lively white head.  Sparks of carbonation jump around the mouth like metal dragging on concrete - subtle and slow at first, but building to a quickly burning mild fire of hops-laden happiness.  It all quickly smoothes, with hints of orange peel-, woody-, and hazelnut-tinged hops serving as an overlay to a light mouthful of malt.  Simply enjoyable and wholly delightful - a good place to drop anchor for awhile.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Pours a foggy copper with thick white foam and smells of strong earthy hops and sweet malts. It's extremely flavorful. Carmelly malts perfected balanced by a complex fruitiness and powerful hoppiness. Medium body is well carbonated and crackles on the tongue. A hauntingly long finish that leaves you to contemplate just what exactly hit your palate. Highly recommended.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Not a whole lot of aromas, but those detected are predominately sweet malt, caramel, with an earthy quality to it.  A lot of grains coming through, very multi-grain-like in flavor, despite that there is a prominent bitterness in the beer, which actually took me off guard. Leaves a sweet flavor on the tongue, yet a lot of residual bitterness as well. Quite unique.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

I waited until the glass got closer to room temp before I poured. Pours a deep gold with a nice rocky 2-finger head. Smells sweet with a touch of hop twang.  Nice crisp mouthfeel aides the drinkability, yet this is a smooth beer. A little mellow on the taste, but I'm tasting some corny mealy taste, with a slight hop bite on the finish.

S - A slightly sharp citrus / hop smell with a hint of light malt. T - A clean tasting beer, like a light Pale Ale but smoother, those larger yeasts did their work. The hoppyness at the end is mild and pleasant. Clean keeps coming to mind as I drink this beer, the light malt taste is clean. M - Very light with good carbonation. D - Highly drinkable beer.

S: Odd aroma that must be common amongst steam beers. Smells like wet grains with a tad of sweet malt. There's also this wet, steamy, metallic scent that reminds me of a gym steam room.  T: Fairly malty taste, bit of tangy fruit. Finish is slightly bitter and grainy from the touch of hops. This taste lingers afterwards.  D: Malty-thick medium body with moderate amounts of carbonation.  M: Not one of the more popular styles, but I picked up a 6-pack because my entire beer cellar consists of mostly heavy, high octane beers. I was searching for something lighter and different and this does the trick.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

That said, I'm finding it hard to review this, It has been one of those beers that I compare other beers to.  Golden in color, fluffy head if you pour hard enough, but it fades fast. Smells like malt, grass, some caramel. Crisp clean tasting more grass/hay some kind of earthy hop. Highly carbonated can be a little too much at times, but on a hot summer day its great.

Very fresh aroma with a nice floral hit that makes your mouth water.  Grain takes a back seat to the hops on the flavor profile. The hops are nice and make this a very entertaining beer. Spicy and floral, they give a nice flavor with the mild grain flavor. I kinda wish there were more grain to this one, it would be perfect.  Good refreshing beer, makes me want to have another.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

The taste is so well balanced while still being flavourful. Creamy grainy caramel malts begin. Biscuity and buttered bread come to mind. Short bread cookies. The taste moves into a mildly bitter hop profile which is quite floral with hints of citrus (grapefruit). The finish is bitter and pretty dry with an aftertaste of grapefruits and orange peels.

28,63,cvfish,4.1,"A - This beer poured a cloudy amber color that produced a fluffy white head that did retain well and produced a nice lacing around the side glass  S - The aromas in this beer was more complex than I expected, caramel, mixed with melon and citrus  T -The tastes starts with a good caramel malts flavor, followed by a fruity mix of orange and melons, followed by some hoppy bitterness  M - This body had good feel, medium body, very crisp, and some moderate carbonation to top it off  D - This Steam Beer was great, it is good to see this hybrid flagship of the Anchor Beer is as great as billed, making this a very sessionable beer",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Vendetta,3,"Original Rating Date: July 26, 2008  Solid but unspectacular beer. Good nose, mouthfeel is good, flavor is a bit bland but crisp and refreshing without tasting too watery.

Balanced beer, but I probably won't try it again.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Taste: Toasted malt with a dusty floral hops and a hint of citrus. Mouthfeel: is slightly astringent but overall a good mouth coating. Drinkability: I would drink it again.

I ended up enjoying this beer.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,magictrokini,2.58,"Pours amber with a medium white head. Corny, bready aroma with a fair amount of malt. Astringent metal and bread dough taste that has been watered down.

28,63,tmoneyba,3.68,Bottle on 03/01/2005.  Poured a dark reddish color with medium frothy white head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Aroma has malt and sweet tone. Medium balanced flavor is much the same as the aroma with medium sweet and hop finish of moderate duration.  My expectations where met.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,LordofTime25,3.23,Beer pours to a deep tan color with a thin head.  A light malt hop and malt aromma. More hops than malts present.  Has a hint of hops and some good flavor slighty above average.  Light and airy with little carbonation.  A pretty average beer in my book nothing special!,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,glid02,3.68,"Got this as a single from Green's on Ponce in Atlanta.  Pours a clear copper color with a one-finger white head. The head sticks around for a while before dissipating into a wispy layer of bubbles on top and a medium-sized ring around the glass. Lacing is decent.  Smells of a kind of sour, earthy malt - more earthy than sour - with citrus hop aromas that also are slightly sour.  Tastes of caramel malt joined by a very light sourness. Ends with a light amount of bitterness and the caramel malt flavors linger after the sip is over.  Mouthfeel is good. Good carbonation and good thickness make this one go down smoothly.  Drinkability is good. I'm not sure how many of these I could have, but one went down just fine.  Overall this is an interesting beer that reminds me of another I've had that I can't put my finger on. The taste is very distinct and certainly worth a try if you haven't had it already.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Slynger,3.7,"Pours a lightly hazed, lightly ambered orange color with a lid of fine off-white bubbles.  Comes through bready, with a light pale sweetness, and gentle fruity overtone. A touch of floral/earthy hops and lightly bitter in a dry finish. Medium bodied soft, fuzzy carb.

Notes from 11/21/07",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,ghostwalker,3.71,"Reddish gold body with a finger of white head. A very rich and robust appearance for a lighter, quenching craft beer choice.  Nose is sour graininess. Different.  Flavor is also different than any other brew, IMHO. Grainy up front, a sour and light bitterness on the finish. Not so much hoppiness as palate cleanser. A good balanced brew with a unique flavor blend.  Mouthfeel is cleansing and smooth.  Drinkability is very high. Always a favorite with food. It's high availability on the West Coast makes it one that I go to often when traveling on business.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,nick76,3.62,"Legendary beer with a taste to match. The aroma is yeasty and sour with bread like malt and hops. This beer is clean tasting with a floral hop and has the distinct California Common taste. I believe that for this beer ""less is more."" It's not complex but it's good. Try this one with sour dough and beef stew. It seems to match with them well.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

A moderate brew, nothing too challenging.

S: Soft, pleasing malts with a buttery scent. Sweet, lemony aromas detected in there, as well.  T: A very pleasant, soft fruit flavour and modest citrus from the hops. Otherwise, toasty malts and a bit of a buttery note.  M + D: A very nice, approachable, and certainly sessionable beer. A great, full flavour and medium body with just the right carbonation.

28,63,Mosstrooper,4.63,"Poured from 12oz bottle into my Guinness tulip pint glass.  Appearance: Deep amber color with a beautiful foamy head.  Smell: A toasty smell with an almost buttery hint about it. Slight spicy hoppiness about it. Very pleasing aroma, but might take a couple tries to sense it well.  Taste: A toasty flavor and a buttery finish- expected from the smell. A nice hop bitterness about it that balances things out very well.  Mouthfeel: Good body, not too thick or thin. Carbonation is hard to detect right off, but it is definitely not flat.  Drinkability: If I was told that this is the only beer I would be allowed to drink for the rest of my life, I think I would be ok with that.  This is a beer I had been looking for for a while now and I happened to stumble upon it at a Kroger in Roanoke, VA.

S: Aroma is light and is mainly of lightly toasted grain, light sulfur notes, and a noble spicy, bitter hops component  T: Plenty of toasted cereal grain huskiness with less prominent spicy hops component, probably from Hersbrucker  M: Smooth, light in body, with active carbonation and husk aftertaste.  D: The bottle version allows better temperature control and thus better appreciation of the malty complexity.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

An aroma of malts, with some hops, but not very much aroma overall. A bitter taste, maltiness, and some sourness. Not very fizzy. Eh.

28,63,TheycallmeTim,4.1,"Poured from what appears to be a Miller Lite bottle from 1982 into a pint glass.  A--Two finger foamy white head that dissipated quickly and left no lacing. Body was a lovely caramel amber, little more brown than copper.  S--Deep caramel malt followed immediately by sweetish floral notes. Great nose on this beer.  T--Nutty with more sweet malt notes, but the finish is superior. You get that deep lager feel when you start but when you finish the buoyancy of the hops is /pronounced/. Such a fresh aftertaste without being overblown. Wow. A solid American creation full of biscuity notes that somehow coalesce with a more piney hop pull.  M&D--Enh on the mouthfeel--a bit biting and rocky, not as chewy as I would expect, but not in the least watery, either. The drinkability is unreal--I noticed one advocate reviewed this out of a can. If I could get cans of this and California dreaming weather you'd have me setting sail for the western skies in no time. Glad I finally got to taste this banjo of a beer--i.e. a uniquely American contribution to the realm.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,PhxHorn,3.03,"I used to like this beer, but I bought a bottle yesterday and it didn't impress. Color was a weak copper, with no head, no lacing. Smelled mildly of malt, and taste was the problem. Malt, a bit of caramel, and a trace of vinegary aftertaste that ruined the whole experience. I made it through the glass, but really didn't enjoy it.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,nrpellegrini,3.65,"Pours a orange brown color with a thin white head that fades fast. Smells sweet and alcoholic, sweet malts in there somewhere.

28,63,MasterSki,3.59,"I've seen this beer around quite a bit in Chicago, but I've never bothered to pick it up. A friend brought over a few bottles so I figured I'd give it a shot.  Not sure how old this bottle is - it has 8LW punched in the back.  A - Very handsome beer with a rich amber color. Tons of head and carbonation - it's hypnotic watching all the bubbles.  S - Fairly understated smell - mostly malt, with some some hoppy bitterness.  T - Tastes like it smells, but with more presence. Hits you with some malty biscuit flavor at first, but leaves you with a citrus aftertaste.  M - Creamy and just the right amount of carbonation. Goes down easy.  D - I could definitely put back a few of these on a hot summer day.  This is a solid, but largely unexceptional brew. I might pick up a sixer if it was on sale, but there are a ton of equally priced brews that I like more.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,superdedooperboy,4.1,"Served up at Aroma's Coffee and Wine Bar in Augusta, GA.  Pours a gorgeous copper-amber with a half-finger off-white head that lasts briefly and leaves behind a trace of lace. (Of note, the head retention and lacing was most likely affected by the presence of water in the glass after having just been cleaned.)  Invitingly sweet, floral fragrance fills the nose.  Medium-bodied with a fairly bright zing of carbonation. Flavors of caramel-toffee malts up front and a bit of sweet fruitiness, middling with a mildly herbal hop bitterness and finishing long with a balanced bitter-sweetness.  Refreshing and highly sessionable. Quite a superb session beer, with the overt qualities of an ale and the underlying crisp, refreshing nature of a lager. An outstanding classic.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,John_M,4.1,"On tap at the Detroit airport yesterday. Have had this beer many, many times... high time I reviewed it.  The beer pours the expected light amber brown color with good head retention and lacing. I don't get a lot on the nose, just a hint of malt and hops (it's been my experience that most airports tend to serve their beer excessively cold and with too much CO2, which I'm sure affects the aroma). On the palate, the famous anchor steam flavor. There is nothing else quite like it. The beer has a fascinating malty flavor, but with a huge presence of drying hoppiness. There is almost a peppery finish on the palate, and somehow this beer manages to taste a bit sweet and malty, yet dry and bitter, at the same time. Mouthfeel is pretty light, but the amount of flavor in this low abv. beer is nothing short of astounding.  Truly a classic. Nothing else quite like it. As excellent and intriguing today as it was 30 some years ago when I first tried it.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,cswhitehorse,4.11,"The Anchor Steam was from a dream as it was one of the first micro's along with Rogue's we took in, in the early 90's in the Oregon valley.  It was a good looking brew with an amber color and a 1-2 finger foam head with some wintery lacing. The aroma was malty with a fruity smell. The taste was creamy and bitter from the get go and had a caramel apple finish. The mouth feel was well carbonated and left some fruity bitterness on the tongue and back of the throat. Overall this is one that needs to be bought more often.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Ralphus,4.33,"Anchor's Steam Beer, whether they know what the term steam means or not, is good beer. It shares qualities of its hoppier cousin Liberty but is easier to drink from the start. My sample was purchased at the LCBO, the best before date some 18 months away.  Liberty pours beautifully. A rich golden brown colour with a creamy three finger head. It simply looks good, matching the prototypes of great looking beer in your mind. The head recedes in time but it leaves behind wonderful lacing for you to remember it by. The first smells have welcome hints of vanilla, fruitiness and hops. The taste is full of a complex mix of fruit, malts, creaminess all topped off with a respectable hoppy finish. The mouthfeel is silky smooth but lacking a little in carbonation.  Overall Steam is a real treat. Pick it up and enjoy.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,josiahschlender,4.28,"I've seen Anchor Steam on the shelves for a while now and been curious. Maybe even tried one a while back, but finally saw it on sale and got a sixer to give it a full try. I will be honest, the standard price point here in Portland is a bit higher than I prefer to pay.  Wow, great looks. Beautiful amber luster, with a fluffy pastel orange-white head that lasts and lasts, leaving lots of lacing.  Lots of good aromas going on. Floral, grassy hops, and substantial malts in the vein of caramel and buttered biscuits. Maybe even a bit of yeasty fruit.  Flavors are also ample and complex. Great malt profile that builds on the aromas that is expertly balanced by grassy hops. Nice adequate bittering. Definitely enough hops to let you know they're there, but not enough to drown out the other players. The long finish trades back and forth between bready malts and bitter hops. I love the complex, long lasting flavors. More than I expected in this beer that I see everywhere. Mouthfeel is velvety and medium-full bodied, complimenting the mouthfilling flavors well.  This is a great beer! It will probably not be long before I pick up more. Its balanced flavors make it very versatile when pairing it with food. I enjoyed it thoroughly with Lebanese food, aged white cheddar mac and cheese and more. My drinkability score is hurt a bit by its usual price of nearly ten bucks a sixer around here. When it's on sale, it's a great bargain for a fabulous beer. Plus, it's a lager! Props to Anchor for crafting a classic, out of the box brew.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

An old musky and funky aroma. Not the good kind like in a saison, but old and wet cloths (if that makes sense). T: Malty with some light citrus flavors. Well balances with a nice hop bitterness. M/D: A medium body that is well carbonated with a light creaminess. Though a bit watery almost thin. This is very smooth and easy to drink. An easy choice for a session beer.

I may have had an old one. But after trying a six-pack of it, now I know why people love this brew. You can really taste the combination of Ale and Lager. It has that citrus taste of an ale, yet that taste and carbonation of a pilsner. Nice hop bitterness at the end. Great beer!  M: Carbonation, but not too much that it becomes annoying.

Dark copper, it has a fairly big, off-white, head that lasts fairly long and makes good lace.  The aroma is pleasant and fairly full-bodied, if a tad muted. It's somewhat fruity with a sdtrong maltiness of toasted, yeasty bread, a caramel, and citrus.  The taste is similar, being restrained but flavourful and fairly full-bodied.

It was like trying it again for the first time. Beautiful orange amber in the glass with a healthy (almost decadent) head of foam that lingered through the first few sips and laced the glass. Malty nose, but the initial taste was a nice balanced malt and (fruity?) hops that added a whole bunch of tastes to the mix. Not cloying, not too bitter, and definitely very drinkable.

Head develops yeasty muffin tunnels and has staying power;, when it finally dissipates the lacing is a little austere.  For the look and sizzle of this the nose doesn't necessarily deliver a lot of steak. Mild malt character with a little hop pine and a smidge of sliage. Carbonation makes malt quite clean, though.  Tight taste with a little metallic bite in there. Hop character is slight and grassy. Malt is much more faint on the palate than on the nose. Slight off-taste on the finish.  Too earthy on the palate. Hop bittterness is backed up by decent grain texture. Slight tinny aftertaste.  This is a decent mid-major. It's clean and doesn't drink too badly - better than most.

28,63,ChainGangGuy,3.53,"12 oz. bottle purchased at Total Wine in Kennesaw, Georgia.  Appearance: Pours an orangey-amber body with an inch of frothy, white head.  Smell: Mild caramel, bready malts with a savory spicy, peppery note and teensy weensy hint of berry fruitiness.  Taste: Lightly bready, lightly caramel-coated maltiness. Not much sweetness. Tiniest bit of fruit -- watch out or you'll miss it. Tiny touch of acidity. Spicy, peppery hops, maybe a small pinch of lemon zest, too. Medium-low bitterness. Finishes dry and quite crisp.  Mouthfeel: Medium-thin body. Medium carbonation.  Drinkability: Paired quite well with the film Karate Kid playing in the background.

A gentle scent with no aspect overwhelming another.  More of the same as the nose with a stronger honey and fruit scent. Again, soft flickers of flavor that are enjoyable, but faint. The finish is underwhelming and lacks definition as the flavor just thins out and drifts away. Hop bitterness doesn't provide the proper leverage to balance this one out.  Mouthfeel is medium with an ample dose of carbonation. Very drinkable beer that I could find myself enjoying several.

28,63,RodBurg,4.1,I finally tried this classic at a buddy's birthday party this past weekend. Had on tap at Milano Pizza in San Francisco. Poured a nice amber color with an off white head. Nice lacing.  Smells like toasty malt and bread with a good citrus hop hit.  Taste is very well balanced. Bready malt and hops in harmonious accord. It's a beautiful thing. Finishes with a slight hop bite. This one is extremely drinkable.

28,63,errantnight,4.17,"On the long list of beers that are old staples that I've never reviewed, that I almost feel either unqualified, unneeded, or unable to properly quantify in a simple review how I feel about it. The score will either ultimately seem too low for the esteem I hold it, or too high for overcompensating. I hope I nailed this one, but that's of less importance than this beer.  From a sixer brought by a friend that had never actually HAD an Anchor Steam...  Pours a brilliant, rich orange gold. Crystal clear, beautiful couple fingers of head that rapidly dissipate, leaving little lacing on the way down.  Aroma is a rich, almost toffee-like melanoidin-rich, malt-forward experience, heady and almost caramel rich, it's clean, inviting, warm, just a hint of spice at the end. Good stuff.  The taste is practically the definition of balance. Rich and full through the middle with caramel bold sweetness that drops off into a clean, slightly rough bitterness that makes for a formidable introduction at first, full of flavor. As it warms, the harshness of the bitterness drops out, into a clean, earthy quality. If there's a beer that NEEDS to be available on cask that isn't... it's this beer.  Has a substantial feel to it, a solid medium, maybe medium-full body, which is awesome considering how moderate the alcohol content and how restrained the sweetness.  Really, my ""criticisms"" or evaluation of this beer are almost beside the point. It's an institution, it's an innovator, it's a classic. It's great for beginners, it's practically sessionable. It's important, it's fucking delicious.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Personally a bigger fan a more cloudy appearance but that a personal and not very important note. For a filtered beer the appearance is very nice.  S: The smell is not too remarkable, but you do get a hint at the spicy character of the beer. There is also a nice fruity undertone to the aroma.  T: Very nice, well hopped with a malty finish. A fairly well balanced beer, wouldn't think of turning one down.  M: Excellent! Very refreshing, great for summer or for cutting a heavy meal in the winter. Because of the speed at which the head died I was not expecting such a nice level of carbonation, but the beer seems to dance on my taste buds.  D: Very Good, could enjoy having a solo or a six pack. The carbonation is not overwhelming at all and creates a great combination of refreshment and drinkability.

Leaves a fair amount of lacing on the side of the glass.  Aroma is almost non-existent, very faint hints of caramel malts and herbal/earthy hops.  Taste is full of toasty flavors with some caramel malt. Earthy hops come out strongly on the finish with a good amount of bitterness and almost have a very slight minty flavor.  Mouthfeel is medium-light and insanely smooth, I love the hyrbid ale/lager thing.  I had no idea what to expect from this beer but it's really quite good.

Much more bitter than the aroma suggests. It's not an IPA but the hop bite is quick to show and long to fade, even after the swallow. Still, I'd describe this as a well-balanced beer with lots of astringent malt background. Good body and slightly high carbonation.  If I were blindfolded, I'd presume this to be a typical APA.

28,63,Atlas1,3.95,"My first steam beer review. But by no means my first steam beer.  Poured into my DFH barrel pint glass, the Anchor Steam is a nice enough looking bronze/amber color, with a healthy head on top with good staying power. Little to no lace as the beer recedes. The nose is muted for the most part, but I do detect some earthen dirt scents. They fuse with floral notes and some grassy scents as well. Taste is good. Carbonated fiz with a light caramel flavoring. Earthen, like the aroma, but fruitier. Noticeably faint hop content. Mouthfeel is bubbly, but appropriately lager-ish. Does that last sentence even make sense?  A solid beer, the Anchor Steam. I've always been a fan. It's not fancy, and doesn't hit you over the head or anything, but it's a consistently fine beer. I'd say this sets the bar for steam beer, but it's the only one of the style I've ever had. Still, it's a fine example of an under-used brew, in my opinion.

S: very malty and caramely upfront, with a sticky and raw-ish edge of plum jam as well as sugar-cane-like aroma. Not complex, a bit sweet on the balance. T: the bitter-sweet caramalts and burned sugar-cane upfront are underlined by a touch of coconut-shaving, light prune-ish fruits and sweet herbs, leading fast towards an intensifying bitter aftertaste full of tea-leafy hops and chewy, powdery bitter elements. The finish is IMO the best moment of the tasting, that it's chewy, bitter, and yet free from any residual sugary mouthfeel. M&D: compared with the draught version, the bottled one fares slightly lower due to the slightly more coarse fizziness and also a thinner body, but the trademark flavour profile stays intact.

I can't quite put my finger on it. There's a sweetness, kind of a sweet pastry smell to it. It's subtle and underplayed and yet full-bodied. There's quite a pleasant, almost buttery character on the nose. Almost some kind of deep plummy jam as well? Wow, it's certainly unique.  That sweetness continues on the palate and has a back palate similar to a mild English ale but it's sweet and almost like a waffle or something. Maybe it's because I'd always imagined a steam beer would taste like a waffle for some reason. The palate kind of folds over and well, I don't know. It's unique.

Lots of streaming carbonation. Excellent lacing. Nice looking beer.  Odd toffee characters on the nose, hints of grain bread and molasses. Even an odd tang reminiscent of sea-water. Or am I imagining that from the Anchor imagery?  On the palate, it's quite unlike anything I've tried. The taste profile's just warped. Light, frothy kind of bitterness first up, then a subtle, smooth, vaguely sweet honey character, and finally, a grassy fresh fragrant flavour. Finish is quite dry and with a residual pleasant bitterness. Really even a vague seafood character lurking at the back, which I swear I'm not making up, like fresh mussels or pipis. It's quite unlike anything I've had before, but it's the sort of beer I can imagine starting to crave after a while, just because it's so unique.  Really pleasant, very drinkable beer.

Overall: One of my all time favorites, this could be the best beer made in America.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,beerthulhu,3.63,"A: Poured a ruby-orange with a sticky white head that left a very good lacing.  S: some fresh bread, grains, and sweet caramel with a nice hoppiness.  T: The initial flavor was light sweet toasted malt, light dried citrus with a good floral hop bitterness. A little hop bite in the finish, with some light citrus notes.  M: a little thin but had a good flavor with a light smooth texture.  D: Overall some smooth toasted caramel malting but more of a tweener. Good for one or two but fails to satisfy in numbers.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,WillieMoe,3.88,"A-Pours an orange amber color, with moderate head.  S-The smell is of caramel malt, with just the slightest hint of hop. The smell has a certain airiness about it?  T- The taste starts off a bit hoppier than the smell lets on, but then mixes nicely with the caramel malt taste. Bit sweet, with slight hints of fruit in there as well.  M- A very smooth beverage, that goes down easy, as the light carbonation does not detract from the drinking of it.  D- A highly drinkable beer that is smooth and refreshing, much like the rest of the Anchor lineup.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,ColoradoBobs,4,"Moderate pour from bottle as shown yields a nice white two-finger head over a clear orange-amber body. Ample lacing in drink lines. One of the prettiest lagers I've seen.  I'm usually not crazy about lagers, but this one has a wonderful maltiness right away in the aroma. Strong biscuit malt, bread dough aromas. Floral hops. Raisin bread. Mmmm. Smells very good. Is that a note of smoke.  Taste is similar to the aroma, though the hops are more up front and the malt is more long-lasting. Pine-hops bitterness in the finish. And that hint of smoke?  Mouthfeel is nice a creamy, unexpectedly so for a lager style.  Very drinkable -- more flavor than one would expect for 4.9%.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,HalfFull,4.19,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Pours a clear orange amber color with a half inch head. This dissipates quickly but the carbonation yields a light steady froth on the surface of the beer.  Nice orange hop smell with a tinge of alcohol and some yeasty malts. Very nice on the nose though I'm unable to pinpoint exactly what draws me back, some citrus variant.  Taste is clean and crisp, hoppy up front and finishing with well balance light malts. As the beer warms the finish becomes more complex and bready, yet not overpowering. Feel is good, better than initially expected given the perceived high carbonation. Finish and drinkability are solid. Just realizing that the turn towards a bready finish may be related to the reduced carbonation as well as the warming temperature. I guess further study is indicated.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Chugmonkey,3.87,"Amazing how some beers can differentiate themselves from the pack. This is one of them. Lovely off white head on top of copper color, nice strong carbonation to zing that hop aroma up at you.  Has a great hop aroma. This is key component to a really good craft beer IMO. A really unique rustic flavor that I can't describe but makes this beer unforgettable. Oh yeah, it has a certain rough crispness in the finish that's hard to explain also.  Just a great stlye of beer and this is the flagship brew for the style. Amazing how it continues to set itself apart from the massive pantheon of craft beers these days. A classic.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,LumpyGuitar,4.05,"Snagged a few of these as I love Anchor's Porter and wanted to see what else they had to offer.  Poured a clear, crisp, orangy amber with about a finger of cream head. Head minimized to a thin layer along the top after a minute or so.  Smells pretty malty with a faint scent of something very sweet and a bit of hop.  Taste is complex. The first taste I get is crisp, with a mild presence of malt and the smooth refreshing taste of clean water. After a second the flavor morphs into a mildly bitter hop with some saltiness and finishes with a citrus sweetness.  This beer has a very nice balance between weight and flavor. Aftertaste can leave your mouth feeling a bit syrupy but the mouthfeel here is just about perfect.  In my opinion, this is an amazing beer, but drinkability for me is dependent on season. I would drink this all summer long, and although Anchor has a summer beer, this is much better, and should be considered highly. I'll be buying alot more.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,phantomwyse,3.66,"An interesting beer that morphs complexity while warming.  A: Darkish amber hue, brown honey. Lots of carbonation rising rapidly from the bottom of the glass. Off-white, 2 finger, tightly packed head that seems relentless. Great lacing.  S: Sweet malts, biscuity. Vaguely astringent. Very, very slight hops detected.  T: Bitter malt, like rye bread without the rye (work with me here). As the beer warms, caramel notes appear. Hops appear near the middle of the palate, but act more as a garnish. As the beer gets warm, the hop presence becomes a bit more pronounced and allows the beer to remain crisp while warming.  M: Medium/light body. Prickly on the tongue due to the carbonation and hop bite combination.  D: Very drinkable.  Quickly becoming one of my standard go-to beers for consistent enjoyment, particularly in these warmer months. California Common beers are very unique to each brewer, enjoy tasting the differentiating qualities and nuances from one variant to the next.

S- Sweet malt, caramel, some grains, and some nice grassy hops are very noticeable in the nose as well.  T- Some great tasty caramel malt up front. Some nice cookie dough/bread flavors. The hops balance the nice malt sweetness so perfectly, they're neither citrus nor floral but give a nice grassy bitterness in the end. Crisp clean tasting beer with some mineral water characteristics noticed, almost that of a pilsner.  M- smooth and creamy yet very light in body with nice carbonation.

28,63,mikesgroove,4.4,"I actually had not had one of these in at least five years, so when I was in the store the other day, I just had to pick one up and give it a try. I had always had fond memories of it, and this was going to be no exception. I poured the twelve ounce bottle out into a pint glass and served it right out of the fridge.  Appearance - The pour was very nice with a rich golden amber. Very clear with a shimmering light passing through it. A good amount of carbonation could be seen streaking up toward the surface. A very nice three inch high head of white foam then came over the top and settled down gracefully leaving behind copious side glass lace.  Smell - The aroma was very earthy with a good amount of hoppiness to it. Some nice hints of caramel and grass, with touches of wet hay and a nice bit of grain. Very nice and airy aroma, mixed nicely in with a touch of orange and tangerine.  Taste - The flavor was outstanding on this one. Started out with a nice light caramel malt. Not overly sweet, but rather very nicely balanced with a light grain base and a touch of some nice little bit of herbs in there. A light and balanced floral hoppiness then came over it. Really well placed with some nice orange notes. The finish was crisp and clean. Drying out very quickly and leaving you looking for another sip rather quickly.  Mouthfeel - A very nice medium bodied feel, it was a bit fuller then I thought it would be to be honest. I really enjoyed how well it was put together, with a light and airy feel to it. A good carbonation profile then followed and kept the whole thing together really quite well.  Drinkability - This had everything going for it. Low ABV, nice carbonation, good body to it. A nice light, and flavorful profile that really had a good pop to it. What more could you ask for.  Overall I thought this was outstanding. Really a great session beer and the epitome of the style. You really cannot get better then this, it really has a world of good coming out of that bottle, and there is really just no way you can go wrong wit this one in any way!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Tasty, refreshing, and I definitely want another.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Sweetness is low, and virtually no fruity character. Finish is dry and bitter, with lingering woody hops.  M - light bodied, refreshing. Medium carbonation. Very smooth. Extremely easy to drink.  D - damn tasty and refreshing. very unique session beer.  My first venture into Steam Beer (I don't count the Sleemans Steam I tried 10 years ago). The aroma reminds me somewhat of pilsener, but the taste itself is unique and comes across as rustic. The overall effect is somewhere between a pilsener and an english bitter.

Perfect amber/orange/red body. But no head! Barely a cloud. Quickly to nothing, just this richly coloured syrup. If I shake it I can get a small offwhite head but there is little to no retention.  Weird aromas. Candy corn, noble hop spice, sweet citrus notes, yeast. Very malty though, and rather sweetish.  Palate is too sweet for my taste. Thankfully it is malty sweetness, not artificial in any sense.Tons of residual sugar here. Feel is nice and full too, which is a bit of an intense combination for a lager. Moderate carbonation. Finish is remarkably astringent, earthy notes and a bit of citrus hops clean it up. Chalky, bready. A bit salty too.

The taste is toffee up front with slight notes of roasted coffee beans and the finish is just a slight hoppy bitterness. The mouthfeel is interesting.

What I really like about the appearance is the wonderful head, which looks imperceptibly smooth, and is reminiscent of the fine foam on top of a cappuccino. It just screams steamed to me. Good retention and excellent lacing round things off. Crisp earthy aroma with light caramel notes. Nice astringent bitterness doesn't overwhelm the flavour, but compliments the earthiness and metallic hints very well. A very interesting blend of lager and ale characteristics. The flavour doesn't overwhelm the senses, but this helps to give it superb drinkability and decent body.  There's something about Anchor Steam that makes me view it as the working man's craft beer. Its certainly the type of drink I want on hand after a hard day, because its clean, refreshing and unchallenging.

Notes: It's late and I have had enough of this beer to let you know that it is not only above average,but well worth the time and money.

S - Great nose on this one. Sweet, caramel/vanilla malt aroma with some fruit behind it, something like peach or golden apples. No hop presence which is surprising...  T - The semi-sweet malt starts off, but degenerates into a bland sourness. Earthy/floral hop character briefly kicks in late palate leading to a dry and mineral-like bitterness. Not a huge fan of the taste, but the malt works really well and I feel the hops ruin the taste.  M - Medium bodied with medium carbonation. The beer has a sort of silkiness.  D - I might have a few of these, but the only memorable aspect of this beer is it's aroma.

28,63,yelterdow,4.18,"Freshness code: 8JC. Served at just over fridge temperature in a nonic.  Appearance- An absolutely stunning beer on the eyes. Even on an easy pour, this one billows from its deep orange base and showcases as beautiful and wondrous of a head as Saison DuPont or even the greatest of Belgian Tripels. More than four fingers of soft, foamy suds adorn the glass, leaving behind sheets of sticky IPA-like lacing. Excellence in appearance.  Smell- Soft, slightly metallic hops and an old-fashioned malt nose... I can't really describe it any other way... this smells like 100 years of brewing history and integrity. Raw grains and pure ingredients abound... I've never taken a whiff of the inside of a brewing vessel, but this would be my take on it. As the beer comes to temperature, a bread-in-the-oven scent fills the nostrils.  Taste- First and foremost, the taste is grainy and clean, not complex but very distinctive. A husky, raw, earthy character is quite present, stripping this beer down to the core. Unique and like nothing I've tasted before.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Smooth and easy, this is an effortless beer from the lips to the gullet. Its raw character, leaning more on the grains and malts than hops, positions this as a stellar food beer that would pair well with steak, chicken, or even vegetarian dishes.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Nice coppery gold color. There's nothing especially striking about the nose; there are some floral scents, increasing as we near the bottom of the glass.  In the mouth, it's a bit thicker than I was expecting which is a nice surprise. This beer is very nicely balanced as the taste on the tongue alternates between the hops and the malt. There's a definite bitter note, but the taste really grew on me by the bottom of the glass.  I'll probably look elsewhere for a drink when the warm weather hits, but this strikes me as a pretty great springtime beer; it's got some hints of summer but enough body to fight through the last throes of winter.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Served cold w/ a pils glass  A - A very light shade of bronze w/ a quick condensing head of beige that becomes a ring w/ a tight bead  S - Slightly citrus/tannic w/ green apple hint and an earthy estery combo of malt and subtle woody odors  M - A very effervescent and dry feel w/ a clean finish and nice tannic fruitiness w/ a slight grainy quality  T - Very crisp w/ rye and piney northern brewer citrus rind and spice flavor. There is a gentle rye taste w/ toasted malt flavor and a touch of sweetness w/ grapefruit in small quantities. The overall taste is dry and piney w/ a spice accent there are subtle earthy hop flavors as I taste bottle #3.  D - A fine hybrid beer - more ale like. I appreciate the historic relevance of this specimen to the American Brewing landscape. This is one I welcome to my lips w/ a great hop and malt balance. Pale ale in some repsects yet Steam beer deserves a category all its own. There is fruit and woody earthy flavor but the finish is clean and this one goes down refreshingly easy. I already mentioned I had three, but for a buck a bottle at a place that has a decent selection locally I couldn't resist. Kudos to Fritz Maytag for reviving Anchor and keeping this style alive.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,hellomcfly,3.63,"A - Pours a nice looking copper with ruby and gold hues when held up to light. A fairly aggressive pour into a Corsendonk tulip produced a large, off-white head that dissipated fairly quickly with fair lacing.  S - Spicy hop, malty buscuit aroma  T - A lot like the smell. A spicy hop character hits the front of the tongue with a malty sweetness on the back that transforms into a nice bitterness that is the aftertaste.  M - Nice prickly carbonation, medium body, kind of dry  D - Nice beer that would probably make a good session beer. I think this would be good with many different kinds of food.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,CNeilP09,3.6,"I'm actually surprised at myself for waiting so long to review this beer, as I've always been a fan of anchor. Anyhow, the good stuff: nice copper/red hue. hefty body on the lager. good carbonation. soft fruity cereal notes on the nose. medium viscosity for a lager, a bit heavier on the palate than one would expect (on first try). a spiked dry creaminess on the finish. good beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,clayrock81,3.53,"Poured a dark gold body with some decent head and lacings. A rather simple smell, dry and hoppy with some airiness to it. A smooth, medium bodied brew with a hop kick to it, but also some roasted malts and sweetness to it. The malts and sweetness (caramel/honey?) dominate the tongue and the hops hit for a dryer, but not overpowering backbite. Simplistic, maybe, but still a nice beer to relax with while sitting at a bar on the beach.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,TheEremite,3.09,"I used to really love this beer. I remember it being very full bodied and having way more hops. This is one of those beers that makes me wonder if I've changed or if the beer has chaged. Probably both.  Poors amber/red. Smells of grain husk and some earthy spiciness. Fairly clean though. Tastes very crisp. Clean, and somewhat refreshing. Nothing spectacular, but easy to drink. I'll happily have another.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,barleywinebrewer,3.88,had this on tap the othernight at strangebrew in NH. 910 reviews as of this writing so I'll go with a slightly different angle than usual. This is a classic and good choice most anytime. Maybe my taste buds have changed or this was not the freshest tapline but I'd swear it was hoppier in the past. Regardless it was a great choice at the pub.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,addiegg,3.87,Almost no foam as I pour it into the glass. Reddish brown colour. Smells like caramel and nuts and the smell is nice and powerful. When it comes to the taste I can taste some sweet caramel and then there are bitter hops to keep things balanced. A really nice brew. Gets better when it warms. Recommended.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,BamaBeerBuff,3.77,"A: Poured a wonderful deep amber with a thick, wispy head that left good lace on the glass.  S: Smelled great--definitely some caramel maltiness but mainly an overpowering citrus and fruity aroma. One of the most interesting noses I've ever experienced on an ale like this.  T&M: Wish I could say it tasted the same as it smelled. Initially, the beer has some earthy, grainy flavors, but it quickly turns to intense bitterness. Absent from this was a strong hop flavor, which often enhances the bitterness in such a style. The bite increases in the finish and lingers for quite a while. I basically had to drink the whole thing quickly in about 4 big gulps after the initial taste to keep the bitterness from lingering any long than it had to. Mouthfeel was average: Lots of carbonation, and easy to get down (if you can get by the bitterness).  D: It has a good mouthfeel, but the intense bitterness severely limits the drinkability for me. I could see drinking it with some spicier foods, but definitely not a beer I could sit down and flat-out drink.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,PBBC,4.2,"The beer pours a nice copper color, with a one finger creamy head, which disappears rather quickly.  The aroma is slightly spicy with an almost cider-like malt tang. However, the taste is extraordinarily well balanced, somehow, nothing stands out, but everything is there. The malt flavors are rich, but refreshing, the taste lingers on the tongue long enough to be recognize, but is swiftly moved away by the hop balance.  This beer is incredibly drinkable, giving smooth lagers everywhere something to aim for. Almost dangerously drinkable... a lager version of an english bitter... not too strong, but packed full of flavor, a great beer for all parts of the year, but I would recommend it for summer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,nickfl,4.17,"A - Small, off white head with good retention and lace. The body is copper colored, with good clarity.  S - Malty with biscuit and caramel aromas. There is a slight, spicy hop note and some honey lingering in the background.  T - Malty flavors up front with some toasted malt notes. Moderate hop flavor compliments the malt and sharp, assertive bitterness dominates the finish.  M - Creamy body with moderate carbonation and a dry, slightly astringent finish.  D - Very drinkable. Truly a classic American beer with a pleasant malt character and enough hops to balance.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Rsobotka,3.2,"A: Gold to Dark Brown with a thin foamy head S: Lots of Malt flavor with a little floral of violet T: Tasted like a rich malt follwed by a ravish of spicy hop bitterness M: This, tasty and fun to drink...  D: I could easily drink a 6er of this beer and I hear they open ferment on top of the roofs in SF.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,cdrogers,4.85,"Definitely one I can add to my list of a good drinking and everyday beer. Nothing in this beer is too overwhelming to not be able to drink it regularly :) I had it in the bottle it came in and it had been in the refrigerator for a day or so. I've not had anything else from the brewer, but if this has anything to say about them then I'm looking forward to my next experience. Yep an experience.  I've adding another review of this beer below...this was my second tasting and review.  Yet another one of my favorite beers. I read a lot on Beer Advocate before I decide to buy a beer and this is one of those I've wanted to try for quite some time and finally purchased. It was in a bottle and I chilled it slightly because it was somewhat warm. Poured into a goblet. Much darker, golden color and nice off-white head. I get a nice hint of red-raspberries and strawberries. It goes down extremely well and is a good beer to have anytime. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a good beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,erosier,4.05,Pours a nice dark copper color with a light tan head that faded pretty fast. It laced the glass well all the way down the glass. It has a nice aroma of toasted malts and deeper roasted ones with a slight citrisy hoppy finish to the nose. The taste is a nice blend of sweet toasted malts and more bitter roasted ones with a nice citrisy hop finish. The mouthfeel was very crisp and clean - really refreshing. The drinkability is very high on this beer as it is a really bold yet refreshing beer.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,b5d106,3.76,Appearance= A very hazy orange/brown/red. The head was pretty frosty but it dissipated quite quickly Smell= I didn't much here. A little malt sweetness with some citrusy hops. Taste= Delicious. It has a good hop character with some spice and lemon. The malt is a bit like caramel and balances the beer out very nicely. Mouthfeel= Very nice. A good bit of carbonation. Drinkability= I could definitely put down multiple bottles of this beer in one sitting.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,swizzlenuts,3.66,"A: Dark copper with some carbonation. Not much head.  S: It smelled really malty with not much else to it.  T: It was very malty at first with some undertones I couldn't pick up on. There was a bit of bitterness at the end which made the beer drinkable. All around it tasted like a high class lager; however, it's not what I dig  M: decent mouthfeel, slightly watery.  D: It's a lager, so it's very drinkable.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Dukeofearl,3.88,"On Tap at the local fish house, paired with a nice piece of grilled salmon and vegetables; I think it was $3.50 for a 12 ounce glass.  Poured a deep golden with a very nice white head that was quite pleasant to view.  Aroma was a nice blend of bready malt goodness and sprightly hops- not overpowering as in many of the beers I have tried recently, but still a solid presence. Flavor follows through very nicely- I would have to say that this beer to me is a solid example of balance. Good solid flavors at a moderate ABV, all balanced nicely.  Did OK paired with the salmon; it actually pairs better with more delicately flavored fishes.  Recommended!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,CortexBomb,3.71,"Pour is mild/medium orange with an impressive white head on top. Nose is softly malted.  Flavour starts out nice and full of caramel malts, a certain spicy, peppery tinge shows up about halfway, but the smooth malty overtone stays present for a good long spell. Yeast, bready, nutty with some slight, slight light fruit notes. Very tasty.  Mouthfeel is moderately carbonated and full but nothing particularly special. Drinkability is good, a tasty, inexpensive brew that is available year-around.  The bottom line: Anchor's Steam beer is a venerable oldster on the craft brew scene at this point, but it still persists as a tasty, if not particularly depthy option. A great session brew.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,illidurit,3.91,"Dark ochre in color with a perfect 2 finger head. As it settles to a nebulous cap, the foam leaves some really nice, solid lacing.  Hardly any aroma but I can pick up some caramel malt.  Flavor is quite simple but flavorful. Sweet caramel notes are immediately apparent, along with some brown sugar, cookie dough, and even a hint of fruity esters. There's a tiny hop bitterness in the finish but this beer is all about toasty sweet grain.  Palate is good, with a very smooth mouthfeel that might be a touch high in carbonation. Refreshing, infinitely drinkable.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,rgb2807,3.48,"The pour looks good, with a good inch of head. Looks pretty good producing a yellow-orange color. The smell isn't very strong, and you really don't get much of an impression from just the smell. It'd expect a very light beer from the smell.  The taste is nice, but nothing strong. It is a very mild, balanced brew.  Definitely very drinkable and possibly good for a session, but it's just too expensive for me on the east to every do such a thing. I would drink this again, but I wouldn't seek it out.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,semihobo,4.45,"Nice head over a light brown body. Classic good looks, only head retention could be better.  Smells of peppery hops and a mix of grains. Very clean.  Taste is a rich medley of grains, from start to finish, complemented by peppery hops. The finish is pleasantly crisp with a goodbye kiss from the hops that fades to a lingering starchiness. A rich nuttiness persists throughout.  Vigorous, peppy carbonation is suitable for the flavor. Brisk but not distracting or overpowering.  I've had Anchor Steam before and didn't find it that impressive... now I'm not sure how I missed it. Sit down with a pint and look closely. A gem. Incidentally, reminds me of several Saranac beers -- if you like those, check this out. Now to find another steam beer to compare...",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Pencible,2.87,This poured a dark amber with a little off-white head. It smelled predominantly of malt with some yeast as well. It tasted like dirty malt with some hops bitterness. It was watery and smooth with no carbonation and a very slightly bitter aftertaste. Overall this was surprisingly dirty and bland.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,cfriend2,4.53,"Left this one out a little bit to warm up. This beer pours a rich amber color with a fully thick, off-white, chunky head. Mild citrus and caramel sweetness in the nose with some graininess and earthy hops. Bitter tasting in the beginning, then comes barley and grain and mild hint of sulphur. Roasted malt and caramel. Finishes dry with a mild lingering malt and citrus aftertaste. A beer with a great profile of flavor. The mouthfeel is wonderful, chewy and completely full. Carbonation is on the mark.  This is one of the best beers I've ever had, and my first of its style. I am extremely pleased with this one.

28,63,BretSikkink,3.63,"Dark amber-orange, slightly cloudy, with a couple inch white head. White lacing left.  Aromas of a strong yeast strain and earthy hops. The hops are leafy, with a hint of pepper. Flavor matches; generally a lightish grain bill, assertive bitterness that lasts long in the finish.  The mouthfeel is sufficiently chewy to give a good overall body. Enjoyable, simple lager.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,AgingWarrior,3.75,"Poured a nice translucent dark gold color with a fine looking off-white head of approximately two fingers. The head held up throughout my drinking this brew and it had plenty of lacing.  Medium strength aroma, mildly hoppy with some light malts.  The taste is mildly hoppy with hints of grain. Crisp, clean, nice finish.  Mouthfeel is good, with nice carbonation.  Very drinkable brew, I could see myself having 4 or 5 of these in one session.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Kemmerlin,4.28,"A: Poured an amber resin color with a decent sticky head providing some good lacing.  S: Had some bread yeast aromas with dark rum spices.  T: Interestingly tasted like milk, grass, and slight taste of floral hops. Well rounded hoppy after taste.  M/D: Thick mouth feel like drinking a glass of milk. It is very drinkable and can really see why it is so popular.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,wiseguy142,4.15,"Pours a fragile, light gold with a limp but persistent white head. Smells of roasted nuts with sugar. Taste is a wet and sweet experience, almost like that of pure dextrose or cotton candy but enriched with the overall nutty flavor of the beer that lingers in the mouth past some taste of alcohol towards the finish. Mouthfeel is one of my favorite parts- there's a high level of carbonation but it's not abrasive. The beer is exceedingly smooth and light, unlike any other beer I've experienced. It seems like the alcoholic version of something from Willy Wonka because you almost can't believe it. I've never drank more than one at a time, though, and I feel that after a couple the distinct sweetness might become a little hard to handle but for a single beer, especially if you were to pair it with a dessert or appetizer, I think it's great.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,TYE,3.73,"A - Pours a clear golden amber that produces 1-1.5 fingers of white foam head that dissipates quickly to just a covering with little to no lace. S - Sweet fruit and grain. Well balanced, medium strength aroma. Smells of grapes, maybe? T - Grain and hops. Strong flavor with a hoppy aftertaste kick in the mouth. Taste lingers. M - Medium or slightly more carbonation, medium body, a strong hop bite, and a lingering finish. D - Very hoppy strong taste. Overwhelmingly so. Nicely balanced fruit and grain underneath that take away some of the hop harshness. Not for the weak taste buds! I could only get through one per evening, but I would have another if in the mood for hop overload again!!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Mdog,3.53,"Appearance: Clear amber, huge head.  Smell: Sweet grain, a little grassy note.  Taste: Some grassiness, caramel, and light tea-like bitterness.  Drinkability: Could probably have a few if it was the best beer available.  Was a little disappointed in this, I was hoping for a little more grassy or citrus hop flavors but got mostly tea-like bitterness instead. Not a bad beer, but not to my tastes.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

D - Very drinkable nice on a hot day.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,riboflavin88,4.23,"Bottom line, this is a unique beer. It pours a nice amber color with a nice ivory head consisting of large bubbles and good carbonation. Its smell was malty and spicy with back notes of citrus. The beers' taste is smooth at first, primarily malt and smokey bread flavors. It finishes dry and the aftertaste is more malt, very bold. Mouthfeel is smooth and drinkable, crisp and easy to drink more than one. Definitely try this one!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,youradhere,3.64,"Not sure if I'm just not a fan of this beer, or steam beers in general. Bought this in a mix grab-six-pack from the food Co-op, drank this one first. Poured into a pint glass, darker than commercial lager; flavor was a little too sulphorous, but could taste a good malt profile behind that. A decent first steamer for me, however I don't think I'll go back and stick with ales or true lagers.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,ckeegan04,4.43,Bottle poured into mug.  A- Copper color with thick chunky head. S- Malty aroma T- Very bitter at first taste which was surprising. Faded into an easy malt sweeteness. Very well balanced. M- Good carbonation and the flavor stays with you. D- Could drink this all day long.  The best of the easy to find micros in my opinion. One of my favorites and it seems to be getting easier to find in Tennessee.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,burtonbe,4.23,"A - Wonderful deep amber in color. Crystal clear. Two-finger head, but dissipates rather quickly. Leaves a good lacing.  S - A solid malt aroma with general lager characteristics. Some hoppyness, but it is much less pronounced, very subtle.  T - What a tasty beer. I'm getting a fruity and malty profile. The hop bitterness and flavor is there, but the balance is towards the malt on this one. Some DMS is present, but it seems to really work in this beer.  M - Solid mouth-feel for this style. Carbonation is medium and it is smooth.  D - The drinkability is where this beer really shines. It is so flavorful, yet so very drinkable. I could drink this all day. Very Nice.  Overall, this is an awesome beer of an awesome style. Highly recommended.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,charlzm,3.48,"Consumed 12/14/07.  Pours clear light copper with nice little off-white head that quickly dissipates. Toasty nose with notes of spicy hop. A little thin on the palate, but flavorful nonetheless.  Rich maltiness is quickly upstaged by bitterness, but the whole affair is rather milder than is typical of many west coast brews. A little of the Bass Ale type flavor is going on, and the clean finish with a hint of astringency reminds me a little of that British brew as well. A very easy drinking beer with some flavor.  Might be a good gateway beer to get from macrobrew lager swill to the good stuff.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Head is a thick half finger puffy white.  Smell - malty aromas, slightly creamy. It almost has a caramel like scent. A little hoppy like an ale.  Taste & Mouthfeel - Once again malty and creamy. Set up nicely by the aroma. Hops and a little citrusy through the middle, following through to a crisp bitter finish.  Drinkability - A long time fav for me, and one I keep in my rotation for everyday drinking.

28,63,AshevilleSippin,3.61,"Short Version: Interesting and complex beer. A bit dry and grainy/husky with an astringent, almost metallic, bitter tingle.  Details: Wasn't sure what to think of this at first. My first impression was dry-bitter and mediocre. The more I sipped and the more it warmed though... I began to pick up nuances and got intrigued. Not my favorite style but I've found some respect for this one.  Poured a faintly cloudy amber orange color with a pillowy, rocky 1"" white head.  Not picking up much on the nose but some malty sweetness. Faint smell.  First taste is dry and tingly. Almost like sitting an alkaseltzer on your tongue. There's an astringent bite to it that's bitter but not in the typical fashion. Interesting for sure and not one dimensional in this sense.  There's a grainy husk flavor to it and a miniscule amount of sweetness that helps offset that bitter dryness. Not by much though. Tangy-bitter is still dominant.  As it warms and the level drops I'm picking up more malt in the taste and some caramel in the smell. There's a solid medium body and I suspect there is an ample amount of malt in there. Balance gets better as it warms.  Finish is clean and bitter. Aftertaste lingers zippy and metallic for some time.  Drinkability isn't super high for me. I like bitter but not quite as much for this particular style. This is a dry metallic tangy bitter rather than an alum hoppy bitter that I prefer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,NYfold,3.33,"12oz bottle poured into Pilsner glass.  Good looking beer, although a bit clear. Burnt sienna in color with hints of orange. Off white head leaves minimal lacing. Attractive bottle design should be noted.  The smell is nice, but not strong. Hops, and traces of oatmeal.  I find the taste is crisp, refreshing, and enjoyable with an oatmeal after-kick reminiscent of wood. The Unique after taste is my favorite note.  Mouthfeel is nothing special.

Smell is sharp and clean, but doesn't stand out. Initial taste is a pleasant bitter with sweet caramel notes at the end, very balanced. This beer is smooth, and it goes down easily. It makes a great session beer (and, as I found out, part of a decent sauce for chicken).

Smell: Light caramel smell with a some light lager notes  Taste: A very light caramel taste that is pale, yet has a nice lingering bitter.  Mouthfeel: Low carbonation, bitter and zesty  Drinkability: A great refreshing brew that at 4.9% ABV, makes a great sessionable brew.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,cbleary,4.65,"Enjoyed out of a bottle into a pint glass.  This is extraordinary beer. I think the bottle I had may have been just a little old, but it didn't matter. It poured with a lovely golden amber color with a generous head that left copious lacing in the glass. Gorgeous. The smell was a very nice mix of sweet malts and hops. The taste was a similar balance with the sweetness of the beer kept in check by the bitter hops. It was very drinkable, and I would definitely have this again.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,WaveRebel51,4,"Many years ago, I sampled this and didn't think much of it. But proving that your palate improves with age, I tried this again and came away very impressed. Seems to be a nice hybrid of an ale and a lager -- has that crisp clean finish you find in lagers, but the taste of esters you find in ales.  On tap, the sweet malt taste seemed to be more prevalent, and the hop bitterness more prevalent out of the bottle. Either way, this is a very easy drinking session-type beer. Has that ""liquid bread"" quality to it and being that its from 'Frisco, I can't wait to try it with some good sourdough bread.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Easy to drink and not too strong.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,cookin420,3.65,"Bottle poured into chalice.  A pale- ruby colored brew with a little haze. A stiff head with a thin lacing and little retention.  Smell is of malt, a bready and slightly sour yeast aroma and faint earthy hop flowers.  Lager-like in flavor and moderately citric bittering and flavor hop additions make this a very tasty beer. The malt is subtle but not lacking. Very good.  Heavier than most pales and bitters but lighter than many reds, it could be lighter bodied and still be very good but a healthy carbonation kicks everything up a step instead, while maintaining great balance.  Great as a session or for a quick few after a thirstifying day of work. Real drinkable.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,BMan1113VR,3.7,"Pours with small initial head, creamy with ever so slight off-white tinge. Mostly diminishes, but has good lacing. Very aromatic when poured. Citrus jumped out of the glass at me, a little yeast and very slight malt. Had a scent of sweet apples or cider. Very clear amber appearance. By the looks of things, actively carbonated. Taste, or lack of it, is a dissapointment. Medium duration with a mildly bitter finish, just a really watery taste (much more so than I remember, maybe I have been drinking too many taste-filled ales recently). The mouth is a creamy feel, soft but yet lively carbonation. Lack of taste is the biggest let down for this brew.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,SIRIUS2,4.06,"A: Poured into a pint glass producing an abundant off-white head with good retention and above average lacing. Color is a clear amber.  S: Nice light smell of malt with faint hints of floral hops.  T: Medium bodied caramel malt flavoring is foremost, but is quickly balanced by light bittering. The slightest hint of sweetness lingers after the swallow.  M&D: Great medium body and abundant carbonation. Very satisfying.  I really liked the Anchor Steam beer. The maltiness & bitterness seemed perfectly matched and balanced with everything else about this beer. The body and carbonation made this both lightly filling and highly enjoyable.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Doomcifer,3.43,"Pours a fairly hazy amber color with a good head that retains nicely. Aroma is of grains, yeast, some fruitiness. Not too strong but pleasant. Taste is of more light graininess, yeast, light hop spice found in the finish. Mouthfeel is fair bodied, very crisp, and good carbonation. I could take a few of these down in succession but not an entire 6-pack.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,MrIncognito,4.1,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip pilsner glass.  Appearance is amber with an orange/red hue. Translucent. Two-finger head after a very hard pour halfway through. Head retains for about 3 or 4 minutes then has nice lacing.  Smell is quite nice. Wheat with light citrus tinge.  Taste is pretty much the same as the smell. Not an overly flavorful beer, but very nice. The tastes that are there are smooth. I taste wheat more than anything, almost like a weak hefeweissen, but not quite. A taste or orange on the back of my tongue on the way down.  A very good beer really. Great to have on hand as most people enjoy it.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Clydesdale,4.13,"A: Hazy, amber/copper color. Bubbly head.  S: Somewhat earthy, slightly sweet.  T: Complex flavors. Some hop bitterness at first, then a creamy toasty malt flavor. Dry and somewhat citrusy at the finish.  M: Creamy, tight carbonation. A bit dry.  D: A nice balance of flavors, complicated without being overwhelming. Very tasty.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,avalon07,3.97,"Poured this one from a bottle to a pint glass. Had very little head that dissipated quickly. It had a light brown color that was slightly thin in consistency.  Had a malty smell with a hint of some citrus. Pleasant on the whole.  Had a tart taste, with hops and malt dominating the other elements. Didn't leave much of an aftertaste, which is always a plus.  Had a decent, but not overpowering amount of carbonation for a good mouthfeel.  Overall, this venerable old craft beer is a tasty drink. Not exactly the most complex taste I've ever experienced, but good nonetheless.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,lionking,4,Poured out of one of their big bottles into a pilsner glass. Nice copper color. You can smell and taste the sweet malt. A lot of lagers look and smell nice but I think what sets Anchor Steam apart is its taste and finish. No after taste. Well done. Should have bought two.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Kendo,3.63,"A: Poured into a pint glass. The body is light amber with a small off-white head. Some carbonation bubbles.  S: I get all malt in the nose -- slightly roasted malt, bread and grain.  T: Grainy malt/cereal grains with a bit of sweetness. Finishes with a hint of lemony bitterness.  M: Fairly light, as you'd expect for this style, but not thin.  D: Goes down pretty easily. Not a lot of heft to slow you down, and the taste is ""clean"" if that makes sense.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,JDV,3.6,"Drank this one in the dark in at the Almamo Drafthouse movie theatre, so I didn't see the color, but have had it on tap at Anchor's tour as well. Very nice and fragrant hoppiness, but not overly so. Taste is good, with a good bitter kick and hoppy floraly citrusy taste but with some definite maltiness in there too. I was expecting more hoppy bitterness from what I remember of the first time I had this beer, but was pleased at the amount it had, and the reasonable lasting hoppy aftertaste. I liked this beer, and especially the Anchor Porter these guys make, which is one of my favorites. I look forward to trying more from them.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,CamuMahubah,4.71,"I have discovered a new session beer...  Beautiful amber...  Slight, ever so slight hoppy aroma, very clean...  Nice...I like the way the hop flavors express themselves after the clean, ever so smooth bubble gummy mildly malty taste!...Whatever hops were used are excellent and the recipe is divine! One can easily tell this is a session beer crafted with love!  Great medium bodied brew that goes down easy! So easy in fact this beer is now the offical ""Pizza Beer"" at my castle! Many many times macros have had to suffice at semi-fabulous pizzaria's across the kingdom. Not anymore, wifey's homemade canadian bacon and pineapple pizza and this beer now reign supreme! All hail the ""Pizza King""!  Anytime is the right time for Anchor Steam! I love opening the fridge and seeing this beer! Went to the website just to see those big ol' copper kettles...reminiscent of the handcraftedness and integrity one observes when a pizza is baked in a real stone brick oven!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Redrover,3.73,"I had this one on tap at the Reel Club a new high end seafood restaurant in Oak Brook, IL  Served in a modified pilsner glass (very wide), the beer is a clear bronze with a thickish creamy head. Not a ton of lacing.  The aroma is of floral hops, some malts and a cracker smell. Nice, fresh and nonassertive.  The taste is similar, slightly sweet, a little fruity and floral. Hints of nuts in the background with a bit of pear emerging late. Nothing overpowers you, but it is well put together.  The mouth is light and bright. This is a easy drinking beer. Would be easy to session of your not in the mood for a pallet burner. This beer is easy to pair with food, just avoid anything to spicy.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Smell - smell is a little earthy  Taste - right from the start bitter with a little carmal, great flavor bitterness stays with you from first to last drink.

I really like this beer, incredibale. you don't find many like this.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Homerbag,3.6,"Pours a very clean transparent amber with foamy head. Smell is a little weak compared to most craft beers, but for a low ABV session, its not so bad. Very clean, good water, some hop and malt balance. Taste clean and fresh. Hops are present as is the malt but overall, it is pretty watery. Feels refreshing and almost a soda type carbonation. A good beer for it's style, probably much better on a warm summer day.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,littleshamrocks,4.05,"12oz brown bottle with the bottling code printed on the back of the label. Served in an imperial pint.  Pours a medium amber with a large, creamy, off-white head. It is mostly clear with adequate carbonation. The head hangs on for quite awhile and leaves plenty of lacing. The nose is of toasty, grainy malts and woody, herbal hoppiness. There are also underlying caramel notes as well. The flavor is as advertised by the aroma, the first half is dominated by the lightly toasted, grainy malts and the latter half brings in the herbal hops and a touch of fruitiness. The hoppiness lingers just a bit. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a slightly dry texture and just the right amount of carbonation. Finishes pretty clean.  This is a very enjoyable session beer. It is the hallmark of the style and the standard by which all others in the style are measured. It is extremely easy drinking and the flavor is well balanced and substantially full. For sure, this is one of my favorite session beers.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,elmore,4.2,"Had this on tap and Cowboy Ciaos in Scottsdale, AZ. It was the only tap beer I saw in the establishment, as this is a wine bar. A very attractive beer. Nice amber color with a dense, pale 2 finger head and cascading carbonation. I couldn't distinguish this beer from a Sam Adam's Boston Lager on sight.  Smells of biscuity malt. Very slight floral hops aroma. Tastes of light malts with weak hops aftertaste that doesn't really linger.  Nice moderate carbonation. Light, effervescent, balanced, but kind of watery. Definitely a sessionable beer.  As this is among the first microbrews/craft beer, I have to think Sam Adam's was modeled after this beer, which the character of this beer reminds me of. A good sessionable beer that wouldn't be too offensive to a BMC drinker.  Just a solid beer. Nothing that really extreme, to impress me, but you really have to give this beer credit for starting the craftbeer/microbrew movement.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,BradLikesBrew,4.4,"a: copper body with a big fluffy white head, great retention and lacing.  s: The first whiff detected an earthy, grainy aroma, but the more I smell it, the more I think of bubblegum.  t: Toasted malt, caramel sweetness, lemon, with earthy hops in the finish. A complex yet balanced taste.  m: Dry finish, very clean.  d: A one of a kind offering, an excellent session beer, and a pioneer of the US craft beer movement. Anchor Steam is the definition of a Steam Beer and a must try for beer enthusiasts. Nothing extravagant, just beer made the way it should be.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Tilley4,3.16,"Finally, I get to try the famous Anchor Steam!  Looks a really good copper color in the glass with a small head.  Hmmm.... smells sort of malty but lots of bread too.  Just an average tasting beer really. Sort of tastes like anything I could get down here at the local corner gas station. Malty, bready, with a biting carbonation at the end.  Little disappointing but still, I'm glad I got to try this.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

But I just didn't enjoy it. I tried it on six seperate evenings, and while some were a bit better than others, I never really enjoyed it much.  A: nice copper color, sudsy head, not much retention in pint glass.  S: malty, some hops, not much complexity. very straightforward.  T: predominantly malty, with bitter hops in background. back and forth between the two. can't rate this higher because no layering of flavors detected. very bland (not in a macro-American-lager way - it's strong, but bland, almost a stale taste).  M: heavy, thick.  D: hard to get through even one for me, because the taste is so laboreous.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

A very balanced offering. Can make out toasted malt and peppery hops; a nice sweet finish. Slick mouthfeel that is left a little dry.  A great beer and an American classic.

Taste: Malt, caramel, a slight salt taste (?), light hop tickle, with a dry, clean, citrus finish.  Mouthfeel: Good body, refreshing, very faint carbonation, nice light hop action on the tongue.

January 28, 2013: Poured from 12 oz bottle into a pint glass as a very attractive clear copper color with a generous off-white rocky head.  Aroma is grain, dirt and hops.

Not a good beer. Malty, musty taste with a sickly aftertaste than just hangs on your tongue.  Better than a macro-brew, because at least it has a distinctive taste.

28,63,JamesS,3.98,"My new favorite lager. Anchor steam poured into the pint glass a great amber color, with some nice head and decent lacing. Very light scent, a nice mix of malts and hops, but not much there. Very good flavor, each taste seemed to bring out a hidden quality of the beer, with different swirls of hops or malts. Easily one of the smoothest beers I've ever had. (Have had it from the bottle, too, and not quite as smooth.) An excellent beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

The smell has an odd caramel aroma, kind of powdery (perfumey?); its weird but not offensive. The taste is of lightly toasted malt, grainy, with a shot of bitter hops in the end. Nothing crazy with the hops, subtle. The feel is light but not watery, slightly fizzy; finishes rather clean and crisp. Nothing outstanding here, a bit grainy which I'm not a fan of. However it is nice and light and a good change up brew.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Mouthfeel is super and the drinkability is really exceptional... goes down like water without any bitter aftertones what-so-ever...

Aroma is bunches of toasted and caramel malts melting perfectly into earthy hops... few other brews are like it... clean, no yeast esters at all.  This beer is dialed in... not really any way I can see to make it better tasting... toasted bread and lite caramel... clean bitterness and malts with a long lingering earthy undertow.

I like that, not too many breweries out there actually put effort into letting you know who they are.  A - Roasted light brown to amber coloration, despite the label's promise of a ""thick creamy head"" this pour didn't produce much of one at all, and what did appear vanished rather quickly. No lacing.  S - Great aroma, hard to describe, kinda like malty apples.  T - Good balance between the sweet and bitter profiles which make up this brew. Mild spices come through near the end. Not too much going on here, but it still has a great flavor.  M - Light bodied, good carbonation. Slight aftertaste, watery finish.  D - Not bad at all, I could see this as an easy go to beer.

The taste has a full and very well-balanced body with a medium hop profile and medium bitterness. All of them blend well. There are also some slight grass notes as well. The taste fades into a biscuity malt aftertaste. I detect some flavors arising from this beer's lager yeast roots as well, but hard to put into words. I guess we'd expect this in a steam beer.

Not much lacing, but head retention is never a problem with Anchor beers.  Smell - I never get a ton of aroma here, but I do get light tones of wet earth...faint, but it's a fresh smell, certainly not displeasing.  Taste, Mouthfeel - Here's where the Steam excels, This beer always strikes me as fairly complex, especially for an under-5% session lager. First off, it's balanced. There's a solid backing of sweet malt, and an equally bracing lemony, grassy, earthy hop...excellent, distinctive hop profile. I get hints of pale ale-like fruity esters as well. Slightly sour and funky at times. That's the thing about this beer, no two sips really taste the same. Pair it with food and you get even more diversity. Strong carbonation helps keep things crisp, but never seems too burpy.  Need I even mention that this is extremely drinkable? Easily #1 in its category, and a distinguished, proud American classic. Next time you wear yourself out on high-gravity ales, pick up a six pack of Anchor Steam and be glad.

28,63,bluejacket74,4,"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours copper/amber with a half inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. It smells like caramel, bread/grain, toasted malt and some citrusy hops. Taste is same as the aroma, but it starts out hoppy, then comes the malty sweetness, and finally it leaves a bitter hoppy aftertaste. Pretty nice. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it has a good amount of carbonation and is crisp. Drinkability is good, it goes down smooth and it's easy to drink. I think it's a good overall beer, a pretty decent choice as a session beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,number1bum,4.3,"This one pours out a light amber, slightly orangeish color, with a an off-white inch of head. Retains a nice thin lace, especially around the rim.  Smells of lightly toasted malt and light caramel sweetness, with some light citrus and floral hop aromas. The smell is pleasant and balanced, but light (have I said that enough?)  Tastes a lot like the smell, with toasted malt and a mild sweetness dominating along with just a bit of hop bitterness and citrusy hop flavor. Very well balanced and very refreshing. Crisp carbonation and a nice medium body, yet light on the palate. I could drink this beer all night, a great session beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,flowerysong,4.3,"Appearance: Slightly hazy light copper with lots of bubbles.  Smell: Mild breadiness, earthy malt, and faint caramel notes.  Taste: Begins with a sharp citrus hop bitterness, which gradually falls away leaving an intensely malty finish. Some fruitiness in the middle.

Drinkability: Flavourful and full of character, nice crisp taste and very pleasant to drink.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Umbra,4.63,"Burnt amber brew with a thick two fingered head. Decent retention and lacing. Aroma of bread and slight hops. Flavor changes and is more complex than I remember. Initially hoppy in an English bitter sort of way. That changes towards the middle and end of the brew, where it becomes more caramel with a chalky, dry finish. Mouthfeel is medium and more hearty than expected. However, it's dryness and complexity would lead one to call this an excellent session.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,ryalmighty1,4.18,"This beer actually reminded me of a mild English Bitter almost. Had it at a local Ted's with a Bison Steak. Very good choice. On tap in an imperial pint glass.  Appearance: Nice copper/caramel color to it. Small head that faded quickly. No lacing, but bubbly from good carbonation.  Smell: Earthy malts and wood notes, caramel. A little citrus, very fruity though.  Taste: Malty, but mostly a bitter, slighty citrus taste. Definitely could taste grapes in there for some reason.  Mouthfeel: Not really creamy, but smooth. High carbonation, very crisp. Good alternative to a macro brew.  Drinkability: Smooth enough to be enjoyable back to back, bitter enough to keep it from being a session beer for my tastes. I will definitely have this one again.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Overlord,3.88,"I grew spoiled on this beer while living in the Bay Area. Far more expensive and rare down here in So-Cal (at least, on tap).

Delish.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,TexIndy,3.58,"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a unique dating system into a pint glass. It had a solid copper color. It had just under a finger of white foam that slowly settled into a partial film. No lacing but good carb. The aroma was earthy malts and caramel. The taste was pretty good. Malty with a crisp bitter from start to finish. It has a really bitter aftertaste that sticks around just a little too long for me to really enjoy. I like the strong bitter on the ADIPA's I've been having lately so not a problem with bitter perse but something about this one. The carb makes for a nice mouthfeel. Overall, it's a good beer and worth trying. Not sure I'd buy a 6 pack of it but maybe once in awhile if I saw as a single or if on tap somewhere as a changeup.

T- hops came out right away with some mineral water and burnt toast and biscuit. a very beer taste. not lager, definitely not ale, just BEER. good old beer. yeasty with roasted malt, all the while that musky hop bitterness weaves its way in and out toward an earthy piney dry hop aftertaste.

28,63,shadow1961,3.65,"Anchor Steam Beer pours a big stiff head over a clear deep amber brew. Carbonation is extremely active, and the nose is rich, slightly fruity malt and a bit of herbal hop as well. The flavor is also interesting- stuck between lager malt crispness and ale fruitiness. The finish is dry with a little bit of herbal and grassy malt. For a simple brew it's got a lot of depth to it- it's earned it's following honestly. Good stuff.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,longarm,4.37,"Clear amber beer capped with off-white and thin head. Still it's decently carbonated.  Softly sweet malt aroma evenly layers with light hops. It's not a smack in the face, but delicate, complex, subtle and certainly enjoyable.  Lightly toasted malt with some hop flavor...exceptional balance. Mildly astringent/briefly alcoholic finish is the only detracting feature.  Upfront bitterness followed with moderate chewiness and a quick, clean finish. More please.  I find it baffling that Anchor Steam only gets an 85 on B.A., since it's THE definitive example of the California Common style and one of the catapults for the craft beer renaissance 20 years ago as much as today.

Looks delicious and classic, but nothing extraordinary.  Scent is light and slightly fruity.  Bananas, sea salt, slight alcohol with well balanced malt and hops throughout. Light spiciness. Unique, simple, and very tasty.  Smooth with a mild body.  Easy drinking and juicy. Can't complain, and could enjoy any time. Well-buttered french bread with light ham goes great, and I would like to try this with seafood and a salad.

There was decent retention, but eventually slowed to a nice lacing that held to the finish.  S: Not much of a smell. Smelled slightly malty and alcoholic.  T: Tastes like ""beer."" Reminded me a lot of a macro light lager but tasted a lot smoother. Also, tasted slightly salty, which was interesting.  M: A nice, light mouthfeel that was rather crisp.  D: Definitely a drinkable beer. Does not really taste like much, but it was pretty light and easy to drink. Definitely good for the summer or grilling.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,AustinBeerLvr,4.35,"This brew pours into a very deep, orange body with a very good amount of head. Color is very distinctive.  Nose is mostly citrus like, with a lemon note being somewhat dominant.  Upon the first sip or two, this beer has a distinctive salty flavor too it that actually takes a little getting used too. However, it's by no means excessive, and it actually integrates well into the distinctive taste of this beer. Some caramel and hint of molasses are in there as well, and towards the end, a nice crisp lemon note hits the back of the tongue and rounds things out very well. Low to medium bitterness, just right to round things up. The residual salt taste just slightly stays on the palate, and leaves you wanting another sip.  The number one thing that comes to my mind about this beer is ""distinctive"". Think about it, it's a beer brewed with bottom fermenting lager-yeast, but fermented at an ale temperature. I guess you could say, you kind of get the best of both worlds in this beer. Indeed, this beer more less possesses the flavors of an ale with the smooth crispness of a lager. Only drawback is it's a little pricey, but in my opinion, it's well worth a little extra cash.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Thick head at first that takes some time to settle but once it does it leaves a nice residue for the remainder of the beer. Medium carbonation and lots of bubbles. Smell is mainly of malt and sweetness but there seems to be a small, very small touch of bitterness. Flavor is nearly identical, mostly malt, some caramel with a toasted feel to it but there is a taste of bitter hops in there, a very nice balance. Leaves a slightly dry feeling in the mouth that I wasnt too fond of but wasnt terrible either.

28,63,Gambrinus1184,3.67,"Poured from a 12-ounce bottle into my Pig's Eye Pub glass.  A: Pours a clear, light copper-orange with a very small head that quickly turns to lace. Carbonation is fairly decent.  S: Smells, ironically, a bit like steam. A little fruity hop on the nose.  T: Taste is well balanced between fruity hops and a little sweet roasted malt. There is a lingering malt flavor that satisfies, while the hop leaves a resin in it's wake.  M: Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, not too heavy, and a little sharp on the tongue.  D: Because of lower ABV and crisp, refreshing mouthfeel and flavor, this is a very drinkable beer. There's an element, maybe its lingering sweetness, that would make me choose a different session beer, but I'd sit through 2-3 of these easily.  Anchor seems to have cornered the market on steam beer, but readers beware, Flying Dog puts out a very nice California Common called ""Old Scratch"" that gives this brew a run for its money, if not surpassing it in taste.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Has a little bit of a strange metallic taste.  M-Very bright and carbonated in the mouth. A little slick on the finish.  D-Pretty darn drinkable.

Not spicy or yeasty, but pleasant and crisp. Tasted very nice. Crisp, clean, refreshing, hoppy, delicious. Mouthfeel was pretty good, a bit bitter from the hops, but nice.

Well rounded and smooth with little aftertaste. Tastes a bit like a lager but is more smooth and has a hint of floral.

Aroma is pleasant but can only be called light. toasted grain and mild sweetness. Meh...let's talk about taste!  There's a great light bitterness here, light fruity flavor, plenty of caramel malt, and a drying finish. (though I admittedly have mere seconds to experience the drying effect before filling my mouth with another ""sip"") I think there's a bit of salt flavor, as whenever I have this I'm reminded of deep sea fishing trips as a young man, sipping a beverage with a fine salt spray hitting my nose and on my lips.  Goes down smooth, with a body on the light side and appropriate carbonation. A fantastic thirst quencher, and extremely drinkable.

Taste: The beer has a strong malty presence on the outset, followed by a slightly bitter hoppy finish. Overall though, the beer is well balanced.  Mouthfeel: Medium in body, well carbonated. A touch dry with a crisp finish.  Drinkability: A very interesting beer, somewhat rare and unique. This beer has great taste, an ABV less than 5%, and I don't get bored or filled up drinking it.

Interesting taste. Flood of bitter hop and smooth caramel malt attack the tastebuds in perfect unison. Finish, even with the hop blast, is only slightly dry.  Very smooth, almost creamy mouthfeel.

This is balanced by some bitterness but the malt seems to dominate this brew. It feels fairly light on the palate and has a nice crisp feel from the seemingly high carbonation.

28,63,viperpiper522,4.35,"A- A beautiful ruby with a medium body head that dissapated at an average speed. No lacing.  S- Malt invites you in and at the end some hops foreshadows that experience to come.  T- Hoppy and full of complexities. Is it the high fermentation temperature that makes Anchor Steam so special, or is it the love put into the recipe? I don't know but I don't care. Delicious.  M- Leaves something behind that I enjoy. Sort of sticks around in between sips so you maintain that flavor.  D- Great If it wasn't so expensive here in MD I would make it a regular on my roster.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,JudgeRoughneck,3.93,"This is a beautiful effervescent copper color and shows a nice spongey, eggshell head, with no lace really. The nose is herbal hop, sugar, cracked grain, and very faint all around. Taste is smooth, soft, bready grain with a pleasant brassy undertone. The finish is drying, with a faint hop aftertaste. This beer is a great example of one that puts emphasis on malt, yet stays extremely light and refreshing. The mouthfeel is round, smooth, fluffy.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,BBM,3.95,"Poured a clear golden yellow, with a thin white head. Aroma was slightly spicy, slightly grassy, but mostly malty.  This is the consummate pale lager. A wonderful balance between the sugary malt and the slightly spicy hops makes this a pleasure to drink. You can tell why this one kicked off a revolution. If you've never tried it, you're missing out. A dependable beer I could have anytime.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,MTNboy,3.71,I thoroughly enjoyed this beer I had heard great things and they were true. No wonder this beer saved the company.  Appearance- An orange-amber color that is copper like a penny. A nice two finger head that sustains itself for quite sometime.  Smell- Oh! The odor of sweet hops .  Taste- A very sharp taste with a good amount of hops bitterness but not over powering. It blends well with the malt.  Mouthfeel. Medium bodied that is slightly chewy.  Drinkability- I like this beer and I strongly recommend it.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Padron4KM,3.47,"12 oz bottle with a factory date code on the label.  Clear copper, with a two finger off white head. Moderate lacing.  Aroma is malty, caramel mostly with a touch of nuttiness.

I got this on sale for $6.99, but I wouldn't pay the $9 it usually is.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,jp62099,4.48,"This is a beer I have seen on the shelves for a while but never have tried. I'm trying many different styles more often and never realized that this was in its on category. I would say as far as Steam Beer, it is not going to get any better than Anchor. Very surprised. Amber color, malt sweetness and lemon undertones, taste is malty, with a slight bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth and somewhat creamy. This is a great session beer, drinkability off the charts.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,basica,4.1,"I have been very eager to taste this beer and thanks to Chris for getting it back for me from New York. :) This is my second Steam Beer I have had tried; my first being the Steam Beer draft at Brewerkz. Naturally, I am keen to make the comparison. :) The Steam Beer pours out amber golden in color with an average head and an average head retention; good carbonation as well. It smells like the a typical American Lager, strong on the Barley malt. It tastes, however, less like a lager and more like the Brewerkz Steam Beer; the ale taste. I believe it is again, the fermenting of lager yeast at ale temperature. Nice malty yeasty taste like the Brewerkz Steam beer; some similarities but not exactly. Very fresh and refreshing taste as well but with a bitter finish which I would not prefer as much though it had not affected me that much. Nice taste, similar to the Brewerkz Steam Beer but I generally prefer the Steam Beer from Brewerkz to the Anchor's version.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,TheManiacalOne,4.01,"Poured from a 22oz. bottle into a US tumbler pint glass.  A: The beer is a bright golden brown color with a medium dense white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.  S: The aroma is of caramelized malt and a little bit of spice, fruit and hops.  T: The taste is fruity, spicy and malty, with flavors of caramel & citrus. A strong but complimentary hops presence comes in quickly and provides a very good balance without being over-powering. Once the hops flavor fades a bit, theres a nice bready taste that remains with a mild sweetness.  M: Crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, clean finish.  D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, this is good beer to stick with for an evening if you want something a lot of substance that isnt going try to knock you over. I liked this beer and thought it was very good.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,williamherbert,4.12,"Excellent hazy dark orange look. Shows a nice head that takes its time going away. The light seems to hit it juuust right. No lace.  Gives off a well-balanced pub ale smell. Has a great combination of the dry English malt and some flowery hops. Also has that trademarked smoky (steamy) aroma, like a BBQed beer.  The flavor is of a terrifically balanced pub ale taste, matching the parallel smells listed above. It does have an additional roasted malt, and more of that smokyness. Biscuity but has a *tiny* bitter finish.  It's slightly thick-feeling but smooth. No bite whatsoever, and thicker than you would think. It's a substantial ale but with a flowery -- and smoky -- depth. Very very good.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,choyhosoi,3.48,After reading various reviews about this beer I decided to try this brew. I must agree with the majority this is a good beer. It has a little bit of an aftertaste after awhile but nothing to make me not want to not buy another one. The color is amber and the smell was citrus like.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Bitterbill,5,Purchased at Bi-Rite in Casper.  This pours from 12oz bottle a clear amber gold with a nice medium sized head of foam that sticks around for the entire session and it has good lacing.  The smell is pretty delicate but I get some hop bitterness and some roasted malt.  The taste is very good and flavourful. Roasted malt and grain that's semi sweet hits me first and then some caramel malt provides some sweetness and that's backed up by a good hop profile that adds some nice bitterness. It has a very good mouthfeel and has medium carbonation. The finish is all nice and bitter and it leaves a short but pleasing aftertaste. This is a *very* solid brew that I need to visit more often. I heartily recommend it!  Edit. Almost 13 years later and I truly realize how much I appreciate this beer. I have to have it. Scores adjusted accordingly.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,brendan13,3.87,Pours a golden amber colour with a inch or so of head. Small lacing left right down the glass. Smell is predominately caramel malt with some herbal aromas floating around in there too. Sweet caramel malts come through again in the taste as well as some grassy flavours. Mouthfeel is medium with just enough carbonation. Biscuity aftertaste. Quite a nice balanced beer that I would drink a lot of. Unfortunately it is sporadically available here and pretty bloody pricey ($5.95-7.99AUS) Otherwise it's be a 4 at least in the drinkability.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,MiguelMandingo,4,"Damn this is a solid brew. Everything about this beer is good.  Poured a bomber (odd shape for a bomber) into a large pilsner glass.  Appearance - Transparent gold and copper with a 2 finger head. Good looking brew.  Smell - Floral-y citrus, with caramel and toasted malt.  Taste - Complex. Bitter from the get-go. Yum. The toasted malt makes an appearance before the citrusy finish. Very earthy. The best description: balanced.  Mouthfeel - Good. Near perfect carbonation level.  Drinkability - Great taste and low ABV. It doesn't get much more drinkable than that. Easily sessionable.  Well, I think this is my new session brew. Great flavor and cheap.

Aroma: Caramel, bread, yeast. Smells very sweet, with a light floral hoppiness.  Taste: Citrus comes through in the flavour profile. Grapefruit like bitterness, caramel shows up here as well. Moderate hop bitterness and chewy. Still pretty well balanced.  Mouthfeel: More than medium bodied, creamy.  Final Statement: Now I understand why this is such a classic. This is just a good solid brew, a lager that drinks like an ale. A must try for any BA.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,DoubleJ,4.3,"Part five in the Unorganized Invitation brings us to Anchor Steam Beer. Time to try to out:  In color, the beer is amber in color with a soild, desne head. The flavor is dominated by toasty malts, and it's damn tasty. A little fruity underneath the toasty flavor, creamy, and thick. Yum. I've found another option for a session brew.  I had hopes for this beer, and boy it did it hit the spot. It just took the lead in the Unorganized Invitational from it's brother Anchor Bock.

28,63,Brad007,3.12,"This beer pours a copper color. Aroma is somewhat malty. Taste is somewhat of a cross between a lager and an ale, as expected. Some fruitiness of an ale balanced with the smoothness of a lager. Interesting combination of styles.

28,63,bosco7,4.13,"Copper in color; no chill haze; creamy head; quality lacing.  Aromas include peach, earth, and caramel malt.  This is such a unique beer. Fruit like quality from the esters produced at higher temperatures during fermentation and a spicy clean finish that lager yeast strains are known for. Love the contrast. Hops are well pronounced and quite floral. Finishes with a clean bitterness.  This is the perfect summer companion. Easy to drink all day/night. Can't find anything that comes even close to this beer as far as quality and uniqueness. Pairs well with any pasta dish.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Hops add just a touch of grassy aroma.  T- Malts once again dominate. Nice caramel flavors are complemented beautifully by the spicy hops. Bitterness is moderate and balances the beer out nicely.  M- Nice medium body and good carbonation. Solid.  D- Excellent. I could have several of these no problem. Great session potential.  Great beer. I can see why this beer is so popular.

28,63,Illini5596,4.6,"Revisiting this beer to give a more full review. When I first cut my teeth on this beer in 2005, I was just getting into the world of real craft beers. Prior to that I only had experience with a handful of craft beers and while a bit of a beer snob, I was not the connoisseur I am today.  Head is rather impressive and very foamy with some lingering lace, easily an inch and a half of head after the pour. The head has a creamy texture, which isn't very sticky at all, even the lace is frothy and foamy in comparison to other beers. Color is a beautiful amber, and crystal clear.  The smell is full of grains, hops, and a fresh cleanness that I associate with steam beer in general.  This is still one of my favorite ""every day"" beers. It isn't too strong, yet has a lot of character. The taste begins sweep and slightly sharp, hints of citrus and hops, then smooths out to a nice biscuit creamy full flavor that leaves you with a refreshing after taste.  Mouthfeel is very soft, velvety and satisfying.  Still one of the most drinkable beers around. I definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone.  ====Old Review is below====  I've had Anchor Steam in both the bottle and on tap, it's an excellent experience either way. It has become my defacto beer of choice when I can find nothing else on the menu. I'm not saying it is strictly a fall back beer, it's pretty much my ale of choice all things being equal, and it is a right enjoyable brew. It just tends to show up as one of the few good beers on some of lists in town, when I'm not at a true beer drinker's bar.  While not as excellent as some beers, don't be surprised when this one turns out to be one of your favorites. It's good old reliable, good to the core, and a good beer to start out any night.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Stephen63,3.9,"A - Attractive almost reddish colour with patchy head once it had quickly dissipated.  S - Mostly malt, slightly floral.  T - Sublte with only mild hops and buttery taste.  M - A bit fizzy for my liking.  D - Extremely makes a great six pack.  Anchor Steam deserves its classic status and is a very dependable beer, like an old friend. Subtleness is its strength.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,BDTyre,3.55,"An interesting brew. Nice old-penny copper colour, and a respectable light tan head.  Bready, malty smell, reminiscent of an English pale ale.  Taste is a bit more industrial. Yeast, malty flavour but a noticeable metallic tinge. Not quite sure of the source, but I've noticed this in English pale ales before, and some lagers.  Decent mouthfeel, but despite its shortcomings in the taste department this is an oddly drinkable beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,BlackHaddock,3.03,"Brown 355ml bottle, best before Oct 2008, drank Apr 2007.  Poured into a Corsendonk Tulip glass, dull copper, hazy more than cloudy. A good white head and carbonisation rising through the beer to replenish the head as it shrank away.  Aroma of malt biscuits and some caramel.  Unremarkable taste, barley malts and not a lot of anything.  A slight bitterness does linger in the aftertaste, but there is no great body to this beer, it isn't watery by any means, but there just isn't much too it either.  A little disappointed with this one really, was expecting more flavour and a better mouthfeel from a beer most beer lovers in the UK have at least heard of, if not tried.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Poured in to a pint glass, copper color with a small bone white head leaving some lacing.  Smells malty/watery.  Tastes better than it smells, sweet carmel malt, slight hop bite at the finish.  Easy on the palate, nothing here really makes the beer stand out, but it has fairly good balance.

Taste: Slighty hop tang, which I thoroughly enjoyed, followed by a dried fruit aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Slight to weak overall mouthfeel. Easygoing beer.  Drinkability: Overall, this was a nice beer.

Not bad, but hardly an assault on the senses. I'd give it a weak recommendation.  The beer is a pleasing golden amber with decent had that rapidly dissipates. Aroma is lightly sweet and just a bit hoppy. There is very little hoppiness in the flavor, which is rather malty and very sweet which was OK.

28,63,soupyman10,3.13,"Got this after hearing so many rave reviews on BA and from friends. 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a fairly reddish copper color, almost amber but not quite. A little bit of lacing after one finger head faded. Smell was mostly malty, bready. Taste was a lot of bread and grain. Slight sweet maltiness, and even slighter hop aftertate. Overall, though ,the grainer texture and taste dominates, with a more standard lager flavor following up. Feel is fairly thin bodied, with that grainy texture and medium carbonation. Um...I dunno. I feel like I'm supposed to like this beer - it's unique and...fairly acclaimed - but I didn't. It's definitely better than your standard macro-lagers, or even most lagers overall.

I'm actually picking up peppery (spicy) smell. I'm picking up any type of hops really. All in all, not bad, but not flashy.  Taste: Primarily this has a strong biscuity or yeast-like taste. The caramel or toffee notes blend very nicely. It also has a nice malty taste to it. There are a bit of hops, but it's mostly a malty taste.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied and leaves a dry taste in my mouth. But, it's very drinkable. Overall, this is a classic, very good beer.

28,63,Redwood21,4.6,"Upfront: My review ""MAY"" be biased. This was my first craft brew, and it was love at first sip. If anything that should be a statement to its quality. Its fun because its steam beer, not a lager, not an ale...its steam beer.  A: This beer is probably my favortie to look at. It pours a great amber color. The head is sort of a tan/offwhite color that pours thick but then drops to form a nice lasting thin veil. Beautiful.  S: I was suprised that a beer style labeled steam was so fragrant. I later learned where the ""steam"" term came from and realized my earlier thought was foolish...any way when you pop the cap and get a whiff its just good.There is some malty aromas but overall its just a reat smell that makes me want to start drinking.  T: This is where all beers make their moeny, and this anchor steam is ""my"" favorite, Its a beer that no matter what mood, what meal, what occasion, ill know id love to have one. there is a malty grain taste, with bitterness as well. The flavours like the aromas meld so well, and are balanced so well its hard to describe seperate flavours.  M: Extremel smooth, not sure how else to say ityou wash it around your mouth and is just tastes great and goes down so easily.  D: Highly drinkable, my all time session beer.

A slight off-smell detected. I hate to say this, but it smells a little like, well, poop.  Taste is bright tangy fruity, slightly spicy, with a strong toasty/bready finish. Again, hops are muted. A little grainy and metallic. A definite tang in the finish that isn't real pleasant.  Bright, tingly carbonation in the mouth, a little too much.  Drinkable beer, but definitely not something I buy on any kind of a regular basis.

28,63,demcorhip,4.18,"Appearance A light coppery amber lager. The vicorous pour resulted in a generous 2 finger off white head. This brew had a persistent level of fine carbonation. Clingy and intricate lacings did there best to defy gravity and pretty much hung out where they stuck to the glass.  Aroma Pleasant mild aroma of toasted white bread and crust. A pear like fruitiness, as well as mildly floral hops with a touch of lemongrass.  Taste Yummy and straight forward. Cracker, toasted white bread and crust. Mildly yeasty with notes of pear. Finishes slightly bitter with a touch of lemon and green grass.  Mouthfeel Light bodied, somewhat crisp, but certainly refreshing brew. Very well balanced with its lightly toasted malts and continental hop compliment. Almost creamy.  Drinkabiltity Very drinkable, straightforward, approachable, yet tasty, wel;l crafted session brew. Would be a great brew for introducing BMC drinkers to craft brew. Will be enjoying a few more of these this summer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Head fades into respectable lacing with a healthy stream of bubbles rising to the top.  Grainy mash scent with little hops to speak of. Not the most fragrant of beers but not offputting at all.  Slight pisner-ish hay taste, refreshing hop presence although not a dominant force in this brew. Slightly tangy quality to a finish that is otherwise very clean.  Good body and very crisp carbonation that avoids numbing the tongue. This will never blow away my taste buds but Anchor Steam is one of the very best sessionable American beers in my estimation.

A - Red amber in color with a nice solid one finger tan head. Lots of lacing on the glass.  S - Unique and sweet. Caramel and sugar cookies. A bit of hops in the background.  T - Sweet and tasty chewy caramel candy. Thin hop profile is thankfully unintrusive. A very malt-forward caramel brew with some pale ale like qualities.  M - Medium bodied. Slightly dry finish. Very fine carbonation feels smooth on the tongue.  D - Pretty decent. I could drink these all night.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,alexskovan,3.52,"Let me say right up front: I don't LIKE this beer. I never have, and I've tasted it many times and tried to like it. So this is a bit of a tough review for me to do because -- despite the fact that I don't care for the taste -- I recognise a complexity in it that speaks well of the craftmanship of the brewer.  Pours a cloudy amber with an off-white head. Smell is very rich and full of fruity esters. I like the aroma a lot more than the taste. The taste. . . a lot going on, and the effect has always felt unbalanced to me. It jangles me rather than soothes me. But there are grapefruit hops, fruity esters, and a malty sweetness. But to me it feels like they are all fighting each other.  Strange brew. I don't like it, but I'm sure that's my palate and not the beer. I recommend you try it and see what you think.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,numenor1,3.81,"This is an odd beer for me. Everytime i drink one it seems to taste a little different to me. Sometimes the yeast goes a bit chalky, sometimes the hops are especially grassy, sometimes it comes off really earthy and rustic, sometimes it seems really clean. Even out of the same six packs, maybe my palate has just been wacky lately. Anyhow pours hazy light copper with a decent head. Smell is lightly malty with light yeasty fruitiness and spicy hops. Starts off with a nice even keeled maltiness, the yeast then perks up with some fruity notes and earthiness accented by the hops. Hops turn spicy through the finish. Light body, highly carbonated, not abrasive, but not creamy either--just the right level of aggressiveness. Great session beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,cheers2beers,3.47,"Appearance: Pours a lightcopper hue with a slightly off-white head that rose up to be about three fingers high and quickly died down to a quarter inch of foam. A few columns of beading can be found. No laceing is noticed.  Smell: The aroma has a nice grassy hop character, along with some floral notes. This has a very pleasant sweet malt profile. No alcohol in the nose.  Taste: The flavors are much like the nose. Grassy hops, the taste of flowers with a vague alcohol is definitely present. No sweet malts like the nose. Just some light fruit accents.  Mouthfeel: Thin bodied with medium amount of carbonation. Goes down easy and has a ""suds"" finish.  Drinkability: This is a decent beer overall, but its not something out of the ordinary. Just an easy going, go to beer.

28,63,chuckm,4.33,"Because this was the first steam beer I was ever exposed to I suppose I'm biased towards it , still while pouring a magnificent 2.5 finger head and lacing the glass nicely it lacks a distinctive smell. Taste , while not overpowering is strong enough to get your attention and I find it to be a beer one can drink all night long ( assuming an unlimited budget).",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,copasetic,4.4,"Pours a slightly cloudy deep orange with a thin creamy head that forms a film on the surface that lasts for most of the beer. As I drink this, I realize that it's been a long time since I've enjoyed an Anchor Steam beer and wonder how this can be. The aroma is faint malt, just a little biscuity, with a hint of non-specific hops. From the first taste to the last, this is an nice middle-of-the road beer: smooth with just a little yeasty spicyness, a little hoppy but not particulary high in bitterness, and vaguely sweet and rich, but not too rich. I suppose this is homage to the idea of the California Common beer --nice qualities from both beer worlds.  I'm very happy that I decided to pick up a six pack after a long hiatus. This is an excellent beer. You can't drink just one.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,beeragent,4.04,"I have to say this is the only steam beer I've been able to find in my area, so my review is only based on this, and not comparable to any other beer.  A - The beer poured a medium amber, forming a small thin head, that quickly faded, leaving no lace on the glass.  S - The aroma is light, mainly consisting of fruit notes, and maybe a little malt. The aroma is weak, so thats all I could really detect.  T - The taste is not like any other beer I've experienced. Light hops at first, followed by a little malt in the middle, and finnishing with a dry sour taste.  M - The mouthfeel is medium, with a rough finish.  Overall, I dont think I could drink more than one of these at a time. Not having experienced this style, I cant really say if its a bad example, or a good one. I'll have to try the style more, before I can say if I like it or not. Congrats to Anchor though, for going the creative mile!  Edit: Must have been a really bad bottle from my previous review, as I'm now trying one again, and it's fantastic!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,PEBKAC,4.45,"One of the most accessible beers around, I absolutely love it. Everytime someone comes over, it's served. I had to remember to hide a few, so that I could actually review it before having to satisfy grandpa's never ending thirst.  The color first off starts as a very deep ruby hue, but it reaches a nice clear bourbon once it touches light. Like little sea monkeys racing towards the surface, the carbonation never stops. A pasty head, & a twingle in my nose. Smells like stepping outside into a bushy backyard garden. Add in some granny smith apples, & maybe even some candied ginger with a bunch of extra crusty sugar.  The carbonation holds your tongue in place while everything works around. Pumpernickel is just everywhere. Spread along the top is some sweet butter. More of the fresh butter taste, & not the slick greasy feel, as this beer is nice & sharp. A little puckering sensation at the end. Nothing too intense or alienating. Very unique. Lovely.  :D",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

S: I can get some pear, mint a marinara herby tomato sauce smell ( yes i know thats weird, but i reckon i smell that in Paulaner Munich Helles aswell - must be the malt)  T: Pretty bland, a nice hop bite in the end, not a lot of malty profile in this one,  M: medium carbonation, a little thin.  D: A very drinkable session beer, that has little character in my opinion, just something to pour down your neck. However, does beat macro in appearance and smell, not too sure about taste tho. Glad i tried it once.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,treehugger02010,3.53,"I got this 12 ounze (?) bottle from the Fox and Hound in King of Prussia, Pa. I poured it into a pint glass. Appearance: I poured about 2 fingers of head that didn't feel like staying for very long. THe lacing was thin and sparace, but still there. The body of the beer was a dark, but transparent brown. The head produced a bit of an off white color. Smell: There was many nuances with both the smell and the taste, but the over all impression I got was that the IBUs were not that high. Taste: This brew, played games with my taste buds and certainly demonstrated that different parts of you tounge taste different things. I won't spoil the suprises, but it is worth looking it just to see this. Mouthfeel: The first couple sips were kind of ridge, but as I settled in, they became much smoother. Drinkability: I would say this is certainly a drinkabile beer. Don't drink and review.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Taste is very crisp and pure. A slight hoppy bitterness shows itself as the beer warms.  Mouthfeel is excellent. Dry, crisp, with slight carbonation and a slightly bitter aftertaste.  This is one of the most drinkable beers I've had! I could drink these all evening long, and at just 4.9% that would be a great option!

28,63,Mebuzzard,4.1,"Pours a light orange/yellow, with some haze and a fluffy white head. The head lingered for a while, but didn't last more than half the drinking time. Smells of sweet malt, some citrus and a bit phenolic. Tastes like a dry lager. Mostly malt and biscuit, yet a bit dry due to the hops. Some floral and diacetyl, but that may be due to the tap lines. Crisp feel, especially if its colder. A nice low alcohol brew. Should try it again in the summer",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,bgraney,2.98,"Hazy amber, minimal head. As the beer settles the bubbles emerge. Mild biscuity aroma with a slight hop presence in the background.

28,63,benito,4.83,"I don't know that Anchor Steam is one of the best beers made in the US today, but it is the seminal and definitive beer in this style, and any other California common or steam beer lives in its long shadow. Hence my scores.  A: Copper with a large fizzy head with high sturdiness.  S: Minty and woody. Exactly what I expect from this beer and, in turn, style.  T: The start is soft with a strong flavor of honey and is followed by a slightly bitter, dry, and bready finish. The minty hop presence carries through the flavor and adds a nice, refreshing zing.  M: Very soft and smooth. Medium bodied with good length and an ongoing emergence of flavors.  D: Top notch. This is a great session beer for any time of year.  There are more ambitious beers on the American market, and there are lots of other good, innovative steam beers too, but this is a classic and one that never dissapoints. Highly recommended.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,mpyle,4.07,"Creamy white head. Smallish but lingers nicely. Pale amber color and excellent clarity. An attractive brew.  Aroma is very clean, with some caramel maltiness that increases as the beer warms.  Has a hoppy bitter initial impression, balanced somewhat by a caramelly maltiness. Finishes moderately dry and generally bitter, the malt isn't completely lost at the end. Tasty.  Light to medium body with moderately high carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel despite the carbonation.  Overall a flavorful, bitter, clean beer with just enough malt to keep it balanced and interesting.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Aroma--Smells of slight carmel, malt and hints of a metal trash can. Smells like a dirty bar room floor. Sorry. A combination of puke and metal.  Taste--This was terrible. Actually one of the first beers I have ever stopped drinking. No skunking, but possibly it has gone bad. Unfortunately, there are no dates for freshness. That is their fault for not labeling as such. It was bought at a very good high volume store--Binny's in Chicago. I am willing someday to try again based on the favorable reviews of others. But if it has gone bad it speaks volumes to the importance of date labeling.  Mouthfeel--Watery, flat metallic- awful.  Drinkability--I stopped drinking it.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,jdg204,3.88,"Figured it was time I got a fresh 6 Pack to review this hallmark brew, I was glad I took the time as it had been a while since I had one.  Appearance - Nice golden, amber color with a lovely, full white head.  Smell - Nice light aroma with sweet fruits and a spicey hint, not a whole lot here though.  Taste - A light sweet malt flavor when you first try and then a very nice hop pop backs it up but does not overpower, there's also some bitterness there that works with the hops to provide a nice CRISP sensation, hard to beat. Definetly comes through more as you let it warm a bit.  Mouthfeel - Extremely smooth consistent feel, this is an easy drinker.  Drinkability - A classic session brew and a nice return to excellent ""normalcy"" for me after having several complicated brews over the Christmas season. This classic lives up to it's name and is a great easy drinking brew while still providing phenominal quality.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Hammarby,3.71,"A: Amber with offwhite head. S: Kind of faint smell of malts and alcohol. Not a big nose. Maybe some caramel. T: Malty with pleasant bitterness in the aftertaste.

28,63,supercolter,4,"I must say, this is a very different brew. Appearance is good with some head and a collar that lasts the whole glass. Smell is good but odd.

Drinkability is on par.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,micro108,3.95,"The beer pours a mid-amber color, and has a firm, thick bubbly head. It is mildly-carbonatedand and has a pleasant citrusy hop smell. A quick sniff in the glass reveals a touch of grainy malt and a more floral character to the hops. In the mouth it is not too lively, with the flavor dominated by a firm bitterness, displaying the floral hop character noticed in the nose - the citrusy character is there too, but becomes more subdued as the beer warms in the glass. It is balanced by a dryish but rich malt body, with a caramelly, burnt touch. Finish is a bitter blend of burnt caramel and hops, leaving a lingering bitter and slightly cloying aftertaste on the tongue. A great beer - one of the better-known American craft brews, but deserving of its popularity.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Grundle20,3.86,"Appearance: Pours a solid copper color in to a pint glass. there is a big sticky off white head with some great retention, it left me with a little bit of a beer mustache as a result of my lack of patience. There's some decent patchy lacing.  Smell: There's nothing here really. A really tiny note of citrus rind or unripe banana but not much else to speak of. This is the only California common that I can think of so I left this as a 3 because I really don't have any reference to argue it one way or the other.  Taste and Mouthfeel: It's drinks light with a fruit punch note. It reminds me of certain IPAs with out the big hopping. It hits you with some initial hop bitterness but then it just moves on to the tropical fruit notes and some floral touches in the finish. There's a slightly ""green"" after taste like that of edible flower petals but it's neither bad nor good.  Drinkability: This beer pretty much screams drinkability. It's got long haul ABV, a good variety of flavor, and it doesn't leave you regretting your last sip with an awful aftertaste. Very enjoyable in this aspect.  Bottom Line: This was my first legal beer if I remember correctly and I remember really not liking it. I'm drinking this and realizing how my palette has developed because this really is a pretty damn good session beer. Next time you're watching the game or hitting the woods with the guys sub out your macro or even craft lager and bring a case of these along.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,SilentSabre,4,"Had this on draught at the Mellow Mushroom on Hwy 5 in Douglasville. I was quite impressed with it. It poured a burnt orange colour with a very pretty off-white head. Lots of CO2 streaming skyward kept the foamy cap from fading away for some time. Plenty of glue-like lacing in this one, too. Looks good. The smell was quite lovely, as well. Heavy malt, with light hops, this almost reminded me of the breakfast cereal Sugar Smacks. Certainly very inviting. Much more hops in the flavour than was evident in the smell. This is very well balanced. Pleasant, malty sweetness up front, and a nice hop bitterness on the finish. A rock solid beer. Mouthfeel seemed well rounded and very easy to drink. I truly enjoyed this one. I ended up having two pints. Delicious!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,carolinabeerguy,4.17,Appearance: Poured a medium caramel with a substantial 2-3 finger light cream head which dissipated fairly quickly to about 1 finger leaving minimal lacing.  Smell: Hints of bitter citrus with sweet malt. Very nice combination.  Taste: Nice bite at the beginning fading into citrus. A very nice bitterness builds up to the finish. Bitter aftertaste that isn't overpowering. Very enjoyable.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a bite. Your mouth feels coated with it even after swallowing. Mouth waters a bit for more. Not too heavy nor too light; just about right.  Drinkability: Goes down exceptionally smooth and leaves you wanting more. Definitely not too heavy to enjoy several in a sitting. Very drinkable.  Overall: I'd rate Anchor Steam as a very solid beer. Great flavor and high drinkability make this one I would recommend and will definitely continue to purchase.

Smell: Sweet, with hints of the the grassy smell you get from a macro lager. Almost a carbon/charcoal odor.  Taste: A pretty good bite up front from the carbonation. A little malt, not much, then some of the grassy hops, finally followed by a decent level of bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Higher than average level of carbonation. Good, creamy mouthfeel.

The taste is complex and full of character, but it is neither heavy nor compact. Roasted creamy malt with a nutty-salty flavour, semi-sweet toffee (with a hint of cream sauce). The aftertaste got a slowly building bitterness, black coffee, mixed sweets, and fruits (peaches, pears) and a touch of roasted peanuts, caramel sauce and crisp bread.

Some metallic hints from the hops and a mild bready backdrop.  Taste: Wonderfully balanced between a biscuity, malty body and apricot/peach fruits, with a noticeable sweetness as the beer warms up.  Mouthfeel: soft, light carbonation means this is one easy beer to swallow. Hop tingle remains long after the last gulp.  Drinkabilty. Goes down easier than an Italian footballer in the penalty box.

Head retention is strong combined with a mild decent downward with a nice light frothy layer. Smells of a strong malt and bread like tint. Mild hint of floralness from the hops. Has a subtle hint of fruit or some kind of a fruity sweetness. Perhaps some underlying caramel tones. Tastes smooth and enjoyable. Nice malt flavor balanced with a mild dry hop finish.  The subtle sweetness is definitely from the malt flavors that are heavily present. Has a great easy to drink flavor. Nice mix of flavor. Extremely enjoyable and at 4.9% it has a decent ABV. I will continue to drink this beer and I find it to be scarce in many bars. This is a well crafty beer and has a nice overall mouth feel and drink ability.

Layers of sticky lacing make their way down the glass, making an appearance similar to a ringed-snake.  Musty malt aromas along with a light earthy hop aroma. Hints of honey like sweetness.  Very original flavors, some that I haven't tasted in any other beers. Starts off with relatively light malts, with light bits of noble hops. The finish is dry, but with more of a grainy malty taste. Sharp flavors come from the malts. The high carbonation in a lighter body gives it a crisp feel as well.  One-of-a-kind beer. Very complex and unique flavors can be found in this one. An American classic. Be sure to add this one to the list of beers to try.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

It could be a lot more malty but doesn't have much alcohol, a good call in my opinion.  Not a whole lot of complexity but I like it. Feels bubbly and refreshing in the mouth.

28,63,GratefulBeerGuy,4.4,"Bottle&gt; 16 oz. SA glass. This brew is a brilliant amber, totally clear, big carbonation that easily creates a mighty fine smooth, creamy and even white head that dissipates only a bit and leaves plenty of froth hanging around.  Caramel-sweet malt on the nose much like a vienna lager and with it's sour/sweet yeatieness. Very hearty scent as well with a spicey balance that is pretty aromatic. Way down there's vanilla and nutmeg.  The flavor at first is this honey-soaked breadiness with caramel and vanilla currents riding along side. Herbal, spicey and hearty flavors create a unique and even balance. The hop flavor is spicey and wheatie, not at all green or bitter. The last element is a roast beefy flavor that comes from the hearty wheat and herbal yeast effect. Still, a complex brew.  Medium bodied, big, clean crispiness and a delightful smoothness right at the end.  When this stuff is fresh, which can be rare here on the East coast this stuff is amazingly easy to drink and a real joy. An American original (with taste!)",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Lightly, sweet malt up front that is balanced by a citrus, bitter finish. Neither the sweetness nor the bitterness is over-the-top, creating a smooth and refreshing test.

These aromas were not strong, but pleasant.  The malt in the taste reminded me of some Euro pilsner malts, and the hoppy bitterness was strong.  The beer satisifingly coated my mouth.  The malt and the smooth mouth, makes this a pleasure to drink.

I've been drinking far too many hefe's (as mentioned by a previous reviewer) and this was a nice change. A very nice malty taste with only a very slight bite in the finish.

28,63,JerzDevl2000,4.38,"Picked this up recently to break out of the hefe's and witbier's that I've been enjoying lately. Summer's gonna end soon, and as the weather cools, I'll need to adjust to heavier and hoppier beers. Thankfully, this one has always been one of my old standby's, and it's always had a great drinkablity and timelessness to it. Before I really got into drinking craft beers and microbrews, this was one of the first non-macro's that I enjoyed, and to this day, it's still up there in my view!  Great pour - a very nice burnt orange hue to it, generous head, and lots of carbonation, to boot. The lacing could have been better, but that's about the only problem I have with this beer. The taste is simply amazing, in that it never hits ya over the head, but it very slowy and subtly grows as the beer warms and the serving gets further and further down the glass. Floral, citrus, metallic, leather, and hop notes can all be felt here, but the bitterness is not as overt as it is in Sierra Nevada's or Stone's offerings. The bitterness is just right, lingers nicely, and the carbonation and foaming in the front as I swish it balance it out perfectly.  For the summer - it's light and filling. For the colder months, it has a very nice warming effect without breaking me into a sweat. For the novice drinker, the 4.90% ABV is a perfect reason to use this as a session beer and an introduction into offerings from the West Coast. This is a less-spicy version of Anchor's Special Ale and just as solidly crafted as their other non-flagship offerings. I can't say enough great things about this beer. Just as Todd said, everyone should try this once!  P.S. - I love this bottle shape!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,SkeeterHawk,3.68,"Appearance: Pours a light amber color with a 1/4"" head of small off-white bubbles on top. The head fell slowly and ended up as a ring around the top of the beer within a minute or so. There are quite a few bubbles rising that keep the layer of bubbles on top of the beer for quite some time. There is quite a bit of Belgian Lace left on the glass after drinking.  Aroma: The aroma reminds me of light caramel and bread first off. There is a very distinct buttery quality to the malt. I do get some hops, but this is a subtle piney aroma deep in there somewhere.  Taste: The flavor also has that sweet caramel buttery malt thing going on. The hops are more pronounced in the flavor as compared to the aroma. The malt coexists with a noticeable metallic note...all the while this metallic has a slightly chalky undertone to it. The finish is pretty balanced with the malt being pretty much in charge, but it is challenged by the bittering hops and the water profile. Late in the finish, there is a defined fruity note taking over to linger. There is no alcohol noticeable.  Opinion: This is a pretty good beer, and the beer that defines this style. How can I take points off of it, because it is the style? Hmmm. Well, I will grade it based more on my interpretation of the melding of the flavors rather than how it fits the category. I like it, but wish that the whole water hop balance made it easier to drink. To my recollection, this beer tastes a lot better in San Francisco, so I would like to try it again there.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Anchor Steam pours a very nice red amber color along with a off white head that sticks around till you finish your pint. That ante's up the respect right there! The smell is floral and has an awesomely balanced complexion of hoppy bitterness and malt. Reminds me a lot of a Sam Adams Boston Lager, but with more flavor and craft. The taste is orgasmic in words. Has a carmel-like initial flavor and then heeds way to the malt, which is quite sweet. The mouthfeel is nice and heavy, makes you think twice about it being a lager! Drinkability is that of a hefe in my opinion, very smooth and balanced. The steaming process leaves it wickedly smooth, and I love it! Anchor pretty much re-invented this style of beers from the grave, and its added quite a unique beer to the styles of beer from around the world. It has the character of a hefeweizen and Vienna lager, which is a good mix to go with! Very tasty indeed.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

I picked up on some malty biscuit smells, along with a light touch of honey and carmel. Taste was very bitter, with the dark carmel and honey flavors showing up somewhere in the middle. Not too carbonated or big on the hops, but the malt bitterness makes up for it. Mouthfeel was light to medium bodied and very easy to drink. I see this beer as being somewhat of an acquired taste.

Starts off with almost astringent bitterness from either hops or toasted/roasted malts. Seems to lean more towards the hop end. After this the sweetness of caramel malts comes through. Then there's another round of bitterness, different from before. Almost like citrus. It all ends with more hop character. This beer has everything, it seems. It's not too light, not too heavy.

It's a difficult flavor combination to describe - it's creamy, yet a bit acidic. It's bitter, yet it's malty sweet. A unique flavor - it's been years since I've had an Anchor Steam, nice to be reintroduced. M: With the higher carbonation, this is a mildly prickly beer in terms of mouthfeel.

28,63,Liquids,3.78,"Finally a chance to try this classic, in the bottle. Pours a middle of the road, muted amber with a full foamy off white head. Lots of visible, small-bubbled carbonation. Extra points for leaving a dolop at the bottom of the pint glass, mmm. Smells very american, with distinct lager aromas. Also seems as though some of the hops are 'noble' though. A small amount of alcohol detected as well.  Taste...here comes the heresy. This reminds me of Sam Adams Lager. No, really. Actually, I had this for the first time on tap at a restaurant about two months ago, and after sipping it, I was convinced is was the wrong pour--tastes a lot like Sam Adams--maybe it's the Dos Equis by accident or they hooked up the wrong keg? I asked for a side sample to make sure it was the right pour, the waitress was accomodating, but the flavors matched. Idiot. So I assumed I was crazy, or they hooked up the wrong tap... But now drinking this, sure of what I'm drinking, I taste the similarity, it's there. It's milder than Sam Adams, slightly less hops and slightly more american flavor, a bit less salty, but in the same league. Certainly a bit fruitier and a bit more ale like, but these are subtle variations. Hops resins remain on the tounge. The malts flavor is gentle. Finishes rather dry also. As for mouthfeel, it's medium and rather carbonated on the tounge.  This is a good beer and even more drinkable than Sam. I like the idea of lagers at ale temps, but it truly is subtle variant for a lager.

There appeared to have a date marking of some sort on the back of the bottle, but it was ripped.  This beer poured a simple, light, clear amber with a finger of tan head that left a constant film of tiny bubbles. The nose was a direct malt tones. The flavor surprised. I've admittedly had this beer before multiple times, and enjoyed it each time, but I had not remembered such a well rounded, and deliciously (lightly) hopped brew. The beer is light - a good warm weather beer - and light on the pallette but still with a well balanced taste.

The beer hasn't changed, but I have.  Served from a bottle at 40 Deg. The color is a deep amber. My pint glass overflowed with a highly carbonated head that left faint lacing.I could detect the Northern Brewer Hop aroma, along with some grainy malt. The front end was a bit rough as this highly hopped beer is dominated by floral citrusy hops. The mouth feel was warm and smooth, but the malts struggled to get through. The middle mellowed some, but the hops had the last say. The finish was dry, crisp and bitter.  Anchor's flagship beer is still good, but I suppose my tastes have changed. I also wonder, if Anchor increased the hop bill a bit since the mid 80s, as I don't remember this beer being quite so hoppy.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

As I try to partake of the local offerings when visiting a city, I reverted back to Anchor Steam when a particular SF restaurant had a more limited beer menu. It's superior drinkability paired well with food or multiple pints in a session.

Some tea (malt) with lemon (hops), also. Diacetyl also seems to dissappear as ale warms. Normally diacetyl ruins a beer for me, but it is tolerable, even a little enjoyable here.

28,63,jettjon,3.88,"Highs: Mouth, flavor Lows: None  Sometimes it pays attention to know the background of the beer your drinking. Usually, though I try to judge a beer on its own merits. Anchor Steam Beer, though, shines on both counts. At first, I didnt really know what it was supposed to be. I was guessing a pale ale. As it turns out, its a great representation of the Steam Beer or California Common style. Either way, its a noteworthy brew.  Pours a clear amber color beneath a thick, creamy 2-finger head that fades away slowly leaving behind good lacing. Nose is mostly malt. Taste starts with semisweet malt but finishes dry on a bitter hopsy note. Presenting like an ale so far. Mouth is semi-creamy and smooth; quite good. Drinkability is very good. This is a substantial, tasty beer.  Overall: Never had a Steam Beer? This one presents like a great pale ale, with good flavor and a good mouthfeel. Very enjoyable. Recommended.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,RJLarse,3.47,"I picked up a couple of bottles of Anchor Steam beer at a grocery store to taste, review and enjoy. I poured this beer in to a pint tumbler.  Pours a pale amber color and is clear. A thick creamy head forms and is quite resilient. The beer appears mildly carbonated.  The smell is sweet and fruity. There is a floral scent along with an aroma of grain.  The taste is generally unremarkable. A heavy cereal or biscuit flavor up front, followed by a mildly bitter hop taste.  The mouth feel is dry and perhaps a bit flat.  This is a drinkable beer. Its a bit average in terms of taste, but a drinkable beer just the same.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,goochpunch,4.2,"Pours an amberish iced tea color with a frothy head. Looks like a bitter/pale to me. Some nice lacing present. Has aromas of a bready and malty body with a lightly hopped tinge along with hints of honey. Slight grain detected. Has a clean lager smell as well. Not much to say about the taste that I haven't said in the smell. Pretty much tastes like a solidly hopped pale ale but with a hint of grain and butter as well as a lager-like clean finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and soft. Drinkability is optimal as I just want to keep on taking sips of this.  This was the first steam beer I'd tried some years ago, and, to this day, it's really the only representation of the style I've ever had. I really have no complaints and, overall, this is a damn good beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,TheSarge,3.75,"Anchor Steam Beer pours quite nicely forming a light tan head, which stands for a considerable amount of time The body of this brew is a light amber color, and is highly filtered. A firm lace follows through till the last drop.  Anchor's beer is very fragrant. This is mostly from the toasty malts, and fine balance of hops. The flavor is malt dominated, but not overly sugary. It finishes with a hoppy ending... Okay, that was a bit cheesy, sorry.  This is a refreshing brew to have on a mild day between 65 to 70 degrees in the shade.  I like Anchor Steam quite a bit, because this company helped me to appreciate craft beer and American brewing altogether.

28,63,Brian700,3.63,"This one pours a clear amber color with a white head that settles to a thin layer and leaves some decent lacing.  The aroma is of sweet caramel malt with a mild citrus hop aroma.  The flavor is very nice. Good malt profile here. There is some caramel presence along with a clean hop flavor. Very well balanced.  The mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation.  This is a great session brew, very drinkable. I remember liking this beer more than I did this one. I will update review this one again when I get a bottle that I know is fresh.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,cjgator3,3.4,"Pours a clear copper color with a thick fizzy white head. Aroma is earthy malt. Taste is sweet toasted malt with a slight hop bitterness.

I will probably not purchase this again.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,mooner,4.37,"It's tough to find a fresh pint of this in Boston, but when in San Fransico you'd be hard pressed to find a more drinkable beer. As far as adhearance to style its much like Duval, didn't they invent the style? A great ale-like lager, I'm sure the best selling craft in America (Sam) owes a great deal of its popularity to this predecesor.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,akahn,4.08,"Pours a nice hazed amber, with lively streaming carbonation anda bubbly head. Decent lace.  Faint but deep caramel malt aroma tinged by subtle hops.  Interesting, unique, almost confusing flavor. Mildly sweet toffee-biscuit sweet, very toasty, with dry grain flavors too. Gentle tingle of hops plays well with ample carbonation, giving a long, gradually fading finish. The grainy flavors hover over all along. Delightful.  Medium body lightened by crisp, brisk carbonation. Becomes very creamy as it warms up. I'm very impressed  and perplexed! This beer ain't famous for nothin'!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,MiScusi,4.48,"The thing I love about Anchor Steam is that it is crisp, has a little bit hop pop to it, and has a nice mouthfeel. What you get is a somewhat lighter feeling beer that has a very good punch to it in flavor. You get a good dose of hops, on the level of a pale ale even. But there is a little malt caramel background that sets it apart from west coast pales. A very good refreshing choice if you are in the mood for this type.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,mdagnew,3.78,"330ml bottle bought from Grape Expectations, Ballyclare...  Poured a nice coppery amber colour... Slightly off white head pours quite small and faded quickly to light ring around the edge. No lacing...

28,63,jahsausage,2.66,"I suspect that I have got myself a skunked bottle or something here, its had to come a long way you understand. On first pour the beer looked beautiful with a nice coppery colour and decent head and smelt mildly of malt & yeast (it reminded me of homebrew). The taste itself I found quite subdued, perhaps what would be expected in a kiwi/uk style mild ale but the aftertaste was not to my taste. I found it not only lingering but astringent and sourish like nothing I have tasted before bar homebrewing disasters. I think I am going to have to reserve my judgement on this one until I can try a (hopefully) fresher bottle.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,becktone,3.28,"Anchor Steam pours a rich orange color. It is crystal clear and has an off white billowy head. Carbonation is visible, therefore bringing a lifelike appearance to the beer. First began with a two finger head, now down to about a finger and a half, somewhat good retention. The beer exhibits farily good lacing characteristics.  The nose of this beer is of strong sweet malts. Reminds me somewhat of candy,(however, not belgian candi sugar). Don't detect any hops in the aroma of this beer. The sweet malt smell is too upfront and in the face, I can't take much of it before I have to move the glass away from my nose, I think that it could be toned down a bit.  When it first hits the tongue bitterness if very evident, whether it was from hops or roasted grain I couldn't tell on the first taste, but it is very evident, right up there in the front car on a big rollercoaster. This beer is a big malt beer. While it is in balance between bitter and sweet, the main flavor profile is composed of sweet malts. Not much hop flavor in this brew. A little bit might be nice. Big on a darker caramel flavor.  The carbonation of this beer is forefront. It is highly carbonated. The carbonation can be felt up to the point where one swallows the beer. I'm not a big fan of that, seems to be a little too much if you ask me. This is a beer that I'll drink again, but I don't know how soon I'll be in the mood to drink this beer again. It is something unique, however, there are many unique beers that I have had that I might prefer over this one. It just doesn't seem to hit the spot, or any spot like a good beer (in my opinion) should.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,RedChrome,2.87,"Pour was a very nice almost orange color. Tons of carbonation help highlight the nice cream colored head. Almost no lacing.  Had a very hoppy aroma upon first sniff. Second whiff hints at fruity aromas that almost smell like a fruit salad. I noted hints of pineapple, lemon, apricot, and pears.  Not that impressed with the taste. This brew was to bitter even for my taste. The fruit wasn't in balance to the hops, which overpowered the whole flavor. Might taste fantastic with slighlty less hop.  Feels slighty watery but has a fair amount of carbonation that dances on the edges of my mouth.  If you don't mind the bitterness, this might be a good choice for you. It doesn'tfit my tastes, and unfortunatly, won't go onto my list of would drink again beers.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,ernie,4.88,"Certainly the best American beer I ever had. An incomparable one. It came on a hot sunny afternoon and made my day - hazy and crisp, hoppy and smooth, all in one. Fantastic drink, I wish it would be exported more widely. Anchor Steam can easily beat dozens of European premium lagers. But if San Franciscan brewers decide not to expand production for quality reasons, I can understand. Miss this beer, really.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Phocion,3.83,"Pours into a pint glass with a very reddish copper color and three good fingers of foamy head, which dissolves into a thin lacing. Lots of bubbles floating up to the top.  Fruity smell, with a bit of a sweeter caramel and a little bit of hops coming through.  Very bitter at first, tastes almost like a weakened PA for the first couple swallows. Starts getting a little fruitier as you work your way down the glass, and finishes off dry. Fairly complex, and very unique flavor.  Light-medium bodied, lots of carbonation. Nothing special here.  This is a highly drinkable brew. Excellent all-around beer that would compliment most styles of food or stand out well on its own. Best ""backyard"" drink I've had, and I usually try to keep a couple in stock for those times I don't know what else to have.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,wedge,4.3,"Clear copper with a frothy, chunky off-white head. Aroma is toasted caramel malts - creamy, nutty, and bready with a soft sweetness. Malty flavor with an earthy, almost minty hop bitterness. There's definately a solid toasted grain presence...a very rustic and leafy character overall that balances out quite nicely. Mouthfeel is medium-light and moderately dry.  Firm maltiness and delicious earthy hop flavors blend together cleanly to make a pleasant and highly drinkable lager. High on my list of all-purpose session beers.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,MeLikeBeer,3.8,"Pours a dark, golden amber color with a thick foam head that recedes quickly, leaving sticky lacing along the edge of the glass.  Smells lightly of hops and fruit.  On your first taste you get bitterness, but not an overwhelming amount. Very smooth on the tongue. Immediately after the bitter there is a sweet taste and I could detect hints of citrus fruit and caramel on the tongue.  Very solid beer. I could drink this beer frequently (and have been known to).",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,phishgator,3.34,"This poured into a pint glass with a nice deep amber/copper hue. The head is fluffy white and dissapates quite quickly. The aroma is of weak grains, very faint. The taste is o little bitter in the front and in the back. There is the balance of malt and hop in the body, but they just impress. The total brew could be a decent stand by at the bar where not much else is going on. Probably the only one of this style that I've had and I could just not know what I'm looking for.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,tastybeer,4.12,"Appears clear and copper with a small white head that leaves a nice ring of retention. Aroma isn't complex but its rich with sweet carmel-cream and woodsy malts. A hint of farm freshness with dandelions, leaves, and light lemon hopping. Taste is great with sweet leafy, gritty malts and tangy lemon dryness. The lemon and semi-sharp carbontion keep the beer swirling around in your mouth. Mouthfeel has a lot of nice texture too. Its grainy with clarity and has an overall smoothness. A pleasure to drink.  This makes a great session beer, all year round but especially during the warm months.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,wcudwight,3.8,"Had on tap at Murphy's in Boone NC. Pours a copper, amber, gold color with a 1/4"" white head that quickly dissapated. Mild hops and fruit in the nose. Maybe bannana.

Recommended.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Sosh,4,"Had this last night at a german-style restaurant. I got this kind of as an appitizer. Tasty. This was my first beer from Anchor.

The frothy head lasted all the way down and left a nice lace throughout.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Orrshow,4.12,"Appearance  Pours a copper/orange color with a decent amount of whitish frothy head.  Smell  Smells of sweet caramel malts, wood, and citrus hops. A nice combination in my books.  Taste  Caramel malts are present for sure. There is some graininess and astringent qualities as well. I detect some bitter citrus hops too but they are very easy going and dont overpower. The aftertaste is sweet and very soothing with just a hint of those hops.  Mouthfeel  This beer has a slightly tingly carbonation but its not enough to complain about. The body is excellentalmost creamy in a way.  Drinkability  Easy to drink rather its to gulp or to sip. It could be used for tasting or session.  Like this beer a lot. It was the first American craft beer I ever tasted (thanks to elricorico) and I enjoy returning for a visit here and there.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,WonderWoman,2.71,"I got this beer in a bottle and it came with a frosty mug. Once in the mug, the beer looked a light amber. At first it had a nice frothy head that soon dissipated to nothing. It smelled of a fresh cut lemon and a bitter hops with a few oats in the background. The taste reminded me of a watery red grapefruit with a metallic aftertaste that lingered far too long. Lacking carbonation, this beer had a very thin mouth feel to it. Over all, I thought I could do with out ever drinking an entire bottle again. However, I could take a swig here and there with out being totally offended.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,tgbljb,4.47,Poured a medium copper color woth slightly off white chunky head. Smell is a very enjoyable combination of malt with citrus notes. Taste follows through with a good malty character and a mild lemony note. Finishes with a good refreshing taste that is supremely enjoyable. Hard to believe I never had this beer before.I will definitely visit it again.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,SethB2,3.53,"Poured from a bottle into my Black Butte pint glass.  Beer pours a transparent ligh amber color with a nice two finger snow white head. Head disipates and leave a small amount of lacing. Smell is a tad on the sweet side and a little malty. Not a whole lot going on in the nose for me. Taste is good. Toasted malts followed by a better than expected hoppiness, providing a bitter finish. Mouthfeel is OK, but a bit thin and watery. Drinkabilty is good. This would be an easy drinker in session bender.  Overall, I like this beer, but I didn't have anything to compare it to. Not sure I've ever had another steam beer. So my ratings pretty much only reflect how I feel about the beer. In conclusion, for a lager that is fairly light in color, I was pleasantly surprised.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,bigdeuce,4.1,"There is nothing more refreshing than drinking an Anchor Steam on a hot day (yes, even outta the bottle) or more classic a microbrewed taste than this beer. This was one of my first microbrews and I fell in love with it immediately. It says, ""Anchor Steam"" to you while you consume it. Slightly malty on the front, mild hoppy kickback, great session beer, great starter for a new micro-drinker. Nice head upon the poor, decent lacing down the glass.

I only wish the aroma would catch up with the rest of the characteristics.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,GuinnessHero,3.48,"12 oz bottle poured into a Stemmed Pislner glass.  Appearance - A light ruby color to this beer. One-finger head develops that dissipates over the course of a few minutes. Very few signs of carbonation. Nonetheless, very nice looking.  Smell - Light with a touch of hops and maybe a hit of lemon.  Taste - Lemony with some notions of hops. Not very hoppy like my tastes prefer, but still good.  Mouthfeel - Fresh, and coats the pallet decnetly.  Drinkability - I can't drink this too much. Something about this makes it a bit undrinkable once it is halfway through the glass. Still a good beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Graebner,3.65,"Pours a brown-orange with a finger+ of white, meringue-like head that slowly diminshes, but never completely fades, and rejuvinates itself a little with each sip.  Smells like sourdough. Faint hints of spices and even fainter florals, and some smoky smells, but pretty much sourdough.  Tastes like peaches, rosewater, sourdough, and sports a very impressive hops presence. The hops are drying and bitter, yet quite pleasant.  The mouthfeel is also very pleasant. It starts out immediately sweet, but almost instantly the carbonation hits and tingles, and almost instantly afterwards the hops starts to dry out your tongue. Finishes nicely astringent, clean, and refreshing.  The drinkability would suffer a bit from the hops, which are somewhat out of balance, but you could sit down with a few of these. The price is what really does it in...at $10.75, it's one of the most expensive sixers on the shelf, and by no means one of the best.  A very good beer overall. Certainly not worth the price, but very good.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,sammy44,4.27,Tried this beer for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. Love the shape of the bottle also.  Poured a really nice copper color that seemed to have a chill haze on it. The head poured up real nice and fell to about a 1/4 inch with a good creamy texture.  Smelled of citrus hops and some toasty malt. Taste was really good as you were hit up front with some hop bitterness and then you got some malty sweetness and finished up dry and puckery. Excellent flavor.  What I really loved was the mouthfeel. The head was creamy and the body of the beer was full and heavy. Very good for a lager style beer.  I could have several of these and they might have to become a go to beer for the summer.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,SetarconeX,3.96,"Copper in color, and an astonishing amount of clarity. Can look straight through the bottle and see everything in the room on the opposite side. Not a whole lot on the nose, perhaps a bit of yeast.  Rather tasty, however. Lot of graininess in the flavor, with a hint of yeast and rather subdued hops. Finishes with a very slight dash of a metallic flavor which prevents me from giving it a higher score, but just so well balanced and drinkable that it more than makes up for it.  I'll definately be coming back to this one, perhaps fairly often. Tasty brew!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Some lacing that's more or less even around the glass. Clear and bubbly.  Smell: Very little hop aroma, almost non-existent to me. The prevailing aroma to me is malt or cream.  Taste: Hmmm...a very slight roasted, malty flavor with minimal hoppiness (or is that ""happiness""??) up front. It finishes with a pleasant fading bitterness, nicely balanced against the malt.  Mouthfeel: Nice, creamy, full-bodied feel.  Drinkability: This beer tastes very balanced which, to me, means I can drink this with no problem. The full-bodied feel will probably limit the drinkability for some.  I've heard so much about this beer, I had to try it. No complaints.

Mouthfeel: like a pale ale, good carbonation Drinkability: could drink more than one in a night, but don't wanna go back to back  This beer doesn't give you anything spectacular, but the taste is really unique, and it's one you can drink frequently and not get sick of it.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Smell: The beer smells like a cookie. The malts impart a sweet biscuitiness that are offset by a subdued hop nose.  Taste: The beer tastes like a rich, yeasty biscuit.

Taste is much like an ale, but still somehow clean like a lager, which makes sense after reading how it's made. Taste is fruity like an ale, but still quite crisp.  I really like this, I can forsee drinking a lot of this during the warmer months.  Slàinte!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Rezzin,3.88,"A - Amber copper color with a 1"" foamy head in my pint glass.  S - Not much nose to speak of but I've been drinking too many IPA's as of late so I think it's about right for this style. A bit malty and slightly sweet in the aroma with a faint alcohol aroma.  T - Not too bitter.. not too sweet.. but definitely on the more malty side. There is some hop bitterness but it's more of an earthy /fruity bitterness to me. Pretty much a 'down the middle' tasting beer - but it's not bad. This would be the perfect intro beer for BMC friends.  M - Clean tasting. For lack of a better term I'd say nice and smooth in the front and somewhat crisp in the back. That clean taste is something I enjoy with this style.  D - Definetly a sessionable beer and something I always have on hand for friends. I have no idea why I didn't review this earlier - I've had this sitting in my fridge for quite a while now. A good beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,scoobybrew,2.79,"This beer has a light amber color and when I poured it, there was a decent head retention. There is almost no aroma to speak of, mostly malt with a hint of alcohol and no hop aroma. The taste was a bit ""earthy"" with the malt dominating and slight hop bitterness, but then again, this might be the lager yeast (fermented at ale temperatures). The finish was clean, with a slight hop bitterness lingering. The consistency was fairly common.  Overall, a decent example of a uniquely American style. It was okay to share this with an Austrian friend who had never had this style before, but I don't think I'd be purchasing this on a regular basis (I would rather have Anchor's Liberty Ale, as my tastes lean towards the American Pale style...also, too much good homebrew to drink!).",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,DouggiePhresh,3.98,"Poured into a pint glass with a 1 finger head lasting 5 seconds. I love the color of this brew, it looks exceptional. At first sip, it tasted somewhat like an ale, but later it subsided to a malty taste. I think this would be an excellent session beer (I will find out tonight.) Not too much in the aftertaste, but quite refreshing",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,TrickKnee,3.65,"It is a little hard to describe this beer but i will take my best shot. There was almost no head at all, could have been the way the bartender poured it.

28,63,mghotbi,4.47,"Poured a clear amber-red with short-lasting two finger head and moderate lacing with prominent carbonation.  Caramel malt nose with traces of vanilla and banana - very pleasant  Smooth on the palate. Carbonation is perfect.  Hop bitterness hits the tastebuds first, followed by wisps of banana, dates and trace of vanilla, then a more definite malt sweetness and emergence of crisp hop and citrus notes with a long spicy hop finish. This is a unique beer - a delicate blend of contrasting flavors in perfect balance.  This is the beer that changed my attitude about beer. Very drinkable, makes an excellent and refreshing session beer, but it's can be an acquired taste for some folks. Serving this beer too cold can make for a bitter experience.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,scottoale,3.5,"From the funky shaped 22oz. brown bottle pours a deep, honey-amber, slightly hazy brew with a foamy inch+ of off-white head. After a couple minutes the head subsides leaving some nice lace on the glass.  Nice barley malt nose, kinda earthy and toast like with notes of yeast, wheat, faint tobacco and hops. The hops smell a bit grassy.  The taste is much like the smell with some black tea, more tobacco and a matallic twang in the finish. Pretty tasty stuff, not too sweet at all, very well balanced with a crisp, clean finish. Alcohol is well hidden.  Medium body, good carbonation give a nice smooth, cream like mouthfeel, then a bitter dry ending as it disappears.  Very drinkable, worth a try.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Taste is rather crisp and malty with just a slight fruitiness from the warm fermentation temps. Has a nicely balanced hop bitterness but the only trace of hop flavor is a mild suggestion in the afteraste. Finishes quite dry.  Meduim body, plenty of carbonation.  I can always drink one (or six) of these. This is the standard for the style, as they created it.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,allengarvin,3.58,"Pours out a clear golden amber with a light head of froth. Some lacing on the sides of the glass. Grainy nose, lightly toasted. Moderately malty start with a fair hop bitterness. Hops are a bit floral, perhaps a tad citrusy. Clean finish. Neutral, crisp texture, medium mouthfeel.  I've never found the ""California common"" style very interesting, which I guess is why I never got around to reviewing it to now. A drinkable beer, but not much that makes it stand out. Other interpretations that are good tend to rely on good malt character or interesting hops. The character of lager-at-ale-temp yeast just doesn't produce interesting flavors, in my opinion.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Metalmonk,3.93,"Popped two bottles and poured into a .5L Pilsner Urquell glass. Got a finger-thick creamy, spongy head that halved in a few minutes. Clean amber color with constant bubbles running up to the head. Small dottings of lace.  Smell is a well-balanced but super-subtle combo of malt and hops, with an even milder fruitiness and a brown sugar/caramel sweetness way back. It reflects what you get in the taste: all the above, with the hops slightly dominant, and better than the somewhat muted aroma. Feels tingly in the mouth yet there's a creaminess balancing it out, and that creaminess is more pronounced as it warms.  A simple, uncomplicated beer with no real negative traits. A sensible session beer choice, favored over many equally low ABV beers that can only claim a fraction of the quality.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,shamus,3.26,"I had great expectations for this beer and it's legendary status which perhaps is why it turned out to be a disappointement.

What I got was fine.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,bennetj17,3.66,"On-tap served in a pint glass. Copper hue, slim head of white foam, good carbonation present. The aroma was quite faint with a light maltiness. The taste is nice, not particularly sweet, but somewhat nutty and semi-bitter. Alcohol does not appear strong. Crisp mouthfeel and finish, light bodied, but not watery, it goes down easy.

28,63,jwc215,3.5,"This beer pours a a light amber color with a relatively thick head that fairly quickly becomes a thin lace. There is quite a bit of carbonation at first. But that too disspipates after a brief time. The smell is light. After smelling it, I wasn't sure what to expect, maybe a hint of caramel flavor. Nothing special, but nothing offensive. The taste is thick but without much of a distinct flavor, except a bit of refreshing sweetness. Tastes good but nothing special. It does leave a refreshing feel in the mouth, as there is nothing offensive, while nothing special about it either. Overall, it is a decent session beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Phatz,4.01,"Appearance: This beer pours an Orange-ish brown color. Large carbonation bubbles lead to a nice head.  Smell: I got very little out of the aroma. but in the beers defense it was served to me at the bar way to cold. I let it warm as much as I could. I was also sitting in outdoor seating. Nonetheless, I only got a hint of sweetness and some carbonation in the nose.  Taste: I have never had a steam beer before and I enjoyed this. The flavor was not complex or amazing but i was extremely drinkable. I was eating a Kilbassa and this was a perfect accompaniment. It had the nice sweet amber attribute to it. The sweet malts. but then it had a bit of hops. Gentle, laid back hops but enough to keep it interesting. I think there was a certain amount of smokiness to the beer as well. There were no fire works with this beer is was simple and drinkable. mmm.  Mouthfeel: Very crisp and active. lots of carbonation. Refreshing.  Drinkability: This beer is extremely sessionable.

28,63,vanrassel,3.63,"This isn't a bad beer  and forgive me if this sounds a little sacreligious to other BAs who have extolled its virtues  but I don't see where this beer got the rep it has.  It looks really good, pouring a rich copper colour with a nice foamy head that left plenty of lacing on my glass.  I smelled grassy hops with a slight caramel malt aroma. The first sip delivered hoppy bitterness that gave way to some sweetness from the malt. Nicely balanced with a dry, slightly astringent finish.  The carbonation is nice and lively and this beer is highly drinkable. I just wouldn't ever think of going out of my way for it.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,MEANxOLDxTOM,3.78,"Anchor Steam pours a golden amber color, and mine had a thin off white head that left a lacing around the sides of the glass. It has a musky sweet smell of malts, with ample hops to balance it out. The beer seems to have malty characters that hit the pallet first, and in the body significant hop characters(kinda resiny). The aftertaste is fairly smooth, but bitter at the same time. I felt like the bitterness was really strong, but as you drink the beer it becomes much less prominent. Mouthfeel: nice balance of malts/hops. The drinkablity grows as you drink it, I always want another when I finish the first. I had this conception that I really wasn't a fan of lagers, but to my surprise this is a lager...it has really changed my perception...I plan on experimenting with the variety a little more.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

This is a great gateway beer for friends and a wonderful session beer to have on hand.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,mcowgill,3.63,This is a true original. The beer pours an amber color with a nice head. The smell is a pleasing sweet malty aroma that I can't quite put my finger on.

This beer poured a golden amber with an ample white head that fades quickly and leaves a thin film the whole way down the glass. The smell is mostly pale malts. The taste is a very strong taste of pale malts but it is balanced nicely with some subtle hops. There is a good thickness and some strong carbonation that complements this beer nicely.

Has a thick creamy head that dissipates quickly.  The first thing that hits the tongue is a subtle sweetness, like caramel that just jumps up to do a quick jig on your tastebuds and quickly runs away, revealing a nice hoppy finish that lasts possibly a bit too long...like an in-law spending time at your house. you may like them, but there's a limit to how long you can stand them.  Mouthfeel is crisp, thin and biting and leaves a slightly dry feeling on your palate.  Special Note: do not drink this beer too cold. like many beers and wines, the flavors and aromas must be allowed to breathe. If you don't mind warm beer, this would probably be best at room temperature.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,skillerified,3.92,"Nice amber-red colored brew with a small, tan head. Lots of fast moving carbonation bubbles are clearly visible. Lacing comes in sheets, but breaks up quickly.  The nose very strongly favors a sweet malt scent. There are some fruit and floral notes hiding in there too. Just a touch of caramel too. Actually smells pretty good.  Flavor starts with an interesting and delicious sweet, warm malt. It's reminscent of bread or cookies of some sort. I can't quite place exactly what kind. It's tasty though. There's a touch of a hoppy, citrus flavor on the finish that balances nicely against the malt flavor. Not too complex, but tasty.  Starts sweet, but has a nice, subtle bitter bite on the finish. The carbonation is fairly aggressive. Well-balanced, but nothing too outstanding about the mouthfeel.  I don't see why I couldn't have another one.

Smells are floral from hops with a small bit of sweet maltiness. it's not an incredible smell, but is very solid and well balanced.  Taste is hoppy with a malty backbone, very balanced. Hops win the fight, but there is a caramel sweetness to it. Some orange citris to the hops as well.  Mouthfeel is good. medium body. carbonation was a little lower than i remember, but that is probably from the tap.  Overall just a solid american beer. Can't go wrong with it. great balance. Mmmm good.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,cracgor,4.6,"You ever say to yourself, I just want something that tastes like beer? That is the place this beer has in my heart. It pours out with a tiny white head. The body is an amber color with a decent amount of carbonation. Nothing like the streams in a belgian, but nice, and well beer like. It has a very clean beer smell. A light melon like hop and a tiny bit of malt. This beer never ceases to amaze me with flavor. Delicious hint of fruit, but mostly a perfectly balanced beer. The hops have a couple of layers. The first flavor I taste is very fruity, but it opens into a peppery flavor as it goes down, and just after, the flavor comes out as a piney/citrusy flavor. Very fun to drink and easy to drink. This is the jack of all trades of beers....you could drink it as a lawnmower gusler or a sipping evening beer. Goes great with food too.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Fragrantly light floral hops with just a touch of citrus. Rustic-tinged, semi-sweet caramel maltiness; earthen hops.  Moderate floral hop flavors balanced very well with the mildly sweetened caramel and toffee malt profile. A sweetened earthiness in the wheats and grains. Finishes crisp and dry with very little bitterness. A light citrus aftertaste.  A light medium bodied; earthy, grainy, and crisp on the palate.  A light, drinkable, and unobtrusive offering. Nothing that will blow you away in terms of flavor, but a version very indicative of the style.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Maybe it's memories of sessions with Anchor Steam or it just looks good... doesn't really matter, I love the look of it.  Aroma is malty/grainy/slightly hopped.

Tasted this with a cold, so I can't really comment on the smell, I haven't been able to smell much of anything the last few days...  Hops and molasses flavors come through strongest, but there's something else there that I haven't been able to place.

The aftertaste ruins this beer.  M - Carbonation too high, viscous, slightly refreshing, but the oppressive aftertaste ruins the prospect of true refreshment.  D - Pretty bad. I passed off the second half of my bomber. It just wasn't an enjoyable brew. I don't know about food pairings, I think there might be something with which it would be sucessfully paired, but I cannot envision it (might be the barleywine that I just drank). Sessionable?

Taste: caramel, bitter, very mild chocolate, smokey and sticky on the lipps. I could not notice any flavor coming from the yeast, so this must be a very clean one. Although I liked the beer very much, the full body prevents me from drinking another one in the near future, the style is just in between a very drinkable beer like Koninck or Palm and a speciality brew like Westmalle dubble, from which one is enough.

Incredibly smooth and luscious mouthfeel. So gentle and soothing, with carbonation hardly noticeable.  Alive and full of malt flavors. Slight hop bitterness in the finish. Like the smell, it contains a faint sweetness.  This beer gets a 5 not because it is the best beer I've ever had, or my favorite, but simply based on the style.

Appearance: Clear amber with an aggressive pour yielding a large off white & rocky head. slight & attractive beading, little lace with such a large head.  Taste: Same soft graniness with a resttrained sweetness. A subdued bitterness which finishes with some astringency. Some odd fruity tastes detected similar to green apples, a very similar taste I get from their Liberty Ale.  Mouthfeel: Light-medium body, expected it to refresh but a ""fluffly,"" airy texture makes it a bit difficult to quaff. Meh.

This particular lager is exceptionally complex in both smell and flavor, scent is hoppy, citrusy and floral. Tastes caramelly sweet, hoppy and fruity, finished with some hop bitterness and a little dry. This is one of my newfound favorite beers, will seek out in the future, would consider a new favorite session beer almost.

28,63,Tupperwolf,3.67,"I have always wanted to try Steam Beer but never got around to it due to my prejudice against 6-packs (prefer something different with every beer I grab) until I found a store selling the larger bottles.  Pours out looking like an ale... This is a lager? Well, yes it is, but not like other lagers. It pours a near crystal-clear orange-brown with a frothy yellowish head that builds higher than I expected and hangs out in a fat layer a lot longer than I expected. It also leaves really great lacing for a lager. Very nice looking, simply pouring this puts me in a great mood and sets me up to experience Steam.  The smell is thin, there is a little bit of honey and lemon zest. Kind of hard to make anything out beyond that.  Mmmmm, yum. Way more interesting than most lagers. It is indeed crisp, clean, and smooth, but is pretty flavorful. There's a lot of lemony zest and malty flavors, with just the tiniest hint of hops that are metallic in a light aluminum way.  Watery and crisp like a lager should be; Carbonation's about right. A little bit of tartness, and finishes quite clean. It's very, very easy and nice to drink.  Overall, this is a great beer and I'm glad the opportunity popped up to give it a shot.

Transparent amber with a balsa white head. Having one now poured from a bottle into a champagne flute. Poured with a four finger head which lasted for a few minutes. The head reduced releasing the pleasant aroma of this steam.  Tastes like it always does. Malty and lightly hopped. When I need old faithful, I go for Anchor Steam.  Feels like heaven.  Very drinkable.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,allergictomacros,4.19,"Pours light brown/deep orange color with a smallish head. Head dissipates quickly, leaving a bit of foam cover. Small bubbles rise continuously. Could use a bit more head retention.  Lots of aroma. Light hops and strong maltiness comes through. Some medicinal smells and breadiness I think it's called. :P  Taste reminds me of a solid APA, sweet up front with hops in the back. Good balance here. Understated carbonation is light on the tongue, and balances well with a slick, syrupy feel.  This is a beautiful session beer, IMO, which is good because I get it here in big 650ml bottles.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Toddv29424,4.22,"What a classic beer. There is an homage to this beer at the Magic Hat brewery in Burlington Vermont, and it is clear why. The taste is light but still full, with a crisp malt to it. Drinking it is really easy, especially if you are used to seeking out the more extreme varieties of beer, its a welcomed change. The smell has hints of wheat in it, but the carmalized notes peek through as well.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,kennyo,3.28,"At one time this was probably one of the better beers available to beer drinkers. For what its worth, it really is a good drinking beer, goes good with food or not. I would choose this over pilsners/exports/canadians and of course, the BMC conglomerates. This is a very expensive session beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,goschool,3.93,"I wanted to review this beer on Monday. I put a bottle in the freezer to chill it quickly, but I forgot about it and the beer froze. By that time, the rest of the six-pack had gotten down to the serving temperature in the refrigerator, so I grabbed another bottle. Immediately after pouring the second beer, I knocked over my pokal and spilled almost all of it on the rug. I cleaned it, Fabreezed the beer smell out and gave up for the night. This review is from beer number three. It went straight from the fridge into my glass and down my throat without passing 'Go' or collecting $200.  Pours a clear amber, with average-sized white head that leaves modest lace. The aroma is mild, but toasty malts fallowed by earthy hops. The taste is somewhere between a lager and an ESB. Hop bitterness overtakes the caramel malts, but nothing is terribly assertive. This is one of the beers, if not the beer, that started the craft beer revolution in America so it deserves its props and it's one hell of a session brew to boot.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,pbr85,3.85,"Poured from 12 ounce stubby bottle into a small glass  Appearance: Pours a golden brown color with a finger thick head that quickly diminishes.  Smell: Very weak smell. I smelled subtle corn and even weaker citrusy fruits.  Taste: Moderate hop backbone that gives way to a burnt toast aftertaste that lingers for a few seconds (couldn't come up with a better description). Citrus comes into the aftertaste as the beer warms up. Its a pretty good taste, nothing dominates, but nothing special stands out about it either.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation is good. The beer feels a little thin as it is going down, but as I have not had other examples of this style I am not sure if that is normal.  Drinkability: Though I would probably not consider this a session beer or anything close to that, it is an interesting beer with interesting qualities. I would have this beer again if it was available, but it is not going to be my new fall back beer.  Notes: I have never had a California Common/Steam Beer before, but this example is pretty good. I would recommend at least trying it, as it is a historic brew and a solid beer of its style (apparently).",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Kookiekwan,3.2,"This beer pours a clear deep amber has a one finger light tan head with excellent retention and a nice coating of lace on the glass afterwards.

28,63,atigerlife,3.78,"Way back in my college days, this was one of my favorite beers. It had been many years since I have had it, so when it was on tap at a pizza joint I was visiting, I figured I'd give it a go.  Poured a copper color with orange-yellow tones. A nice fluffy, creamy head. Good lacing.  Aroma was malty, but not very strong. Taste was quite flavorful with some hops bitterness. I found this surprisingly very dry and crips. Very consistent flavor throughout.  Mouthfeel was cleansing with medium carbonation. Overall, it was quite different than I remember [it has been over a decade since I last had this brew]. Not nearly as exciting, but this may have to do with the vast amount of other beers I have since tasted. For those who have not expanded their beer horizons, this would be a good introduction of a good American beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Muddybuddy,4.2,"Appearance: Honey colored beer with a good two finger head. Very clean and appealing to the eye. Head forms ""islands"" over a period of time but remains througout.  Aroma: Very floral and mild hops bitterness.  Taste: Brisk without being too hoppy, but definitely more than I expected. Mildly malty with a good balance to the hops. There is just a touch of biscuit to it as well. Overall it is a pleasing brew to me.  Mouthfeel: Kind of light on the tongue and slightly thin, but this is according to style and is actually quite quenching when paired with the lighter flavor of this beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,tavernjef,4.43,"Pale, clear light coppery color with a medium sized cap of off-white dense smooth foam. Settles down slowly to a healthy slim skim and collaring. Drippy lace with some globs sticking.  Aroma is softly clean and grainy with a slight toastyness; creamy, earthy tones keep underneath with a great fresh breadiness displayed on the nose the whole time.  Great fresh flavors, lightly malty with a nudging sweetness always peeking through with what tends to be an always present, fine bready toastyness. Creamy and lightly earthy with a tender texture and easy going malt base. The grain flavors are nicely handled with an eager mildness that lasts a long time. Finishes earthy with a slight grassy edged hoppyness floating along the end of the bready stuff. A great Steam beer by the innovators of the style, Anchor.  Sessionable by the gallons!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,arguemaniac,4.6,"Pours a dark orange/amber with a short-lived, light tan head that leaves a thin lace. Bready maltiness in the aroma and flavor, though the palate is a bit more complex: grain, caramel, a very mild roastiness, and some faint piney hops as well. The mouthfeel is wonderfully creamy with moderately active carbonation.  Not merely one of the best examples of the style, but arguably one of the best American beers on the market. Ive said it before in various forum posts and Ill say it again: this well-balanced, infinitely drinkable brew is THE perfect session beer. No one can claim to be a serious craft beer lover and never have tried this one! Highly, highly recommended!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Slight nuttiness in the malt flavor. Fresh and light.  T: Biscuit malt flavors are light but hold nicely as the grassy hop flavors finish off the beer. Very nicely balanced with a hint of citrus fruit in the hops of malt and caramel finishing a mild hoppy taste.  M & D: Mouthfeel is nice, not too bitter--has excellent balance.

Poured from a big, fat 650 mL bottle into a standard pint glass (had to refill, since it didn't all fit). A nice clear orangy amber colour.  Smell is hoppy, with pepper, flowers, and citrus fairly evident. Flavour is somewhat bitter with some earthiness. Hints of citrus, particularly lemons, and apples as well. Very light and smooth on the palate, with a slight bitter or acidic aftertaste and moderate carbonation.  Overall OK, but nothing special, and not worth the price charged at the LCBO.

28,63,pjwilson,4.3,"There are times when Anchor Steam just seems like the right brew to purchase among a sea of other choices. This was one of the first craft brews we used to drink in the swill days to mix it up. An American classic that everyone should try, and everyone should return to now and again. Appearance: light orange color and huge head as it pours into my mug. The head is very long lasting. This color seems rare in beers...it's not amber but not yellow...doesn't really look like a PA either. But it looks good Smell: Smells like American beer! (been drinking a lot of European beers lately). Nice grains and malts. Smells like a classic beer. taste: connects right with the smell. Has a real smooth, clean taste. Again the malts, but this time there is a mild bitterness to back them up. Perfectly balanced. mouthfeel: a mix of lager and ales. Why more brewers haven't attempted this style is beyond me....perhaps it's hard to get done right as it is a delicate style. It drinks like a lager but feels like an ale. Hard to explain. Drinkability: Really high. I spend a long time on this one and not get tired. All I have is a 22 oz. bottle at the moment. This is made to be an easy drinker. If I had a sixer right now, I would probably drink a whole bottle in one or two sips. But it still feels like it has some body too it...it's not a lager. This beer went very well with Mexican Food, and I suspect it would go well with almost anything. It's easy to forget about this one, but I make sure to get some every few months or so. My dad says he used to get this in the 70's (he still does.) Things weren't so bad in 70's for beer if this was around.

Anchor Steam, considered the granddaddy of steam beers pours a slight clear amber to off yellow shade with good head retention, nice carbonation and a slight lace to the glass. Do you think that Gottlieb Brekle imagine what he starte in 1854? The smell is stronger malt but limited hop and fruity esters are present.  The taste is a good combination of lighter malts with a full body flavor. Creamy almost but with a hint of caramel flavoring and then at the end a spicy kick. A small amount of floral is noticeable but you have to look for it. Anchor Steam is a nice summer beer and has a fantastic history.

Overall, it is not an overly aromatic brew. Flavor is prominently grainy, with a light caramel. A light hop bitter hangs on the finish. Nothing really grabs me and keeps my interest, though this would be a good transition brew for those just fining craft beer. Feel is moderate with a very active bubble on my tongue. The beer is smooth and very easy to drink. I'm not the biggest fan of the grainy nature of it. There is nothing flawed in it, but I don't think I would buy this one again.

I'd like to say the assertive hop bitterness is well balanced with the mildy vinous citrus flavor, but I can't judge the style until I review more of the same. I can say that the light body and medium carbonation make up a mostly smooth mouthfeel, but the spice/hop bite lingers and dries the finish enough to make the average rating for drinkability generous.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Smell: Dense grains and fresh vegetables. My nose is overwhelmed by those two characteristics. It's like no other beer I've smelled before. Kind of cool and very unique.  Taste: Starts off kind of citrusy and then fades to dark grains quickly. Finished with a wheatbread kind of aftertaste. A little bit of hop bitterness here and there and usually at the beginning of each taste.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and a touch oily with a longer finish.  Drinkability: Easily poundable.

Taste continues with the toasted barley malts, caramel, a sliver of citrus, and an elusive hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, medium bodied, and moderately crisp.

First taste is unique to say the least; very distinct. Roasted malt is upfront with a pepper spice aftertaste.

Plenty of dry hop bitterness in taste and mouthfeel... smells sweeter than it is. Mostly well balanced but hops wins out. Strikes me as a hybrid between a lager and a dry brown ale.

There were some hints of strawberries and a tinge of malty sweetness on a few swigs when the pint was half full (or half empty, since I'm giving a negative review), but that was a brief respite from the experience of swigging this beer. Steam (aka California Common) is a style unto itself. I don't have much interest in it, based on this beer. It tastes more or less like a generic lager.

28,63,LordChesterfield,4.3,"HEAR THEE HEARTHEE, i'm drunk on this beer...  Most of these fellows don't even know what type of beer their reviewing. This beer uses lager yeast and was brewed at ale temperatures! Unique genre! STEAM, not ale, not lager, but the best of both worlds. Flavorful and clean and refreshing. The only important atribute with this beer is its exquisite balance of hops and malt. This balance carries through to every facet of the tasting process. The end result is lots of flavor and lots of drinkability. A middle of the road beer that is sure to satisfy most who don't prefer one extreme or another. My personal review on the brand- Anchor owns the rights to the name ""STEAM."" This is like owning the word ""ale."" This is absurd and usually unnoticed, so if you can find a steam beer of equivelant quality, buy IT instead. I love this beer with all of my heart. Too bad it costs $8 a six!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,swid,3.68,"Anchor Steam pours a light amber color into my pilsner glass. A 1/4"" head forms, and slowly dissipates. Medium carbonation, little lacing. The aroma is fairly restrained; there's little here beyond some generalized malty sweetness and a mild floral/spice hop aroma.  Forunately, the taste is better than the smell. The malt and hops are nearly perfectly balanced; I can find caramel, chocolate, biscuity, floral, and spicy flavors. The mouthfeel is light, and slighty dry; finishes a combination of ""sweet, crisp and slighty spicy"". There's some unspecified harshness in the aftertaste that I can't quite pin down (which may be due to the age of this particular bottle).  Anchor Steam is a refreshing, enjoyable beer (and virtually the only example of its style on the market). It may be slightly overrated due to its ""cult classic"" status. On the other hand, it did single-handedly keep a style alive; overall, it's a good crossover craft beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,pootz,3.95,"I have decided to delete my previous rating because Im sure I got spoiled samples. The sample I am tasting now was bought from a hotel consignment. According to the date code this beer is 3 weeks old. This was fresh tasting beer. Poured a deep amber color with a nice fluffy 2 finger cap which retains a good lace on the glass. Medium carbonation. Aromas of sweet crystal/caramel malts and grassy hops..very pronounced aromas. Full bodied beer...chewy toasty malts with spicy hopping that goes slightly drying in the finish and lightly bitter in the after taste. All in all this a good session beer...well made, quaffable, full bodied and satisfying.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Vancer,2.61,"The ol standard, eh? Well, it did have a nice pour- amber /orange with a foamy tan head. Only a slight malt aroma. But the taste, not good. Not much in the way of malts or hop. Just some earthy, slightly bitter flavor. Kinda flat in the mouth. Boy, overall a dull & boring lager. Wasnt offensive, but didnt do anything for me.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,kbnooshay,3.75,"I got a 20 ouncer of this on tap. This pours a really nice dark copper/amber color with a nice uneven off white head. The aroma is sort of caramely and malty. The taste is similar, with sweet but light brown sugar flavor. The taste is fruity but also contains some good hoppage. THe spicy hops balance out the malts nicely.  This is a unique and in my opinion an above average beer. Lots of character to it. The mouthfeel is moderate, almost creamy. I could have a good amount of this.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,claytri,3.88,The beer poured a fine amber with an eggshell head. The aroma was a blast of malt and floral hops. The taste was of hoppy malt with many floral and fuit hints in the finish. the feel was a full bodied beer that was fairly oily with a well proportioned hop finish. This was a pleasant experience I enjoyed the beer and it went well with the meal providing a nice counterpart to calimari and fish giving a good cleansing.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,palliko,3.97,"Appearance is reddish brown with a beige head of thick foam that lasts and sticks to the glass. Aroma contains loam and malt and brown sugar.

Decent head retention with lacing that slides down the glass.  Smell: Fruity with a hint of metal. Sourness as well.  Taste: Fruity at first, then asprin-like hops kick in. Finish is burnt bitter. Aftertaste is buttery and burnt. Definately a different taste. Pretty good too.  Mouthfeel: Somewhat thin. The buttery aftertaste is a plus though.  Drinkability: Very good.

28,63,BEERchitect,3.53,"When I started homebrewing, a lot of those first pale ales carried this same twangy yeast flavor that I chalked up to that ""homebrew"" taste. Mixed with the medium caramel flavor and fruity esters, I taste many of those same flavors in this classy ale.  Light copper and with orange highlights, this hybrid beer carries the appearance of creaminess, bright clarity, and decorative lace. Good retention and residual pockets of foam are fueled by steady streams of carbonation throughout.  Thin caramel, medium barley grains, bread crust, slight English-like fruitiness, and hop elements of woods and grasses give a richer sweet tea herbal scent to the appetizing nose. The aromas are not as pronounced as an American Pale Ale, but it's easy to draw come comparisons.  Caramel, light toast, softly kilned grains, and bread crust also show in a medium sweet flavor, and again with the added complexity of light yeasty fruits of apples and oranges. Earthy hop flavors of bark and leaf frame the balancing flavors at mid palate, while ushering in a clean and somewhat minty bitter taste in finish.  Creamy sweetness allows the early mouthfeel to be more pronounced due to an abundance of expansive carbonation to start. As the carbonation subsides, so does the sweetness. A mid palate of developing grassy, bitter, and resiny dryness starts to take hold and leads to a crisp and grainy-dry finish that is mostly clean even with the earthy hop elements and slight astringency of grain husks.  I keep finding flavors here that remind me of both Pale Ales and German-style Vienna lagers or richer Oktoberfestbiers. Very drinkable, enjoyable, and effortless in its session-ability. The rustic charm of grassy hops, strained yeast, and somewhat clumbsy brewing practices are also what gives this hybrid beer its charm.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

I originally tried Anchor Steam in San Diego a couple years ago, before I had any idea what I was doing, beer-wise, and didn't like it.  I have since seen the light. Anchor Steam is a wonderful beer. First of all, its bottle shape and label design are perfect, and once in the glass it looks about as beautiful as a beer can look. Perfect amber color, slightly cloudier than the Old Scratch, with a nice white head. It smells and tastes very creamy, feels full and soft, and is quite refreshing. Slight bitter aftertaste. I can see why this beer is a classic.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

The words that come immediately to mind are: Bright, crisp, dry. Taste is bitter hop with undertones of fruity malt. The aftertaste is dry and hoppy and lingers for awhile, but not too long.  Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, but very fizzy. Too much carbonation in my mind.  An interesting blend of hops and malt, but the hoppy-bitter bite is a little harsh for my liking. The first time I had this was at a fish and chips joint in Crescent City, CA and went really well with my meal, but I've had it a few times since and can't say I'd consider it much more than an average session beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Not complex, but pleasing.  The first sip hits big with strong bitter piney hops over a round and toasty malt center. I taste bitter orange peel. A dense bitter ending yields to a gently herbal aftertaste.  It's creamy smooth, seems medium-bodied and has a fine mouthfilling carbonation. Robust and refreshing. Absolute assertive excellence.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Sycodrummer,2.29,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass yielding a small 1/2 finger white head atop a light copper colored beer. The head quickly faded to nothing and no lacing during the sample.  It was hard to detect (or at least come up with a good comparison) to describe the smell. Rather bland with slight malt, but nothing distinquishig it at all.  Taste was bland as well. Slightly bitter and hoppy with some fruitiness as well coming through. Not much to talk about, it lacked any really great taste.  Light to moderate on the palate with ample carbonation.  This beer didn't seem to do it for me. I know Anchor pioneered the style and name ""steam beer"" which led me to believe this is the ultimate of the style; if so, then this style is not for me.

Smell is dominated by malt with a grainy smell backed up by a fruity esters aroma, not really complex or inviting. Taste is a nice blend of malt and hops, this really is a unique beer and theres not really any other beer you could compare it to. The flavor is bready malt flavor with a light caramel sweetness and a lightly bitter floral hops finish. This beer has a full body and mouthfeel even though its a lager (kind of), and there is a lot of carbonation which makes the beer more refreshing.

Smell: Hoppy and fruity aroma, although mild.  Taste: The first drink is very hoppy, but subsiquant drinks are much milder. Fruitiness is also mild. This beer has a rather complex flavor.  Mouthfeel: Nice dry finish.

Some of the woody characteristics the BJCP tells me to look for, but I wouldnt have caught it on my own.  Appearance: Amber glass capped with a light tan creamy head that laced. Clarity good.  Flavor: Hops really pop in the taste. Id say pale ale, but the woody taste really makes a difference. It is slightly minty. There is a firm malt base that accents the hops nicely.  Mouthfeel: Body is light medium, carbonation level is fairly high, has a nice smooth texture and a lingering tingle.  Overall Impression: A good summer beer.

Taste begins quite hoppy, maltness joins in the middle and finishes on a bitter hoppy end. Can feel the the hoppiness on the back of the tongue long after taking a nice sip.  Drinkability is excellent, very crisp and flavorful, a nice replacement to your usual lager...you will not be disappointed!!! The end flavour on your tongue is quite bitter but if you like a hoppy beer you will fall in love like I did.

28,63,ColForbin,3.88,"Anchor Steam is the beer that defines the California Common style, but that doesn't mean I have to rate it perfect, does it? It pours a deep gold with a slight tinge of red and a light tan head that provides some nice lacing on the glass. My allergy hampered nose detects some piney, spicy hops. Taste is quite crisp and bitter, with a firm maltiness in the background. I guess the hallmark of this style is ale aroma with lager crispness, and this beer has that in spades. Very drinkable.  One day I would like to try this closer to or at the brewery, because I imagine that when fresh the hops are that much more assertive and the beer tastes that much more crisp.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Most noted taste was that of hops and barely, with a smooth maltiness detected. Finished slighly sweet, and a touch dry. A helluva good beer.

28,63,DrJay,4.07,"Slightly hazy deep amber colour topped by an off-white head. The rocky foam thinned to a decent lace after a few minutes, which stayed supported by moderate carbonation. Yeasty aroma is prominent to start, but becomes quite mild after breathing for a short while. Moderate maltiness supports a minty, earthy hop aroma and a light fruitiness. Nicely balanced flavour with malts and minty/lemony hop flavour to start leading into some drying bitterness towards the finish. Medium body and not as carbonated as I expected based on the appearance. Overall, the slight mintiness was a delightful surprise.  650 mL brown bottle with freshness code stamped on the rear label.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

If I think really hard, I can almost smell the SLIGHTEST hint of amaretto. Carbonation level is right on. Plenty of bittering hops in the flavor, but not much as far as flavor goes. Not to say there is a lack of flavor, only somewhat as far as the hops go. Nice and clean and well balanced, with a nice lingering bitterness left behind. Good beer for hot summer nights.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,danielharper,3.28,"Purchased from Great Spirits, Huntsville, AL.  After reviewing the Flying Dog Old Scratch, I figured I might as well take the last of my current sixer of Anchor Steam and write up a review. I believe this was the first of the commerically-available American microbrews, and thus deserves a shot from the craft beer drinker just for historical interest.  Appearance is quite nice. A kind of ""squat"" brown bottle with a simply-designed but pleasant Anchor label on it. The label is unlaminated, without the glossy finish that most beers have -- gives the bottle an old-fashioned feel to it. Beer pours into a lager glass with a light amber color, and a large head that slowly dissipates. I've had this beer in a pilsener glass before, and the head seemed to stick around forever in that instance.  Smell is nice, if uncomplicated. Kinda hoppy, kinda spicy. I've been sniffing at this for a while, but have yet to get any noticeable fruit aroma from the glass.  Tasting the beer, ah, now there's the fruit I was missing. It tastes a lot like it smells, with the hoppy/spicy combination that works pretty well for this beer, but after washing away the dominant bitterness, some of the liquid flavors appear underneath. I like to wash my tongue through this to get all the flavors out of it.  Mouthfeel is nice. Carbonation is fairly high but not extreme, although the beer could use a bit more body. Works well as a lager to wash down food, although the spiciness in the brew might tend to overpower dishes that aren't strong enough to hold up to it.  For me, the drinkability is fairly low just because while I like the individual parts of the beer, and can respect it for what it is, I don't find myself wishing for another afterwards. Perhaps the bitterness and the spiciness just don't add together for a refreshing experience, but I find myself wanting something a bit smoother after finishing this beer. I usually have this beer first in the evening, while preparing food or eating it, and finish off the meal with a Hefe-Weiss or a Milk Stout.  Overall, a nice beer -- I'd recommend it to friends looking for a change of pace from a macro lager, but nothing that I'd put on my favorites list. I will certainly buy this again (and I'd love to try it on-tap), but I won't be pining for it in the meantime.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

The smell while it is cold is just a waft of a little malt and citrus aroma. But as it warms up a bit the malt aroma sweetens to almost an candyish degree.

There was a nice spice to the hops, but nothing as harsh as the IPA's I generally tend to drink. Disappeared very quickly, wasn't much of a session beer, I just drank it quickly, very quickly.

Smooth and flavorful, there are some fruity notes matched by a bitter, almost sour taste. The bitterness really sticks around for a while creating a powerful aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good, not too light and not overly heavy either.  This might not be the most drinkable beer I've ever had.

28,63,rousee,4,All 4's here. Orangey-amber-good carbonation action-small head that holds well. Malty buttery apples and hops. Some caramel taste too. Taste is dry and not as bitingly bitter as I remember-there is a nicely balanced malt/hops blend. Some slight fruitiness. Dry mouthfeel --quite smooth and drinkable.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Luigi,4.5,"Pours out perfect amber, clear with moderate carbonation bubbles racing towards the top. The head is a fluffy two finger to three fingers high (depending of glass size.) that retains great. Sticks all around the glass. Off white is color.  The aroma is a balance between the clean toasted malt and the mild spice from the hop.  The taste is well crafted. A perfect toasted caramel malt flavor blended with a slightly bitter citrus hop.  Easy to drink medium body with some mild carbonation.  This is hands down one of the best crafted lager on the market, well worth the extra dollar. I can enjoy this brew any time.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,BamaScholar,4.3,"Pours a topaz/amber color with a good mother-of-pearl head (not sure what's up with the gemstone descriptions).  Has a pleasant floral aroma and a grassy earthiness. Malty and solid taste , fuller than I expected given the color. The graniness and slight bitterness are well-balanced with the floral overtones.  This is very enjoyable...accomplishes balance of flavors well, like Thai food (there even seems to be some saltiness. I would reach for another!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,charlatan,2.78,"Bought this on tap at Madame Butterfly Restaurant in Portland.  The straw to amber colour was lighter than the beers I tend to prefer. A creamy head added to the feel, particularly early on.  The nose was of a rather dim, bitter type of creaminess, reminding me of Boddington's Bitter which I have never been particularly fond of.  I haven't sampled a beer like this in a good while. It struck me as rather diluted (I prefer a much fuller flavour), yet at the same time dry.  The hops delivered a decent degree of bitterness, but were rather one dimensional, and didn't mix well with the creamy malt. This is a combination which makes little sense to my palate.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,karst,4.05,"This Steam beer is a clear copper color and an off-white head foams up 1 cm. hangs around and evently fades to a surface layer near the end. Aroma is mostly malt, some hops, well balanced.  Provides a nice carbonation with an above average body. The beer gives some sweet caramel up front and then gives way to west coast hop finish that is delightful in in their acidity and delectable in their spiciness, dry aftertaste taste along with little bit of grainy flavor.  This little beauty is crisp, refreshing and very easy to drink. Session beer par excellance! I am amazed that nothing under this style rates above 4.0 average. ""I don't get no respect""... Rodney Dangerfield.  Worthy of a 4+ IMHO",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,neonbrown82,4.03,"Had this on tap at my favorite watering hole. It was quite tasty and refreshing, but I couldn't imagine drinking this for too long because of the overbearing sweetness. Nonethess, it was delicious. I might have to pick up a bomber in the near future.  The beer was an amber color with a generous frothy white head that stayed to at least a quarter inch through the pint. The smell was quite fruity and malty. I couldn't quite place the taste, but it was almost tropical. Like I said, quite delicious and refreshing at first, but towards the bottom of the pint it is damn nigh too much. I will probably drink more in the future, but I definitely couldn't foresee this being a session brew even though it is under 5% ABV.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Fish113d,3.65,"Pouring into a pint glass at about 50 degrees (F) it pours a deep amber color w/ 1 cm of frothy tan head w/ lots of cling to my glass. It also appears a little cloudy at first as well. Smell is of sweetness- cherries or raisins malts maybe. However, no hops or dark malts other than fruit, nothing too special. Smooth vanilla cherry flavors up front with some hops to it and then a little more hops on the finish; a little watery also and not too complex. However, this is a very decent beer to drink. Prickly carbonation that sticks to the tip of your tongue on the sip and then follows the contours of your tongue even after the swallow (lots of carb!). Light-medium bodied; mild and smooth and very easy to drink a whole lot of them!!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,stjarnflikka,3.5,"Pours a clear red-orange beer with a fingerthick foam and some carbonation.  Smell is malty, somewhat flowery with oranges to aid it. Some fizzy carbonation goes in there to, mainly fresh and nice though.  Taste is at first malt. Citric hops goes together with a somewhat bitter tone to create a nice feel. Somewhat bready and alcoholic, and it finishes with citrus and a long rough bitterness with some spices.  A nice brew by a great brewer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,steinlifter,4.18,"This poured a dark golden, sudsy head that diminished quickly, but left a collar all the way through, smell was a bit woodsy, with slight fruit aroma, taste is of well balanced mild hops and malt, bit of apple notes, and a bit spicy, mouthfeel is well carbonated, a bit of chewiness, but very mildly so, finishes very smooth, drinkability is excellent, this is a great session brew,I can't believe it has taken me this long to review this as I have had this many times now, I really like Anchor Steam a lot!!!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,santoslhalper,3.12,"Appearence: Pours a clear copper with a decent sized white head. No lacing, and little carbonation.  Smell: The smell is a very earthy malt smell. The hops back it up nicely and the yeast is also very present in the nose.  Taste and Mouthfeel: The taste is mainly of malts, and not ones that are all that flavorful or complex. The hops barely make a statement in the mouth. The flavor is bland and uninviting. The mouthfeel is thin but smooth.  Drinkability and Overall: Again, Anchor has left me down. First the OSA 04, and now this. I have yet to try their Bigfoot barelywine, but I have one waiting for me in the cellar. Hopefully it's better than this bland beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,TackleDummy,3.45,"It pours a copper color with a minimal off-white head. The head lasts for quite a while and leaves creamy white lacing on the glass.  The aroma is that of malt with a bit of citrus.  The flavor starts with a bit of a hop bite and a slight malt flavor, and finishes with a citrus taste with a decent amount of bitterness.  The mouth feel is pretty light and just a little creamy, and it goes down smoothly.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,quasimoto,3.99,"First off, I love the way the beer produced one of the best heads of foam I've ever seen. The color of the beer was a nice dark copper. I liked the malty smell, and how the hops are only really distinctive in the taste. It also had a suprisingly somewhat creamy feel. Other than that, it would make a nice brew for a warm summer night.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,beersarang,4.11,"Gorgeous beer. Copper colored with a beige head that becomes rather rocky. The lace is intermittent.  Smells almost metallic, hoppy.  Taste is hard to describe. This beer is not bitter per se, but the malts are seemingly overwhelmed by the unique hops. This beer has a mild beginning taste with a bite towards the end, which fades into an aftertaste that is quite pleasant and smooth.  Carbonation is evident in mouthfeel, lighter to medium bodied beer.  Drinkable, to be sure.  I do like this beer. One thing I can say is that there is no beer that is even close to it. Everyone says it is unique, and everyone is right. A great beer to have around; it shows what America is capable of brewing.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,LiquidBreadMan,4.2,"This is Anchor Brewing's second-best offering, in my opinion -- and it's a top-ten among American made microbrews.  Anchor Steam pours a deep copper with an average life off-white head. Its aroma is fruity: meyer lemon and grapefruit, with an essence of roasted malts and hops. The taste is a similarly complex balance of flavors with a quick bite of hops, sweet malts and a citrus finish. Mouthfeel is a little dry, which is good in my book. This beer's drinkability is better than most I've tried, regardless of style.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,elricorico,3.69,"Pours a crystal clear copper colour(how's that for alliteration?) with a touch of off-white head. It smells good, seems to me that it has a citrus smell, with a baked bread aroma and a sweetness not unlike brown sugar.  Has a fresh citrus taste to start and a mild hop finish. Hints of sweetness within the starting, but nothing overpowering.  Decent mouthfeel. without heavy carbonation. Has a little bit of body to it, it doesn't feel thin. This beer is quite drinkable, when finishing one it seems that another is a good idea.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,mynie,4,"Pours rust-colored with a very nice head that sticks around. For some reason I figured this would be blonde...  Steam hops on the nose, light citrus along with a harsh, almost rye malt scent. Nice.  Tastes more or less like it smells. Sweet, toasted malt upfront with the citrus of the hops coming in on the back.  This beer is juuust right. A great session ale that goes down easy and doesn't rape your mouth,",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,BeerBob,4.15,"Anchor Steam Beer pours a rich deep copper from a dark brown 12oz glass bottle. Head goes well over two fingers and is off white, thickly packed with small firm bubbles that regenerate from the beer below. A generous lacing of foam covers the side of my glass, giving it a world class picture of a well laced beer glass.  Nose is of hops and sweet malt in pleasing and fragrant amounts. Palate is toasted sweet malt, thick and creamy with a well bittered hops presents. There is a floral profile to the hops, but not the heavy kind but rather soft and well balanced with the sweet malt. Anchor Steam Beer reminds me of a good German Märzen.  A well made brew awaits you from Anchor Brewing, no skimping here, and not watery in the least. See it on the shelf, take it from the shelf and buy, it will not disappoint.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,orbitalr0x,3.83,"Had this one on-tap w/ dinner tonight. Came to me with a nice golden amber color, but not much head to speak of. I'll blame that on the pour. However, it made up for it with some nice lacing cascading down the glass. A nice citrusy hop nose with some bready sweetness.  Sweet, cirtus/lemon hops mix in with a nice sweet caramel, bready malt. Nice balance and quite tasty.  Mouthfeel was a bit thin but that makes it all the more drinkable. A good session brew. I've never had this in the bottle, but I look forward to trying it.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,MuddyFeet,3.46,"This is a lot different than what I remember from when I was in SF. For some reason I had the distinct memory of sour dough bread and not particularly liking it. But then again that was a few years ago and my tastes have changed since then. The beer poured out of the bottle with a finger-width head on top that dissappeared down to a thin film with a lace that clung to the sides of the glass. The color was a burnt, clear copper. The hops are not overly complex and roll over the tongue very smoothly. However, I did notice slight hints of lemon and sugar. But what gets me is how much smoother a beer it is now than what I remember.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,KoG,3.53,"Had a nice rich gold color with a good amount of creamy head.  Smell was malty with hoppy esters. Couldn't pick out the remaining aromas.  Taste was similar to taht of a good lager. Fresh and crisp with a good malt pallet and light hoppy bite. Not so bad.  Mouth was smooth and lite with a good amount of carbonation.  Being the only steam beer I've had, this isn't that bad. It would probably be better during the summer rather than the winter.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,RocketWidget,4.22,"This one is quite pleasing. Pours a dark copper color, could use a little more head. Despite this, I love this beer. The hops here have a perfect balance to the malt, and this beer has a crisp, refreshing aftertaste. Exceptionally drinkable. Like a pilsner, this would go with nearly any meal, yet it is more hearty and full bodied than that style.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Backer2004,4.55,"One of the best all around domestics around. Glad to see it at a cafe for $2.50 a bottle. Usually one of the more expensive six packs at the local grocery store. After reading the review by Michael Jackson 6 months ago, I knew I needed to try this famed steam beer. Loved it then and my feelings haven't changed now. Cannot compare to another steam beer, but the appreance is above average, nice head and carbonation (but seen better). Balanced taste just perfect. Would love to convert others that stick to their Coors, Bud Light and Miller Light. Try one today.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,moocey,4.43,"God Bless Fritz Maytag.  The commercial beer selection in Auburn, AL is dismal, if not abysmal compared to most anywhere else in America. (I say ""commercial beer"" because Auburn has a brewpub, of all things. And I homebrew.) Anyway, three quality microbrews make it to Auburn, and Anchor is one of them. Anchor steam can be found in just about every grocery store, amidst the pretend real beers such as Redhook and Flying Dog. If I'm out of my own stuff, and I want to have a good beer sitting at home after work - oftentimes it's Anchor Steam because Anchor Brewing and their 50 employess get beer from San Fran all the way to here.  Appearance - Just your average beautiful amber I'd expect from a beer like this. Good, but nothing special.  The smell is overwhemingly malty  As indicated by the smell, Big and malty up front. Is there something lemony/fruity there as well? Great dry grassy hop finish that balances out the malt perfectly. Mouthfeel is full and kinda creamy. This beer can be different from sip to sip. Lately when I have one of these the flavors all seem to run together rather, rather than having a beginning, middle, and end. Definately some lemony esters up front.

Very little lace, but not expected either. Smells of hops, malt, maybe a bit of citrus. A very unique beer in my opinion. Has that lager taste, but also has that IPA taste to it. Even has a bit of citrus taste in the mix. It goes down very smooth. A very easy beer to go through a six pack and still want more. Possibly my favorite session beer, or at least for a nice hot day after working or playing hard. This was the first beer I was introduced to while growing up. I remember swimming in Eagle Lake (Northern California) and doing a little snorkling and finding a bottle cap from an Anchor Steam bottle. I must have smelled it for days. It was such a facsinating smell to me. This was when I was about 7 or 8 years old. Ahhhh, good old memories.

I really love this stuff. Best on Tap at an Old Chicago with a slice of pepperoni pizza.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,tatterdash,4.15,"Interesting style... it sort of combines the clarity and hoppiness of a lager with the head and maltiness of an ale. Pours a clear brown with a big foamy head which looks very good. Smell was nutty and hoppy. Taste was a sort of ""This is a lager?"" taste, nutty, with some roasted malts and a nice hoppy finish.

Appears light applejuice color, very bubbly with a poofy little head that vanishes pretty quickly. I can barely smell this beer... perhaps a little fruity/grapey scent in there though. This beer tastes bitter at first, and has a unique flavor. Tastes and feels like champagne actually. Definately white grape flavor present. The drinkability is brought down a bit by the fact that the beer is so bubbly. All in all this is fairly good beer.

Spying that it was on sale for $6.29 at Albertsons recently (And normally in the $8-$9 range), I thought I would pick up some for the Cardinals-Saints pre-game tailgate. Poured as an amber color with a nice head that lasted awhile. My nose detected a hint of floral hops, otherwise there was nothing notable. Taste was nicely balanced between a hint of caramel with a light dry hop finish. Mouthfeel resulted in a nice clean finish.

Malty, earthy and grassy in the aroma, a slight bit diacetyl and further mineral-like qualities in in the water content. Slightly malty sweet, yet astringent from the malt and backed with a further dulled astringency from the hops. A bit fruity in the whole hop/malt balance, but if you know the brewing history behind a ""Steam"" (trademarked) or California Common beer, you'll understand why this beer had pushed the envelope at one time when it came to small-batch brewing.

It starts out with a hit of hop bitterness that quickly leads into a sweet, biscuity almost honeyish feel. There isnt much of a finish other than lingering bitterness.

This is another offering that reminds me of those candies that has the gooey caramel outside and the white sugary middle.  Solid foamy feel. Crisp even after sitting. Goes back like me gullet is pried open.  An easy summer swiggable brew. Awfully drinkable.  Last swigs: This is an historical brew. A truely American style. Blend of lager and ale.

Thankfully, Anchor Steam is a full-flavored brew that doesn't feel too heavy for high drinkability. Overall, I really liked this beer, but didn't find it to be the most exciting style around. Anchor Steam is a must-try though, it's not often you find the originator of a style of beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Ricochet,4.12,"Tried this a long time ago and it wasn't a taste I wanted to re-visit compared to the awesome Anchor Porter. I was able to mix-and-match a 6 from my local beverage store so I got a couple and I was pleasantly suprised.  Appearence: Dark amber, little head.  Smell: Slight fruity scent but an unusual note like no other beer making this unique.  Mouthfeel: Foamy and rich  Taste: It starts out a little lighter, almost like a champagne. A slight ""Trappist Monk Ale"" note assuming that comes from how this beer is hopped. Strong alchololic taste and strong hoppy flavor with no fruity flavors. Towards the end, just a slight lager flavor.  This Anchor is a very unique and respectable beer. I'll have it again as a change up or sampler but I prefer the porter/liberty ale.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Jacobier10,4.18,"On-tap @ Whiskey's in Boston, MA.  Amber/brown color with a creamy head. Left some nice lacing on thw glass as it went down, and it went down FAST. Very smooth tasting. Very well-balanced hops and malts. Sweet and bitter tasting, yet is not rough on the palate. A truly unique beer that goes down way too easy. A must try!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,ybnorml,3.65,This is a clean amber ale with afizzy white heat that disappears quickly. The beer has a light sweet malty aroma. The malt flavor promised in the aroma gives way to an assertive hop bitterness before giving a crisp clean finish. A tasty drink for when you're having more than one.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Hibernator,4.1,"I had this out of a 12 oz brown bottle served in a pint glass.  The appearance is a nice copper bronze with a thick 1 inch head. Creamy and sticky head. Some lacings, but they didn't sustain like some beers.  The smell is malty and distinctive, classic Anchor.  The taste is sweet and full. Grainy and complete sips. It's hard to compare this beverage to anything else, it's totally original. The carbonation is so nice too, providing a very soft mouthfeel. The soft quality only adds to the drinkability.  All I can say is that this is one quality beer. A standard in the craft beer market and always welcomed by me when I see it on tap at a bar. It might be a tad overpriced for a 6 pack. I think a 6 pack goes for around $8.39 or usually higher, but this is a solid product and a true session beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,kbub6f,4.08,"The beer is clear, dark amber with a big, yellow-tan, foamy, active head that collapses crustily. It leaves soap-film runny lacing. Fruit and crackers in the nose. A fruity, bitter front. A light, fruity middle showing some caramel. A nutty, fresh, bitter finish. A little tea. Hoppy aftertaste. This is a nice, fresh, hoppy, light beer. A good dinner beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,oxmasterscream,3.63,"Pours a dark amber with a 2 finger, thick head which stuck around for quite a while. I recognized immediate sweet malt smells with just a touch of hops. The taste is nice and balanced - malty, even nutty maybe followed by a bit of bitterness from the hops; it's a smooth, easy drinking beer. It seems to be a little overly carbonated and maybe that adds an interesting, individual characteristic to it; I'm not sure. At times, I felt like I couldn't find my way through the bubbles to get a good grip on some other lesser tastes though. It's still very drinkable, tastes pretty good and obviously, very popular as a result.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,BeerResearcher,3.16,12 oz brown bottle. No date. It pours a pale gold/copper color with a pure white fizzy head. A light malt aroma rises up then fades quickly. A faint smell of floral hops is noticed. A light biscuity malt flavor is somewhat lost in the seltzery effervescence. The light metallic hop bite is also diminished within the Champagne-like spritziness. It's well made but too un-beer-like. Much different and better on draught!,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,misterscooter,4.14,"This beer is a classic. I don't run across it all too often even though it is a local beer but it represents the area well. I came across it again tonight at a reception and when it is available, I always have at least one. Strangely, I usually don't want more than one but it is easy to twist my arm.  Out of the bottle, it has a small, albeit sharp bite. Fairly dry but smooth in your mouth, easy to swallow. The aftertaste lingers but doesn't bother you and seems to invite you to take another pull. I don't recall any specific flavors coming out, which makes me think it is benign but I know there is a lot to it. Perhaps it is the maltiness slightly surrounding the other nuances in it. It is a beer worth taking the time to savor. I should have done that more tonight.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,tjd25,3.62,"The head is dense and regular and faded quickly; the body is of a red amber color. The smell is very malty and reminded me mostly of sweet watery caramel. Almost porto like. A bit yeasty, showing also a fruity character, maybe sweet strawberries. Also a chestnut aspect and a very dry floral note of straw. Interesting. The taste shows caramel but mostly a sweet winy/porto-like fruitiness, oaked and viscuous. Some sweet citrus too. A thick and dry hoppiness reveals a mint and chocolate character. The mouthfeel is quite pronounced, but maybe the accent on the hops is a bit over the top. Maybe a bit too thick to be highly drinkable.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,jayb,3.78,"Poured out a nice orangish reddish color with a puffy off-white head. head was chunky in parts and left a fair amount of lacing on the glass. i didnt get much of a smell from this beer, a slight flowery scent with a bit of bitterness maybe. Taste was well balanced. A nice bitter hop bite at the beginning, but got sweeter as it warmed up. finished dry and tasty. A nice brew that is very smooth drinking. this would be a nice beer to have any time of the day. clean, refreshing, and different. Jay enjoyed this one.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,malthead,3.28,"Good appearance, dark amber color and big head. No single, overwhelming smell... mostly just clean, dry, a little malt, maybe a little hops. Taste is rather nondescript as well, maybe just a little grain, except for a strange, slightly bitter aftertaste. I like a good bitter, but this is either too bitter or not bitter enough, it just doesn't seem to work for me. However, this is my first of the style, so take that into consideration. Good drinkability, it goes down smoothly, but I just can't say I'd want to buy another one.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,beerinator,3.92,"Appearance: Reddish Brown. Very clear beer. The head is diminishing and off-white, but there is nice lacing on the glass after each sip.  Aroma: Sweet malt. The smells a slightly bready. There are hints of brown sugar sweetness in the nose.  Taste: Sweet caramel builds to a dry finish. Their is a bit a fruit in the flavors, maybe raisin. The dark sugary flavors from the caramel and the malt help with the mouthfeel.  Notes: This is a solid beer. It doesn't have bold flavors, and it's not high in alcohol so it would be a good style to consume a few of. The mouthfeel is nice and the beer is pleasant to drink.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,necoadam,3.53,"On-tap at Eli Cannon's  Color was copper with a nice amount of carbonation. Smell was quite clean but some of the malts really showed up in the aromas. They were a little bit more rich than the bottle verison. Taste was a little bit of a let down. It focused more on the earthy tones than anything. I was expecting more of a hop/malt combination just like the bottle verison, but it was mostly earth tones. Not bad by any means, but I would of liked to see some more flavors in there.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,flaminghomer,3.65,"i've been waiting to have this beer for a long time. it has a sweetness to it that usually goes along with high abv ales, but this one is under 5%. so i cant figure that out. a little too malty and sweet for me to love it, though i can surely taste that is made of quality beer goodness :) it has a good amount of hops but the malts over power them. the color and appearance are very pleasing.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,connecticutpoet,3.95,"This beer was a nice amber color, slightly cloudy, with a low head when I poured it. A good looking brew.  The aroma was of slightly sweet malt, some woodiness, and some depth of hoppiness.  The taste did not disappoint. It was nicely bitter, which lasted long into the aftertaste. It also was smooth and rich. A little thin to the taste, though, so the mouthfeel was a little less than what I expected.  Still, a good beer and one to add to your tasting list when you can find it.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,surfmeister,4.2,"Slightly hazy copper color with firm, fluffy head which later broke into chunks and stuck to the glass, nice lacing. Malty smell, with earthy slightly nutty, uniquely woody undertones. Taste was very much like an amber lager with a hint of fruitiness, consistent with the beers' hybrid nature, very flavorful and complex. Hops were firm but in no way overbearing, nicely balanced. Very easy to drink many of these fine beers.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,donnebaby,3.63,"Poured a clean bronze gold color, and pretty much still in the glass, with a small head that fell to a thinner ring of cream and haze. Smell is light malts, flavorful but not too wild.  Taste was also flavorful caramel malts, with fruity apple notes. Clean finish, scant hops. The mouthfeel was the highlight for me, crisp yet firm soft bubbles.  This beer seemed highly drinkable to me, and great with the chicken gumbo I was eating.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,niknar,4.03,"Pours out a light copper with an off-white head. It built a good head readily, and eventually settled to about a 1/4 inch thick... still hasn't totally disappeared. Smells somewhat of sweet malt and fruity esters. Better smell than most beers I've reviewed so far. Tastes great! Immediate bitterness, balanced by smooth malt and fruity flavors. Finishes dry with a lingering bitterness...not too much, but enough to let you remember you've had a great beer. Mouthfeel also very good. Just enough carbonation to keep it light, but still feels substantial enough for my dark beer tastes. This is definitely a beer I can drink over and over again... a wonderful offering!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,JackTheRipper,4.47,"Let me preface this review by saying that this is the first time I've tried this style, so my review may reflect a more subjective thought process. A: Pours a nice amber color. Head was initially a big fluffy two inch deal. (I'm drinking it out of my fave beer glass, a Stella Artois glass I got at a bar). Head dissipated quickly, no lacing seen. S: Heavy malty sweet aroma with some caramel hints. No hop aromas. Smell is quite unique and very pleasing. T: Nice roasty malt taste right up front. There's something happening here, what it is ain't exactly clear... This beer has a malty flavor I can recognize, but there's something else going on I don't know how to describe other than saying that it's damned tasty. Finish is a sharp sort of twang that doesn't last, there's virtually no aftertaste here. M: Slick carbonation, medium bodied, with a nicely low ETOH level compared to some of the beers I've been drinking. Two of these won't have you giving your keys to a friend. D&N: This a beer unlike any other. The taste is familiar, but with something extra that really makes this beer shine. I haven't finished a beer this quickly in a long time, but it's just so tasty that I ""reviewed"" it in about twenty minutes. Highly recommended.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,pheurton,3.76,"earthy brown color of tree bark, with a tight foamy head that is just off-white and hangs around in the form of an ever-present collar. weak aroma of nutty grain and lemony hops. not much there. light to medium body builty on a foundation of steady CO2 bubbles. surprising sharp and earthy flavor that is completely new to me. this beer has a character all of its own, i keep thinking earthy in my mind, but not in a hoppy sense. this flavor dominates, which is followed by a salty/lemony hop bite that is actually quite assertive for a lager. easy to put away a few, once you become friends with the flavors going on here.  on of the boldest lager beers i can think of, unique and full of character. i don't know if i'd always reach for this first, but i think it will always stick out in my mind. another winning original.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,TheOtherMike,4.1,"I do like this beer - but I only get it when I cannot get their Liberty Ale. So I usually find myself drinking it while wishing I had a Liberty, which tends to lessen my opinion of this beer. I should really appreciate what it has to offer:  Nice rich color with a moderate head, a complex taste that says ""this is beer, and good beer too"".

28,63,Hunter,3.66,"I've always liked the distinctive pot-bellied bottle, label, and blue cap.  Beer pours a nice tan head with good retention. Beer itself is a deep copperry color. Thin traces of carbonation throughout.  Sweet malt, light hops in the nose. As the beer warms it seems to go through a brief phase if unpleasantness before settling into a much nicer hop/spice note.  Hops are more prevalent in the taste but not by much; malt still dominates here. Finishes nicely. And yes, you'll have another.  This is a good one for those new to the microbrew scene to cut their teeth on.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,DPMomutant,4.2,"Pours with a medium-sized creamy head. Pretty good retention there. Some lacing here. The body is a very nice copper color.  The smell is pretty simple to my nose. It's a nice, medium-toasty malty smell. I'm having a tought time getting anything else from it but I like it just the same.  The taste at the beginning is actually a tiny bit sweet. In the middle the malt comes out and I catch some wheat in there too. The end brings some balancing bitterness. A very unique taste, indeed.  The mouthfeel is fairly thick in the body, thicker than you might expect from looking at it. The carbonation is lively but balanced. Smooth finish.  This is easily a good beer for sessions, whether hanging around outside or inside watching the game.  Overall this is a very solid beer and the availability is a very good thing if you're stuck somewhere you can't get much else.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,meathookjones,3.57,"Had on tap at the Cactus in Newport News, VA. Came to me in a glass with a nice amber color, but not much head in sight due to its pouring is my guess. A nice clean aroma with malt sweetness and notes of citrus detectable. A light toasted malt flavor is accompanied by a sweet taste and a slight bitterness. Definatly a lot of lager charecteristics to this beer. A little too thin in the mouthfeel and a very smooth drink. It has a slightly unusal flavor the is complex enough to keep you interested and makes for a good summer brew.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,slitherySOB,3.93,"Hmm, good beer in the Congo. Anchor Steam poured an amber colour, with a big three finger head. After a few minutes, the head went away, just leaving a small amount of foam. Lacing coats the glass like a curtain. Very pleasant. Sweet smell of malt(vienna?), banana, citrus, hop, and more malt. Sweet tasting, with enough of a bite to be satisfying. Little overcarbonated mouthfeel, but that's forgivable. Highly drinkable. A good session beer, and my first beer of this style.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,HiroProtagonist,3.85,"Anchor Steam Beer was served from a 12 oz. bottle. In a pint glass, the beer was a clear and vibrant orange amber and was topped by an ample white head that left thick sheets of lacing. The nose was crisp yet bready sweet with notes of banana, complemented by a nice resiny/citrus hop bouquet. The taste opened with smooth bready-citrus malts, followed by a spicy-zippy grapefruity bitter transition to a citrus zesty banana-tinged spicy, moderately bittered finish. The body was a little too thin for the flavors and character of the beer, but otherwise was appropriate. Anchor steam was a satisfying and tasty beer, with some uniqueness to add to the interest.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,marcellaproust,2.83,"Pours a nice, fluffly head that eventually dissipates into an assertive cloud cover. Amber colored. Smells like basic beer: that Budweiser, Miller, Pabst scent. Starts with a malty (no roast) blank creaminess and ends with plenty of hops.

28,63,jsolack,4.33,"Appearance: Slightly hazey copper color... nice fluffy off white head that sticks around while you drink the beer. Overall very nice.  Smell: Carmel and grains with light floral accents. Citrus is in there as well. It's a pretty complex smell. Very intriguing.  Taste: Very interesting flavor. Slightly bitter and sharp initially but once it leaves the tounge it becomes sweeter and milder. Tasty finish, mildly bitter. Very complex and very good.  Mouthfeel: Great mouthfeel... coats tounge well and carbonation level is about perfect. Fits the flavor of the beer perfectly.  Drinkability: This is a great beer. It's unusual flavor sets it apart from other beer. Very easy to drink... Overall it's great.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Taste: Very bitter in an unpleasant way. Tastes like it is way past it's prime. I did not like the taste of this beer. Maybe it was from and old keg, but I don't think this is likely based on previous reviews. Mouthfeel: Pretty standard mouthfeel. Right amount of carbonation. Drinkabilty: No thanks. This is worth sampling, but the old bitterness make it bad in my book.

28,63,FormatKid,3.88,"I picked this beer up as part of a mixed-single arrangement from Riverside Beverage in Chattanooga. Ive been wanting to try it a long time but the six-pack price in my area is intimidating if its something Im not sure whether Ill like it or not.  It pours out a slightly dark shade of translucent amber-orange. A meager head appears less than a fingers breadth after the pour. Small carbonation bubbles abound.  The smell is slightly fruity, and that dense sweet lagerish presence is there. A background smell of alcohol is present as well.  The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy yet slick and quaffable, which is the first thing I notice. The flavors interweave across my tongue. The malt flavor leads off, sweet and tangily bready. Sweet fruits flirt with my tastebuds as well, ripe plums, etc. A dry after taste is left and my mouth waters for more.  This beer is unique and it has a beautiful character. I definitely enjoy this brew a lot, the price is pretty steep in my area though. I will definitely have to have a craving for this beer in particular to shell out the $11 for a six pack when compared to many other brews that I enjoy as much. I definitely owe a lot of respect to the history of this beer for helping to kick off the craft beer movement in the U.S. I will definitely drink again.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Hagbard,3.46,"Pours golden with a 3/4"" light tan head, which fades fairly quickly but leaves a nice lacing on the side of the glass. Not much of an aroma at all, but what is there smells ""like beer""...slightly hoppy and slightly malty. It smells like what you remember beer smelling like as a child. As the beer hits your tongue, there is a slight hop bitterness. As you begin the swallow, the bitterness changes to a malt presence that is not sweet. The bitterness reappears for the aftertaste. This is a rather strange blend. It is not my favorit beer, but it is very satisfying in warm weather and also when served with just about any meal. It is very drinkable.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Crotor,4.12,"This beer is a legend for a reason. Truly unique, Anchor Steam Beer monopolizes the California common beer style.  Crystal clear, rich amber, with a moderate head, Anchor Steam presents a fist class appearance.  The drinker is met by a big aroma of toasty (*toasty,* not sweet) malt. This toasty malt character is also very substantial in the taste. This beer screams malt. Delightful, toasty, dry malt. No sweetness needed here. The moderate hopping is in perfect balance. The highly aggressive ale-like taste profile diffeers slightly from that of an ale because of the lager yeast. This manifest somewhat in a slight tartness and the ""shape"" of the taste.  Anchor Steam is fully deserving of its reverence.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,LuckySevens82,3.86,"12 oz bottle. I must admit, this is not the first time I've tried this beer. The first taste I had was when I first started getting into better beer, I personally didn't like it at all whatsoever. It had a very strange aftertaste. This time is different. Poured a nice deep honey color with a small thick white head. Smells of grains and slight caramel notes. There is some hops in the nose, but nothing overpowering. Taste is sweet, caramel, but not overwhelming. The graininess and hops balanace out this brew nicely. This brew is bitter, but not at all overwhelming. The malt character is astounding and I could not ask for a better balance between the two. This is like no other beer I have tried. An excelent brew.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,AllThingsNinja,4.15,"Poured into a tumbler, this honey amber brew grew a bubbly white head. The grain aroma, with it's subtle yeast accent, was inviting. The rolling malt flavors started grainy but became sweet and syrupy, only to lead to a crisp finish. The hop spicing provides some interesting counter point, and makes the brew an excellent pair with a bowl of chilli. The mouth feel is fair, at times a little too syrupy, but otherwise this is a drinkable beer that will likely return to my fridge.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,WetCoaster,3.88,"Appearance: A nice honey amber with an excellent rocky white head; nice retention to boot. Some lacing, and active, but short-lived carbonation.  Smell: Sweet syrupy malt comes through, with apple yeast and a bit of hop spice.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Uniquely steam. Very malty body with a strong, bready yeast flavor on top. Hops blend to create a somewhat perfumed fruitcake taste--you'll know it's Anchor Steam. Anchor's mouthfeel is, not surprisingly, a bit syrupy and creamy, though medium bodied. The finish is slightly bitter and drying. The carbonation is big and rough, but it settles quickly.  Drinkability: It's a good beer, but I'd prefer something a bit more focused and crisp. Still, it's easy to drink and quite tasty.  This is an American classic. The somewhat unusual, non-genre specific flavor might not appeal to all, but it's a well-made, enjoyable brew.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,palma,4.22,"Light amber body with a creamy long lasting tan head. Aroma is sweet malt, brown sugar, and floral with an enticing hoppiness. Taste is caramel malt and some spiced hops.

Ruby red, with nice carbonation, and a decent head. The lacing was thick, and hung around 'til the very end.  Smells hoppy, but tastes malty. Very smooth, with what seems like a couple different malty flavors very nicely blended together.  Very smooth and a little creamy.

28,63,MobBarley,4.8,"This is a staple in Northern California, and a beer I can remember people drinking around me since my early years. Pours a gorgeous copper/amber color with an average, fizzy off-white head and some solid, sticky lacing. The aroma is strong and sweet with some green hops tang underneath and a note that reminds me of banana...though this is not nearly as bizarre as it sounds, and in fact imparts yet another distinctive aspect to an already unique brew. The taste is likewise singular. I get a big maltiness in the beginning that is masterfully balanced with a healthy dose of grassy hops that keeps the brew on the bitter side. The finish is citrusy and slightly minerally, with a hint of the same exotic banana note that is hinted at in the nose. The mouthfeel is good and chewy but refreshing as well. Drinkability is practically unparalleled. This is a must try and a true American icon of a brew.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,yeagerbm,3.83,"Pours with small white head and amber/bronze body. Very nice color. Slight malt and hop in smell. Flavor is satisfying with some slightly roasted malt and smooth but crisp, sharp hop bitterness, and lingering bitter aftertaste. Average mouthfeel for a non-macro, not thick.

28,63,RasputinsRevenge,4.33,"I had forgotten how much I liked this beer before I picked some up at the store this weekend. Appearance was a shade of copper, with a respectable head. The aroma has a pleasant fruity smell to it, along with a slightly burnt malty smell. The taste, mouthfeel and drinkability, are good to very good. This is by no means a ""heavy"" beer nor a ""light"" beer, to me, it has an almost perfect balance that makes it not only tastey, but very drinkable - something that I think is not easily achievable in the brewing world. This is one of the breweries and beers that revitalized the craft-brewing industry in America, and it's still making a statement some 30+ years later.

Great rich initial hit of flavor but it breaks quickly.  I found this bottle true to my distant memory of drinking Anchor Steam some 15 years ago at the brewery in SF. I don't think that they have messed with it or softened it much. (Perhaps as other reviewers have suggested so many more flavor packed brews have hit the streets since these guys blazed a trail).  For me, I'd put this in a 12 pack of classic American beers. It is drinkable and true.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,soper2000,3.28,"While Anchor is a flagship of American brewing this brew does not do much for me but I love Anchor for doing it as it has provided a stepping stone into the craft brewing world. I cut my teeth on this beer so to speak and still revisit it from time to time. The beer pours a light amber color with a clear head. The smell is nothing spectacular but then again, it's not offensive either. Its taste is initially interesting as the hops struggle to let presence be known. As the bottle is finished it leaves you with just an average feeling. This beer is tons better than BMC but again, it does not do much for me. I must salute Anchor for being a pioneer though and this beer definately has its place in my fridge for the occasional BBQ or for my as of yet to be BA friends",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,jimdkc,3.48,"Poured a clear, dark gold color with a white medium-sized head. Very nice looking. Nose was carmel malt with a hint of hops. Taste was more carmel malt at first followed by earthy hops with a touch of subdued grapefruit. I'd say this is more balanced than the Anchor Liberty Ale I reviewed recently. Mouthfeel was OK... pretty high carbonation. High drinkability, goes down easy and nothing offensive about it.  I'd easily choose this over a Bud or Miller, but I don't think I'd seek this out. I do, however, see how this gained popularity back when an American microbrew was a novelty. This would probably be a great gateway beer to lure someone away from macroswill to quality beers!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,GCBrewingCo,4.32,"The beer poured clear golden amber. The head was white and did not hang around long, but laced the glass.  The aroma was woodsy Northern Brewer hops and some slight caramel.  The flavor was bitter NBrewer hops with caramel but no sweetness.  The finish was dry and woodsy bitter into the aftertaste. The body was medium.  12 ounce bottle.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,watermelonman,3.68,"This beer poured with lots of carbonation and a nice white head. It sits in the glass with a dark gold color. It looks crisp and clean. It's tastes good, too. The carbonation makes it feel very light on the tongue, but the flavor is still substantial.  If any beer was ever properly described by the word ""suds"", this is it. It's a great standby to have waiting in the refrigerator.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,AdrenX,3.33,"I spotted a six-pack of this Californian Common while I was grocery shopping at Giant Eagle. I was really surprised to find it and have never seen it sold at my local Giant Eagle before. When grocery shopping I always stop and check to see if they have any new micro beers in stock. And to my surprise they had two six-packs left. I grabbed one and rushed home to crack one open.  This beer pours a very clear average size head, which clings to the glass nicely to form a good lace on the glass. Color is any where from copper to amber. Head retention is average and carbonation seemed just right. Has a clean malty and grainy aroma. An average bitterness with a dry aftertaste that just lingers a little. This beer goes down very easy. Nothing real exciting and nothing really wrong either.  After finishing one I was a slightly disappointed. It may have been due to all the expectation and hype I have heard about this famous beer. One consideration to take from my review is that I live in Cleveland, Ohio so this beer may not have been in the best condition. I will definitely be giving this beer another try. Everyone must try an Anchor Steam beer at least once.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Mark,4.6,"I have had a renewed love affair with Anchor the last month or so. Since returning to my ""roots"" I thought I should re review this classic that is responsible for the micro revolution, it also started me in to the world of quality beer. This beer is a medium amber, head retention and lacing are excellent. Fresh malty and grainy aroma is prominent. Smooth, rounded, refreshing and a tad dry. Some caramel notes, Good hoppy bite. A totally drinkable beer, good year round.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,ngandhi,4.17,"Buttery, caramelly, and honeyed, this is an absolutely gorgeous beer. Anchor Steam centers this hybrid style of beer around the lager instead of the ale and so it comes off as a rich example of an otherwise unenticing style. Malt character is up front with flawless northern brewer bittering that's lightly spicy, but otherwise neutral. One of the most subtle beers I've had, yet it never fails to deliver. This isn't a beer, it's a lesson in etiquette.  Relax, relax. ng",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Zorro,4.1,"Pours a clear beer that is a deep bronze color.  Smell is mostly of hop perfume. There is also malt, grain and toffee smells here.  Taste is of malt balanced by hops, it is a little sweet but then the hops dry the flavor out without being bitter. Mild caramel and citrus are in here. Many ghostly flavors to this, you taste it and then it changes or hides. Succeeds in being flavorful without being harsh in any respect, an excellent brew to convert the Budweiser drinkers of the world.  Mouthfeel is solid.  Super drinkable, mild yet flavorful.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Dubblebock,4.1,"Anchor Steam is one rollickin' good beer, one that I don't get my hands on nearly often enough. This particular bottle came to me by way of fellow Texan and co-worker BA MJBrill, who picked up a bottle of Anchor OSA and the Steam for me on one of his beer runs.  The Steam has a well-deserved reputation as an American beer classic, and it definitely fits the bill. It lives up to it's hype, that's for sure. This was one of my ""gateway"" beers many years ago, one of my initial introductions to the wider world of craft beers.  Anchor Steam pours with an amber hue, lighter looking than one might expect. The head was a good half-inch thick, but it didn't hand around for too long. Still, a nice-looking pour. Good carbonation. Smell was malty and faintly fruity in an nondescript way.  The taste was smooth and easygoing. Slight hops bitterness chased the malts, but the light fruityness kept tingling my tongue. Slightly biscuity, with an earthy feel the whole way down. Very good mouthfeel, the level of carbonation is just about perfect in this beer. Extremely drinkable, it was gone before I knew it, leaving me to wonder why I don't pick this up more often.  If you've never had this classic beer, try one. It's distributed just about everywhere, and it's generally affordable. Anchor Steam has a lot of interesting history behind it, as does the entire Anchor Brewing Company. It's right powerfull stuff, and it's fun to learn the background of this great American beer. I'm glad I had the opportunity to spend some time with this old friend.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,BuckeyeNation,3.65,"Served in a cold bottle with a frigid, ice-crusted beer mug. Once I let both warm for about 10 minutes, I was all set to pour beer into glass. Dark amber with a heavy dose of orange. The head was eggshell white and firm. It had decent staying power and left several thick rings of lace.  The smell was of earthy hops, not a bit floral or citrusy. The flavor was of earthy hops and grain. There was a mild-moderate amount of bitterness without much hop flavor, but it was still pretty good stuff.  The finish was long and bitter and the beer dried out a bit at the very end. The mouthfeel was firm, seamless and smooth. Anchor Steam is a true American classic.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,merlin48,3.81,"Pours a clear, copper amber with a small beige head that retains well, and leaves lots of patchy and sheet lacing. Nose is subdued, but is a nice balance of fruity hops and caramel malt. Mouthfeel is well carbonated with a moderate hops bite. Good, well rounded taste that is dominated by lager style malts. Plenty of fruity and floral hops for balance. A very friendly drinking American classic that is deserving of its reputation in the history of 20th century American brewing. Exceptional drinkability.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,99bottles,3.33,"I had a pint of this last night and I was a little taken aback. I've had this in a bottle before, but I decided to try it on tap (especially after trying the Anchor Steam Xmas brew--excellent!!) This beer pours a medium orange-brown and had a faint musty smell. The taste was different. Certainly not what I remembered. I sort of think I had some pulled from a really old keg, because it just felt flat, and had macro-like thinness. I know this isn't a thick beer, and I noted light citrus notes of orange or something, but again it just felt 'off'. There were very faint hops, and decent malt, but again, not what I wanted. I'll try to re-review with a well kept bottle, but as it stands, I would not order this on tap again (at least not where I got it last time)",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,GeoffRizzo,3.1,"Clear amber hue, thin bubbly white head. Weak aroma of hops, malts, barely noticeable. Creamy, sweet, sweet malts off the bat, backed by somewhat of a light grainy touch. Hops dominated palate; medium bodied. Dry finish, little aftertaste going on here. Perhaps a yeasty end, again hops-dominated palate. Not as good as I remember, somewhat subdued flavorings, nothing to really get your attention. Average across the board.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,waughbrew,3.06,"A very clear light copper with a whitish head with impressive creaminess and retention. A bright sting of hops, but surprisingly not cascades in this californian brew. It smells like a German variety along with bready buttery malt. Flavor is a nice fight between the hops and caramel malt - the hop flavor and bitterness rides all the way through, although I find the finish is slightly harsh. The body is too heavy to be a session brew of mine, and the tingly carbonation is not that great. Despite the rich history, I find this brew to be pretty forgetable. Good hop flavors accompany a decent caramel malt body with a subpar feel. An average beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Beastdog75,3.55,"Anchor Brewing is another company that can be considered one of the ""pioneers"" of the microbrew revolution. Who knows where American beer might be if Fritz Maytag stuck to selling household appliances instead of beer. Anchor Steam Beer is a unique beer that is just a bit funkier than your average run-of-the-mill American macro.  This beer pours a nice copper/amber color with a decent off-white foam that lasts for about 30 seconds. A very fruity aroma emminates from this beer with a light hoppiness detectable underneath that. The mouthfeel is a little thin, and there is a low-moderate amount of carbonation in this brew. The fruity flavors seem to be the focus here, and a bubblegum like flavor seems to partner up with the fruitiness. There are some hints of caramel malt with an even lighter hint of buttery toffee. Some soapy flavors make their presence felt as well, with a low-moderate hop bitterness popping up in the finish with a grapefruit like quality. The aftertaste has some flavors of toasty grains, and is more dry then I was expecting. The beer finishes off with very little alcoholic warmth.  This is a very easy to drink beer, and even though it isn't the most complex brew in the world it is certainly an interesting one. I wouldn't mind having this with some ""finger foods"" such as mozzarella sticks, potato skins, buffalo wings, etc. Fritz did the beer drinking world a service by saving the Anchor Brewery, and I'll salute him by drinking a few of these anyday.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,JamesBerry,3.46,"Deep amber color, with a great head. Smells simultaneously fruity, tangy and malty. This possesses a bitter taste, though deep and malty, and with an aftertaste that is even more bitter. Not surprisingly, this was rather complex, and an impressive example of a truly unique style.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,wsouloa,3.06,Not a bad beer and perhaps my rating is a bit lower than it would have been if I hadn't heard so many good things about this beer. I tried this beer for the first time in Northern California. It pours a very nice orangish-red type of color. The smell isn't very overpowering. The taste initially is very good but then it gives a bit of a dry aftertaste to which I wasn't a fan of. Its a better beer than most of the things you will find in most local bars. I would try this again but not anywhere where they have a good selection of beers.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,filabrazilia,3.6,"Pours a clear copper delight with a nice off-white head. Exceptional lace adorns the glass.  There is a light hop essence in the nose with a hint of sweet malt.  There was not as much flavor as I expected there would be. There is a slight malt sweetness in the taste. I wanted more flavor from this beer.  There was a smooth and creamy presence in the mouth as I drank this beer. A nice hop bite on the back of the tongue finishes the beer.  Despite the absence of flavor, this is a drinkable beer. All other elements of the beer brought up its rating. I would try this again.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,CBFanWish,3.83,A copper colour with a thick head that had real staying power and ended in a pretty lace. The smell was sweet and malty. The taste had a bready quality to it. Also sweet.

28,63,JAL67,3.63,"A very good beer...a classic. I started having this beer(actually my first micro ever) to get away from the macros. Solid, solid beer. Has a nice red/copper color and good hops. Very good taste and a beer to enjoy.  A very complex beer but at the same time I can recommend to those just starting out on the journey of ""good"" beer that this is a beer not to be missed.  I don't have it as often but every once in awhile I go back to it. I would say it's along the lines of my fav brewer...Sam Adams.

28,63,byrd,4.18,"Good sized frothy and rocky white head. Clear copper in color. The head is quite sticky and reduces very slowly, holding onto the sides of the glass until it eventually becomes a thin lace. Mild aroma that is a bit different (cant quite put my finger on it) yet hops are fairly apparent. Nice smooth medium mouthfeel. Bready malt start with a caramel notes. Nice hop finish that is a bit dry and lasts a good length of time. Some slight lemon notes are noticeable. Great highly drinkable, well balanced brew. I really liked this one.

28,63,Shaw,3.97,"Enjoyed a pint of this at my local pub, the Cock & Bull. I've had Anchor Steam many times before, but never reviewed it until now.  It is a pale bronze color with a short head that vanishes after a few sips. It smells lightly of hops and a teeny bit of malt. There is a good amount of hops in Anchor Steam, both for bitterness and aroma. It had a solid body, neither too light nor too heavy.  Anchor Steam is a good beer, especially for those who enjoy hops.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,WesWes,4.2,"The beer pours a reddish gold color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is good. It is of sweet malts and a mild hops; very aromatic. The taste is good. It is dry and malty.

28,63,mschofield,4.07,"Coppery amber with a two finger head, that quickly dwindled to a bubbling head, while it lasted the head was quite pillowy. Well carbonated. Malty sweet and lightly hopped (earthy) aroma. Malt taste (caramel and toasted grain), but a little too coppery (metallic), earthy hops, slight citrus as well. Light-medium feel with good carbonation feel, an easy drinking session beer. Thank you Mr. Maytag",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Mouthfeel- crisp with a faint bitterness. Goes down too easy!  Overall, quite frankly 1 of the best beers ever!!! A beer that yo can slowly savor or drink several of hanging out. A beer that you can always rely on!!!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,shirfan,3.8,"Malty, earthy aromas mingled with mild floral hops waft from this light amber / honey colored beer. Head is minimal.  Taste is no surprise after reading about the brewing process. Mild ale flavors made more crisp and subtle by the lager yeast. Caramel malt leads the way, followed by a dry, zingy, carbonated mouthfeel. Refreshing almost in the same way as cola, with a slightly floral hop finish.  Very friendly on the taste buds; high on the drinkability scale. The amount of flavor is ""just right"" for a session brew: solid quality, but I could go through several of these without thinking about them.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,CRJMellor,3.9,Pours deep amber color with a white and highly fomaed head. Aroma is fairly heavily hopped with whiffs of caramel malt in the background head. Taste is sticky caramel followed by a rush of medium hop bitterness. For some reason this beer is much better wih food for me. It seems to compliment so many beers and only conclusion I have is that s some very complex tastes that just aren't picked up until you add food to the mix.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Sammy,3.82,"Best steam beer period. Amber color with white creamy oam head. Toasty salty malt, and above average hops and carbonation which makes it drinkable and popular.

28,63,daledeee,3.9,Pours bright orange-yellow. Head is medium and goes away to lace pretty quickly. Smell is malty and carmelly. Pretty nice carbonation in the taste.

Overall not a bad beer.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,granger10,3.93,"This one poured a clear copper with a good sized light tan head. The smell was more floral than anything but a little on the weak side. The taste was odd in the fact that the hops came first then the malts. Very crisp and lemony in initial taste. Floral hops come through later. A bready, woody malt flavor follows up the hop taste and holds on through the finish. Not much steam or smoke flavor really but there was something slightly different about the body of this beer. Whatever it is this is a very easy one to drink all night long.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,Foxman,3.83,"It pours a light amber, for want of a better hue, and the head starts rather thick, and settles out to islets of thin froth after the first sip. Slivers of white trace the sides of the glass as it empties.  There's little poignant aroma, short of a fleeting whiff of hops.  First hit brings a bitterness, certainly hops, almost a surprise after the slight aroma, followed by a smidgeon of malt. It finishes on the bitter side as well.  It's light bodied, not surprising considering the beer's other characteristics, and quite smooth.  This beer's very drinkable, begging another, maybe two, or during the warmer months, enough to not care how many you've had.  A strong offering. What really grabs me about this beer is the unique style it represents, something uniquely American, a status quite difficult to attain in the beer world.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,ALEBOY,4.14,I had been reading about this beer for years and I finally got to try it. A good session beer I hope its not the last time I try it.

Very easy drinking .,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,AbePhroman,3.2,"The smell of this brewwasquite malty. It poured into a light amber color into my glass. Very malty flavor as well, also bitter for a beer of this type.

Not as watery as expected, and rather drinkable.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,silks636,3.98,"Poured from a 12 oz. brown bottle. No freshness date indicated.  Light golden amber in color. A touch of haze with a medium white head. Decent retention, little lacing. A few quick swirls reveal a light earthy aroma with hints of bread and caramel. Taste begins with a quick flash of sweetness but that is quickly overcome by a salty citric flavor. Definitely hits you, but is not at all unpleasant. Finishes up with a nice toasted malt that ends with a crisp bitterness. Carbonation is vigorous and mouthfeel is light and clean. Very easy drinking and an excellent thirst quencher on a warm evening.  This was one of my first introductions to good beer and has always been a fall back brew for me. Just had to review it as it is simply a classic.

28,63,GeoffFromSJ,2.88,"Taste is subjective and all that, and this beer didn't do too much for me. It starts off well with a nice head which quickly goes down to a lace. It has a nice amber color. The smell is nothing special, but not bad. Same for the taste. As others have mentioned, it has a bite and has a nice hop finish. The hops finish isn't really balanced against any other flavor so the finish ends up distracting from the final taste. It seems to have not much of a taste until the aftertaste. I'm not unhappy with this beer, but it doesn't satisfy me either. This is the only beer I've tried within the ""steam"" style.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Head shrinks to a layer of bubbles at the surface within a minute. Some kickass lacing as this beer was quaffed.  Smell: Great balance of a trio of aroma profiles: Citrusy/floral hops (faint grapefruit), bitter hops (sprucy), and the pale malt. No one smell dominated the other.  Taste: Restrained bitter hops and sweet pale malts. Great balance between the two. Kinda salty. It's like and IPA and a lager at the same time.  Mouthfeel: Very creamy in mouthfeel, more than you would expect given the color. Quite smooth, to boot.  Drinkability: A session beer that could satisfy a hophead, a maltoid, and a new convert to good beer. It has something for the first two to like, and won't scare the newbie.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,DrunkMcDermott,3.78,"The 22 oz. bottle pours a big foamy head atop an amber body. First sips are sweet without being cloying. A slight impression of pear nectar. A bitter hop taste in the back of the mouth mars an otherwise clean finish (or enhances it, as your preference may be). Midway through, I get a more hearty or ""rough"" hoppy smell and taste, ending with a more malty profile as it warms.

Bready notes with caramel hints that finish softly on the palate. Fully flavored, medium bodied. Semi-creamy, nutty character in the mouthfeel. Malty and clean. Slight lemony flavors and a subtle orange peel hop finish to compliment. The hops give the utmost, pleasantly dry finish. This beer has style.  What a beautiful thing.

The texture is fine with a round medium bodied feel. The taste is pleasantly malty, and almost a tad sweet. A little fruitiness can be found as well. A nice tuesday night beer that happens to work better as a food beer than a sipper to me. I served this with halibut in parchment paper using lots of vegetables an Asian flavors.

The aroma is a little hoppy, but the wheat is very prevalent in the nose. Nice aroma. The flavor is a littly malty, a little hoppy, and a little sweet. Great blend of tastes. It is very easy to drink and I think it is a great Summer beer. I've had this several times again and it hasn't disappointed.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,SheepNutz,3.85,"12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a dark copper color with two fingers of head that stay along for the ride. There is some lacing left on the glass. The smell is grassy, piney, and malty. A very nice aroma that fills the nostrils. The taste starts out with a light bit of sweet malt and caramel. The taste ends grassy and a little hoppy. A very well balanced beer. The mouthfeel is just a little light, not too bad. The drinkability is very nice, as this isn't even 5% abv. Too bad others don't make this style.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,oberon,3.88,"I have never tried this on tap and its been awhile since I have had this period so I figured to give it a try yesterday and review it again this time on tap.Pours a deep copper color with light to medium head,a lighter aroma is sweet with a lingering hop presence.The taste is nice and balanced of sweet caramel malt and a dry fruity finish,a very sold American beer a real cant miss selection in my mind.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Webby64,4.03,"Poured a copper, amber color with a slight haze and a good head which stuck around fer awhile. Smell was malty and touch of carmel, very nice. Taste was complex, lil bit of bite (hops) but malt and other well established but simple tastes are present. It is obvious that this beer has been around awhile. I am not too wordy today. I will say, this is very fine beer and I will definately get it again!  M",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,RoyalT,3.58,"Appearance  Nice copper color with a full, lingering head that laces the glass quite nicely.  Smell  Very pleasant, light aroma of hops, fruits, and even some grain.  Taste  Interesting mix of malts and hops. Theres a touch of sweetness in there as well, especially at the finish. Theres also a sour shadow in the flavor that I cant quite pick out that I find distracting. It tastes almost like I tossed a lemon in the glass, but I didnt.  Mouthfeel  This beer has a great mouthfeel. Its rightly carbonated, thirst-quenching, saliva-activating, and goes down smooth.  Drinkability  This one goes down fine and stands out from the rest of the crowd. It is my wifes favorite beer to drink, especially in the summer months.  Comments  The sour twang keeps this one off of my, favorites, list, but its interesting and unique.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,marburg,3.91,"An exceedingly simple yet obviously refined brew. As with many Euro brews, you can taste the 100+ years of history and dedication that went into this beer.  Fairly clear orange-copper tone with an eggwhite head, tightly pulled together and with excellent retention. A solid ring with a nice film remains even after a lengthy meal spent slowing enjoying it. Aroma is faint and pleasantly simple. Distinctly natural, even herbal. Grainy flavor with a lively, massaging mouthfeel. Just a good, solid beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,JMH_,4.41,"i hadn't had an anchor steam in quite some time and thus had forgotten what a great beer this is. pours a simply awesome ruby colour with a just-right head, and a just-right carbonation balance. everything is simply wonderful about the look of this brew. smells of malt and i detected a bit of caramel as well, which can be tasted as well, along with a bunch of other flavours, including spice, citrus, and some saltiness perhaps. this is a slightly creamy brew that is just incredibly easy to drink. i highly recommend it, and it is usually pretty easy to find.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

28,63,WanderingFool,3.8,"The beer is a nice clear amber color with a thin white head that fades quickly to a ring around the surface. An aroma of toasted malts, yeast and flowers (hops?) floats above the beer. Each sip of this thin bodied beer is full of flavor. Toasted malts hold the taste together, but a mild hop bitterness and some spicy flavors add character to this delicious brew. A mild bitterness is left behind when swallowed.  This beer is well balanced and may be a good cross over brew for those who are prone to drink weak flavored beverages.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Phyl21ca,3.51,Extremely nice clear reddish/amber colour with a white head that disapear not too quickly. I can smell some spice. Taste is bitter with some roastiness. I was little bit surprise considering the colour of the beer but I enjoyed it very much. I can't wait to try other Anchor products!,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,TerryW,2.95,"Clear amber colour. Showed a pale ivory head that very quickly disappeared. No lacing to speak of. Smell is mildly hoppy and sweetish. Thin, almost watery mouthfeel. Bitter, hoppy finish. Taste of hops stays with your mouth.  Passable, but unremarkable to my mind.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Skywave,3.2,"It either does not travel well (from SFO to Tulsa) or is overrated. It has a typical copper-amber color as most pale ales do and a slight head, as you'd find on an American lager. it is a fairly balanced brew but none of the malt or hop characteristics stand out. it finishes with a lingering bitterness that is expected. I'm wondering if the problem was with me, I'd had this beer before (in the bottle) several years ago in San Francisco and liked it ok, but this was a let-down. I'll try it again on-tap when I know my palate is not compromised.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,IronDjinn,3.83,"Poured from a 355ml brown bottle with freshness date on back label. Opened it with a brass anchor bottle opener. I like the look of these bottles, and that's definitely one of my favorite logos of all time. Colour is a beautiful light amber, big foamy white head that subsides to a thin layer, some lacing as well. Nose contains caramel toasted malt, some sweet butteryness, some citrus, and rounded by floral hops. Smooth buttery toasted malt flavour, well rounded hop finish. Feels very creamy in the mouth. This is one very smooth beer, like a velvet glove encased in glass.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Garin,3.63,"It poured a very clear hazelnut brown colour. A nice puffy white head formed and shrunk down, leaving a lumpy lacing.  The aroma is very light, and oddly coppery. There is a little bit of toastiness, and perhaps I can imagine woodiness.  The flavour is an interesting balance of some light malt, and some lightly resinous hops. It has a nice lingering hoppy aftertaste. As I get through this one, I find more sweetness and up-front woody flavours. It's definitely a unique beer.  Though the body is nice and full, the carbonation is somewhat lacking. Anyhow, it's a very respectable beer. I like it.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,euskera,4,One of my all-time favorite beers. A class of its own. Love it in the bottle with that crisp spicy taste; love it on tap where it's a little mellower. It has that briny taste that makes me think of San Francisco. Simply one of the most unique beers on the planet and a delight to drink...,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,RenoZymurgist,3.38,Medium white head atop an amber beer with streams of carbonation cascading upwards. Aroma is a bit estery with enough hops and malt to balance the flavors. Sweet taste is complimented by a good amount of hops and the esters make one think of a style that is not quite an ale. Very smooth for an ale(?) with a good balance of flavors. Mouthfeel is of medium weight but not so much as to take away from the clenliness. Very good beer that i would enjoy on a hot day fishing a stream in the mountains.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,usualpulp,3.85,"Pours a nice copper color with a rich white head, lots of carbonation. Slight fruit and nut smell , with a slight hint of malt and alot of hoppiness. The flavor of the beer is great, very nice balance between malt and hop with a slight bitterness to the finish. Small amounts of citris seem present here, along with some nut flavors, possibly almond. Overall this is a very good beer, nice character, and very smooth to drink. Not sure if it is worth the price I had to pay for a 6pk of it, but still good either way.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,beerluvr,3.73,"Pours with an ivory colored head settling over clear deep amber liquid with ample carbonation. The nose is fresh sweet maltiness tempered with flowery hoppiness.

Finishes on a bitter and fruity note, very distinctive & very drinkable!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,woemad,3.97,"My first experience with the famous Steam Beer. This was a 12oz bottle purchased from Huckleberry's in Spokane. Poured a golden amber, small head that dissipated quickly. Fruity, honeyish odor, not unlike a Fuller's ESB. Mouthfeel is surprisingly thick and creamy. Taste starts out sweet and honeyish, gets thicker in the middle, with a nice, mildly hoppy finish. I found this to be a very enjoyable beer, and could probably put away several at a sitting.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,edchicma,4.47,"Good coppery color...Nice head that dissipates quickly. Smell was a nice malty aroma.

Light to medium body. This is a good session beer. It also goes great with food. Anchor Steam is a great classic American microbrew. Any beer lover should certainly taste one. It is a great beer to revisit now and again.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Stubbie1,3.75,This beer poured a dark amber in color and top off with a decent white head. The head gave way to a decent lace. The aroma is malt and musty yeast with a hint of hops. The taste matches the aroma with a nice hop finish at the end. I would call this a medium body and very easy to drink. Very nice!,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Popsinc,3.31,"Beautiful clear, amber pour with a small foamy head. Very appetizing.  The nose was very dull with nothing distinct standing out in my mind. There was a touch of caramel but it seemed very lightly hopped.  The mouthfeel was pleasant and smooth if not creamy.The taste was light with some maltiness to give it body. And there was a touch of caramel on the fuzzy finish with just a hint of fruitiness.....possibly apricot (again, this was minimal).  For the most part a nice drinking experience but not one that i would call memorable.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,kmo1030,3.73,"golden red in color. there wasn't much of a head. I didn't notice much a smell to this beer, it may have been just that it was in a resturant and there was a lot food smells around, but this beer didn't have a very distinctive smell to it. The taste was a pleasant surprise after taking a whiff and not noticing much. it was well balanced with caramel malts and hops. I noticed it was also very spicey, i noticed cinnamon and other baking spices, kind of like pumpkin pie without the pumpkin. Its mouthfeel was surprisingly thin , but not badoverall a real nice beer, good flavor. got tastier as it warmed up.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,marcobrau,3.76,"The big deal with this beer is that it brewed in a unique fashion (fermenting with a lager yeast at ale temps) but that it also was saved from extinction by Fritz Maytag in the 1970s. It's an interesting story but how about the beer?  It is a classic, but it is a classic that must be cared for properly, just like a lot of other good beers. When fresh Anchor Steam has an agressive bitterness that is tempered with a healthy dose of caramel malts. These malts add some sweetness and body and a little bit of a rustic character. If this beer isn't consumed when fresh it tends to be more balanced, and well, kind of boring. It's the fresh hop bitterness that can really grab the attention of your tastebuds. The unique esters obtained from the unique fermentation process are subtle and could be interpreted as faults. I do believe these mineral-like qualities created by the yeast are under-appreciated.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,far333,2.79,"Light iced tea color with no head at all. Faint aroma of hop and florals. Mouthfeel is a bit bubbly and tingly, with carbonation being on the high side. The flavor in general is weak. It consists of mild malt, but there is a distinct metallic undertone to it. A light hop bitterness lingers. I just don't see the attraction to this one.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,feloniousmonk,4.3,"I'd had this in bottles before and thought it was just fine enough, but on first tasting it on draft, my eyes and tastebuds blew wide open, and were all the happier for it! WOW!, what a difference freshness makes! Appearance: clear, bright amber hue, and a frothy, thick off-white head. Aroma: soft and clean, with hints of fruit, bread, cream, nuts. On the palate: smooth and fruity, with a small hop contingent, and very, very tasty. Body is light/ medium, texture is good, finish is long and friendly! The fruity flavor stays on the palate for the greatest portion of this drink, and continues to reward it's consumption. With every sip, the flavor jumps aboard with zeal and vigor, fresh and ready for the task (of refreshment!). Tasty, and tangy, and, again, very giving. A bright, beautiful hybrid beer that goes down smooth and easily, always accompanied by flavor. A great American brewing accomplishment, I always say! I'm forever glad there's always Anchor Steam around!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,stirgy,4.16,"I am partial to this beer. It has always been a favorite and one of the first ""better"" beers that I started drinking. The beer poured a bright amber/copper color and had a huge white and creamy head that clung nicely to the glass. Nice citrusy hop and bitter grainy aroma. Some floral and fresh grass there too. A light to medium bodied beer with a very clean and dry taste. Matched perfect with my Hamburger (well, just about any beer probably would). Finishes crisp and pleasantly bitter. A classic and a good one to revisit from time to time.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,beergeek279,3.85,"On tap at Burgh's in Bridgeville. The color was a dark amber. The smell was that of maltiness. The taste is fairly unique. It's much heavier than a lager, but not quite an ale.........quite a bit of malt in it. Mouthfeel was fairly smooth. As for drinkability, I think I could have a few of these. A unique taste, and as the last surviving example of an otherwise extinct style, and a good solid American beer!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Darkale,3.86,"Pours a thick, even, off-white and creamy head, over a very clear, bronze-orange body.  Aroma is mild, slightly medicinal, musty and hoppy. Good lacing. The head is very resilient and fades slowly to the rim of the glass.  Taste is dry, sour, a bit astringent. Puckering is the word that comes to mind. Mouthfeel is a bit creamy, which is unexpected because it's also raspy. A line of malt taste balances the beer.  It is very difficult to describe the taste of Anchor Steam! It is a kind of dull spice -- it's a pale ale with an aftertaste that is dry and musky. But, it's a pleasant ale to drink, and it's easy to drink many more than one.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,ElGuapo,3.5,"Unless the draught of this brew is that much better than the bottle, my taste buds have greatly changed. I remember not liking this beer too much before. Pours to a deep copper with a pretty good sized white head. It dies a little quick, but leaves lace. Aroma is pleasantly hoppy with a sweetness in the backround. A very nicely hopped brew with good balance. The flavor is all there. The body is medium and it is very smooth. A great drinker. I could session with this one anytime. I'll have to grab a few bottles and see if it is the same.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,WVbeergeek,3.85,"Can honestly say that I have never been too fond of this beer in the bottle, maybe it's the trip across country it has to make to get here but there is always a funky grassy taste going on that does nothing for me. However on draught this beer pours a nice amber with a creamy off white head. Leaving a decent lace around the rim of my mug. The aroma is a sweet caramelly malty aroma with a nice solid back bone of hop aroma. The taste of this beer is unique due to the fact that when they orginally brewed this beer they had lager yeast, but no refrigeration to ferment it as a true lager. So, they fermented this beer at ale temperature using the lager yeast creating the California common or ""steam"" beer style. This beer has a wonderful hop bitterness with sweet apple tones and a nice full malt profile wonderful beer. The mouthfeel is mildly carbonated with a great smooth finish from this medium to light bodied beer. Incredilbly drinkable if obtained freshly.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,AtLagerHeads,3.74,"I had to force the issue of an unfrosted pint glass for this bottled version in a beer bar that does a great job with its draft versions. Having noted that, it was a surprise to me that I could barely raise a single finger of ivory head over the clear amber body on this beer. Perhaps it was just too cold overall. In any case, it did not keep even the minimal head nor did it do any lacing to speak of. It did, however, have a delightfully robust nose that spoke volumes of malt and hints of hops. The taste started full of the malt and sweetness, but finished surprisingly bitter. The aftertaste seemed to moderate the bitterness with a final dry sense. An enjoyable beer that I could enjoy more than one to a sitting. The final strong nose is caramel malt as the brew warmed.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,BierReise,3.7,This is probably one of my favorite american lagers along with Sam Adams. Nice color with slight cloudiness. Aroma is malty and a little hop fragrance. Very smooth on the palate unlike other lagers which have a little more effervescence to them. This was about the only beer on the menu tonight worth having. It's a shame restaurants don't give their beer selection half the attention their wine menus get.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,jreitman,4,Pours a nice amber in color with a lot of head that fades to a slight covering at the end. Incredibly easy drinking and in that respect quite dangerous :) Well balanced and complex to the point taht the hops and malt take turns coming through. A wonderful standby beer.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,dmarch,4.08,It's hard to review a beer that was the first of it's style. It doesn't really matter if this is an ale or a lager because it's a flat out great beer. It's highly carbonated with a dark ruby color and a well retained head. The hops are noticable but don't take away from the sweetness of the malt. This beer certaintly deserves it's reputation.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,lipschitz,3.85,"Appearance: Pours medium amber, with slight chill-haze & nice head with medium density.  Smell: Slight grains, touch of lemon/hops  Taste: Initial caramelized malt, which lingers to slightly bitter pear/apple with a kiss of sweetness. Pleasant hop-level cleans palate, leaving a trace of bitterness on the tongue. As you make your way through this beer, the bitter apple comes through more prominentlyjust nudging out the sweetness of the malt.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, with medium carbonation  Notes: This is a delicious brew that I could drink all night long. While not overly robust, it is tremendously enjoyable. A wonderful stepping stone beer. One that could be used to convert the un-beer-ducated over to the good side. Now that this is available in Canada, it could go a long way to change perceptions of what mainstream American beer is. Plus, the pseudo-stubby bottle should prove to be a hit with Canadian drinkers that are feeling a little nostalgic.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,cokes,3.93,"Ruby bronze with a thin layer of bone cream, disappears over the course of a few minutes. Repressed nose of grain, carmalized sugar, lemon hops and pears. Taste begins with a caramel candy-apple upon a base of grain husks. Still fruity, as the essence of pear and the ghost of sweet grapes enters. A touch earthy midway, prior to the loud arrival of steely, lemon rind hops. Nicely done. A touch fuller than medium bodied. Solid, interesting and quaffable. Worthy of its reputation.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Tballz420,3.81,"It pours out with a nice pillowey head, and bubbles all over in the beer. A darker orange color. Some lacing on the sides of the glass.

28,63,scottum,3.83,Served a copper amber with a small head. A nice brew for sure. Hop bitter is there. Fruity is there with her friend toasty. This beer tastes like liquid pretzels.

I could drink this all night.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,JohnnyDuvel,4,"I haven't had this in quite some time, and hadn't been overly impressed when I did. Upon further review, however, I find this to be quite a nice beer. This would be a good beer to use to try and win over a macro drinker, as it is not too bitter or strong, but miles above the ""big three"". Nice, malty flavor, smooth and a little creamy. Some hop bitterness, but not much (compared to a lot of micros). Pours a nice, amber color, some carbonation, but not too much. Slightly sweet, and I wouldn't drink too many because of that. Overall, a very well balanced and enjoyable beer, from a company that makes consistently terrific product.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Scooter77,4.2,"This is another great beer from Anchor. Pours a nice amber/orange color with an average-sized white bubbly foam. Head fades down, leaving a thin lace on the glass. Scents of citrus fruit seem to blend very well with the hops and malt. The taste is equally as balanced as the aroma. Initial taste was of sweet malt, followed by a zing of citrus, finished off by a nice bitterness of hops. This is an exceptionally balanced and bold beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Nose was very smooth, consisting of unripe pear and natural sugars with a little bit of smokiness, too. Flavor was a lemony citrus, medium smoky, and lightly sweet fruity. Mouthfeel was biting but not in a unctuously hoppy or high alcohol kind of way. The bitterness didn't seem to be hop based and hit my mouth all high and up front in the roof of my mouth. Real long and drying finish, but not obnoxiously so.  A very soft and smooth nosed beer considering how lemon, smoky, and uniquely bitter this strange brew is. Truly unique as everyone has said. Definitely picking sixers of this to keep around the fridge. Fabulous.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Nose is sweet malts and caramel with a touch of floral hops. Medium in body with a good amount of carbonation and a creamy mouthfeel. Taste is raw grains and bitter hop resins up front with a bit of lemon rind followed by notes of sweet toasted malts and caramelized sugar. A bit of lemony citrus is present in the aftertaste. Simply a classic brew that is a must try for anyone.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Mitchster,3.06,"Crystal clear, light caramel-amber in color with a decent beige head and excellent retention atop medium bubbles and moderately-strong carbonation. Lacing is adequate. Aroma is grainy, husky, lightly caramel, yeasty with some ""primary dredge"" characteristics. Hops are not very abundant in aroma. Mouthfeel is initially fizzy with a medium body. Taste starts with a fizzy, clean amber malt profile, some mild, gritty, earthy flavor hops, penetrated by some mild yeasty fusels and sulfur midway through, then ending in a pleasant, lingering grainy sweetness balanced by smooth, earthy hops. Everything simmers and becomes more round after warming. An American classic in it's own right...a good alternative to ESB's, but it just doesn't do much for me.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Fairly malty taste with some hop-bitterness. Has a prickly, medium-bodied mouthfeel. This is a pretty good lager - one of the better ones I've had (and they haven't been too many - I'm more of an ale man). Definitely a session beer. I'd make this my regular lager, but it's a little on the expensive side here in the Boston area.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,44ouncer,3.95,"As tasted in the hospitality room after a tour of the brewery in San Francisco. Actually got yelled at by Fritz Maytag because I was heading toward the employees' bathroom instead of the one for brewery guests. Sorry, Fritz.  Appearance a wonderful golden red. Terrific smell -- a terrific blend of all the ingredients. The hops, the malt, everything. A smooth, rich taste, with just enough of a bite to remind you that this is an adult beverage. Not too harsh, though. Pefect. Mouthfeel was very smooth, yet rich. As far as drinkability was concerned, it's a great beer to sit around with family and friends with.  If you're ever planning on coming to San Francisco, make sure you make your reservations for the brewery tour ASAP. They only do them once a day -- for 12 or so people. You won't be disappointed!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,GreatPondBrewer,3.76,"I am excited to finally review this classic! Anchor poured very smoothly, revealing a light copper/red color with a 1/2 a finger thick off-white head that remained the entire way down the glass. The only complaint was the smell. There wasn't any. It just smelled like ""beer"". The taste on the other hand was great. There was a nice hop bitterness that attcked the front of my tongue while a more mellow malted flavor pleased the back. The aftertaste was tart with some notes of apple. This had a unique lager style taste that I do not think I have ever tasted before. The mouthfeel was well carbonated and creamy. One of the more distinct american beers around. try it if you can.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,AudioGilz,3.8,"A very drinkable session beer. It's clear amber with a small off-white head. I sense just a bit of floral hops in the aroma, nothing pungent. A zesty carbonation treats the tongue, as well as a perfectly balanced hop and malt combo, more hops at first. The finish is dry, crisp, and refreshing. I'm pleased that I finally tried this classic....highly recommended.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Kunsan90,3.65,"The beer poured a clear amber/orange with a healthy off white head. As the head receded to shallow film, a little lace work was left behind. It smelled of malt with a fruity/lemony hint. The taste matched the smell, malty with fruity aftertastes that finishes off with a slight hop bite. It felt nice and somewhat full in the mouth and with an initial malty hit followed by the hit of hops. This is a very drinkable beer that I had been looking forward to trying, and it did not let me down. Obviously against a macro there is no choice, but still this is a beer that I will buy again and offer to friends.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,budgood1,4.21,"can't believe i haven't reviewed this classic yet!  anchor steam pours out a hazy amber color. there was the slightest bit of sediment on the bottom of the bottle that i made sure i swirled in. a foamy head dies to a fine lace. not much in the nose except some slight fruity maltiness and a bit of floral hops. tastes very fruity...maltiness evident and a slight stinging hop bite. a lot going on here. the creamy mouthfeel isn't really smooth, so to speak...adding to the unique and rough profile. alchohol is noticeable, and so is a slight sulphur note on the palate. seemingly full bodied; an enigmatic beer to say the least. finishes with a hop attitude which i found stimulating and pleasing to my taste buds. i can see why this is an all time classic. another brew i could easily drink many of!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Bruiser81,3.65,This brew poured a clear amber orange color with a small off-white head the did last. The aroma was hoppy with a flowery-citrus background. The taste was also citrus with sort of a lemony zest with a finish that had a fairly bitter hoppy finish. There was a good amount of carbonation and the beer went down easily. This would be a good summertime beer as it is crisp and refreshing.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,maxpower,3.7,"Pours a clear amber color, has an average sized foamy white head that last. Has a grainy, bready flowery aroma. Light and balanced hop and malt flavors, medium body with a dry crisp finish, this may be on of the easiest drinking beers I have ever had.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,AtrumAnimus,3.7,Hoppy nose and taste. It has a decent golden amber color. and a moderate head that is short lived. Kind of has a stick to the roof of your mouth yet smooth texture in regards to mouthfeel. It has a very bitter finish that is a bit off and lacking balance. Overall a somewhat drinkable beer but not a great beer.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Naerhu,3.82,"Deep, opaque copper/red color. Decent head, with the tiniest micro-bubbles, which turn into elegant lace. I like this beer because it has character, but is unobtrusive. It is yummy and interesting, yet it does not get in the way of dinner. It has a malty flavor on a medium body, with light hop bitterness. The high carbonation further enhances this beers with food profile for me.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Realale,3.88,"Deep reddish copper color. Pours with a nice tight 1/2 inch head, that settles slowly, becoming lacy along the way. A very appetizing pint!  Nose is caramel malt, with some fruity notes. There is a mineral quality there as well - a bit like wet concrete, actually.  Very well balanced on the palate. There is a lot of malt, with a substantial crystal component, but there is plenty of bitterness there to counter it, as well as some nice hop flavor.  A bit over-carbonated, but that's the fault of the bar, not Anchor, I hope. The over-carb decreases my drinkability - this is dehydration city waiting to happen.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,MJR,4,"Appearance: Pours an amber-red color with copper edges. The head was huge to start with, because I poured down the center of the glass, but shrank to a solid, 3/4' cap with good lacing.  Smell: Lots of esters and fruitiness balanced with a good dose of hops.  Taste: Carrys over that balance of sweet malt and fruit and hop bitterness from the nose. The hop flavor is a bit on the coarse side...I like that. Finishes more to the bitter side.  Mouthfeel: Fairly medium bodied with a mouthfeel that bounces back and forth from oily and juicy, to dry and crisp.  Drinkability: Very good. It's modest alcohol, lighter body, and fairly simple flavor profile make this an easy choice.  While it may not be on anybody's 'Best of' list, it's a rock-solid and dependable brew that never fails to please. The granddaddy and precursor of all American micros.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,francisweizen,4.2,"This is perhaps the best Amber beer I have ever had the privelage to drink. This is kind of similar to yuenglings lager, but it is oh, so much better! This pours a wonderful amber colour and smells of malts and hops. This tastes like a wonderfully balance beer should. Although it is a little light on the hops for my tastes(although I do love the malts too!:-) This has a creamy and smooth mouthfeel and an almost unlimited drinkability making it a great choice for a session beer! F",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,kunzbrew,3.85,"Pours a pale copper color with very little head, that leaves a sexy lace behind. Earthy notes in the smell of the malt is very nice. The hops flavor is strong yet nice with that musty note. This is a great steam beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Brewzzle,3.28,"As the only commercially available Steam style beer I have found I am not sure if it is good or bad example, I can say though that it left a bad taste in my mouth.  It pours to a nice amber color with a head that disappears quickly. Just after pouring there is a slight citrus hint on the nose, as the beer warms a little there is a slightly stale/yeast aroma.  The initial mouthfeel is pleasing, a medium body, rolls around the mouth nicely, however this is where the nicer qualities stop. There is a strong yeast taste, almost like a bread yeast (perhaps something to do with a high fermentation temp?). A subtle hop bitterness at first which lingers and accentuates as an unpleasant `tea' like bitterness as an aftertaste.  Overall, it pretty much met my expectation of a beer style that originated as a crudely made beer, made under hot and trying conditions. Not for me, but a unique beer and probably enjoyed by many.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,JISurfer,4.05,"This is a real winner if you like amber beers. Has a nice wheaty taste, with some faint fruit flavors. Not much of a head to it, but that is to be expected. Also, there was a tinge of hops, but it was balanced well enough for me. ""Goes down smooth and never lets you down"". Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,johnrobe,3.95,"One of the classics. Highly quaffable and a fantastic session brew, this is also what I would call a very food-friendly beer. I was first introduced to this beer in an excellent San Francisco seafood restaurant, Rocco's, where it paired very well with an italian shellfish/pasta dish. It pours a light amber in the glass with an off-white head that shrinks to a cap. The smell is of bready malt, some grain, light caramel tones and herbal hops. Carbonation is crisp and tightly knit. Tea-like hops dominate, providing a signature bitter bite, with grain and some caramel malt coming up for support. A light-medium bodied brew.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Shiloh,3.78,Darker than anticipated and cloudy. Minimum head and certainly full bodied but somewhat bitter with an after taste that will not leave you alone..in a very positive way...Not a good brew for dinning as to its weight...but certainly a session beer...,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Jarod,3.63,"It pours into the glass a clear dark gold/copper caramel color. The head is not too thick but large. The lace on the sides is quiet evident to the end of the glass. The aroma is of malt, caramel, hops, floral and some spices. The taste in the beginning has hints of caramel (slightly sweet) then hoppy. Followed by some citrus and a little bitter. It then goes slightly sweet again before it finishes somewhat dry. The flavor stays with you a little while after. Not what it used to be, but it is still a good starter beer.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Jon,3.95,"Here's a hopped-up lager typical of a west coast brewery. You certainly won't hear me complaining. Pours a pristine copper color with a thick, foamy head. Looks pretty good at first, and the smell is inviting, too. Notes of sweet malt and maybe a bit of spicy hops are evident. Taste is diverse with notes of the sweet malts at first, countered by the spicy hops toward mid-glass. Mouthfeel is rather grainy, which may take away from the drinkability a bit. Overall, though, this is a classic brew and one I've been fond of for quite some time.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,IrishRedRock,3.88,"Inviting copper color with a thin white lace on top. Some malt and a bit of spice show up in the aroma. Mouthfeel has some stronger carbonation than I expected, but the taste is rather crisp and pleasantly bitter. This is a good lager with some surprising hop flavor. I enjoyed it!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,BeerAngel,4.15,"A truly good beer! Pours a very clear light caramel color with a medium off-white head that leaves a lace down the glass. The smell is that of a non-complex, yet inviting caramel and malt. This is one ""hopped-up"" lager with tastes of a repeat of the aromas along with a crisp hop bite. It is light bodied and very well balanced. Maybe not totally true to the style in the hops category, who cares...this one is very good and has character to be remembered! Cheers!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,zerk,3.86,"A very unique beer... copper / amber with a thin white head... leaves a good lace on the glass. Malta aroma, some caramel and spice. Upfront, the flavor has a grainy charateristic, then bitter hops, followed by a slight sweetness. Has a rough mouthfeel, and a meduim body. It's been years since I tried this one... and this was probably one of the first micros I can remember truely enjoing. A classic.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,BeerManDan,3.2,"Although it pours a nice clear yellow, I think don't think that it's an exceptional beer to be rated above average.

Will try again later!",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,allboutbierge,3.99,"Tastes like no other amber I have ever had before. Floral taste with a crisp hoppy-bitter aftertaste. After a few sips it became one of my favorite beers.

28,63,Lupe,4.12,"Pours a amber-copper color nice, thick and chunky head (that dissipates quick) that leaves nice lace. Great apperance, makes your mouth water just looking at it. Not much to the smell, some malt and floral hop aroma, but what it lacks in smell it makes up for in taste. Medium bodied with a nice mouthfeel, especially for a lager. Starts with light caramel malt taste which then leads the way toward the hops. Some citrus flavor and a crisp bitterness lead to a dry finish and a lasting aftertaste. Very good.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,bewareOFpenguin,4,"My first taste of a microbrew was this beer. My friend used to steal it from his fathers package store.

I definitely recommend this all.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,proc,4,A fine beer. On-tap this tastes crisper than out of the bottle. A fine bronze color in the glass with enough malt to let you know its there. The hops hit the palate which grabs you due to the fact its a lager and you may not be ready for a hops from a lager. Very drinkable.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,zakery,4.03,"Appearance: A decent white head on a clear and light amber body.  Smell: Some very shy caramel-malt aromas are peeking out. They become a little more noticable as the beer warms up; don't serve this one too cold.  Taste: Hop bitterness comes first, then the maltier tastes. The hop aromas are mostly noticable in the after-taste before the hop bitterness takes over again in a long dry finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with medium carbonation.  It's nice whenever you come across a beer that is not afraid to show some bitter hop character and not only hop aromas.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,TheLongBeachBum,4.11,"The first ever US Beer that I tried when I lived in England, I immediately fell in love with it then, and I still love it today - many, many years later. Lovely deep amber / light copper colored beer that pours with a good head that soon dissipates (as with all bottled Anchor Beers I find). Not much nose, but what it lacks in smell, it makes up for in taste. Lovely mild bitterness with a dryish finish that begs the next mouthfull. Just right for the times when you fancy ""a few"" beers. Lovely supremely balanced Session Beer that I personally find very Quaffable. First time I found it in England, it was described as Americas only indeginous beer style. Hard to believe this Brewery nearly bit the dust.

28,63,aaronh,3.5,"I was not impressed by this beer. It exhibited nice grassy aromas and had a more robust color than I was expecting, but the flavors were disappointing.

28,63,JeffreyG,4.55,I had this beer for the first time about two months ago. I found that after couple of weeks of having this beer (I had had just one) I was seriously craving it. It has a great deep amber color to it with a foamy head. It's taste is a great balance of malty richness followed by just the right amount of hop finish. This has quickly become one of my favorites. And I love the unique bottle shape as well.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,bditty187,4,"Tawny-brown with a smallish off-white head that wanes to a trace. The bouquet is very unique and very inviting. An earthy-malt and caramel/sugary aroma delights your nose. The taste is divine, it really is. I was completely impressed with it. The taste is complex enough with suggestions of malt and caramel. This beers bitterness steels the show. A twang of fruit at the end rounds off the brew nicely.  I think this would be a great beer to widen the horizons of macro-drinkers. Try one.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87

Like a carnival in some nowhere town on the Bay or New Jersey or Cape Cod. I remember the last time in Sanfran, passing time in a bar, I ordered one of these on tap. My expectations were low, based probably on less-than-fresh bottles consumed in MI. But they didn't have any other good choices so... It was absolutely beautiful. Perfect, fresh and living. I recall it was lighter in color than what is in front of me now. Is this bottle contract-brewed somewhere other than in SF? There is no definitive statement of origin on the label.

I pick up a mix of both malt sweetness and hops in the nose, with the hops being somewhat more prevalent. Had a good, middle-of-the-road body, and felt good over the tongue. Malt starts things off, with some caramel-like flavors. From there, hops take over, with a citrus notes bouncing around on the palate.

Appearance: Hazy copper with a thick, off-white, rocky, bubbly, sticky, chunky head.  Smell: Earthy malt aromas with semi-caramel sweetness.  Taste: Immediately, the mouth is hit by a sharp bitterness, some salt and slight lemon from the hops. This is a beautiful thing, full of flavour and character. After, a mildly astringent, earthy, highly toasted malt guides you to a dry, grainy, residual citrus after-taste.  Notes: You don't find other beers like this, not even close in their mimics.

28,63,Jordan,4.42,Anchor Steam.. It really is a style of it's own. It mimics an ESB more than an Amber.  Pretty looking deep dark copper. Very romancing whiffs of herbs inside a quieter background of caramel malts and even some banana. The sweet-bitterness to this beer is definately one of a kind! Perfect dichotomy of sweet caramel malts and course hops bitters. Anchor Steam has great character and a complex palate to match.  Excellent on tap as well.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,marc77,3.93,"Orange - amber in hue w/ a very slight haze. The thin, but tight head leaves a respectable lace. Light caramel malt notes and toasted malt comprise the malt aroma, while an assertive woody Northern Brewer hop nose follows. Lightly bodied, and highly carbonated, but the ample residual dextrins make for a smooth, crisp, and pleasant mouthfeel. The woody, slightly earthy hop flavor is expected from the hop variety used. Hop bitterness overpowers malt sweetness, yet isn't overbearing. The finish is clean with just a hint of esters.

Big fan of Anchor's Porter, though.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,rastaman,3.13,"Good session beer, light in flavour, aswell as having a good hop profile, and well rounded flavour, very nice.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,garymuchow,4.21,"Served from a bottle. Very big head, foamy noisey and lasted a long time. Clear with a copper colored amber. Surprisingly light nose, that was dominated by malt. Smooth malt character to the taste with sharp bitterness surrounding it. Finishes long and dry. Nice and full mouthfeel adds to the enjoyment. Feels like your really drinking something with some body, especially since it's not a stout or porter. This would be an easy beer in which to enjoy several.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Todd,3.86,"Ah ... an American micro-classic, and a most distinct and unique beer. Hazy medium-amber, creamy tight bubbled head. Fairly clean aroma with slight bubble-gum and sulfur notes. Very carbonated, creamy with a lot of complexities, raw feel, grain and hops tannin astringencies and background sulfur. Toasted malt flavours come thru with a touch of caramel and sugary flavour as the beer warms to room temperature. Definite fruity character. Hops are bitter, but soft on the palate. Flavours linger into a grain dry finish.  Simply an all around good beer, with decent balance and incredible character. Used to treat myself to this beer when I was cutting my teeth into the better beer world ages ago. Everyone should at least try this beer once.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,hooligan,3.86,"On tap, this beer has been fairly consistent, and one of my favorite summertime brews. The crispness of this beer makes it a easy drinking one. The bottled is very good, but as others have stated, can be quite inconsistent, with a metallic, stale, almost oxygenated taste to it...",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,John,3.66,First had Anchor Steam at this hippie shrine kinda joint called Vesuvio in San Fran about ten years ago. I was thrilled at the time. Still pretty good stuff.,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,AaronRed,4.66,A classic beer. Such a distinctive taste; never gets old,Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,DrDocRudge,3.8,"While the color and smell say drink this one, I find that each bottle has a nasty metallic aftertaste to it. In addition, the beer seems watery in comparison to other ales, though firmer than all pilsners and most lagers. Some people swear by this beer, I just swear at it. Much better than Bud or Coors though.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,gwfrankpsu,4,"This is a terrific beer, while agree that this is one of the best around it pales to a Liberty Ale. But I degress, take your Bud swilling friends and have them try an Anchor Steam - the shock will do them good.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
28,63,Brent,4,"Very ale-like in character, with distinct malt. This brewery knows how to turn out quality products.",Anchor Brewing Company,"California, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,87
